	<brief_summary>A study determine three license bisphosphonates ( alendronate , ibandronate risedronate ) : ) affect peripheral skeleton differently , assess quantitative ultrasound bone ( QUS ) , peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) dual−energy x−ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) ? b ) different effect bone cell activity assess flow cytometry biochemical marker bone cell activity ? The aim study compare effect three license bisphosphonates bone quantity quality . There study . Most measure bone quantity quality use protocol study three agent . The novelty study necessitate establishment reference range explains need inclusion group young woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bisphosphonate Action Appendicular Skeleton : Evidence Differential Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There number randomise controlled trial examine effect bisphosphonates fracture risk . The result trial uniform , especially relation non−vertebral fracture . We propose much fracture risk reduction risedronate explain reduction bone resorption marker ( Eastell et al , 2003 ) . Each three bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption marker , alendronate ibandronate least effective risedronate regard . However , direct comparison different bisphosphonates surrogate endpoint bone mineral density bone turnover marker . This raise question whether bisphosphonates might affect aspect bone strength , 'bone quality ' . The purpose study determine whether three licensed bisphosphonates affect skeleton differently use variety method ( various bone densitometry device ultrasound measurement bone ) variety bone site ( spine , hip , finger , heel , forearm leg ) . These change compare change marker bone health biochemical marker bone turnover help u determine possible mechanism action different treatment . The study last 48 week long enough detect signfiicant change bone strength measure DXA spine/hip . As interested change occur visit first three month study last 9 month study . This expect help u detect difference onset effect three treatment clearly . Study vists : screening , baseline 1 , baseline 2 , 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 12 week , 13 week ( phone call participant 24 36 week ) , 48 week 49 week . The two baseline visit allow duplicate measurement bone stregth/quality different occasion start study minimise variability . Treatment begin baseline 2 ( 0 day ) last 48 week . The visit 13 week 49 week perform bone density/quality test duplicate minimise variability baseline visit . Bone mineral density various bone ( hip/spine/whole body forearm ) measure DXA various device , quantitative ultrasound perform heel finger , bone quality measure pQCT forearm tibia/3D analysis hip scan baseline visit , 12 13 week 48 49 week visit Surrogate marker bone health ( biochemical marker bone turnover ) measure baseline , 1 , 2 4 , 12 , 13 , 48 49 week . Exploratory method include protocol include : Assessing number bone break cell number ( osteoclast ) baseline , 1 week 48 week Assessing nail brittleness baseline 12 48 week . Subjects randomise use stratification method ensure group equal range bone strength study entry . Randomisation perform hospital pharmacy . The study blind subject know treatment . Subjects ask discus assign treatment staff perform bone measurement . There placebo group trial subject take one three treatment . We choose active comparator design many measurement ( especially biochemical cellular one ) change unless treatment give ; also , treatment indicate effective patient group . To generate control data recruit group 200 healthy young woman age 35−40 year . The control group undertake measurement bone strength/quality treatment group well biochemical maerkers bone turnover . There 2 study visit control group , baseline 48 week . This data serve internal control reference range device use study . Ethical consideration study include use ionise radiation , blood sample study visit number study visit . This may balance close monitoring subject whilst study thorough assessment bone health 49 week . Research participant , patient group community involve design research study . The hypothesis study bisphosphonates vary magnitude effect non−vertebral fracture reflect different change measure bone quality ( QUS ) , bone density appendicular skeleton ( DXA pQCT ) novel biochemical marker bone resorption osteoclast precursor .</detailed_description>
