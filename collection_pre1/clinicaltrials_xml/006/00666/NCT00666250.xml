	<brief_title>Effects Xoçai Antioxidant Supplements Atherosclerosis Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Introduction It long know increased intake plant product result reduce risk atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease , important cause death disability Western society . This protective effect find correlate increase plasma level various antioxidant vitamin along expect increase resistance plasma oxidation , reduce evidence oxidation lipoproteins plasma component . It also long understood oxidize LDL , related lipoprotein also contain apo B-100 , primary drive force process atherogenesis . These two fact lead strong interest develop antioxidant treatment likely effective atheropreventive measure . This quest take form several large , long-term interventional study , patient give purified antioxidant vitamin effort reduce cardiovascular event . Surprisingly , almost without exception intervention fail show favorable effect . The cause paradox remain unknown , may result either reliance antioxidant vitamin , rather antioxidant element diet , use highly purified product , instead lightly process food element . Cocoa mass ( cocoa powder dry form ) edible non-fat part cacao bean remain fatty cocoa butter remove . Cocoa mass powder rich source polyphenol antioxidant flavonoid family . The predominant flavonoid cocoa flavonols , include oligomeric proanthocyanidins ( procyanidins prodelphinidins ) monomeric catechin epicatechins . Recent study show chocolate preparation high cocoa ( thus high flavonol content ) may several beneficial effect vasculature various risk factor atherosclerosis . These likely beneficial effect include : 1 . Increased vascular reactivity 2 . Improved arterial compliance 3 . Increased HDL-C level , 4 . Decreased oxidation LDL , 5 . Reduced insulin resistance . Although several study compare preparation low vs. high content cocoa ( flavonols ) , one study aware test effect source chocolate high-fat chocolate bar . Only non-bar product readily exclude cocoa butter and/or butterfat thus low fat content . Meanwhile relatively high fat content chocolate bar , even make high cocoa powder content ( thus `` dark '' chocolate bar ) add many calorie product may well reduce beneficial effect cocoa . Apparently also , preparation test publish study relatively high sugar content , also add calorie may reduce benefit cocoa . In addition many inconsistency among study standard chocolate preparation regard above-mentioned beneficial effect ( example , study fail show lipid anti-inflammatory effect ) , inconsistency may relate various issue . First , elements chocolate-containing food , cocoa mass powder appear contain virtually antioxidant factor . Variability cocoa powder content , possible blunt benefit addition variable amount cocoa butter might variably reduce beneficial effect . Second , alkaline processing cocoa ( routine virtually bar powder chocolate product ) may reduce antioxidant content activity . Thus , variability publish result among various chocolate preparation could due difference degree type processing cocoa ( result difference antioxidant content ) , and/or difference presence component ( fat and/or sugar ) might block beneficial effect cocoa . Açai fruit appear even great content antioxidant polyphenols ( primarily anthocyanins ) cocoa mass powder , especially preserve fresh açai juice freeze-dried açai powder . Açai know contain many vitamin mineral well fat , rich source phytosterols . It say able low LDL level , likely unsaturated monounsaturated fat content . It also say anti-inflammatory effect . Although process freeze-dried açai powder remove fat , phytosterols dietary fiber , unique potential açai appear primarily many anthocyanin antioxidant , best preserve freeze-dried powder . Unfortunately , contrast many study chocolate , appear publish scientific study physiologic effect Açai ( antioxidant otherwise ) human . A recent lay review açai Alexander G. Schauss , PhD , FACN ( `` Açai : The Nutritional Antioxidant-Rich Amazonian Palm Tree Fruit , '' Sound Concepts , 2005 ) , state human study perform açai first scientific article currently preparation . Dr Schauss mention , however , detail method result study . Blueberries , grape pepper natural antioxidant , albeit far less quantity acai . With exception grape , vivo effect antioxidant-rich fruit human subject little studied . Research intake alcoholic non-alcoholic grape product ( lighter- darker-colored grape ) show significant antioxidant effect , especially dark grape . Any effect grapes atherosclerosis many standard risk factor remain controversial best , many case unknown . Given encouraging scientific data regard antioxidant vascular effect cocoa grape human subject , study non-vitamin antioxidant-rich food product clearly warrant . The study product , Xoçai Activ drink , carefully design try maximize antioxidant content effect pleasant-tasting natural food product . It achieve ( 1 ) include many ingredient naturally high antioxidant content , cocoa powder , Acai , grape blueberry powder . ( 2 ) minimize process component , ( 3 ) eliminating add fat minimize potential interference likely favorable effect main ingredient , minimize total caloric content . In light high antioxidant content ( manifest high ORAC , etc . ) Xoçai Activ prime candidate study antioxidant effect human vivo . If study show significant effect clinical-relevant endpoint , lipid , glucose tolerance , blood pressure , vascular function , would indicate clinical disease prevent antioxidant supplement therapy . Objectives : Hypotheses We hypothesize give human subject : 1 . Xoçai Activ dose-dependent antioxidant effect human subject 2 . Xoçai Activ improve several atherosclerosis risk factor dose-dependent manner : Specific Aims We perform open-label pilot dose-response study test hypotheses measure various individual factor relate aim . All study parameter measure baseline end two treatment period two week , one low dose ( 1 square three times/d ) high dose ( two square three times/d ) . The study last 5 week , count screen portion . Patient Selection Criteria Subjects study 5 men 5 woman . All subject 18-79 year age , body mass index &lt; 35 , good general health . Subjects exclude regularly use lipid-altering medication ( include niacin 100 mg/d DHA/EPA one gram/d ) , alcohol , tobacco antioxidant supplement ( standard multiple vitamin ) history active liver , renal , thyroid disease , active cancer . Study Design : The study do 10 subject endpoint measure screening , baseline every 2 week 4 week treatment . The first two week study , participant instruct drink three one-ounce serving Xocai Activ day . The second two week , participant instruct drink three three-ounce serving Xocai Activ day ( nine ounce daily ) . Subjects carefully instruct mix dry Xocai Activ powder correct amount water proper amount Xocai Activ consume low- high-dose period . There total 7 clinic visit total 470 mL blood take . Due difficulty prepare placebo intervention , study double-blinded . We however , blind measurement laboratory assay . Study Endpoints : All blood urine take , vascular body composition measurement perform 12-hour overnight fast twice baseline period twice end 2-week period intervention . Diet : Subjects routine diet assess two baseline visit , end study mean 3-day food record . They instruct consume antioxidant supplement , minimize consumption high antioxidant food ( chocolate , blueberry , red grape , etc . ) study . Laboratory measurement : Antioxidant level activity primary endpoint study measure baseline dose subject . Vascular measurement : Blood pressure vascular function favorably affect Xoçai , measure standard , establish method research clinic . Body composition : We anticipate effect Xoçai may determine part body composition , obese subject , great abnormality oxidation , inflammation , lipid vascular function , great response . We measure body composition percent body fat bioelectrical impedance . Study data obtain laboratory Dr. Nanjee analyze investigator . Confidentiality maintain divulge personal information beyond directly involve subject contact data collection , maintain hard copy subject record lock file . Computer file personal information identify subject keep exclusively secure password-protected computer file . Data analysis perform use file identify patient subject number .</detailed_description>
