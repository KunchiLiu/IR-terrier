	<brief_summary>The study aim determine efficacy best method predict hip fracture diagnose post-menopausal osteoporosis use three dimensional structural engineering model ( SEMs ) proximal femoral bone produce use Hologic Discovery duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanner Hologic 's new 3D Hip ( TM ) software comparison three dimensional SEMs produce use quantitative compute tomography - current gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Imaging Hip Using DXA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurements dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) available clinician past 20 year use forms basis current clinical practice guideline . The measurement useful , could improve upon take account third dimension bone ( depth ) distribution mineral within bone . The value diagnostic test depend greatly strength association measurement outcome . If find new approach strengthen ability hip DXA measurement predict fracture greatly improve diagnostic test well identify patient treat . Further , test would allow good evaluation new therapy osteoporosis , particularly may alter bone geometry , include anabolic agent teriparatide . Patients attend study visit complete basic questionnaire collect information bone health lifestyle ( current Metabolic Bone Centre standard questionnaire ) . Patients also undergo DXA scan hips Hologic Discovery DXA machine use new 3D imaging technique call '3D HipTM ' . Hologic process 3D HipTM scan provide u volumetric dataset scan provide u high performance PC software u process on-site . They already instal software upgrade necessary hardware Discovery densitometry system enhance 3D HipTM capability . Patients attend CT scan hip medical imaging department Northern General Hosptial per standard practice . 50 postmenopausal woman recently suffer hip fracture recruit study . 50 postmenopausal age match control also recruit . Subjects give inform consent study visit arrange attend DXA scan CT scan . At study visit basic demographic data brief medical history collect study specific Case Report Forms ( CRF ) . The intended outcome study 1 ) To establish diagnostic accuracy hip fracture 3D HipTM SEMs derive 3D HipTM , determine much well 3D HipTM traditional 2D DXA case control study . 2 ) To compare three dimensional SEMs proximal femur derive 3D Hip ( TM ) simulate SEMs derive use quantitative compute tomography .</detailed_description>
