	<brief_title>A Study Determine Effects Investigational Malaria Vaccine Given Adults Living United States Thereafter Adults Living Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study begin US phase 26 volunteer age 18 50 year enrol receive investigational malaria vaccine . The vaccine make malaria protein FMP010 mixed adjuvant AS01B . Since vaccine yet human , first , 5 volunteer get small ( 10 µg ) dose FMP010 AS01B . If safe , 20 volunteer get 50 µg FMP010 AS01B . Vaccinations give IM deltoid non-dominant arm , every month 3 month . After vaccination , subject follow clinical trial evaluation adverse event . There blood draw assess safety vaccine well level immune response generate vaccine . Upon receipt preliminary safety result , Kenya phase begin 30 volunteer randomize receive either 50 µg FMP010 AS01B ( 20 ) rabies vaccine ( 10 ) .
