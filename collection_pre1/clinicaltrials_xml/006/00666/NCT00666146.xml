	<brief_summary>We propose recruit 150 case family ( i.e. , family schizophrenia proband ) , 150 control family , 45 control subject exhibit schizophrenia spectrum personality symptom absence family history schizophrenia . Participants undergo number clinical , electrophysiological , perceptual , cognitive assessment . These data use identify phenotype likely associate genetic risk schizophrenia , determine phenotype aggregate family . Some analysis focus examine association candidate gene alternative phenotype . Thus able recruit relative may still collect phenotypic data probands genetic sample future genotype/phenotype association study . Testing procedure require 10-12 hour time commitment test complete 2 day . Participants ask give blood ( saliva difficult obtain blood sample instance fear blood draw ) , stored future genetic analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aim propose study : 1 . To test hypothesis abnormality predictive pursuit , antisaccade performance , work memory , visual attention ( CPT ) , sensory gating ( PPI P50 ) measure information process mark liability schizophrenia . Secondly , examine pattern familial aggregation measure determine whether observed deficit likely reflect genetic and/or environmental effect . The hypothesis support ( ) frequency neurophysiological deficit higher relatives schizophrenic probands relative control probands ; ( b ) prevalence neurophysiological abnormality higher case relatives SSP symptom nonSSP case relatives ; ( c ) risk increase among case relatives `` affected '' probands vs. case relatives `` unaffected '' probands ( i.e. , risk relative case probands exhibit abnormality vs. relatives case probands ) . 2 . To test hypothesis physiological deficit reflect common underlying phenotype , others mark independent aspect disease risk . To test hypothesis ( ) examine correlation matrix ( adjust within family correlation ) neurophysiological assessment among case relative control relatives . Factor structure two group examine use exploratory factor analysis , follow confirmatory factor analysis use validation sample case/control relative . Confirmatory Factor Analyses ( CFA ) also use determine factor solution base case/control relatives fit data case probands . ( b ) Factor score correlate measure derive familial risk composite measure neurophysiological functioning estimate use method describe Specific Aim 1 . ( c ) Secondary within family analysis perform estimate heritability derive factor score determine whether pattern familial correlation suggest genetic environmental cause . 3 . To evaluate whether particular domain psychopathology mark different putative phenotypic marker . We specifically test hypothesis predictive pursuit , work memory , sensory gating measure strongly associate positive psychotic symptom , smooth pursuit initiation process speed measure strongly associate primary negative symptom . The relationship clinical domain measure cluster examine exploratory hypothesis-generating framework . 4 . We propose collect blood sample ( rarely saliva sample ) participant store future association study , well formal linkage analysis use phenotype identify specific aim 1 2 . 5 . We plan examine nicotine dependence may run family examine pattern nicotine use may relate family history schizophrenia . Participants ask smoke history current smoking habit . Current smoker ask specific question smoke behavior estimate level current nicotine dependence . It hop information give u clue many individual schizophrenia smoke .</detailed_description>
