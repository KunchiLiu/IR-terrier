	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give gossypol together androgen ablation therapy work treat patient newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer . Gossypol may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Androgens cause growth prostate tumor cell . Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist drug , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Giving gossypol together androgen ablation therapy may effective treatment prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R- ( - ) -Gossypol Androgen Ablation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine percentage patient newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer demonstrate undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ( &lt; 0.2 ng/mL ) 7 month treat R- ( - ) -gossypol ( AT-101 ) androgen ablation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety regimen patient . II . To determine percentage patient PSA &gt; = 4.0 ng/mL , overall PSA &lt; 4.0 ng/mL , PSA &gt; = 0.2 ng/mL &lt; 4.0 ng/mL first 7 month therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive R- ( - ) -gossypol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive bicalutamide PO QD begin 6 week initiation R- ( - ) -gossypol continue completion treatment , discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically proven adenocarcinoma prostate clinical stage D2 disease define soft tissue bony metastasis . Patients must elevate PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml within 12 week prior registration . Androgen ablation therapy , must include LHRH agonist , begin 6 week prior initiation AT101 . Patients allow prior local therapy radiation surgery . Patients must receive 12 month androgen ablation therapy antiandrogen therapy adjuvant/neoadjuvant set prior androgen ablation therapy metastatic disease , beyond six week induction period prior initiation AT101 . Patients prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant androgen ablation therapy must complete therapy least 12 month prior . Must 18 year old old . Life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal There must plan receive concomitant chemotherapy radiation therapy study period . Baseline study PSA value must obtain reference laboratory . The effect AT101 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason men and/or partner must agree use adequate contraception , ( include hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Exclusion Criteria Patients radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AT101 agent use study . Patients bilateral orchiectomy eligible . Patients present acute cord compression eligible . History bowel obstruction GI dismotility disorder . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease ) impair ability swallow retain AT101 tablet . Requirement routine use hematopoietic growth factor ( include granulocyte colony stimulate factor , granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor , interleukin11 ) platelet transfusion maintain absolute neutrophil count platelet count require threshold study entry . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction AT101 .</criteria>
