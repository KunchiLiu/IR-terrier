	<detailed_description>Thyroidectomy one frequently perform operation endocrine surgery . Results generally excellent , morbidity mortality usually negligible . The operation require proper identification important structure recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) parathyroid gland . Meticulous dissection exhaustive hemostasis important ensure dry field avoid inadvertent damage adjacent structure . The two common technique hemostasis suture ligatures electrocoagulation . The use electrocoagulation ( EC ) control bleed potential risk injure surround structure lateral dispersion heat . New haemostatic technique develop advent laparoscopic surgery . Among thing , ultrasound instrument use dissection , division coagulation vessel tissue . Previous study Thyroidectomy observe clinically economically significant reduction operating time increase complication rate Harmonic device use . The aim present clinical trial evaluate potential advantage new Harmonic device ( FOCUS ) , develop especially Thyroid procedure , use HS thyroidectomy compare EC term operative time , number ligature , QoL , blood loss , pain intensity surgical site , amount drainage , complication , include incidence RLN palsy hypoparathyroidism .</detailed_description>
