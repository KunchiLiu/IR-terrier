	<brief_summary>This study measure effect anti-diabetic agent sitagliptin blood pressure individual metabolic syndrome . We also measure effect sitagliptin blood pressure people already take blood pressure medication call ACE inhibitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Sitagliptin ACE Inhibitor Blood Pressure Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence metabolic syndrome Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) reach epidemic proportion develop country closely associated hypertension . As new oral hypoglycemic agent become available clinical use , practitioner wish treat hyperglycemia hypertension use variety combination medication . In set , understand interaction additive effect medication becomes essential . Sitagliptin , selective dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor , improve glycemic control patient T2DM decrease degradation incretin hormone . The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) augment nutrient mediate insulin release . To date two report blood pressure lower effect DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin , mechanism effect propose . Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin lower blood pressure compare placebo therapy subject metabolic syndrome . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin potentiate blood pressure response acute ACE-inhibition .</detailed_description>
