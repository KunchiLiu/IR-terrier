	<brief_summary>Briefly , multisite study design identify endophenotypes ( i.e. , heritable biomarkers ) associate either schizophrenia bipolar disorder alone , together . The subsequent genetic analysis search genomic locus candidate gene associate independent endophenotypes . This five site study slot NIMH funding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bipolar Schizophrenia Consortium Parsing Intermediate Phenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose recruit 100 case probands diagnosis SZ , 100 case probands diagnosis BP Disorder I history psychosis ; BPI-P ) 400 1st degree case relative . All 1st degree family member willing participate provide clinical information blood sample , proportion eligible endophenotypic study ) . Individuals psychotic disorder otherwise specify also eligible test . Their data incorporate schizophrenia bipolar data upon confirmation diagnosis . Family member individual psychotic disorder otherwise specify test unless individual later confirm diagnosis schizophrenia bipolar disorder . Probands test acute phase illness judge clinically e.g. , significant increase core symptom stable baseline require change treatment increase dose medication , drug change , hospitalization ) . As part another exist protocol , collect endophynotypic information schizophrenia probands 1st degree relative brain imaging test . We attempt recruit subject complete image study data use current study . We recruit 100 healthy comparison subject community order describe distribution normal value endophenotype procedure demographically match sample . The SZ BPI-P probands , 50 healthy control subject , frequency match age , sex ratio , head household 's socio-economic status ( SES ) . Another group 50 healthy control subject similarly match relative group recruit . Participants undergo number clinical , electrophysiological , structural brain imaging , perceptual , cognitive assessment . These data use identify phenotype likely associate genetic risk schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder , determine phenotype aggregate family . Some analysis focus examine association candidate gene alternative phenotype . Thus able recruit relative may still collect phenotypic data probands genetic sample future genotype/phenotype association study . Family member may elect participate clinical blood draw portion study . Testing procedure require 12 -15 hour time commitment test complete 2 day . Participants ask give blood ( saliva difficult obtain blood sample instance fear blood draw ) , stored future genetic analysis . Data previous family study combine data collect protocol analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female participant 15 year age . Case probands include individual meet DSMIV criterion schizophrenia , schizoaffective , bipolar disorder psychosis Control subject meet DSMIV criterion lifetime psychotic illness BP , family history psychotic BP disorder first seconddegree relative exclude . A number exclusion necessary potentially affect neurophysiological measure . Exclusions apply group maintain consistency recruitment . As result , follow individual exclude : Subjects 15 year age exclude . Subjects serious medical , neuroophthalmological neurological illness ( e.g. , cancer , seizure disorder , encephalopathy ) exclude , exception family member subject participate clinical interview blood sample . Subjects current substance abuse ( within 6 month ) , dependence within 2 year extensive history drug dependence exclude , exception family member subject participate clinical interview blood sample . Subjects mental retardation exclude , exception family member subject participate clinical interview blood sample . Subjects ferromagnetic object lodge body exclude , exception family member subject participate clinical interview blood sample . Schizophrenic patient judge incompetent provide voluntary inform consent base ESC evaluation . Any participant would require xray rule presence metal body prior MRI scan</criteria>
