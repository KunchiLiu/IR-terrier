	<brief_title>Clevidipine Treatment Patients With Acute Hypertension Intracerebral Hemorrhage ( ACCELERATE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , single-arm , non-blinded dose titration efficacy safety trial evaluate ability clevidipine , vascular-selective L-type calcium channel antagonist , rapidly control acute hypertension patient intracerebral hemorrhage . Informed consent obtain patient meet inclusion criterion initiation study-specific procedure . At screening , clinical neurological examination carry . For purpose study , acute hypertension define SBP &gt; 160 mmHg immediately prior initiation study drug . Approximately 30 40 patient acute intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) plan enrol approximately 10 patient require monitor intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . Infusion study drug initiate within 12 hour ICH symptom onset . All eligible patient enrol received clevidipine open label manner . Clevidipine infused initial rate 2.0 mg/h first 1.5 minute . Thereafter , titration high infusion rate attempt need , obtain target SBP range ( SBP ≤160 mmHg ≥140 mmHg ) . Titration effect proceed double dose every 1.5 minute , maximum 32.0 mg/h , desire effect ( SBP within target range ) attain . During first 30 minute , desire blood pressure lower effect attain maintain , alternative intravenous ( IV ) antihypertensive agent ( ) , advise different class calcium channel blocker , could use without stop clevidipine infusion . The clevidipine infusion could continue maximum 96 hour . Twenty-four hour follow-up computerized tomography ( CT ) scan result record , include measurement intracerebral hematoma volume . Assessment safety perform throughout treatment period 6 hour termination study drug . Patients follow 7 day follow termination clevidipine infusion .</detailed_description>
