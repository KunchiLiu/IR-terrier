	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Examine Sleep Fatigue Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients Hospitalized High Dose Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study determine patient randomize hospital sleep environment intervention would improve sleep quality reduce fatigue compare patient receive intervention ( standard care ) . All patient enrol SJMB03 admit receive either 2nd 3rd course chemotherapy eligible study . The patient admit four six day participant wear actigraph collect information 8 sleep quality indicator six day . In addition , fatigue measurement also collect compare two group . Given nature intervention , difficult follow traditional randomization scheme randomize eligible patient intervention standard care high likelihood design contamination secondary interaction among family member among nurses regard different care study participant two study group . Therefore , study use group randomize trial design patient randomized month . That , patient admit month randomize intervention month receive intervention patient admit standard care month receive intervention . This type randomization plan notable strength match study design also two potential challenge : 1 ) patient randomize within last five day month continue receive assign treatment randomize although treatment assignment continue different month could randomize different condition previous month , 2 ) random assignment month two treatment arm , possibility unequal distribution patient randomize two group .</detailed_description>
