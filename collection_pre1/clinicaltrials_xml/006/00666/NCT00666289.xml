	<brief_summary>Myeloproliferative disorder occur family , thus give rise theory genetic disease may cause abnormal gene DNA pass one generation family member another . DNA gather family member blood sample investigator investigate ( DNA test ) see abnormal gene may responsible cause MPDs . Understanding gene responsible cause MPDs help develop way identify people may risk develop MPD , allow development better treatment , possibly cure , even prevent development MPDs .</brief_summary>
