	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A stop-smoking plan include health education counsel bupropion may help African-American smoker stop smoking . It yet know whether health education counsel effective without bupropion help African Americans stop smoking . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study health education counsel bupropion see well work compare placebo health education counsel help African Americans smoker stop smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Education Counseling With Without Bupropion Helping African Americans Stop Smoking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy bupropion hydrochloride health education counsel vs placebo health education counsel smoke cessation among African Americans light smoker . Secondary - To characterize CYP2A6 activity African Americans light smoker evaluate phenotype ( 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio [ 3HC/COT ] ) CYP2A6 genotype . - To evaluate relationship CYP2A6 activity smoke cessation outcome . - To evaluate CYP2A6 genetic polymorphism associate nicotine cotinine metabolism African Americans light smoker . - To measure baseline cotinine metabolite level evaluate nicotine metabolism phenotype 3HC/COT . - To evaluate relationship nicotine metabolism phenotype 3HC/COT smoking cessation outcomes . - To evaluate CYP2A6 genotype predictor smoke cessation outcome . Tertiary - To characterize CYP2B6 activity African Americans light smoker evaluate phenotype CYP2B6 genotype . - To evaluate relationship CYP2B6 activity smoke cessation outcome . - To measure steady state bupropion hydrochloride metabolite level identify bupropion metabolism phenotype . - To evaluate relationship bupropion hydrochloride metabolism phenotype smoke cessation outcome . - To evaluate relationship CYP2B6 genetic polymorphism ( genotype ) blood level bupropion hydrochloride active metabolite ( phenotype ) . - To determine effect CYP2B6 genotype predictor smoke cessation outcome . OUTLINE : Participants randomize one two arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral bupropion hydrochloride twice daily week 0-6 . Participants also undergo 6 session health education counsel conduct person clinic visit week 0 , 3 , 7 via telephone week 1 , 5 , 16 . The health education counsel session include provide information risk continue smoke benefit quit , develop quit plan , outline concrete quit day preparation plan , discuss strategy successful quitting , build social support , reduce stress , recognize manage withdrawal craving , overcome barrier abstinence , use medication smoking cessation .

Participants also undergo health education counsel arm I . Participants complete baseline questionnaire demographic , smoke history , psychometrics , include follow : racial identity , depressive symptom , alcohol use , stress , smoking consequence , social support , environmental influence smoking , adherence study medication , nicotine withdrawal , crave , mood . Participants undergo serum sample collection week 0 3 . To standardize time since last cigarette , participant ask smoke one cigarette prior serum sample collection week 0 . Samples analyze nicotine metabolism phenotype bupropion hydrochloride metabolism phenotype liquid chromatography mass spectrometry CYP2A6 CYP2B6 genotype polymerase chain reaction polymorphism analysis . Participants self-report abstinence also undergo saliva sample collection week 7 26 measure cotinine level verify smoke status . After completion study intervention , participant follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
