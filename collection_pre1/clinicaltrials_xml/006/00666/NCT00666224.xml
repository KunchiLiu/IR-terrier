	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass effect treatment glatiramer acetate ( GA ) compare placebo time conversion CDMS , determine Poser criterion ( occurrence second clinical attack ) double-blind period . The secondary objective ass , within time frame 3-year double-blind , placebo-controlled study period , effect GA clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) parameter . The long-term objective study ( exploratory nature ) ass , within time frame 5 year , neuroprotective effect early versus delay treatment GA reflect clinical MRI parameter measure accumulate irreversible brain tissue damage . A pre-planned interim analysis perform efficacy safety data accumulate database October 14 , 2007 , i.e . 81 % exposure treatment double-blind , placebo-controlled period collect . Upon review interim analysis result , Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) recommend double-blind portion study stop subject switch 2-year Open-label period , time would option receive GA therapy . The sponsor ( Teva ) adopt DMC recommendation take necessary action towards implementation .</brief_summary>
