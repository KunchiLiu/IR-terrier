	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Registry Participants With Breast Cancer Characteristics Hereditary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To develop web-based Breast Cancer Collaborative Registry ( BCCR ) repository socio-demographic , environmental , clinical history , family history , biospecimen data collect National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) center participant personal history breast cancer and/or characteristic hereditary breast cancer . - To merge data already collect breast cancer patient Adult Oncology Data Collection Study newly diagnose breast cancer patient participate NCCN Data Coordinating study UNMC/NMC . - To standardize clinical , environmental , socio-demographic , family history data breast cancer-related information collect share research purpose Eppley Breast Cancer Research Group breast cancer research collaborator . - To collect , validate , disseminate breast cancer-related data establish high-risk cohort future research molecular biological base breast cancer susceptibility interventional trial . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Study participant undergo data collection relate breast cancer study one National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) center inclusion Breast Cancer Collaborative Registry ( BCCR ) . The BCCR comprehensive computerized database serve repository socio-demographic , environmental , clinical history , family history , biospecimen data collect breast cancer patient treat UNMC protocol . Central feature registry include standardized data-entry form relational database use resource study pathology , immunology , cytogenetics , molecular biology , epidemiology , clinical feature , outcome patient benign , pre-malignant , malignant breast disease . Study participant complete self-administered electronic paper-based survey medical history questionnaire baseline provide information demographic ( e.g. , age sex ) ; personal family medical history ; treatment history ; lifestyle , physical activity , dietary habit ; quality life ; environmental exposure history ; family tree inclusion registry . Participants also undergo telephone in-person structure interview conduct study coordinator , genetic counselor , System Coordinator BCCR provide additional information clarification information provide questionnaire . Study participant also undergo review medical record pathology report obtain detailed medical treatment-related information inclusion registry . The information collect include retrospective prospective disease-specific data ( e.g. , diagnosis , grade/stage , laboratory value ) longitudinal outcome data ( e.g. , response treatment , toxicity , survival , relapse ) derive prospective clinical follow-up . Study participant follow periodically update relevant health family history .</detailed_description>
