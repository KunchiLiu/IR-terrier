We recently show sober alcoholic decrease dysphoric response NMDA antagonist , ketamine . We propose test hypothesis characteristic exists vulnerability factor individual susceptible develop alcoholism . Specifically , objective determine whether individual family history positive ( FHP ) alcoholism experience less dysphoric , anxiogenic , psychotogenic effect alcohol infusion compare family history negative ( FHN ) control subject . Male female subject , FHP ( biological father one first degree relative ) age 21-30 , matched control ( FHN ) complete 3 test day randomize balanced order double-blind condition . Test day involve administration placebo one two ethanol dos ( target BrAc=40mg % , target BrAc=100mg % ) intravenously 20 minute , target BrAc achieve . Once BrAc achieve ( 40mg % 100mg % ) maintain use clamp procedure 60 minute . Outcome measure include Positive Negative Symptom Scale , visual analog scale mood state , ( i.e . anxiety ) Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) measure perceptual response alcohol . Secondary measure include visual analog scale high , similarity ethanol , Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) , Placement electrodes , Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale , Hopkins Verbal Learning , number drink scale , aspects crave alcohol test cognitive impairment .</detailed_description>
