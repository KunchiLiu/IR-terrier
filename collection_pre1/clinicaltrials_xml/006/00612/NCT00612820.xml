Approximately 60 subject select enrolment intention acquire least 48 evaluable subject . Laboratory safety assessment , 12-lead electrocardiograph ( ECG ) , vital sign adverse event enquiry make throughout study . Nasal examination , symptom score , nasal lavage , nasal scrape allergen challenge assessment also perform various time point throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject healthy . Healthy subject define individual free clinically significant illness disease determine medical history ( include family ) , physical examination , laboratory study , test . They age 18 50 year inclusive . Body mass index less 29.0 kg/m² weight range 55.0kg ( female 50kg ) 95.0kg inclusive . They history seasonal allergic rhinitis . They exhibit moderate response 1500 grass pollen grains/m3 2h Vienna Challenge Chamber , define nasal symptom score least 6 . ( Nasal symptom score sum obstruction , rhinorrhoea , itch sneeze , score scale 0 3 ) . They positive skin prick test ( wheal ³ 4mm ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They positive RAST ( ³ class 2 ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They current nonsmoker use tobacco product 6 month precede screen visit pack history £ 10 pack year . Pack year = No cigarette smoked/day They must baseline FEV1 &gt; 80 % predict baseline FEV1 ( maximum record value ) /FVC ( maximum record value ) &gt; 70 % predict ( use Standardized Lung Function Testing guideline produce European Community Coal Steel ) . There condition factor would make subject unlikely able stay chamber 4 hour . They capable give informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . They available complete study measurement . Pregnant nursing female . Women childbearing potential unwilling unable use appropriate method contraception , outline , least two week prior first dose study medication ; continue final pregnancy test perform . On examination subject find structural nasal abnormality nasal polyposis , history frequent nosebleed , recent nasal surgery recent ( within 2weeks ) ongoing upper respiratory tract infection Responsible Physician 's opinion render subject unsuitable participation study . Any respiratory disease mild stable asthma control occasional use asneeded shortacting betaagonists associate normal lung function . The subject likely unable abstain salbutamol use 8 hour challenge . The subject history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . The subject concurrently participate another clinical study participate study investigational product ( new chemical entity ) previous 4 month clinical study previous month . The subject screening QTc ( B ) value &gt; 450msec , PQ interval outside range 120 240msec ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination Twave ) . In addition subject exclude history atrial ventricular arrhythmia . A supine blood pressure persistently high 140/90 millimetre mercury ( mmHg ) screening . A supine mean heart rate outside range 4090 beat per minute ( bpm ) screening . The subject donate unit blood ( 450mL ) within previous 3 month intend donate within 3 month complete study . The subject currently take regular ( course ) medication whether prescribed , include steroid , vitamin , herbal remedy ( e.g . St. John 's Wort ) . Subjects permitted take potent inhibitor cytochrome P450 3A4 include macrolide antibiotic azole antifungal due potential increase systemic exposure fluticasone propionate . Paracetamol ( £2g/day ) occasional need use shortacting beta agonist permit . The subject use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( ever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator Sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . The subject use oral , injectable dermal steroid within 5 week intranasal and/or inhaled steroid within 1 week screen visit . Past present disease , judge investigator , may affect outcome study . These disease include , limited , cardiovascular disease , malignancy , hepatic disease , renal disease* , haematological disease , neurological disease , endocrine disease pulmonary disease ( include confine chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis pulmonary fibrosis ) . *subjects require normal serum creatinine clearance value screen [ calculate serum creatinine predict equation use CockcroftGualt formula ] . If creatinine clearance value great upper limit normal determine local laboratory reference range , Investigator determine whether clinically significant find would preclude participation . The subject regularly drink 28 unit alcohol week male , 21 unit per week female . One unit alcohol define medium ( 125 ml ) glass wine , half pint ( 250 ml ) beer one measure ( 24 ml ) spirit . The subject risk noncompliance study procedures/restrictions . The subject infect Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , HIV . The subject elevate Troponin T normal range . The subject elevate CKMB normal range . Contraception females Appropriate contraceptive method female subject include : • Abstinence . The lifestyle female complete abstinence intercourse two week prior first dose study medication continue follow visit . One follow method acceptable sole method contraception indisputable data &gt; 99 % effective otherwise use barrier method ( condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) use spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) : Documented tubal ligation Documented placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository .</criteria>
