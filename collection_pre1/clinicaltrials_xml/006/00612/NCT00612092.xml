	<brief_summary>The objective study compare radiation dose standard spiral scan new sequential scan protocol . We hypothesize sequential scan protocol associate reduction dose estimate least 20 % , diagnostic image quality inferior . Secondary endpoint study include quantitative image quality parameter , diagnostic accuracy spiral versus sequential study compare invasive angiography patient underwent subsequent invasive coronary angiography .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient schedule coronary CT scan screen inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients include stable sinus rhythm ( heart rate &lt; 75 bpm dual source CT &lt; 65 bpm 64-slice CT ) . Informed signed consent obtain patient CT scan prepare . After topogram scan native scan Ca-Scoring , patient randomize two group use sealed envelope . After contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography perform standard spiral protocol sequential protocol . The CT examination evaluate two experienced investigator per-vessel basis result study-related data collect dedicated database . For assessment image quality , previously establish 4-point score system use quantitative image quality parameter measure . A 30 day follow-up CT examination aim evaluate patient underwent invasive coronary angiography schedule myocardial stress / perfusion test ( stress-echocardiography , myocardial scintigraphy stress perfusion image MRI ) .</detailed_description>
