	<detailed_description>Central line associate bloodstream infection ( CL-ABI ) important preventable cause nosocomial infection responsible considerable morbidity mortality . It estimate 5 26 % patient experience infectious complication central venous catheter [ 1 ] . In United States , estimate nearly 50,000 patient develop central line associate bloodstream infection ICUs annually , rate approximately 5 infection per 1000 catheter day [ 2 ] many 15,000 death annually . Central line associate bloodstream infection also associate increase hospital ICU length stay ICU ( 2 ) . Estimates cost CL-ABI hospital range $ 25,000 $ 65,000 per patient [ 3 , 4 ] . The Centers Disease Control publish guideline prevention CL-ABI represent collaborative effort multidisciplinary coalition professional organization provide evidence base recommendation prevent catheter relate infection [ 5 ] . The intervention emphasize five distinct practice , include : education training healthcare provider place care catheter , utilize maximum sterile barrier precaution catheter placement , skin preparation use 2 % chlorhexidine , avoid routine replacement central line strategy reduce infection , use antiseptic antibiotic coat line event infection rate remain high despite adherence measure [ 5 ] . Several study demonstrate impressive reduction CL-ABI application strategy , range 18 100 % reduction realize significant reduction mortality cost [ 2 ] . The simple introduction maximum sterile barrier precaution insert central line observe dramatically reduce infection rate decade [ 6 ] . However , CDC 's guideline , despite seem simplicity , find frequently insufficiently apply , whether ignorance omission ( 2 ) In past 12 month total 24 documented central venous catheter ( CVC ) infection SLRHC . At RH total number central line day since June 2005 was3,567 cumulative rate infection 2.8 per 1000 central line day SLH total 8,524 central line day infection rate 4.3 per 1000 central line day . These infection rate figure benchmark experience . The cost CVC infection hospital United States estimate $ 45,000 per infection ( 7 ) . For SLRHC cost incur past 12 month estimate $ 1,080,000 . Training education healthcare personnel utilization maximum sterile precaution two important area . Residents still frequently learn central line placement technique `` see one , one , teach one '' method , definition allows multitude technique practice . While teach theoretically include utilization maximal sterile precaution central line placement , focus teaching , resident ' anxiety , often focused proper placement line , sterile technique use place . Residents non-surgical field may comfortable maximum sterile technique bedside procedure , surgical resident may somewhat blas√© need detail . Medical simulator allow resident practice skill realistic interactive environment minimizes risk patient . Studies find simulation effective mean teach skill diverse ACLS airway management laparoscopic surgical skill ( 8 , 9 , 10 ) . Additionally , use audio-visual equipment medical simulator record resident 's performance give valuable firsthand feedback otherwise available , allow resident visualize misstep ( 11 ) . This hypothesize particular value proper acquisition physical skill maximum sterile precaution . We plan examine utility medical simulation environment replicates ICU set first assess medical resident ' ability utilize maintain maximum sterile precaution placement central venous line use standardized score tool subsequently , assess impact videotape training vs. individual simulate debrief performance correct MBP . We hypothesize medical resident , baseline training placement central venous line , show improvement follow simulation view training videotape , great improvement see resident go debrief simulated method . We hypothesize PGY 2 3 medical resident undergo simulation-based training maximal barrier precaution technique central venous catheter ( CVC ) placement good recall 3 month</detailed_description>
