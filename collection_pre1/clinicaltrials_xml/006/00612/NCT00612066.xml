	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Rosiglitazone may help pituitary tumor cell become like normal cell , grow spread slowly . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well rosiglitazone work treat patient newly diagnose ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor ( Cushing disease ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed ACTH-Secreting Pituitary Tumor ( Cushing Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess effect rosiglitazone biochemical control patient newly diagnose ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor ( Cushing disease ) . Secondary - To assess effect drug corticotrophin ( CRH ) -stimulated pituitary tumor ACTH secretion . - To assess overall safety tolerability drug patient . - To assess overall quality life patient treated drug . - Percentage Reduction 24-hour Urinary-free Cortisol Levels OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral rosiglitazone daily 7 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood , urine , saliva sample collect periodically laboratory study . Inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] , serum sialic acid , soluble intracellular vascular adhesion molecule [ sICAM-1 , sVCAM-1 ] , amyloid A ) measure baseline completion study treatment ; salivary cortisol 24-hour urinary-free cortisol level measure baseline weekly study treatment ; dexamethasone suppression test serum cortisol corticotrophin ( CRH ) stimulation test perform baseline completion study treatment ; prolactin , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF1 ) , thyroid function , sex steroid hormone measure baseline completion study treatment ; dynamic pituitary function test ( arginine/growth hormone-releasing hormone [ GHRH ] test measure growth hormone secretion ) perform baseline .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Clinically demonstrable ACTHsecreting pituitary tumor Pituitary tumor demonstrate MRI without contrast AND/OR evidence central ACTH source follow inferior petrosal sinus sample Newly diagnose disease Biochemically active disease adequately control , demonstrate follow standard criterion : Elevated 24hour urinaryfree cortisol level least 2 separate 24hour urine collection 1 week apart Lack suppression serum cortisol &lt; 1.8 μg/dL ( 8 ) follow administration 1 mg dexamethasone 11 pm night Measurable plasma ACTH level Patient hypercortisolemic wish receive alternate steroidlowering therapy , ketoconazole and/or metyrapone Patients evidence optic nerve chiasm compression postoperative MRI must normal visual field evaluation Goldman perimetry No visual field abnormality Hypopituitarism* allow , evidence following : Subnormal growth hormone ( GH ) response arginine/growth hormonereleasing hormone ( GHRH ) test ( normal response increase &gt; 4 ng/mL ) Low ageand sexmatched insulinlike growth factor1 ( IGF1 ) level Low thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) level Low free triiodothyronine ( T3 ) free thyroxine ( T4 ) level Low estradiol level Low luteinizing hormone ( LH ) folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal female patient Low testosterone , LH , FSH level male patient NOTE : *Patients diagnose hypopituitarism initiate thyroid hormone replacement therapy prior pituitary surgery part routine care . Other hormone replacement , sex steroid growth hormone , initiate study . PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Not pregnant nursing Fertile patient must use effective contraception ( oral contraception use , must use ≥ 2 month prior , , 1 month completion study therapy ) No clinically significant renal , hematologic , hepatic abnormality No prior concurrent medical condition may interfere conduct study evaluation result , opinion investigator DSMB compliance officer No history immunocompromise , include HIV positivity ELISA western blot No alcohol drug abuse within past 6 month No blood donation ( ≥ 400 mL ) within past 2 month No active malignant disease within past 5 year except basal cell carcinoma carcinoma situ cervix No active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection No severe osteoporosis , define bone mineral density T score &lt; 2.5 standard deviation agematched control No history noncompliance medical regimen Considered reliable Able complete entire study PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : More 3 month since prior rosiglitazone thiazolidinedione No prior concurrent radiotherapy pituitary tumor More 1 month since prior participation clinical investigation involve investigational drug More 30 day since prior unlicensed drug No concurrent pituitary surgery</criteria>
