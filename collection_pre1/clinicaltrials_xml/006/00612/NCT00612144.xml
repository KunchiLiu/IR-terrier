	<brief_title>Study Comparing Efficacy Safety Amaryl M Metformin Uptitraion Type 2 DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment algorithms type 2 DM generally employ monotherapy first-line pharmacologic treatment option . Disease progression render monotherapy less effective control blood glucose time , approximately half patient require additional therapy 3 year diagnosis . As result , use multiple pharmacologic agent control blood glucose well accept . In combination therapy , selection suitable drug may individualize depend health condition . However , advisable select drug different mechanism consider complimentary action . Therefore , sulfonylureas metformin HCL best combination `` insulin deficiency '' `` insulin resistance '' , basic two pathophysiologies type 2 diabetes could target . The efficacy safety combination sulfonylurea metformin HCL proven numerous clinical study combination effective monotherapy use drug blood glucose control . Also , new approach require order attain maintain good glycaemic control time aggressive early introduction combination therapy increasingly recommend conventional stepwise strategy .</detailed_description>
