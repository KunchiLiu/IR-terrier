	<brief_summary>Obesity grow public health concern , approximately 31 % Americans consider obese . The link abdominal obesity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) well establish , effect distinct type abdominal fat tissue CVD risk well know . The rate obesity distribution abdominal fat differ age , sex , ethnicity . These difference may important implication determine ethnic-specific relationship abdominal body composition ( ABC ) , inflammation , CVD event . This study evaluate association measure abdominal fat , CVD risk , inflammation term ethnicity- , sex- , age-specific difference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal obesity serious condition increase risk potentially life-threatening cardiovascular disease ( CVDs ) . Abdominal fat make structurally functionally different tissue , include visceral fat , subcutaneous fat , intramuscular fat . The distribution level fat tissue highly variable among obese people , effect ABC differences cardiovascular health well know . Notably , standard measure body mass index distinguish different kind ratio tissue type make body weight , therefore , may best measurement tool . Determining specific measure tissue type compute tomography ( CT ) may provide good insight vary CVD risk see among different ethnicity , sex , age . This study evaluate association volumetric measure ABC , CVD risk , inflammation term ethnicity- , sex- , age-specific variable . This substudy use data specimen , include blood sample CT scan , participant Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) abdominal aortic calcium ( AAC ) . Stored blood sample use perform assay several measure inflammation generate new data biomarkers subclinical CVD measure . The exist CT scan use calculate five discrete volumetric measure ABC , include subcutaneous fat , visceral fat , intramuscular fat , visceral fat visceral cavity ratio , lean muscle visceral fat ratio .
