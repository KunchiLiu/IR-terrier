	<brief_summary>The propose study plan examine effect flaxseed consumption , phytoestrogen rich food , compare aromatase inhibitor complementary approach treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer , well effect combine flaxseed aromatase inhibitor therapy breast cancer treatment . Because increase use complementary alternative approach treatment , use aromatase inhibitor treatment breast cancer , propose study potential provide important clinical information effect food high phytoestrogens common endocrine therapy use breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flaxseed , Aromatase Inhibitors Breast Tumor Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although 10 year survival rate woman early stage breast cancer good , distant recurrence still serious concern , especially estrogen receptor positive woman . Consequently , breast cancer survivor interested therapy might improve recurrence free survival ( RFS ) . Used postmenopausal woman , aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) block peripheral conversion androgen estrogen , effectively lower estradiol available promote breast tumor proliferation . However , use AIs associate hot flash , joint pain , bone loss , increase cardiac event . Furthermore , many breast tumor eventually develop resistance hormonal treatment . Complementary alternative medicine ( CAMs ) widely use cancer survivor attempt reduce disease recurrence few side effect potential health benefit , use particularly prevalent among breast cancer survivor . Flaxseed ( FS ) commonly available food often consume dietary supplement rich food source lignans , phytoestrogen . In experimental model , flaxseed consumption show exhibit number activity suggest potential benefit flaxseed adjuvant setting . However , majority human study investigate biologic effect flaxseed involve healthy woman . There paucity clinical data regard efficacy safety use flaxseed among woman breast cancer , especially among receive AIs . Because phytoestrogens flaxseed influence many biologic pathway affect hormonal agent , diet-drug interaction possible . Additionally , possible flaxseed could act growth signal pathway , modify development endocrine resistance . Potential synergistic antagonistic effect flaxseed antiestrogens particular interest give increase use AIs treat postmenopausal woman hormone responsive disease . We propose conduct pilot 2x2 factorial randomize intervention study tumor biopsy resection , postmenopausal woman diagnose ER positive breast cancer , assess effect flaxseed AI number steroid hormone tumor-related characteristic associate long-term survival , investigate potential interaction flaxseed AI tumor expression Ki-67 , caspase , ERα , ERβ , PgR , HER2 , IGF1 , IGFIR . The pre-surgical setting offer unique opportunity rapidly obtain information intervention relate effect growth factor signal pathway relate tumor characteristic short time period without interference treatment . We hypothesize flaxseed AI intervention independently favorably affect growth factor signal pathway protein expression result reduced tumor proliferation increase apoptosis . We hypothesize improvement reflect improved recurrence score estimate Mammostrat antibody panel ( Applied Genomics Incorporated ) . The propose study provide important clinical data future dietary intervention study involve phytoestrogen lignans flaxseed .</detailed_description>
