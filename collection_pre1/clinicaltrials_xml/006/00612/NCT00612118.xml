	<criteria>The subject healthy . Healthy subject define individual free clinically significant illness disease determine medical history ( include family ) , physical examination , laboratory study , test . Male female 18 50 year inclusive . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception end study . Body mass index less 29.0 kg/m² weight range 55.0kg ( female 50kg ) 95.0kg inclusive . The subject history seasonal allergic rhinitis . The subject exhibit moderate response 1500 grass pollen grains/m3 2 hour Vienna Challenge Chamber , define nasal symptom score least 6 . ( Nasal symptom score sum obstruction , rhinorrhoea , itch sneeze , score scale 0 3 ) . The subject positive skin prick test ( wheal ³ 4mm ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . The subject positive RAST ( ³ class 2 ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . The subject current nonsmoker use tobacco product 6 month precede screen visit pack history £ 10 pack year . The subject must baseline FEV1 &gt; 80 % predict baseline FEV1 ( maximum record value ) /FVC ( maximum record value ) &gt; 70 % predict ( use Standardized Lung Function Testing guideline produce European Community Coal Steel ) There condition factor would make subject unlikely able stay chamber 4 hour . The subject capable give informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form The subject available complete study measurement . Pregnant nursing female Women childbearing potential unwilling unable use appropriate method contraception , list Section 8.1 , least two week prior first dose study medication ; continue end study . On examination subject find structural nasal abnormality nasal polyposis , history frequent nosebleed , recent nasal surgery recent ( within 3 week ) ongoing upper respiratory tract infection Responsible Physician 's opinion render subject unsuitable participation study Any respiratory disease mild stable asthma control occasional use asneeded shortacting betaagonists associate normal lung function . The subject likely unable abstain salbutamol use 8 hour challenge The subject history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . The subject concurrently participate another clinical study participate study investigational product ( new chemical entity ) previous 4 month clinical study previous month . The subject screening QTc ( B ) value &gt; 450msec , PQ interval outside range 120 240msec ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination Twave ) . In addition subject exclude history atrial ventricular arrhythmia . A supine blood pressure persistently high 140/90 millimetre mercury ( mmHg ) screening . A supine mean heart rate outside range 4090 beat per minute ( bpm ) screening . The subject donate unit blood ( 450mL ) within previous 3 month intend donate within 3 month complete study . The subject currently take regular ( course ) medication whether prescribed , include steroid , vitamin , macrolides , antifungal agent herbal remedy ( e.g . St. John 's Wort ) . Paracetamol ( £2g/day ) occasional need use shortacting beta agonist permit . The subject use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St. John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potent enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( ever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator Sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . The subject use oral , injectable dermal steroid within 5 week intranasal and/or inhaled steroid within 1 week screen visit . Past present disease , judge investigator , may affect outcome study . These disease include , limited , cardiovascular disease , malignancy , hepatic disease , renal disease* , haematological disease , neurological disease , endocrine disease pulmonary disease ( include confine chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis pulmonary fibrosis ) . *subjects require normal serum creatinine clearance value screen [ calculate serum creatinine predict equation use CockcroftGualt formula ] . If creatinine clearance value great upper limit normal determine local laboratory reference range , Investigator determine whether clinically significant find would preclude participation . The subject regularly drink 28 unit alcohol week male , 21 unit per week female . One unit alcohol define medium ( 125 ml ) glass wine , half pint ( 250 ml ) beer one measure ( 24 ml ) spirit . The subject risk noncompliance study procedures/restrictions . The subject infect Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , HIV virus . The subject elevate Troponin T normal range . The subject , deem Investigator clinically significant CKMB value normal range .</criteria>
