	<brief_summary>The Phase I safety study complete . FDA approval grant proceed Phase II . The primary objective Phase II study ass safety effectiveness Anaconda Stent Graft System subject present abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . The secondary objective study assess additional clinical outcome measurement associate treatment AAA use Anaconda Stent Graft System</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm afflict large number patient United States world-wide . The treatment disorder base upon concept aneurysm repair prior presentation symptom rupture . Thus aneurysm repair view prophylactic procedure embark upon prevent disastrous complication rupture aneurysm . The decision treat aneurysm electively base upon risk benefit ratio . Treatment option include medical management co-morbidities ( hypertension , pulmonary disease , etc . ) observation aneurysm , open surgical aneurysm repair transabdominal retroperitoneal approach , endovascular aneurysm repair . The decision intervene base upon physician judgment . Once decision intervene make , mode intervention must choose . Although open surgical repair invasive note high morbidity mortality ( 1 ; 2 ) endovascular report , argue effectiveness procedure . To date , open surgical repair remain gold standard care aneurysm patient . Endovascular repair several beneficial characteristic comparison open surgical approach . They include potential decreased need blood transfusion , shorter intensive care unit total hospital stay , lack endotracheal intubation , name . However , procedure require adequate image prior graft placement follow-up period , addition availability train team ensure proper device placement .</detailed_description>
