	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To find chemotherapy treatment use Pemetrexed ( Alimta ) Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) give together kill cancer cell patient 's body shrink size tumor . This may allow patient live long decrease frequency and/or severity symptom cause cancer . Pemetrexed approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat Lung Cancer . Oxaliplatin approve FDA treatment Colon Cancer . The combination two drug use treat patient Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Italy yet USA Other purpose study : - To good detail toxic effect chemotherapy combination . - To determine whether level specific gene and/or gene product ( gene genetic material allow cell make protein enzyme ) useful predict chemotherapy combination work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed &amp; Oxaliplatin Patients w Recurrent NSCLCa After Failure Platinum Based Adjuvant Chem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan : This non-randomized , two stage design , open-label Phase II trial newly diagnose patient advance metastatic NSCLC previously receive failed adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy early stage , resect NSCLC . Correlative Studies ; Molecular correlative study ( genomic proteomic ) include protocol . Prior chemotherapy , patient undergo biopsy safe and/or accessible site tumor order obtain tissue mRNA measurement . Additionally , patient undergo blood sample prior start chemotherapy 2 4 cycle therapy order obtain plasma mass spectrometry analysis . Patients , whose second and/or third specimen collect reason , remain trial , treatment continue outline protocol . Expected Number Patients : The number patient calculate accord procedure describe Sample Size Calculation section protocol . It estimate 50 patient enrol obtain 43 evaluable patient need meet statistical design study . Method Treatment Allocation : A patient number assign sequentially patient upon registration . The patient number patient initial enter page Case Report Form . Duration Study Each Patient : All patient treat 6 cycle chemotherapy . However , discretion treat physician principle investigator , patient may continue chemotherapy , beyond 6 cycle , disease progression , intolerable toxicity , development study removal criterion . Patients undergo evaluation extent disease every treatment cycle . Patients consider on-study duration treatment 30 day follow treatment discontinuation . Treatment discontinuation define last day study treatment . All include patient follow recovery stabilization adverse event return baseline condition . Patients discontinue trial prior experience disease progression follow monthly demonstration progressive disease . Study Centers : The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center conduct trial Moffitt Clinical Research Affiliate Network . Patients evaluate biopsy perform H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center . Since chemotherapeutic drug use protocol FDA approve , phase I II safety data regard regimen published30,31 , chemotherapy may administer patient ' primary ( refer ) oncologist ' office . Documentation administration chemotherapy obtain record keep purpose .</detailed_description>
