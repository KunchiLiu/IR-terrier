	<brief_summary>Background : - Melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART ) -1 protein present melanoma cell . - An experimental procedure develop treat patient melanoma use anti-MART-1 F5 gene type virus make special cell call anti-MART-1 F5 cell design destroy patient 's tumor . These cell create laboratory use patient 's tumor cell blood cell . - The treatment procedure also use vaccine call plaque purify canarypox vector ( ALVAC ) MART-1 , make virus ordinarily infect canary modify carry copy MART-1 gene . The virus reproduce mammal , cause disease human . When vaccine inject patient , stimulate cell immune system may increase efficiency anti-MART-1 F5 cell . Objectives : -To evaluate safety effectiveness anti-MART-1 F5 ALVAC vaccine treat patient advanced melanoma . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age metastatic melanoma standard treatment effective . Design : - Patients undergo scan , x-rays test leukapheresis obtain white cell laboratory treatment . - Patients 7 day chemotherapy prepare immune system receive anti-MART-1 F5 . - Patients receive ALVAC vaccine , anti-MART-1 F5 cell interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( approve treatment advanced melanoma ) . The anti-MART-1 F5 cell give infusion vein . The vaccine give injection infusion anti-MART-1 F5 cell 2 week later . IL-2 give 15-minute infusion every 8 hour 5 day cell infusion maximum 15 dos . - After hospital discharge , patient return clinic periodic follow-up physical examination , review treatment side effect , laboratory test scan every 1 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - We engineer human PBLs express anti-MART-1 T-cell receptor recognize human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) 0201 restrict epitope derive tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) clone DMF5 . - We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha infinity chain mediate genetic transfer T cell receptor ( TCR ) high efficiency without need perform selection . - In co-cultures HLA-A 0201 positive melanoma , anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon ( IFN ) - ( significant secretion observe control co-cultures cell line . - The anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) could efficiently kill HLA-A 0201 positive tumor . There little recognition normal fibroblast cell . - This TCR 10 time reactive melanoma cell MART-1 TCR mediate tumor regression two patient metastatic melanoma . - In trial would like test hypothesis addition anti-tumor ALVAC vaccine result clinical tumor regression persistence transfer cell ( case murine model ) . Objectives : Primary objective : -Determine administration anti-MART-1 F5 TCR -engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte , ALVAC anti-tumor immunization , aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . Secondary objective : - Determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A 0201 positive 18 year age old must : - metastatic melanoma ; - previously receive non-responder recurred aldesleukin ; - normal value basic laboratory value . Patients may : - concurrent major medical illness ; - form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; - severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . - Design : - peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10^9 cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10^8 5 X 10^8 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-MART-1 F5 TCR gene . These transduced cell expand tested anti-tumor activity . - Once engineer PBMC demonstrate biologically active accord strict-criteria outlined Certificate Analysis , patient receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . Approximately 2 hour prior cell infusion , patient immunize ALVAC virus express tumor antigen . ALVAC immunization repeat 2 week . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment monthly approximately 3 4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . If 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol . - The objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , ALVAC immunization anti-MART-1 F5 TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 percent ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 percent partial response ( PR ) plus complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
