	<brief_summary>To assess dynamic uptake washout 123-I CLINDE , potential imaging biomarker inflammatory change brain , use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) similarly age healthy control subject Alzheimer ( AD ) Parkinson disease ( PD ) . To perform blood metabolite characterization 123-I CLINDE healthy subject AD PD determine nature metabolites assessment 123-I CLINDE single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) brain imaging agent .

	<detailed_description>When microglia become activated express peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) bind site mitochondrial membrane . PBRs functionally structurally distinct central benzodiazepine receptor associate y-aminiobutric acid ( GABA ) -regulated chloride channel . PBRs find abundance peripheral organ hematologic cell , present low level normal central nervous system ( Banati , 2002 ) . CLINDE phenylimidazopyridine appear bind selectively PBR . In absence excessive blood CNS increase CLINDE bind PBR potential marker microglial activation CNS . The increase CLINDE binding may indicator transition microglia rest activated state . When labeled 123-I use SPECT radiotracer , CLINDE may serve vivo marker microglial activation Alzheimer disease Parkinson disease . The 123-I radioactive tag offer distinct advantage large-scale clinical imaging study anti-inflammatory targeted treatment marker microglial activation efficacy therapeutic intervention . The half-life ( 13.1 h ) 123-I permit image multiple subject single research-dedicated imaging center , multiple research subject per day . This minimize variability introduce multi-center quantitative imaging trial different camera , image processing method , QA procedures conspire increase variance image biomarkers . Using model , group pioneer method evaluate loss dopamine function Parkinson 's disease use radioactive drug 123-I β-CIT bind directly dopamine nerve terminal . The adaptation image agent like 123-I CLINDE biomarker microglial activation neurodegenerative disease require human validation study . Expanding upon previous work b-amyloid ligand ( 123I-IMPY , 123-I MNI-187 ) AD dopamine transporter ligand ( 123-I B-CIT , Altropane ) PD , desire develop characterize 123-I CLINDE potential marker microglial activation association neuronal damage may applicable multiple neurodegenerative disease . Ultimately marker microglial activation could use large-scale quantitative brain imaging trial AD PD , specifically investigate agent objective biomarker treatment aim reduce inflammatory change condition . The significance work lie apply state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tool develop relevant biomarker individual neurodegenerative disease intention use efficiently large clinical imaging trial .</detailed_description>
