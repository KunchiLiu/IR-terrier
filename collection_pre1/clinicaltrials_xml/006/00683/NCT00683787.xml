	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vandetanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether docetaxel effective give together without vandetanib . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study docetaxel see well work compare docetaxel give together vandetanib treat patient metastatic stomach cancer gastroesophageal junction cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without Vandetanib Treating Patients With Metastatic Stomach Cancer Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To test hypothesis addition target agent , vandetanib , standard chemotherapy docetaxel result incremental response patient metastatic gastric gastroesophageal junction cancer . Secondary - To assess progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - To study toxicity profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord clinical site . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV every 3 week . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV arm I oral vandetanib ( 100 mg ) daily . - Arm III : Patients receive docetaxel IV arm I oral vandetanib ( 300 mg ) daily . In arm , course repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
