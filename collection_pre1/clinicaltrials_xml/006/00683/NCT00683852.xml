Additional criterion define response nonresponse patient Phase 2 eligible pool data patient Phase 1 . Among patient prerandomized receive placebo phase receive placebo Phase 1 aripiprazole phase 2 , meet nonresponse criterion add primary efficacy sample : Placebo nonresponders define patient fail achieve 50 % decrease MADRS score visit 3 , Have MADRS score &gt; 16 visit 3 1 .
