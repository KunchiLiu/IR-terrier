	<brief_title>Single Agent Abraxane Second Line Therapy Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient advanced bladder cancer progress platinum base regimen , widely accept standard second line therapy currently exist . Taxanes include paclitaxel exhibit clinical activity disease sometimes give study . However , toxicity include neurotoxicity hypersensitivity reaction often limit use paclitaxel . ABRAXANE may allow delivery great dose paclitaxel bladder cancer easy method administration less toxicity .</detailed_description>
