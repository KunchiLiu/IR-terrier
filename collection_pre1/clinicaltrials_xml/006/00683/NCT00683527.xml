	<brief_title>Timing Iron Supplementation Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smaller preterm infant birth , susceptible iron deficiency due low body iron store . Despite low iron store , low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants usually start iron supplementation till reach postnatal age 6 8 week . Such delayed supplementation lead rapid depletion iron store erythropoiesis becomes active ( 8 week life ) . Depletion iron store first step continuum change occur iron deficiency . Iron deficiency induces biochemical defect ( impaired synthesis DNA collagen ) even feature microcytic , hypochromic anemia become evident . The rapidly maturing preterm brain especially vulnerable effect iron deficiency ; poor school-age performance report among child low iron store neonatal period . Early iron supplementation i.e . start iron infant reach full enteral feed could potentially improve iron store prevent depletion . Surprisingly , study available till date support ( refute ! ) view . The current study design test hypothesis whether early iron supplementation would increase nutritional iron status ( measure serum ferritin ) 60 day life compare exist regime start iron age 2 month .</detailed_description>
