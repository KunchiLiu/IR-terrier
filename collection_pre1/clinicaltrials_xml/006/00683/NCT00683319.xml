PURPOSE : This phase III trial observe young patient ependymoma undergoing standard combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observing Young Patients With Ependymoma Undergoing Standard Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall survival event-free survival infant diagnose ependymoma third birthday . - To determine overall survival event-free survival infant diagnose ependymoma third birthday treat standard chemotherapy comprise vincristine , carboplatin , high-dose methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , cisplatin . Secondary - To investigate reason primary tumor completely resect patient able undergo complete resection tumor . - To continue investigate biological characteristic ependymoma . - To correlate functional imaging study ependymoma biological characteristic tumor . - To provide standard treatment regimen patient residual disease optimal surgery already participate phase II study . - To prospectively document renal function , hearing , neurocognitive late effect completion study treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord extent prior surgical resection presence metastatic disease ( complete resection tumor v metastatic disease diagnosis vs complete resection tumor ) . Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 , 15 , 29 , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , high-dose methotrexate* IV 24 hour day 15 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 29 , cisplatin IV 48 hour day 43 44 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients residual disease completion treatment may receive treatment discretion investigator . NOTE : *Patients initially treat clinical trial CCLG-CNS-2005-03 residual disease receive high-dose methotrexate course 5-7 . Patients undergo observational assessment comprise physical neurological examination ; MRI/ MRS scan head spine ; audiology , renal , endocrine , neurocognitive , quality life evaluation periodically least 5 year completion study treatment .</detailed_description>
