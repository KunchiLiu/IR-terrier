	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Safety Effects MN-221 Subjects Experiencing Acute Exacerbation Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , modify single-blind , placebo-controlled dose escalation , multi-center Emergency Department ( ED ) study . Each subject receive MN-221 placebo administer continuous intravenous infusion addition standardize care treatment acute exacerbation asthma . The study modify single-blind design subject Investigator blind . Upon presentation ED assessment treatment acute exacerbation asthma subject receive standardize care consistent National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guideline . Once subject receive standardized initial treatment regimen assess response treatment ( sign symptom acute asthma exacerbation ) , inform consent participate study obtain , study entry criterion review , 12-lead ECG perform , dyspnea index scale assessment conduct , spirometry perform . If subject 's FEV1 ≤ 55 % predict subject meet study entry criterion subject randomize receive either MN-221 placebo . Throughout screen process subject continue receive appropriate medical care consistent NAEPP guideline treatment acute exacerbation asthma . There three dose group generally twelve subject group . Subjects enrol study receive intravenous infusion MN-221 study drug placebo . Generally six subject randomize receive MN-221 generally six subject randomize receive placebo dose group . The initial dose group randomize receive : - 16 μg/min MN-221 15 minute ( total dose 240 μg ) placebo . Subsequent dose group receive follow propose dos : - 30 μg/min 15 minute ( total dose 450 μg ) placebo , - 16 μg/min 15 minute follow 8 μg/min 105 minute ( total dose 1,080 μg ) placebo . During study treatment period , subject continue receive follow standard treatment assessment subject 's FEV1 reach ≥ 70 % predict : - Assessment subject 's sign symptom ; - Complete dyspnea index scale ; - Supplemental oxygen maintain oxygen saturation measure pulse oximetry ≥ 90 % ; - Albuterol ( 2.5 mg ) via nebulizer give hourly ; NOTE : Albuterol ( 2.5 mg ) via nebulizer may give every 20 minute deem indicated Investigator . - Ipratropium ( 0.5 mg ) via nebulizer may give every hour deem indicated Investigator . - Spirometry complete within 10 minute nebulizer treatment ; follow , - Reassessment sign symptom . If subject improve FEV1 ≥ 70 % predict study treatment period , subject may continue receive treatment include hospital admission discretion Investigator . The study approximately 6.5 hour length ( Hour -1.5 Hour 5 ) subject remain ED . Safety , efficacy PK parameter monitor throughout treatment period . An initial 24-hour post-randomization follow-up visit complete evaluate subject 's health status well safety PK parameter . A second follow-up contact complete telephone seven day post-randomization safety purpose evaluate subject 's health status . A risk/benefit evaluation perform study 's Safety Review Committee dose level . The occurrence clinical sign , symptom , laboratory abnormality , ECG abnormalities suggest toxicity , result efficacy analysis ( FEV1 , dyspnea index scale ) , may result decision modify propose plan dose escalation , repeat dose level , evaluate additional dose ( ) MN-221 .</detailed_description>
