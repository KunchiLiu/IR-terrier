	<brief_title>A Study IMC-A12 Ramucirumab Plus Mitoxantrone Prednisone Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer frequently diagnose cancer men second lead cause cancer-related death men United States . Chemotherapy , either single agent combination , may lead clinical response , pain control , and/or improve quality life . Docetaxel first-line standard therapy AIPC . Mitoxantrone approve 1996 use combination corticosteroid initial chemotherapy pain related advance Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) . Hormonal manipulation docetaxel-based chemotherapy often effective metastatic prostate cancer ; however , disease become refractory intervention majority men . Although mitoxantrone continue significant agent treatment HRPC , exist need efficacious therapy docetaxel-refractory- AIPC . Because potential contribution Insulin Like Growth Factor Receptor ( IGF-IR ) VEGFR-2 mediate pathway prostate cancer pathogenesis , hypothesize biological agent combination mitoxantrone prednisone result clinically meaningful activity AIPC . Therefore , ImClone plan conduct randomize Phase 2 trial ass safety efficacy IMC-A12 IMC-1121B ( ramucirumab ) combination mitoxantrone prednisone participant AIPC .</detailed_description>
