	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation program ( CRP ) proven treatment ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . These program demonstrate improve adherence regular physical activity , healthy diet smoke cessation , well modify risk factor IHD hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , obesity type 2 diabetes . In addition , CRP cost effective result 25 % reduction reoccurrence mortality . Despite known benefit CRP , little 10 % 25 % eligible patient attend program . One main barrier attendance proximity CRP , majority program limit hospital large urban area . However , cardiovascular disease discriminate geography , result geographic inequity care patient live rural , remote small urban/sub-urban centre . Currently CRP specifically design patient rural remote area . The use Internet may present viable alternative . We recently complete pilot study virtual CRP ( vCRP ) demonstrate significant improvement exercise capacity risk factor . This investigation study vCRP group IHD patient access hospital-based CRP . Hypotheses A . Participation 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program result significant improvement exercise capacity compare usual care , patient diagnose IHD . B . Participation 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program result significant improvement exercise capacity one year compare usual care , patient diagnose IHD . Study Population Men woman 18 year identify consecutive in-patients British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre St. Paul 's Hospital Vancouver reside either Northern Interior Coast Garibaldi health area . Patients eligible IHD , Internet access , previous experience cardiac rehabilitation physical limitation exercise . A total 74 patient ( 37 per group ) recruit randomize either usual care , 4 month 'virtual ' cardiac rehabilitation program deliver via Internet . Usual Care Group Patients randomize usual care provide simple guideline safe exercise healthy eat habit , return care primary care physician . Patients return 4 16 month later outcome assessment . There contact study personnel usual care patient duration study , attempt control level patient care . Intervention The vCRP develop mimic hospital-based CRP include online intake form , one-on-one chat session vCRP nurse , dietitian exercise specialist , data collection ( exercise heart rate , blood pressure , glucose- diabetic ) , peer-support group chat session , ask-an-expert chat session , education , progress report online resource . Upon randomization intervention , patient receive access website , heart rate monitor blood pressure monitor train use . The heart rate monitor allow exercise heart rate data store download home computer upload vCRP webserver . The exercise data review weekly . A letter patient 's primary care physician send outline vCRP intervention , treatment algorithm use indicate circumstance vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact regard management . Patients receive one-on-one counselling nurse , dietitian exercise specialist via chat sessions 3 4 week interval . After 4 month intervention , patient discharge care primary care physician . Outcomes Participants assessed baseline , 4 16 month risk factor lifestyle behaviour . The primary outcome change exercise capacity two group baseline 4 month , baseline 16 month . Exercise capacity assess total time symptom-limited exercise stress test .</brief_summary>
