	<brief_summary>Background : One 2010 Impact Goals Emergency Cardiac Care ( ECC ) Committee American Heart Association double survival cardiac arrest . Currently , approximately 60 % adult 50 % paediatric patient regain spontaneous circulation follow cardiac arrest die leave hospital . A key piece `` chain survival '' fifth link ; care patient post-arrest . Although several modality recommend post arrest care , therapeutic hypothermia in-hospital therapy demonstrate randomized clinical trial improve patient outcome cardiac arrest . Despite strong evidence efficacy apparent simplicity intervention , recent survey show hypothermia deliver inconsistently , incompletely , undue delay hospital receive resuscitated patient ; 26 % physician 26 % hospital regularly institute hypothermia protocol . Primary Objective : To design apply knowledge translation program 2005 AHA guideline hypothermia post cardiac arrest enable effective implementation hypothermia 100 % eligible OHCA patient . The integration two robust data collection system , include pre-hospital in-hospital indicator , give complete process care clinical outcome information cardiac arrest patient . Primary Endpoint : proportion eligible hospital cardiac arrest patient cool 32-34Â°C within 6 hour ED arrival . Study Design : This project implement establish research collaborative 43 hospital southern Ontario currently participate Toronto site Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium . A step wedge study design employ , whereby intervention rolled-out sequentially participate hospital number time period sit reach pre-defined benchmark . The multifaceted KT strategy include 1 ) local multidisciplinary champion ED , ICU , Cardiology 2 ) A simple protocol application hypothermia , tailor local need policy ; 3 ) Identification perceive actual barrier knowledge use ; 4 ) Development implementation tool kit 5 ) Providing timely feedback benchmark hypothermia outcome</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Substantial resource spend provide emergency medical service victim out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . The science pre-hospital medicine advance considerably past decade . Specifically , EMS service medical director develop carefully design protocol , intensive training , substantial resource , attempt improve immediate outcome patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . It anticipate approximately 200-400 patient per year Greater Toronto Area successfully resuscitate Emergency Medical Services personnel admit hospital intact circulatory function . Unfortunately , many patient die follow hospital admission , one variety complication initial cardiac arrest . The `` in-hospital attrition rate '' approximately 50 % , result short longer-term organ damage suffer circulatory arrest , well in-hospital complication include pulmonary , neurological , septic , multi-organ dysfunction relate complication . Although guideline specific aspect intensive care therapy critically ill patient develop ( example , ventilation guideline , sepsis prevention therapy guideline , treatment metabolic disorder , etc ) , practical guideline , specifically aim investigation treatment patient resuscitate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , currently exist . Preliminary study ( press ) suggest program comprehensive consistent adherence specific set standard procedure intensive care unit lead substantial improvement survival patient resuscitate cardiac arrest . One recent example study Oslo Norway , show substantial improvement survival discharge follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest set informal guideline adopt participate intensive care unit . There multiple reason lack clearly articulate guideline protocol investigation treatment patient resuscitate follow cardiac arrest however two obvious lack understanding current recommend best practice practical impediment efficient implementation unit . The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ( ROC ) , NIH fund multi-centre effort , seek randomize 10,000 patient select North American site study specific intervention design improve long term survival patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . As part consortium , intensive care unit ROC hospital invite join new best practice initiative entitle `` Strategies Post Arrest Care ICU '' ( SPARC ) . Working 50 hospital across Ontario , objectives SPARC Project plan follow : 1 . To establish network intensive care unit , medical nursing leader participate collaborative program design standardize , monitor , improve care patient resuscitate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . 2 . To develop series standardize protocols process care patient follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , particular emphasis delivery post cardiac arrest mild hypothermia . These protocol base best evidence date focus simplify process require implement recommend intervention . 3 . To conduct pragmatic clinical trial integrate post cardiac arrest protocol versus historical control , study related patient outcome survival hospital discharge . We also look provide comprehensive assessment in-hospital complication , incidence presume myocardial ischemic event cause cardiac arrest , assess cause in-hospital post discharge morbidity mortality one year follow discharge , function presume underlying cause cardiac arrest in-hospital course .</detailed_description>
