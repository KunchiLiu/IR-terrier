	<detailed_description>Objectives : The Veterans Administration ( VA ) embrace use implementation research critical way improve care facilitate adoption proven medical practice . Yet implementation science still remain rudimentary . Challenges exist judge success implementation project . Rather rely solely hard outcome , investigator must also assess effectively intervention put place site . This assessment come via formative evaluation ( FE ) plan . The FE plan contain diverse data element number flier distribute intervention , often intervention advocate speaks participant , content derive team meeting note , theme extract focus group . The diversity data element appear foreign investigator train traditional health service research . The FE plan also lead confusion measure , , integrate various measure unified whole . Complicating matter fact FE often qualitative -- interview , focus group , meet note make data difficult investigator interpret . Thus , press need provide clarity FE use implementation study . This Short Term Project proposal offer three-part approach toward specify best FE practice : first , systematic review literature ; second , qualitative interview VA implementation investigator ; third , panel discussion national expert , fund VA Implementation Collaborative Award . The panel discussion outline FE guideline base researcher expertise , systematic review , qualitative interview . The specific aim proposal include follow : Specific Aim 1 : Conduct systematic review VA fund implementation project classify specific type FE procedures employ . Specific Aim 2 : Conduct in-depth telephone interview investigator VA-funded implementation project establish FE method use consider most/least successful . Specific Aim 3 : Using national expert gather together umbrella Center Health Equity Research Promotions ( CHERP ) Implementation Research Collaborative , develop set guideline outline best FE practice VA implementation research . Relevance VA , Anticipated Results , Future Directions : This Short Term Project design provide rapid result develop best approach toward use FE VA implementation science . As proposal responsive VA Health Services Research &amp; Development ( HSR &amp; D ) priority topic implementation management research methodology . The systematic review , qualitative report , FE guideline emerge project wide-spread application within VA implementation community , thereby support HSR &amp; D research mission . The study also serve need pilot data future Merit Review award application design provide theoretical practical approach toward FE use within VA .</detailed_description>
