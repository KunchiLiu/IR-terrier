	<brief_summary>Protein-rich diet appear show benefit promote weight loss . It think increase intake leucine may account effect . This study design ass whether beneficial effect dietary leucine supplementation observe mouse also apply human . Specifically , team would like determine whether oral leucine supplementation overweight/obese human increase metabolic rate , reduce body weight , improve glucose utilization and/or , reduce circulate fat level blood . We hope result obtain pilot study highlight specific aspect metabolic improvement associate increase daily leucine intake . This study provide data use design definitive trial regard dietary leucine supplementation . Hypothesis This pilot study design accomplish follow two goal : 1. ass whether beneficial effect dietary leucine supplementation observe mouse also apply human . Specifically , want determine whether oral leucine supplementation overweight/obese individual ' increase basal metabolic rate , reduce body weight , improve glucose tolerance and/or insulin sensitivity , and/or reduces circulate Low-density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol level . 2 . To provide data use design definitive trial regard dietary leucine supplementation . We hope result obtain pilot study highlight specific aspect metabolic improvement associate increase daily leucine intake . This would turn lead rigorous clinical trial involve large sample size , diverse population different gender , age , ethnic group . Future trial may also direct determine minimal dos duration leucine supplementation capable achieve clinically significant improvement cardio-metabolic risk profile people .</brief_summary>
