	<brief_title>A Study 131I-TM601 Adults With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open label , non-randomized , Phase 1/2 study evaluate use multiple intravenous dos 131I-TM601 patient progressive and/or recurrent malignant glioma . The study conduct two phase . Prior initiate treatment part study , patient administer single image dose 131I-TM601 , IV , demonstrate tumor uptake . Only patient demonstrate tumor uptake remain study . During first , Dose Escalation Phase study , eligible patient assign group 3-6 ( depend upon treatment response see dose ) dose cohort 2-5 weekly IV dose 131I-TM601 , escalation next high dose dependent upon demonstrate tolerance previous dose group . Patients enrol second phase assign dose determined experience first phase . Patients study phase safety parameter evaluate continuously throughout study . Clinical response 131I-TM601 assessed study patient 28 day follow final study dose , quarterly interval schedule 3 month interval follow first study dose , disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must : 1 . Have histologically prove malignant glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma glioblastoma multiforme ) progressive and/or recurrent external beam radiation therapy ( least 50 Gy ) ± chemotherapy without history surgical resection . Patients previous low grade glioma progress radiotherapy ± chemotherapy biopsied find high grade glioma eligible . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , local radiopharmaceutical injection must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon PET Thallium scan pathological documentation disease . 2 . Have bidimensional measurable disease , define ≥ 1 lesion accurately measure ≥ 2 plane postcontrast MRI . Note CT scan acceptable place MRI patient unable undergo MRI . 3 . Be ≥18 year age . 4 . Have baseline Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥60 % . 5 . Have Mini Mental State Exam score ≥ 19 . 6 . Have life expectancy , base Investigator 's judgment , &gt; 3 month . 7 . On screen ECG , QTc interval &lt; 450 ms. 8 . If taking steroid , dose stable least 5 day prior Imaging Dose . 9 . Have recover toxicity previous therapy prior enrollment . If patient undergone recent major surgery , interval least 3 week must elapse surgery date Imaging Dose . 10 . Have adequate organ marrow function define serum chemistry evaluation ( define study protocol ) . 11 . Have negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day study drug administration , female child bear potential . 12 . Agree use effective form contraception avoid pregnancy , fertile ( applicable male female patient ) . 13 . Agree refrain nursing , female . 14 . Have sign date write informed consent . 15 . Be able comply treatment plan , study procedure followup examination . Patients may : 1 . Have serious concurrent infection medical illness would jeopardize ability patient receive treatment outline protocol reasonable safety . Examples medical illness include , limited , follow : uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2 . Have prior malignancy le 5year disease free interval , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cancer cervix . 3 . Have receive radiation treatment ≤ 3 month prior first study drug administration ( Imaging Dose ) . 4 . Have receive cytotoxic chemotherapy , whether conventional investigational , ≤ 4 week prior receive first study drug ( Imaging Dose ) administration study ( 6 week mitomycinC nitrosoureas ) . 5 . Have history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 131ITM601 e.g . iodine iodinecontaining drug .</criteria>
