	<brief_summary>This study test several innovative way , several different combination PTH oral monthly ibandronate treatment osteoporosis postmenopausal woman . The intension provide option treatment current standard 2 year course drug therapy . These option may lead treatment two year therapy spread several year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTH &amp; Ibandronate Combination Study ( PICS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize double-blind clinical trial treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis conduct coordinate study investigator also participate investigator-initiated PaTH study . Final data analysis compare result trial PaTH study . In PaTH study , 238 woman 55 85 year age randomize receive either : 1 . PTH 1 year follow alendronate 1 year 2 . PTH alendronate 1 year follow alendronate 1 year 3. alendronate 2 year 4 . PTH 1 year follow placebo 1 year . In PICS 44 postmenopausal woman age 55 75 year age osteoporosis meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , randomize follow 2 treatment group . Group A receive 6 month monthly Ibandronate , plus daily PTH 1-84,100 μg ; follow 18 month Ibandronate . Group B receive 3 month daily PTH 1-84,100 μg ; follow 9 month monthly Ibandronate , 2 year . Calcium ( 400-650 mg ) Vitamin D ( 400 IU ) supplement provide participant . The primary objective determine , 3 month , woman treat concurrent combination PTH ibandronate ( Group A ) show significant increase bone marker formation compare baseline ( unlike combination PTH/alendronate-treated woman PaTH ) . This accessed examine change marker P1NP , BSAP serum CTX . As secondary objective , compare trabecular spine BMD measure treat concurrent PTH/Ibandronate ( Group A ) receive 3 month PTH follow Ibandronate ( Group B ) . Another secondary objective compare change group trabecular bone DXA spine BMD 2 year treatment . Changes fat content vertebra course PTH therapy examine use MRI spinal spectroscopy . Crosstabulation change change trabecular BMD , indicate effect measurement . As well , effect second three-month course PTH therapy Group B major interest .</detailed_description>
