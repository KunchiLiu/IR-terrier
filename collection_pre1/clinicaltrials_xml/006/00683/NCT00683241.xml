	<brief_summary>This study open woman recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma primary peritoneal cancer . Subjects ask donate either piece tumor malignant effusion order make first part vaccine lysate . If enough lystate collect make first part vaccine , subject may enroll study long meet rest entry criterion . After determined subject eligible enroll study , donate blood order make second part vaccine . After , blood vaccine mixed together make vaccine call DCVax-L. You give two dose drug call Avastin every week ( Avastin give vein ) oral chemotherapy call Cytoxan . One week last dose oral Cytoxan , receive 3 vaccine give every week next month . After first two dos vaccine , also receive Avastin . During study see study team physical exam , blood drawn order monitor health blood draw research . The study team contact next 5 year order determine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Clinical Trial Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Recurrent Ovarian Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma recurrent primary peritoneal cancer , autologous tumor malignant effusion harvest available lysate preparation , eligible , provide eligibility criterion fulfil . Harvested tumor malignant effusion ship Cognate BioServices ( Sunnyvale , CA ) preparation lysate . If sufficient amount lysate vaccine generate , subject enrol study . Subjects undergo apheresis day -35 -29 harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . The apheresis product ship Cognate BioServices , DC prepare pulse autologous lysate accord proprietary technology . Following apheresis , subject receive two cycle biological antiangiogenesis/immunomodulatory therapy comprise intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg day -28 -14 , may follow 7 day oral metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily ( day -28 -21 , -14 -7 , respectively ) . Subjects receive three dos intradermal vaccination ~5-10 x 106 dendritic cell ( DCVax-L ) day 0 , 14 28 . Subjects also receive intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg concurrently intradermal DCVax-L day 0 14 , may follow oral cyclophosphamide 50 mg 7 day ( day 0 7 , 14 21 , respectively ) . The last DCVax-L ( day 28 ) may follow oral cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily x 7 day ( day 28 35 ) , bevacizumab give day 28 . Prevnar , FDA approve seven-valent vaccine Pneumococcus pneumoniae , give intramuscularly day 0 positive control immune responsiveness . Two week follow third vaccine dose ( day 42 ) , patient undergo immune assessment . Subjects contact every 6 month 5 year annually survival . Subject option enrol combinatorial immunotherapy trial available , satisfy enrollment criterion . Subjects option continue vaccination every two month till exhaustion DCVax-L disease progression , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
