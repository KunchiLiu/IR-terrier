	<brief_summary>Organ failure follow trauma lead cause morbidity mortality . It appear development organ failure direct result alter immune response . This altered response result production circulate factor blood cause direct injury injure patient ' organ . The mechanism alter immune response occur unknown . Based work perform laboratory , believe response initiate cell membrane particular immune cell know macrophage . Although cell membrane may appear uniform , . The membrane compose specific segment allow protein associate form receptor require immune cell activation . These specific membrane component compose various lipid cholesterol , term lipid raft . Based laboratory work appear lipid raft alter follow injury . In particular lipid protein content within raft segment may alter allow immune cell become active leading production factor directly injure normal cell organ . Thus , plan examine laboratory finding see patient suffer trauma develop clinical organ failure Harborview Medical Center . If accomplish , data lead development prognostic therapeutic intervention optimal care injure patient</brief_summary>
