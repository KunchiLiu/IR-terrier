	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose pilot study determine efficacy pregabalin prolong time onset pain reduce severity pain associate walking patient neurogenic claudication . Neurogenic claudication define movement induce leg pain , numbness , heaviness , vague discomfort part one leg provoke walk stand relieve sit , squat , forward flexion posturing . The secondary objective examine functional benefit pregabalin respect improvement duration distance walking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Stenosis Outcomes Research ( LUSTOR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize one two treatment sequence : pregabalin/active placebo active placebo/pregabalin . Each arm last 10 day , washout period 10 day treatment . Pregabalin administer standardized two step titration , start 75mg twice daily maximum daily dose 150mg twice daily ; likewise , diphenhydramine ( active placebo ) administer start 6.25mg twice daily maximum daily dose 12.5mg twice daily . The primary endpoint time first symptoms moderate intensity ( NRS ≥ 4/10 ) treadmill ambulation . Ambulation assessment perform screen visit , day 10 period evaluate pain intensity associate walk well distance cover patient . Quantitative assessment ambulation conduct treadmill 0° ramp incline 1.2 mile per hour ( mph ) . Measurement self-reported symptom severity use NRS baseline , every 30 second maximum 15 minute record . The following information also record : time first symptom , total ambulation time . The examination stop 15 minute onset severe symptom . Severe symptom define level discomfort would make patient stop walk usual life situation . No one encourage prompted continue walk beyond point . Patients instructed walk upright posture . They permit lean forward hold onto handrail examination . Secondary outcome measure include area curve present pain intensity ambulation specify time point , final pain intensity walking , walk tolerance , time return baseline pain level ambulation , well result series pain related questionnaire include : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Patient Global Assessment ( PGA ) , NRS , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) , modify Brief Pain Inventory short form ( mBPI-sf ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , Swiss Spinal Stenosis ( SSS ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must present clinical symptom neurogenic claudication ( neurogenic claudication define movement induce leg pain , numbness , heaviness , vague discomfort part one leg provoke walk stand relieve sit , squat , forward flexion posturing ) endorse limitation walk tolerance due symptom Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain great equal 6 response follow question : `` Circle one number ( 0=no pain 10=worst pain ) How would rate worst leg low back pain experience walk last week ? '' Patients must confirmatory image MRI CT scan demonstrate least one level lumbar spinal stenosis within 1 year Duration symptom &gt; 3 month Age &gt; 50 year ; male female Past present existence movement disorder , e.g. , Parkinsonism , neurologic disease might affect ability ambulate ( e.g. , signs/symptoms cauda equina compression ) Cognitive impairment prevent full understanding participation study Peripheral vascular disease Moderate severe arthritis knee hip might severely compromise ambulation Past present low extremity peripheral vascular disease Serious concomitant medical illness ( e.g. , heart disease ) might impair ambulation assessment Previous lumbar surgery spinal stenosis ( laminectomy without fusion ) within past 2 year Prior treatment study drug neurogenic claudication Severe psychiatric disorder Mean time severe symptom &gt; 15 minute .
