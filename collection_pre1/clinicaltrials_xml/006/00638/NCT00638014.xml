	<brief_summary>The primary objective establish Rapid Sternal Closure System ( RSCS ) improve early postoperative recovery manifest decreased pain improve pulmonary function . Secondary objective include evaluation Rapid Sternal Closure System regard SWCs ( surgical wound complication define surgically treat sternal wound infection sternal instability/non-union ) outline protocol . For give study endpoint , null hypothesis difference Rapid Sternal Closure System group control group . The alternative hypothesis difference 2 group . The statistical objective study reject null hypothesis favor alternative hypothesis .</brief_summary>
