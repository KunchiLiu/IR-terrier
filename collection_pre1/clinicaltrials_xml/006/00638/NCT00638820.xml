	<brief_summary>We believe hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) help subject Osteopetrosis generate functioning osteoclast , assist resolution abnormal bone architecture , anemia bone marrow failure also characteristic disease . However , find past study approximately 30 % Osteopetrosis patient engraft . Therefore , study , plan use different combination pre-transplant drug try make transplant safer disease , well provide second infusion stem cell patient match related unrelated donor . The purpose research find safer effective mean perform stem cell transplantation patient Osteopetrosis , use chemotherapy radiation design bring engraftment lessen transplant mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity AlloTransplant For Osteopetrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This transplant protocol test following : 1 ) ability achieve engraftment reduce intensity protocol , 2 ) mortality associate transplant day 100 , 3 ) patient outcome , base differential image biologic evaluation prior transplantation designate point transplantation ( day 100 , 6 month , 1 , 2 5 year ) . Additional biologic study include microarray analysis , Campath level prior administration graft , establishment mesenchymal stem cell line . In old patient , study evaluation osteoclast differentiation function also offer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible transplantation protocol &lt; 45 year age , diagnose severe osteopetrosis . This define follow manifestation disease . Bones uniformly markedly dense base skeletal survey No history would suggest autosomal dominant inheritance Evidence hematologic change attribute underlying disease , include need ongoing transfusion , OR presence progressive anemia thrombocytopenia , OR white blood cell differential predominance immature form evidence extramedullary hematopoiesis , OR persistence serious infectious complication think due abnormal architecture bone resistant surgical medical intervention . Patients &gt; 45 year age Evidence hepatic failure pulmonary dysfunction sufficient substantially increase risk transplant Renal dysfunction glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 % predict . Cardiac compromise sufficient substantially increase risk transplantation Severe , stable neurologic impairment . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity .
