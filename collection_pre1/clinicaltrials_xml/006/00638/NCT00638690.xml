	<detailed_description>Abiraterone acetate steroidal irreversible inhibitor CYP17 ( 17Î± hydroxylase/C17 , 20-lyase ) , block 2 important enzymatic activity synthesis testosterone . The goal study compare clinical benefit abiraterone acetate plus prednisone placebo plus prednisone patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) fail one two chemotherapy regimen , one contain docetaxel . All patient involve study randomize ( assigned chance ) one two arm know study drug give . Study drug randomization allocation 2:1 ( abiraterone acetate : placebo ) . The study conduct United States , Canada , Australia , EU . The study consist screening , treatment , follow-up . In study , patient receive study treatment ( abiraterone acetate placebo ) plus prednisone progression clinical disease . Follow-up continue patient dy , lose follow-up , withdraws informed consent . After provide write informed consent , patient screen procedure complete determine eligibility . Safety evaluation screen procedure include physical examination , vital sign , clinical blood laboratory test , ECG , radiograph , urine test , record adverse event include detail current prostate cancer symptom . Patients ask use method birth control adequate barrier protection determine acceptable principal investigator sponsor study 13 week last study drug administration . Study medication , abiraterone acetate , oral ( mouth ) medication administer four ( 4 ) 250mg abiraterone acetate tablet 4 placebo tablet take least one hour two hour meal anytime 10PM everyday . Prednisone administer 5mg orally twice day group . Each cycle 28 day . Study treatment continue disease progression determine investigator patient meet criteria withdrawal study .</detailed_description>
