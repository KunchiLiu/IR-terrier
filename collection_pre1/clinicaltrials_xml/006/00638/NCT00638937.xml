	<brief_title>AZD0530 Treat Recurrent Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC Previously Treated With Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess rate disease control ( i.e. , lack disease progression , combine rate objective complete partial response , stable disease ) least 4 cycle therapy patient AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer previously treat platinum-based combination chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate ( complete partial response ) , stable disease rate , duration response stable disease , progression-free , median 6 month overall survival rate , safety tolerability treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential predictive marker assess pretreatment intratumoral level src , Y419 phospho-src ( P-Src ) c-terminal src kinase ( Csk ) archival tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample collect baseline 2 week begin treatment analyze c-Src protein expression activity immunofluorescence stain . P-glycoprotein level phosphorylation focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , paxillin , caveolin , Stat-3 also measure use tumor tissue sample . Blood sample also use measure level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week .</detailed_description>
