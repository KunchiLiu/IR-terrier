	<brief_title>Inter-Assay Growth Hormone IGF-I Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research explore variability GH IGF-1 measurement commercially available test . The hypothesis variability GH IGF-1 measurement sizable enough different conclusion would draw patient case decision make diagnosis management GH deficiency acromegaly . In order correctly diagnose disorder growth hormone secretion , either deficiency excess , necessary accurate measurement GH ( growth hormone ) serum Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) . For study , subject ask give Investigators additional blood either OGTT ( test acromegaly ) growth hormone stimulation test ( GHRH-arginine stimulation ) . Ordinarily , blood would measure begin end OGTT , GHRH-arginine would measure one half hour test every half hour 2 hour . For study , subject provide u additional blood time blood drawn clinically-indicated test . No additional needle stick necessary take additional blood interfere clinical test . The test additional blood identical test ordinarily , do different lab . We test see result would usual lab . The study population include 1 ) subject pituitary disease undergo test GH deficiency ( GHRH arginine stimulation test ) , 2 ) subject suspicion acromegaly undergo oral glucose tolerance test ( oGTT ) , 3 ) normal control undergo GHRH Arginine test oGTT . Patients group blood drawn measurement IGF-1 . The serum test aliquoted sent designate lab . For subject group 1 2 , study pose minimal risk , involve procedure go beyond clinical care . For healthy control , know participant ask undergo test would normally require , therefore feel study pose minimal risk . For primary endpoint research sample compare sample send usual clinical lab , diagnosis make base research sample compare clinical sample . For secondary endpoint , result commercially available assay correlate another corresponding method analysis hormone time point use Bland-Altman analysis wherein difference two method compare mean two method . Each sample compare sample use clinical evaluation . Information medical record obtain correlated lab test result .</detailed_description>
