	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) condition critical importance Veterans Health Administration affect 15 % Vietnam combat veterans.1 Studies animal demonstrate stress associate alteration morphology hippocampus , brain structure involve learning memory , well memory deficit . Patients PTSD small hippocampal volume magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) deficits memory neuropsychological testing . Animal model also show progressive diminution hippocampal volume normal age associated loss memory function . In human , old age individual hippocampus becomes small , associated decline memory function . Clinically , PTSD patient appear rapid rate memory decline age , lead characterize `` accelerated aging '' ; however little empiric data relate interaction normal age PTSD effect memory . In prior period VA Merit funding PI study memory hippocampus twin pair discordant PTSD well normal twin pair . We study 42 MZ DZ twin pair discordant Vietnam theater exposure discordant PTSD 28 MZ DZ twin pair concordant Vietnam theater exposure discordant PTSD . All twin underwent measure hippocampal volume , neuropsychological testing , cortisol . A subset 10 pair MZ pair discordant PTSD combat exposure underwent positron emission tomography ( PET ) image neural correlate declarative memory function . Preliminary analysis consistent small hippocampal volume deficit verbal declarative memory PTSD affect twin compare non-PTSD brother expose Vietnam combat . We propose measure hippocampal volume , memory function , neural correlate declarative memory , MZ DZ twin previously study , discordant combat PTSD . We study 42 twin pair study 1999-2003 , 34 discordant PTSD Atlanta base assessment study data include MRI , neuropsychological testing , cortisol ( PET subsample 10 pair ) , repeat measurement perform 8 year initial assessment , time life become vulnerable memory decline associate age ( subject discordant PTSD Atlanta base assessment also study comparison ) . These assessment allow comprehensive assessment relative impact share environment ( e.g . family life ) , unique environment ( Vietnam theater service ) , genetics outcomes interest . We hypothesize interaction PTSD diagnosis age , i.e . PTSD patient relative non-PTSD show small hippocampal volume measure MRI , deficits verbal declarative memory measure neuropsychological testing , low cortisol , failure hippocampal function memory task measure PET , rate decline great PTSD v non PTSD . We hypothesize analysis twin pair combination show combine impact genetics PTSD diagnosis hippocampal outcomes interest .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All twin require give write informed consent . Subjects include history Vietnam Era service . All subject must free major medical illness basis history physical examination , lab testing , electrocardiogram . Subjects exclude history shrapnel foreign body would preclude MRI scanning , history loss consciousness , neuroleptic , sedative benzodiazepine medication usage within previous four week . Subjects also exclude base SCID interview comorbid : schizophrenia ; schizoaffective disorder ; bulimia anorexia , bipolar disorder . Subjects also exclude history blast injury associate traumatic brain injury . In addition , subject exclude history alcohol substance abuse/dependence within past year . We use strategy use prior MRI study use multivariate analysis examine contribution past history alcohol substance abuse ( measure Addiction Severity Index ) depression symptom level ( measure Hamilton Depression Scale ) outcomes interest . Subjects exclude study present history serious medical neurological illness , result routine laboratory study , history asthma , steroid usage , seizure disorder , prenatal/perinatal substance exposure trauma .</criteria>
