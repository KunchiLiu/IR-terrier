	<brief_summary>Needle biopsy way determine whether lung mass cancerous benign . Its accuracy establish research patient underwent fine needle aspiration , kind needle biopsy yield sample cytology ( similar way pap smear fluid sample would evaluate malignant cell ) . This kind needle biopsy may supplement replace core needle biopsy , yield sample histology ( similar surgical tissue sample small scale ) rather cytology . Core needle biopsy believe helpful particularly obtain diagnosis patient lung mass doctor think cancerous , fact , benign . In spite advance needle biopsy , however , patient receive pathology report indicate evidence cancer whose lung mass actually cancerous . The fraction patient , among patient evidence cancer accord biopsy , call `` false negative rate . '' It approximately 25 % needle biopsy consist fine needle aspiration alone . The false negative rate needle biopsy include core biopsy sample know . We want examine accuracy needle biopsy patient core sample take lung mass addition , place , fine needle aspiration . In study focus patient evidence cancer accord biopsy , determine many actually cancer miss biopsy . To accomplish goal , need review medical record patient one two thing : either definitive diagnosis lung mass mean ( example , surgical biopsy ) , see patient period time ( usually conjunction medical imaging test chest x-rays chest CT scan ) . To establish lung mass benign observe patient time , necessary show lung mass disappear , become small , remain unchanged size 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We review medical record identify patient underwent percutaneous needle biopsy lung mass 5/1/01 10/30/04 . If pathology report indicate biopsy show evidence malignancy , examine medical record `` gold standard '' diagnosis lesion question , include pathology result surgical resection repeat biopsy , image follow-up demonstrate regression lesion size stability least 2 year , clinical follow-up least 2 year clinical evidence malignant disease . If information available University Hospital medical record , contact patient obtain consent follow-up use external source ( physician record , image study , pathology report ) . We derive descriptive statistic ( prevalence malignancy , sensitivity , specificity , false negative rate ) . The overall sample size ~500 patient PTNB lung mass within study period . Approximately 80 expect biopsy result show evidence malignancy , base retrospective review perform IRB exemption ( 87-04 , letter date 9/28/04 ) . The expected proportion case evidence malignancy approximately 0.15 . For 95 % confidence interval 0.15+/-0.075 need follow-up information 61 patient , consider descriptive study dichotomous variable . This give u margin patient lose follow-up</detailed_description>
