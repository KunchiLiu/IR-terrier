	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare feature pathologist see , examine lung tumor microscope , way tumor appear compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Features tumor may include abnormal blood vessel area tumor cell die . The sample take needle biopsy contain information one small part tumor . The investigator believe show tumor sample come , base CT scan biopsy procedure . If investigator accurately determine tumor sample come , compare feature part tumor , see CT image , feature part tumor see microscope . This research study also give investigator idea much biopsy sample distort process prepare examination microscope .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Newer cross-sectional imaging method allow improve visualization anatomic detail—for example , high-resolution CT spatial resolution le 1 mm 3 dimension . These image method also provide limited amount physiologic information—for example , tumor perfusion demonstrate enhancement intravenous contrast agent . Radiologic-pathologic correlation current era give u opportunity work finer spatial scale take advantage additional physiologic information . Pathologic assessment tissue evolve time . Tissue stain traditional way microscopic evaluation newer tool immunohistochemistry , recently , method molecular biology apply well . We interested radiologic-pathologic correlation lung tumor . Tumors know heterogeneous ; want develop approach allow u explore spatial organization . We rely surgical resection provide tissue pathologic evaluation , majority lung lesion never come resection . For example , ~15 % lung cancer patient surgical candidate . The remainder would lose classical approach depend surgery . Percutaneous needle biopsy provide alternative mean tissue sample . This safe , effective commonly use way obtain sample tissue ( `` core sample '' ) give lung mass . The pathologist process core sample way surgical specimen .</detailed_description>
