	<brief_title>Bifidobacterium Lactis BB12 Xylitol Delivered With Novel Slow-release Pacifier</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Xylitol know reduce count mutans streptococci ( m ) well mother-child transmission m . Possibly xylitol deliver infant could positively influence colonization/metabolism ms. By combine food supplement xylitol B. lactis BB12 ( well know probiotic bacteria ) may able positively affect gut oral colonization , reflect dental general health ( solid data available latter aim ) . Though B. lactis wide use baby formula vitro test apparently safe teeth , clinical study look effect administration infants oral health . Our study aim look caries occurrence infant receive xylitol + BB12 food supplement pacifier . Recruiting subject study complete .</detailed_description>
