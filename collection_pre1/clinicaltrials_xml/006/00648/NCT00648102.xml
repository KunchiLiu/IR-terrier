	<brief_summary>This research study individual advance breast , colon , pancreatic , ovarian bladder cancer . Celldex Therapeutics , Inc. test form immune therapy ( vaccine ) see use make immune system attack cancer . The study include administration additional treatment , combination , think enhance immune response effect . This study specifically administers vaccine systemically explore whether dendritic cell target vaccine generate robust effect via intravenous injection . ( CDX 1307-02 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study CDX-1307 , hCG-B Vaccine , Patients With Incurable , Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast , Colorectal , Pancreatic , Bladder Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol CDX1307-02 : CDX-1307 investigational drug test see stimulate immune system ( cell substance protect body infection foreign matter ) people certain kind cancer . It believe body 's immune system attack tumor cell kill . It think immune cell recognize special protein surface tumor signal fight cancer . One proteins call human chorionic gonadotropin-beta ( hCG-β ) find several type cancer include breast , colorectal , pancreatic , bladder ovarian . The study drug , CDX-1307 , give intravenous infusion ( administer vein arm port-a-catheter ) . In addition , study include combination therapy think stimulate immune response tumor cell . In addition , study include combination therapy think stimulate immune response tumor cell .</detailed_description>

Locally advanced breast cancer define inflammatory breast cancer biopsyproven skin involvement , chest wall recurrence . Locally advanced disease histology define accord standard definition disease . Evaluableonly disease include bone unresectable skin/chest wall metastasis , include malignant effusion ( ) . Cancer elevate serum tumor marker ( ) ( e.g . CA27.29 , carcinoembryonic antigen , etc . ) constitute evaluable disease . 2 . Patients must 18 year age old . 3 . Both gender may enrol . 4 . At least 4 week must elapse prior therapy initiation treatment CDX1307 . Prior radiation therapy must complete least 4 week prior enrollment . No prior radiopharmaceutical within 8 week prior enrollment . The patient must recover clinically significant toxicity experience prior treatment ( ) . 5 . Patients follow medication may enrol study medication initiate ≥ 8 week prior Screening dose change anticipate study : 1 . Hormonal therapy include gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRh ) agonist , antiandrogens , selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) , aromatase inhibitor , progestin . 2 . Bisphosphonates . 6 . Patients must ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . 7 . Breast cancer patient must receive progress least one line chemotherapy endocrine therapy metastatic unresectable locally advanced breast cancer . Patients HER2positive breast cancer must receive progress least one line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab , endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab , metastatic unresectable locally advanced breast cancer . For incurable colorectal , pancreatic , bladder , ovarian cancer , therapy potential survival benefit available diseasespecific palliation goal therapy , patient must receive appropriate standard care therapy experience recurrence progression care . If therapy available , patient progressive disease may enrol . Chemotherapy radiation must discontinue least 4 week prior initiation vaccination CDX1307 . 8 . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 16 week . 9 . Male patient sexually active must agree practice effective form barrier contraception course study . 10 . Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : Neutrophils ≥1.5 x109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x109/L Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL AST ≤2 X ULN Bilirubin ≤2 X ULN unless due Gilbert 's syndrome . * Laboratory abnormality attribute liver involvement cancer outside normal range allow exceed follow limit : AST ≤4 X ULN Exclusion Criteria 1 . Since treatment CDX1307 theoretically may cause permanent sterility , woman childbearing potential exclude . Women participate study must postmenopausal [ absence menses least 2 year age &gt; 55 ] and/or surgically incapable bearing child . 2 . Previous administration hCGβ vaccine therapy . 3 . Concurrent treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent . 4 . Positive test HIV , HBV HCV . 5 . Patients systemic infection within 72 hour registration require antibiotic produce fever &gt; 101oF . 6 . Patients active central nervous system metastasis , unless previously treat asymptomatic progressive size number 2 month ( 1 month case stereotactic radiation ) . 7 . History second malignancy , except adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer cervical cancer situ ; cancer patient diseasefree ≥ 5 year . 8 . History anaphylactic reaction follow exposure humanize human therapeutic monoclonal antibody , know hypersensitivity GMCSF yeast derive product . 9 . Patients follow condition : myocardial infarction within 1 year Screening , congestive heart failure ( unless LVEF ≥ 50 % determine MUGA within 30 day Screening ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( ≥ 160 mm Hg/systolic ≥ 100 mm Hg/diastolic ) , symptomatic lifethreatening arrhythmia persistent medication Screening , clinically evident chronic lung disease unless lung capacity ≥ 55 % FEV1 ≥ 60 % Screening . Note performance MUGA scan Pulmonary Function Tests require except clinically indicate . 10 . Any underlying medical condition Principal Investigator 's opinion make administration study drug hazardous patient would obscure interpretation adverse event . 11 . Medical condition require use corticosteroid ( must discontinue least 4 week prior enrollment ) .</criteria>
