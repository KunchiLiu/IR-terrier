	<detailed_description>COPD encompass number chronic lung disorder obstruct airway may accompany airway hyperactivity . The common form COPD combination chronic bronchitis emphysema . Many sign symptom associate chronic bronchitis result airway mucus hypersecretion induce chronic inflammation airway . Clinically , mucus hypersecretion result impair gas exchange compromise mucociliary clearance , encourage bacterial colonization associate exacerbation . A treatment inhibit mucus hypersecretion block inflammation could benefit COPD patient chronic bronchitis . The drug evaluation study , BIO 11006 , new therapeutic agent may inhibit mucus secretion may important anti inflammatory property . In study , BIO-11006 administer COPD patient chronic bronchitis , effect lung function assess .</detailed_description>
