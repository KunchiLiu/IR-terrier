	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well lenalidomide work treat patient progressive recurrent multiple myeloma donor stem cell transplant . Lenalidomide may stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Multiple Myeloma After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response relapse progressive multiple myeloma lenalidomide allogeneic stem cell transplant . II . Proportion patient achieve complete , partial minor response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate toxicity tolerability lenalidomide set . II . For patient chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , evaluate response lenalidomide . III . Evaluate time progression ( TTP ) . IV . Evaluate overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year longer absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
