	<brief_title>Oral OKT3 Combination With Beta-D-Glucosylceramide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti CD3 ( OKT3 ) : Is approve drug intravenous use treatment solid organ transplantation . Preliminary data suggest oral administration OKT3 low dosage exert immune modulatory effect via activation regulatory T lymphocyte . β-D glucosylceramide [ GC ] : Is approve oral administration currently test three clinical trial . Recent data suggest serve immunological adjuvant various clinical setting augment immune response via activation regulatory T cell . This clinical trial design assess safety oral administration OKT3 without co-administration GC healthy subject . The use two potential activator regulatory T cell , may exert additive effect , augment systemic immune modulatory effect .</detailed_description>
