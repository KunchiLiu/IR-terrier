	<brief_summary>The information collect optimize management patient gram negative bacteremia . Approximately 300 patient Gram negative bacteremia care year UPMC-P . Published medical literature suggest mortality infection exceed 20 % . The aim research determine risk factor bacteriologic failure antibiotic therapy , risk factor antibiotic resistance bloodstream isolate risk factor mortality Gram negative bacteremia . Modifiable risk factor tackle future interventional study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The information collect optimize management patient gram negative bacteremia . Approximately 300 patient Gram negative bacteremia care year UPMC-P. All sit collect follow information collect part patient 's clinical treatment . The following variable collect site : time location positive culture , underlie disease severity illness , recent immunomodulative therapy , physical exam finding , laboratory radiographical data , antimicrobial usage within 14 day onset bacteremia , microbiological data resistance pattern , choice antibiotic organism identify , suspect source bacteremia , bacteriological outcome , laboratory result , demographic information , medication , clinical outcome , gender , height , weight , ethnicity , past medical history ( please see attached clinical data collection worksheet date 4/2005 ) . We also collect information retrospectively one year prospectively one year . The bacteria patient 's blood culture subcultured ( diagnosis obtain since microbiology lab would otherwise destroy culture ) provide honest broker deidentify specimen link medical information collect ( also deidentified honest broker ) . The following evaluation perform sample . The minimal inhibitory concentration antibiotic use treatment perform E-Test method ( AB Biodisk , Solna , Sweden ) . Specific mechanisms antimicrobial resistance study emphasis presence beta-lactamase produce bacteria . This evaluation perform analytical isoelectric focus technique well PCR gene sequence analysis determine gene encode beta-lactamase . Biologic sample control principal investigator research project . All sample provide investigator deidentified honest broker cod number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location honest broker access . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . Samples keep investigator 's laboratory locate Scaife Hall , room 812 , 3500 Terrace Street . At time research investigator access patient identifers . Medical record information bacteria sample facility outside UPMC provide PI de-identified . At time anyone research team access patient identifier . All information bacteria collect part patient 's clinical treatment .</detailed_description>
