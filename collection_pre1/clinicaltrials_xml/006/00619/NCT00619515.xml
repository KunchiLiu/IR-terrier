	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate low- low-to-intermediate-risk group patient prostate cancer , rate acute toxicity observe 5 year follow CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . Secondary - To estimate rate late grade 3-5 toxicity SRS patient . - To measure biochemical disease-free survival patient treat therapy . - To measure rate local failure , distant failure , disease-free survival , disease-specific survival , overall survival patient treat therapy . - To measure quality life generic organ-specific domain patient treat therapy . - To evaluate image modality potential role detection prostate cancer persistence , recurrence , and/or progression patient treat therapy . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord risk group ( low risk v low/intermediate risk ) . Patients undergo fiducial placement use ultrasound . At least 5-10 day later , patient undergo CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery daily 5 day . Patients complete 4 questionnaire baseline periodically study assess acute late toxicity quality life ( e.g. , overall health status , patient function , sexual function , urinary symptom ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
