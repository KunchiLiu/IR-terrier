	<brief_title>Study Sorafenib Infusional 5-Fluorouracil Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous chemotherapeutic regimen test use hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . HCC , however , highly resistant chemotherapy ; doxorubicin 5- fluorouracil contain regimen , alone combination , result less 20 % response , median survival le 4 month . Furthermore even objective response short-lasting . In metaanalysis publish randomized study HCC , neither doxorubicin chemotherapeutic agent show survival benefit HCC patient . Sorafenib ( Bay 43-9006 ) novel signal transduction inhibitor prevent tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis blockade Raf/Mek/Erk pathway level Raf Kinase receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 PDGFR-beta . Recent preclinical study show activation Mek-1/2 downstream target MAPK HCC tumor . In phase II study 137 patient advanced primary liver cancer treat Sorafenib administer single agent . Investigators report seven patient partial response , five minor response 59 stable disease least 4 month . Median overall survival 9.2 month median time progression 4.2 month . This study show Sorafenib well tolerate side-effects manageable reversible . Rationale 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) widely use agent patient unresectable advanced HCC , objective response rate around 10 % . Compared bolus administration , infusional 5-FU metastatic colorectal cancer demonstrate increased activity less toxicity . Sorafenib single agent HCC demonstrate activity term objective response promise duration stable disease . The combination Sorafenib 5-FU evaluate phase I study drug associate different 5FU base schedule good toxicity profile objective responses particular colorectal carcinoma . Based data purpose study infusional 5-FU Sorafenib evaluate activity , efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics combination . Study design duration treatment 5-FU 3000 mg/sqm 48 hour continuous infusion every 14 day Sorafenib 400 mg bid orally continuously 5-FU administer maximum 12 cycle . Sorafenib administer start treatment combination 5-FU progression disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening must do within 28 day study drug administration ( laboratory evaluation must do within 7 day ) . For inclusion study , patient must fulfill follow criterion : Age 18 year . Patients proven primary HCC accord one follow criterion : Histological evidence HCC biopsy specimen . Patients fibrolamellar subset exclude , patient mixed histology . Cytological evidence HCC acceptable tissue obtain histological evaluation . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Life expectancy least 12 week pretreatment evaluation . Inoperable tumor ( T2T4 , N , M0 M1 define TNM classification ) Patient consider investigator appropriate systemic therapy . Patients least one measurable lesion CTscan MRI accord Recist criterion , perform within 4 week prior start dose . Patients receive systemic anticancer treatment HCC : chemotherapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , vaccine well systemic agent give antineoplastic intent , prior study inclusion . ( previous local therapy permit ) . Previous treatment Octreotide however allow , provide administration drug discontinue least 7 day prior enrolment least 28 day LAR ( long act release ) formulation drug use . Patients receive local therapy , : surgery , radiation therapy , hepatic arterial embolization , chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation cryoablation eligible , provide either target lesion subject local therapy and/or target lesion ( ) within field local therapy show increase 25 % size . Furthermore , local therapy apply target nontarget lesion need complete least 8 week prior study inclusion ( Lesions treat external beam radiation therapy acceptable target lesion , unless fulfill condition describe ) . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function , assess follow laboratory requirement conduct within 7 day prior screen : Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dl Absolute granulocytes 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count 60 x 109/L Total serum bilirubin 3 mg/dl ALT ( SGOT ) AST ( SGPT ) 5 x upper limit normal PTINR 2.3 PT 6 second control Serum creatinine 1.5 x upper limit normal . Cirrhotic status Child 's Pugh class A B . Child 's Pugh class C exclude Written Informed Consent must obtain document prior study specific procedure . Patients meet follow criterion time screen exclude ; exclude medical condition : Congestive heart failure define NYHA class III IV . Serious cardiac arrhythmia . Active coronary artery disease ischemia . Active clinically serious infection ( &gt; grade 2 NCICTC ) . Known history HIV infection . Known metastatic brain meningeal tumor . History seizure disorder . History organ allograft . Previous malignancy ( except cervical carcinoma situ , adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor [ Ta , Tis &amp; T1 ] malignancy curatively treat &gt; 3 year prior entry ) . Patients clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within past month prior study entry ineligible . Excluded therapy medication , previous concomitant : Any systemic anticancer treatment agent administer antineoplastic intent , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , vaccine hormonal therapy give study entry study treatment . Anticancer therapy define agent combination agent clinically proven anticancer activity administer systemically , purpose affect cancer , either directly indirectly , include palliative therapeutic endpoint . In certain case , local anticancer therapy allow . See Inclusion Criteria detail . Any surgical procedure within 4 week prior start study drug . Autologous bone marrow transplant stem cell rescue within 4 month study entry . Use biologic response modifier , GCSF , within 3 week study entry . GCSF hematopoietic growth factor may use management acute toxicity , febrile neutropenia , clinically indicate , discretion investigator ; however , may substitute require dose reduction . Chronic Erythropoietin treatment prior study entry study permit . Use ritonavir grapefruit juice . Prior use RafKinase inhibitor , MEK Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors . Any investigational drug therapy outside trial within 4 week study entry . Other Pregnant breastfeeding patient . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day start treatment . Both men woman enrol trial must use adequate barrier birth control measure ( e.g . cervical cap , condom , diaphragm ) course trial . Oral birth control method alone consider adequate study , potential pharmacokinetic interaction SORAFENIB oral contraceptive . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition , judgment investigator , likely interfere patient 's participation study evaluation study result . Known allergy investigational agent agent give association trial . Any condition unstable could jeopardize safety patient compliance study , investigator 's judgment .</criteria>
