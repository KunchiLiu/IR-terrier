	<brief_summary>Bacterial meningitis remain significant cause morbidity mortality child , especially country limit resource . Efforts improve grim outcome include alter first line antibiotic therapy , control seizure manage fluid carefully . Adjuvant therapy steroid use limited success child West proven value Malawi resource constrain setting . Glycerol use reduce brain oedema neurosurgery recently show reduce morbidity childhood meningitis South America . Paracetamol high dosage show reduce inflammation cytokine level septicaemia improve outcome adult . In Malawi investigator try adjuvant steroid improvement outcome childhood meningitis . They recently conclude study ceftriaxone show improvement mortality though less hearing loss chloramphenicol benzyl penicillin . Following encouraging result Childhood South American Study important ass use adjuvant glycerol child investigator ' setting . Paracetamol routinely use meningitis accompany fever headache . This opportunity study place adjuvant therapy carefully previously do . The investigator propose prospective , randomize , double blind 2 2 factorial design study ass advantage ceftriaxone ( antibiotic ) give paracetamol glycerol combination , singly neither adjuvant therapy childhood bacterial meningitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bacterial meningitis ( BM ) major cause morbidity death develop world . Hib pneumococcal conjugate vaccine potential prevent meningitis neither vaccine available many country limit resource . New ( expensive ) antimicrobials do little improve prognosis . A background HIV infection many part world add grim prognosis childhood BM . Adjuvant dexamethasone gain much attention , effect damp host 's inflammatory response childhood BM . However , little clinical benefit observe several study . Most importantly , first sufficiently power study Malawi find benefit . Another sufficiently power ( N=654 ) study childhood BM , recently complete Latin America , show little benefit dexamethasone even Hib meningitis show benefit adjuvant oral glycerol . It known glycerol work , probably one mechanism . One-third child bacterial meningitis suffer significantly reduce cerebral blood flow cause intracranial oedema . Glycerol slightly increase serum osmolality , small change may improve rheology enhance cerebral circulation , perhaps increase perfusion pressure . Thus , extravascularization water hidden hypovolemia improve . Osmotic diuresis less importance , urinary output increase dos ( 6 ml/kg/day ) glycerol . A gradient body compartment would require intact nearly intact blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , case BM . Glycerol also scavenger free oxygen radical . This activity may alleviate inflammation characteristic BM . Paracetamol use widely antipyretic , analgesic , anti inflammatory agent . It effective , safe , inexpensive , available syrup , tablet , suppository injection ; suit age . The effect dose-dependent . There contraindication , eg allergy . The mechanism well understood , NSAIDs dampen inflammatory reaction mediate inhibition arachidonic acid metabolism . There differences paracetamol NSAIDs : paracetamol inhibits centrally locate COX 3 NMDA receptor , NSAIDs inhibit COX 2 receptor periphery . These mechanism may partly explain different result patient outcome . In retrospective analysis 809 adult patient bacteremia Finland , receive paracetamol good survival rate treat NSAIDs salicylate . A prospective clinical trial childhood BM value glycerol review , potential paracetamol examine warrant . Both adjuvant aim improve poor prognosis disease . Objectives A Prospective , Randomized , Double-Blind Clinical Study Using Two-by-Two Factorial Design answer two question : 1 . Can prognosis childhood BM improve give adjuvant oral glycerol ? 2 . Can outcome improved large dos rectal paracetamol ? The primary end point : 1. death , 2. severe neurological sequela discharge 3. post meningitis , severe , sensorineural hearing loss hospital discharge . Various patient characteristic take account covariates , eg severity illness , age , aetiological agent , haemoglobin level , HIV status presence malaria co-infection . The secondary end point 1. audiological neurological sequela ( accord Denver-II developmental screen test ) .</detailed_description>
