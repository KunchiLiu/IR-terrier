The Best Infant Nutrition Good Outcomes ( BINGO ) trial randomize woman one four treatment group : ( ) Prenatal Care Provider ( PNC ) ; ( b ) Lactation Consultant ( LC ) ; ( c ) PNC + LC , ; ( ) Control . Thus , separate synergistic effect intervention test , compare Control standard care . The intervention design build upon prior trial LC intervention alone . PNCsâ€” certify nurse midwife ob/gyns -- use brief , electronically prompt protocol woman PNC , PNC + LC group throughout pregnancy . An LC arrange pre-natal one-on-one meeting , daily hospital , home visit woman LC PNC+LC group . Descriptive data infant health visit , participant/provider experience collect secondary outcome . Interviews 1,3 6 month post-partum collect infant feeding , health visit data outside medical center . Medical center visit data obtain MIS data . Primary Outcomes ( Hypotheses ) : Breastfeeding 1 .

	<brief_title>Boosting Breastfeeding Low-Income , Multi-ethnic Women : A Primary Care Based RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Outcomes ( Hypotheses ) : Breastfeeding 1 . Breastfeeding Intensity 1,3 , 6 Months- There significant difference breastfeed intensity among 4 treatment group . We expect intensity great PNC+LC group , follow LC , PNC , Control group , respectively . Intensity assess via 7 day recall frequency breastmilk feeding vs. liquid solid . 2 . Exclusive Breastfeeding 1,3 , 6 Months- There significant difference rate exclusive breastfeeding among 4 treatment group . We expect rate exclusive breastfeeding great PNC+LC group , follow LC , PNC , Control group , respectively . Secondary Outcomes ( Descriptive ) : Infant Health , Participant/Provider Experience 3 . To describe frequency time infant health visit `` breast-feeding sensitive '' illness ( i.e. , otitis medium , gastrointestinal , respiratory infection ) treatment group . 4 . To describe frequency time infant health visit `` breast-feeding sensitive '' illness intensity breastfeed regardless group assignment . 5 . To describe participant provider ( LC PNC ) experience intervention . BINGO first RCT US routine provider , primary-care base intervention increase breastfeeding ( BF ) . Government task force US3 Canada specifically call trial , well trial assess independent effect combine intervention . BINGO first trial apply strategy derive current National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign ( NBAC ) . BINGO employ NBAC message -- exclusive BF 6 month reduces infant ear infection , diarrhea , respiratory illness , perhaps childhood obesity . We expect message yield great BF intensity , thus progress toward pending Healthy People 2010 goal exclusive BF . BINGO use evidence-based strategy practice , consistent NIH roadmap . Its intervention logistically economically sustainable clinical practice . They support woman pre- post-natally , across multiple care setting ( clinic , hospital , home ) . Both Certified Nurse Midwives Ob/Gyns , deliver PNC intervention , thus increase generalizability . BINGO enthusiastic support perinatal nursing , physician , lactation specialist group . This support , outset , provide foundation effective BINGO intervention translate practice .</detailed_description>
