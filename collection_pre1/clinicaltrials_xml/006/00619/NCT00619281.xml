	<detailed_description>Low output syndrome common complication patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Its incidence report 2 6 % [ 1 ] . In patient suffer low output syndrome cardiac output severely reduce due myocardial failure . Among reason myocardial failure , ischemia , insufficient myocardial protection aortic cross-clamping , severely reduce ventricular function prior surgery common risk factor low output syndrome . Low output syndrome treat positive inotropic drug mechanical assist device [ 2 ] . Morbidity mortality low output syndrome high cost treat disease immense . If cardiac output increase cardiac failure persist vital organ hypoperfused . Critical prolong hypoperfusion result single multi organ failure . Until today definite threshold critically reduce cardiac output cardiac index require immediate therapy completely know . Cardiogenic shock diagnose clinical sign diagnose cardiac output cardiac index . The critical value severely reduce cardiac index report range 1.75 2.5L/min/mÂ² [ 3-5 ] . The primary objective prospective observational study 600 patient undergoing cardiac surgery try define threshold critically reduce cardiac output cardiac index require immediate therapy . If cardiac output cardiac index reduce critical threshold , morbidity , mortality , length stay intensive care unit hospital reduce [ 6 ] .</detailed_description>
