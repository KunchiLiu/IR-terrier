	<brief_title>Energy Balance Weight Regulation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rise epidemic obesity United States accompany widespread public use low carbohydrate diet weight loss . The popularity diet due partly promise `` metabolic advantage '' promotes faster weight loss without override sense hunger . If claim true , hypothesize low-carbohydrate diet impact hormone factor regulate appetite energy balance , result low energy intake great weight loss , high complex carbohydrate diet . To test hypothesis , conduct randomize , control feed trial obese adult randomly assign one three intervention : low-carbohydrate-ad libitum diet , high-carbohydrate-ad libitum diet , high-carbohydrate-energy-restricted diet . The low-carbohydrate diet model Induction Phase Atkins Diet . The high carbohydrate diet base `` Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) '' diet . Participants eat standardized weight maintenance diet 3 week . Then , 6-weeks , participant assign either ad libitum group give assign diet 120 % estimate energy need maintain weight allow eat much desire . Participants assign energy-restricted group provide DASH diet 67 % estimate energy need maintain weight ask eat food provide . Food intake measure daily . Body weight hunger satiety score measure three time week . Body composition energy expenditure measure intervention . 24-hour profile hormone factor influence central appetite weight regulation ( insulin , leptin , ghrelin , PYY , GLP-1 ) measure , first last day intervention , compare acute chronic metabolic effect diet . The analysis primary outcome base repeated measure longitudinal model methodology . This study offer unique opportunity explore extreme difference dietary composition , weight loss , affect component energy balance marker central appetite weight regulation . These result use design hypothesis-driven study identify mediator appetite weight regulation response dietary manipulation .</detailed_description>
