	<detailed_description>'Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ventricular fibrillation common sustain arrhythmias . The patient give intravenous contrast dye hold breath 15 second picture take . The equipment use take picture like arch rotate around body . As arch rotates , collect picture heart . These picture use compute three-dimensional image heart . The physician continue plan procedure . The three-dimensional image reconstruct available doctor view case . The image also examine procedure physician.arrythmias heart , AF common affect 5 million people world wide . While drug first line therapy significant side effect often effective long term . AF ablation cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) emerge viable treatment option many patient . Both treatment require detailed knowledge anatomy heart instrument safely accurately navigate within heart treat condition . Detailed anatomical information limit 2D fluoroscopy 3D information preoperative compute tomography ( CT ) electroanatomical mapping inherent inaccuracy . 3D rotational angiography ( C-arm CT ) technology use x-ray detector system EP room create 3D image section heart , leave atrium , EP treatment room onset ablation procedure . There several potential advantage image technique ; As 3D image create start procedure well representation heart 's anatomy time data acquire day week earlier ; may eliminate need preoperative CT scan many patient ; C-arm CT expose patient low radiation dose regular cardiac CT scan ; , scan preform EP room physician opportunity perform secondary scan suspect anything changed procedure . The purpose research determine optimal image protocol heart structure need cardiac procedure AF CRT . The study vary several image parameter contrast injection site , total contrast inject , injection rate , image system setting data reconstruction parameter determine appropriate protocol .
