	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy aerobic exercise improve cognition , mood , fatigue Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) well examine role Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor ( BDNF ) peripheral Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) mediator response exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Aerobic Exercise Cognition , Mood Fatigue Following TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cognitive , emotional physical effect TBI well document literature . Specifically , reduce cognitive functioning depression , much prevalent general population , represent key challenge rehabilitation person recover TBI . Aerobic exercise show improve cognition mood general population . Although positive effect exercise know time , recently mechanisms underlying effect define . One hypothesize mechanism exercise elevate level BDNF VEGF CNS . Although research examine effect aerobic exercise individual TBI limit , exercise effective improve cognition depression individual medical condition , cancer , multiple sclerosis , fibromyalgia , dementia , chronic fatigue syndrome , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease elderly . The effect aerobic exercise patient TBI examine clinical trial , use crossover design wait-list control . The classic crossover design modify examine effect additional 8 week exercise , total 16-week intervention , one group . Participants randomize one two condition : Group A - immediate eight week intervention follow monitor Group B - monitoring follow 8 week intervention . In addition , participant Group B serve control determine another 8 week exercise , total 16 week , necessary cognitive improvement . Each person undergo individual interview testing/ questionnaire aim measure cognition , mood , fatigue , life satisfaction . Blood draw 2 3 time monitor BDNF VEGF level . Assessment cognition , mood , fatigue life satisfaction occur four time point group . It hypothesize aerobic exercise result improve cognition mood subjective objective perspective . In addition , explore effect post-TBI exercise community participation life satisfaction explore personal injury characteristic mediate effectiveness aerobic exercise individual TBI .</detailed_description>
