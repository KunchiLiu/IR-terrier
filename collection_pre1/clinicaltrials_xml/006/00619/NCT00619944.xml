	<brief_summary>With roll antiretroviral therapy ( ARV ) HIV across sub-Saharan Africa unprecedented number people commence lifelong therapy . Current estimate 5-6 million people sub-Saharan Africa require ART . At time , World Health Organization ( WHO ) Roll Back Malaria campaign aggressively promote use artemether/lumefantrine first-line therapy malaria set . Many patient set already become resistant first-line ARV move onto lopinavir/ritonavir ( Kaletra ) base second-line regimen . Kaletra potent inhibitor Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) , enzyme responsible metabolism many drug find predominantly liver gut . Lumefantrine , less extent artemether , extensively metabolize CYP 3A4 . Therefore give patient already take Kaletra HIV , likely elevate level drug patient result . There concern lumefantrine may cardiotoxic due structural similarity halofantrine know cause irregular heart rhythm . This borne yet study perform lumefantrine , however know level achieve patient administered protease inhibitor Kaletra . The WHO address issue previous policy document identify ARV-antimalarial drug interaction study research priority . This single dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study aim compare level lumefantrine/artemether result give patient Kaletra patient ARV . Data generate study help address important knowledge gap identify WHO others merit urgent investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study Between Lumefantrine Lopinavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2004 estimate 40 million people live HIV , 95 % live developing world . It estimate 5-6 million require antiretroviral therapy ( ARV ) , number continue rise . At recent G8 summit Gleneagles , Scotland , unanimous commitment Universal Access ARV 2010 make . This result unprecedented number individual , predominantly develop world , commence lifelong therapy ARV . Currently recommend second-line therapy ARV combination two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) . The widely recommend PI time sub-Saharan Africa Kaletra ( Abbott Laboratories ) combination lopinavir , PI , ritonavir , PI potent enzyme inhibitor act pharmacokinetic enhancer lopinavir . Although Kaletra highly effective treatment HIV , drug significant potential drug-drug interaction . These largely due ritonavir 's , lesser extent lopinavir 's , potent inhibition Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) , result dramatically raise level co-administered drug metabolise route . Unfortunately people also constant victim malaria pandemic . There least 300 million acute case malaria year globally , result million death , 90 % occur Africa . Increasing resistance anti-malarials chloroquine , amodiaquine , fansidar , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) East West Africa lead WHO recommend artemether-lumefantrine ( Coartem - Novartis ) first-line therapy malaria adult child . By 2004 , fourteen country sub-Saharan Africa adopt official policy , WHO apply pressure rest follow part Roll Back Malaria Campaign . The WHO 's recommendation however make specific reference use artemether-lumefantrine HIV positive patient , particularly patient treat ARV , although 's document `` Malaria HIV/AIDS Interactions Implications : Conclusions Technical Consultation Convened WHO , 23-25 June , 2004 '' state `` additional research interaction antiretroviral antimalarial drug urgently need . '' Coartem already use sub-Saharan Africa treatment malaria HIV-positive individual ARV , trend likely continue give lack explicit guideline concomitant administration . Lumefantrine artemether extensively metabolize CYP 3A4 . To date , data exist regard potential interaction drug PI . This give rise concern , particular case lumefantrine , patient administer drug concurrently likely elevated lumefantrine level potential associate toxicity . Lumefantrine , unlike predecessor halofantrine , seem prolong QT interval ( lead adverse cardiac event ) , however data regard potential adverse event administer PI . Given unknown potential interaction co-administered PI , association massive roll occur drug across sub-Saharan Africa concomitant use patient , essential issue address inform policy matter urgency . Preliminary supportive data : Artemether metabolize via CYP 3A4 dihydroartemisinin ( although compound antimalarial activity , dihydroartemisinin great potency ) . Inhibition CYP 3A4 would reduce dihydroartemisinin increase artemether potentially increase short half-life artemether ( 1 - 2 hour ) . The effect PI NNRTI unclear . Lumefantrine halofantrine extensively metabolize CYP 3A4 . Inhibition halofantrine metabolism could potentially prolong QT interval ; give narrow therapeutic index drug , combination PI contraindicate NVP EFV use caution . Lumefantrine seem prolong QT interval much safe halofantrine . In single-dose study combination ketoconazole , potent inhibitor CYP 3A4 , lumefantrine Cmax AUC double clinically significant QT effect note . Nevertheless , Novartis Drug Monograph Coartem list CYP 3A4 inhibitor , include Ketoconazole PI , precautions/contraindications , despite state document `` dose adjustment coartemether appear unnecessary administer association ketoconazole another potent inhibitor CYP 3A4 activity . '' No study however exist literature list product monograph address important potential interaction PI . The WHO recent editorial AIDS identify urgent need interaction data state study prioritize address gap knowledge . Currently practice , coartem administer patient sub-Saharan Africa WHO policy guideline address issue . Significance study : As outline background , study urgent public health importance develop world ARV anti-malarials use concomitantly . There increase number HIV patient Uganda move second-line therapy Kaletra already treat coartem afford . The consequence prescribe drug concomitantly elucidate . The WHO make recommendation guide treatment situation study data available guide policy . Data generate study would help address important gap identify WHO others merit urgent investigation . Hypothesis : That administration lumefantrine artemether-containing antimalarial combination therapy ( Coartem ) HIV-positive patient receive lopinavir/ritonavir ( Kaletra ) result increase exposure lumefantrine and/or artemether thus put patient increase risk toxicity drug .</detailed_description>
