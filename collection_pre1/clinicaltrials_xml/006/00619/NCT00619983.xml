	<brief_title>Three Way Interaction Between Gabapentin , Duloxetine , Donepezil Patients With Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain complex likely heterogeneous disorder , recognize clinically useful agent opioids , gabapentin , antidepressant may effective precisely multiple mechanism action multiple site . This study , however , provide important mechanistic information regard one cascade manipulate analgesia , also provide much need systematic practical guidance multi-drug therapy patient neuropathic pain . This study patient diabetic neuropathic pain patient fail low back syndrome , culminate quantitative description interaction activator descend noradrenergic activity , norepinephrine transporter inhibitor , cholinesterase inhibitor exploit plasticity analgesia chronic pain state . We focus practical application , use clinically approve drug , include gabapentin ( Neurontin® ) activate noradrenergic activity , duloxetine ( Cymbalta® ) inhibit norepinephrine transporter , donepezil ( Aricept® ) , approve treatment Alzheimer 's dementia , previously test treat neuropathic pain , inhibit cholinesterase . After baseline measurement physical examination patient train use Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA ) answer question diabetic neuropathic pain chronic back pain . Upon successful completion task patient randomize receive one drug choice placebo ( inactive pill ) . The study last total 16 week include 5 visit research center visit last approximately 2 hour .</detailed_description>
