	<brief_title>Nebulized Hypertonic Saline Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis common viral respiratory infection young child infant . It responsible hundred thousand outpatient visit hospitalization every year . Hypertonic saline may decrease swell lung tissue , improve patient 's ability clear secretion , decrease nasal congestion . Hypertonic saline nebulizations already use effectively patient cystic fibrosis small trial infant bronchiolitis . Patients come emergency department inpatient ward two urban free-standing pediatric hospital California December April diagnose bronchiolitis randomize two groups- control group receive nebulized 0.9 % normal saline , study group receive nebulized 3 % hypertonic saline . Nebulizations pretreated albuterol , prevent theoretical risk increase wheeze patient undiagnosed underlying asthma . Patients give 3 nebulizations emergency department , time attend physician decide whether admission hospital require . Patients admit continue receive nebulized treatment every 8 hour discharge . Additional intervention epinephrine treatment antibiotic order indicated patient care team . Investigators measure symptom severity treatment use respiratory distress assessment instrument ( RDAI ) . The investigator compare rate admit hospital group . The investigator also compare RDAI score , average length stay , number additional respiratory treatment need , number hour require oxygen , amount IV fluid need , frequency adverse effect . The investigator hypothesize nebulized hypertonic saline safe , cost-effective , efficacious therapy utilized outpatient set prevent hospital admission , well decrease length stay patient require admission . Given significant disease burden viral bronchiolitis , potential impact substantial .</detailed_description>
