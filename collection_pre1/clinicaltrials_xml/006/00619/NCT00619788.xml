	<brief_summary>This investigation design demonstrate efficacy safety 4.0-5.0mm AngioSculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter ( AngioScore , Inc. ) femoropopliteal use control clinical investigation . The score balloon semi-compliant balloon encircle 3 spiral strut nitinol score element , theoretically provide targeted score lesion , concentrate dilation force thus minimize barotrauma , elastic recoil uncontrolled dissection . This may improve outcome intervention reduce number stent require .</brief_summary>
