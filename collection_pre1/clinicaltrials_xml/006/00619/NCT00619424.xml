	<brief_summary>This open-label , two-arm , Phase I , dose escalation study evaluate safety tolerability determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pazopanib combination erlotinib ( Arm A ) pazopanib combination pemetrexed ( Arm B ) patient advance solid tumor . Patients enrol cohort 3 ( arm ) receive escalate dos pazopanib erlotinib pazopanib pemetrexed . Dose escalation schema study arm describe protocol . For arm , MTD regimen define high dose combination agent one six patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Six twelve additional patient arm study MTD regimen evaluate toxicity pharmacokinetics . In arm A ( erlotinib ) , run-in phase drug separately allow evaluation pharmacokinetics drug separately also two drug combination . This allow assessment potential drug-drug interaction . Pharmacokinetic endpoint AUC , Cmax , tmax t1/2 pazopanib , erlotinib , pemetrexed , well pemetrexed clearance administration pazopanib extension cohort Arm B. Antitumor activity assess use RECIST criterion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject consider eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance study specific procedure assessment , must willing comply treatment follow . ·Procedures conduct part routine clinical management subject ( e.g. , blood count , image study ) obtain prior sign inform consent may utilize Screening Baseline purpose provide test obtain specify protocol . Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis advance solid tumor fail standard therapy standard therapy . Subjects erlotinib pemetrexed standard therapy may also enter . Age ≥18 year . ECOG Performance status must ≤1 . Adequate organ system function define Table 9 .
