	<brief_summary>Myasthenia gravis disease happen immune system attack nervous system . The damage cause antibody produce B lymphocyte . These antibody damage special part muscle help transmit impulse nerve muscle allow muscle work properly . This damage result symptom myasthenia gravis . Participants ask participate research study myasthenia gravis either fail respond treatment commonly use disease , bad side-effects treatment . This research study drug call Rituximab . Rituximab , also call Rituxan , mouse antibody change make similar human antibody . Antibodies proteins protect body foreign invader , bacteria virus , bind substance call antigen . Rituxan work bind protein , call CD20 protein . Rituxan help destroy white blood cell produce antibody body , call B-lymphocytes . It treatment give vein participant 's arm period approximately 4-6 hour . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient form cancer lymph gland call Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . Rituximab approve myasthenia gravis . Treatment Rituximab try research study Rituximab decrease B lymphocyte . There preliminary evidence Rituximab help patient chronic otherwise difficult treat myasthenia gravis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Rituxan Refractory Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myasthenia gravis ( MG ) immune-mediated disorder neuromuscular junction diagnose basis clinical , electrophysiological serological feature . Cyclosporine disease-modifying therapy effective control study ; corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent azathioprine cyclophosphamide , plasmapheresis intravenous human immune globulin show benefit uncontrolled trial . There several drawback currently use medical treatment , include serious debilitate side-effects , prohibitive cost , need continuous periodical treatment . Almost 20-25 % patient MG unresponsive commonly used therapy , result significant burden economic loss . Rituximab chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody produce substantial reduction circulate plasma cell ( CD19+ ) B cell ( CD20+ ) provide targeted therapy B-cell lymphoma . Recently , rituximab find effective several antibody-mediated autoimmune process , include immune thrombocytopenia , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , IgM-related polyneuropathies . There preliminary evidence literature treatment MG patient rituximab likely benefit . These observation would strongly suggest rituximab might benefit refractory MG need study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria patient selection base upon recent recommendation clinical research standard Task Force Medical Scientific Advisory Board Myasthenia Gravis Foundation America ( Jaretzki et al , 2000 ) . Patients include trial base upon fulfil criterion give , except require fulfill criterion 3 OR 4 : 1 . Patients must diagnosis `` Definite '' MG ( Seybold , 1999 ) base clinical , electrophysiological serological criterion ( Appendix 1 ) 2 . Patients must disease predominantly affect bulbar respiratory muscle moderate severe degree ( Osserman grade 2B , 3 without crisis , 4 without crisis ) ( Osserman Genkins , 1971 Appendix 2 ) list Appendix 3 , Quantitative MG score &lt; 25 ( Appendix 7 ) 3 . Patients must disease refractory treatment least 12 month prednisone dose 15mg/day and/or immunosuppressive drug ( azathioprine cyclophosphamide dose 100mg/day cyclosporine dose produce trough level &gt; 50 ) , without thymectomy plasmapheresis/IVIG alone combination drug interval every 3 week , OR 4 . Patients must experience intolerance unacceptable sideeffects follow treatment corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ( azathioprine , cyclophosphamide cyclosporine ) , plasmapheresis IVIG 5 . Patients must 18 year 80 year old 6 . Patients must adequate organ function / laboratory parameter measure follow criterion ( value obtain within 2 week prior enrollment ) : Documented CD20 + cell Absolute neutrophil count : &gt; 2000/mm3 Platelets : &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin : &gt; 10 gm/dL Adequate renal function indicate normal BUN creatinine level Adequate liver function , indicate AST ALT &lt; 2x Upper Limit normal . Normal serum electrolytes 7 . Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control treatment one year completion treatment 8 . Written informed consent . Patients exclude trial base follow criterion : 1 . Myasthenic crisis force vital capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 30 % predict , irrespective need respiratory support , severe bulbar involvement ( Appendix 3 ) 2 . Patients require maintenance plasmapheresis IVIG infusion interval less every three week 3 . Patients require respiratory support invasive noninvasive ventilation 4 . Severe , uncontrolled untreated concomitant cardiac ( New York Heart Classification III IV disease ) , hepatic , pulmonary , renal , hematologic psychiatric disease 5 . Toxicity grade 2 prior treatment rituximab patient fail prior treatment 6 . Patients unwilling attend followup visit accord study design 7 . Patients exclude base follow criterion : History HIV disease Active Hepatitis B infection Pregnancy ( serum pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential immediately treatment ) Active infection 8 . Pregnant breastfeed woman may participate due lack information effect rituximab fetus develop child 9 . Concomitant malignancy previous malignancy within last 5 year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . 10 . No prior monoclonal antibody therapy . 11 . History significant psychiatric disease interfere consent procedure , research visit , treatment protocol evaluation patient study .</criteria>
