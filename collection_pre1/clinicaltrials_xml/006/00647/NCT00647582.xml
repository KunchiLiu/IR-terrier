	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy During After Lumpectomy Treating Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine feasibility acute tolerability intraoperative electron radiotherapy ( IOERT ) external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) lumpectomy woman stage I II breast cancer treat breast conservation therapy . - To determine local tumor control distant tumor control rate patient . - To determine long-term side effect cosmetic outcome IOERT tumor bed EBRT lumpectomy patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo standard lumpectomy . Patients negative lymph node undergo intraoperative electron radiotherapy tumor bed . Beginning 2-8 week surgery , patient undergo whole breast external beam radiotherapy daily 24-27 fraction . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 8 year .</detailed_description>
