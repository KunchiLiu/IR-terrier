	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective without panitumumab treat patient colon cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give fluorouracil together oxaliplatin panitumumab see well work compare give fluorouracil oxaliplatin without panitumumab treat patient high-risk colon cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil Oxaliplatin With Without Panitumumab In Treating Patients With High-Risk Colon Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine neoadjuvant chemotherapy without panitumumab follow deferred surgery completion chemotherapy postoperatively reduce 2-year recurrence compare surgery postoperative chemotherapy without panitumumab . - To determine add panitumumab neoadjuvant treatment produce measurable increase antitumor efficacy measure tumor shrinkage . Secondary - To assess accuracy pre-treatment CT scan staging . - To assess tolerability neoadjuvant therapy . - To assess nature frequency surgical complication . - To measure impact treatment quality life resource usage . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 50 year v 50-59 year v 60-69 year vs ≥ 70 year ) , radiological T-stage ( T3 v T4 ) , radiological nodal status ( Nx vs N0 v N1 v N2 ) , site primary tumor , propose chemotherapy ( OxMdG v OxCap ) , defunctioning colostomy ( yes v ) . Patients receive 1 2 follow treatment regimen : - OxMdG : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV folinic acid IV 2 hour follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 1 course . - OxCap : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 1 course . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Neoadjuvant therapy : - Arm I : Patients receive 1 follow chemotherapy regimen : - OxMdG : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - OxCap : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive 1 follow regimen : - OxMdG + panitumumab : Patients receive panitumumab IV 60 minute day 1 follow oxaliplatin IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - OxCap + panitumumab : Patients receive panitumumab IV 60 minute day 1 follow oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 52 day begin chemotherapy , patient arm proceed surgery . - Surgery : Patients arm undergo surgical resection primary tumor . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning 4-8 week completion surgery , patient receive adjuvant treatment arm receive neoadjuvant therapy . - Arm I : Patients receive either nine 2-week course OxMdG therapy six 3-week course OxCap therapy . - Arm II : Patients receive twelve 2-week course OxMdG therapy concurrently panitumumab give every 2 week OR eight 3-week course OxCap therapy concurrently panitumumab give every 3 week . Tumor tissue collect surgery blood sample collect periodically biomarker study . Samples analyzed detection k-ras mutation ; detection EGFR expression and/or functional genetic polymorphism EGFR gene via PCR ; detection copy number EGFR gene amplification via fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; detection EGFR activation via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; detection EGFR downstream parameter via western blot and/or gene expression microarray technique ; proteomics ; epigenetics . Patients complete quality life questionnaire baseline , first course postoperative chemotherapy , 1 year follow randomization . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
