	<detailed_description>Aortic valve stenosis ( AS ) common valvular disease second common indication cardiac surgery Western country . AS long consider passive degenerative process . Recent data challenge concept , show AS active highly regulated process similarity atherosclerosis . However , pathophysiology AS remain poorly understood preliminary data suggest genetic factor may involve . The aim present study identify genetic factor involve disease use case control trial design ( 1000 patient AS 1500 control evidence valve disease ) . For patient control , blood sample include DNA echocardiography perform .</detailed_description>
