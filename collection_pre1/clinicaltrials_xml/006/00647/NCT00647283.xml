	<brief_summary>In liver transplantation 20 % recipient completely discontinue immunosuppressive therapy maintain normal graft function , conventionally consider operationally tolerant . Discontinuation immunosuppressive drug operationally tolerant recipient could lessen side effect chronic immunosuppressive therapy . However , strategy result development rejection high proportion recipient require lifelong immunosuppression . Thus , need identify predictive factor successful drug withdrawal define clinical histological outcome operationally tolerant liver recipient . The main objective study establish safety attempt immunosuppressive ( IS ) drug withdrawal stable liver transplant recipient , use standard clinical , biological histopathological method , screen follow-up patient , confirm benefit maintain immunosuppressive drug interruption patient tolerant liver transplant . The secondary objective study identify predictive factor operational tolerance attempt develop multi-parameter `` decision rule '' predict patient tolerance non-tolerance order improve patient screen follow-up . In diagnostic observational sub-study , peripheral blood liver tissue sample collect immunosuppressive drug withdrawal employ validate diagnostic accuracy previously identify set tolerance biomarkers identify potential new biomarkers capable predict outcome immunosuppressive withdrawal protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Of Safety Benefit Prospective Immunosuppressive Drug Withdrawal Liver Transplantation Prediction Operational Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . This prospective study liver transplant recipient maintenance immunosuppression ( IS ) undergo carefully supervise IS wean period approximately 6-9 month . Patients gather consortium European liver transplant unit include : Hospital Clínic Barcelona ( Dr A. Sánchez-Fueyo ) , University Tor Vergata Rome ( Dr G.Tisone ) , University Hospitals Leuven ( Dr J.Pirenne ) . Patients followed-up total 48 month inclusion . 2 . Patients visit every 2-3 week , immunosuppressive drug gradually discontinue aim achieve 50 % decrease drug dosage month 3 , complete withdrawal month 6 initiation study . Following drug discontinuation , patient continue follow every 2-3 week 3 month , monthly thereafter month 12 initiation study . Liver function test obtain every clinical follow-up visit . Patients consider operationally tolerant rejection take place wean procedure 12-month period complete drug discontinuation . All patient fail completely discontinue IS , drug reintroduce period complete withdrawal , consider IS-dependent non-tolerant . All biopsy blindly review end study single pathologist ensure diagnostic consistency two institution . 3 . Management liver function test alteration : - Increases liver function test 2-fold normal level AST/ALT/GGT , 1.5-fold normal level ALP , 2 mgIdL bilirubin result decrease drug dosage , performance new liver function test 14 day . Worsening persistence liver function test alteration constitute indication liver biopsy . - Increases liver function test beyond 2-fold normal level AST/ALT/GGT , 1.5-fold normal level ALP , 2 mg/dL bilirubin result liver biopsy . 4 . Diagnosis liver graft rejection : base find 2 3 follow histological criterion : portal inflammation , injury bile duct epithelium , endothelitis . The finding mixed portal/lobular lymphocytic infiltrate attributable cause respond increase immunosuppressive drug dos also consider rejection . 5 . Management rejection episode : Specific therapy decide corresponding clinician/institution . Patients undergo graft rejection finalize participation study . Worsening HCV hepatitis appearance portal/lobular inflammation attributable rejection viral etiology may also justify withdrawal study accord institution 's experience . 6 . Peripheral blood sample collect wean start every time routine liver function test measure . These sample employ conduct microarray gene expression experiment . A portion liver biopsy collect also cryopreserved conduct gene expression analysis . This experiment constitute basis observational sub-study ( describe different protocol ) entitle : `` Search immunological signature operational tolerance liver transplantation '' . 7 . Sample size estimate order able replicate microarray gene expression result obtain group compare tolerant non-tolerant recipient . In current project follow novel method recently propose Tibshirani et al . perform permutation-based analysis pilot microarray data obtain tolerant non-tolerant sample . According analysis , least 45 sample ( 20 % tolerant , 80 % non-tolerant ) require order able discriminate tolerant non-tolerant HCV-positive sample false discovery rate &lt; 0.05 . Based analysis , expect enrol total 80 patient order least 60 patient evaluable , randomly allocate training ( 45 patient ) test ( 15 patient ) set data analysis purpose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Liver transplantation perform nonautoimmune liver disease perform least 3 year IS wean . Absence acute and/or chronic rejection episodes 12 month wean . Basal liver biopsy without sign acute and/or chronic rejection . No evidence autoimmune liver disease . Absence acute and/or chronic rejection episodes 12 month wean . Basal liver biopsy without sign acute and/or chronic rejection . Low dose immunosuppression ( monotherapy calcineurin inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor mycophenolate mofetil , combine therapy 2 drug low dos ) . Absence medical psychological disturbance preclude safe performance trial . Stability liver graft function , define : normal liver function test ( AST , ALT , ALP , GGT ) least 6 month , , alternatively , minor alteration liver function test change previous 6 month ( AST/ALT &lt; 2 fold normal level ; ALP &lt; 1.5 fold normal level ; GGT &lt; 2 fold normal level ; bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL ) . Patients exhibit least one follow characteristic : ) severe side effect immunosuppressive drug ( diabetes , renal failure , hyperlipidemia , hypertension ) ; b ) risk neoplasm development define history previous nonhepatocarcinoma neoplasms history follow risk factor : tobacco alcohol consumption , age great 60 year ; c ) chronic liver disease due hepatitis C virus infection patient receive antiviral treatment .
