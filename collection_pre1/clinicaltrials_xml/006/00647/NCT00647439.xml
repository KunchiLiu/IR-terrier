	<brief_summary>This study identify gene associate inflammation degeneration retina ( membrane line back eye relay vision signal brain ) . It think many retinal condition due alter immune system base person gene function communicate . People 4 year age old retinal condition uveitis , age-related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy may eligible study . Healthy volunteer healthy people family member one condition also eligible . Patients inherited retinal degeneration exclude . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . Photographs inside eye may also take . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Blood draw genetic testing . Participants may also undergo one follow test : - Optical coherence tomography . This type photograph back eye measure thickness retina . - Fluorescein angiography indocyanine green angiography . Pictures eye blood vessel take use either fluorescein indocyanine green dye . The dye inject vein arm travel blood vessel eye . A camera take picture dye flow blood vessel . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) measure retinal function . The patient sits dark room 30 minute eyes patch . Then , small metal disk electrode tap forehead , eye patch remove , surface eye numb eye drop , contact lens place eye . The patient watch flash light . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project study epigenetic mechanism , inheritance ( Mendelian complex ) biomarkers Immune Mediated Eye Diseases , family many nationality ethnic background order identify gene , genetically mutate epigenetically regulate , cause immune mediate eye disease , pathophysiology act . Study Population : The number participant enrol logical upper limit , 1,000 next five year . Race , age sex match control , anonymous volunteer also need donate blood sample . The study consist ascertain individual family multiple individual , possible , affected immune mediate ocular disease . Design : These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmologic examination , indicate , additional non-investigational examination characterize ocular status . A blood sample collect individual immunophenotyped use Flow Cytometry . Serum isolate test serological marker . One sub-populations cell ( include limit CD4 plus CD8 plus T cell , B cell , CD14 plus monocyte , dendritic cell , NK cell , neutrophil granulocyte ) isolate . DNA , RNA chromatin may isolate gene expression profile epigenetic study . Association genetic epigenetic change ocular inflammatory disease patient family identify use one technique include limited DNA-seq , BS-seq , MeDIP-seq , ChIP-seq , RNA-seq , microarray , PCR , multicolor Flow Cytometry stain . DNA sample AREDS study , hold DCR/NEI Repository protocol ( 07-EI-0168 ) , also use analysis . If necessary , gene product blood sample characterize biochemically . Outcome Measures : Immunophenotyping , gene expression epigenetic change report use Statistical analysis perform use test ANOVA post-hoc test Fisher least significant difference test . Unless otherwise note , result present mean SEM . Biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect individualize specific assay</detailed_description>
