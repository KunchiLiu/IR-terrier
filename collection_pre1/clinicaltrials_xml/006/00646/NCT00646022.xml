	<brief_summary>This study evaluate member family history small bowel carcinoid cancer study natural history family member disease , determine way improve early detection perform surveillance risk without disease identify gene ( ) may cause tumor . Familial carcinoid tumor usually originate hormone-producing cell line small intestine cell digestive tract . The tumor slow-growing usually take many year cause symptom . It known tumor occur often family pass one generation next inherited gene . Members family , include sibling offspring two immediate blood relative small bowel carcinoid tumor eligible study . In case unaffected spouse family member diagnose carcinoid cancer also request participate donating sample blood . Participants undergo medical evaluation every 3 year 3- 5-day hospital stay NIH Clinical Center . All participant personal family medical history obtain undergo physical examination , blood urine test . People already small bowel carcinoid tumor risk develop carcinoid tumor follow procedure determine presence carcinoid tumor ( omit next two words- location ) spread area body : - Video Capsule Endoscopy : Visualization gastrointestinal tract ingest disposable , `` vitamin-pill sized '' video capsule camera light source . - CT chest abdomen pelvis oral IV contrast : X-ray examination chest , abdominal pelvis organ . - 18 FDOPA Positron emission tomography ( PET ) CT localization : Nuclear image scan look tumor activity . - MRI Liver contrast - determine disease spread liver - Gallium 68 PET/CT-limited individual residual tumor . - Clinical research blood work Should mid gut carcinoid tumor find every participant assist determine best course treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carcinoid tumor rare cause either nonspecific symptom . Therefore , patient carcinoid tumor often present late course illness already progression incurable state result metastatic disease . At present neither practical population screen test effective therapy hence 5 year survival rate low . Due rareness sporadic carcinoid tumor , large scale genetic analysis development sensitive specific diagnostic test successful . While kindred familial carcinoid tumor ascribable know genetic syndrome exceedingly rare , provide unique opportunity facilitate identification responsible gene mutation . In addition , mutate gene rare familial form may also underlie origin common sporadic occurrence carcinoid tumor . We propose study family least two know affect member carcinoid tumor . We aim diagnose patient early therefore potentially curable occult disease . Therefore , family member 50 % lifetime risk harbor carcinoid tumor undergo intensive diagnostic evaluation use biochemical , endoscopic image modality initial subsequent two year follow encounter . Early phenotypic assignment affect family member collection germline tumoral DNA multiple kindred also facilitate genetic analysis lead identity disease gene . Evaluation affect family member vary stage disease contribute understanding natural history carcinoid tumor relative utility variety diagnostic surveillance test . Hopefully , knowledge gain also applicable patient carcinoid tumor occur sporadically set familial cancer syndrome . There planned treatment patient exist newly diagnose primary metastatic carcinoid tumor . However , patient may evaluate consultation oncology surgery potential treatment service preexisting protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Adult patient ) present diagnosis small intestinal carcinoid tumor least one blood relation immediate distant family member document diagnosis either small intestinal , pulmonary gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor b ) diagnosis small intestinal carcinoid tumor least two immediate distant family member document diagnosis either small intestinal , pulmonary gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . This include family member patient carcinoid tumor even patient tumor unwilling participate long appropriate documentation confirm diagnosis carcinoid tumor affect family member . Adult patient unable provide informed consent whose wish suggest willing donate sample research purpose consider study enrollment . 2 . Unaffected spouse patient carcinoid tumor child . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Families multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) I , MEN II familial tumor syndrome Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome Neurofibomatosis know genetic predisposition noncarcinoid tumor well carcinoid tumor exclude study . 2 . Pregnancy , breastfeed . 3 . Anticoagulation , seizure , severe systemic disease sort , advance metastatic carcinoid may relative exclusion criterion prohibit full evaluation describe protocol design . However , medical condition absolutely exclude participation protocol . Participation protocol delineate evaluation procedure judge case case basis patient safety paramount consideration .</criteria>
