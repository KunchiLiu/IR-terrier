	<brief_summary>Key word : serum , pleural effusion , procalcitonin , pneumonia Pneumonia common cause pleural effusion ( range 2nd ) bacterial infection main etiology pneumonia . Procalcitonin , prohormone calcitonin , 116 amino-acid protein produce C-cell thyroid gland . During severe infection , procalcitonin probably produce extra-thyroid tissue concentration increase rapidly bacterial infection remain low viral infection . However , exact origin pathophysiological role procalcitonin sepsis clear marker infection , since localize infection infection systemic manifestation cause little increase procalcitonin level . This study focus assess value procalcitonin pleural effusion diagnosis , severity prognosis among community-acquired pneumonia pleural effusion , serum . 100 patient clinical pneumonia infection score six point diagnose community-acquired pneumonia prove pleural effusion chest sonography admission study prospectively . Serum effusion procalcitonin level measure initially 3 day later medical therapy . Bacterial pneumonia identify bacteria culture one three kind specimen , include blood , pleural effusion bronchoalveolar lavage . Then divide one hundred patient bacterial non-bacterial group . Finally , analyze demographic procalcitonin data serum pleural effusion two group compare difference severe mild response non-response bacterial community-acquired pneumonia statistically . The aim study verify whether procalcitonin level measure serum pleural effusion could serve predictor bacterial community-acquired pneumonia pleural effusion different level also indicative severity prognosis . We hope predictor pleural effusion sensitive specific serum could detectable localized bacterial infection .</brief_summary>
