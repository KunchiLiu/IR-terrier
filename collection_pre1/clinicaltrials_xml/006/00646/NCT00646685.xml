	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare incidence biliary complication ( bile leak stricture ) follow duct-to-duct roux-en-y biliary reconstruction right lobe live donor liver transplantation . Biliary complication much common right lobe live donor liver graft whole organ graft consider major limitation surgery . Two surgical technique currently use biliary reconstruction advantages/disadvantages . However , unclear technique lead few biliary complication . Retrospective study examine biliary complication rate may hamper factor surgeon 's bias inexperience particular technique . Therefore prospective randomize trial need .</detailed_description>
