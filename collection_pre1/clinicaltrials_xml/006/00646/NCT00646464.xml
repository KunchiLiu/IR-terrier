	<detailed_description>Computerized continuous performance test ( CPT ) consider `` gold standard '' diagnosis Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) widely use . This type test measure number correctly detect stimuli well response time . The diagnosis test base mainly visual performance . The available test market suffer high false negative error . In subgroups child error false positive . All raise question regard ability correctly diagnose ADHD . There also doubt regard validity test . From medical literature experience seem current test much third child fulfill DSM criterion ADHD escape detection . With expand knowledge regard neurobiological basis ADHD learn attention general property whole brain , involve several coordinate network . These network must orchestrate order perform normally three main domain attention = alertness , orientation executive function . This raise need well , accurate valid computerized test . This knowledge promote u stage recognize different type attention domain . We separate - visual attention , auditory attention , spatial attention , integrated attention , sustained attention , covert overt attention , work memory , ability integrate disintegrate attention , attention span , focus , impulsivity response time . Different people different `` subtypes '' ADHD . The individual separation ability focus specific difficulty influence diagnosis process treatment method . Our diagnosis test separate different attention ability provide parent specific diagnosis child way direct appropriate diagnosis treatment . Moreover , expect fall negative positive error negligible . The next phase - involve train exercise . It prove train improve attention . We also develop computerized training program child . This program base platform diagnosis test recommend train individual difficulty specific child . Other program already distribute market propose . The program focus improve general specific skill ignore ( focus ) specific need individual . They try improve work memory one aspect attention domain . Or , base improve visual-motor skill , skill improve regular computer game focus specific short range difficulty . In many child ADHD symptom sign due source . For improve work memory visual-motor skill change every day performance . Our program well since individually fit specific child difficulty cover wide range need . So , helpful large variety child different need .</detailed_description>
