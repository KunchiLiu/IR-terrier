	<brief_summary>Context : Upper body obese ( UBO ) subject likely develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) low body obese ( LBO ) lean . This may part cause great hepatic secretion very-low-density-lipoprotein-triglycerides ( VLDL-TG ) . Objective : To assess impact body composition insulin sensitivity basal VLDL-TG turnover woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Body composition important predictor obesity relate life-style disease . Thus , preferential accumulation adipose tissue abdominal region demonstrate associate great risk develop CVD insulin resistance accumulation lower body depot . The reason yet fully understood , indication upper body fat depot contain large lipolytically active adipocytes result excess hepatic delivery FFAs upper body obese individual . As several line experimental evidence well cross-sectional study demonstrate , elevated level FFAs affect cardiovascular system unfavourably likely major contributor insulin resistance . A prominent feature insulin resistance hypertriglyceridemia , primarily cause increased level very-low-density-lipoprotein ( VLDL ) -TG . Even though lipolysis subcutaneous adipose tissue account majority ( ~75 % ) FFAs deliver liver , conceivable excess release visceral adipocytes UBO individual impact VLDL-TG secretion . The reason two-sided : First , upon entry liver , FFAs reesterified form VLDL-TG subsequently secrete . Studies cell line well whole body investigation human demonstrate , perturbation FFA level may directly affect VLDL-TG output liver . Second , elevate level FFAs may induce hepatic insulin resistance result increase VLDL-TG output due loss inhibitory effect insulin VLDL-TG secretion . In theory , combination excess substrate availability couple unfavorable hormonal milieu ( hepatic insulin resistance ) could result increased VLDL-TG production UBO subject . A recent study Mittendorfer et . al . support notion , since weight loss UBO woman result decreased VLDL-TG production , presumably cause primarily decrease supply visceral fatty acid . Although finding previous study contradictory whether body fat distribution directly affect VLDL-TG clearance , vitro finding suggest regional difference lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) activity UBO LBO woman , VLDL-TG clearance could also modulate difference VLDL associate fatty acid oxidation . To knowledge , latter point previously address . The purpose study therefore investigate difference VLDL-TG kinetics woman different body composition phenotype . Our preliminary hypothesis UBO woman produce secrete great amount VLDL-TG low body obese ( LBO ) lean counterpart . We also hypothesize , peripheral clearance would similar group . Lastly , want investigate whether benevolent lipid profile see lean woman could part result efficient channel VLDL derive fatty acid towards oxidation .</detailed_description>
