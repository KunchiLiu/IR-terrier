	<brief_summary>Thyroid relate orbitopathy ( TRO ) autoimmune disease . Clinical feature include : orbital pressure pain , ocular soft tissue swell , muscle enlargement around eyeball , eyelid retraction bulge eye anteriorly orbit . In many case , cornea may become dry , result , corneal ulcer may form , become infected . In severe case , damage optic nerve occur secondary optic nerve compression enlarge muscle orbit . Inflammation soft tissue swell occurs 1st stage disease . Scar formation occur 2nd phase . The muscle nasal eyeball commonly involve . In many patient , intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) increase primary . IOP upgaze ( look ) increase . Goldmann applanation standard device measure IOP . It measure average IOP ( `` systolic '' , heart contract , diastolic IOP , heart relaxes ) . Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer new device measure IOP ocular pulse amplitude ( OPA ) difference diastolic IOP systolic IOP . The choroid vascular layer inside eyeball feed part retina ( retina like film non-digital camera ) . OPA suggestive choroidal blood flow . IOP measurement use Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer less influenced corneal thickness oppose Goldmann applanation measure high value thicker cornea . In current study interested measure relationship measurement take Goldmann applanation ( IOP ) take Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer ( IOP OPA ) . In addition , investigate effect orbital muscle enlargement IOP/OPA follow gaze position ( look ) .</brief_summary>
