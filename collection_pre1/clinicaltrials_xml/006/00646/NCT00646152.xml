	<brief_summary>This study examine safety experimental medication call Poly-ICLC , develop prevent reduce severity infection influenza virus acquire nose , mouth lung . The study divide two part , Poly-ICLC test different dose level . Healthy people 18 70 year age chronic medical problem may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Part I - Up 7 day Poly-ICLC administration : Medical history , physical examination blood test . - Day 1 : Nasal wash Poly-ICLC administration . A small amount salt water place front nose suction . Poly-ICLC squirt nostril , one , dose 0.25 , 0.5 1 mg. A small number subject give placebo ( solution active ingredient . ) Subjects observed clinic 30 minute treatment . - Day 2 : Subjects receive second nasal wash repeat blood test . They keep diary card 1 week , record drug side effect . - Day 5 : Subjects repeat blood test review diary card . The keep diary card another 3 week . - Day 12 : Subjects contact phone review diary card . - Day 28 : Subjects contact phone review diary card . Part II - Up 7 day Poly-ICLC administration : Medical history , physical examination blood test . - Day 1 : Nasal wash Poly-ICLC administration . Same Part I participants . - Day 3 : Subjects receive second dose medication observe 30 minute . - Day 4 : Subjects receive second nasal wash repeat blood test . They keep diary card 1 week , record drug side effect . - Day 7 : Subjects repeat blood test review diary card . The keep diary card another 3 week . - Day 14 : Subjects contact phone review diary card . - Day 28 : Subjects contact phone review diary card .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Poly-ICLC Prevent Respiratory Viral Infections A Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic acid stabilize polylysine carboxymethylcellulose ( Poly-ICLC ) , stabilize double strand RNA ( dsRNA ) therapeutic viral mimic activate innate adaptive immunity , extensive preclinical investigational clinical therapeutic use intramuscular intravenous compound , recently oncology application . Only recently mechanisms action fully elucidate , include induction interferon , cytokine , chemokines . Recognizing , infectious disease application pursue vitro animal model . Intranasal Poly-ICLC provide protection mortality animal model multiple highly pathogenic virus include influenza , severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( SARS ) , smallpox Ebola . As effect dependant know causative virus , effective compound could protective several unknown respiratory virus significant clinical appeal . While clinical safety data intramuscular ( IM ) Poly-ICLC , clinical study nasal application Poly-ICLC do . This study phase I safety pharmacokinetic trial nasally apply Poly-ICLC . Human volunteer administer increase dos nasal Poly-ICLC , serial evaluation safety , tolerability , well exploratory marker immune activation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy volunteer age great equal 18 year less equal 70 year . For 2 month prior study drug administration , last day followup ( Day 28 ) , subject must agree : Not take topical nasal medication ( prescription counter ) . Not receive live attenuate influenza vaccine ( Flumist ) live attenuate intranasal vaccine ( license research ) . Not receive investigational medication vaccine . Females childbearing potential must agree use one follow method contraception 4 week prior date screen evaluation 4 week study drug administration : Be surgically sterile . Use oral contraceptive form hormonal birth control include hormonal vaginal ring transdermal patch . Use intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Use ( ensure male partner ( ) use ) barrier contraception ( condom ) spermicide . Any equivalent ( judged investigative team ) method contraception . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A medical history include follow : Any chronic medical problem require daily topical nasal medication . Prior nasal sinus surgery ( include transnasal approach organ pituitary ) . Allergic rhinitis , chronic sinusitis , nasal inflammatory disease require daily intranasal oral medication . Any chronic pulmonary condition include ( limited ) asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic bronchitis . Subjects know hypersensitivity interferon . Any medical history opinion investigator significantly increase risk associate Phase I drug ( e.g . Patients coronary heart disease , congestive heart failure , HIV , neuropsychiatric disorder , seizure disorder , autoimmune disease , hepatic decompensation , poorly control endocrine disorder ( include poorly control diabetes , actively hyper hypothyroid ) , hematological disorder ( e.g . leukopenia , thrombocytopenia ) , ophthalmologic disorder ( exclude error refractiveness ) disorder symptoms condition could similar interferonrelated toxicity might exacerbate interferon would exclude . Patients mild stable condition , control hypertension , control diabetes , osteoarthritis would permit enroll . ) Any history habitual intranasal cocaine intranasal recreational drug use time , experimental intranasal concaine intranasal recreational drug use within last 10 year . ( e.g . 50 year old tried cocaine age 20 acceptable enrollment ) . Women breastfeed . Positive urine serum pregnancy test . Participation research protocol require 100cc blood give 6week period time .</criteria>
