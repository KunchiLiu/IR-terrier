	<brief_summary>This research study investigate whether ability aspirin reduce risk heart attack may diminish administration acetaminophen . Patients heart disease often prescribe aspirin unique ability permanently prevent platelet aggregate form blood clot . Such blood clot cause heart attack form blood vessel supply heart oxygen rich blood . Some patient also take acetaminophen everyday relief arthritis pain . Higher dos acetaminophen may also ability prevent platelet clot , however temporarily . Therefore , study evaluate whether time administration acetaminophen ( aspirin ) interfere permanent blood clot effect aspirin . The primary hypothesis acetaminophen give two hour aspirin antagonize effect aspirin , reverse order administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Action Acetaminophen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetaminophen antipyretic moderate analgesic property , largely lack anti-inflammatory activity . While mechanism action entirely understood , probably isoform nonspecific partial cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibitor human dose commonly take mild pain pyrexia , 1000 mg . Although inhibition platelet aggregation observe dosage , platelet thromboxane formation COX depress roughly 40 % . Epidemiological study suggest high dos , 2000 mg , acetaminophen exhibit gastrointestinal adverse effect profile indistinguishable traditional , nonspecific NSAIDs . Thus , possible maximal COX inhibition achieve high dos . Interestingly , complete COX inhibition non-selective COX inhibitor potential antagonize irreversible platelet inhibition induce aspirin . In contrast reversible inhibitor , aspirin act acetylation serine residue substrate binding channel COX . For example , ibuprofen , reversible non-selective COX inhibitor , think prevent aspirin gain access target site . This study investigate , whether COX inhibition acetaminophen dose dependent human whether acetaminophen interacts irreversible COX inhibition low dose aspirin . It address dose-related effect acetaminophen COX activity assess potential pharmacological interaction low dose aspirin normal healthy volunteer . The primary hypothesis administrate acetaminophen aspirin would antagonize irreversible effect aspirin , assess measurement serum thromboxane B2 platelet aggregation 24 hr administration first study drug day 6 combination therapy . The second aim determine effect acetaminophen oxidant stress cyclooxygenase activity patient smoke . While structural interaction acetaminophen COX unknown , may inactivate enzyme molecular mechanism different NSAIDs . Thus , acetaminophen , good reducing agent , might act reduce COX active , oxidized form . When uninhibited , peroxidase component bifunctional enzyme oxidize catalytic center generate tyrosyl radical require activity . Indeed , reduce agent capacity prevent COX activation vitro . If reduction basis COX inhibition acetaminophen vivo , would expect less pronounced condition high peroxide tone , occur inflammation . Indeed , acetaminophen , phenol derivative , may act free radical scavenge antioxidant like phenolic compound , vitamin E show alleviate oxidative damage model system . This study explore potential antioxidant effect acetaminophen smoker . Such individual represent human model oxidant stress . Novel approach quantitative assessment free radical induce damage lipid apply , elevate smoker . Additionally , determine whether COX inhibition acetaminophen condition oxidant tone vivo . Part B : To develop validate method measure platelet COX-1 acetylation aspirin .</detailed_description>
