	<detailed_description>PROJECT TITLE : Assessment Cardiovascular Risk Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency Following Transsphenoidal Surgery Nonsecreting Pituitary Adenomas . BACKGROUND Recently , awareness risk hypopituitarism adult raise epidemiological study demonstrate association increase mortality , likely cardiovascular ( CV ) cause . In particular , untreated growth hormone deficiency implicate possible cause increase mortality . A 2004 clinical review growth hormone deficiency adult highlight plausibility argument cite study potentially link GHD follow : elevate CRP , LDL coagulation factor level , increase abdominal obesity , increase insulin resistance , increase prevalence structural functional heart disease increase rate endothelial cell large artery dysfunction . Furthermore , therapy GH deficiency show low total LDL cholesterol reduce visceral fat mass , reduce sign early atherosclerosis perhaps decrease overall risk myocardial infarction . While study suggest GHD important cardiovascular risk factor , believe data imperfect since study choose comparison group dissimilar ( allow possibility unrecognized confounding ) . Previous study assess cardiovascular risk patient hypopituitarism comparison general population much young GH replace subject GHD patient GH therapy . In contrast , plan compare cardiovascular risk among adult patient render growth hormone deficient follow surgery non secrete pituitary adenoma versus patient undergone surgery remain growth hormone sufficient . We plan test growth hormone deficiency use Arginine/GHRH stimulation test 80 subject . We divide patient two group : growth hormone deficient growth hormone sufficient . Once recruited enough patient group ( thirty ) , compare know CV risk marker endothelial function carefully match patient group . This approach allow u compare similar patient ( i.e . undergone surgery , group undergone radiation ) whose primary difference GH status . In addition , group identify patient additional pituitary deficiency hope compare patient either isolated GHD patient multiple endocrinopathies similar match control . At least two novel aspect study include use magnetic resonance spectroscopy measure intramyocellular intrahepatic lipid venous endothelial cell biopsy assess endothelial function . Regarding first modality , elevate level intramyocellular intrahepatic lipid associate insulin resistance population . It hypothesis subtle abnormality lipid store may correlate insulin resistance patient apparent occult GH deficiency . With regard endothelial function , previous work link GHD endothelial cell dysfunction typically indirect measure include serum marker arterial flow mediate dilatation . However , technique recently develop safely sample venous endothelial cell turn enable u assess directly level endothelial cell , oxidative stress , cell activation nitric oxide synthesis . It belief new method help confirm contention GHD alters basic function endothelial cell . STUDY DESIGN This study assess level cardiovascular risk two patient population : patient GHD follow transsphenoidal surgery nonsecreting pituitary adenoma patient GHD follow similar surgery . The primary outcome serum marker cardiovascular risk include lipid , CRP , IL6 homocysteine . Experimental Protocol : Subjects study undergone transsphenoidal surgery nonsecreting pituitary adenoma . In addition , may additional subject , also undergone transsphenoidal surgery nonsecreting pituitary adenoma , recruit word mouth cohort patient describe . Only patient receive GH therapy consider . Of patient receive RT , least 5 year radiotherapy recruit order lessen likelihood false positive Arginine/GHRH stimulation test occur early year post RT . The remain respondent stratify two group base presence absence history hypopituitarism : 1 ) &gt; 1 know pituitary hormone deficiency ( GH ) replacement 2 ) know pituitary hormone deficit . The status pituitary hormone replacement therapy verify prior arrival subject test . Patients need stable dos replacement therapy least 3 month prior study visit hormone replacement must hydrocortisone &lt; 30 mg/day equivalent physiological dos thyroid sex steroid replacement . If possible , patient ask provide copy recent endocrine study available chart review verify adequacy replacement therapy . Any woman know pregnant woman childbearing age positive urinary HCG consider study ( screen woman childbearing age first visit prior initiation test ) . In addition , woman actively nursing include study ( ask woman childbearing age first visit ) . We recruit equal number two group , invite subject Neuroendocrine Unit initial visit undergo clinical exam vital sign , anthropometric measurement skin fold thickness assessment . Subjects also undergo GH stimulation test Arginine/GHRH identify GH deficient ( peak GH &lt; 4 µg/L ) nonGH de•cient ( peak GH &gt; 10 µg/L ) group . Lastly , subject endothelial cell biopsy perform . Thirty match pairs patient GHD GH sufficient group contact additional visit unit follow test : - Fasting blood sample CV risk marker include CRP , homocysteine , lipoproteins , IL6 IGFI IGFBP3 ( subject , n=30 pair ) - 75 gm OGTT ; Insulin glucose ( subject , n=30 pair ) - DEXA scan ass body composition bone density ( subject , n=30 pair ) - Ultrasound ass carotid intimal medial thickness brachial artery flowmediated dilatation ( subset subject , n=10 pair ) . - Magnetic resonance spectroscopy assessment intramyocellular lipid intrahepatic lipid subset group cohort ( subset subject , n=10 pair ) . Subjects study within 6 month initial GH stimulation test . STUDY DRUGS Subjects undergo Arginine/GHRH stimulation test . They receive Rgene ( Upjohn ) 10 % Arginine Hydrochloride solution water Geref Diagnostic ( Serono ) . STUDY SUBJECTS Subjects study include adult patient undergone transsphenoidal pituitary surgery nonsecreting pituitary adenoma . STUDY LOCATION This study take place Neuroendocrine Unit , Columbia University . POTENTIAL RISKS Participation study involve minimal standard risk associate blood draw . In addition potential risk exposure radiation DEXA scan . However , amount radiation exposure DEXA scan one percent chest xray accordance federal guideline type research . Given risk pose fetus radiation exposure , pregnant nursing mother exclude study . To assess pregnancy chec urine HCG woman childbearing age prior initiate test . In addition , woman childbearing age ask actively nurse exclude study . Since risk pregnant nursing mother present time test , additional precaution pregnancy need take day follow test . Ultrasound ( IMT flow mediate dilatation study ) pose minimal risk beyond mild discomfort gel probe . MRI also pose minimal risk beyond mild discomfort enclose space noise machine long metal within scanner room . The subject ask series question MRI technician ensure safe proceed MRI . In addition , pregnant woman undergo MRI . The risk endothelial biopsy think include pain , inflammation , infection clot . In previous study find safe patient ask return one week biopsy evaluation site . If symptom arise prior one week follow patient advise call proceed emergency room . The common adverse reaction administration arginine include nausea , vomit , headache , flushing , numbness , local venous irritation . Systemic allergic reaction rare patient highly allergic tendency include . Pregnant nursing subject also exclude mention . For GHRH , common side effect include transient warmth/flushing face , injection site pain , redness/swelling site injection , nausea , headache , vomit , strange taste mouth , paleness , tightness chest . A physician present throughout administration two drug . POTENTIAL BENEFITS The result growth hormone stimulation test make available subject doctor . Therefore , subject find growth hormone deficient , might benefit growth hormone therapy show , study , improve body composition , cholesterol level factor associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . A decision initiate therapy , however occur careful discussion subject personal physician occur . There may also benefit DEXA scan might identify previously undiagnosed osteoporosis . This condition effective treatment option . Lastly , participation study help contribute understanding risk heart disease growth hormone deficient patient .</detailed_description>
