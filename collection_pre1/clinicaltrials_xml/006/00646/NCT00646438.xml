	<brief_summary>Standard care patient diabetes CABG surgery Providence St. Vincent Medical Center include strict control blood sugar ( glucose ) level 3 day surgery . This do frequent monitoring blood sugar level give insulin continuously needle vein ( intravenously ) . This intensive glucose control result few complication serious infection death , shorten length hospital stay patient . This study treatment different standard treatment extend intensive glucose control beyond third postoperative day one full year . Once discharged hospital follow CABG procedure , intense glucose control do use subcutaneous insulin ( shot skin ) , oral medication , measure blood sugar level frequently . The purpose study see safe effective strict glucose control extend beyond 3 day hospital discharge one year . Another purpose see well patient comply daily management intensive glucose control one-year well study follow-up schedule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>United States Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( CABG ) Diabetes Project ( USCDP ) Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Pilot study gather information `` United States CABG Diabetes Project '' ( USCDP ) Multi-center Randomized Trial . For 14 year research team successfully implement increasingly aggressive series intravenous insulin protocol normalize blood glucose level 3 postoperative day patient diabetes undergo cardiac surgery . This result significant reduction mortality , infection length stay ( LOS ) normalize outcomes population without diabetes ( DM ) . The current protocol end morning 3rd postoperative day . We believe logical expansion groundbreaking work extend duration intensive glycemic control beyond third postoperative day outpatient period . However would impossible continue use CII therapy . Therefore , propose employ intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy oral hypoglycemic agent affect continue tight glycemic control follow discontinuation CII continue therapy beyond hospital discharge period least one year . We hypothesize lead reduction major adverse cardiac outcomes high-risk diabetes coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) subgroup . The optimal method test hypothesis large , multi-center clinical trial . However , embark resource-consuming endeavor , intend test concept , method , implementation strategy , patient acceptability compliance , propose biomarkers clinical outcome trial propose limited pilot study . If information obtain pilot study favorable , submit full funding multicenter USCDP clinical trial NIDDK NHLBI division NIH . In order test aspect propose trial , intend randomize patient pilot study .</detailed_description>
