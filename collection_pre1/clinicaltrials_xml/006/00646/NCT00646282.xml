	<brief_summary>Patients kidney failure dialysis successfully transplant . However , many attain normal kidney function and/or present slow deterioration kidney function transplantation . As consequence , develop endocrine disorder call hyperparathyroidism , cause bone disease high risk bone fracture . In spite know bone disease hyperparathyroidism , well define treatment patient . Moreover , kidney transplant recipient present high mortality rate compare general population , principal cause death cardiovascular disease . Dialysis patient know extensive cardiovascular calcification increase vascular stiffness , factor closely associate cardiovascular mortality . The effect vitamin D bone health well know general population . Many study show reduction fracture rate post-menopausal woman old men receive vitamin D calcium supplement . Vitamin D analogue also commonly use treat hyperparathyroidism dialysis patient . Finally , vitamin D suggest beneficial effect cardiovascular system reduce mortality dialysis patient . Hectorol® vitamin D analog demonstrate effectively treat hyperparathyroidism dialysis pre-dialysis patient . The effect vitamin D supplementation bone disease , hyperparathyroidism cardiovascular function kidney transplant recipient properly study . Whether Hectorol® therapy help reduce severity bone disease improve vascular function kidney transplant recipient still unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study cardiovascular bone effect Hectorol® 100 kidney transplant recipient . The kidney transplant patient screen kidney transplant dysfunction hyperparathyroidism . The study medication give 50 patient . The 50 patient continue treat actual standard care transplant clinic . Subjects follow 18 month laboratory value , bone density , vascular calcification stiffness collect see effect Hectorol® compare actual standard care .</detailed_description>
