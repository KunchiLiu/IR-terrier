	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high energy x- ray kill tumor cell . Cetuximab may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know regimen radiation therapy , combination chemotherapy , cetuximab effective treating patient head neck cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial compare two different regimen radiation therapy give together combination chemotherapy cetuximab see well work treat patient newly diagnose stage III stage IV head neck cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine safety profile chemoradiotherapy carboplatin v cisplatin patient newly diagnose , unresectable stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck . - To select one chemoradiotherapy regimens use experimental arm future phase III trial . - To look EGFR expression downstream signal react skin sample patient experience skin toxicity normal skin sample patient comparison skin sample patient show skin toxicity . - To explore factor relate EGFR predict biological activity cetuximab patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprise docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 week completion induction chemotherapy within 5 week start last chemotherapy course ( day 21 ) , patient stratify institution treatment response ( stable disease [ SD ] , partial response [ PR ] , complete response [ CR ] v non-response [ progressive disease ] ) . Patients progressive disease remove study patient SD , PR , CR randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy ( RT ) ( 3-dimensional conformal RT intensity-modulated RT ) day 1-5 weekly 7 week . Beginning day 1 RT , patient receive cisplatin IV 1 hour weekly 7 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo RT arm I . Beginning day 1 RT , patient receive carboplatin IV 1 hour weekly 7 week . Patients arm receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour weekly begin day 1 induction chemotherapy continue end concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Primary tumor tissue skin biopsy , include fix paraffin-embedded tissue specimens frozen tissue , collect baseline ( prior treatment ) completion study treatment correlative laboratory study EGFR expression downstream signal . Specimens assess immunohistochemistry , fluorescence situ hybridization , reverse transcriptase-PCR sequence gene proteins ErbB-related activation . In event skin toxicity treatment , patient undergo least two additional biopsy , one react skin one normal skin . Samples assess marker treatment efficacy relate cetuximab . After completion study therapy , patient follow 3 month periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
