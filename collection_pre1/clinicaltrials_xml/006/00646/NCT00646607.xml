	<brief_summary>This project consist two independent , follow specific eligibility criterion different randomisation scheme study , later call DURATION study BEV study . Once randomised duration study , patient fulfil eligibility criterion BEV study may also randomize receive BEV BEV , addition FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy . As open label study , blind treatment assignment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FOLFOX-4 3months Versus 6 Months Bevacizumab Adjuvant Therapy Patients With Stage II/III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present time standard treatment resect colon cancer high possibility relapse ( `` high risk '' stage II stage III ) represent regimen FOLFOX ( leucovorin , bolus infusional 5fluorouracil oxaliplatin ) , able increase significantly disease-free survival ( DFS ) 3 4 year , whereas advantage 5-year overall survival ( OS ) ( predict previous parameter ) could observe increase follow-up . The conventional duration chemotherapy today 6 month ( 12 course every 2 week ) , long drug exposure increase risk long-term neurotoxicity . A reduction adjuvant chemotherapy 6 month proven effective cancer ( breast , testisâ€¦ ) well tolerate patient clinical practice . On hand , bevacizumab significantly increase OS parameter combine standard chemotherapy advance disease .</detailed_description>
