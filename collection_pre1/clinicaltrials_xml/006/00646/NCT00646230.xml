	<brief_title>N2004-03 : Intravenous Fenretinide Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Resistant Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose fenretinide give continuous intravenous infusion young patient recurrent and/or resistant neuroblastoma . - To define toxicity drug patient . - To determine plasma pharmacokinetics drug patient . Secondary - To determine response rate patient treat drug . - To determine bioavailability fenretinide normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell surrogate marker drug bioavailability tumor tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive fenretinide IV continuously 120 hour day 0-4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic analysis high performance liquid chromatography . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
