	<brief_summary>Our primary aim determine whether muscle architecture quadriceps muscle cerebral palsy ( CP ) adapt two separate training program : traditional strength training ( ST ) vs. velocity-enhanced training ( VT ) . For ST group , hypothesize muscle size increase conjunction strength . For VT group , addition , hypothesize fiber length increase measure muscle power . We also hypothesize walk velocity improve group knee motion step length improve VT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common physical disability originate childhood , occur 2-3 per 1,000 live birth . Although primary deficit CP injury brain , secondary impairment affect muscle function weakness , contracture , spasticity often far debilitate lead worsening disability throughout lifespan . Some suggest muscle change CP may irreversible ; however , know muscle one 'plastic ' tissue body . In fact , recent evidence suggest gross muscle hypertrophy architectural change within muscle fiber occur early 3-5 week resistance training healthy adult . It also unknown effectively muscle CP adapt training stimulus target specific muscle architectural parameter , fascicle length cross-sectional area . These parameter observe decreased CP , suggest loss sarcomere in-series ( fiber shorten ) in-parallel ( muscle atrophy ) . We propose specific training-induced muscle architectural adaptation occur CP , lead improve motor function .</detailed_description>
