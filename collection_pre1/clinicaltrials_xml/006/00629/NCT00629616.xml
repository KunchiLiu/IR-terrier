	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use anastrozole fulvestrant may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make block use estrogen tumor cell . Giving hormone therapy surgery may effective treatment breast cancer . It yet know whether anastrozole effective fulvestrant give surgery treat woman breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study anastrozole see well work compare fulvestrant treat postmenopausal woman stage II stage III breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Anastrozole Fulvestrant Patients With ER Positive , HER2 Negative , Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare clinical response rate ( complete partial response ) 6 month postmenopausal woman operable stage II III breast cancer treat neoadjuvant anastrozole v fulvestrant . Secondary - To compare breast surgery conservation rate patient treat drug . - To correlate imaging finding mammography , ultrasonography , MRI histological clinical response patient sensitivity profile drug . - To compare histological response patient treat drug . - To define criterion appropriate neoadjuvant hormonal therapy . - To correlate baseline molecular characteristic modification treatment response patient . - To compare tolerability drug patient . - To compare serum proteomic profile patient treat drug . - To correlate 3-year event-free overall survival rate clinical histological response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral anastrozole daily 4-6 month absence clinical progression . - Arm II : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 , 15 , 29 first month every 28 day subsequent month . Treatment continue 4-6 month absence clinical progression . Patients arm undergo surgery radiotherapy accord institutional guideline . Patients receive adjuvant hormonal therapy least 5 year . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
