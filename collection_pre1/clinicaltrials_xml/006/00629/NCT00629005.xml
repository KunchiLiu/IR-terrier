	<brief_summary>People stroke experience weakness incoordination . Studies show functional task practice , people increase motor control strength certain extent . This study investigate whether add progressive resistance strength train functional task practice model Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy result great motor function gain functional task practice alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strength Training Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date investigation UE rehabilitation examine single intervention . However , combine 2 efficacious intervention may enhance effectiveness . Both functional task training strength train beneficial promoting improve upper extremity function , seldom study couple therapy . The research propose project examine effect UE function add UE resistive exercise functional task training . Secondary aim examine effect stroke severity response therapy , interrelationship therapy-induced neural change movement composition functional change therapy , test retention UE function gain 6 month . Individuals chronic hemiparesis stroke complete baseline test randomly assign either functional task + strength train group functional task train alone group . Each group train 4 hours/day , 3 days/week 4 week . Each perform 3 hour functional task training per session . The strengthen group complete 1 hour UE progressive resistance exercise functional task train alone group complete gravity eliminate range motion exercise 1 hour . All subject post-tested complete follow-up test 6 month later .</detailed_description>
