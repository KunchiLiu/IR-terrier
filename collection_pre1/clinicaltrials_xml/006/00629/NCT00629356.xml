	<detailed_description>The dengue fever important tropical infectious disease south Taiwan , cause threaten public health Kaohsiung Ping-Dong year , cause patient 's death , default clinical change dengue fever , acute infect , infect influence , host immunity adjust control , reciprocation virus hepatitis , urgent basic research . Originally test host 's understand track healthily immune change dengue fever Taiwan . Blood draw 20 c.c liver examination , kidney biochemical function , analyze host immunity adjust control gene , reciprocation may produce virus hepatitis , besides collect 10 c.c urine time . This plan expect collect 150 healthy , 150 dengue fever infect 150 dengue fever bleed hot dengue fever shock disease group 's patient , goal understand health state immunity follow-up adjust control difference gene reciprocation may produce virus hepatitis light disease serious disease . Urine check order compare acute infect infect three month person , change chemical composition . The result study help doctor understand factor immune regulation control host health change dengue fever infect , possible reciprocation virus hepatitis . Researchers collect 100 dengue fever bleed hot dengue fever shock syndrome group patient , estimate collect expect case count within two year .</detailed_description>
