	<detailed_description>MVA-BN®-PRO candidate prostate cancer immunotherapy product comprise highly attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus , MVA-BN® , engineer encode prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) prostate acid phosphatase ( PAP ) proteins . The MVA-BN®-based vaccine provide innate adaptive immune activate factor , vaccination strategy evaluate capacity help override self tumor tolerance mechanism . Previous work show PSA PAP antigens immunogenic human present immune stimulatory component . Multiple clinical study demonstrate promising activity PSA-targeted vaccinia-based immunotherapy . Additionally , PAP-based cellular therapy immunization approach , show promise Phase III clinical trial provide enhanced survival . The strategy undertaken BNIT combine antigens MVA-BN® vector enhance immunogenic effect help mitigate development tumor resistance . This trial examine three vaccination regimens MVA-BN®-PRO : Vaccine provide ( 0.5cc/dose/1x10e8 TCID50 ) - Cohort 1 : 1 sc injection every 4 week x 3 ; retreat dose schedule . - Cohort 2 : 2 sc injection every 4 week x 3 ; retreat dose schedule . - Cohort 3 : 4 sc injection every 4 week x 3 ; retreat dose schedule . These dose regimen base current dose MVA-BN® ( 1x10e8 TCID50 sc injection ) development prophylactic vaccine prevention smallpox , related clinical study MVA-nef-based vaccine ( 5x10e8 TCID50 ) induction heterologous immunity .</detailed_description>
