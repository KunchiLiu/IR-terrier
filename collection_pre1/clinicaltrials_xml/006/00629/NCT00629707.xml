	<detailed_description>Cerebral edema ( swell brain ) frequent serious complication diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) child . The cause cerebral edema DKA well understood . Recent study suggest may result lack adequate blood flow brain DKA , treatment start . Brain injury , result edema , may occur treatment lack adequate blood flow brain additional injury may occur adequate blood flow re-established treatment ( call reperfusion injury ) . Because additional injury may occur treatment , important understand whether rate administration intravenous fluid , , therefore , speed reperfusion brain , related degree brain swell injury . Most current treatment protocol indicate intravenous fluid administer slowly , may possible brain injury swell might lessen adequate blood flow establish quickly . In study , researcher use magnetic resonance ( MR ) image compare two different rate fluid administration DKA treatment child . The investigator use MR imaging measure brain swell metabolism three time points—twice treatment recovery DKA—and compare measurement determine fluid administration rate beneficial effect brain metabolism brain swelling . The study 's researcher hypothesize rapid re-establishment blood flow brain ( via rapid administration intravenous fluid ) result less brain swell injury slow rehydration delay re-establishment adequate brain blood flow .</detailed_description>
