	<detailed_description>This single center , Phase II study RAD001 men HRPC . The study design straight forward , two-stage design tumor biopsy schedule screen 4 week . FLT-PET scan perform screen day 28 , follow initiation treatment first 10 patient . Patients assessed adverse event every two week first month monthly thereafter . Patients assessed response PSA every 4 week applicable , objective response every 2 month . If 4 response see first 39 patient study expand 60 patient .</detailed_description>
