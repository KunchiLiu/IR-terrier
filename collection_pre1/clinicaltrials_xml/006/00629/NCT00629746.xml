	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS : The purpose study explore advantage application electrode use monitor recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) thyroid surgery . We want know monitoring system decrease rate recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy . STUDY DESIGN : One hundred patient undergo thyroid surgery collect study . Patients intubated general anesthesia Medtronic Xomed Nerve Integrity Monitor ( NIM ) EMG endotracheal tube ( Jacksonville , Fla ) 2 electrode imbed wall endotracheal tube . These wire place vocal cord . Two ground wire ( needle No . 26 ) place subcutaneous tissue shoulder . The electrode wire , ground wire , nerve stimulator connect monitoring device ( Medtronic NIM-Response ) recode visual evoked potential audible beep muscle contraction vocal cord . A Medtronic Xomed Prass monopolar nerve stimulator wand use test RLN intraoperatively set 0.5mA . Direct physical touch RLN nerve stimulator use pulsed current would produce audible `` beep-beep-beep '' . CONCLUSION : This study conduct cooperation Department anesthesiology . The following subject collect elucidate : 1 . If muscle relaxant use surgery affect operation RLN monitoring system . 2 . Can RLN monitoring system accurately identify RLN 3 . Can RLN monitoring system accurately predict function RLN 4 . Can RLN monitoring system decrease RLN palsy rate thyroidectomy 5 . Application RLN monitoring determine safety benefit vagal stimulation begin end thyroid operation 6 . Application RLN monitor determine whether extensive dissection RLN increase risk nerve injury . At least four paper write study topic following : 1 . Influence muscle relaxation neuromonitoring recurrent laryngeal nerve thyroid surgery 2 . Intraoperative neuromonitoring recurrent laryngeal nerve thyroid surgery : Plaudits pitfall 3 . Vagal stimulation intraoperative neuromonitoring recurrent laryngeal nerve thyroid operation . 4 . Does extensive dissection recurrent laryngeal nerve thyroid operation increase risk nerve injury ? Our experience application intraoperative neuromonitoring</detailed_description>
