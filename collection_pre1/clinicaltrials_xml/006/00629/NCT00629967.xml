	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate whether treatment peginterferon ribavirin 24 week sufficient achieve sustain virological response ( SVR ) rate comparable observed standard treatment duration 48 week , hepatitis C virus genotype 1 ( HCV-1 ) patient achieve rapid virologic response ( RVR ; &lt; 50 IU/mL HCV RNA week 4 ) 4 week . 2 . To investigate role on-treatment virological response among patient 24 48 week treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial 24-Week Versus 48-Week Courses Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin HCV Genotype-1 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peginterferon ribavirin combination treatment recommend patient infected HCV , treatment duration varies depend HCV genotype . Recommended treatment patient HCV-1 infection pegylated interferon plus ribavirin 48 week 24 week HCV-2/3 . A RVR strong predictor SVR . Previous study demonstrate HCV-2/3 patient RVR , short duration treatment peginterferon plus standard dose ribavirin 14 week effective 24-week treatment regimen . These finding question whether shorter treatment duration yield high SVR rate HCV-1 pt RVR . The primary aim present study evaluate whether treatment peginterferon ribavirin 24 week sufficient achieve SVR rate comparable observed standard treatment duration 48 week , HCV-1 patient achieve RVR 4 week . The secondary aim investigate role on-treatment virologic response among patient 24 48 week treatment .</detailed_description>
