	<brief_summary>Combination therapy pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin greatly improve treatment efficacy mainstream treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . The efficacy safety pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy impact outcome old patient chronic hepatitis C deserve elucidate . The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate efficacy pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy old patient chronic hepatitis C 2 . To investigate safety pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy old patient chronic hepatitis C</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Plus Ribavirin Treating Older Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , hospital-based , case-control study enrol 70 chronic hepatitis C patient 65 80 year age sex- HCV genotype-matched 140 chronic hepatitis C patient 50 64 year age conduct comparison . The 210 patient chronic hepatitis C patient receive pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy . Genotype 1 infected patient receive 48 week treatment genotype non-1 patient receive 24 week treatment . Another 40 HCV-1 infected patient 65-80 year age rapid virological response ( defined seronegative HCV RNA week 4 treatment ) receive 24 week treatment enrol comparison since Jan 2008 . The primary outcome measurement sustain virological response safety .</detailed_description>
