	<brief_title>Efficacy Electrical Stimulation Dysphagia Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer patient well chance survival 21st century radiation therapy ( RT ) , either alone combination surgery and/or chemotherapy ( CRT ) . Such therapy high rate local / regional control , may extend duration life . Unfortunately elimination cancer leave devastate side effect , include inability eat swallow normally . Organ preservation , often assume preferred treatment , show magnify dysphagia . Incidence dysphagia group patient extremely high , symptom continue deteriorate several year treatment . Conventional therapy dysphagia yield minor benefit . Persistence dysphagia major impact quality life cancer survivor . Recently , new therapy approach introduce dysphagia , call e-stim Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) . Through low voltage current deliver skin , motor nerve excite , cause muscle contraction . An aggressive marketing campaign turn e-stim popular sought-after therapy dysphagia . However , efficacy study demonstrate true benefit . We collect preliminary data Head &amp; Neck cancer patient use modality see improve swallow function 9/15 patient . This extremely promising support need randomize clinical trial . The randomized control trial ( RCT ) propose compare NMES therapy combine exercise therapy sham NMES protocol combine exercise therapy . These therapy give post-radiated H &amp; N cancer patient moderate severe dysphagia least 3 month post-XRT ( post-XRT + post-CRT ) , determine whether NMES efficacious . Therapy continue 12 week intense , daily home program . Objective indicator change swallow function take modified barium swallow ( MBS ) study . Subjective measure change patient ' self-reported diet , eat ability , quality life , indicate whether perceived benefit therapy . This new treatment may represent first real hope improve swallow grow population cancer survivor . We need determine whether represent truly beneficial treatment whether resource redirect . If successful , study stimulate multitude additional research elucidate mechanism underlie new treatment .</detailed_description>
