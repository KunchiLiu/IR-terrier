	<brief_summary>Because management child solid tumor hinge extent disease , crucial identify metastatic site . Helical chest compute tomography ( CT ) standard method exclude pulmonary metastasis . However , CT lack molecular information regard nodule histology often biopsy require exclude malignancy . Biopsy procedures carry know risk include associated anesthesia sedation , infection , pneumothorax , hemorrhage , pain post-procedure post-operative complication may also add unnecessary cost management patient . We find ability three experience pediatric radiologist correctly predict nodule histology base CT image feature limit ( 57 % 67 % rate correct classification ) . Also , slight moderate agreement nodule classification reviewer . Furthermore , 50 child undergone pulmonary nodule biopsy St. Jude last five year , 44 % ( 22/50 ) benign nodule . Adult study show nuclear medicine scan call fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) fusion modality PET-CT superior diagnostic CT distinguish benign malignant pulmonary nodule FDG PET give information metabolic activity nodule . Nodules malignant metabolic activity , hence FDG uptake/intensity , benign . There little work do child determine value PET PET-CT evaluation pulmonary nodule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study PET-CT Assessment Pulmonary Nodules Children With Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , seek ass feasibility perform PET-CT evaluation pulmonary nodule child obtain preliminary data sample size determination large multi-institutional trial . The primary objective multi-institutional trial compare accuracy diagnostic CT alone PET-CT distinguish benign malignant nodule child solid malignancy . We hopeful PET-CT allow u good direct clinical management patient reduce number invasive procedure perform confirm presence benign disease .</detailed_description>
