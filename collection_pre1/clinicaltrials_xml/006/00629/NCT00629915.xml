	<detailed_description>Moyamoya disease rare medical disorder affect blood vessel ( pipe transport blood ) brain . In Moyamoya disease , large blood vessel middle brain close time . The cause disorder unknown . In order compensate narrowing , body grow new small blood vessel around blockage . These small branch grow large ( may numerous ) give disorder name . `` Moyamoya '' Japanese term `` puff smoke '' use describe hazy appearance small blood vessel angiogram . Treatment moyamoya difficult little known disease . Some people never stroke others may several . It likely stroke due insufficient blood flow brain . There surgical procedure may improve blood flow brain , however , procedure may cause complication may always improve blood flow . The main purpose study determine people moyamoya disease insufficient blood flow high risk stroke . In study researcher learn risk potential benefit surgical treatment . This information help decide people high risk stroke might benefit surgery low risk might benefit . In study , participant undergo baseline clinical laboratory evaluation . Measurements blood flow brain oxygen use obtain use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Participants follow 5 year . PET study conduct one three year enrollment determine blood flow improve time . Participants treat surgery ( discretion treat physician ) also follow perioperative complication , improvement blood flow , long term risk stroke .</detailed_description>
