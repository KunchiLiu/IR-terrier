	<brief_summary>Palmoplantar psoriasis variant psoriasis affect palm sol . It one debilitate variant psoriasis often interfere daily activity ability work . This type psoriasis difficult treat topicals difficulty penetrate thick epidermis palm sole therefore effective . The response standard agent ( methotrexate , cyclosporine acitretin ) also usually limit . A number patient severe hand foot disease mild involvement elsewhere body . Given efficacy infliximab psoriasis , purpose study evaluate infliximab safe improve severity quality life patient palmoplantar psoriasis , debilitate variant psoriasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Infliximab Palmoplantar Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 24 patient non-pustular palmoplantar psoriasis affect least 10 % combined palm sol area modify palmoplantar pustulosis area severity index ( m-PPPASI ) least 8 recruit . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either infliximab 5 mg/kg placebo ( normal saline ) week 0 , 2 6 . Patients assign placebo first 3 infusion receive infliximab 5 mg/kg week 14 , 16 20 placebo week 22 patient assigned receive infliximab first 3 infusion receive infliximab week 14 placebo week 16 week 20 well infliximab last infusion week 22 . The primary endpoint week 14 . Patients come back clinic week 26 final efficacy safety assessment . Efficacy evaluate assess psoriasis plaque severity palm sol ( physician 's global assessment PGA ) , percentage palm sol area affect psoriasis ( palmoplantar surface area - PPSA ) well m-PPPASI ( modify palmoplantar pustulosis area severity index ) . Quality life evaluate every visit perform dermatology life quality index DLQI . Safety evaluate repeat chemistry haematology laboratory regular visit well physical examination assessment adverse event .</detailed_description>
