	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This research trial study gene expression profile cervical cancer progression biopsy tissue sample patient cervical lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Profiling Cervical Cancer Progression Biopsies Tissue Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Classify cervical cancer progression molecular level use gene expression profile generate expression microarrays . - Profile gene expression change dysplasia early carcinoma uterine cervical tissue molecular level use expression microarrays . - Define set gene classify various grade cervical cancer/dysplasia molecular level . - Compare expression profile clinical data determine accurately cell line model vivo environment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo colposcopy cervical smear take flow cytometry analysis . Patients also undergo 2 biopsy one clinically abnormal normal site . Tissue sample analyze gene expression profile use human expression microarrays contain approximately 40,000 unique sequence . Data analysis consist define set gene , contain new target biomarkers , classify biopsy 3 grade .</detailed_description>
