	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety toxicity combination Temozolomide Azacitidine treatment Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma Malignant Mesothelioma . This single-center , open-label , single-arm Phase I dose-escalation trial . Patients evaluate complete history physical well laboratory study ( complete blood count , metabolic panel , liver function test ) , biopsy , image site measurable disease . This study conduct course 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Dose-Escalation Study Of Azacitidine In Combination With Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine clinical laboratory toxicity well acceptability/tolerance dose schedule combine drug treatment temozolomide azacitidine . Secondary objective include determination biochemical response azacitidine define change methylation status . We specifically look change genome wide methylation pattern determine two high-throughput platform : 1 . A single nucleotide polymorphism chip-based method ( MSNP ) genome wide epigenetic profiling 2 . CpG island promoter array perform focus promoter methylation status . We also monitor clinical response , time progression overall survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm soft tissue sarcoma mesothelioma . Ineligible high priority national institutional study . Nonpregnant , nonlactating . Recurrent progressive disease define increase size exist tumor mass , development new tumor mass mass , amenable definitive surgical therapy . Measurable disease define lesion measure least one dimension physical examination mean medical image technique . Ascites pleural effusion consider measurable disease . Prior chemotherapy allow exception prior treatment Temozolomide Azacitidine . Patients must receive prior 1st line therapy . There upper limit number prior therapy receive . Prior treatment alkylating agent acceptable . Prior radiation therapy allow . At least 4 week since prior chemotherapy least 6 week since prior radiation therapy . Patients may another cancer must convince clinical evidence sarcoma disease require therapeutic intervention . ( i.e . Several sarcoma patient prior cancer [ Hodgkin 's disease breast cancer ] treat year previously develop clinically active sarcoma . ) Clinical parameter : Life expectancy &gt; 3 month , Age &gt; 18 year , Performance Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % .
