	<detailed_description>The increase use epidural anesthesia labor lead increase incidence prolonged second stage indication cesarean section instrumental delivery . The use oxytocin proven effective method augmentation labor prolong labor case . However , despite oxytocin augmentation , increase number case require cesarean section instrumental delivery effect delivery . McRobert 's maneuver , often use relieve shoulder dystocia , recently show increase intrauterine pressure approximately two-fold . However ; arduous position pregnant woman maintain long period time . Developing alternative method maximize expulsive force , uterine contraction maternal expulsive effort , may great value reduce number cesarean section instrumental delivery . Various researcher investigate effect occlusal support device ( OSD ) isometric strength different muscle group , e.g. , neck , back , extremity . The natural condition dental occlusion , also know index physical performance , affect muscle strength body balance . When occlusal support give edentulous individual show improved physical exercise ability re-establishment mandibular support . Patients whose dentition proper occlusion demonstrate great endurance isometric muscle strength malocclusion . We hypothesize optimization dental occlusion OSD may improve muscle strength , lead increase intrauterine pressure second stage labor . The aim study investigate whether use OSD result shorten duration second stage labor .</detailed_description>
