	<brief_summary>To assess emetic response multi-day dos Palonosetron Aprepitant low dose dexamethasone +/- Prochlorperazine among patient multiple myeloma lymphoma undergo autologous HSCT utilize Multinational Association Supportive Care Cancer ( MASCC ) Antiemesis Tool ( MAT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-day Doses Prevention Nausea Emesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use high dos chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant show prolong disease control among patient multiple myeloma patient lymphomas relapse recurred . Patients receive autologous stem cell transplant stem cell collect store prior receive high-dose chemotherapy , stem cell give back patient transplant . However , use high dos chemotherapy associate significant side effect nausea vomit . Before use newer medication , incidence nausea vomit could high 70-90 % . Nausea unpleasant feeling awareness urge vomit . Vomiting process throw forcefully content stomach . Retching act similar vomit produce throw content stomach . It also call `` dry heave '' . There three kind nausea vomit associate chemotherapy . Acute nausea and/or vomit occur within first 24 hour administration chemotherapy . Delayed nausea and/or vomit begin first 24 hour chemotherapy could last several day afterwards . Anticipatory nausea/vomiting experience prior administration subsequent chemotherapy . Chemotherapy produce nausea vomit damage cell line stomach intestine result release substance call serotonin . The serotonin bind protein `` receptor '' ( 5-HT3 receptor ) lining intestine . The receptor send message vomit center brain . The brain send signal body produce nausea vomiting . Another substance , call substance P , also release line stomach intestine damage chemotherapy , release together serotonin . The substance P bind another protein call `` neurokinin-1 receptor '' NK-1 receptor . These protein find intestine another portion brain call `` tractus solitarius '' . The brain signal body produce nausea vomiting . The stimulation serotonin proteins result acute nausea vomiting . The stimulation NK-1 protein result delay nausea vomiting . There medication could block serotonin NK-1 protein . Serotonin blocker ondansetron Zofran® consider medication choice prevent treat nausea vomit transplant setting . However , use could still result nausea vomit 40-50 % patient . Nausea vomit negatively impact quality life patient undergoing stem cell transplant multiple myeloma lymphoma . It affect appetite sleep ; interfere activity , social life enjoyment life . Therefore , important find good way prevent control nausea vomit associate chemotherapy . There two new medication available patient receive regular dos chemotherapy . One long act preparation serotonin blocker call palonosetron Aloxi® . It use control acute delay nausea vomit . Another medication could block NK-1 receptor , call aprepitant Emend® . This prevent delayed nausea vomit . Although two medication test proven effective among patient receive regular dos chemotherapy , test combination among patient undergo high dos chemotherapy set autologous stem cell transplant . The purpose study evaluate combination two medication , together small dos steroid ( dexamethasone ) , would effective prevent acute delay vomiting associate high dos chemotherapy stem cell transplant patient multiple myeloma lymphoma . The usual way administer palonosetron single injection vein chemotherapy . This show effective chemotherapy give 1 day . Since chemotherapy regimen transplant require multiple day treatment , palonosetron also administer multiple day thereby deliver high dos drug . Aprepitant would administer standard dos . This study would assess combine palonosetron aprepitant well give multiple high dos palonosetron would safe effective control nausea vomit set transplant . The study would evaluate effect combine palonosetron aprepitant quality life regard nausea vomiting , patient undergo transplant .</detailed_description>
