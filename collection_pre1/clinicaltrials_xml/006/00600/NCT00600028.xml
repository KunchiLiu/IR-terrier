	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) rapidly progressive lung disorder often associate chronic , intractable cough . The etiology cough associate IPF unclear often severe adversely effect patient 's quality life . We propose thalidomide specifically suppress cough associate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via anti-inflammatory property , suppress excessive functional up-regulation sensory fiber respiratory tract patient IPF . This study Phase III , double blind , randomize , placebo control , crossover trial test efficacy thalidomide suppress chronic cough IPF . The primary objective study determine efficacy thalidomide administer daily 12 week suppress chronic cough patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis measure cough specific questionnaire , scale improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study Phase III , double blind , randomize , placebo control , crossover trial test efficacy thalidomide suppress chronic cough IPF . All subject randomize either begin study receive active study drug - ( thalidomide ) inactive drug ( placebo ) . Study drug administer escalate dose start 50 mg day increase 100 mg day cough still present 2 week . Study drug take mouth bedtime . Patients remain initial treatment 12 week . After 12 week treatment , subject administer Cough Specific Quality Life Questionnaire ( CQLQ ) , visual cough analogue scale , St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . In addition , investigator collect subject cough diary . After 12 week treatment subject enter 2 week wash-out phase drug discontinue . After 2 week wash-out phase , subject administer Cough Specific Quality Life Questionnaire ( CQLQ ) , visual cough analogue scale , St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . In addition , investigator collect subject cough diary . All subject cross treatment arm additional 12 week treatment . After second 12 week treatment , subject administer Cough Specific Quality Life Questionnaire ( CQLQ ) , visual cough analogue scale , St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) .
