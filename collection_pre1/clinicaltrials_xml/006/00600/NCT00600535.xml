	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetics Study Assess Abiraterone Acetate Capsule Tablet Formulations Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study ( identity assign study drug know ) evaluate pharmacokinetics abiraterone acetate patient prostate cancer . The study conduct 4 stage : Stage 1 measure blood level patient take 1 daily dose abiraterone tablet capsule formulation without food ; Stage 2 measure blood level single daily dose abiraterone tablet formulation take without food parallel design disease progression ( 12 cycle [ 28 day per cycle ] ) ; Stages 3 4 evaluate safety antitumor effect abiraterone tablet formulation administer low dose glucocorticoid fast state 12 month stage . As Protocol Amendment 4 , patient complete 12 cycle abiraterone acetate treatment continue receive clinical benefit treatment enter Stage 4 receive abiraterone acetate fast condition low-dose glucocorticoid . Patients continue Stage 4 additional 24 cycle . After patient complete last study visit , follow every 3 month disease progression survival 3 year . Serial pharmacokinetic sample collect Stages 1 2 . Efficacy safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
