	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether gentamicin-collagen sponge safe effective prevent sternal wound infection patient undergo cardiac surgery great risk develop sternal wound infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Antibiotic Implant Cardiac Surgical Subjects Higher Risk Sternal Wound Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sternal wound infection ( SWI ) significant problem cardiac surgical subject , particular risk factor diabetes obesity . There long unmet need intervention reduce incidence severity SWIs high-risk subject . Gentamicin antibiotic effective treat certain kind infection . Collagen protein find mammal . The gentamicin-collagen sponge thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain gentamicin . When inserted surgical site , collagen break gentamicin release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level antibiotic surgical site may prevent infection surgical site . Outside United States 3,500 subject receive treatment clinical study gentamicin-collagen sponge , primarily orthopedic , intraabdominal , cardiothoracic surgery wound infection follow surgical procedure traumatic event . In study , subject give treatment normally give prevent surgical infection . For subject randomly assign gentamicin-collagen sponge treatment group , 2 sponge place sternal half surgery . IMMEDIATELY insertion sponge surgeon wet sponge saline show training/certification document . This wet sponge SHOULD BE INSERTED INTO THE STERNUM WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 15 SECONDS ( AFTER THIS TIME IT MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE ) . All subject follow 90 day surgery determine whether develop sternal wound infection .</detailed_description>
