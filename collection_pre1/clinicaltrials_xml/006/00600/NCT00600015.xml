	<brief_summary>This trial investigate use newer target agent erlotinib sorafenib patient stage IIIB stage IV NSCLC receive 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimen . Patients randomize receive erlotinib ( 150 mg/day ) sorafenib ( 400 mg twice daily ) , erlotinib ( 150 mg/day ) placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib/Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale study combine two distinct kinase inhibitor evaluate synergistic inhibition angiogenesis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal . Erlotinib oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor target EGFR . Sorafenib oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor beta , Raf-1 , Flt-3 , C-kit . These agent also exhibit overlap adverse event profile provide additional support study combination therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm locally advanced metastatic NSCLC ( unresectable stage IIIB stage IV ) . Eligible histology include adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma . Patients recurrent disease treatment localize NSCLC also eligible . Cytologic specimen obtain brushing , washing , needle aspiration acceptable . At least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique , &gt; = 10 mm spiral computerize tomography ( CT ) scan accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Failure least one , two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens advanced disease ( either due progressive disease toxicity ) . Recovery toxic effect prior therapy &lt; = grade 1 . Completion radiation therapy least 28 day prior start study treatment ( include palliative local radiation ) . Previously irradiated lesion advance set include target lesion unless clear tumor progression observe since end radiation . An ECOG performance status 02 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1,500 , platelet &gt; = 75,000 . Hemoglobin &gt; = 9 g/dL ( within 7 day prior study treatment ) . International normalized ratio ( INR ) &lt; = 1.5 prothrombin time ( PT ) /partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal limit ( WNL ) institution Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) within 7 day prior study treatment . Transaminases &lt; = 3 x institutional ULN Agreement female patient childbearing potential male patient partner childbearing potential use effective form contraception prevent pregnancy treatment , minimum 90 day thereafter . Patients treat brain metastasis &gt; = 4 week ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) evidence CNS progression . Past current history neoplasm ( entry diagnosis ) , exception treat nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix , cancer cure local therapy alone , diseasefree survival ( DFS ) &gt; = 3 year . Patients mixed tumor smallcell element ineligible . Pregnancy lactation . Prior treatment EGFR TKIs VEGFR TKIs NSCLC . [ NOTE : prior cetuximab and/or bevacizumab use permit ] . Significant cardiac disease within 90 day start study treatment Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior initiation study treatment . Cardiomegaly chest image ventricular hypertrophy electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Poorly control hypertension Unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) . Cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy . Presence cardiac disease , opinion investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia . A serious underlying medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . A major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day begin treatment , anticipation need major surgery course study . Stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within past 6 month . Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy . Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; = grade 2 within 28 day study treatment . Any nonpulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; = grade 3 within 28 day study treatment . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture .</criteria>
