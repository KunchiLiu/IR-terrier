	<brief_title>Data Analyses Ancillary WISE Femhrt Hormone Replacement Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous unexpected event occur course study lead incomplete underpowered result . Recruitment close prematurely due failure recruit follow publication Women 's Health Initiative hormone trial . No conclusion could draw due power limitation . We lose P31 MR Spectroscopy core lab WISE MR expert investigator move new institution WISE MR CORE site ( UAB 1996 2001 ) . The planned P31tests could complete protocol use initial phase WISE . Initial WISE cohort brachial artery FMD data show large variability FMD weakly associate presence CAD ( Am Heart J 2002 ; 802-807 ) . Also WISE woman FMD fail correlate directly measure coronary artery endothelial dysfunction response intracoronary acetylcholine . So enthusiasm FMD testing wan among WISE investigator . No conclusion could draw due power limitation . We observe 50 % WISE woman initial cohort could perform modify ACIP protocol ( use substudy ETT ) even exclude nondiagnostic study respective sensitivity specificities 43 66 % ( Am Heart J 2005 ; 149 ; 527-533 ) . So 16 17 woman placebo FemHRT group , respectively , complete ETTs 16 week among 37 randomized majority `` indeterminate '' . Exercise duration , specify secondary outcome measure . No conclusion could draw due power limitation .</detailed_description>
