	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether gentamicin-collagen sponge safe effective prevent surgical wound infection patient undergo colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Antibiotic Implant General Surgical Subjects Higher Risk Surgical Wound Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical wound infection ( SWI ) significant problem colorectal surgery . Despite use routine bowel preparation prophylactic antibiotic incidence SWI least 15 % patient undergoing colorectal surgical procedures.Therefore , long unmet need intervention reduce incidence severity SWIs patient undergo colorectal surgery . Gentamicin antibiotic effective treat certain kind infection . Collagen protein find mammal . The gentamicin-collagen sponge thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain gentamicin . When inserted surgical site , collagen break gentamicin release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level antibiotic surgical site may prevent infection surgical site . Outside United States 3,500 subject receive treatment clinical study gentamicin-collagen sponge , primarily orthopedic , intraabdominal , cardiothoracic surgery wound infection follow surgical procedure traumatic event . In study , subject give treatment normally give prevent surgical infection . For subject randomly assign gentamicin-collagen sponge treatment group , 2 sponge insert surgical wound immediately surgeon close . The control group receive collagen sponge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Scheduled undergo nonemergent colon and/or rectal surgical procedure involve laparotomy incision least 7 cm length great . List eligible procedure : Left Hemicolectomy , Transverse Colectomy , Segmental/Sleeve Left Colon Resection , Total Abdominal Colectomy With Ileorectal Anastomosis , Total Abdominal Colectomy With Ileostomy , Total Abdominal Proctocolectomy ( Portion Of Specimen To Be Extracted Via Laparotomy ) , Low Anterior Resection , Sigmoid Resection , NonEmergent Hartmann 's Procedure , Colotomy With Polypectomy Distal To Hepatic Flexure , Colostomy Takedown Through Laparotomy ( Not Peristomal ) Incision , IleoPouch Anal Anastomosis , Abdominal Perineal Resection Rectum Have capacity understand sign inform consent form . Are male female &gt; 18 year age . If female , postmenopausal ( menstrual period minimum 1 year ) , surgically sterilize ( uterus bilateral tubal ligation ) . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test entry study , agree use adequate birth control study 60 day administration study agent . Agree available evaluation baseline final evaluation 60 day postsurgery . Known history hypersensitivity gentamicin bovine collagen . Undergoing emergency surgery ( urgent surgery allow informed consent obtain study procedure perform ) . Emergency surgery include case standard bowel preparation preoperative assessment do . Undergoing significant concomitant surgical procedure ( e.g. , hysterectomy ) . The following concomitant procedure allow : appendectomy , cholecystectomy , oophorectomy , liver biopsy/wedge resection ( liver resection ) . Undergoing laparoscopic , laparoscopicassisted , minimally invasive surgical approach involve laparotomy incision le 7 cm . History prior laparotomy within last 60 day plan procedure . Planned undergo second laparotomy colorectal surgical procedure ( e.g . colostomy ileostomy takedown ) within 60 day plan first procedure . Evidence preoperatively follow : sepsis , severe sepsis , septic shock ( note SIRS alone exclusion criterion ) Current abdominal wall infection/surgical site infection previous laparotomy/laparoscopy reason . Receiving antibiotic therapy within 1 week prior date surgery . Preoperative evaluation suggest intraabdominal process might preclude full closure skin . History ongoing treatment ( e.g . chemotherapy , radiation ) noncolorectal cancer . Recent history significant drug alcohol abuse . Preoperative prothrombin time ( PT ) &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal Pregnant , lactating , childbearing potential practice birth control method high degree reliability Postsurgical life expectancy â‰¤ 60 day , investigator 's sponsor 's opinion . Refusal accept medically indicate blood product . Previous participation active Innocoll GentamicinCollagen Sponge study . Participation within 30 day start study experimental drug device study , currently participate study administration investigational drug device within 60 day anticipate . Surgeon believe possible insert 2 sponge fascia patient ( e.g . thin patient plan small incision ) Patients anterior abdominal wall mesh plan completely remove planned procedure . Presence prosthetic cardiac valve .</criteria>
