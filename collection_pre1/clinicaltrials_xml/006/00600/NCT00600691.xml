	<brief_title>The Use Finasteride Reduce Hematuria Hematospermia Following TRUS Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Purpose : The purpose study primarily evaluate effect 5mg finasteride hematuria hematospermia commonly associate prostate biopsy . We also examine effective dosing finasteride administer two week prior biopsy one week follow . We also use subject questionnaire ass subject 's attitude concern hematuria hematospermia . We examine overall subjective tolerability biopsy procedure , concern sexual function , anxiety surround prostate cancer , urination follow procedure . Questionnaires use 10 point visual analog scale gauge subject 's attitude concern . We examine statistically significant correlation parameter complication monitor . We also monitor side effect subject , effort gauge potential risk associate short term usage finasteride compare benefit afford finasteride reduce hematuria hematospermia . Hypotheses : Based previous research molecular mechanism finasteride , hypothesize 5mg finasteride daily two week precede TRUS prostate biopsy one week follow reduce hematuria hematospermia commonly see complication follow prostate biopsy . We also hypothesize reduce complication decrease concern among subject make tolerable overall procedure compare subject treat placebo . Objectives : To determine effectiveness 5mg finasteride administer two week prior prostate biopsy one week follow reduce hematuria hematospermia follow biopsy . To gauge subject 's concern relate hematuria , hematospermia , transmit prostate cancer partner follow TRUS prostate biopsy . To examine subject 's subjective sexual function urination relation treatment group . To demonstrate benefit finasteride relation safety tolerability treatment . Endpoints : Differences rate severity hematuria hematospermia among subject treatment placebo group . Differences complication follow biopsy , hospitalization requirement blood transfusion , treatment placebo group . Differences placebo group finasteride treatment group : overall subjective experience biopsy procedure , concern relate hematuria hematospermia , sexual function , urination follow prostate biopsy . Monitor side effect placebo finasteride administer three week total duration . Research design : The study plan conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo control study determine effect 5mg finasteride rate/severity hematuria hematospermia follow TRUS prostate biopsy . A total 50 subject randomize one two group . One group receive 5mg finasteride orally two week prior TRUS biopsy , one week biopsy . Another group receive placebo orally two week prior procedure one week follow biopsy . Patients identified participation exist indication TRUS prostate biopsy , subsequently enrol . Subjects receive current standard care addition participate study . The study design investigate effect finasteride compare placebo hematuria hematospermia follow prostate biopsy . Subjects assign treatment group use randomization process eliminate selection bias , ensure difference two study group due random chance . The study design placebo control double blinded ensure investigator subject ascertainment bias minimize . As current prophylactic treatment decrease rate/severity hematuria hematospermia follow prostate biopsy , raise ethical concern placebo group . Subject recruitment do ongoing basis . Statistical analysis plan : We perform statistical analysis data collect study . We examine whether statistically significant difference rate hematuria hematospermia placebo finasteride treatment group . We also examine statistically significant relationship study group ( placebo versus finasteride ) concern regard hematuria/hematospermia , satisfaction with/tolerability biopsy , concern prostate cancer transmission , sexual/urinary function , side effect . Research Procedures : Subjects identify potential participant study office Dr. Pommerville . Dr. Pommerville identify subject within urology practice need TRUS biopsy medical necessity reason unrelated enrollment study . The indication prostate biopsy usually base clinical suspicion use combination digital rectal examination prostate specific antigen blood test . Once identify potential candidate participation study , Dr. Pommerville give potential subject detail explanation study explain content inform consent form . Once patient read consent form understand study entail , make decision whether enroll study . Once informed consent obtain , subject assign unique identification number , used purpose . This identification code feature allow code broken emergency situation . At time , subject randomly assign placebo treatment group double blind fashion . Subjects give three week supply 5mg finasteride placebo detailed instruction take medication/placebo . They instruct take medication/placebo , one tablet ( 5mg ) finasteride/placebo orally day two week prior biopsy one week follow . This addition standard care normally give prostate biopsy ( antibiotic , enema ) . They give appointment undergo prostate biopsy two week . Subjects instruct decide withdraw study , may time , return unused medication Dr. Pommerville 's office follow Subjects undergo TRUS prostate biopsy two week later part standard medical care either Royal Jubilee Hospital Victoria General Hospital . Equipment procedure differ site . Patients follow point Dr. Pommerville participation adherence study protocol . If subject compliant protocol , withdrawn study . Subjects receive repeat instruction take medication release would expect part standard care prostate biopsy . They give appointment two week TRUS biopsy see Dr. Pommerville clinic . They remind come clinic approximately 20 minute prior appointment time Nathan Hoag ( Medical student ) may administer questionnaire accordance describe informed consent form . Subjects present schedule two week follow appointment Dr. Pommerville 's office . This practice accordance normal standard care . Nathan Hoag administer subject questionnaire point . Questionnaires administer prior subject see Dr. Pommerville biopsy result effort minimize emotional influence result questionnaire . This last visit standard medical care prostate biopsy . Subjects instruct follow Dr. Pommerville family physicians additional concern . At time , subject remind return Dr. Pommerville 's office additional two week , medical student administer questionnaire second time monitor ongoing change ( 4 week since procedure ) . In addition patient questionnaire , previously describe grade system use quantify incidence severity hematuria hematospermia among subject two four weeks.18,19 Hematospermia grade system quantify hematospermia mild ( le 7 day ) , moderate ( 7 14 day ) , severe ( 14 day ) . Hematuria define grossly pass blood blood clot urine . Hematuria stratify use minor episode ( last 24 hour less ) , moderate episode ( last 24 hour , require hospital admission ) , severe episode ( clot retention hospital admission ) . Hematuria grade accord follow system : grade 0 ( gross hematuria ) , grade 1 ( 2 minor episode 1 moderate episode ) , grade 2 ( 2 minor episode 1 moderate episode ) , grade 3 ( 1 severe episode ) . This conclusion study subject . They remind free contact Nathan Hoag concern question . They also remind may follow Dr. Pommerville family physician need .</detailed_description>
