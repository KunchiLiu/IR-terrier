	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine Mirtazapine produce decrease interest drug , decrease mood elevation , and/or decrease reward give methamphetamine compare placebo . Participants screen psychiatric interview , medical history physical , laboratory test , drug abuse screen , female , urine pregnancy test . They provide write informed consent . They study within-subjects examination subjective mood response mirtazapine methamphetamine . Interactions methamphetamine mirtazapine assess pharmacokinetic study . Each participant introduce rating scale cognitive task describe . Participants remain research unit 5 hour day receive study medication placebo . They spend five day total research unit , one day separate least one day ; two day block separate least one day another two day block . A venous catheter place blood draw . Blood pressure heart rate record assess . Participants randomize double blind receive either placebo mirtazapine orally two hour prior administration randomize double blind methamphetamine placebo order peak effect drug overlap . VAS-mood , ARCI , GRS , POMS POMS-E , neurocognitive task Trails A B Symbol digits modality test administer prior mirtazapine placebo dose , repeat administration methamphetamine placebo . After administration methamphetamine placebo , vital sign assess every 15 minute measure repeat 120 minute pass initial dose methamphetamine placebo .

	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine dependence major health problem US . Methamphetamine 's reinforcing effect associate abuse liability depend upon activation cortico-mesolimbic dopamine ( CMDA ) system . Medications antagonize CMDA function might therapeutic potential Mirtazapine appear affect pathway . Mirtazapine work serotinergic ( 5-HT ) mechanisms 5HT 2 3 , alpha 2 H1 antagonist note decrease excitatory response methamphetamine challenge animal . Mirtazapine increase dopamine release prefrontal cortex 5HT receptor activation . Additionally , randomize , placebo control trial ; individual take mirtazapine amphetamine detoxification find significant improvement hyper arousal anxiety subset score discontinue stimulant . Methamphetamine give safely healthy human volunteer study . We propose conduct first preliminary human laboratory study determine mirtazapine 15 mg diminishes methamphetamine ( 20 mg ) induce positive subjective interest , mood elevation reinforce value . This dose methamphetamine use investigator healthy volunteer . This preliminary trial first sequence study characterize dose dependent effect mirtazapine treatment agent methamphetamine dependence . If study successful , would afford u scientific platform rationale progress test efficacy mirtazapine among methamphetamine dependent individual human laboratory clinical trial . The primary objective study evaluate systematically neurobehavioral basis dose-response effect mirtazapine acutely methamphetamine-induced interest , mood elevation reward . This study employ well-validated , state-of-the-art , human laboratory technique determine extent mirtazapine block methamphetamine induce euphoria , reinforcement , cue crave healthy volunteer test controlled hospital environment medical supervision .</detailed_description>
