	<detailed_description>I . PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose study characterize neuromagnetic activation 0-3,000 Hz normal child adult use state art MEG system . MEG instrument allow quantitative measurement brain function high temporal spatial resolution ( see Appendix A ) . Conventional MEG data analysis method focus magnetic signal time domain . In order extend usefulness MEG , use three advance signal-processing technique focus magnetic signal frequency domain . Our MEG system combine three advanced signal-processing technique may open new window understand development brain . Specifically , propose study sensorimotor , auditory , visual language evoke magnetic field normal child . Since maturation brain may associate change neuromagnetic signal generate sensorimotor , auditory , visual language system , one group adult include clarify maturational change . The normative data propose study would essential identification abnormality brain various disorder ; data foundation development clinical application child MEG . The follow aim exploratory hypothesis probed : Specific Aim 1 . To characterize evoked sensorimotor , auditory , visual language evoke magnetic response The work hypothesis aim least one magnetic response identify averaged magnetic waveform follow sensorimotor , auditory , visual language stimulation . The latency amplitude evoke magnetic response quantitatively measure normal , age-adjusted range determine . Statistical comparison child adult across pediatric age range perform . Furthermore , characterize neuromagnetic activation subgroup child estimate maturational change brain . The hypothesis aim exploratory , intent gather normative data . The following hypothesis probe data : 1 . The neuromagnetic response evoke sensorimotor , auditory visual stimulation simple pattern . 2 . The neuromagnetic response evoke language stimulation would complex pattern . 3 . Among four modality , latency amplitude , sensorimotor evoke magnetic response small coefficient variation language evoke response large . We hardware , software , technique skill quantitatively measure statistically compare evoke magnetic response . The MEG result normal child provide foundation future study diseased population child . Specific Aim 2 . To volumetrically localize neuromagnetic spectral distribution evoke sensorimotor , auditory , visual language stimulation The work hypothesis aim three-dimensional distribution neuromagnetic spectral power reveal focal change around sensorimotor , auditory , visual language cortex child . The development multichannel MEG system make possible simultaneously record neuromagnetic activation entire cortex . The new magnetic signal processing technique ability reconstruct three-dimensional neuromagnetic activation ( see Appendix A , Figure 6 , example ) . The frequency-spectral profile provide novel information specific neural activation pattern eloquent cortex . This exploratory aim use data record Specific Aim 1 . The hypothesis aim : 1 . Each eloquent brain area ( sensorimotor , auditory , visual language cortex ) may associate one specific frequency band . The spectral power certain frequency band may increase specific brain area . 2 . High frequency oscillation identify four modality ; however , three-dimensional distribution high frequency oscillation different across modality . The high frequency component may identify conventional magnetic response . 3 . Synchronization de-synchronization observe sensorimotor , auditory , visual language system . However , frequency band region different among four modality . The three technique measure reliable , non-biased , quantitative magnetic manner , signal frequency domain . Since conventional MEG data analysis method focus magnetic signal time domain , present study provide novel neuromagnetic profile brain child . The new objective neuromagnetic parameter enable u quantitatively evaluate brain function maturation normal child possibly child brain disorder future . Specific Aim 3 . To quantitatively estimate neuromagnetic maturational change sensorimotor , auditory , visual language system child The work hypothesis aim MEG combine three new signal processing technique reveal maturational change sensorimotor , auditory , visual language system child . The propose research focus child . We recruit one group adult reference , differentiate neuromagnetic maturational change inter-individual variation . Since previous MEG report [ 3,4 ] functional brain mapping focus adult , MEG data adult group also allow u compare result result MEG sit . With three new signal-processing technique well conventional method , study provide quantitative data estimate maturational change brain . This exploratory aim use data record Specific Aims 1 2 . The hypothesis aim : 1 . In normal child , sensorimotor , auditory , visual evoke magnetic response change linearly age . However , language evoke magnetic response may change nonlinearly due development lateralization . 2 . The neuromagnetic difference girl boy may observe auditory , visual language system . However , phenomenon may observable certain age . 3 . The maturational change brain may associate frequency change normal child . The development brain childhood adulthood quantitatively monitor use MEG . Once complete study specific aim 1 aim 2 , address aim . We consider aim directly address data , analysis software hardware available . The maturational neuromagnetic result enable u objectively evaluate brain function various age group . We consider result contribute clinical management child developmental brain disorder . II . SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY IN RELATION TO HUMAN HEALTH Many disorder cerebral function associate abnormal pattern brain activity , assess use neurophysiology . Neurophysiologic measure thus provide insight underlie biology normal diseased brain . MEG evolve , noninvasive technology allow precise spatial temporal measurement neurophysiological function ( see Appendix A ) . MEG measure weak magnetic field originate human brain [ 5 ] . Its time resolution 1 millisecond , significantly short functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , spatial discrimination 2-3 mm source cerebral cortex , much good electroencephalography ( EEG ) [ 6,7 ] . MEG provide unique neurophysiologic data obtainable neuroimaging technique . The three advance signal-processing method reveal aspect neuronal function previously could obtain conventional MEG data analysis method , average dipole modeling . We propose use MEG signal-processing technique characterize normal neuromagnetic profile child . Recent change software employ study pose additional risk study participant . This study focus functional brain mapping use MEG normal child . These map available comparison child epilepsy neurological disorder . For clinical purpose , least two valuable role MEG , functional mapping determination location epileptic focus [ 3,4 ] . Neurosurgeons frequently face dilemma decide whether operate remove epileptogenic region cause great harm pathology . This dilemma great reason believe eloquent cortex involve critical either motor skill speech skill . MEG solve problem localize critical brain region provide `` brain map '' guide surgeon [ 3,4 ] . The `` brain map '' also call magnetic source imaging ( MSI ) . MSI combination functional data derive MEG record co-registered structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . MSI show anatomical location functional brain activity . Functional brain mapping child intractable epilepsy necessary reduce surgical morbidity broad clinical applicability several reason . First , prevalence , morbidity , mortality childhood epilepsy high , seizures 40 % patient control adequately medication alone . In patient , surgical treatment must consider . Second , spectrum prenatally postnatally acquire lesion child intractable seizure often create difficulty localization epileptic region use conventional EEG . Third , epileptogenic tissue commonly distinguishable normal cortex operating room , make surgery guide simple intraoperative visual inspection problematic accurate pre-surgical anatomic localization critical . Fourth , standard additional approach intraoperative localization , electrocorticography ( ECoG ) , invasive risky . To record ECoG , electrodes place directly brain . Disadvantages current approach include need craniotomy , risk surgical complication like infection intracerebral hemorrhage , time delay operative procedure . In contrast , MEG non-invasive outpatient procedure . It reduce risk , time expense patient . In summary , outcome propose research significant . First , normal MEG data obtain study basis identification abnormality various brain disorder child . Second , three new signal-processing method open new window understand brain function . Third , gain great experience data acquisition statistical analysis relatively new clinical tool help u establish standardize routine clinical application . Moreover , result present study directly transfer epilepsy surgery produce improve surgical outcome .</detailed_description>
