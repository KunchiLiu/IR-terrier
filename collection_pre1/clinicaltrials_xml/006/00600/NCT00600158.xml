	<brief_summary>Epidural local anesthetic gold standard shorten duration bowel dysfunction bowel surgery . Previous study suggest effect may part result action local anesthetic outside epidural space . If local anesthetic could administer intravenously instead , might safer , easy less expensive approach . Therefore , trial compare effect bowel function recovery intravenous local anesthetic administer epidurally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ileus seem almost unavoidable side effect type bowel surgery . This unfortunate , since postoperative ileus unpleasant patient , also detrimental effect recovery surgery . The maintenance enteral nutrition show important factor ensure rapid recovery gastrointestinal surgery , catabolic state decrease immune function , delay wound heal , increase morbidity . However , ileus often preclude enteral feeding . As result , duration postoperative ileus frequently major determinant duration hospitalization . At time , effective manner minimize duration postoperative ileus use continuous local anesthetic epidural analgesia 3 confirm systematic review topic . This effect appear specifically relate use local anesthetic , postoperative epidural administration opiates alone without effect ileus . Postoperative ileus largely inflammatory origin , appear reduced surgical technique ( e.g . minimally invasive approach ) use associate less inflammatory response ( determine interleukin-6 C-reactive protein level ) . The observation non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug effective reduce duration ileus support hypothesis ( often avoid concern bleed ) . Taken together , finding suggest epidural analgesia local anesthetic may shorten duration postoperative ileus anti-inflammatory action local anesthetic . Modulating effect local anesthetic inflammatory system well know , describe vitro , animal study , less extent clinical trial . In animal , inflammatory-mediated injury heart ameliorate local anesthetic , endotoxin- acid-mediated lung injury . In human , thrombosis incidence11 hypercoagulation surgery ( inflammatory-mediated process ) decrease systemic local anesthetic ( yet physiologic coagulation affect ) . Important current context , effectiveness local anesthetic set inflammatory bowel disease well establish . The compound show decrease release inflammatory mediator neutrophil , may play role beneficial effect . As another example , cognitive deficit cardiac surgery probably result combination embolus inflammatory response induce brain . Systemic local anesthetic would expect interfere process , indeed improve cognitive outcome setting.16 The mechanism behind action likely modulatory effect local anesthetic neutrophil . Local anesthetic show inhibit neutrophil priming ( critical component neutrophil-mediated tissue injury ) , interfere activation ( require wound heal host defense ) . Importantly , contrast classic inflammatory suppression , inflammatory modulation local anesthetic therefore associate detrimental effect wound heal infection rate . We show selective inhibition local anesthetic cellular Gq proteins explains effect . Other effect , include mediator release , may also play role . Since epidural anesthesia lead significant blood level local anesthetic ( 1 5 ÂµM ) , conceivable inflammatory modulatory action systemically absorb local anesthetic explains beneficial effect epidural analgesia duration postoperative ileus . An additional beneficial effect return bowel function result reduce requirement opiate analgesic . If case , similar beneficial effect might obtain use systemic administration local anesthetic . Both inflammatory modulatory effect analgesic action ( thereby decrease opiate requirement ) present drug give intravenously . This approach would significant advantage epidural administration . The common use perioperative anticoagulation prevention deep venous thrombosis make appropriate timing epidural placement removal considerably difficult . Epidural placement management cost time add expense . Many patient may desire placement epidural catheter . In addition , uncommon real risk epidural placement ( certainly thoracic region ) would avoid systemic administration local anesthetic . The major risk epidural hematoma abscess , devastate . Several clinical trial indicate systemic local anesthetic beneficial action return bowel function surgery . In patient undergo radical prostatectomy , administration lidocaine ( 3 mg/min ) duration surgery 1 h postoperatively result 1 day earlier return bowel function associate earlier discharge hospital compare placebo . Significantly earlier return propulsive motility colon also observe patient undergo cholecystectomy receive intravenous lidocaine ( 3 mg/min intraoperatively continue 24 h post surgery ) . Similarly , intraoperative instillation bupivacaine demonstrate beneficial effect colonic motility . However , study investigate effect postoperative bowel function systemically administer local anesthetic bowel surgery . It set restoration bowel function relevant . We hypothesize intravenous , intraoperative postoperative administration local anesthetic , add patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) post-operative pain relief , result rapid return bowel function compare PCA alone . This hypothesis test randomize , blind , control clinical trial patient undergo open colectomy tumor .</detailed_description>
