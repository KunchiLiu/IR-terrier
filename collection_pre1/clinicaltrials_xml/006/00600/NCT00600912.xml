	<brief_summary>Lipid emulsion essential part parenteral nutrition , part energy supply , source essential fatty acid . It show fatty acid composition cell membrane influence fatty acid profile dietary lipid , may therefore responsible modulation immune response . The aim study assess effect new lipid emulsion base ob soybean oil , medium-chain triglyceride , olive oil fish oil compare lipid emulsion base olive soybean oil inflammatory response hepatic function postoperative intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Lipid Emulsion Inflammatory Response Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatty emulsion indispensable part parenteral nutrition , deliver energy essential fatty acid . Furthermore , lipid involve structure function cell membrane receptor , modify gene expression , modulate inflammatory immune response . In addition , fatty acid precursor prostaglandin eicosanoids therefore important metabolic functions.A promise substrate development lipid emulsion see fish oil contain solution . With regard current literature , fish oil potential benefical influence pathophysiological response endotoxins exert important modulation eicosanoid cytokine biology . However , study avaibale compare fish oil contain fatty emulsion lipid emulsion base olive soybean oil regard inflammatory response hepatic function . Therefore , aim study evaluate effect new lipid emulsion base ob soybean oil , medium-chain triglyceride , olive oil fish oil compare lipid emulsion base olive soybean oil inflammatory response hepatic function postoperative intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient .</detailed_description>
