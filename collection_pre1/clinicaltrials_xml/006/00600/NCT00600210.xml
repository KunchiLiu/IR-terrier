Rationale bevacizumab : Bevacizumab recombinant humanize monoclonal IgG1 antibody bind inhibits biologic activity vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) stimulate tumor tumor blood vessel growth .

	<detailed_description>Five landmark trial cervical cancer prompt National Cancer Institute February 1999 issue clinical announcement state `` strong consideration give add concurrent chemotherapy treatment invasive cervical cancer '' . The chemotherapeutic agent common denominator 5 trial cisplatin , ever since become part standard care treatment stage IIB , III , IVA cervical cancer . In addition , chemoradiotherapy cisplatin also consider one standard treatment option IB2 IIA tumor great 4 cm diameter . The recent GOG protocols cervical cancer use cisplatin 40 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 radiation therapy parametrial brachytherapy boost total 6 cycle . This cisplatin schedule use 2 5 landmark trial Rose [ 3 ] Keys [ 4 ] , respectively . However , benefit survival give cisplatin , without toxicity . Note trial report Rose radiotherapy alone arm comparison . In summary , trial Keys 35 % patient experience grade 3 ( moderate ) grade 4 ( severe ) toxicity , compare 13 % radiotherapy alone arm . Specifically , 21 % experience grade 3 4 leukopenia . Similarly , one Rose , 23 % experience grade 3 4 leukopenia , 49.4 % complete intend 6 cycle chemotherapy . Based toxicity profile cisplatin , Higgins et al . [ 5 ] perform phase II study concurrent carboplatin pelvic radiation therapy primary treatment cervix cancer . They demonstrate ability administer carboplatin dose base AUC 2.0 schedule concurrent radiation therapy treatment cervix cancer . Grade 3 leukopenia observe 10 % patient , grade 4 leukopenia observe . This approximately half incidence leukopenia see cisplatin . More importantly , carboplatin administer AUC 2 175 186 ( 94 % ) plan treatment . Treatment carboplatin study similar excellent response rate , reduce hematologic side effect . A comprehensive analysis literature 1998 compare efficacy carboplatin versus cisplatin solid tumor conclude ovarian cancer lung cancer effectiveness carboplatin comparable cisplatin , germ cell tumor , bladder cancer , head neck cancer cisplatin appear superior [ 6 ] . There mention cervical cancer review , since present phase III trial compare carboplatin versus cisplatin cervix cancer . Targeted therapy Angiogenesis describe majority cancer type affect female genital tract [ 7-14 ] . Multiple growth factor cytokines involve angiogenic process accompanies cervical carcinogenesis . VEGF predominant role act endothelial cell specific mitogen [ 15-17 ] , stimulate cell proliferation increase vascular permeability . Various cancer type include breast , endometrial , ovarian , bladder , lung cancer exhibit elevate VEGF expression advance stage [ 18-25 ] , also associate high-grade intraepithelial lesion cervical cancer [ 26-32 ] . VEGF protein level show correlate local tumor progression , metastasis poor prognosis uterine cervix , base immunohistochemical enzyme immunoassay study [ 26-31 ] . In patient undergo primary radiotherapy cervical cancer , serum VEGF influence progression free survival [ 33 ] . However , report suggest VEGF prognostic value [ 32 ] . In addition , Soufla et al . find highly significant increase VEGF mRNA expression upon cervical neoplastic transformation , high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion exhibit high VEGF mRNA level low-grade lesion [ 34 ] . Treatment endothelial cell carboplatin significantly increase expression VEGF [ 35 ] . Neutralization secrete VEGF specific polyclonal anti-VEGF antibody sensitize endothelial cell carboplatin treatment increase apoptosis several-fold [ 35 ] . Treatment polyclonal anti-VEGF antibody carboplatin show vivo model significantly enhance solid tumor growth inhibition individual monotherapies [ 35 ] . Therefore , target VEGF could potentially benefit cervical cancer patient . Bevacizumab recombinant humanize monoclonal IgG1 antibody bind inhibits biologic activity VEGF . Since bevacizumab may cause proteinuria hypertension , carboplatin , less potential renal toxicity cisplatin , seem good choice combine bevacizumab . The combination radiotherapy , carboplatin , bevacizumab could result good result decreased toxicity .</detailed_description>
