	<brief_summary>The AMES device investigational device cyclically rotate ankle muscle vibrator stimulate sensory receptor muscle opposite joint rotate . In effect , device provide assisted movement joint enhance sensation movement . The purpose study determine whether stroke survivor remain unable move normally one year stroke able walk move affect leg significantly well treatment new robotic therapy , AMES device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year , 600,000 U.S. citizen survive major stroke . Following acute treatment , 30-40 % survivor sustain permanent motor disability . Within week stroke , survive patient begin physical therapy restore motion affect limb . Some recover completely , many . There 5 million stroke survivor U.S. recover completely many severely incapacitated remainder life . The hypothesis underlie stroke rehabilitation AMES , many stroke victim , damage brain disrupt one feedback loop connect proprioceptive receive area primary somatosensory cortex primary pre-motor cortex . Without proprioceptive information feed motor output center , brain `` locate '' muscle need movement occur . The hypothesis behind AMES rehabilitation synchronous repetitive activity input output area cortex stimulate reorganization brain pathway , thereby close feedback loop disrupt stroke . Our research objective develop procedure rehabilitate stroke patient , conventional therapy , bring level maximal recovery . The aim study obtain set data total 16 chronic stroke subject , low extremity disability , age 18-75 , use AMES robotic device rehabilitation clinic . Each subject participate 10 week therapy , 3 day per week , 30 minute per day . The data collect analysed quantify extent combination robot-assisted exercise muscle vibration induce secondary recovery stroke low extremity .</detailed_description>
