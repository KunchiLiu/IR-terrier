	<brief_summary>The application immunotherapeutic strategy target potent antigen present cell , dendritic cell ( DC ) , likely substantially increase magnitude anti-tumor immune response . Although issue activation state antigen load , mechanisms increase number DCs available immune system among first step development affective DC base immunotherapeutic strategy . The Central Hypothesis study : Administration Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma result enhance recruitment DCs sentinel lymph node , peripheral blood , and/or tumor site . We propose perform phase I , dose escalation , clinical trial systemic intra-tumoral GM-CSF administration treatment pancreatic adenocarcinoma . This trial design assess toxicity immunologic effect , principally dendritic cell recruitment . Patients resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma clinical staging criterion eligible enrollment . The trial propose phase I clinical trial addition GM-CSF biological adjuvant standard care patient potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
