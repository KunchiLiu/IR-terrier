	<brief_summary>Sometimes , cancer come back successfully treatedâ€”a situation call recurrent cancer . When recurrent cancer suspect , standard approach diagnosis perform combination image test , x-ray , ultrasound , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , nuclear medicine scan . Sometimes , however , perform test still may clear whether cancer come back . Some study show diagnostic imaging test call Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) may helpful diagnosis recurrent lung , breast , head neck , ovarian esophageal cancer lymphoma . However , clear PET/CT offer well result standard approach diagnosis . This feasibility study need determine common diagnosis recurrent cancer unclear even standard diagnostic imaging test complete . If enrollment goal reach ( ~60 patient enrol 18 month ) , large clinical trial plan determine PET/CT helpful make diagnosis recurrent cancer situation standard image test helpful . It also expect result feasibility study help define exactly patient enrol large clinical trial PET/CT .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients previous history nonsmall cell lung cancer , breast cancer , head neck cancer ( thyroid cancer ) , ovarian cancer , esophageal cancer , lymphoma ( Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's ) suspect recurrence history and/or physical exam . Conventional imaging ( e.g. , Xray , ultrasound , CT , MRI , bone scan ) nondiagnostic . Age le 18 year . Patient establish recurrence require stag recurrent disease . Patients , time initial evaluation , already undergone PET/CT within 6 month prior registration . Unable lie supine image PET/CT . Pregnant lactate female . Significant concurrent medical problem ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , active cardiac disease , significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) make patient unfit cancer therapy . Unable give inform consent .</criteria>
