Compassionate use permit direct supervision qualify expert pediatric infectious disease write approval Schering Plough medical director ( local country operation headquarters project director ) . Subject his/her legally authorize representative give sign , write informed consent , Ability take study medication orally swallow via enteral feed tube . Subject consider eligible clinical research program posaconazole . Safety Related Inclusion Criteria Male female patient meet one follow criterion : postmenopausal , surgically sterilize , document primary ovarian failure due prior cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy ; abstinent sexual intercourse practice effective birth control . Effective birth control method must continue least 30 day discontinuation treatment posaconazole . Known non pregnant history ( preferably ) negative serum urine pregnancy test prior first dose posaconazole female childbearing potential . Not breast feed lactating , willing discontinue breast feeding treatment . Invasive Fungal Infection Inclusion Criteria Each patient must : A documented invasive fungal infection fail reasonable trial license antifungal agent , either due progression lack improvement infection , Serious , severe lifethreatening toxicity relate current prior antifungal therapy , An invasive fungal infection currently effective therapy . Patients debilitate immediately life threaten fungal disease , significant morbidity may result disability prior antifungal therapy unsuccessful ( eg , chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis , recurrent oropharyngeal esophageal candidiasis dehydration malnutrition , cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis mycetoma ) . Women pregnant continue breastfeed infant . History serious severe hypersensitivity idiosyncratic reaction azole antifungal . Patients require ongoing treatment prohibit medication ( see Core Clinical Data Sheet list Prohibited Medications ) appropriate washout period elapse . Patients situation condition require use prohibit drug unstable medical condition risk therapy would exceed potential benefit i.e. , hematological disorder unstable cardiac disorder ( include acute myocardial infarction unstable myocardial ischemia/angina within 30 day , ventricular arrhythmia within 30 day , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation , atrial fibrillation/flutter symptomatic bradycardia [ sick sinus syndrome ] , unstable congestive heart failure ) impairment expect unstable progressive course study ( e.g. , recurrent uncontrolled seizure disorder , demyelinate syndrome , progressive peripheral neuropathy ) . Patients receive vinca alkaloid anthracyclines within 24 hour study enrollment require therapy vinca alkaloid anthracyclines within next 30 day treatment uncontrolled ( preexist ) malignancy require ongoing therapy vinca alkaloid anthracyclines , risk toxicity medicinal product consider significant . Any condition requiring use prohibit drug ( please consult current product labeling ) . Hepatic function test : alanine amino transferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 10 time upper limit normal , evidence severe hepatic dysfunction base clinical assessment .</criteria>
