	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) common lethal primary Brain Spinal Tumor adult . It nearly uniformly fatal , median survival approximately one year , despite modern treatment modality . Efforts understand patient live long short average may provide insight biology neoplasm . For year , researcher try identify independent predictor could help treatment planning . With recent interest molecular biology molecular genetics , tumor marker examine potential predictor . A marker could predict tumor response therapy , likelihood recurrence , survival would thus quite useful .</detailed_description>
