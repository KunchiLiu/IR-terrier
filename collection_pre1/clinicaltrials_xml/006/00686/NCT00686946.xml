	<detailed_description>The desire reproduce powerful urge basic human right woman regardless mental health status . Deinstitutionalised treatment mental illness , good pharmacotherapies , generally high expectation normal quality life potential raise incidence pregnancy woman psychosis ( Miller , Bloom &amp; Resnick , 1992 ) . The right woman mental illness become parent place responsibility upon health care professional ensure sound antenatal ongoing care available . Ethical duty care aside , good antenatal treatment appear prudent give great risk obstetric complication woman schizophrenia ( Sacker et al , 1996 ) . In meta analysis study examine outcome pregnant woman without schizophrenia , evidence exists small statistically significant increase risk low birth weight inferior neonatal condition infant schizophrenia cohort ( Sacker et al , 1996 ) . A recent meta analysis ( Webb , et al , 2005 ) summarize exposure maternal psychotic illness associate `` higher expect '' risk perinatal infant mortality , include almost twofold chance fetal death stillbirth ( p.1052 ) . Jablensky colleague ( 2005 ) discover woman whose psychiatric illness commence birth child significantly likely experience obstetric complication woman whose first admission mental illness delivery . Moreover , offspring woman schizophrenia carry increase risk develop psychosis ( Mednick , Parnas &amp; Schulsinger , 1987 ) . This observation drive neurodevelopmental hypothesis aetiology schizophrenia , posit alteration early fetal brain development utero might lead predisposition formation schizophrenia later life ( Lewis &amp; Murray , 1987 ) . Such perinatal contribution adult mental health outcome point necessity provide pregnant woman psychosis , proper specialize treatment . Despite clear argument thorough understanding need pregnant woman schizophrenia , current research limit . In particular , currently little evidence regard use antipsychotic medication pregnancy upon fetal development maternal health . Over last four decade , intermittent study seek investigate teratogenicity old typical antipsychotic upon fetal development . Earlier report generate pregnancy outcome woman treat medication hyperemesis gravidarum , woman schizophrenia ( Kerns , 1989 ) ; , difficult extrapolate initial finding across two cohort confidence . Limb defect child born woman give large dos haloperidol early pregnancy outline case report ( Goldberg &amp; Nissam , 1994 ) . Patton colleague ( 2002 ) also review three large study conclude significant increased chance exist baby expose phenothiazine develop congenital malformation , compare incidence within general population . The new second generation antipsychotic ( SGAs ) study great detail ; date , knowledge , blind randomized study examine birth outcome woman take SGAs , unlikely give ethical consideration . Prescribing guideline lay MIMS ( 2003 ) current SGAs include pregnancy `` special precaution '' despite gravity associate risk teratogenesis , publication examine atypical antipsychotic medication use pregnant woman . In review , Patton colleague ( 2002 ) cite four study outcome clozapine use , note total five case congenital abnormality report , although one infant experience low grade fever seizure , gastroesophageal reflux . Grigoriadis Seeman ( 2002 ) suggest increase risk agranulocytosis seizures baby , couple identification pregnancy clozapine potentially increase likelihood thromboembolism , render medication avoid pregnancy . Twenty-three Olanzapine-exposed pregnancy observe Goldstein colleague ( 2000 ) , find increase risk spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , prematurity major malformation . The author , however , swift assert study great sample size protract time period necessary olanzapine declare `` safe '' confidence . Thus , clinician remain conundrum ; although general today 's antipsychotic drug produce few side effect , well tolerate patient , effectively target symptoms psychosis , little evidence present reassure prescribers impact upon fetal development minimal . A proven , evidence base method achieve balance maternal mental health minimal risk fetus must research evidence . Therefore , establish The National Register Antipsychotic Medication Pregnancy ( NRAMP ) non-interventional mean provide information pregnancy outcomes woman psychosis , baby . Not NRAMP seek record large scale obstetric information prospective fashion , include pharmacotherapy pregnancy beyond , also capitalize opportunity track alteration mental health symptom woman pregnancy post partum period , gather valuable insight attitude cohort make transition parenthood . The combination poor psychosocial history , exist involvement child protection agency , psychiatric diagnosis admission , medication substance abuse , present many issue affect outcomes mother child perinatal period . Our study involve extensive collaboration many different clinical group , culminate important best-practice resource improve quality life present future generation . The identification history serious mental illness plan management strategy therefore essential improve outcome mother baby . This , drive force behind establishment The National Register Antipsychotic Medication Pregnancy ( NRAMP ) , much-needed strategy improve management serious mental illness woman become pregnant . This investigator initiate study fund Janssen-Cilag , AstraZeneca , Hospira , Lilly Australian Rotary Health Research Fund . NB : AstraZeneca provide fund include 250 consented participant . The study continue recruit .</detailed_description>
