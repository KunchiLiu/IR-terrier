	<brief_title>Effect Decision Aid Decision Making Family Member 's Disclosure Terminal Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion exclusion criterion : This study aim decrease decisional conflict among family member ready disclose patient ' terminal illness . The decision aid lead effective communication patient family effective decision make process lead final outcome improve quality life patient family . This trial limit situation family patient cognitively capable participate decision-making process . Measures : Baseline Measures . At baseline , randomization , self-reported questionnaire use collect data . To correct possible confounders study , family ' background variable assess entry study , include sociodemographic decisional conflict , decisional-role preference , stage readiness , level anxiety depression , QOL . Family decisional conflict assess use four subscales Decisional Conflict Scale assess well informed participant feel choice associate benefit risk ; clarity value ; support decision-making process ; level uncertainty . It consist 16 item follow Likert response 1 , strongly agree , 5 , strongly disagree . A mean score obtain participant . The Decisional Conflict Scale ( DCS ) translate Korean two bilingual individual , use forward-backward translation procedure , complete pilot test . Family preference role decision make assessed use scale model instrument develop Degner et al . We make family/patient dimension modify Degner Sloan 's second Control Preference Scale set , family/physician dimension . The option modify set five card ( family/patient dimension ) range family make decision mainly , collaborative model family patient jointly decide , scenario patient make decision mainly . Family ask indicate whether preferred independent role ( i.e. , `` family make final decision regard treatment patient receive consider patient 's opinion '' ) , share role ( i.e. , `` family patient together select treatment best patient '' ) , dependent role ( i.e. , `` patient alone make decision regard patient 's treatment considers family 's opinion '' ) . Family participant choose decision-role statement best describe his/her preferred role decision making . The Control Preference Scale ( CPS ) translate Korean two bilingual individual , use forward-backward translation procedure , complete pilot test . Levels family anxiety depression assess Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale consist 14 item , seven anxiety seven depression , form two sub-scales . Each item four descriptive response option score 0 3 scale . A value 0 corresponds symptom , 3 corresponds symptom high level . Scores two sub-scales construct simple summation seven item . The developer suggest sub-scale score 0-7 represent non-cases , 8-10 represent doubtful case , 11-21 represent definite case . The Baseline Patient 's Generic QOL : . Because expect effect intervention family accompany change patient ' outcome , measure patient ' QOL quality cancer care baseline observe secondary outcome related effect decision aid . Patient 's QOL assess QCQ-EOL . To correct possible confounders study , patient ' background variable obtain entry study include sociodemographic medical record . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome consider potential efficacy aid include family 's decisional conflict , satisfaction decision making , decisional-role preference , decisional regret , physician family acceptance decision aid . Family satisfaction decision making assess use effective decision-making subscale decisional conflict instrument [ O'Connor AM . Validation decisional conflict scale . Med Decis Making . 1995 Jan-Mar ; 15 ( 1 ) :25-30 ] . The subscale four item regard satisfaction decision making ( inform , reflection participant 's value , likelihood comply , satisfy ) . Scores family satisfaction reverse high score reflect high level satisfaction ( ie , reverse Likert scale 5 high score ) . A mean score obtain patient . Physician participant 's acceptance decision aid address use two questionnaire follow Likert response 1 , strongly agree , 5 , strongly disagree ( i.e. , family assessment item , `` The decision support useful reach decision '' , `` I would recommend others face decision use support '' , `` The decision support interfere relationship patient '' , Physician assessment item , `` I feel family make informed choice '' , `` The decision support useful help family understand risk benefit disclosure terminal illness '' , `` The decision support interfere anticipate physician-patient relationship patient '' ) [ Brundage et al2001 ] . Decision regret measure Decision Regret Scale useful tool measure regret decision particular point time develop O'Connor et al . It consist 5 item follow Likert response 1 , strongly agree , 5 , strongly disagree . The definition decision regret remorse distress decision [ O'Connor ] . These item whether regret felt present , whether decision right one him/her , whether he/she would make decision circumstance , whether decision wise one , whether decision result harm . The Decision Regret Scale translated Korean two bilingual individual , use forward-backward translation procedure , complete pilot test . Secondary outcome include level family anxiety depression , family 's QOL . Levels family anxiety depression assess Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale . The actual disclosure follow use material assess follow item include chosen disclosure terminal illness disclose `` , disclose patient ' terminal condition '' assess 1 , 3 , 6 month send material . Levels family anxiety depression , family decision regret , family preference role decision making , patient 's QOL assess 1 , 3 , 6 month send video .</detailed_description>
