	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) complex disease wide range clinical problem . Despite enzyme replacement therapy , child cystic fibrosis ( CF ) may still problem absorb nutrient . Detailed study nutrient status child CF find low amount choline , essential dietary nutrient , altered level amino acid almost patient . Choline essential dietary nutrient important many important body function , include prove source methyl group , structure cell membrane acetylcholine . Most choline present diet fat know phosphatidylcholine . Research study show child cystic fibrosis absorb fat , include phosphatidylcholine well . In previous study , show choline provide dietary supplement 2 week improve choline status child cystic fibrosis . The purpose research find choline supplement long duration 6 month improve maintain normal choline status child CF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choline Nutrition Children With Cystic Fibrosis ( CF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study involve 34 child attend outpatient clinic child CF . After enrollment , subject follow 9 month child serve control repeat measure design . Chart data , height , weight , pulmonary function , dietary intake venous blood urine sample collect enrollment every 3 month 9 month . Choline supplementation enrollment 6 month , follow 3 month post supplementation . To avoid additional hospital visit blood draw , co-ordinate pulmonary function , hematology , clinical chemistry test part clinical care , subject see routine schedule clinic appointment , every 3 month . The objective 1. determine supplementation choline 6 month corrects biochemical marker choline deficiency improves index reduce methylation capacity ( include methionine , SAM , SAM/SAH ) redox status ( GSH/GSSG ) base measure blood urine 2. determine whether choline supplementation decrease plasma pro-inflammatory mediator 3. determine choline supplementation improve low n-6 n-3 fatty acid level child CF , 4. explore choline supplementation potential clinical relevance reduce recurrent inflammation , improve pulmonary function and/or reduce liver disease .</detailed_description>
