	<detailed_description>Dietary calcium play pivotal role regulation energy metabolism , find high calcium diet attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion weight gain period over-consumption energy-dense diet increase lipolysis preserve thermogenesis caloric restriction , thereby markedly accelerate weight loss . Our study agouti gene demonstrate key role intracellular Ca2+ regulating adipocyte lipid metabolism triglyceride storage , increase intracellular Ca2+ result stimulation lipogenic gene expression lipogenesis suppression lipolysis , result adipocyte lipid filling increase adiposity . Moreover , increase calcitriol produce response low calcium diet stimulate adipocyte Ca2+ influx , consequently , promote adiposity , high calcium diet inhibit lipogenesis , promote lipolysis , lipid oxidation thermogenesis inhibit diet-induced obesity mouse . Notably , dairy source calcium exert markedly great effect attenuate weight fat gain accelerate fat loss . This augmented effect dairy product versus supplemental calcium likely due additional bioactive compound dairy act synergistically calcium attenuate adiposity . These concept confirm epidemiological clinical data demonstrate increase dietary calcium result significant reduction adipose tissue mass obese human absence caloric restriction markedly accelerate weight body fat loss secondary caloric restriction , dairy product exert markedly great ( nearly two-fold compare calcium supplement ) effect . These data indicate important role dairy product prevention treatment obesity . However , weight maintenance follow successful weight loss ( i.e . prevention regain ) least important strategy initially achieve weight loss , individual successfully lose weight successful maintain weight loss . We recently demonstrate ad libitum re-feeding dairy-rich follow weight loss mouse energy restrict mice prevent suppression adipose tissue lipolysis fat oxidation otherwise accompany re-feeding markedly upregulated skeletal muscle fat oxidation . Consequently , although animal re-fed low calcium diet rapidly regain weight fat lose , animal feed high calcium diet exhibit shift energy partition 50-85 % reduction weight fat gain ; moreover , dairy exert markedly great effect supplemental calcium weight fat regain . However , effect dairy prevention weight regain human yet assess clinical trial . Accordingly , goal current study determine role dairy similarly prevent weight fat re-gain obese adult successfully complete weight loss diet program . 340 obese subject undergo meal-replacement-based weight loss plan design produce 10 kg weight loss 8-12 week . Upon achieve weight loss goal , subject randomly assign either low-dairy high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance diet two year . Macronutrient distribution maintain constant set approximately U.S. average . Primary outcome include change body weight , body fat anatomical distribution fat ( via dual x-ray absorptiometry ) rest metabolic rate substrate oxidation ( via respiratory calorimetry ) ; Secondary outcome include blood pressure , circulate glucose , insulin , lipid calcitrophic hormone .</detailed_description>
