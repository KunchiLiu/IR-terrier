	<brief_title>Personalized Exercise Adolescents With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) sixth lead cause death U.S. , primarily due cardiovascular ( CV ) complication . People DM 2 4 time increase risk heart disease . An increase number adolescent diagnose DM , predispose CV morbidity mortality early adulthood . Using comparison group pretest-posttest design , Primary Aim investigation determine feasibility conduct novel personalize exercise prescription ( PEP ) intervention 20 adolescent type 1 DM 20 adolescent type 2 DM . We explore influence DM-specific family social support , exercise self-efficacy , benefit barrier exercise adherence PEP . The Secondary Aim explore possible change physiological ( i.e. , cardiorespiratory fitness , heart rate variability , metabolic control , lipid profile ) psychological outcome ( i.e. , diabetes quality life [ QOL ] ) PEP intervention adolescent type 1 type 2 DM . Long-term benefit exercise person DM include decrease risk factor CV disease , improve well-being , increased life expectancy . The current decline physical activity adolescence problematic , particularly DM , add risk future CV disease . The limited research available efficacy exercise intervention youths type 1 DM indicate improvement cardiorespiratory fitness , lipid profile , glucose regulation . No published exercise intervention research adolescent type 2 DM available . However , exercise intervention overweight youth show increased heart rate variability cardiorespiratory fitness . Although numerous study examine various school-based strategy promote physically active life youth population , study examine feasibility conduct individualize , culturally focus exercise prescription adolescent type 1 type 2 DM incorporate family support home community set . Nor study address possible psychosocial physiological outcome personalize approach . This investigation extend principal investigator 's program research identify difference CV risk adolescent type 1 vs. type 2 DM . Determining factor influence conduct outcome individualized exercise intervention adolescent DM potentially lead development program promote adherence exercise , avert complication , improve QOL overall health .</detailed_description>
