	<brief_summary>Background : The formation neuroma , fusiform swell nerve nerve end , well document response limb amputation . Likewise , Residual Limb Pain ( RLP ) , pain felt remain portion amputate limb , common among amputee . Neuromas find 90 % low extremity amputation , 30-50 % pain-generating patient . And surgical technique reveal commonly hold belief neuroma formation one causal driver behind RLP , study demonstrate two event - namely magnitude neuroma formation magnitude pain experience amputee - correlate . If correlation , lack thereof , elucidate use ultrasonography , would provide preliminary data could lead study neuroma minimization and/or proliferation . Objective : This study seek use ultrasonography ( US ) quantify degree neuroma size nature surround tissue correlate experience RLP trans-femoral amputee . Setting Subjects : This study enroll 30 trans-femoral amputee , male female , age 18 . The study take place OHSU Orthopaedic Outpatient Clinic , OHSU Imaging Department . Intervention : None . This observational clinical study characterize sciatic nerve/neuroma surround tissue use ultrasound . Measurements : We use US measure cross sectional area neuroma wide point compare cross section neuron less trochanter . Furthermore , describe morphology neuroma . To quantify subject 's pain experience utilize Questionnaire Persons Transfemoral Amputation ( Q-TFA ) , Trinity Amputation &amp; Prosthetic Experience Scale ( TAPES ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) . Analysis : The statistical analysis employ Pearson correlation coefficient linear regression analysis .</brief_summary>
