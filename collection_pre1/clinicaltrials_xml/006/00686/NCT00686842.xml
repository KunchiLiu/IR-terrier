	<brief_title>PTC299 Treating Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To define safety toxicity anti-VEGF small molecule PTC299 patient HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma . - To establish maximum tolerated dose drug patient . - To estimate response rate patient treat drug . Secondary - To describe pharmacokinetics drug patient . - To describe effect drug serum plasma VEGF , VEGFR , cytokine profile patient . - To describe effect drug HIV KSHV viral load patient . - To describe effect drug T-lymphocyte subset ( i.e. , CD4 CD8 ) patient . - To describe effect drug VEGF , VEGFR-2 -3 , phospho-Akt , p53 , HIF-1α expression tumor cell proliferation , measure Ki-67 staining , tumor biopsy sample obtain patient . - To describe effect drug viral gene expression cellular gene transcription , measure real-time quantitative PCR-based profiling , tumor biopsy sample obtain patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study anti-VEGF small molecule PTC299 follow phase II study . Patients receive oral anti-VEGF small molecule PTC299 twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate objective response Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) lesions 6 course treatment remove study . Patients undergo blood sample collection punch biopsy periodically study correlative laboratory study . Biopsy sample assess VEGF , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , phospho-Akt , KSHV LANA , orf59 , p53 , HIF-1α expression IHC ; tumor cell proliferation Ki-67 staining ; viral gene expression messenger RNA level KSHV transcription real-time quantitative PCR-based profiling . Blood sample assess pharmacokinetics level secrete cytokine potential serum marker characteristic KS . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
