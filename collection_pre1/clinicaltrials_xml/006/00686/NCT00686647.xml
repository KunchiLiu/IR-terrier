	<brief_title>AngioSculpt® Coronary Bifurcation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Bifurcation lesion , consist narrow occur branch point coronary artery , typically involve main branch ( parent vessel ) adjacent side branch . These lesion pose particularly challenging situation angioplasty procedure due difficulty cover branch stent higher rate recurrence ( restenosis ) . A new angioplasty scoring balloon catheter ( AngioSculpt® ) recently approve treatment narrowing coronary artery . The AngioSculpt® catheter incorporate nitinol device consist spiral wire wrap around balloon catheter . As balloon inflates , spiral wire score lesion allow balloon stable ( avoid slippage ) may enlarge narrowed section artery less pressure risk dissection ( uncontrolled tearing inner line artery wall commonly see conventional balloon ) . Study Purpose : To demonstrate safety efficacy AngioSculpt® use conjunction coronary stent ( implantable wire mesh tube scaffold blocked artery ) treatment coronary artery bifurcation narrowing compare result historical outcomes associate use conventional balloon stent treatment bifurcation lesion . Study Design : A prospective , multi-center , non-randomized , single-arm study result compare literature search derive historical control conventional balloon angioplasty ( OPC - Objective Performance Criteria ) . The intent study enroll treat 100 patient 8 U.S. interventional cardiology program clinical follow-up plan 30 day 9 month follow procedure .</detailed_description>

Patients significant ( &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis ) native coronary artery disease involve bifurcation ostium side branch vessel ( Medina class ( x , x , 1 ) ) include stable unstable angina silent ischemia . Patients lesion suitable percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Concomitant use Rotablator , Cutting Balloon , investigational coronary device .
