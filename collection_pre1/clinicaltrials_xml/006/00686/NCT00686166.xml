	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give oxaliplatin , capecitabine , cetuximab together radiation therapy follow surgery work treat patient stage II stage III rectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess pathologic complete response rate combination oxaliplatin , capecitabine , cetuximab alone concurrently external beam radiotherapy patient adenocarcinoma rectum , stag II III wild-type K-ras . - To estimate 3-year disease-free survival probability patient population treat regimen . - To assess frequency severity toxicity associate regimen patient . - To explore , preliminarily , association expression level gene involve DNA repair , EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , angiogenesis , 5-FU pathway ( i.e. , k-ras , TS [ Thymidylate Synthase ] , ERCC-1 [ excision repair cross complementing-1 ) , TP [ Thymidine phosphorylase ] , DPD [ Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ] , EGFR , VEGF [ vascular endothelial growth factor ] , IL-8 [ interleukin-8 ] ) pathologic complete response . ( Due advance methodology , translational medicine objective reconsider . Therefore , result objective report ) - To explore , preliminarily , intratumoral gene expression level gene completion study treatment . ( Due advance methodology , translational medicine objective reconsider . Therefore , result objective report ) - To obtain , preliminarily , data genomic polymorphisms gene correlation clinical outcome toxicity . ( Due advance methodology , translational medicine objective reconsider . Therefore , result objective report ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Neoadjuvant therapy ( course 1 ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour week 5 week , oral capecitabine twice daily 5 day week 5 week , cetuximab IV 1-2 hour week 5 week . - Neoadjuvant therapy concurrent radiotherapy ( course 2 ) : Beginning two week later , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour week week 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 . Patients also receive capecitabine cetuximab course 1 . Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week begin week 1 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 3-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Blood sample collect germline polymorphism test tissue sample collect assessed gene expression analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
