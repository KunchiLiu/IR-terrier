	<brief_summary>The objective current study show immune response subject previously vaccinate one two dos IMVAMUNE® boost two year later one IMVAMUNE® vaccination . Assessment individual antibody titer within short time interval follow booster vaccination provide information fast effective measurable antibody titer reactivate . In summary , study intend confirm single dose IMVAMUNE® reactivate antibody titer subject prim one two dos IMVAMUNE® .</brief_summary>
