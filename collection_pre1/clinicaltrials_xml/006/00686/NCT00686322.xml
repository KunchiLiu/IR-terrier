	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) With Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin LA Non-small-cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer major cause cancer death Taiwan throughout world develop develop country . More 75 % NSCLC patient inoperable either distantly metastatic disease disease confine one hemithorax one criterion unresectability time presentation . The prognosis inoperable metastatic patient poor . The benefit add chemotherapy radiation therapy stage III disease NSCLC well-established . The large prospective trial sponsor Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) , ECOG , Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) , allocate 490 patient receive 2 month cisplatin + vinblastine chemotherapy follow 60 Gy radiation 2 Gy per fraction ; one two radiation-alone arm . Overall survival statistically superior patient receive chemotherapy radiation versus two arm study ( 13.2 month vs 12 month , v 11.4 month , respectively ; p=0.04 ) . Administration chemotherapy concurrently radiation therapy theoretically improve local control sensitize tumor radiation , simultaneously treat systemic disease , albeit expense great local toxicity . Two large phase III study suggest improvement local control survival concurrent chemoradiotherapy compare sequential chemotherapy follow radiation patient stage III NSCLC . Although rate nonhematologic toxicity higher concurrent arm , median survival time trend toward superiority concomitant chemotherapy plus daily radiation arm compare sequential arm . One source debate whether addition induction consolidation chemotherapy add anything concomitant chemoradiotherapy , numerous intergroup trial underway . CALGB complete randomized phase II study two cycle induction chemotherapy follow two additional cycle drug concomitant radiotherapy . The three treatment arm include four cycle cisplatin ( 80 mg/m2 ) combine either gemcitabine , paclitaxel , vinorelbine . Radiotherapy complete last two cycle total 66 Gy . Response rate similar , median survival patient 17 month clearly superior arm evident randomize phase II trial . We propose clinical trial evaluate efficacy toxicity profile combination chemotherapy paclitaxel cisplatin previously untreated , stage IIIa/IIIb NSCLC patient receive 1 cycle induction chemotherapy , follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy , 2 cycle consolidation chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic cytological diagnosis inoperable locally advanced ( stage III ) NSCLC . No prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy . Performance status 0 2 Zubrod scale . Clinically measurable disease , define bidimensionally measurable lesion clearly define margin xray , scan , physical examination . Lesions serve measurable disease must least 1 cm 1 cm , define computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , chest xray . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate followup . Adequate bone marrow reserve : white blood cell ( WBC ) count *4,000/mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin *10 g/dL . Informed consent patient . Males females 18 year age old . If female : childbearing potential either terminate surgery , radiation , menopause , attenuate use approve contraceptive method ( intrauterine contraceptive device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device ) three month trial . Active infection ( discretion investigator ) . Inadequate liver function ( total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time normal range ) ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) great 3 time normal ( ALT AST may elevate 5 time normal patient know metastatic disease liver ) . Inadequate renal function ( creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ) . Pregnancy use appropriate birth control study . Breast feeding . Serious concomitant systemic disorder incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) . Second primary malignancy ( except situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin ) Use investigational agent month enrollment study . Patients leukemia and/or secondary primary carcinoma except patient curative therapy basal cell carcinoma . Concomitant myelosuppressive radiotherapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy allow except previously note radiation . Active cardiac disease require therapy failure , angina , and/or arrhythmia ; infarction within precede six month ( exception : patient whose cardiac failure compensate medication ) .</criteria>
