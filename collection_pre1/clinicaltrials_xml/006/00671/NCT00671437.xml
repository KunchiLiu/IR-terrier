	<brief_title>Determine Tumor Response Using Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) - Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) /Computed Tomography ( CT ) Before After Cetuximab Patients With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint To compare SUV ( standardize uptake value ) three target tumor site assess FDG-PET/CT eligible patient baseline eight week treatment cetuximab . Secondary Endpoints - To determine overall tumor metabolic response ( complete metabolic response , partial metabolic response , stable metabolic disease progressive metabolic disease [ CMR , PMR , SMD , PMD ] ) eight week schedule weekly dos cetuximab assess FDG-PET/CT perform baseline therapy . - To correlate overall tumor metabolic response ( CMR , PMR , SMD , PMD ) assess FDG-PET/CT anatomic tumor response rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease progressive disease [ CR , PR , SD , PD ] ) RECIST criterion assess CT clinical examination perform eight week schedule weekly dos cetuximab . - To correlate overall tumor metabolic response ( CMR , PMR , SMD , PMD ) assess FDG-PET/CT correlate overall anatomic tumor response ( CR , PR , SD , PD ) RECIST criterion assess CT clinical examination obtain baseline eight week treatment weekly schedule dos cetuximab TTP ( time progression ) OS ( overall survival ) cetuximab therapy . - To determine overall best anatomic tumor response rate ( CR , PR , SD , PD ) cetuximab give disease progression assess RECIST criterion use CT clinical examination . - To determine overall disease control rate ( CR , PR , SD ) RECIST criterion assess CT clinical examination determine TTP OS cetuximab therapy . - To assess toxicity profile standard care cetuximab give patient metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck .</detailed_description>
