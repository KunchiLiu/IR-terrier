	<brief_title>Trial Lymphoseek Intraoperative Localization Lymph Nodes Breast Cancer Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient primary melanoma breast cancer , lymph node status often strong predictor outcome influence course treatment patient may follow surgery . In effort reduce morbidity cost detection lymph node metastasis , surgical oncologist develop method sentinel lymph node ( first node drain basin ) identify intraoperatively remove . This technique , call sentinel node biopsy , extremely high negative predictive value melanoma metastasis breast cancer metastasis . The two large trial melanoma , Morton , et al ( 2005 ) Rossi , et al ( 2006 ) , report false negative rate 6.3 % 14.7 % , respectively . Morton , et al ( 2006 ) , perhaps mature trial report date , show false negative rate 3.4 % . There grow evidence sentinel node biopsy significant impact management melanoma . Sentinel node biopsy also extremely high negative predictive value breast cancer metastasis ; false-negative rate range 0 % 9 % . There grow evidence sentinel node biopsy significant impact management breast cancer . Although survival local recurrence study yet complete , technique emerge common practice . Lymphatic mapping radiopharmaceutical nuclear medicine examination identifies surgeon first lymph node receive lymphatic flow primary tumor site . This node remove analyzed presence malignant cell . By locate lymph node prior surgery , small incision use remove node small dissection employ . The high negative predictive value technique seem provide accurate stag procedure may spare patient lymph node negative morbidity complete lymph node dissection . Consequently , stag melanoma lymph node map biopsy may equivalent regional node dissection without attendant post surgical morbidity . An ideal lymph node imaging agent would exhibit rapid clearance injection site , rapid uptake high retention within first drain lymph node , low uptake remain lymph node . The ideal agent would also low radiation absorption ; high biological safety ; convenient , rapid , stable technetium-99m labeling ; biochemical purity . Lymphoseek ( technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-mannosyl-dextran , [ Tc-99m ] DTPA-mannosyl-dextran ) radiotracer accumulate lymphatic tissue bind mannose-binding protein resides surface dendritic cell macrophage . Lymphoseek macromolecule consist multiple unit DTPA mannose , synthetically attach 10 kilodalton dextran backbone . The mannose act substrate receptor , DTPA serve chelate agent label Tc-99m .</detailed_description>
