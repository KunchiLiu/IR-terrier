	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose lenalidomide combine Camptosar ( irinotecan ) well see drug combination help control malignant glioma . Researchers also study special magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique ( dynamic MRI scan ) useful look effect treatment tumor .

	<brief_title>Irinotecan Plus Lenalidomide Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme : Phase I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Irinotecan design stop cancer cell divide cause `` break '' tumor cell DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may cause cancer cell die . There 2 part study . In first part ( Phase I ) study , researcher try find high tolerable dose study drug combination . In second part ( Phase II ) study ( high tolerable dose reach ) , researcher try learn effectiveness study drug combination . If find eligible take part study , enrol Phase I Phase II depend part open time . Phase I : For phase , enrol group least 3 participant begin receive lenalidomide irinotecan . The dose study drug combination receive depend enrol study . At dose level , intolerable side effect occur ( 4 week ) , next 3 participant enrol receive high dose study drug combination . This process continue high tolerable dose study drug combination reach . You remain dose throughout study . You take lenalidomide mouth ( capsule ) every morning Days 1-21 28 day cycle . Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water time day . Do break , chew open capsule . In addition , also receive 1 additional dose lenalidomide mouth begin Cycle 1 ( Day 0 Cycle 1 ) . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take much lenalidomide overdose , call study doctor health care provider poison control center right away . You receive irinotecan vein 90 minute every 2 week ( Days 1 15 ) . One cycle treatment 28 day long . You `` rest '' period Days 22-28 receive study treatment . Phase II : For phase , take lenalidomide mouth ( capsule ) every morning Days 1-21 . Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water time day . Do break , chew open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take much lenalidomide overdose , call study doctor health care provider poison control center right away . You receive irinotecan vein 90 minute every 2 week Days 1 15 . One cycle treatment 28 day long . You `` rest '' period Days 22-28 receive study treatment . Some participant Phase II study may also qualify component ( subset ) study enroll 10 participant undergoing surgical resection ( removal part tissue ) tumor . If MRI scan ( do screening ) show tumor regrowth doctor recommend surgery remove regrown tumor , eligible subset study . For subset , take lenalidomide ( manner mention ) , surgery , 3 day row last dose take day surgery . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test first second day take study drug surgery day surgery . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Also , leftover tumor tissue ( remove surgery ) collect used testing learn effect lenalidomide tumor tissue . The leftover tumor tissue sample also store research tissue/blood bank last participant completes study . You standard MRI scan dynamic MRI scan within 3 day surgery . Before leftover tumor tissue sample use research , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) M. D. Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do M. D. Anderson , include research involve leftover tumor tissue sample bank , must first approve IRB . All participant : During treatment , complete physical exam brain spinal exam ( perform check coordination strength look walk pull object ) , do every one cycle Phase I every 2 cycle Phase II . On Day 1 every cycle discuss birth control method . You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon time ) routine test week Cycle 1 every 2 week cycle . You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon time ) routine test Day 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 cycle ( every one cycle Phase I every 2 cycle Phase II ) . You also dynamic MRI scan do every 2 cycle completion Cycle 2 . For woman able child : You pregnancy test perform doctor within 10 - 14 day 24 hour prior start lenalidomide therapy , even menses due treatment disease little one menstrual period past 24 month . If regular menstrual cycle , pregnancy test every week first 28 day , every 28 day take lenalidomide , stop take lenalidomide , 28 day stop take lenalidomide . If irregular menstrual cycle , pregnancy test every week first 28 day , every 14 day take lenalidomide , take lenalidomide therapy , 14 day 28 day stop take lenalidomide . Treatment study continue least 1 year , long tumor grow back intolerable side effect . Treatment beyond 1 year base whether study doctor think may benefit without severe side effect . If time treatment disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study , study doctor discus treatment option . Once completely study reason , end-of-study visit . During visit , complete physical exam , include measurement height weight . You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . You brain spinal exam . You blood draw ( 5 teaspoon ) routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . About 1 teaspoon blood drawn test ability blood clot normally . PK Biomarker test Phase I : If Phase I , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn 6 time per day Days 0 , 1 , 4 Cycle 1 PK test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn 3 time per day Days 0 , 1 4 Cycle 1 , 1 time Day 1 Cycle 2 biomarker test . Biomarkers chemical `` marker '' blood and/or tissue may relate reaction study drug . - If experience skin rash due intolerable dose study drug , punch biopsy skin perform rash area body . This tissue use test help doctor understand cause serious reaction biomarker test . To perform punch biopsy , hollow knife tool use remove small coin-shaped sample tissue . This investigational study . Lenalidomide irinotecan FDA approve commercially available treatment cancer . Their combination use investigational authorize use research . Up 51 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
