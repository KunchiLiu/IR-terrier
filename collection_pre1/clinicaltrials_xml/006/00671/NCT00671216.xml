Nonsmokers ( never smoke smoking &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 pack year history ( Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) A sign date write informed consent obtain subject The subject capable give informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form Available complete study Any clinically important abnormality identify screen medical assessment ( physical examination/medical history ) , clinical laboratory test , ECG ( 12lead ) . 24hr Holter monitoring outside normal limit . A history breathing problem ( i.e . history asthmatic symptomatology , unless asthma childhood resolve long require maintenance therapy exclusion ) . A mean QTc ( B ) value screen &gt; 450msec , ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . LBBB poorly define termination T wave ) . A history elevate rest blood pressure mean blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg screen . A mean heart rate outside range 4090 bpm screen . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . A positive test HIV antibody ( determined local SOP 's ) . History high alcohol consumption within 3months study define : average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) , defined average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) .
