	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine role nitric oxide ( NO ) asthma . We determine effect promoter polymorphism gene NO produce enzyme , nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ) , exhale NO healthy African Americans Caucasians . We compare exhale NO level African Americans Caucasians . Information race ethnicity , serum sample , blood pressure , exhale breath condensate health questionnaire collect . Three single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) identify Africans associated increase systemic NO production . These study determine whether NOS2 promoter SNPs associate difference basal exhale NO level . The study exhale NO level individual asthma confound presence cell type besides bronchial epithelium produce NO , differences severity asthma use medication corticosteroid alter exhale NO level . Therefore , study exhale NO level asymptomatic healthy African Americans Caucasians measure . The initial analysis exhale NO level indicate subset African American sample contain low level NO previous measurement exhale NO level Caucasians . Because difference exhale NO level may influence bronchodilation airway response , part study , exhale NO level African American subject compare result sample collection Caucasian sample . In addition measure exhale NO level , information race ethnicity DNA sample collect characterize sample collect African American Caucasian subject . Serum sample , measure blood pressure exhale breath condensate sample collect African Americans Caucasians control confound variable . Repeated measure exhale NO level collect control fluctuation exhale NO level relate upper respiratory infection .</detailed_description>
