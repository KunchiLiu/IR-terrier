	<detailed_description>The purpose study identify gene airway epithelial BAL cell differentially express follow inhalation house dust mite allergen among study subject allergic asthma normal phenotype . This approach design identify novel gene associate asthma pathogenesis ( differentially express exposure-response study ) asthma susceptibility ( genetically associate asthma linkage/association study ) . Patients asthma allergic rhinitis long know positive skin test response house dust . In 1960 's show dust mite important source allergen house dust . Techniques grow dust mite laboratory enable preparation dust mite allergen extract . Identification major allergen dust mite along specific skin test methodology result standardized dust mite allergen extract diagnostic therapeutic use . Numerous epidemiologic study demonstrate importance sensitization dust mite risk factor asthma allergic rhinitis symptom . Administration dust mite inhalation consider investigational . However , numerous study demonstrate safety allergen inhalation well characterized subject . A recent NHLBI/NIAID Workshop summarize evidence safety utility research bronchoprovocation bronchoscopy study subject chronic airway disease . Bronchoprovocation challenge emerge important tool understand environmental factor involve asthmatic response . Airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) , exaggerate bronchoconstrictor response variety stimulus , prominent characteristic asthma . Importantly , AHR methacholine correlate symptom severity disease . Although mechanisms underlie AHR poorly understand , believe result , least part , airway inflammation . Bronchoprovocation well-established method detect quantify AHR obtain insight mechanisms associate pathophysiologic entity . Increased airway response allergen inhalation parallel subsequent inflammatory reaction , suggest allergen-induced inflammation direct effect mechanisms airway responsiveness . Moreover , technique application bronchoprovocation , test nonspecific airway responsiveness specific allergen challenge , well define . Therefore evident bronchoprovocation test consider useful safe , also likely yield important insight pathogenesis asthma . Bronchoscopic airway sample investigational purpose also yield important insight regard pathogenesis asthma relate airway disorder . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) endobronchial brush biopsy emerge widely use invasive research tool assess inflammation tissue remodel airway interstitial lung disease . Such procedure allow airway inflammatory epithelial cell , proteins molecule interest isolate vivo manner critical understanding complex nature asthma airway disorder . Numerous report attest safety bronchoscopy include BAL brush biopsy ; report review recently joint publication NHLBI NIAID . So bronchoscopic airway sample important scientifically , consider appropriate research use normal asthmatic subject . The combination bronchoprovocation bronchoscopic airway sample thus seem ideally suit understand complex host-environment interaction asthma : environmental stimulus response specify host could trigger number reaction could measure distal airway airway epithelia .</detailed_description>
