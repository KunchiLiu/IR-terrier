	<detailed_description>The aim study ass whether energy burn daily increase bariatric surgery . Until , n't effective way measure activity daily basis . Physical Activity Monitoring System ( PAMS ) create purpose . PAMS garment worn clothes , record body position movement space . We use PAMS along special water measure total daily energy expenditure right surgery , 6 month 24 month surgery . Study subject initially recruit OHSU IRB-Approved advertisement . Interested study subject screen informal telephone interview . If health condition exclude participation , subject ask give IRB-approved consent . Subjects consent undergo three 18 day phase . Each phase consist 15 daily visit Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) , 3 full day night CTRC . The CTRC day visit 1 hour visit , subject shower , replace dirty PAMS clean PAMS , weight measure asked walk treadmill total 12 minute 3 minute 0.0 , 0.6 , 1.6 2.4 mph . Subjects ask drink special water Day 2 , daily urine sample collect 14 day . On Day 16 subject undergo series Energy Expenditure test use breath analyzer . Subjects begin lie 30 minute , sit 20 minute , stand 20 minute , transitional period stand sit 20 minute . Subjects ask walk three 15 minute interval 0.8 , 1.6 , 2.4 mph . Day 17 repeat Day 16 follow Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) BodPod ( individual 350 lb ) device use movement air measure muscle fat volume . Day 18 subject begin lie 30 minute , give breakfast eat . Their breathing test continue every 15 30 minute eat breakfast assess much energy body burn digestion , 450 minute ( 7.5 hour ) . PAMS allow physical activity measure precisely daily activity . By attach sensor ( inclinometer ) torso thigh , body posture define : Lying : torso thigh sensor indicate horizontal , Standing : torso thigh sensor indicate vertical , Sitting : torso sensor = vertical , thigh sensor = horizontal . Duplicate sensor set use subject gather duplicate data every Â½ second 14 day . The physical activity data combine breath measurement data allow u measure form activity . The following key feature ; specialize sensor ( accelerometer ) completely integrated inclinometer data body position movement continuously gather ; sensor attach subject use harness allow full range daytime nighttime physical activity well bathroom use . Data analysis simple require standard PC run Excel write macros program . Once data download , send Mayo Rochester analyze follow : - Time-spent lying , sit , stand walking , - Average accelerometer output non-walking activity ( lie , sit stand ) . - Average accelerometer output walking , - Number transition make posture ( e.g . 'sitting-to-standing ' ) . Breathing feedback use calculate , duplicate measurement Energy Expenditure ( EE ) sit , stand , transition walk 0.8 , 1.6 2.4 mph . Posture activity EE data collection . For physical activity monitoring period ( Days 2-15 ) , EE sit , stand transition calculate multiplying time engage activity ( number transition ) EE activity . Non-Exercise Activity EE = EE sit + EE stand + EE transition + EE walking . The special water measure urine collect daily . The daily urine sample ship analyzed University Wisconsin 's special instrument Dr. Schoeller 's lab . This special water ability tell u total energy expenditure whole day . The special water marker label attach water molecule . The special instrument read many water molecule possess special label . Body water excrete urine tell u person 's total daily energy expenditure .</detailed_description>
