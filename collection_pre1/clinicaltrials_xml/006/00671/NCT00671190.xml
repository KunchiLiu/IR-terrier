	<detailed_description>Circadian rhythm innate daily fluctuation physiologic behavior function , include sleep-wake state , generally tie 24-hour daily dark-light cycle . Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders share common chronophysiologic basis major feature misalignment patient 's sleep pattern sleep pattern desire regard societal norm . Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders affect sizable portion United States population , represent significant underserved need . It estimate 7 % adolescent suffer Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome . Approximately 1 % middle-aged people Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome . There 21 million people shift worker 5 % 20 % worker develop severe symptom Shift Work Sleep Disorder soon start shift work . Time Zone Change ( Jet Lag ) Syndrome affect million traveler year . Most symptoms result sleep deprivation . Current treatment disorder include behavioral therapy , light therapy use hypnotic stimulant . Melatonin also use mixed result . The effect melatonin circadian phase depend time administer , generally opposite light . Specifically , melatonin give even result advance circadian system earlier hour ( `` phase advance '' ) . While melatonin appear useful treatment sleep disruption blind , phase shift ability native melatonin much less light , limiting utility treatment circadian dysfunction sight individual . Ramelteon global development sleep-promoting agent . Ramelteon demonstrate affinity selectivity human melatonin-1 melatonin-2 receptor . Ramelteon also demonstrate full agonist activity relative melatonin cell express human melatonin-1 melatonin-2 receptor . The purpose study determine whether ramelteon give multiple day produce phase advance circadian rhythm measure salivary melatonin level dim-light condition . Participation study anticipate 4 week .</detailed_description>
