	<brief_title>A Phase II Evaluation Dasatinib ( SprycelÂ® , NSC # 732517 ) Treatment Persistent Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess CTCAE v3.0 . II . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objectives formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue treatment dasatinib . II . Explore association expression phosphorylation biomarkers involve Src signal pathway measure clinical outcome well disease status . III . Bank residual FFPE tumor tissue development characterization predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers validation thereapeutic target . IV . Objectives blood drawn and/or treatment dasatinib . V. Isolate , enumerate characterize circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) well circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) /circulating endothelial precursor ( CEP ) . VI . Prepare buffy-coat specimen residual blood remain isolation CTC CEC/CEP . VII . Explore whether CTC CEC/CEP count characteristic associated measure clinical outcome disease status . VIII . Explore whether expression phosphorylation biomarkers involve Src signal pathway CTC CEC/CEP associate measure clinical outcome disease status . IX . Explore association germline single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene involve drug metabolism , resistance DNA repair measure clinical outcome disease status . X . Bank residual DNA buffy-coat specimen development characterization predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers validation therapeutic target . XI . Objectives plasma prepared blood drawn and/or treatment dasatinib . XII . Explore association angiogenic marker cytokines include VEGF measure clinical outcome disease status . XIII . Explore association measure cell-free DNA measure clinical outcome disease status . XIV . Bank residual plasma development characterization predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers validation therapeutic target . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral dasatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
