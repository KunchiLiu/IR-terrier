	<brief_summary>The disappearance intestinal parasite human develop country may responsible upsurge many disease include Celiac Disease , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis , asthma hay fever . A parasite 's survival relies ability interfere host 's immune response . The mechanism employ similar require person regulate so-called autoimmune disorder , disease system turn . The investigator suspect parasite exclude environment , individual become sufficiently self-reactive develop autoimmune disease . American researcher successfully treat patient Crohn 's ulcerative colitis use pig whipworm ( Trichuris suis ) . The investigator undertake similar preliminary study use human hookworm Crohn 's patient . Using small group healthy people celiac disease , investigator test human hookworm , Necator americanus , inhibit immune responsiveness gluten . Celiac disease common autoimmune-like disease ( 1 % Americans affect although minority aware condition ) . In condition , individual becomes reactive gluten , protein food derive wheat , barley , oat rye . What make celiac disease good model Crohn 's disease similar immune change common , celiac disease people usually well , take powerful immune suppressive drug provocative antigen ( molecule engage immune system provoke disease ) know exclude introduce . As well direct benefit people celiac disease , study may give direction potential parasite manage inflammatory bowel disease . People proven celiac disease live Brisbane , modern Australian city , invited participate . Enrollment require candidate avoid gluten six month . The study blind study ( researcher study subject know gotten parasite ) aim compare disease activity immunity control breach gluten-free diet individual celiac disease , hookworm infection . The disease severity immune system celiac subject inoculate N. americanus examine use conventional experimental investigation . This group 's immunity compare group match , celiac control subject ( infected hookworm ) , eat four piece standard white bread day three five day . Twenty people , ten subject per arm , recruit . Ten larvae initially , five twelve week place skin light dress thirty minute . The investigator aim test whether hookworm infection change immune process suppress gluten sensitivity people celiac disease . Outcomes measured reflect activity celiac disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inoculating Celiac Disease Patients With Human Hookworm Necator Americanus : Evaluating Immunity Gluten-sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background aim : A number line evidence suggest disappearance helminth human population develop country may responsible upsurge autoimmune disease , so-called hygiene hypothesis . Using small cohort healthy subject quiescent celiac disease , aim test ubiquitous hookworm ( HW ) human , Necator americanus , inhibit immune responsiveness gluten challenge ( GC ) . As well potential benefit people gluten intolerance , study provide opportunity undertake detailed investigation mucosal level host-parasite interaction , underlie immune response , extension , potential nematode infection modulate inflammatory response IBD . Unlike experimental helminth infection either animal genetically predispose colitis clinical IBD ( range complicate cofactor present ) , study address happen healthy human background helminth exposure , currently compromise either inflammation immunosuppressive drug . Methods : Twenty healthy adult well-documented celiac disease ( DQ2 phenotype ) compliant gluten-free ( GF ) diet ≥ 6 month ( base history normal tissue transglutaminase [ tTG ] ) recruit randomly assign two group ten . Ten inoculated hookworm ( HW ) larvae 10 serve uninfected control . Study subject Investigators blind allow comparison disease activity immune profile . HW larva culture feces supply volunteer donor , previously infect purpose . Conventional endoscopy biopsy perform twice per subject , oral rectal GCs ( 2x50g slice wheat bread twice daily 3-5 day 6g gluten 40ml slurry instill rectum per endoscope , respectively ) . Rectal biopsy undertaken 4 hr duodenal biopsy collect six day follow GC ; blood collect acquire hookworm infection day six follow GC . Thus , four data set accrue comparison : ten GF celiac-subjects HW infection ; 10 GF celiac-s HW infection ; ten GC celiac-s HW infection ; 10 GC celiac-s HW infection . Safety : A large body observational data document safety experimental hookworm infection available , study others . Two researcher maintain infection include occasional `` top-up '' inoculation three year without ill effect . Outcome Measures : These include : subject symptom diary , full blood analysis , C-reactive protein , total specific IgE serum tryptase activity . The duodenal ( Marsh classification ) rectal histology grade single pathologist . Goblet cell mucosal T cell stain aid quantification response . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) mucosal lymphocytes intestinal biopsy grow ex vivo challenge gluten antigen immunodominant peptide ( alpha-gliadin 57-73 Q65E , QLQPFPQPELPYPQPQS ) . Cell proliferation cytokine profile response HW gluten antigens measure PBMCs intestinal biopsy . Varying time inoculation may provide worthwhile direction importance Th2 response profound difference newly establish ( Th2-dominant ) versus mature ( Th-neutral ) parasite infection , suggest earlier work experimental human infection . Levels transcription gene interest assess use quantitative real time PCR microarrays . Outcomes : The null hypothesis Necator americanus change immune process sufficiently suppress gluten sensitivity people celiac disease . The measured outcome reflect activity celiac disease , include severity mucosal inflammation , character intensity immune process . This study though much IBD . Celiac disease IBD , model IBD afford previously unexplored opportunity test quasi autoimmune response duodenum rectum specific antigen , one introduce excluded demand . The immune profiling focus characteristic drive inflammation IBD provide clear insight potential helminth Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Extension Study ; Control patient invite enroll extension study ; inoculate , challenge investigate per original hookworm cohort ( ) . Low dose gluten challenge Study : This trial extension seek establish hookworm infection might improve tolerance small amount gluten patient celiac disease . The study open . It utilise celiac patient already infect hookworm blood mucosal baseline characteristic carefully document . The gluten exposure apply dos demonstrate others trial set safe well-tolerated . Effectiveness hookworm infection mitigate gluten intolerance measure quantifiable change occur biopsy previously take ( pre-challenge ) compare tissue collect post-challenge.Histology perform previously describe . Biopsies fix neutral buffer formalin , process carefully orientate embed paraffin wax . Sections ( 3 μm ) stain haematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) immunostained anti-CD8 ( anti-CD3 depend availability ) antibody ( Novocastra Laboratories Ltd ) . The intraepithelial lymphocyte ( IELs ) per 100 nucleated enterocytes ( 100NE ) count 24 randomly select site villous tip base crypt ( Vh/Cd ) biopsy . Individual collective outcome tissue collect hookworm infection , whilst gluten free diet , compare tissue collect pasta challenge .</detailed_description>
