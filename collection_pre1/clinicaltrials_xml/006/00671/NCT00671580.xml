	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential effect safety two different dos PZ-601 compare another antibiotic approve US Food Drug Administration ( also know FDA ) treat adult skin skin structure infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Potential Efficacy , Pharmacokinetics PZ-601 Treatment Complicated Skin Skin Structure Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PZ-601 novel investigational carbapenem antibiotic antimicrobial spectrum activity include pathogen responsible community-acquired bacterial infection well multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogen - MRSA vancomycin-resistant enterococci . PZ-601 also activity Gram-negative organism include cephalosporin quinolone resistant Enterobacteriaceae well Bacteriodes fragilis peptostreptococci . Based antimicrobial profile , PZ-601 potentially promising agent treatment complicate skin skin structure infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent provide patient 2 . Males females ≥ 18 year age 3 . Diagnosis complicate skin skin structure infection define infection meet follow criterion : Suspected cause bacterial pathogen , include multidrug resistant organism MRSA , Involves deep soft tissue and/or require significant surgical intervention : major abscess infect burn ( less equal 20 % body surface area ) traumatic wound infection deep/extensive cellulitis surgical wound infection infect ulcer ( exception multiple infected ulcer distant site . ) Please Note : Patients multiple site skin infection may enrol study . The severely affected site one likely yield positive culture choose follow throughout course evaluation . 4 . Presents least TWO follow local symptom : Purulent seropurulent drainage/discharge Erythema Fluctuance Heat/Localized Warmth Pain/tenderness palpation Swelling/induration 5 . At least ONE follow systemic sign infection Increased Temperature ( ≥100.4ºF/≥38.0ºC ) measure orally equivalent ( note : method obtain temperature acceptable ) WBC ( &gt; 10,000 cells/mm3 ) Immature neutrophil ( &gt; 10 % band form regardless total peripheral white count ) 6 . Require initial hospitalization least 7 day parenteral therapy treatment suspect cSSSI infection 7 . Ability obtain culture Gram stain cSSSI site within 48 hour prior initiation study medication ; 1 . Female patient pregnant , lactate ( breast milk feeding ) , plan pregnancy course study , child bear potential use acceptable method birth control ( ie , surgically sterile , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive plus barrier contraceptive , hormone delivery system plus barrier contraceptive condom combination contraceptive cream , jelly foam ) 2 . Received 24 hour systemic antibiotic therapy within 96 hour initiation study medication current episode cSSSI , unless : evidence clinical failure follow least 48 hour prior , nonstudy systemic therapy OR microbiological evidence failure ( ie , Gram stain reveals WBC least one potential pathogen isolation organism resistant prior therapy ) 3 . Concomitant condition require antimicrobial therapy would interfere evaluability condition study 4 . Anticipated need prolong antibiotic therapy ( ie , &gt; 14 day ) 5 . Topical use antimicrobial ( exclude vaginally topically administer antifungal agent ) 6. cSSSI know suspect caused fungal , parasitic viral infection 7. cSSSI follow category : infect diabetic foot ulcer decubitus ulcer multiple infect ulcer distant site involve ischemic ulcer due peripheral vascular disease presence gangrene etiology 8 .

Superinfected eczema chronic medical condition ( eg , atopic dermatitis , hidradentitis suppurativa ) characterize prominent sign inflammation extend period even successful bacterial eradication 12 . Patients undergone two surgical intervention ( define surgery perform bedside ) treatment cSSSI time enrollment 13 . Patients expect require two surgical intervention ( define surgery perform bedside ) treatment cSSSI first 48 hour follow study enrollment 14 . Infections complicate presence prosthetic material remove permanent intracardiac device joint replacement prosthesis 15 . Moderately severely impaired renal function know creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ( base CockcroftGault formula use ideal body weight ) 16 . ALT AST &gt; 3x upper limit normal bilirubin &gt; 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 17 . Neutropenia define absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3 18 . Thrombocytopenia define platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 19 . Infection human immunodeficiency virus CD4 count know time enrollment &lt; 200 cells/mm3 another Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) define illness 20 . Requiring concomitant administration systemic corticosteroid great 40 mg/day prednisolone ( equivalent ) 21 . Treatment cancer chemotherapy , radiotherapy , potent , noncorticosteroid immunosuppressant drug ( eg , cyclosporine , azathioprine , tacrolimus , immunemodulating monoclonal antibody therapy , etc . ) within 3 month prior study enrollment 22 . Concomitant therapy medication know low seizure threshold patient history seizure disorder 23 . Concomitant therapy medication know associated QTc prolongation potential ( eg , Class IA Class III antiarrhythmic agent ) 24 .
