	<detailed_description>The `` homocysteine-hypothesis '' vascular disease attract considerable interest , total plasma homocysteine level easily lower folic acid vitamin B12 , raise prospect cardiovascular disease could lower B-vitamin supplementation . Two large B-vitamin intervention trial perform Norway period 1998 2005 , NORVIT WENBIT , register ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT00266487 NCT00354081 , respectively . The main objective trial study effect homocysteine-lowering therapy folic acid vitamin B12 reduce risk cardiovascular event patient establish coronary artery disease . The B-vitamin intervention , include vitamin B6 2x2 factorial design , identical two trial . Follow-up terminate NORVIT March 31st 2004 WENBIT October 5th 2005 . Results NORVIT trial publish April 2006 { Bonaa , 2006 } preliminary result WENBIT trial present annual congress European Society Cardiology September 4th 2007 { Zegers , 2007 } . The WENBIT trial complete submit publication early year 2008 . So far , none B-vitamin intervention trial show statistically significant favourable effect homocysteine-lowering therapy folic acid without concomitant vitamin B12 cardiovascular event { Bazzano , 2006 } . In NORVIT even trend towards increase risk cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction ) patient receive combination folic acid , vitamin B12 vitamin B6 . This trend observe WENBIT . However , treatment folic acid / B12 associate With rapid progression angiographic coronary atenoses { LÃ¸land , 2010 } . Thus , `` homocysteine-hypothesis '' vascular disease attenuate emergence negative trial result , whereas potential harmful effect B-vitamin intervention reveal . There far data possible long-term effect follow year B-vitamin supplementation . By combine analysis follow-up NORVIT WENBIT cohort , probably answer consider possible subgroup long-term effect B-vitamin intervention . Current data indicate folate prevents cancer , especially breast colorectal cancer . However , last year several report challenge assumption . Swedish observational study find increase risk colorectal cancer high blood folate level { Van Guelpen , 2006 } increase risk prostate cancer high level folate vitamin B12 { Hultdin , 2005 } . In randomised trial folic acid versus placebo prevent colorectal adenoma , one found increase risk cancer group receive folic acid , especially prostate cancer { Cole , 2007 } . In long-term follow-up woman take high dos folic acid throughout pregnancy one found double risk death attributable breast cancer { Charles , 2004 } . Recently hypothesize implementation folic acid fortification food may wholly partly responsible observed increase colorectal cancer rate USA Canada mid late 1990s { Mason , 2007 } . This lead new hypothesis folate may prevent carcinogenesis may enhance growth establish cancer cell { Ulrich , 2007 } . The question possible adverse effect folic acid supplementation major importance public health administration decide whether implement enhance program folic acid fortification food . The effect B-vitamin intervention also study relation life-style disease like diabetes osteoprosis . Additionally , combine NORVIT-WENBIT cohort use observational study evaluate new risk phenotype genotypes potential effect modification B-vitamin intervention .</detailed_description>
