	<brief_summary>The well establish importance regular aspirin administration stand firm ground , large meta-analyses show therapy significantly reduce risk death . However , patient benefit aspirin administration extent , thus high-lighting sub-population patient inadequate platelet response ASA . The mechanism underlie reduce ASA efficacy remain elusive . A recent report suggest platelet , long believe incapable de novo protein synthesis , may retain ability form cyclooxygenase enzyme , inactivate aspirin . This may explain inefficacy drug induce sustain platelet inhibition certain patient . The current study aim evaluate , patient suffer stable coronary artery disease , stability platelet inhibition aspirin normal daily dose regimen .</brief_summary>
