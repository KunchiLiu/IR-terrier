	<brief_summary>Subjects newly diagnose brain tumor undergo surgical resection whose pathology operate room show high grade glioma eligible . During screen visit , study discuss , inform consent discuss sign , medical history take physical examination laboratory test perform . If test within acceptable range , subject consider inclusion treatment protocol . If result test extremely different normal expect value , she/he may able participate . Prior surgery , subject contrast enhance MRI MRS . The neurosurgeon attempt remove majority tumor operate room send portion specimen remove pathologist immediately . This call `` frozen section '' . If pathologist believe tumor high-grade malignant brain tumor , surgeon place 8 dime-sized chemotherapy wafer tumor cavity brain . The remainder tumor specimen give pathologist review closely laboratory . If frozen section show tumor high-grade malignant brain tumor , subject receive Gliadel wafer remove study . The surgeon discus subject appropriate treatment option disease . During recovery hospital , another contrast enhance MRI perform within first 72 hour surgery . This standard care patient involve protocol well . The subject another contrast enhance MRI MRS perform 21st Day surgery . After Day 21 , He may begin form treatment . The last contrast enhance MRI MRS assessment perform 12 week surgery implantation Gliadel wafer . Further MRI MRS may perform subsequently discretion doctor . Throughout course treatment , clinical data collect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient &gt; 17 year age . Patients document histologic diagnosis high grade malignant glioma intraoperative frozen section squash preparation . Solitary , supratentorial lesion cross midline Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; =60 % ( equivalent ECOG level 02 ) ( see Appendix A ; Performance Status Evaluation ) expect survival &gt; three month . Patients must adequate hematologic reserve WBC &gt; =3000/mm3 , absolute neutrophil &gt; =1500/mm3 platelet &gt; =100,000/ mm3 . Preenrollment chemistry parameter must show : bilirubin &lt; 1.5X institutional upper limit normal ( IUNL ) ; AST ALT &lt; 2.5X IUNL creatinine &lt; 1.5X IUNL . Patients must agree use medically effective method contraception period three month treatment period . A pregnancy test perform premenopausal female childbearing potential immediately prior entry research study . Patients must able understand give write informed consent . Informed consent must obtain time patient screening . Known hypersensitivity allergy BCNU ( carmustine ) component GliadelÂ® wafer , polifeprosan polymer . Multifocal CNS disease Diagnosis prior CNS tumor Women pregnant lactating . Posterior Fossa Brain stem tumor Open communication resection cavity ventricular system tumor cross midline . Concurrent severe medical ( e.g. , active infection , acute hepatitis , cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled seizure , pulmonary insufficiency , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary embolus , etc ) psychiatric illness , abnormal laboratory value preclude surgical candidacy limit expect survival less 12 week . If doubt , contact Study Principal Investigator . Patients significant intercurrent medical psychiatric condition would place increased risk affect ability receive comply treatment posttreatment clinical monitoring .</criteria>
