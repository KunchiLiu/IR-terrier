	<brief_title>A Family Intervention Improving Self-Care Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives ( ) : We plan conduct feasibility pilot trial Family Partnership Intervention ( FPI ) compare patient HF Wait-list ( WL ) condition . We plan demonstrate feasibility , estimate variance major outcome variable , obtain preliminary estimate effect size preparation subsequent grant application . We able develop cost-effectiveness model relative benefit FPI vs. family-based use longer-term study . 2 . Research Design : This short-term , randomized clinical trial involve assessment participant FPI condition pre-intervention Baseline point , immediately post-intervention , 6 month post-intervention . Participants WL condition assess Baseline , undergo approximately 8 week wait period , FPI . A longer follow-up plan base purpose study feasibility trial . 3 . Methodology : We plan randomize 40 Veterans family member either FPI condition WL condition , equal proportion . We recruit patient least Stage C Heart Failure ( NYHA class I - IV ) Cardiology clinic Philadelphia VAMC . FPI involve 4-6 hour intervention deliver period 6-8 week . Assessments pre-treatment baseline point , 8 week ( immediately post-treatment ) , 6 month cover follow domain : ) patient ' demographic characteristic clinical functioning , b ) self-care , include self-management symptom , knowledge HF , adherence medication dietary intake sodium , c ) measure family function relevant medical care patient , ) health care utilization cost . Primary outcome measure patient ' self-reported HF self-care health care utilization cost . We anticipate patient FPI condition exhibit well self-care time compare patient WL condition . We also anticipate patient family member exhibit improved family environment well HF knowledge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Stage C Heart Failure , [ 34 ] refers past current symptom heart failure underlie structural heart disease . Indicated chronic systolic dysfunction ( left ventricle [ LV ] ejection fraction &lt; 45 % ) , diastolic dysfunction ( echo evidence diminish compliance LV ) , . 2 . The patient 's cardiologist recommend initiated one follow prevent decompensation : continue diuretic treatment , fluid restriction , and/or restriction/reduction dietary sodium intake . 3 . A family member member available study participation patient live least 5 day week . Emphasis give close family member available ( i.e. , spouse ) . 4 . Subjects able give inform consent ( see exclusion due welldocumented dementia evidence cognitive impairment ) . 5 . Patients age 50 . Younger patient may different family environment common type patient target FPI intervention . 1 . Patient welldocumented diagnosis dementia 2 . Moderate great cognitive impairment , base Blessed Test Orientation , Memory , Concentration ( BOMC ) [ 26 ] score 16 . 3 . Patient 's family member BOMC score 10 ( i.e. , mild great cognitive impairment ) . 4 . Inability communicate verbally , major visual impairment , uncorrected hearing loss . 5 . Patient and/or family member report `` frequent use '' illicit substance abuse within past year . Scores AUDITC 4 indicate alcohol abuse/dependence . [ 30 ] 6 . Patient family member current diagnosis schizophrenia spectrum psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder ) . 7 . Patient indicate active suicidal ideation evaluate clinical risk . 8 . Patient Philadelphia VAMC hometelehealth program incompatible intervention . 9 . Patient unstable medical condition would likely prevent subject complete study .</criteria>
