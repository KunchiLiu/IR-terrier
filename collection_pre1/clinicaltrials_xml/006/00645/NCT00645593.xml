	<brief_title>Study Gemcitabine Cisplatin With Without Cetuximab Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urothelial cancer typically begin line bladder , balloon-shaped organ pelvic area store urine . Urothelial cancer also begin ureter ( tube connect kidney bladder ) , part kidney , urethra ( tube pas urine ) . Some Urothelial cancer remain confined lining , case spread area . Treatment cancer varies greatly depend stage disease time diagnosis . Study participant research study diagnosis urothelial cancer advance come back prior therapy . There two standard chemotherapeutic regimen management disease . One combination drug , methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , cisplatin ( MVAC ) . However toxicity associate treatment regimen ( side effect ) high . The combination two drug call Cisplatin Gemcitabine . These drug also know destroy urothelial cancer cell , well tolerate patient . All study participant receive drug . Another anti-cancer drug call Cetuximab know delay prevent tumor growth case lead death cancer cell block certain cellular pathway lead tumor development . This drug approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment colorectal cancer treatment head neck cancer . The use Cetuximab treatment urothelial cancer investigational study . The purpose study compare safety efficacy Gemcitabine Cisplatin administer without addition Cetuximab study participant urothelial cancer . This randomize research study . Study participant randomize receive either gemcitabine cisplatin alone combination Cetuximab .</detailed_description>
