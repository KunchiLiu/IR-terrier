	<brief_summary>Muscle waste common advanced chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) adversely affect morbidity mortality . In 2/3 male advance CKD serum testosterone ( TT ) level reduce , likely contributes waste . As TT relatively safe physiologic replacement dos , increase muscle mass otherwise normal TT deficient subject , hypothesize physiologic TT replacement effective prevent treat loss muscle mass function CKD patient , improve quality life may reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor .</brief_summary>
