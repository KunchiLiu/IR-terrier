	<brief_title>Do Group Insulin Education Visits Reduce Barriers Insulin Initiation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes common , morbid expensive disease among veteran . Achieving maintain adequate glycemic control reduce devastate complication diabetes . Unfortunately large percentage veteran type 2 diabetes continue poorly control blood sugar . Insulin potent medication reduce glycemia , use often enough due barrier patient provider drive . We propose conduct pilot study evaluate feasibility establish insulin education group would serve educate patient insulin , initiate insulin group set , provide appropriate follow-up start insulin . If intervention successful , plan develop multicenter study test rigorously effect approach . Specific Aims : To determine psychological barrier insulin initiation patient uncontrolled type 2 diabetes favorably affect group insulin education insulin initiation visit , measure Barriers Insulin Treatment ( BIT ) Questionaire intervention . To evaluate feasibility intervention measure percent patient refer class , either cancel without reschedule fail report percent patient begin insulin . To evaluate safety intervention measure proportion patient experience hypoglycemic symptom ; proportion patient require sugar intake manage hypoglycemia ; proportion patient require assistance manage hypoglycemia .</detailed_description>
