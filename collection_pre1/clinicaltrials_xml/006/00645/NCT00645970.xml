	<brief_summary>We believe information obtain propose study prove critical planning future VA healthcare strategy develop effective efficient treatment target pain emotional adjustment difficulty among individual polytrauma return Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) personnel . More specifically , study first provide systematic data regard pain emotional problem prevalence , course , associated impairment , risk factor , barrier care community reintegration among return OEF OIF service member without polytrauma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Overview : This clinically-oriented study utilize observational cohort design compare cross sectional baseline sample polytrauma non-polytrauma OEF/OIF military personnel two site ( Minneapolis Tampa VAs ) three time point ( baseline 6 12 month post-enrollment ) . With relatively large sample size employ study , cross sectional baseline sample exist patient longitudinal design allow u evaluate association injury time onset pain emotional distress symptom . The employment two four exist PRCs study site facilitate recruitment sufficient study participant enhance generalizability result . The multiple time point allow u track course pain , emotional problem , associate disability 12-month period , identify onset new pain emotional symptom participant 12-month monitoring period . Most study procedure measure utilized prior clinical research effort patient population . Subjects Sampling Strategy : Two non-stratified sample participant recruit study site . A polytrauma injury group ( PTR ) comprise 150 200 inpatient former inpatient return additional rehabilitation care Minneapolis Tampa PRCs ( ns = 75-100 site ) . PTR subject subdivide combat polytrauma ( 60 % base current data ) non-combat polytrauma ( 40 % ) select subsequent analysis . A comparison group 300 400 non-polytrauma OEF/OIF service member ( NPTR ) sample randomly pool veteran Minneapolis Tampa OEF/OIF patient registry ( ns = 150-200 site ) . This latter group dichotomize pain ( NPTR-P ; approximately 42 - 50 % base previous research ) without ( NPTR-NP ) later analysis . Sample Size Determination : The sample size base analysis power detect significant ( .05 ) difference proportion pain PTSD present sample cohort baseline ( H1 ) . For pain , use estimate pain disorder prevalence among polytrauma ( 80 % ) non-polytrauma ( 46 % ) service member base pain complaint frequency find prior studies,1 , 34 group size 150 ( polytrauma ) 300 ( non-polytrauma ) , associated power would approach 1.0 . For PTSD , utilize sample size prior research-based estimate PTSD prevalence rate 48 % ( polytrauma ) 32 % ( non-polytrauma ) , power detect difference group would approach .91 . If time allow , recruit maximum 200 PTR 400 NPTR participant counter reduce power due attrition 12-month follow , increase precision estimate the12-month incidence pain emotional symptom previously symptom-free individual , retain adequate power subgroup analysis . Inclusionary Criteria - ) PTR group . To participate study , PTR subject must : 1 ) deploy Iraq Afghanistan October 2001 present ; 2 ) meet VA definition polytrauma injury ; 3 ) receive medical clearance participate attend physician ; 4 ) able provide valid self-report pain level use 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale ; 5 ) fluency verbal write English ; 6 ) attain Rancho Los Amigos 35 ( scale cognitive impairment routinely use PRCs ) level 6 ( moderate impairment ) great ; 7 ) competent provide full informed consent . Individuals attain Rancho level exceed 5 treatment eligible participation experience incapable provide full informed consent reliable pain score unable complete study self report measure . These criterion select maximize generalizability minimize probability include polytrauma participant unable provide valid self-report data . Based prior work area,1 , 34 approximately 70 % PRC patient attain Rancho level 6 great able provide valid pain score treatment . Participants may enrol point treatment provide meet criterion . The rationale allow enrollment throughout treatment stem special characteristic PTR group . More specifically , polytrauma inpatient often admit large dos opioid analgesic may limit ability provide reliable self-reports pain , particularly also experienced TBI . As opioid dosage titrate order promote increase involvement rehabilitation , may able provide valid pain rating . Secondly , cognitive function soldier significant cognitive limitation typically improve substantially treatment,1 , 34 sometimes dramatically . If limit participation able provide valid self-reports pain symptom time admission would restrict pool potential participant substantially reduce generalizability clinical utility study . Because focus treatment effect , use cross-sectional baseline sample approach control time since injury , approach bias obtain data . b ) NPTR group . Criteria NPTR participation include : 1 ) deployment Iraq Afghanistan October 2001 present ; 2 ) fluency verbal write English ; 3 ) ability provide valid self-report pain level use 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale ; 4 ) competency give full inform consent . This comparison group include participant meet polytrauma criterion sample eligible member registry participate VA facility . Participants meet criterion enrol one-year . Women minority recruit extent present associate participant pool , oversampled . Participants receive token payment $ 30 follow complete assessment session order defray travel expense time investment . Estimated Participation Rates Participant Pool Size . Based experience recruit participant prior chronic pain , polytrauma , OEF/OIF study clinical evaluation , anticipate least 80 % meet study criterion agree participate . Therefore , order meet minimum recruitment goal need least 280 individual polytrauma ( 280 X 67 % able provide pain rating X 80 % participation rate = 150 ) . In past 12 month , total 490 individual admit return Minneapolis ( n=289 ) Tampa ( n=201 ) PRCs , suggest adequate pool participant polytrauma . Minimum recruitment goal OEF/OIF soldier without polytrauma require participant pool least 376 individual ( 376 X 80 % participation rate = 300 ) . As May 1st , 2007 , 3723 OEF/PIF returnees Minneapolis OEF/OIF registry , 4099 Tampa patient registry .</detailed_description>
