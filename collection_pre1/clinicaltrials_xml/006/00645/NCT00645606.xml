	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether give rituximab alone chemotherapy rituximab effective chemotherapy rituximab follow observation treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give fludarabine together cyclophosphamide rituximab follow rituximab alone see well work compare give fludarabine together cyclophosphamide rituximab follow observation treat old patient previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To demonstrate superiority , term 3-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) , rituximab maintenance observation patient complete partial response ( CR PR ) induction therapy comprise fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab . Secondary - To determine event-free survival , disease-free survival , overall survival , time next treatment , time randomization . - To determine overall response rate ( CR PR ) accord NCI criterion . - To assess rate phenotypic response ( minimal residual disease ) . - To assess duration phenotypic NCI clinical response . - To determine response rate time-related parameter biological subgroup . - To determine rate treatment-related adverse event . - To evaluate CD4/CD8 count , immunoglobulin level , incidence Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia . - To study pharmacokinetics rituximab induction maintenance . - To evaluate prognostic impact immunoglobulin FcγRIIIA genotype . - To assess quality life . - To study pharmacoeconomics . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response induction therapy ( complete response [ CR ] vs partial response [ PR ] ) , IgV_H mutational status , 11q deletion . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 14 course 1-2 day 1 course 3 4 . Patients also receive oral fludarabine phosphate oral cyclophosphamide daily day 2-4 course 1 day 1-3 course 2-4 . Courses repeat every 28 day . Patients achieve CR PR randomize 1 2 maintenance arm recover toxicity . - Arm A : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 month absence disease progression maximum duration 24 month ( 12 infusion ) . - Arm B : Patients undergo observation . Patients undergo lymphocyte sample collection biological study include diagnostic immunophenotyping , Matutes score ( CD38 , CD20 , CD43 ) , ZAP-70 analysis , standard karyotyping , cytogenetic screen FISH ( 17p13 deletion , 11q22 deletion , 13q14 deletion , trisomy 12 ) , IgV_H mutational status , serum thymidine kinase , FcγRIIIA genotyping , pharmacokinetic study . Samples frozen store late study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
