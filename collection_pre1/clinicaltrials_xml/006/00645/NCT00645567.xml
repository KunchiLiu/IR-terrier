	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : The purpose 3 year laboratory-based randomize crossover study evaluate ergonomic effectiveness four wheelchair/vehicle transfer assistive device , include ( 1 ) standard transfer board , ( 2 ) Glide n ' Go , ( 3 ) Easy Reach Lift , ( 4 ) Ryno Lift , compare unassisted manual transfer . We target person paraplegia ( level injury T2-L5 ) standardize physical capability . Our research question : 1 . Evaluate impact vehicle/wheelchair transfer objective measure shoulder kinematics , kinetics , muscle activity , participant . 2 . Evaluate impact vehicle/wheelchair transfer subjective measure shoulder pain , spasticity , perceive comfort , ease , efficiency , safety . 3 . Examine effect covariates ( patient characteristic , SCI characteristic pain ) objective subjective outcome measure . Background : Upper limb pain injury highly prevalent person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) use manual wheelchair mobility . Historically , person paraplegia long survive trauma injury , advance medicine emergency service , person SCI life expectancy approach general population . For person paraplegia , paralysis lower limb necessitates reliance upper limb perform wheelchair propulsion , transfer in/out wheelchair , mobility-related task . Many year overuse upper extremity lead increased incidence pain cumulative trauma shoulder , elbow wrist . Over 50 % person SCI upper extremity pain ; rotator cuff tear report 59-73 % ; 40 % clinical evidence carpal tunnel syndrome . Upper extremity deterioration follow year compensate lack functional low limbs addition usual loading reduces quality life , function , independence , even life expectancy follow SCI . The two stressful mobility task perform person paraplegia wheelchair propulsion wheelchair transfer . Several investigator examine upper extremity kinematics ( joint motion ) kinetics ( joint force torque ) , muscle activity determine electromyography ( EMG ) among individual SCI wheelchair propulsion . Comparatively study address wheelchair transfer none offer integrate kinematic , kinetic EMG approach simultaneously examine joint angle , moment muscle activity . Methods : Using Vicon motion analysis technology , propose laboratory-based randomized evaluation five vehicle transfer approach : unassisted manual transfer , standard transfer board , Glide n'Go , Easy Reach lift , Ryno lift . The select commercially-available product represent range assistive technology presently available task . A sample 58 veteran paraplegia , use manual wheelchair mobility , recruit participate study . Subjects recruit Tampa VA Hospital mean poster advertisement . Participants complete data collection activity one four-hour session , compensate . Subjects ask perform series five randomize wheelchair-to-vehicle transfer task . Vicon marker place participant 's body capture positional data . Dynamic external load exert transfer task measure use AMTI MC3A tri-axial load cell strategically mount vehicle mock-up . EMG record bilaterally major muscle group . Participants complete subjective rating scale upon completion transfer . The result study use develop clinical algorithm assist clinician selection appropriate assistive technology person disability use manual wheelchair mobility . This algorithm facilitate individualize selection assistive technology minimize risk injury maximize patient compliance , comfort , satisfaction . The ultimate goal program research ( 1 ) promote successful adaptation age disability , ( 2 ) reduce morbidity mortality associate wheelchair use , ( 3 ) enhance health-related quality life , patient freedom , function , independence , confidence , ( 4 ) reduce healthcare utilization associate cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>level SCI limit ASIA A classification T2 L5 level standardize physical capability , SCI least 2 year ( neurologically stable , use rigid manual wheelchair primary mean mobility , able selfpropel wheelchair , able independently transfer wheelchair vehicle , age 1865 , live community within 100 mile Tampa VA hospital , able follow simple instruction , free acute upper extremity injury least six month ( determine chart review ) minimize risk injury task performance , comparable bilateral functional range motion strength shoulder , elbow wrist ( determined physical evaluation ) minimize risk injury task performance . Candidates present : progressive disease ( e.g . spinal tumor ) , extend bedrest 30 day , ventilatordependent , cardiac respiratory condition would limit subject 's physical performance , unstable medical condition , use power wheelchair scooter primary mean mobility , pregnancy , clinical evidence severe musculoskeletal disorder upper extremity preclude participate study .</criteria>
