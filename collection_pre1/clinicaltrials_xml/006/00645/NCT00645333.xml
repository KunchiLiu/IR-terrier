	<brief_summary>New good therapy locally advance metastatic breast cancer need , even standard treatment successful shrinking cancer , still high chance cancer recur . Recent research suggest breast tumor small number cell `` breast cancer stem cell '' , resistant standard treatment . It think reason many patient cure breast cancer stem cell unable kill remain body standard treatment . Laboratory research show new drug , MK-0752 , target stem cell prevent tumor recurrence drug combine docetaxel , chemotherapy drug commonly use treat breast cancer . We know MK-0752 safe give people . We know treatment MK-0752 docetaxel combine safe kill `` breast cancer stem cell '' people breast cancer . This clinical trial do determine safety several dose MK-0752 combination docetaxel . Preliminary data effectiveness MK-0752 combination docetaxel collect . Also , tumor biopsy sample take patient tumor easily biopsied . The sample use perform research test help determine `` breast cancer stem cell '' kill drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study MK-0752 Followed Docetaxel Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose—Accumulating evidence support existence breast cancer stem cell ( BCSCs ) , characterize capacity self-renew divide indefinitely , resistance conventional therapy . The Notch pathway important stem cell renewal , potential target BCSC-directed therapy . Experimental Design—Using human breast tumorgraft study , evaluate impact gamma secretase inhibitor ( GSI ) BCSC population efficacy combine GSI docetaxel treatment . The mouse experimental therapy parallel concurrent clinical trial advance breast cancer patient , design determine maximally tolerate dose GSI , MK-0752 , administer sequentially docetaxel , evaluate BCSC marker serial tumor biopsy .</detailed_description>
