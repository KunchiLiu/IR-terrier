	<brief_summary>A study complex genetics brain development undertaken emphasis gene cause common structural brain anomaly human call holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) . This malformation brain result either environmental genetic cause , aim investigation determine gene responsible normal abnormal brain development study patient disorder . Mutations one gene , Sonic Hedgehog , show u responsible approximately one quarter familial case HPE . Other gene either related hedgehog pathway locate unrelated define genetic locus may also contribute HPE subject active investigation . We anticipate many gene important normal brain development identify search genetic cause HPE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) cover nearly continuous spectrum midline abnormality range unmistakable cyclopia absence forebrain separation mild microforms , single central incisor . The objective study identify genetic factor ( cod non-coding ) contribute pathogenesis holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) relate brain malformation . Our approach involve common genetic strategy include mutational analysis candidate gene . All individual overt subtle clinical finding consistent HPE spectrum eligible participate . Mutational analysis entire cod collection HPE probands ( approximately 600 case ) select gene principal research method use determine give candidate gene commonly mutate HPE . This approach pertain individual gene ( ) genetic element ( ) well targeted capture panel study gene set hundred developmental gene whose involvement brain development support basic research literature . We also ask include option investigate entire set genetic factor present DNA RNA patient HPE propose change consent document . Whenever sequence variant identify , present commercially available control set sample , attempt make test functional significance change protein , expression . Sequence change strong probability medically significant verify CLIA-approved lab ( e.g . Muneke lab , select gene , GeneDx ) expense , result give family genetic counseling . Parental DNA ( rarely sibling ) usually obtain time proband enrol . Typically , sample study perform limit family study sequence variant potential medical significance already determine . Participation direct blood relative encourage since virtually bone fide mutation either family-specific de novo . Such family information critical research determination genetic risk factor accurate genetic counseling . The majority subject enrol study continue care local physician genetic counselor limit contact NIH investigator . Only rarely family see NIH CC . These visit involve face-to-face genetic counseling medically significant result , follow verification CLIA approve lab . This treatment protocol . Our empiric ability generate medically significant research result limit extensive genetic etiologic heterogeneity . Therefore , participant research diagnostic study . We modify procedure test new probands mutation four HPE gene ( SHH , ZIC2 , SIX3 TGIF ) . As new genetic element confer risk HPE identify , intend add additional test panel . Our lab certify receive test new sample accord CLIA guideline . However , previously collect sample consider suitable diagnostic purpose ; hence , second sample need request case CLIA confirmation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . This research open participant know suspected diagnosis HPE relate brain malformation . Since range severity HPE extensive , accept case compatible wide HPE spectrum finding . All race gender know risk HPE , anywhere world . Nationality place origin specific barrier participation , provide blood tissue sample safely send international FedEx ( bill account ) . 2 . Direct blood relative ( typically parent , occasionally sibling affected individual ) patient HPE also eligible participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . 2 . Medical condition ( ) mental retardation reason exclusion judgement refer physician would involve minimal risk . We anticipate child mental handicap would include research population . We make every effort explain study purpose assent matter family feel age developmentally appropriate child . 3 . We generally review brief clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude case clearly HPE related direct research interest ( e.g . HPE case due Trisomy 13 18 might consider directly relate current research ) . This almost never happen , would attempt make referral appropriate investigator sample send NIH . Although desirable , accept sample suspect diagnosis HPE determination make refer physician independent input HPE team . In circumstance , would likely verify correspondence sample receive request information .</criteria>
