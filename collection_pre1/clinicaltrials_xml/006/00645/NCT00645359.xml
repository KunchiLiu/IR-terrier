	<brief_title>Pilot Study dMRI Tool Early Evaluation Tumor Response Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different type functional imaging investigation tool predict response treatment , image soon start therapy might able good define likelihood response . Functional imaging refers scan measure characteristic size shape ( anatomic imaging ) , measure CT scan . We interested evaluate potential value diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( dMRI ) , setting use early treatment predict patient ' response treatment . Diffusion MRI ( dMRI ) detect change cell structure , potential detect measure cell change occur response treatment . Several group investigate use dMRI monitor treatment response . This strategy frequently explore human patient brain tumor , dMRI demonstrate predict response treatment early starting treatment . A study look response cancer . These study show early change patient later respond treatment , change see within one 2 week . Although diffusion MRI show useful several cancer type , explore evaluation lymphoma . This pilot study evaluate image characteristic Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) dMRI prior treatment 7 day initial chemotherapy order explore whether dMRI useful evaluate response lymphoma chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
