	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , floxuridine gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Hepatic arterial infusion use catheter carry cancer-killing substance directly liver . Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody find tumor cell carry tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Giving hepatic arterial infusion floxuridine together gemcitabine hydrochloride radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose floxuridine give hepatic arterial infusion together gemcitabine hydrochloride radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy see well work treat liver metastases patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) associate toxicity concurrent hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) fluorodeoxypyrimidine ( FUdR ) /Decadron intravenous gemcitabine combine intravenous yttrium-90 ( ^90Y ) chimeric T84.66 ( cT84.66 ) colorectal cancer patient hepatic resection maximum surgical debulking ( &lt; 3 cm ) liver metastasis . II . To study feasibility toxicity adjuvant therapy follow resection and/or ablation liver metastasis . III . To evaluate biodistribution , clearance metabolism ^90Y ^111In ( indium-iii ) chimeric T84.66 administer intravenously . IV . To estimate radiation dos whole body , normal organ , tumor serial nuclear imaging . V. To correlate proteomic profile pre post-therapy toxicity anti-tumor effect . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study floxuridine follow phase II study . Patients receive floxuridine continuous hepatic arterial infusion day 1-14 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 9 11 . Patients also receive yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody cT84.66 IV 25 minute day 9 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive additional course floxuridine combination systemic therapy discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
