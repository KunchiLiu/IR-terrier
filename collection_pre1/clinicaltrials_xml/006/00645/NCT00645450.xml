	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : In first two preliminary study , demonstrate individual chronic PTSD single ( combined 40 mg short- 60 mg long-acting ) 24-hour oral dose propranolol , compare placebo , give immediately follow reactivation PTSD-related memory traumatic event , significantly reduce physiological response script-driven imagery event measure one week later . These result support blockade reconsolidation traumatic memory , process entirely distinct extinction . In addition , find trend post-reactivation propranolol reduce self-reported PTSD symptom , measure via Impact Event Scale-Revised ( IES-R ) . In second preliminary study , perform 6 weekly treatment consist subject describe PTSD-related traumatic event approximately 10 minute follow 0.67 mg/kg ( minimum 40 mg ) short-acting propranolol plus 1 mg/kg ( minimum 60 mg ) long-acting propranolol . The mean Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) Total Score follow six treatment session reduce 44 % ( p=.02 ) . The proposed work examine whether repeat treatment may succeed produce substantive symptomatic improvement . RESEARCH PLAN : The study design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , clinical trial . A crossover design propose effect expect neither short-term reversible . Rather , conclusion formal study period , individual randomize placebo condition offer equal number treatment session propranolol . A placebo control use , rather active treatment control , propose study `` proof concept '' test post-reactivation pharmacological reduction traumatic memory . The control ( active ) treatment structure minimize chance extinction . We recognize eventually new treatment need test establish PTSD treatment , include exposure , clinical utility establish . We regard matter subsequent study present study yield promising result . However , intend compare effect size find propose intervention publish effect size PTSD psychotherapy . METHODOLOGY : Participants include male female combat veteran Afghanistan Iraqi war meet DSM-IV criterion chronic PTSD , recruit locally Manchester VAMC Mental Hygiene Clinic advertising . The presence PTSD assess use CAPS . Participants randomly assign propranolol placebo drug condition . During six memory reactivation session , participant meet psychiatrist , ask participant spend ten minute describe event cause PTSD , reaction . The interviewer facilitate process ask question , keep participant focus traumatic event encourage him/her identify aspect traumatic event continue provoke emotional distress . The traumatic memory reactivation immediately follow administration propranolol placebo . Following six treatment session , script-driven imagery use ass HR , SC , facial EMG response recollection traumatic event PTSD symptom assess use CAPS . A previously develop discriminant function use classify person physiologic `` responder '' `` non-responder . '' There also 6-month follow-up assessment . CLINICAL RELEVANCE : The mechanism memory reconsolidation offer possibility cellular plasticity capitalize reverse neuroanatomical neurophysiological underpinnings traumatic memory . The possibility traumatic memory could significantly weaken intervention simple post-reactivation administration widely use safe medication profound implication treatment PTSD .</brief_summary>
