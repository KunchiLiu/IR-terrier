	<brief_title>Interferon-alpha Treatment Chronic Cough Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) frequently lead chronic cough negatively impact quality life ( QOL ) patient around . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine whether interferon-alpha , deliver low dos via orally dissolve lozenge give 3 time per day 4 week , reduce frequency severity chronic cough patient COPD IPF . Cough frequency assess via 24-hour digital audio recording make prior entry , week 2 4 treatment . Cough severity assess via 100-mm visual analog scale questionnaire complete subject prior entry weekly treatment . Subjects also complete questionnaire regard cough frequency , duration intensity , QOL , dyspnea , antitussive medication usage weekly treatment . All questionnaire repeat weekly 4-week post-treatment observation period ass durability response .</detailed_description>
