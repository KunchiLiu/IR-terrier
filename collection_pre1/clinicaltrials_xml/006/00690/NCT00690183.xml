	<brief_summary>Increased number circulate stem cell physical activity associate improved health old person . This pilot study initial step develop collaborative , translational research project investigate whether physical activity may part exert positive influence age via mobilization stem cell . The specific aim pilot project collect preliminary data explore relationship physical activity stem cell population find blood determine variance number circulate stem cell . We hypothesize stem cell decrease age , person physically active high number stem cell blood . A maximum 40 person recruit participate . Persons eligible participate age 60 older , n't hospitalize recently , immunologic blood disease , infection , undergo chemotherapy . Subjects 2 visit UNMC Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) . The first assessment include evaluation health , physical activity lifestyle via questionnaire . Height , weight abdominal girth measure , blood drawn immune stem cell assessment . Subjects give pedometer accelerometer wear daily 7 day . Subjects return CRC second visit pedometer accelerometer return blood drawn . Stem cell immune assay repeat evaluate variability measure time . The correlation stem cell number physical activity analyze . The data use perform sample size calculation development future study .</brief_summary>
