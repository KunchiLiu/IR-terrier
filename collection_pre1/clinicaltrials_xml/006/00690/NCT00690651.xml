This study aim investigate whether get patient bed within 24 hour surgery accelerate recovery reduce acute hospital length stay without affect wound healing . If bed rest 2 day necessary , benefit patient term general health ability , hospital term cost saving short length stay patient put . The investigator already know early mobilization beneficial follow type orthopedic surgery hip fracture . This study aim investigate early mobilization follow surgical management ankle fracture safe specific regard wound integrity wound outcomes .
