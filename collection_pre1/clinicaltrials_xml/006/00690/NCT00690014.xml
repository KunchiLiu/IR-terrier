	<brief_summary>The process drug elimination occur within kidney complex , involve filtration , secretion absorptive mechanism . Many drug , metabolite toxin , include organic anion cation , rely renal mechanism elimination body . Failure recognize contribution renal mechanism involve drug elimination drug development process result drug interaction toxicity clinical trial . This increasingly important due use OAT1 inhibitor probenecid use adjuvant treatment regimen . Thus , order fully understand effect renal disease , drug nephrotoxin renal transport pathway tubular secretion human , novel approach incorporate vitro ( experimental ) well clinical observation ( clinical trial ) , also call in-vitro/in-vivo correlation ( IVIVC ) need develop . These method use identify evaluate specific kidney `` probe '' drug undergo extensive tubular secretion . Such approach need characterize drug clearance tubular mechanism identify potentially significant drug-drug interaction prior exposure patient Phase 2 3 clinical trial . This investigator-initiated pilot project aim determine pharmacokinetics select FDA-approved compound ( PAH , iothalamate ) use IVIVC model development . The propose research innovative , involve translational approach development IVIVC model apply renal drug clearance . It expectation resultant approach understand pharmacogenomics , inter-subject variability renal drug clearance . This approach generate important new information regard vitro drug-drug interaction light many new potent OAT1 block agent introduce treatment human disease . In future study , hope fully characterize effect diseases diabetes , hypertension , nephropathy renal drug transport mechanism use IVIVC model . We expect result NIH-funded study provide need preliminary data design future pharmacogenomic drug interaction study human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure GFR ( use iothalamate clearance ) renal tubular function ( use PAH clearance ) healthy subject . The protocol approve University Maryland IRB General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) advisory committee ( GAC ) . Following informed consent process , subject evaluate past medical history , undergo physical examination routine laboratory test ( include urinary protein : creatinine ratio ) conduct within 1 month prior study visit . Day 1 : Vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate ) record hourly throughout study visit . Subjects intravenous catheter insert forearm vein arm blood collection intravenous infusion iothalamate PAH . From 30 minute marker administration end evaluation period , subject remain semireclined position except urine collection . A constant-rate infusion initiate 1 mL/min total 3 hour , concentration infusate determine base patient 's estimate renal clearance target plasma concentration 10 mg/L 15 mg/L iothalamate , PAH , respectively . Day 2 : Washout Day 3 : Subject begin take probenecid . Day 4 ( Study visit # 2 ) : Subject admit GCRC 8AM . The final dose probenecid administer . The renal function test conduct describe study visit # 1 . Day 11 : Subject contact monitoring adverse event accord GCRC procedure .</detailed_description>
