	<brief_title>Study Demonstrate Cognitive Enhancing Effects BF2.649</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit person schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder currently experience acute exacerbation psychotic symptom , still display cognitive symptom consequent psychosocial dysfunction . The subject recruit take haloperidol , aripiprazole , risperidone paliperidone . Each study subject spend 4 week fix dose APD stable symptom , time baseline workup complete . At baseline ( Week 0 ) , study subject full symptom evaluation , side effect , neuropsychological battery along full clinical laboratory baseline safety study workup . Next , subject , remain APD , randomize BF2.649 placebo . The dose BF2.649 20 mg/day . Assessment safety parameter ( vital sign , EKGs , clinical lab ) side effect ( adverse event , BAS , SAS ) occur weekly first 4 week ( study week 4 ) every week next 4 week ( study week 8 ) include End Study ( week 12 ) . An EEG take Week 1 Week 8 . Symptomatic outcome measure ( PANSS CGI ) measure every two week double blind phase end study . The neuropsychological battery do first baseline repeat end 8-week double blind phase . After 8 week medication , double-blinded drug stop patient follow period 4 week clinical side effect measure record weekly exception clinical laboratory , record every week . Each study participant see weekly throughout protocol clinical assessment . Finally , person schizophrenia display severe deficit neuropsychological , cognitive , social functioning . Our primary outcome measure determine BF2.649 produce cognitive enhance effect repair neuropsychological deficiency see population . Therefore , blood sample collect study volunteer DNA analysis , serology testing , white cell immortalization baseline phase study ( Week 0 ) . If therapeutic effect see , important able identify genetic characteristic responder BF2.649 .</detailed_description>
