	<brief_summary>Acromegaly chronic disease cause excessive secretion growth hormone ( GH ) mainly due benign tumour localize pituitary gland . The disease develop insidiously , cause gradual progression symptom ; consequently patient diagnose fourth decade life . Administration somatostatin analogue lanreotide show result normalisation decrease GH insulin growth factor ( IGF-1 ) level improvement clinical symptom acromegalic patient . The purpose study evaluate whether lanreotide also effective tumour volume reduction ( tumour shrinkage ) benefit potential tumour shrinkage disease symptoms patient 's quality life .</brief_summary>
