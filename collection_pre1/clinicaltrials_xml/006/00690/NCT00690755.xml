	<detailed_description>We provide clear evidence insulin activation three signal component , Viz. , IRS-1-dependent PI 3-Kinase , atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) PKB/Akt defective diabetic muscle . These defect best see insulin activation conduct half-maximal maximal stimulation . Moreover , whereas previous study show treatment metformin ( Met ) alone improve aPKC activation , treatment thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) alone produce increases activation IRS-1/PI3K aPKC evaluate maximal insulin stimulation , recently find combined treatment Met plus TZD 6 week provokes mark increase insulin effect three signal factor half-maximal maximal insulin stimulation . This work prepared submission publication . We also evaluate improvement insulin signal diabetic muscle 4 hour acute endurance ( one-legged ) exercise find responsiveness aPKC lipid PI3K-derived activator , PIP3 , improve . Also increase activation insulin IRS-2-dependent PI3K , ERK1/2 , downstream protein synthesis machinery , viz. , p70S6 kinase eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2 . These effect exercise would expect enhance glucose transport utilization muscle , promote protein synthesis , i.e. , anabolic response .</detailed_description>
