	<detailed_description>Drug-resistant HIV strain may develop antiretroviral therapy , transmission drug-resistant virus document possible . The emergence drug resistance HIV associate suboptimal virologic response antiretroviral therapy [ 1 ] . The likelihood patient acquire drug-resistant virus relate prevalence drug resistance population specific high-risk behavior . In western country , study suggest prevalence viral resistance least one antiretroviral drug range 6 % 16 % treatment-na√Øve patient , among , 3 % 5 % reduce susceptibility one class [ 2-4 ] . However , data address prevalence drug resistance various population Taiwan currently . Drug resistance measure use either genotypic phenotypic resistance assay . Genotypic assay detect mutation cause dug resistance ; phenotypic assay drug susceptibility assay measure vitro ability virus grow presence serial dilution inhibitor ( , antiretroviral drug ) . Because rapid turnaround time less expensiveness , genotypic assay generally prefer phenotypic assay [ 5 ] . Genotypic resistance assay available three AIDS center Taiwan . However , method use genotypic assay different three center , data gather analyze know epidemiology HIV resistance Taiwan , thus interpretation application result genotypic resistance assay selection antiretrovirals quite questionable Taiwan . Furthermore , though genotypic assay less straightforward , several condition exist cause discordance genotype phenotype , discordance may result difficulty phenotype prediction genotype [ 6 ] . Thus , phenotypic assay may help interpretation resistance test result provide guide decide optimal regimen . With availability newer class antiretrovirals near future , currently commercially available phenotypic test use recombinant virus insertion reverse transcriptase protease gene sequence may enough . A new phenotypic assay measure virus ability grow different concentration NRTIs , NNRTIs , PIs , entry inhibitor , CCR5 inhibitor integrase inhibitor need . It known HIV-1 load plasma strongly correlate disease progression , response antiviral treatment , transmission mother child . The plasma viral RNA representative replicate virus pool time point cell-associated proviral DNA . In order study relationship complete HIV-1 genome phenotypic resistance , choose focus plasma virion . However , patient whose plasma viral load high enough conduct analysis , instead use patient ' proviral DNA infect PBMC phenotypic resistance analysis . Two strategy use amplify viral genome . The first one amplification nearly full-length viral genome . If strategy work , second strategy amplify two fragment viral genome assemble two fragment unique restriction enzyme .</detailed_description>
