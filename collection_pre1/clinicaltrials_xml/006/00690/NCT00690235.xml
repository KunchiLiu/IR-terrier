	<brief_title>Demonstrate Effects Pramlintide Weight Reduction Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study sixteen week placebo-controlled , double-blind investigation effect pramlintide body weight clozapine- olanzapine-induced weight gain . We recruit approximately 72 volunteer plan final N = 25 2 treatment group . ( This number allow normal attrition patient population . If need , recruit 72 volunteer order achieve appropriate number complete subject . ) Patients recruit local Dallas public VA mental health system volunteer study . This study anticipate last 20 week ( 2 week lead-in [ approximately 2-3 visit ] , 1 week training [ 4 visit ] , 16 week active drug/placebo [ one visit per week first 4 week , one visit every 2 week remainder ] , one week follow-up [ one visit ] . Please see attached chart detail visit . ) Volunteers history significant weight gain accompany olanzapine clozapine treatment BMI= &gt; 27 = &lt; 40 . Each volunteer maintain optimal dose clozapine olanzapine randomize blindly pramlintide placebo . Pramlintide administer patient self-injectable form dose begin 180 mcg bid 2 week increase 360 mcg bid remainder study . The randomization pramlintide/placebo precede week-long self-administration training program use placebo pramlintide ( additional information regard nutrition , exercise , general self-care , risk factor diabetes provided patient train program ) . In addition body weight , BMI measure metabolic syndrome collect . Moreover , effect pramlintide cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia assess secondary outcome , well effect psychotic symptom .</detailed_description>
