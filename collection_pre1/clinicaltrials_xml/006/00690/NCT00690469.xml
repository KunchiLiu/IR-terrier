	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate role genotype carcinogen metabolize enzyme ( CME ) DNA repair protein ( DRPs ) father child diagnose retinoblastoma ( RB ) environmental exposure prior child 's conception etiology sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma . II . To test prevalence preconception environmental exposure polymorphisms know predicted functional consequence gene CMEs DRPs different father child sporadic bilateral RB compare father control group . III . To test prevalence father 's preconception environmental exposure polymorphisms CMEs DRPs differs subsets case define type mutation RB1 gene locus . IV . To investigate role genotype CMEs DRPs mother child environmental exposures child 's conception etiology sporadic unilateral RB . V. To test prevalence environmental exposure pregnancy polymorphism know predict functional consequence CMEs different mother child sporadic unilateral RB compare mother control group . VI . To test prevalence polymorphism gene CMEs DRPs know predict functional consequence different child sporadic unilateral RB compare control . VII . To test prevalence gestational exposure polymorphisms gene CMEs mother polymorphism gene CME DRPs child differs subset case define type mutation RB1 gene locus . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants undergo structure telephone interview questionnaire . The parental questionnaire collect basic demographic data ( include age , race , education , income ) , occupational history , medical radiation exposure , diet supplement use ( year pregnancy father , pregnancy mother ) , tobacco use , alcohol use . The mother also ask residential pesticide prior assist reproductive technology . Controls ( parent ) provide saliva sample . If patient also enrol COG-ARET0332 , patient blood tumor sample submit . Parents patient protocol also submit blood sample . Blood sample affect child , blood and/or sputum sample parent may submit . Tumor specimen submit available . For patient , RB1 mutation detection assay DNA derive peripheral blood perform . If mutation find , parent ' DNA also screen . Blood sample undergo DNA-based sequencing analysis , single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping , quantitative Southern blot analysis , isolation RNA reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis , loss heterozygosity analysis .</detailed_description>
