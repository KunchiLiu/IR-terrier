	<detailed_description>Our general hypothesis reduce response muscle protein anabolism insulin play important role loss muscle mass age . Our goal determine mechanism underlie age-related insulin resistance muscle protein , allow u define specific intervention target defect provide scientific basis prevention treatment sarcopenia . Our previous study indicate response muscle proteins anabolic action insulin impair healthy old adult compare young control , hamper anabolic effect mixed feed muscle protein . These change associate age-related reduction vasodilatory response insulin , , data , appear potentially important mediator physiological anabolic effect insulin muscle protein . Preliminary data laboratory also suggest old subject single bout aerobic exercise may restore normal response blood flow , muscle protein synthesis anabolism insulin . Therefore , test healthy subject follow specific hypothesis : 1 . Insulin-induced increase blood flow muscle perfusion necessary physiological stimulation muscle protein synthesis anabolism insulin . 2 . Aging reduces vascular sensitivity insulin , prevent physiological increase blood flow muscle perfusion response insulin , thereby decrease response muscle protein synthesis net balance anabolic action insulin mixed feeding . 3 . Aerobic exercise restore , old subject , insulin-induced increase blood flow muscle perfusion youthful level , thus normalize anabolic effect insulin mix feed muscle protein synthesis net muscle protein balance . We use state-of art stable isotope tracer technique measure muscle protein turnover , newly develop method measure muscle perfusion young old subject . The result study allow u good define physiological mechanism action insulin muscle protein anabolism , advance knowledge pathophysiology sarcopenia , provide scientific basis behavioral and/or pharmacological treatment muscle loss aging .</detailed_description>
