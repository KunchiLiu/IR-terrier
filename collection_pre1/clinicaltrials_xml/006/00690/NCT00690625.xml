	<detailed_description>The prevalence clinically significant temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) -related jaw pain estimate 3 % 5 % . Temporomandibular disorder ( TMDs ) group condition characterize pain dysfunction temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) , articular disc and/or muscle mastication . TMD typically classify three major diagnostic category , use RDC-TMD classification criterion would include Myofacial pain ( without limitation ) , Disc Displacements ( without reduction , include limited opening , ) Arthralgia , Arthritis Arthrosis . These pain problem twice common woman men general population even four time common woman patient population . A wide range treatment modality use management myofacial pain . Physical treatment include ultrasound therapy , appliance therapy , intramuscular nerve root stimulation , anesthetic injection , botulinum toxin injection dry needling trigger point , physical therapy , acupuncture spray stretch . The major goal treatment relieve pain tightness involve muscle . Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil family polyunsaturated fatty acid . Omega-3 fatty acid powerful anti-inflammatory low proinflammatory cytokine . However obtain discernible beneficial effect , large dos Omega-3 fatty acid require . Thus , topically apply alternative prove beneficial systemic route . Studies show anti-inflammatory property Omega-3 fatty acid . This study design evaluate effectiveness topical application omega-3 fatty acid ( 6 % volume ) contain cream person TMD disorder , specifically diagnosis Myofacial Pain . Omega-3 fatty acid minimal side effect apply topically . If Omega-3 fatty acid use study show reduce myofacial pain formulation could potentially use treatment TMD patent myofacial pain future . Omega-3 fatty acid natural ingredient almost side effect . Topical application lead few side effect systemic medication . In addition , substantial morbidity &amp; mortality associate topical application Omega-3 fatty acid . It hypothesize subject receive topical application omega-3 fatty acid demonstrate reduce subjective masseter muscle pain comparison subject receive placebo cream . This pilot study assess topical application Omega-3 fatty acid muscle pain muscle mastication .</detailed_description>
