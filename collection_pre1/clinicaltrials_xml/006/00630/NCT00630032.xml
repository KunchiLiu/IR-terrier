	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether docetaxel effective ixabepilone give surgery combination chemotherapy treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy follow docetaxel ixabepilone compare well work treat patient undergone surgery nonmetastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate benefit sequential administration 3 course combination chemotherapy ( FEC100 ) follow 3 course ixabepilone versus docetaxel 5-year disease-free survival woman nonmetastatic , poor-prognosis breast cancer . Secondary - To compare 5-year distant metastasis-free survival . - To compare 5-year event-free survival . - To compare 5-year overall survival . - To compare safety profile two chemotherapy regimen . - To identify and/or validate predictive-gene expression profile clinical response/resistance two treatment regimen . - To bank frozen fix tumor frozen serum prospectively future translational study genomics proteomics ( transcriptome proteome analysis , tissue array analysis ) . - To compare cost-effectiveness 2 regimen . - To compare quality-of-life patient treat 2 regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , menopausal status ( pre- v post-menopausal ) , tumor hormone-receptor status ( triple-negative v progesterone-receptor negative , HER negative , estrogen-receptor [ ER ] positive ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV , fluorouracil IV , cyclophosphamide IV every 3 week course 1-3 docetaxel IV alone every 3 week course 4-6 . - Arm II : Patients receive treatment course 1-3 arm I ixabepilone IV alone every 3 week course 4-6 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also complete quality life questionnaire periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
