	<brief_title>Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) Phase 2 Homogeneous Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients emphysema currently limit treatment choice . Many patient treat steroid inhaled medication , often provide little benefit . In recent year , lung volume reduction surgery become accept therapy advanced emphysema . Lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) involve removal diseased portion lung order enable remain , healthy portion lung function well . LVRS , although effective many patient , complicate accompany substantial morbidity mortality risk . Aeris Therapeutics develop Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) System intend achieve lung volume reduction without surgery attendant risk . Patients treat use bronchoscope direct treatment damage area lung case homogeneous disease , area less active show extent regional blood flow . The treatment delivers precisely proportion proprietary mixture drug biologics , combine treatment site , form biodegradable hydrogel . The hydrogel act reduce lung volume permanently collapse seal treat area lung . This provide room within chest allow remain portion lung function well . Aeris ' BLVR development program grant Fast Track designation U.S. FDA , subject ongoing clinical trial design investigate safety efficacy BLVR System treatment patient advance heterogeneous ( upper lobe predominant ) emphysema . Fast Track designation reserve drug biologic development program intend treat serious life-threatening condition demonstrate potential address unmet medical need .</detailed_description>
