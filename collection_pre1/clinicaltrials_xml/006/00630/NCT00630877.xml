	<brief_title>Evaluation Flushing ASsessment Tool ( FAST ) Subjects Receiving Niacin Extended-release Plus Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate psychometric characteristic FAST questionnaire . The FAST self-administered questionnaire , complete use hand-held electronic data capture device ( LogPad e-diary ) . Subjects record start stop date time flush event , presence severity individual flushing symptom ( redness , warmth , tingle and/or itch ) , overall assessment flush experience . Evaluation psychometric characteristic FAST base 3 primary data analysis : 1 ) test-retest reliability base intraclass correlation coefficient ; 2 ) construct validity base Spearman correlation coefficient ; 3 ) responsiveness base change FAST score . The mean maximum severity flush event , measure FAST , primary variable evaluate 3 data analysis mention . Psychometric analyse perform blinded treatment group assignment .</detailed_description>
