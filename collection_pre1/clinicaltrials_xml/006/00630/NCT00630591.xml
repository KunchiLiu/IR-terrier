	<brief_summary>Primary Aim : -To explore feasibility acceptability two distinctly different tailor , home-based diet exercise intervention ( one rely partner-assisted , team-based approach emphasize mother-daughter bond one deliver independently ) vs. standardize material ( attention control ) . This aim accomplish assess overall accrual , quantify retention adverse event study arm . The study deem feasible achieves follow criterion : 1 . Accrual 67 mother-daughter dyad intervention accomplish within 1-year period ; 2 . An attrition rate le 20 % achieve ; 3 . The frequency total adverse event significantly high either intervention arm ( compare attention control arm ) , one report serious adverse event directly attributable either intervention . Detailed process data also collect intervention , i.e. , use perceived helpfulness material promote behavior change , frequency quality interaction member mother-daughter dyad , feedback regard intervention material , etc . Secondary Aim : -To explore potential effect ( variation ) note among three intervention arm baseline 6 12- month follow-up follow endpoint : BMI , energy intake nutrient density diet , exercise [ min/week metabolic equivalent ( METs ) ] , self-efficacy adhere energy restrict , plant-based , low saturate fat diet increase exercise , blood pressure , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , social support ( general specifically relate healthful dietary exercise behavior ) , characteristic mother-daughter bond ( e.g. , strength ) .

The exercise test last 8-12 minute . As safety precaution , test study staff also monitor heart rate use 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . This mean study staff place electrode ( sticky pad ) certain location body monitor heart respond exercise . If live within 60 mile clinic , report medical center , study staff send study nurse house ( another location easy reach ) measure height , weight , blood pressure , waist ( use tape measure ) . If blood pressure measurement show blood pressure elevate ( great 179/109 ) , study chair need personal doctor say okay take part study . Activity Monitor Phone Interviews : After first study visit , give activity monitor instruction wear waistband belt ( like pedometer ) , time awake , 7 day row .

All 3 intervention start sooner 6 month mother 's cancer diagnosis , allow time recover treatment . Standardized Materials Group : If assign group , ask exercise improve diet best ability . In order , receive 7 set print material diet , exercise , health information . These material mail every 6-7 week throughout 1-year intervention period . After mail , ask complete short survey ( 16 question ) information receive useful . You ask return survey prepaid , address envelope sent material .

About every 6-7 week throughout 1-year intervention period , also receive 6 personalized newsletter also provide information . After mail , ask complete short survey ( 16-20 question ) information receive useful . You ask return survey prepaid , address envelope sent material . In addition , also give follow equipment supply help exercise eat better : - A pedometer , small device worn like activity monitor count number step take day ; - An Apple Nike + iPod® Sport kit ( include iPod ) play music exercise record time distance exercise ; - Food portion fat information guide help make good food choice ; - Logbooks use record food eat exercise behavior study .
