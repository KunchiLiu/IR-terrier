	<detailed_description>To test hypothesis probiotic decrease risk post pull-through enterocolitis randomize patient receive either probiotic placebo first 3 month surgical treatment HD . E.1 . Design : This study prospectively perform , multi-center , double blind , study drug versus placebo control study . It test hypothesis post-operative administration probiotic HD patient lead reduction occurrence HAEC E.2 . Study medication : VSL # 3 ( VSL Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Ft. Lauderdale , FL ) provide packet , contain 900 billion viable lyophilize bacteria 4 strain Lactobacillus ( L. casei , L. plantarum , L. acidophilus , L. delbrueckii subsp . bulgaricus ) , 3 strain Bifidobacterium ( B. longum , L. breve , B. infantis ) , 1 strain Streptococcus salivarius subsp . thermophilus ( designate hereafter S. thermophilus ) . Maize starch include filler . Placebo provide identical bag contain 3 g maize starch . VSL # 3 placebo administer night . The taste smell active drug readily identifiable . E.2.1 . Formulation study drug : The drug deliver patient 's family individual packet . The family instruct administer probiotic appropriately dilute 2 ounce either express human milk formula . E.2.2 . FDA approval number : VSL # 3 `` medical food '' US need FDA approval . E.2.3 . Medication supplier : VSL Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Ft. Lauderdale , FL E.2.4.Funds medication : It anticipate VSL Pharmaceutical Corporation donate sufficient drug placebo completion study . Additional fund IRB approval cost dispense drug/placebo via Investigational Drug Service request VSL Pharmaceutical Corporation . E.2.5 . Dosing frequency : Dosing base patient weight . For infant great equal 5 kg , one gram ( 360 billion bacteria 4 sachet ) VSL # 3 administer 3 ounce either express breast milk formula daily . For patient 5 kg , 0.5 gm ( 180 billion bacteria 2 sachet ) daily amount formula breast milk . E.2.6 . Time start probiotic : Probiotic vs. placebo begin infant reach full oral feeding . E.2.7 . Duration study : Upon initiation probiotic vs. placebo administration , administration continue 3 month . Follow continue additional 3 month period termination probiotic administration . E.3 . Study population : Study candidate include infant ( newborn 1 year age ) undergo definitive pullthrough Hirschsprung disease . E.3.1 . Study Sites : This study conduct four large pediatric surgery center include : - C.S . Mott Children 's Hospital , Ann Arbor , Michigan , USA - Children 's Hospital Buffalo , Buffalo , New York , USA - Hospital Sick Kids , Toronto , Ontario , Canada - Tanta University , Tanta , Egypt And study include pediatric patient diagnose HD subject definitive pullthrough procedure . Each sit contains quaternary level pediatric surgical care , treat large number patient HD yearly basis . The key advantage Tanta University Hospital group treat three-fold HD patient yearly basis Sites , highly motivated staff research interest HAEC . E.3.2 . Method Patient Recruitment : The study coordinator , co-investigator collaborator site conduct study orientation neonatal staff include staff physician , training-fellows , house officer nurse work unit . These orientation help alert staff potential candidate study . In addition , study coordinator check day new admission neonatal intensive care unit potential candidate . It study coordinator 's responsibility consent parent/guardian write order study . No preference specific sex , race ethnic background give . E.3.3 . Randomization : study double blind study randomization conduct hospital pharmacist responsible dispense medication patient cod special code relate patient ID record keep pharmacist till end study . Physicians caregiver blind receive placebo study drug . Only pharmacist Investigational Drug Service ( similar service ) aware assignment . Each patient receive study number identify patient . The number allow confidentiality simultaneously allow patient identification principal investigator center necessary . E.3.4.Mechanisms drug / placebo distribution : The anticipated number patient enrol study participate center calculate accord previous record center . According number , drug/placebo distribution do . The responsible group blindness study distribution drug pharmacist center he/she keep code patient broken except end study . The pharmacist also responsible dispense drug placebo packet patient monthly supply inform patient guardian bring empty pack receive new medication ensure compliance patient study . E.3.5 . Removal protocol enrollment : Although patient treated intent treat , physician may remove infant protocol number reason : First , parent guardian request study withdrawal , honor . Second , opinion care physician participation study protocol may lead undo harm child . E.3.6 . Guidelines uniformity patient care : As study perform multiple site , series guideline need follow site . Prior initiation study , investigator study monitor meet discus enrollment criterion , case report form ( CRF , see Appendix I ) review protocol performance probiotic administration monitoring infant . The treatment specification list serve outline definitive guideline . Finally , firm agreement definition HAEC establish . E.3.7 . Monitoring : Each site specify study monitor responsible data collection monitoring infant protocol compliance development adverse event ( AEs , see Appendix II ) . The study monitor responsible data transmission data collection analysis . He/she also responsible inform Investigator respective IRBs adverse event . When adverse event believe relation performance study significant adverse event ( SAE ) , responsible reporting within 48 hour IRB , investigator . In similar time , report FDA do . Yearly report AEs IRB FDA do . E.3.8 . Safety Regulatory Issues : Full IRB approval participate institution attain , IRB apprise multi-center design well names participate site . E.3.9 . Data Obtained : E.4.0 . Primary Outcome Measure : The primary outcome measure diagnosis Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis ( HAEC ) . The severity clinical episode HAEC stratify three grade accord establish clinical grading system follow ( 11 ) : Grade I : mild explosive diarrhea , mild moderate abdominal distension , significant systemic manifestation ( fever , anorexia , weight loss , tachycardia ) . Grade II : moderate explosive diarrhea , moderate sever abdominal distension associate mild moderate systemic manifestation . Grade III : explosive diarrhea , mark abdominal distension , shock , impend shock . E.4.1 . Secondary Outcome Measures : Secondary outcome measure measure expression MUC-2 MUC-3 express protein stool study patient . Mucins detect use modified Western immunoblot technique stool specimens previously describe . Finally , attempt correlate additional clinical benefit probiotic HD , examine number un-scheduled clinic visit emergency visit , stool pattern , growth curve probiotic treat group versus placebo group .</detailed_description>
