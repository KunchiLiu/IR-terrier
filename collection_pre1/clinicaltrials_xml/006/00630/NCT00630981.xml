	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1 . Background : Dissociative Disorders frequent , poorly understood under-diagnosed [ Foote et al. , 2006 ; Spiegel , 2006 ] , especially psychiatric emergency unit [ Lazignac et al. , 2005 ] . The management commonly mixed psychotic , depressive anxiety disorder . The treatment dissociative disorder remain controversial . The psychotherapeutic guideline propose International Society Study Dissociative Disorders ( ISSD ) recently adapt French speak user [ Damsa et al. , 2005 ] . There consensus antipsychotic antidepressant would preferable patient suffer dissociative disorder , accompany depressive psychotic symptom . We good clinical experience quetiapine escitalopram specific group patient . 2 . Rationale study ; Clinical [ Lazignac et al. , 2005 ] neurobiological [ Kelley-Puskas et al. , 2005 ] review dissociative disorder emphasize value first open label study effect specific combine psychotherapy pharmacotherapy patient dissociative disorder [ Damsa et al. , 2006 ] . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 1 . Primary objective - The efficacy specific combine psychotherapy pharmacotherapy patient dissociative disorder , term favorable outcome ( DES scale ) . 2 . Secondary objective - The efficacy specific combine psychotherapy pharmacotherapy patient dissociative disorder , term DES CGI-I scale value . - The effect combine treatment depressive feature [ Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale item suicide ( MADRS ) ] . - The occurrence possible extra-pyramidal side effect ( Barnes Akathisia Simpson Angus Rating Scales ) . - The therapeutic alliance clinical outcome ( Helping Alliance Questionnaire Luborsky ) , [ Luborsky , 1976 ; Luborsky et al. , 1996 ] . - The relationship serum lipid level depressive symptom . - Tolerability adverse effect quetiapine . 3 . STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 1 . Study design . Open single arm 'pilot ' clinical trial patient dissociative disorder , admit psychiatric emergency unit Geneva ( general capacity : 20-30 patients/day ) . Patients interview accord Dissociative Experiences Scale ( DES ) , score 30 high , Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders ( SCID ) administer . When outcome SCID positive , patient include study . The Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale ( CGI-I ) , HDRS MADRS item suicide administer entry 3 8 week . The patient treated psychiatrist experience use specific combine treatment dissociative disorder [ Damsa et al. , 2005 ] . The psychiatrist decide antidepressant/antipsychotic medication . In unit first choice indication quetiapine ( 400 mg/d ) antipsychotic treatment , escitalopram ( 10 mg/d ) antidepressant . The quetiapine schedule 50-100-200-300-400-600 mg/d ( min . 300 mg ) , 300-600 mg/d . Therapeutic alliance assess , patient therapist ( Luborsky scale ) end first interview , 3 8 week . Serum lipids level measure blood sample [ Agargun et al. , 2004 ] . 2 . Selection study population - Inclusion criterion : write informed consent , DES-score great 30 DSM-IV criterion dissociative disorder ( SCID ) , 18-65 year , able comply study requirement , good physical health ( medical history physical examination ) . Female patient childbearing potential must negative urinary pregnancy test . - Exclusion criterion : pregnancy/lactation , suicidal behavior require hospitalization borderline personality disorder , substance dependence , psychotropic cholesterol-lowering medication , intolerance lack response study medication , unstable inadequately treat medical illness ( angina pectoris , hypertension , congestive heart failure ) , involvement plan conduct study , participation present study another drug trial within 4 week prior enrolment study long accordance local requirement , cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor inducer , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) equal less 1.5 x 109/L , unstable Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) opposition physician responsible patient 's DM . 3 . Discontinuation subject participation - Criteria : subject free withdrawal time , safety reason , severe non-compliance protocol , subject lose follow-up , development discover exclusion criterion , neutrophil count le 1.0 x 109/L [ Adverse Event ( AE ) specially assess ] . - Procedures : subject discontinue ask reason discontinuation . If possible , assessed investigator . The investigational medication return subject . 4 . Treatments - Identity investigational product - Doses treatment regimen quetiapine use , patient need antipsychotic . Escitalopram ( 10 mg/day ) use , patient need antidepressant . Labeling medication local language complies local regulatory requirement . The administration investigational medication must record appropriately . 4 . OUTCOME VARIABLES 1 . Primary Variable : Proportion patient experience 20 % DES score reduction 8 week . 2 . Secondary Variables : - Change DES score 3 8 week . - Dichotomized DES score ( le 25 equal great 25 ) - CGI-I score 3 8 week - Barnes Akathisia Simpson-Angus Rating Scales , Helping Alliance Questionnaire Luborsky , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale item suicide ( baseline 3 8 week ) - Cortisol Lipids - Adverse Events 3 . Derived Efficacy Variables : - Favorable outcome ( least 20 % reduction DES score ) . - Partial remission ( least 15 % reduction CGI score ) . 4 . Safety measurement variable : Cardiac frequency blood pressure . 5 . DATA MANAGEMENT . The data confidentially treat kept locked room . 6 . STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 1 . Description analysis population : - The safety population consist patient take least one quetiapine dose . - The intention-to-treat ( ITT ) population consist patient take least one quetiapine dose least one baseline assessment one post-baseline DES assessment . - The Per-Protocol ( PP ) population subset ITT population , consist patient major protocol violation deviation . - Each patient represent one observation . 2 . Statistical analysis : - The primary variable : proportion patient experience least 20 % DES score reduction 8 week 95 % confidence interval . - change DES score , SAS , BARS , HAM-D Luborsky scale CGI-I analyzed model analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . - Changes MADRS suicidal item score illustrate descriptive statistic . - The relationship therapeutic alliance clinical outcome serum lipid level suicidal behavior analyze repeat measure ANOVA . - The DES score dichotomize less 25 equal great 25 presented frequency table visit . - Changes physical examination value laboratory value show shift table . - Adverse event summarize show frequency table . 3 . Determination sample size : As single-arm , open label pilot study , formal sample size calculation perform . In expect sample size 30 patient , proportion patient achieve 20 % reduction DES score , confidence interval estimate -18 +18 % ; drop-out patient replace . 7 . ETHICS The study protocol , include Informed Consent Form , approve local IRB Ethical committee Swiss Medic Authority . The principal investigator responsible inform IRB IEC amendment protocol accordance local requirement . The study perform accordance ethical principle Declaration Helsinki consistent ICH/Good Clinical Practice , local regulatory requirement . Informed consent : The principal investigator centre ensure subject give full adequate oral write information nature , purpose , possible risk benefit study . Subjects must also notify free discontinue study time . The subject give opportunity ask question allow time consider information provide . No study specific procedure investigation perform subject sign date informed consent . The principal investigator ( ) store original , sign Informed Consent Form . A copy sign Informed Consent Form give subject . 8 . QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The study monitor designate monitor investigator permit trial related audit , IRB/IEC review regulatory inspection ( ) . The investigator provide direct access source data/documents quality control activity . 9 . PUBLICATION POLICY Two month study completion , abstract congress presentation available . Four month study completion , first draft manuscript available . 10. FINANCING AND INSURANCE Partial finance AstraZeneca Insurance : ZÃ¼rich Versicherung 11 . PROCEDURES IN CASE OF EMERGENCY , OVERDOSE OR PREGNANCY Procedures case medical emergency : The principal investigator responsible ensuring procedure expertise available handle medical emergency study . A medical emergency usually constitute SAE report , see Section 4 .</detailed_description>
