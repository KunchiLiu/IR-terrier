	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety give external beam radiation , follow Cyberknife radiosurgery boost different dose level , together chemotherapy drug call capecitabine . The dose Cyberknife radiosurgery boost make high slowly protocol . Patients hilar cholangiocarcinoma ( Klatskin tumor ) , amenable surgical removal , eligible . The hypothesis highly focused high dose radiation deliver use Cyberknife conjunction traditional radiation chemotherapy improve outcome patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This dose escalation study escalate dose Cyberknife radiosurgery boost external beam radiation 45 Gy concurrent capecitabine . The three dose level 4 Gy x5 , 5 Gy x5 6 Gy x 5 , 3 patient dose level . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define acute grade 3 liver intestinal toxicity acute grade 4 toxicity . If one patient experience DLT particular dose level , cohort expand 6 patient . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) define dose level result DLT 2 6 patient cohort . At least 5 patient enrol cohort 6 Gy x 5 even none first 3 experienced DLT , mean added verification dose tolerance , upper limit dose study . The patient population include patient unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma without prior history radiation . We anticipate accrue 1 patient every 2 month ; therefore , estimate require approximately 22 month accrue 11 patient DLT experience patient require expansion cohort .</detailed_description>
