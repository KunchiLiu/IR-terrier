	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation Of The Mitroflow Aortic Pericardial Heart Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bioprosthetic heart valve offer several advantage mechanical valve , important freedom need anticoagulation low rate thromboembolic event . Pericardial bioprosthetic valve know hemodynamic performance superior porcine valve , excellent hemodynamic performance pericardial valve particularly relevant patient small aortic root . However , long-term durability continue main concern use pericardial valve . Although first generation pericardial valve withdraw market due poor durability , research indicate structural failure early pericardial valve due tissue preparation technique design failure rather pericardial tissue.The unique desing Mitroflow Aortic Heart Valve may provide superior hemodynamic performance tissue valve .</detailed_description>
