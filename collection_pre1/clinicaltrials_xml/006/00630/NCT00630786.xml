	<detailed_description>This exploratory phase 1b/2 , global , multicenter , single-arm , 2-part ( phase 1b 2 ) study conatumumab combination panitumumab patient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer . The objective Part 1 identify tolerable dose conatumumab combination panitumumab base incidence dose-limiting toxicity patient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer . The objective Part 2 evaluate objective response rate stratify Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene ( KRAS ) status ( wild-type versus mutant ) patient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer treat combination panitumumab conatumumab ( tolerable dose identify part 1 ) .</detailed_description>
