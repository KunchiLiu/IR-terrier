	<detailed_description>Context : Expert recommendation CPR skill ( blow air lung , press chest ) poorly follow health care provider . CPR sensor small hockey `` puck '' place chest CPR delivery able coach rescuer perform well CPR corrective voice feedback . More adult survive quality CPR ( Q-CPR ) improve . This new technology currently approve use child , specifically 6 month &lt; 8 year age . Objectives : 1 . Characterize trained pediatric health care provider opinion concern appropriate current Q-CPR sensor ( `` puck '' ) , FDA approve child â‰¥ 8 year age , use young child age 6m &lt; 8 year age . 2 . Determine need Q-CPR sensor ( `` puck '' ) size change improve suitability young child &lt; 8 year age , base upon trained pediatric health care provider opinion . 3 . Characterize amount Q-CPR sensor ( `` puck '' ) overlap standard large small mock defibrillator electrode pad place usual location chest . 4 . Evaluate train pediatric health care provider self-reported willingness use current modify Q-CPR sensor ( `` puck '' ) young child , 6 month &lt; 8 year age . Study Design/Setting/Participants : This observational study perform Emergency Department ( ED ) , Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) , Operating Room ( OR ) regular inpatient care area ( RIPCA ) settings Children 's Hospital Philadelphia . Parents guardians child age 6m &lt; 8 year age receive routine clinical care patient care area approach inclusion . Health care practitioner ( HCPs ) ED , OR PICU also approach inclusion . Study Measures : Children age , length , weight , simple measurement chest , neck abdomen take . The difference train pediatric health care provider placement compression sensor assessment suitability / willingness use current size modify sensor assess .</detailed_description>
