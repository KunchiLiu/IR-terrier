	<detailed_description>Studies show may inverse relationship infection worm include hookworm inflammatory disease include multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . This explain protective immune reaction trigger hookworm body dampen inflammation . In mice MS , infection mouse worm reduce inflammation damage brain . The primary purpose study determine whether people MS expose small number hookworm develop protective immune reaction may reduce MS disease activity . We also plan determine effect hookworms relapse 1 year study . A study people MS naturally infect intestinal parasite show significant protection 5 year , level biological marker infection immune substance trigger similar one obtain controlled infection normal volunteer , allergic asthmatic people . We think study genuine potential benefit people MS , know interest MS patient community . At therapeutic dos propose , innocuous infection . Natural hookworm infection affect 1 billion people worldwide , often without symptom unless parasite load high . Our controlled exposure study show good tolerability safety ; risk infect others auto-infection virtually nil Western standard hygiene condition . Many people MS ask state would prefer innocuous infection microscopic larvae man-made product may side effect . If protective mechanism determine study may also lead new way treat MS , possibly select specific chemical component worm immune response confer protection . The increase MS Western world , along autoimmune inflammatory disease asthma may attribute decreased exposure infection gut parasite due improve hygiene ( 'the hygiene hypothesis ' ) . In animal model , control parasite infection include hookworm related worm protect MS-like disease . Parasites evolved host-specific molecular mechanism dampen condition excessive immune response thus survive . These parasite induce regulatory mechanism include Treg novel class B cell also dampen immune response call Breg recently show improve MS natural infection . They may suppress class lymphocytes cause damage MS , Th17 cell . We produce , control exposure , similar response associate protective natural exposure MS. We unique combination expertise hookworm biology , control parasite exposure immunology MS MS trial data human study indicate safe tolerable intervention significant potential .</detailed_description>
