	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate patient Acorn CorCapTM Cardiac Support Device ( CSD ) place around heart treatment heart failure time mitral valve surgery . The CorCapTM CSD intend support heart , potentially prevent dilation associate progressive heart failure , thereby potentially preserve improve heart function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Confirmation Trial Acorn CorCap Cardiac Support Device ( CSD ) Same Time Mitral Valve Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Acorn CorCap Cardiac Support Device ( CSD ) new therapy treatment heart failure design reduce leave ventricular dilation , one important pathophysiological mechanism underlie clinical syndrome heart failure . The Acorn CorCap CSD intend reduce wall stress support heart , order prevent dilation associate progressive heart failure . It design result reduce leave ventricular size improve leave ventricluar function , result improve patient functional status . The purpose study provide confirmatory data demonstrate improve benefit-risk profile support Pre-Market Approval ( PMA ) application Acorn CorCap CSD place concomitant Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement ( MVR ) . The primary efficacy objective evaluate patient functional status 6 month follow-up . The safety endpoint perioperative ( 30 day ) mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Dilated cardiomyopathy either ischemic nonischemic origin Patients must stable , optimally uptitrated medical therapy recommend accord current guideline standard care heart failure therapy United States . This minimally include : 1 . Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor ( ACE ) alternate ACE tolerate great equal 1 month prior enrollment ( required patient mitral valve anomaly likely respond medication require surgical intervention ) . 2 . Treatment betablocker , unless intolerant , great equal 3 month prior enrollment ( required patient mitral valve anomaly likely respond medication require surgical intervention ) . 3 . Diuretic least `` prn '' ( occasion require ) . 4 . Cardiac medication unchanged great equal 1 month except diuretic adjustment ( required patient mitral valve anomaly likely respond medication require surgical intervention ) . Adult ( 18 80 year ) . Indexed leave ventricular end diastolic dimension ( LVEDDi ) 30 mm/m2 40 mm/m2 determine transthoracic echocardiography . Mitral regurgitation ( MR ) great equal 2+ schedule mitral valve repair replacement . Concomitant tricuspid valve repair replacement ( TVR ) and/or atrial fibrillation ablation procedure permit . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less equal 45 percent via transthoracic echocardiography , cardiac catheterization , radionuclide scan , magnetic resonance image New York Heart Association Functional Class ( NYHA ) II , III IV Geographically available followup Signed Informed Consent Inability reach maximal effort CPX test define CPX Core Lab Planned cardiac surgical procedure MVR Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . Significant cardiomegaly , estimate exceed large available size CorCap CSD . Expectation exist cardiothoracic adhesion would cause inability gain complete circumferential access heart . Existing patent CABG . Candidates surgical revascularization determine angiogram . Patients ischemic heart disease angiogram within past 3 year lesions amenable revascularization exclude repeat angiogram . Any condition consider contraindication extracorporeal circulation . Use Intra aortic Balloon Pump ( IABP ) , intravenous inotropic vasoactive agent within 30 day prior enrollment . Preoperative hemodynamic optimization IABP , IV inotropes vasoactive agent may permit scheduled occur within 48 hour plan index surgery . Current anticipate need leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) cardiac replacement device . Anticipated need heart transplant within next two year . Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , unstable angina , cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) within past 3 month . Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) transmyocardial laser revascularization ( TMR PMR ) within past 3 month . Presence arrhythmias cause hemodynamic instability , history resuscitate sudden death without subsequent treatment implantable defibrillator amiodarone , atrial fibrillation ventricular rate great 100 bpm medication . Comorbid condition reduces life expectancy le 1 year . Active infection . Pregnancy time enrollment . ( Women child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test within two week prior enrollment , use hormonal contraceptive intrauterine device . ) Enrolled another investigational study would confound interpretation trial result . Patients participate control patient previous CorCap PMA randomize trial . Unable comply protocolrequired followup ( judged primary investigator refer cardiologist ) . Late stage heart failure increase surgical risk define presence four following : 1 . LVEDD great 80 mm/m2 2 . Resting systolic blood pressure ( BP ) less equal 80 mm Hg ( clinical exam ) 3 . Atrial fibrillation time enrollment pace rhythm underlying atrial fibrillation 4 . Heart failure great equal 8 year 5 . 6 minute walk less equal 350 meter ( 1148 foot ) 6 .
