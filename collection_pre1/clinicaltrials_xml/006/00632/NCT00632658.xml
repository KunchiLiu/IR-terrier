	<brief_summary>Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( cGVHD ) important cause morbidity mortality patient undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . cGVHD usually occur 100 day follow transplantation develop 20-60 % transplant recipient . The incidence cGVHD varies depend age marrow recipient , use sibling unrealted donor bone marrow , teh use unmanipulated T cell-depleted bone marrow , perhaps factor . Clinically , cGVHD characterize multi-system disease , frequently mimic clinical feature autoimmune disease . The manifestation include skin change ( lichenoid sclerodermatous change , change pigmentation , loss accessory structure hair , dystrophic nail , rash ) , joint contracture , severe cramping , hepatic dysfunction , sicca syndrome , obstructive lung disease , esophageal dysmotility , weight loss , polyserositis , immunodeficiency , autoantibody include anti-nuclear antibody , anti-erythrocyte antibody , anti-platelet antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Symptom Scale Children With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number child cGVHD deal many year disfigure painful chronic illness side effect long term steroid use . The number stem cell transplant do child grow give transplant patient variety nonmalignant disorder give use alternative donor source . The broad category limit extensive cGVHD recognize clinicans , particularly useful clinical practice . Since cGVHD may involve almost every organ system adn since cGVHD constitutes wax waning nature , cGVHD make clinical management difficult complicate . Currently , symptom scale use adult population measure symptom burden adult cGVHD . This scale call `` Lee Symptoms Scale '' . The purpose project develop scale similar design Lee Scale , specifically design measure burden cGVHD pediatric population</detailed_description>
