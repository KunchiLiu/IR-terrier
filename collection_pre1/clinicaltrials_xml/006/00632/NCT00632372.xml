	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect analyze electrical measurement , timing , signal CRT-D device heart failure patient either already implanted leave atrial pressure sensor undergo simultaneous implantation leave atrial pressure sensor CRT-D device . These device may place time separately ( staged procedure ) discretion investigator . A comparison make information gather CRT-D system information gather leave atrial pressure sensor .</brief_summary>
