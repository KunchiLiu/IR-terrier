	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Biofeedback Standard Therapy Men Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy Transurethral Resection Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To establish whether conservative physical treatment deliver personally trained health professional result well urinary outcome compare standard management men incontinence prostate surgery . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type operation ( radical prostatectomy vs transurethral resection prostate ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( intervention group ) : At 6 week surgery , patient undergo assessment symptom physiotherapist continence nurse . All patient teach pelvic floor muscle train men urgency urge incontinence also teach bladder training . Pelvic floor training consist 3 maximum pelvic floor contraction 3 position ( stand , sit , lie ) twice day , lift pelvic floor walking , tighten pelvic muscle activity , tighten pelvic muscle urinate squeeze last drop . The strength pelvic floor contraction monitor biofeedback involve digital anal assessment relay information back men order know perform contraction correctly inform increase strength duration contraction . Therapists may use machine-mediated biofeedback anal biofeedback probe discretion addition digital anal assessment . Bladder training consist gradually delay urination pelvic floor muscle contraction distract activity teach bladder hold increase volume urine . Patients also receive customized Pelvic Floor Exercise Booklet describe pelvic floor muscle train addition customize Lifestyle Advice Booklet give general lifestyle advice . Patients reinforcement session approximately 2 , 6 , 12 week first appointment . - Arm II ( control group ) : Patients receive customize Lifestyle Advice Booklet contain supportive lifestyle advice ( without reference pelvic floor muscle training ) mail follow randomization .

A Health Care Utilization Questionnaire obtain 3 9 month . Additional questionnaire obtain baseline 6 12 month . The use NHS service , pad , practice pelvic floor muscle training document group use information questionnaire Urinary Diaries . Six month last patient recruit , check Scottish men perform compare self-reported operation , diagnosis , hospital admission centrally collect data validate proportion data .
