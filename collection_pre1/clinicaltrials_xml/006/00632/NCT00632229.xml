	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) common , chronic , oftentimes disable disorder . The establish first-line treatment OCD specific form Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SRIs ) . Few patient OCD experience complete symptom resolution either modality . Even two consecutive adequate SRI trial , many 30 % -40 % patient fail derive satisfactory response . Pharmacological option SRI-resistant case include switch different antidepressant , increase dose SRI , augmentation another agent . Among pharmacological augmentation strategy , adjunctive antipsychotic medication enjoy empirical support well wide-scale use clinical practice . Utilizing IMS Health 's National Disease Therapeutic Index ( NDTI ) 12 month end November 2004 , 4.2 % antipsychotic medication use anxiety 1.3 % specifically OCD . Conversely , OCD patient , antipsychotic medication account 8.6 % drug use ( IMS Health NDTI MAT , 2004 ) . Among pediatric patient , prescription antipsychotic increase 8.6 1,000 U.S. child 1995-1996 39.4 1,000 child 2001-2002 ( Cooper et al. , 2006 ) . Similarly , Medco , private insurance company , note rate child 19 year covered private insurance least one atypical prescription jump 80 % 2001 2005 — 3.6 per 1,000 6.5 per 1,000 ( USA Today , extract 5/2/2006 ) . These rate parallel research , approximately 35 % adult patient psychotropics take antipsychotic addition SRI . Thus , clearly large sample OCD patient prescribe atypical antipsychotic augment treatment . Previous study show approximately 33-50 % OCD patient adequate response SRI medication positive response atypical antipsychotic medication add ( Bloch et al. , 2006 ) . Risperidone study agent consistently positive finding ( e.g. , McDougle et al. , 2000 ) . However , problematic acute long-term side effect risperidone ( atypicals ) concern , time , limit use . Paliperidone , metabolite risperidone utilizes OROS osmotic drug-release technology , number advantage risperidone include lack drug x drug interaction predictable pharmacokinetic profile associate well tolerability . Thus , paliperidone potential safer alternative augmentation OCD patient pending support efficacy data . Given need examine efficacy paliperidone , protocol design determine whether paliperidone augmentation SRI effective relative placebo-control , safe/tolerable patient OCD adequately respond past adequate SRI treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Meets DSMIVTR criterion principal current diagnosis OCD confirm clinical evaluation structure interview . OCD subject comorbidities include provided OCD judge chief complaint . 2 . Subjects must continue experience clinically significant symptom OCD ( YBOCS score ≥19 rating `` moderate '' great Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) scale ) despite least two adequate SRI monotherapy trial . One unsatisfactory trial include SRI currently take patient provide duration treatment 12 week dose adequate . Subjects must take clinically effective dose SRI ( i.e. , clomipramine , citalopram , escitalopram , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , paroxetine sertraline ) least 12 week . Subjects must current dose least 12 week must maintain current dose throughout study . 3 . Between age 1870 year age . 4 . Only subject OC symptom least oneyear duration include . 5 . Eligible subject must good physical health . Screening procedure include detailed medical history , complete physical neurological exam , routine blood study ( CBC , liver function test , electrolyte ) , ECG , urine toxicology screen , serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . 1 . Primary depression , schizophrenia psychotic disorder . 2 . Active bipolar disorder . 3 . Nonresponder past atypical antipsychotic augmentation . This criterion choose prevent recruit sample chronically refractory OCD case would otherwise suit extreme intervention deep brain stimulation . 4 .
