	<brief_summary>Prostate Cancer patient treat LHRH agonist ( e.g. , goserelin ) lose Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) . Using prospective , observational study design , propose monitoring physician manage Cancer Treatment Induced Bone Loss ( CTIBL ) patient . The gold standard evaluate BMD dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) . The propose study provide first prospective data rate Skeletal Related Events ( SREs ) prostate cancer patient undergo ADT help develop official guideline use DEXA screen prostate cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Health Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A consequence ADT gradual bone loss , so-called cancer treatment induce bone loss ( CTIBL ) . The current standard care addition Vitamin D Calcium upon initiation ADT . Moreover , bisphosphonates consider treat prevent CTIBL . However , bisphosphonates costly , thus desire identify target specific subset patient would benefit treatment . By obtain baseline BMD monitoring Skeletal Related Events ( SREs ) , hope identify specific sub-set patient would benefit treatment . Using prospective , observational study design , propose monitoring physician manage CTIBL patient .</detailed_description>
