	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radical prostatectomy surgery remove entire prostate . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Sometimes tumor may need treatment progress . In case , active surveillance may sufficient . It yet know treatment regimen effective localized prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study active surveillance see well work compare radical prostatectomy radiation therapy treat patient localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess survival patient localized prostate cancer 10 year 15 year treatment . - To investigate 5-year survival , disease progression ( i.e. , biochemical clinical ) , treatment complication , low urinary tract symptom patient . - To investigate psychosocial impact case-finding treatment patient , include generic health status , quality life , sexual function . - To estimate resource use cost case-finding , treatment , follow-up . - To compare cost outcomes treatment term survival health-related quality life . - To collect sample suitable basic science research ( ProMPT study ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratified age ( 50-55 v 56-59 vs 60-65 vs 66-69 year ) , Gleason score ( 2-4 v 5-7 vs 8-10 ) , average result Prostate Check Clinic first biopsy prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test ( &lt; 6 vs 6-9.9 v ≥ 10 ng/mL ) . Patients either randomize select 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I ( active monitoring ) : Patients undergo active monitoring disease . Patients see research nurse 3 month randomization fine disease management plan . As part process , patient , together urologist research nurse , develop management plan include repeat PSA testing ( every 3 month first year every 6 month thereafter ) detect biochemical progression . Patients also undergo annual review appointment opportunity digital rectal examination , indicate ( e.g. , rise PSA new symptom ) . PSA level monitor test repeat need . Additional review appointment arrange study urologist confirm rise PSA level , apparent symptom spread disease , concern PSA level . At review appointment , study urologist discus issue raise current option , include remain active monitoring , undergo re-staging cancer , receive treatment , appropriate . - Arm II ( radical prostatectomy ) : Patients undergo radical prostatectomy ( RP ) within 2-12 week study entry . Patients undergo RP pelvic lymphadenectomy without frozen section biopsy pelvic lymph node prior prostatectomy . Patients positive surgical margin may recommend adjuvant treatment surgeon 's discretion . - Arm III ( radical conformal radiotherapy ) : Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 7.4 week ( 37 fraction ) . Patients receive neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy comprise luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonists every 4 week , begin prior start radiotherapy continue least 3-6 month ( least completion radiotherapy ) . Patients also receive cyproterone acetate equivalent alternative begin 1 week prior first LHRH agonist injection continue least 3 week . After completion surgery radiotherapy , patient follow accord National Health Service ( UK ) guideline every 6-12 month . All patient complete questionnaire baseline periodically study provide socio-demographic information ( e.g. , age , socio-economic status , ethnicity ) , well clinical information past current urinary symptom , previous PSA test , anxiety depression , sexual function , general health status , treatment-related quality life , environmental exposure . Resource use cost-utility analysis also perform .</detailed_description>
