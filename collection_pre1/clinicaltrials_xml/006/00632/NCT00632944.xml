	<detailed_description>Falls among hospital patient persistent problem , 2.3 7 fall occur U.S. hospital every 1000 patient day . Approximately 30-48 % percent fall result injury 5 10 percent result serious injury . Fall related death occur rate 46.2 per 100,000 2003 . Hospital fall affect young old patient many occur patient alone involved elimination-related activity . Falls result injury may lead extended hospitalization increase cost . Patients fall sustain injury report hospital charge $ 4,200 high per admission patient fall . Hourly nursing round show decrease fall 52 % . Hospitalized patient often require assistance basic self-care task , use toilet , ambulate , eat ; ask assistance use call light . Therefore , patient 's level satisfaction nursing care depend principally upon patient 's perception well nursing staff able meet need . The call light lifeline hospitalize patient , also impose considerable demand nurse ' time . Several study document unfavorable effect patient ' frequent use call light effectiveness patient-care management inpatient unit , may already compromise staff shortage . Current data Crouse Hospital show fall rate 4S 5.05 per 1000 patient day , demonstrate significant opportunity improvement . Data 6S show fall rate 5.26 per 1000 patient day . As far patient satisfaction , percentage patient give 4S 9 10 possible score 10 overall rating care 56.29 % . Likewise number patient would definitely recommend Crouse Hospital others 56.25 % . Both satisfaction question ( Core IP Key Results : I would prefer return X without hesitation , care need I would recommend X without hesitation others ) show significant opportunity improvement . Preliminary call light usage gather Hill Rom call light system , currently available 6S , show 6,909 individual us call light within 4-week period . One surmise number patient issue address timely manner therefore significant opportunity improvement exist . Only aggregate data collect . No subject identify directly identifier . The objective study : 1 . Correlate effect hourly nurse round , , patient fall call light use . 2 . Determine change patient satisfaction level All subject 18 year admit 4 South Irving ( Oncology/OBGYN ) 6 South Irving ( Orthopedic/Neurology ) twelve month study include research subject . Exclusion Criteria : Any patient admit 4 South Irving 6 South Irving Crouse Hospital exclude study . Patients age 18 year admit unit . Sample size study determine call light usage rate , patient satisfaction score , fall rate . Current process average sample size calculation obtain follow : 1 ) fall rate exist fall rate report 2 ) patient satisfaction Avatar survey , 3 ) call bell usage preliminary Hill Rom system data . For sample size calculation , α=0.05 β=0.10 use . Based calculation , study baseline data patient satisfaction calculate use Avatar patient satisfaction data six-month period prior study initiation . The baseline data fall collect exist fall rate report use six month data prior study initiation . Data variable continue collect 6 month implementation nursing round . For call bell usage rate data 2 week prior round implementation collect baseline data . Data collect 4 week follow implementation nurse round . Data average patient age , length stay , severity illness unit obtain Transition Systems , Inc. TSI , financial data base type Decision Support System . In order get information patient 's age query make TSI . It print average age particular unit within specified time . Measures central tendency spread calculate variable compare unit . Chi-square test , rank sum test , test mean use compare baseline post-intervention demographic characteristic reason call light usage unit . Rate ratio compare post- pre-intervention fall rate call rate calculate . For fall rate call rate , significance test conduct determine whether rate ratio differ two unit . The change proportion patient indicate satisfied care unit intervention also calculate compare . The data analyze use SAS®9 . No data involve individual patient identifier present analysis . Findings study potentially use change nursing practice Crouse Hospital . 4-South Irving , experimental unit , use control . A second unit , 6S , maintain current practice data unit use determine hospital-wide fluctuation fall rate , patient satisfaction , call light usage . Age , gender , severity illness subject control experimental unit compare . Because patient population differ experimental control unit , reason patient use call light collect verify two group use call light similar reason . The principal co-investigators study educate nursing personnel unit collect document call light data 1 week prior start data collection process . Baseline call light data reason patient use call light number patient call collect 2 week . After baseline call light data collect principal co-investigators educate nursing personnel 4 South Irving round patient . Education last 2 week include question ask patient room , task need do time room , round patient , document round . An hourly rounding toolkit purchase author original study , include educational video , use assist education phase . Nursing leadership , include nurse manager , Director Medical-Surgical Nursing , Chief Nursing Officer Clinical Nurse Specialists , educate technique ensure round consistently complete nursing personnel . The implementation nursing round begin two week round education complete . One member nursing staff , include RNs , LPNs , Nursing Assistants , require perform nursing round every hour 4 South Irving Patients awaken sleep unless necessary treatment . During nurse round , nursing personnel assess pain level use pain-assessment scale , offer toileting assistance , assess patient 's position position comfort , make sure call light within patient reach , put television remote control bed light switch within patient reach , put bedside table next bed , put tissue box water within patient 's reach prior leave room ask `` Is anything I I leave ? I time I room . '' Nursing personnel also tell patient member nursing staff ( name write white board room ) back hour round . Nursing staff member expect complete patient-care task , unless authorize dispense medication work IVs . Laminated pocket card give nursing staff continually remind action perform round . Patients awaken check pain , positioning , need use bathroom ; however environmental check complete round . Members nurse leadership team include nurse manager , Director Medical-Surgical Nursing , Chief Nursing Officer , Clinical Nurse Specialists make frequent observation staff , use round documentation sheet patient interview , verify round occur expect . Call light usage collect use Hill Rom call light system . Recently , Hill Rom Beds add 4 South . Now two unit equip Hill Rom Beds correspond Hill Rom call light . All call light place individual patient room record central server locate nursing station . The central server generate print report call light use user specified time frame . Reports include time call light place , area place call light response time . Reasons call light usage document bedside nursing personnel standard sheet . The documentation form collect every day 7a.m . principal investigator co-investigators study . New documentation form post daily 7a.m . Inter-rater reliability perform compare manual call light data computerize call light data collect within Hill Rom call light system . Documentation round time frequency also document nursing personnel standard form . This form collect every day 7a.m . either principal investigator co-investigator study . New round documentation form post daily . Rounding documentation form use calculate percentage round complete expect . On unit , baseline data collection fall patient satisfaction collect 6 month prior start nurse round 6 month start implementation nursing round . Fall rate collect pre-existing fall rate report report fall per 1000 patient day . Patient satisfaction collect pre-existing Avatar patient satisfaction survey randomly send discharged patient . All data analyze determine statistically significant difference patient fall rate , satisfaction , call light usage occur . A limitation study nurse medical surgical float pool may work 4 South subsequently assign 6 South within 6 month post-intervention time period . This potential movement nurse control experimental unit may influence result control unit . This address limit number float pool nurse schedule work experimental unit control unit six month follow education phase study .</detailed_description>
