	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome ( MS ) , comprised central obesity , glucose intolerance , hyperinsulinemia , low HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , high triglyceride ( TG ) hypertension , result markedly increase risk cardiovascular disease general population . The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP ATP III ) report recommend use five variable diagnosis MS include waist circumference ( WC ) , serum TG concentration , serum HDL-C concentration , blood pressure fast glucose concentration . A waist circumference 80 cm woman 90 cm men would better identify MS Asian population . However , study modify asian criterion metabolic syndrome hemodialysis ( HD ) patient scarce . We perform prevalence investigation , cross-sectional study , prospective investigation metabolic syndrome HD patient ( around 360 present ) . We enroll patient receive maintenance HD three month HD center . The patient hospitalize , suffer active malignancy , active infection , recent cardiovascular event surgery exclude begin study . Biochemistry anthropometric parameter include HDL-C , TG , insulin resistance index , high sensitivity C-reactive protein WC collect analyzed . We also prospectively establish mortality hospitalization index patient , study prognosis HD patient without metabolic syndrome . This study helpful understand whether application modify criterion metabolic syndrome HD patient capable predict cardiovascular event , hospitalization mortality rate .</brief_summary>
