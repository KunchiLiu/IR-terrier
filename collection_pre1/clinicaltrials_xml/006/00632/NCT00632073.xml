	<detailed_description>This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study investigate HIV antiviral response CSF vicriviroc add 2 week subject 's failing antiretroviral background regimen . The primary efficacy endpoint study mean change log10 CSF HIV RNA baseline Week 2 . The secondary efficacy endpoint proportion subject achieve CSF HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 2 . At Week 2 , subject 's background regimen optimize vicriviroc continue Week 24 . After complete Week 24 study , subject offer option continue open-label VCV 30 mg daily , appropriate , commercially available sponsor terminates clinical development VCV .
