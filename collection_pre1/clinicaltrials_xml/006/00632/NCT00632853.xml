	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide , carboplatin cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know radiation therapy regimen effective give together chemotherapy treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer . This randomized phase III trial compare different chest radiation therapy regimens see well work treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Regimens Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Cisplatin Etoposide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This 2-part , multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord gender , weight loss 6 month prior study entry ( ≤ 5 % body weight vs &gt; 5 % body weight ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) , radiotherapy technique ( intensity-modulated radiotherapy v 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ) , radiotherapy start time ( first cycle protocol chemotherapy , one cycle prior non-protocol chemotherapy v first cycle protocol chemotherapy , without prior non-protocol chemotherapy vs second cycle protocol chemotherapy , without prior non-protocol chemotherapy ) chemotherapy backbone : carboplatin v cisplatin . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective To determine whether administer high dose thoracic radiotherapy , 70 Gy ( 2 Gy once-daily 7 week ) 61.2 Gy ( 1.8 Gy once-daily 16 day follow 1.8 Gy twice-daily 9 day ) , improve median 2-year survival compare 45 Gy ( 1.5 Gy twice-daily 3 week ) patient limited stage small cell lung cancer . Secondary Objectives 1 . To compare treatment related toxic effect thoracic radiotherapy regimens patient limited stage small cell lung cancer 2 . To compare response rate , failure-free survival toxicity thoracic radiotherapy regimens patient limited stage small cell lung cancer 3 . To compare rate local relapse , distant metastasis brain metastasis regimens 4 . To compare patient ' quality life treatment regimens term physical symptom , physical function psychological state 5 . To describe pattern use thoracic intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) patient limited stage small cell lung cancer 6 . To examine blood-based biomarkers response resistance cisplatin ( carboplatin ) etoposide 7 . To evaluate correspondence increase plasma ProGRP concentration disease progression/recurrence 8 . To evaluate potential plasma ProGRP concentration baseline , cycle chemotherapy first evaluation follow completion chemotherapy predict PFS OS 9 . To evaluate correspondence longitudinal decrease plasma ProGRP concentration clinical response Part 1 : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo standard-dose ( 45 Gy give 30 treatment ) thoracic radiotherapy twice daily , 5 day week , 3 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV day 1 carboplatin IV etoposide IV day 1 , 2 , 3 . Arm II : Patients undergo higher-dose ( 70 Gy give 35 treatment ) thoracic radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 7 week . Patients also receive cisplatin carboplatin etoposide arm I . Arm III : ( discontinue 03/10/13 ) Patients undergo mid-dose ( 61.2 Gy give 34 treatment ) thoracic radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , initial 16 day ( approximately 3 week ) treatment twice daily , 5 day week , final 9 day ( approximately 2 week ) treatment . Patients also receive cisplatin etoposide . In arm , treatment cisplatin etoposide repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part 2 : An interim analysis conduct accrual 30 patient per arm one experimental arm base upon comparison treatment-related toxicity select . The toxic experimental arm discontinue , trial continue compare standard therapy ( arm I ) select experimental regimen ( arm II ) describe part 1 . Please see Arms section information regard Part 2 . Prophylactic cranial irradiotherapy ( PCI ) : Within 3-6 week completion chemotherapy , PCI offer patient complete tumor response ( CR ) near complete response ( nCR ) residual chest abnormality indeterminate nature follow completion combine modality therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year disease progression . At disease progression , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documentation Disease 1 . Histologically cytologically document small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) 2 . Limitedstage disease patient disease restrict one hemithorax regional lymph node metastasis , include ipsilateral hilar , ipsilateral contralateral mediastinal , ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node Patients disease involvement contralateral hilar supraclavicular lymph node eligible Patients pleural effusion visible plain chest radiograph , whether cytologically positive eligible unless negative thoracentesis Patients cytologically positive pleural pericardial fluid , regardless appearance plain xray eligible 2 . Measurable disease Patients must measurable disease , include lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 2 cm conventional technique OR ≥ 1 cm spiral CT scan 3 . Prior Treatment 1 . Patients may receive one one cycle chemotherapy prior enrol CALGB 30610 , must include carboplatin cisplatin etoposide . 2 . If patient one cycle cisplatin carboplatin/etoposide prior registration , patient must prior registration test outline protocol prior start first cycle chemotherapy . 3 . Additionally , patient also must meet eligibility criterion protocol prior receive first cycle chemotherapy . 4 . Registration CALGB 30610 must take place within 1421 day start nonprotocol therapy . 5 . Failing make patient NOT eligible CALGB 30610 . 6 . No prior radiotherapy chemotherapy ( except chemotherapy describe bullet ) SCLC 7 . No prior mediastinal thoracic radiotherapy 8 . Patients complete surgical resection disease eligible 4 .
