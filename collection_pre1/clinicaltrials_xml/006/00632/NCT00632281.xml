	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) good way treat tumor near thorax . Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) general term group technique design deliver radiation therapy way damage normal tissue less conventional radiotherapy . The two feature distinguish SBRT conventional therapy procedure decrease error patient position technology result radiation dose distribution conforms tightly tumor target . Patients receive either 48 Gy 60 Gy fraction depend type tumor . The majority patient treat 1 week , Monday Friday , Wednesday .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) tumor thorax relatively new therapy United States , use extensively Japan 10 year . This protocol seek enroll patient three broad category base histology clinical scenario : primary therapy non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , primary therapy thoracic metastasis , retreatment previously irradiate tumor lung . Primary lung tumor Several study publish describe utility Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) primary untreated lung tumor . In United States , influential experience Robert Timmerman University Indiana ( 7 ) . They enrol 37 patient dose escalation trial SBRT T1 N0 T2 N0 patient Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The trial begin 24 Gy give 3 fraction escalate 60 Gy give 3 fraction . Dose limited toxicity ( DLT ) define grade 3 pulmonary , esophageal , cardiac , pericardial toxicity , grade 4 toxicity ascribe protocol treatment use Common Toxicity Criteria National Cancer Institute . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) define dose less 2 5 enrol patient experienced DLT . The MTD determine trial criterion meet enrolled patient . Of 37 patient , 2 experience Grade 3 toxicity . One patient experience pneumonitis patient experience hypoxemia . Both patient respond therapy make full recovery . There long term complication report treatment mean follow-up 15 month .</detailed_description>
