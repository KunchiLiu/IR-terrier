	<brief_title>Low-dose RAD001 ( Everolimus ) Plus Cisplatin-HDFL Chemotherapy First-line Treatment Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-resectable gastric cancer incurable disease , median survival 4 month untreated . Systemic chemotherapy confers prolongation survival improvement quality life . Regimens contain cisplatin 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) widely adopt world . The overall response rate median overall survival P-HDFL regimen ( cisplatin weekly 24-hour infusion high-dose 5-FU leucovorin ) advance gastric cancer 60 % ( 45 % -76 % , 95 % C.I . ) 10 month , respectively . This regimen ( P-HDFL ) popular Taiwan high objective response rate low treatment-related toxicity . Adding third active chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin 5-FU doublet seem improve efficacy . Further , patient recurrent metastatic gastric cancer frequently associate poor general condition prohibits intensive chemotherapy . Therefore , combination P-HDFL biologic agent ( everolimus , etc . ) attractive alternative . PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway actively participate cell proliferation survival human gastric cancer . We recently demonstrate RAD001 ( everolimus ) , mTOR inhibitor , although modest growth inhibitory effect single agent , significant synergistic cytotoxicity cisplatin 5-FU gastric cancer cell . The concentration RAD001 need synergism cisplatin 5-FU low 0.5 5 nM . And , expect , RAD001 significant inhibition downstream molecules 4E-BP1 S6Kinase , human gastric cancer cell . It therefore reasonable conduct phase II study examine combination relatively low dose RAD001 P-HDFL may improve outcome advanced gastric cancer . This open-label , multi-center , phase II trial use low-dose RAD001 ( 10 mg po D1 , D8 , &amp; D15 ) plus P-HDFL chemotherapy ( cisplatin 35 mg/m2 ivd 24 hr D1 &amp; D8 ; 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 leucovorin 300 mg/m2 ivd 24 hr D1 , D8 , &amp; D15 ) chemotherapy-na√Øve patient unresectable locally advanced , recurrent metastatic gastric cancer . The treatment repeat every 28 day . The primary end-point objective response rate evaluate RECIST criterion , secondary end-points overall survival , progression-free survival safety profile . Approximately 41 patient enrolled order obtain 37 evaluable patient require Simon two-stage minimax design . All enrol patient subject toxicity evaluation , optionally correlative translational study biomarkers peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Patients massive malignant ascites optionally participate study biomarkers neoplastic cell ascites .</detailed_description>
