	<brief_title>Does Chewing Gum After Elective Laparoscopic Colectomy Surgery Decrease Ileus ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus remain source morbidity major determinant length stay abdominal surgery . This unfortunate complication may certainly affect patient 's satisfaction postoperative course . The postoperative care laparoscopic colectomy patient include intervention evidence-based . Despite evidence-based intervention , incidence ileus laparoscopic colectomy continue pose complication patient , staff , healthcare system . In time period January 1 , 2006 November 30 , 2006 total 172 laparoscopic colectomies St. Joseph 's Hospital 28 patient developed ileus . Six percent colectomy patient ' recovery alter prolonged ileus . This comparably slightly less National Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program 's data postoperative ileus 7.5 % ( Longo et al . 2000 ) . However , length stay patient ileus 8.4 day great non ileus patient , significant increase cost per ileus patient $ 15,422.86 . Clinicians devised strategy minimize postoperative ileus . Adjunct therapies motility agent , early postoperative feeding regimen , physical therapy test clinical trial , routinely use limited clinical efficacy ( Matros , et al . 2006 ) . Gum chewing , inexpensive intervention , theorized activate cephalic- vagal reflex , usually activate food , increase production gastrointestinal hormone associate bowel motility ( Asao , et al , 2002 ) . Four study examine gum chew intervention prevent ileus find . These relatively study sample postoperative abdominal surgical patient demonstrated inconsistency . Two study find chew gum group pass flatus bowel movement sooner control group . One study find decreased length stay . Two randomize control study find statistical significance gum chew control group far post-operative ileus length stay . Because small sample size four study inconsistencies result , enough evidence change practice . The inexpensive method gum chewing may useful decrease ileus post-operative colectomy patient , decrease cost length stay . It could also decrease pain , emesis , morbidity patient . There indication risk associate gum chew adjunct therapy along standard postoperative intervention . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES : In adult elective laparoscopic colectomy patient chew gum decrease ileus compare standard post-operative care ? STUDY DESIGN : A prospective , randomize control design SUBJECT SELECTION : ( Include inclusion/exclusion criterion ) All participant recruit St. Joseph 's Hospital . The sample consist patient 18 year age old identify adult admission , and/or pre-admission elective laparoscopic colectomy surgery . Inclusion criterion consist patient admit one surgical unit ( 3-1 ) November 1 , 2007 August 1 , 2008 non- emergent laparoscopic colectomy . Exclusion criterion consist patient history metastatic disease , history inflammatory bowel disease , abdominal radiation treatment , mint allergy ( gum mint flavor ) , dentures , nasogastric tube drainage beyond first postoperative morning , one bowel anastomosis surgery , conversion pen colectomy , admission ICI post-operatively . STATISTICAL METHODS , DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION : ( Include factor consider determine appropriate sample size ) Data analyze statistically . Descriptive statistic use describe entire sample , appropriate level measurement . Independent t-tests variable measure ordinal interval/ratio level chi-square dichotomous variable use compare two group demographic variable , hour since first flatus , first bowel movement Analysis co-variance may use statistically control medical condition find sample exclude could affect finding . STUDY PROCEDURES : ( Describe study method chronologically . Distinguish clearly treatment-related ( standard care ) study-related procedure subject undergo ) . NOTE : If proposal include genetic testing , information genetic testing must include . Please provide follow : 1 . The type study plan , 2 . What gene investigator look , know , 3 . Why genetic testing do ( i.e. , relevant overall protocol ) , 4 . Where work do . After approval St Joseph 's IRB SUNY Upstate 's IRB , elective laparoscopic colectomy patient identify participate surgeon . At time preoperative instruction , letter give send identify patient explain study ( Appendix C ) . The day pre-admission testing , patient contact study team member review study ask participate . If agree , consent sign subject assign number ensure confidentiality . The sample size 50 randomize block format , utilizing week number . The 38 week place box ; first 19 week select gum chew group , second 19 week select non chew group . Each participant study educate report nurse self report bed side bowel report sheet exact time hour flatus pass first bowel movement . The nursing staff 3-1 instructed monitor documentation gum chewing , first flatus near hour , first bowel movement near hour . The data collection form complete . The length patient stay generate discharge . The patient gum chew group ( intervention group ) chew one stick gum first post-operative day , nasogastric tube remove patient nasogastric tube , head bed elevated minimum 30 degree 30 minute , three time day set interval : 0900 , 1400 , 2100 . Sugar-free gum use previous study . Therefore , sugar free gum ( Orbit Spearmint Sugarless Gum ) use study . The gum keep Accudose cabinet distribute medication nurse . The gum chew regimen continue first bowel movement . All patient non-intervention group receive standard preoperative postoperative regimen . Patient demographic collect include gender , age , current medical condition , pre-operative medication , type surgery , operative duration minute , time leave OR , anesthesia duration minute , estimate operative blood loss , whether patient epidural PCA , date time nasogastric tube discontinue , length stay , date discharge , complication , post-operative ileus . Patients nurse instruct complete bedside bowel record near hour .</detailed_description>
