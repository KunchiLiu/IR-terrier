	<brief_summary>This study propose evaluate effect D-cycloserine ( DCS ) combine Virtual Reality exposure therapy sample patient develop posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) follow either event September 11 , 2001 , military service war Iraq . In addition , study hope determine whether common human genetic single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) growth factor , brain derive neurotrophic factor , BDNF ( Val66Met ) , predict treatment response PTSD . Overall , study aim 1 ) determine subject administer DCS show significantly large decrease symptom PTSD compare administer placebo , 2 ) determine subject administer DCS show decrease PTSD symptomatology significantly earlier ( measured week ) administer placebo , 3 ) determine difference symptomatology evident 6-month follow-up indicate long-term difference group , 4 ) determine BDNF SNP predict treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants 9/11-related military service Iraq War-related PTSD assign one two program , follow initial assessment . Both program include Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy ( VRET ) treatment PTSD well widely-used standard cognitive-behavioral therapy technique . The VRET comprise ten ninety minute session involve mental imagery well virtual reality presentation deliver special display worn head eye . The virtual reality simulation consist either image World Trade Center event September 11 , 2001 multiple scenario common military personnel assign Iraq . One group participant receive medication cycloserine ( seromycin ) one group receive placebo drug ( like sugar pill ) . Participants take dose medication day come laboratory Virtual Reality Exposure ( VRE ) session , 90 minute prior VRE session . Some subject study receive 100 mg dose cycloserine , subject study receive placebo ( sugar pill ) . This determine randomly ( flip coin ) . Neither patient treating clinician know pill patient receive ; however , arrangement may change medically necessary . Patients briefly assess well-being every session , reassess follow session three , session six , session ten change symptomatology . At completion treatment six month later , principal investigator one associate reinterview participant complete questionnaire .</detailed_description>
