	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot treatment trial evaluate efficacy oral micronized PROG cocaine-dependent woman . Since show ( Evans &amp; Foltin , 2006 ) oral micronized PROG attenuate positive subjective effect smoke cocaine female , male , preliminary data indicate oral micronized PROG also reduce smoked cocaine self-administration laboratory , PROG appear ideal potential candidate medication evaluate cocaine-dependent woman .

	<brief_title>Progesterone Treatment Cocaine-dependent Women : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aims : The primary aim direct treatment efficacy . Relatively unique cocaine treatment trial , one principal outcome measure time cocaine relapse . We hypothesize maintenance PROG increase time cocaine relapse compare maintenance placebo ( PBO ) . Another cocaine-related efficacy endpoint proportion patient achieve least 2 consecutive week cocaine abstinence ( base urine toxicology result ) double-blind treatment phase . Lastly , proportion cocaine-negative urine collect throughout treatment trial measure . We hypothesize woman PROG group show great reduction cocaine use compare PBO group . Secondary Aims : 1 ) Determine response laboratory stressor predict treatment outcome . We hypothesize woman great stress response worse treatment maintenance PROG reduce stress/anxiety thereby improve treatment outcome . 2 ) Determine treatment retention well PROG group compare PBO group determine maintenance PROG improve overall functioning compare maintenance PBO base Clinical Global Inventory ( CGI ) . We hypothesize woman PROG group well treatment retention improvement CGI score compare woman PBO group . Tertiary Aims : To conduct exploratory analysis determine whether 1 ) trauma history relate treatment outcomes 2 ) improvement treatment outcome measure related decrease HIV high-risk behavior .</detailed_description>
