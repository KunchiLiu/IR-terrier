	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . Secondary - To determine maximum tolerate dose SRT patient . - To determine objective tumor response rate term percentage tumor size change CT , percentage intensity change MRI , percentage change alfa fetoprotein patient treat therapy . - To determine value 4-dimensional CT liver cancer planning term extent liver motion ( three dimensionally ) percentage patient require breath gate due amplitude organ motion exceed 1 cm dimension . - To determine value breath gate liver cancer SRT term success rate breath gate percentage treatment time prolongation secondary gating . OUTLINE : Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy daily day 1-5 . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 3 month .</detailed_description>
