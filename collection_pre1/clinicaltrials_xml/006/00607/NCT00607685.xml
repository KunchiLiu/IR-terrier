	<brief_summary>Trabeculectomy effective method lower intraocular pressure glaucoma well control drop medication . The post-operative wound heal response remain major barrier surgical success . Scar tissue formation result occlusion surgical drainage site create . As consequence , intraocular pressure rise . The current use anti-scarring agent 5 Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , well establish method employ ophthalmologists clinically reduce postoperative scarring response . However , patient high risk bleb failure , repeat subconjunctival injection 5FU follow bleb needle often require result increased clinical load patient inconvenience . A slow release formulation 5FU would benefit release 5FU subconjunctival space extend period thereby provide prolong therapeutic effect . In addition , hyaluronic acid know possess antifibrotic property gel-like physical state , would potentially act physical tissue spacer may limit active subconjunctival scar site inject . We hypothesise inject mixture 5FU hyaluronic acid would give good outcome inject 5FU alone . The aim study determine whether bleb needle subconjunctival injection Viscoelastic/5FU formulation effective method prolong drug delivery prevent post-operative scarring response . This prospective case-controlled study involve patient already undergone trabeculectomy require bleb needle subconjunctival 5FU injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5FU vs 5FU With Viscoelastic Formulation Prevention Scarring Post-trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims The aim study determine whether needle conjunctival bleb trabeculectomy subconjunctival injection 5 Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) / viscoelastic formulation effective method prolong drug delivery prevent post-operative scarring conjunctiva . Study Design Cell Culture Experiments Cell culture experiment carry determine effect hyaluronic acid , vary commercially available concentration , human Tenon 's fibroblast , target cell type propose HA/ 5FU mixture . We also perform test examine pharmacokinetic drug release profile different 5FU/HA formulation . This allow u determine effective formulation use patient clinical arm study . Briefly , human Tenon 's fibroblast attain tissue explants cadaver eye grown confluent fetal calf serum contain standard antibiotic tissue culture , gentamicin amphotericin , place incubator 37°C 95 % humidity 5 % CO2 . The cell passaged confluent use experiment passages 3-6 . Alpha smooth muscle actin expression Tenon 's fibroblast seed 24 well plate incubate fetal calf serum ( FCS ) contain standard antibiotic tissue culture , gentamicin amphotericin , place incubator 37°C 95 % humidity 5 % CO2 . The culture medium remove 24 hour replace fresh medium describe . Collagen I production Standard 3-D collagen I gel seeded fibroblast gel contraction assay employ quantify collagen production fibroblast treat different HA concentration . Gels treat TGF beta ( know stimulator collagen I synthesis inducer alpha smooth muscle actin expression ie myofibroblast phenotype ) act positive control . Type I collagen derived rat tail mixed culture medium follow confluency , trypsinised cell resuspended mixture cast 24 well plate allow polymerise incubator 37°C . After polymerisation , gel gently detach plate cast suspended fresh medium describe All experiment conduct triplicate repeat 3 time . Human Tenon 's fibroblast culture fresh medium contain HA alone , 5-FU/HA ( HA concentrations10 , 14 , 23 mg/ml ) culture without HA 5FU ( control ) . Fibrosis scar response myofibroblasts assess Collagen I alpha smooth muscle actin ( ASMA ) expression quantify Real Time -Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) . WST-1 assay determine cell viability . 5-FU solution powder disperse HA mechanically stir vortex mixed . Our result show HA markedly reduce ASMA collagen I mRNA expression myofibroblasts compare control without HA . Treatment HA follow 5FU ( 10mg/ml ) pretreatment result great reduction ASMA collagen I expression compare HA treatment alone , statistical significance reach 23mg/ml HA ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Cell proliferation viability affect HA . Our team investigator complete experiment examine release 5FU 5FU/ HA mixture . 5FU solution powder mechanically stir vortex mixed HA release 5FU quantify use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . The concentration 5FU use 10mg/ml concentration HA use 10 , 14 23 mg/ml . The 5FU/HA mixture delay drug release 48 hour , HA 14mg/ml 23mg/ml showing great delay drug release 10mg/ml , ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . There significant difference rate drug release powder solution form 5FU although pH notably different ie 6.6 10 respectively . The result in-vitro study drug release assay demonstrate 5FU/HA mixture desire therapeutic effect Human Tenon 's myofibroblasts . The optimum concentration HA 23mg/ml would combine 5FU 10mg/ml . We expect 5FU would release mixture 48 hour ; HA 5FU anti-scarring effect subconjunctival space . Patient Recruitment : Patients recruit randomize first postoperative visit 5-FU injection indicate accord clinical parameter indicate active scar formation . ( usually first post-operative month suturelysis complete ) . All post operative care apart 5FU/viscoelastic mixture injection control group unchanged current treatment standard . At least 50 patient go trabeculectomy Singapore National Eye Centre recruit study glaucoma clinic Singapore National Eye Centre . This consist different type glaucoma . 25 patient receive subconjunctival injection 5FU bleb needle 25 receive injection 5FU/ viscoelastic formulation . Patient assessment examination baseline All patient ( case control ) follow examination : Snellen visual acuity , slit-lamp examination anterior segment , bleb intraocular pressure measurement Goldmann tonometer . Tonometry also perform pre injection use pneumatonometer ( Reichert ) accord manufacturer 's guideline . Colour photograph bleb capture store digitally mask bleb grade . The Visante OCT use image bleb morphology dark condition . It new non-contact instrument rapidly obtain high-resolution image angle . The image capture scan take less 10 second akin take photograph . The device allow qualitative quantitative angle imaging , objective reproducible . This take place prior needling procedure . Bleb needle &amp; subconjunctival injection Having take informed consent patient , patient assign either case control group . In brief , needle conjunctival bleb carry slit lamp use aseptic technique . The doctor perform procedure use sterile glove clean patient 's eyelid peri-orbital skin povidone iodine 10 % . The eye anaesthetise Guttae Tetracaine 0.5 % wire speculum insert separate eyelid . Povidone iodine insert conjunctival sac . 0.1ml lignocaine 2 % injected subconjunctival space , temporal nasal bleb needle bleb perform 27 guage needle attach 1ml syringe . 5FU solution ( 10mg/ml ) ( control arm ) 5FU/viscoelastic formulation ( 10mg/ml 5FU 23mg/ml HA , ( 50/50 ) volume/volume ) ( experimental arm ) inject posterior bleb needle complete . Injections give within quadrant bleb . Post injection conjunctival sac thoroughly rinse re-examined slit-lamp . The IOP check end procedure use Goldmann tonometer pneumotonometer . Patients receive current standard care respect intraoperative antifibrosis therapy timing frequency postoperative 5-FU . Further administration subconjunctival 5-FU solution 5FU/HA formulation , ( depend treatment arm patient initially assign ) subsequent office visit administer required accord current clinical practice patient treatment arm . This record study . Follow-up examination Bleb image Visante anterior segment OCT IOP measurement record every visit ie week 1 , 12 . The need needle intervention eg massage/suture removal/lysis ( relevant ) clinically decide ophthalmologist visit bleb image perform additional procedure perfomed fall research visit ie week 1 12 . Bleb grade slit lamp photograph perform baseline pre-injection week 12 .</detailed_description>
