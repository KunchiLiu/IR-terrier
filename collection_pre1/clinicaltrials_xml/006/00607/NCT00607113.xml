	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Avastin design prevent formation new blood vessel help cancer cell grow . RAD001 design block protein important growth cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . During Cycle 1 , one group receive Avastin group receive RAD001 . Each study cycle 3 week long . In Cycle 2 every cycle , participant group receive study drug . There equal chance assign either group . RAD001 Administration : RAD001 tablet take day mouth , follow large glass water . The tablet blister-pack aluminum foil . The blister open time take study drug . You may either take RAD001 empty stomach low-fat meal . Some example low-fat meal include : cereal fat-free milk , muffin bagel fat-free spread , fruit salad . You avoid take RAD001 large fatty meal low amount RAD001 body absorbs . Your dietary habit around time take RAD001 consistent possible throughout study . You take RAD001 time day . The study staff give medication diary bring every study visit . You ask use diary writing date time take RAD001 , many tablet take , side effect may experience . Avastin Administration : Avastin give needle vein arm . The first dose give 90 minute . If intolerable side effect occur , second dose give 60 minute , intolerable side effect occur , dose give 30 minute . Other Medications : If experience side effect Avastin infusion ( fever/chills ) , may receive additional medicine ( ) time later Avastin dose , order decrease risk side effect . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive assign study drug . At begin Cycle 2 every cycle , ask side effect experience . You complete physical exam perform , include measurement vital sign weight . Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine also collect routine test . On Day 8 Cycles 1 2 , 2 teaspoon blood drawn routine test . These blood draw may do local lab closer home . Every 9 week , check status disease , either CT scan MRI scan tumor ( ) . The scan type perform screening . You also additional blood drawn ( 1-2 tablespoon time ) check tumor marker find increase blood screening test . In order learn flow blood tumor , non-routine functional CT scan perform end Cycles 1 3 . When possible , scan perform time routine CT scan . Length Study Treatment : You may receive 12 cycle study treatment , long benefit . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . RAD001 commercially available FDA approve type cancer . Avastin commercially available FDA approve treatment advance cancer colon rectum . At time , drug combination use research . Up 36 patient enrol study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
