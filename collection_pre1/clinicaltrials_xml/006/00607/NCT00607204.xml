	<detailed_description>The amount sleep people require depend many factor , include age , expert agree adult need 7 8 hour sleep night . People sleep shorter long amount time may risk develop memory problem , heart disease , obesity , diabetes . The duration time sleep regulate interaction circadian pacemaker , biological clock , sleep homeostat , internal account amount sleep person receive recently . It unknown whether biological genetic basis amount sleep person need . This inpatient study examine two extreme sleep group : short sleeper sleep 6.5 less hour night long sleeper sleep 9 hour night . Participants expose identical sleep opportunity live condition . Using hormone analysis examine participant ' circadian rhythm , researcher evaluate biological difference people undergo sleep process . Results study may help researcher understand whether sleep duration sleep need differ among people biological genetic variation . Over period 4 6 week , potential study participant attend 4 6 screen visit , include medical history review , physical exam , blood urine collection , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) measure electrical activity heart , psychological assessment , overnight stay sleep laboratory . For 3 week , potential participant also wear activity monitor , record sleep habit electronically daily diary . Participants eligible study spend 28 day Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit Clinical Translational Sciences Center Brigham Women 's Hospital . Participants access clock , radio , television , computer , allow outside contact . Most day participant remain bed 10 14 hour ; however , select time study , participant remain inactive period 32 64 hour stay awake 32 40 hour . Throughout study , participant ' sleep pattern monitor continuously wrist activity recorder . Heart rhythm , brain electrical activity , eye movement , temperature also measure continuously . At different time throughout study , participant undergo urine , saliva , blood collection ; alertness , mood , performance evaluation ; blood pressure measurement . Upon release research center , participant maintain sleep diary 3 week .</detailed_description>
