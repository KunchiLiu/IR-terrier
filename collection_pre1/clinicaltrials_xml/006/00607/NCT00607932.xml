	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility Brassica vegetable intake indole-3-carbinol supplement use patient prostate cancer prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) recurrence prostatectomy . - Identify adverse event patient . - Quantify effect intervention PSA patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify pretreatment prostat-specific antigen ( PSA ) growth rate ( low [ 0.00-0.15 ] v medium [ 0.16-0.30 ] v high [ &gt; 0.30 ] ) . They randomize 1 3 treatment arm , randomization status arm II III double-blinded . - Arm I ( Brassica vegetable ) : Patients consume Brassica vegetable least 2 serving ( ½ cup/serving ) daily 6 month . Patients meet one-on-one study dietician , instructed potential health benefit Brassica vegetables purchase preparation vegetable . Patients undergo telephone counsel periodically month 1-5 , monitor progress identify barrier adherence develop solution overcome barrier . - Arm II ( Placebo ) : Patients receive oral placebo daily 6 month . - Arm III ( Indole-3-carbinol supplement ) : Patients receive oral indole-3-carbinol supplement ( capsule ) daily 6 month . Blood urine sample ( urinary isothiocyanate level ) collect baseline 2 , 4 , 6 month . Patients complete questionnaire assess demographic , family cancer history , health history measuring change medication , lifestyle , adverse event , health . Medical record review prostate cancer-related information , surgical date , dose type radiation , PSA history .</detailed_description>
