	<detailed_description>Thermoregulation major problem low birth weight infant . The EPICure study show 36 % infant bear 24 25 week gestation admission temperature le 35 degree Celsius . Hypothermia associate increase risk morbidity mortality . The HeLP trial hop address issue use polyethylene occlusive wrap apply immediately delivery infant bear less 28 week gestation . Forty-five center currently involve study . Infant enrollments begin December 2004 . Primary outcome : To determine polyethylene occlusive wrap apply immediately delivery infant bear 24+0 27+6 week gestation result decrease mortality compare conventional method drying . Because increased mortality variable center specific resuscitation practice , infant bear less 24 week gestation randomize part separate Pilot Study center may choose wish participate group . Secondary outcome : The key secondary outcome axillary temperature take introduction warm environment NICU . We also record clinically important variable include : acidosis , hypotension , hypoglycaemia , seizure , patent ductus arteriosus , respiratory distress syndrome/chronic lung disease , necrotizing enterocolitis head ultrasound result . Length stay cause death discharge also record . Long-term follow-up critical understanding implication new intervention . As , ask parent hospital agree participate follow-up study permission contact approximately 18 month birth . Preterm infant meet eligibility criterion randomly assign within three gestational age stratum ( le 24 week , 24+0 25+6 week gestation , 26+0 27+6 week gestation ) either occlusive skin wrap group standard care ( non-wrap ) group .</detailed_description>
