	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) autosomal dominant genetic disorder lipoprotein metabolism characterize markedly elevate low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , premature onset atherosclerosis development xanthomata . Patients homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) severe disease present childhood total cholesterol typically 650 1000 mg/dL range . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , consist 4-week screening period , 26 week treatment , 24-week post- treatment follow-up period ( exception patient enrol open-label extension study , Study 301012-CS6 ; NCT00694109 ) . Eligible patient randomize 2:1 ratio receive 200 mg mipomersen matching volume placebo subcutaneous ( SC ) injection weekly . Patients weigh &lt; 50 kg receive low dose 160 mg mipomersen matching volume placebo SC injection weekly . Patients stable ( &gt; =12 week ) regimen allow lipid-lowering therapy screen , require remain dose regimen throughout study . Patients return study center clinical evaluation every week first 4 week treatment , every 4 5 week remainder treatment period , monthly post-treatment evaluation ( follow-up ) period . The primary endpoint assessment Week 28 . Following treatment Week 28 evaluation , eligible patient tolerate study drug could elect enroll open-label extension study ( Study 301012-CS6 ; NCT00694109 ) . Patients participate open-label extension study require return study center clinical evaluation least twice post-treatment follow-up period , include end-of-study termination visit end 24-week period .</detailed_description>
