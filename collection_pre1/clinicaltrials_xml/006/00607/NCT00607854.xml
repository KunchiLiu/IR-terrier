	<brief_title>Safety Ibritumomab Tiuxetan ( Zevalin® ) Combination With Fludarabine-based Reduced Intensity Conditioning ( RIC ) Regimen ( ZEVALLO 2007 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit Zevalin® set autologous stem cell transplantation largely report . The addition Zevalin® fludarabine-based Reduced Intensity Conditioning regimen already evaluate set allo-SCT result report far seem promise without overwhelm toxicity neither delay hematologic recovery . The assumption addition Zevalin® condition regimen might improve lymphoma control demonstration nucleoside analog fludarabine synergize optimally RIT lead u conduct trial use follow preparative regimen : rituximab 250 mg/m² day -21 -14 , Zevalin® 0,4 mCi/Kg body weight day -14 , fludarabine 30 mg/m² intravenously day -6 -2 , Busulfan orally ( 4 mg/Kg body weight ) intravenously ( 0,8 mg/Kg body weight ) day -5 -4 ATG ( Thymoglobulin® ) 2,5 mg/Kg body weight intravenously day -1 . Cyclosporine A administer 2 3 mg/Kg body weight day -1 day 28 follow dose reduction . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Zevalin® Reduced Intensity Conditioning regimen follow allogenic stem cell support patient aggressive lymphomas responsive salvage chemotherapy regimen Patients follow begin RIC regimen day 365 primary secondary objective study regular basis depend practice centre . The evaluation include physical examination ( performance status , hematologic assessment , acute chronic GVH disease ) , biologic test ( blood screen blood count , renal hepatic function , B T-cell recovery , chimerism analysis , response assessment ) complementary examination ( marrow biopsy , tomography scan , positron emission tomography , … ) .</detailed_description>
