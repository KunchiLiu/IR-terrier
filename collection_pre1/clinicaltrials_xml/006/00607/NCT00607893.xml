	<brief_summary>Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) condition person experience frequent breathing pause sleep , also know sleep apnea . There evidence recurrent sleep arousal associate shortage oxygen body may increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . It believe treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) may reduce certain risk factor heart disease , include marker inflammation oxidative stress . This study evaluate effectiveness CPAP reduce CVD risk factor people SDB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Reducing Oxidative Stress Individuals With Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 18 million Americans affected SDB . SDB involve repeat sleep arousal cause breathing difficulty . These frequent sleep disruption may cause person experience daytime drowsiness , impaired mental functioning , trouble concentrate stay alert . SDB also associate increase risk certain cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure heart disease . Researchers believe increase oxidative stress inflammation associate SDB may play role physiologic pathway link SDB CVD . However , information SDB-CVD relationship need able identify risk factor CVD discover best mean treatment . CPAP , current treatment SDB , act deliver air mask sleep . CPAP help improve overnight breathe quality sleep may , turn , decrease oxidative stress associate CVD risk . This study compare effectiveness CPAP versus placebo CPAP reduce CVD risk factor , oxidative stress marker , people SDB . Participation study last 2.5 4 month include four five study visit . During first study visit , participant undergo CPAP titration study , involve appropriate CPAP mask fit overnight sleep test determine best CPAP pressure , well low placebo pressure , participant . Participants also provide educational information diet , sleep , use CPAP treatment sleep apnea . After titration study , participant ask wear fitted CPAP mask every night next 2 week , use low ( placebo ) pressure one week use high pressure week . During time , technician contact participant every 3 4 day address question problem CPAP equipment . One month later , participant able tolerate use CPAP night attend Visit 2 . This second visit include overnight sleep study without wear CPAP mask ; blood saliva collection ; cheek brushing genetic material ; test diabetes , artery stiffness , circulation ; body fat measurement ; questionnaire . Participants randomly assign use either high pressure CPAP low pressure CPAP 8 week . Visit 3 occur 1 week begin CPAP treatment include fast blood test . During treatment , participant periodically contact technician check equipment status . Upon complete treatment , participant undergo repeat test Visit 2 , except wear CPAP mask overnight sleep test . This fourth study visit mark completion treatment participant assign low pressure CPAP . Participants assign high pressure CPAP ask use CPAP 4 week . These participant return end 4 week final visit , include repeat sleep study test .</detailed_description>
