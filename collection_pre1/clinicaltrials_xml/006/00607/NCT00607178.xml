	<brief_title>The Efficacy Influenza Vaccine Reducing Cardiovascular Events Patients With Coronary Artery Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A connection infectious process atherosclerosis repeatedly report [ 1 ] . Acute respiratory infection find associate myocardial infarction ( MI ) [ 2,3 ] number epidemiological study find mortality attributable cardiovascular disease increase influenza epidemic [ 4 ] . Naghavi et al [ 5 ] case-control study patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) find vaccination influenza negatively associate development new MI influenza season . While clinical trial find influenza vaccine effective secondary prevention cardiovascular adverse event [ 6,7 ] , large trial [ 8 ] fail approve efficacy . Furthermore , recent review publish trial subject conclude frailty selection bias use non-specific endpoint cause mortality lead cohort study greatly exaggerate vaccine benefit remain evidence base currently insufficient indicate magnitude mortality benefit vaccination program [ 9 ] . This study aim assess efficacy vaccine secondary prevention cardiovascular event MI stable angina ( SA ) patient use specific endpoint include reliable quantitative tool .</detailed_description>

Typical rise gradual fall ( troponin ) rapid rise fall ( CKMB ) biochemical marker myocardial necrosis least one following : Ischemic symptom Development pathologic Qwaves ECG ECG change indicative ischemia ( ST segment elevation depression ) ; OR Coronary artery intervention ( e.g. , coronary angioplasty ) . 2 . Pathologic finding acute MI [ 12 ] Patients stable angina pectoris document coronary artery stenosis ( angiography ) . Any acute disease Chronic liver kidney disease Conditions accompany immunosuppression ( like organ transplantation , HIV ) Diagnosed malignancy Incubation influenza vaccine within past 5 year Any psychological disease interfere regular followup Congestive heart failure ( Killip class IV ) Unstable angina , contradiction vaccine incubation ( like egg allergy ) .</criteria>
