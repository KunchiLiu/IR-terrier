	<brief_title>Clubfoot DNA Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clubfoot birth defect occur alone ( isolation ) part disease like cerebral palsy ( CP ) . Genetic linkage research tool DNA sample test genetic landmark ( marker ) whose location chromosomes know . Genes marker physically close one another chromosome say tightly link gene marker locate far apart . This give clue search gene cause isolated clubfoot . If appear high correlation family member ' inheritance particular marker , inheritance trait study ( case clubfoot ) , area chromosome near marker search likely gene cause trait . It hop genetic linkage research might eventually result new improve way determine individual family high risk clubfoot development new improve way treat clubfoot . Our research staff obtain information subject family call pedigree . We administer one page questionnaire mother ( ) affect individual ( ) . This questionnaire ask mother 's experience pregnancy ( e.g . Did take multivitamin ? Did smoke drink ? etc . ) Each study participant ( affected non-affected individual ) ask provide DNA blood sample . If collect blood sample possible also obtain DNA collect saliva sample . Samples DNA processing store accord follow repository guideline . Patient/donor-subject information , questionnaire , consent maintain orthopaedic research coordinator . Samples make investigator affiliate UT Southwestern wish study genetic factor cause clubfoot ; example , recently approach Jacqueline Hecht ( UT Health Science Center , Houston ) Matthew Dobbs ( Washington University , St. Louis ) regard participation multicenter trial . Samples de-identified include personal information would link sample donor subject . Primary investigator sub-investigators determine sample use . Additional research utilizing subject ' sample approve TSRHC Research Advisory panel IRB UT Southwestern .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For family include study least one person family affect Idiopathic Talipes Equinovarus ( clubfoot ) . If person satisfies criterion , affect person his/her parent include study . If individual family also affect ( e.g . cousin ) , individual also invite participate study along parent , sibling family member link two affected individual ( e.g . grandparent ) . Inability speak read English Spanish Should major birth defect ( e.g . Heart defect , Downs Syndrome cerebral palsy ) .</criteria>
