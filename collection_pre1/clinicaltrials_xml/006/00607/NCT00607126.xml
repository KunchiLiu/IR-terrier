	<brief_summary>Locomotor train new exercise modality emphasize task specificity promote learn neural plasticity . It report improve walking patient stroke , spinal cord injury cerebral palsy . In study , 40 patient impaired ambulation due Multiple Sclerosis randomize receive 36 session either locomotor training standard resistive exercise intervention.The locomotor training accomplish via robotic device , Lokomat , move patient 's leg treadmill suspend harness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , subject confirm diagnosis Multiple Sclerosis randomize one two treatment arm . Subjects Lokomat arm train Lokomat supervise physical therapist 20-30 minutes/session 3 times/week . The Lokomat robotic exoskeleton enables subject step move treadmill . Subjects suspend harness Lokomat full partial body weight support need . After train Lokomat , practice overground walk 10 minute . The treatment arm subject engage resistance training weight resistance elastic band match Lokomat group intensity , duration frequency . practice overground walk . Primary outcome measure speed accomplish 25 ' timed walk .</detailed_description>
