	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assess Security Dose Reduction Ritonavir HIV-Infected Patients Treatment With Tipranavir/Ritonavir 500/200 mg Every 12 Hours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tipranavir efficacy rescue treatment HIV-infected patient assessed RESIST study , include patient wide antiretroviral experience find viral failure despite PI-based antiretroviral therapy resistance test show presence major mutation protease gene . In study treatment tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg dose every 12 hour related major probability achieve undetectable viral load 48 week follow-up , compare conventional PI ( 33.6 % vs. 15.3 % , respectively ) . However , tipranavir clinical efficacy limit appearance adverse event , mainly gastrointestinal level , also alter lipid profile elevate transaminase plasmatic concentration . According data BI 1182.52 study , response tipranavir relate plasma trough concentration . So , concentration higher 20 mmol/L ( 10 time IC90 adjust bind protein HIV PI-resistant-strains ) relate major probability achieve viral replication suppression . This concentration achieve 77 % 48 % patient receive tipranavir 500 mg every 12 hour co-administered 200 100 mg ritonavir every 12 hour respectively . Furthermore , viral load diminution similar patient treat 100 200 mg ritonavir every 12 hour , long number mutation less 20 . These data state importance put together virological ( mutation protease gene ) pharmacokinetic data ( trough level ) antiretroviral treatment benefit maximize . The subanalysis include 157 patient BI 1182.52 study 311 patient RESIST study show virological response patient treatment tipranavir/ritonavir well patient IQ high 25-50 . With data follow conclusion infer : tipranavir drug high antiretroviral activity , also presence major mutation protease gene . However , necessity co-administered 400 mg ritonavir daily , limit efficacy treatment HIV-infected patient , due high incidence gastrointestinal adverse event . Nevertheless , trough level tipranavir propose minimum effective concentration patient previous experience protease inhibitor ( IP ) . Furthermore , number mutation protease gene limited , difference reduction viral load patient treat tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg 500/100 mg every 12 hour . At last , efficacy tipranavir treatment closely related inhibition quotient ( IQ ) concentration obtain consider isolated . Considering previous argument , hypothesize , base every subject IQ , could possible identify patient HIV-infected treatment tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg every 12 hour could take advance reduction ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hour , without compromise viral replication control . This strategy could improve tolerability treatment , could result good adherence less proportion treatment abandon due reason .</detailed_description>
