	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Stomach Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective disease control rate ( i.e. , partial complete response define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria stable disease ≥ 16 week ) patient locally advance metastatic adenocarcinoma stomach gastroesophageal junction treat AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess median time disease progression , median overall survival , 1-year survival rate patient . II . To assess toxicity AZD0530 patient . III . To evaluate potential predictive marker assess pretreatment intratumoral level src , Y419 phospho-src ( P-Src ) , c-terminal src kinase ( Csk ) archival tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 2 month .</detailed_description>
