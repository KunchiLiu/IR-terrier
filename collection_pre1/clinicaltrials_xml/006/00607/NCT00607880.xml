	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving chemotherapy drug implant port reduces need multiple needle stick . It yet know whether one type port effective another reduce infection side effect associate long-term port use . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial compare two type port patient cancer receive intravenous chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Types Ports Patients With Cancer Receiving Intravenous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare rate port failure , define occurrence port malfunction port infection within 12 month port insertion , patient cancer require long-term adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy undergo insertion newly design , FDA-approved Vortex® implantable vascular access port vs conventional vascular access port . Secondary - To compare rate port malfunction port infection 6 12 month port insertion . - To compare rate central vein thrombosis 6 12 month port insertion . - To compare rate port removal reason infection occlusion 6 12 month port insertion . - To compare rate termination use indwell port 6 12 month port insertion . - To compare death cause . - To compare incidence port-related intervention 6 12 month port insertion . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo insertion conventional vascular access port . Patients receive standard chemotherapy . - Arm II : Patients undergo insertion Vortex® implantable vascular access port . Patients receive standard chemotherapy . All episodes access port document 12 month port insertion . Information include reason port access difficulty access collect . Complications , occlusion infection , implant duration , incidence port-related intervention assess 6 12 month port insertion .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Diagnosis malignancy require intravenous chemotherapy ≥ 6 month Must undergo entire course chemotherapy Mayo Clinic Jacksonville , unless outside treat institution agree submit research data sheet Mayo Clinic Scheduled time frame regular use vascular access port ≥ 3 month port insertion PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Life expectancy ≥ 6 month No active skin condition implicate elevate risk local systemic infectious noninfectious complication , include follow : Current skin infection Cutaneous lymphoma Autoimmune disorder Active vasculitis Connective tissue diseases No know active infection require antibiotic therapy time port implantation Patients without active infection chronic antibiotic suppressive therapy eligible No concurrent illness require chronic anticoagulation Patients develop comorbidities require chronic anticoagulation study period eligible PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
