	<brief_title>Hormone Responses During Hypoglycemia Accuracy Continuous Glucose Monitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study undertaken compare counterregulatory hormone responses mild gradual reduction plasma glucose young child T1DM versus responses adolescent . The study perform close supervision professional staff DirecNet center frequent bedside monitor plasma glucose concentration ensure clinically significant hypoglycemia prevent develop . All subject admit CRC IV line blood sample inserted evening prior study reduce stress morning study . The study procedure simplify make less invasive comparison clamp standard insulin infusion study ( i.e . one IV blood sample need ) limit enrollment insulin pump-treated subject basal rate modestly increase produce hypoglycemic stimulus . Monsod colleague use procedure increase basal insulin infusion dose induce gradual fall plasma glucose youth type 1 diabetes study compare ability injection glucagon epinephrine treat mild hypoglycemia . It particularly important note blood glucose level fall 60 mg/dl , blood sample obtain hypoglycemia immediately correct intravenous administration exogenous glucose . In recent DirecNet study , ~25 % child adolescent plasma glucose level 60 mg/dl typical night rise ~50 % subject antecedent exercise late afternoon . Moreover , frequency mild well severe hypoglycemia substantially high pre-school child child adolescent . This safe rigorously design study provide important new information regard role inadequate counter-regulation increase risk hypoglycemia young child T1DM . Real-time continuous glucose sense system offer potential markedly low risk hypoglycemia youth T1DM . However , DirecNet inpatient accuracy study demonstrate first generation device inaccurate blood glucose lower less 70 mg/dl . In study , child T1DM 3-17 year age admit CRC approximately 26 hour wear 1-2 Medtronic MiniMed CGMS 1-2 Cygnus GlucoWatch G2 Biographer continuous glucose monitor . In every subject study , blood sample obtain every 30-60 minute indwell intravenous catheter measurement reference plasma glucose level DirecNet Central Laboratory . The Guardian-RT continuous glucose monitor system real-time continuous glucose monitor considerable promise use child diabetes . Therefore , secondary aim study obtain important data regard accuracy system hypoglycemia young child , well adolescent . The Guardian-RT approve FDA detect trend track pattern adult ( 18 old ) indicate adjunctive rather replacement standard home glucose monitoring device . The sensor approve FDA use 72 hour function longer period time . The primary objective study compare glucose level counter-regulatory hormone response occur hypoglycemia young child diabetes , glucose level counter regulatory hormone response occur old child diabetes . We hypothesize child young age group counterregulatory response lower glucose level reach compare child old age group . Secondary objective : 1 . To assess sign symptoms different glucose level hypoglycemia young child compare old child . Furthermore , symptom compare counter regulatory hormone level two age group . Symptoms assess use physiologic data use age-appropriate questionnaire would complete test subject ( appropriate ) parent . 2 . To assess whether difference counter-regulatory hormone response age group , among least 2-3 episode hypoglycemia per day night prior study compare occasional episode hypoglycemia prior test . Subjects wear Guardian RT 6 day ( +1 day ) prior test ass episodes hypoglycemia . 3 . To examine accuracy Guardian-RT hypoglycemia child type 1 diabetes . Beginning Study When child enters study , follow do : 1 . Informed consent obtain eligible subject ( age 3 &lt; 7 12 &lt; 18 year , T1D &gt; 1 year , insulin pump use ) . 2 . On day enrollment hemoglobin A1c obtain instruction give use Guardian RT . The study personnel supervise subject parent insert sensor clinic . The subject instruct complete least four glucose measurement day use study HGM . Instructions also give response Guardian RT alarm prior CRC admission . 3 . The subject return 18-hour overnight CRC admission approximately 6 day ( + 1 day ) enrollment visit . - Subjects continue use Guardian RT sensor insert prior admission . - For subject sufficient size accommodate additional device , second Guardian-RT sensor insert . An intravenous catheter insert reference measurement ( glucose , epinephrine , norepinephrine , cortisol , glucagon GH ) , draw subcutaneous insulin infusion test follow morning send central laboratory . - For subject sufficient weight ( subject &gt; 14.9kg reinfusion center &gt; 26.3kg discard center ) accommodate volume blood require , blood glucose measurement make every 30 minute admission allow assessment accuracy Guardian-RT . - For subject sufficient weight accommodate volume blood require , blood glucose measurement make every 15 minute two hour dinner . This allow assessment accuracy Guardian-RT detecting change period rise blood glucose . - At approximately 8:00 a.m. subcutaneous insulin infusion test start . - Prior start test , HypoMonÂ® may place around subject 's chest use adjustable strap . - The glucose concentration measure study HGM must &gt; 110 mg/dL start test . - At start test , basal insulin rate increase approximately 25-50 % provide gradual decline blood glucose . A small priming bolus dose insulin equal approximately one hour subject 's usual basal dose may also give discretion investigator addition 25-50 % increase basal insulin . - The basal insulin rate may increase additional amount additional bolus insulin dos may give discretion investigator order get gradual decline glucose concentration . - Blood sample collect laboratory glucose check study HGM venous blood every 15 minute glucose level reach 100 mg/dL . Thereafter , study HGM use check glucose level venous blood every 5-10 minute depend rate fall glucose level end study . - Blood sample collect laboratory determination hormone concentration baseline ( increase insulin infusion ) glucose level &lt; 90 , &lt; 80 , &lt; 70 , &lt; 60 mg/dL . - Subjects ( parent appropriate ) ask question regard symptom hypoglycemia time glucose level check study HGM . - Once endpoint reach ( first time glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL use study HGM ) , basal rate return normal , subject treat intravenous glucose breakfast provide . 4 . Prior discharge , sensor remove download subject 's insulin pump download possible About 6 day ( +1 day ) follow enrollment visit , subject inpatient CRC admission approximately 18 hour . Subjects admit approximately 3:00 PM allow sufficient time calibrate sensor dinner provide . - Areas Guardian RT sensor worn first week assess study personnel skin irritation . - The Guardian RT , HGM , pump data previous week review change make diabetes management need . - Subjects continue use Guardian RT sensor last inserted home . If sensor function properly , new sensor insert . - For subject sufficient size , additional Guardian-RT sensor insert calibrate approximately two hour later . An intravenous catheter insert arm vein collection blood sample admission . The area catheter insert may numb Elamax EMLA cream prior catheter insertion . Once study endpoint reach ( first time glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL use study HGM ) , basal rate return normal subject treat intravenous glucose . An additional blood sample collect laboratory determination glucose hormone concentration 15 minute follow treatment intravenous glucose . Subjects give breakfast discharge . Prior discharge , sensor ( ) remove download . The subject 's insulin pump download possible .</detailed_description>
