	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Safety Terbutaline Children With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10 child recruit five center United States participate study . The data collect pilot study use determine whether proceed randomize trial use dose terbutaline use pilot study need additional pilot test low dose terbutaline . Beginning Study When chid enters study , follow do : 1 . After eligibility determine , informed consent assent obtain parent/guardian subject . 2 . An unblinded CGM use blood ketone check morning subject least one week . Subjects may ask wear Actiwatch monitor night . 3 . Terbutaline initiate CRC admission continue follow CRC stay 21-28 day . â€¢ Subjects weigh 25 45 kg treat nightly oral dose 2.5 mg subject weigh 45 kg treat 3.75 mg. 4 . The CRC admission last approximately 18-20 hour include follow : - Monitoring effect terbutaline measurement heart rate , blood pressure , blood interstitial glucose , lactate , ketone , NEFA , B-OH butyrate - Assessment accuracy CGM comparing sensor glucose value blood glucose value 5 . The outpatient phase last 21-28 day include follow : - Nightly use terbutaline describe - Use unblinded CGM daily basis monitor glucose level - Subjects may ask wear Actiwatch monitor overnight - Measurement blood ketone morning - Phone call subject first outpatient day terbutaline use approximately every 3 day ( twice week ) end subject 's follow . 6 . Second CRC admission mirror first admission 21 28 day initiation terbutaline 7 . Follow 1-2 week discontinuation terbutaline glucose control back prestudy level . Procedures home hospital stay 1 . Terbutaline take orally day prior bedtime . 2 . Each subject continue use CGM , instruction use close 24/7 possible . 3 . Prior phone call , subject instruct download CGM either email fax file clinic glucose data review phone contact . 4 . Each subject provide HGM test strip . The HGM use calibration CGM confirm high low value CGM prior act . It download end-of-study CRC admission . The subject ask measure blood ketone morning use meter strip provide . 5 . Each subject may ask wear Actiwatch night measure movement subject sleeping . 6 . Phone call subject make first outpatient day terbutaline use approximately every 3 day ( twice week ) end subject 's follow plus 7 day terbutaline discontinue . 7 . Prior end-of-study CRC admission , follow-up visit occur time discretion investigator . End study admission The end-of study CRC admission occur 21-28 day outpatient phase.The protocol identical protocol first CRC admission . The dinner breakfast meal identical meal give first admission . The sensor remove prior discharge , unless investigator decides would beneficial continue CGM 1-2 week assist maintenance glucose control terbutaline stop .</detailed_description>
