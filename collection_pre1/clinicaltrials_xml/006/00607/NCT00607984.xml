	<brief_summary>The prognosis child adolescent high risk tumor central nervous system miscellaneous solid tumor poor despite modern treatment protocol . Frequently , physician suggest additional therapy high dose chemotherapy good initial response standard dose treatment obtain , reduce chance tumor recur . We propose regimen high dose thiotepa melphalan follow rescue patient 's previously store hematopoietic ( blood manufacturing ) system blood stem cell . The aim study prove therapy tolerable child adolescent , result tolerable level toxicity , improve survival group child compare standard therapy give past</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration High Dose Thiotepa Melphalan With Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Children Adolescents With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite progress treatment child adolescent suffer solid tumor tumor CNS , patient metastatic disease ( disease high risk feature ) continue suffer relapse treat standard chemotherapy protocol . In patient , high-dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) propose consolidation therapy high-risk population . The paradigm successfully utilization autologous stem cell transplantation childhood neuroblastoma . A large , well perform , randomize study child high risk neuroblastoma show application autologous stem cell transplant lead improve disease free overall survival , effect augment administration biological agent specific activity tumor . Smaller non-controlled study case series show ASCT feasible child solid tumor tumor central nervous system . Despite many report literature , little agreement among investigator ideal combination chemotherapeutic agent include high dose chemotherapy regimen administer prior ASCT patient . The choice agent protocols dictate use drug whose dose limit toxicity hematopoietic , concern obviate subsequent infusion autologous stem cell . As , majority HDC protocols exploit steep dose response curve alkylating agent , administration high dos usually limit fear inducing permanent myeloablation . A major limitation many HDC protocol many alkylating agent use already utilized front line protocol . A problem design HDC protocols unique patient suffer CNS tumor , administer agent must traverse blood brain barrier ( BBB ) order reach site tumor . A major breakthrough application HDC child nwith CNS tumor occur use Thiotepa , highly myeloablative bifunctional alkylating agent partition equally across BBB . Thiotepa mainstay HDC protocols child CNS tumor . Hara et al . pioneer novel combination Thiotepa Melpahlan , also alkylating agent , treatment child variety solid tumor . They catalogue toxicity protocol , suggest dose level drug combination lead toxicity level grade â‰¤3 . Of note , Hara series , patient also receive high dose Busulfan . We pilot Hara protocol center 14 patient find dose level suggest study tolerate well child center . We decide modify Hara protocol reduce dos Thiotepa Melphalan reduce incidence severe gastrointestinal toxicity patient experience . In addition , two patient succumb fulminant gram positive infection original protocol , institute empiric administration Vancomycin primary treatment febrile neutropenia patient , pending result blood culture . We also decide restrict admission protocol patient minimal amount residual disease measure MRI / CT scan biochemical marker prior transplant .</detailed_description>
