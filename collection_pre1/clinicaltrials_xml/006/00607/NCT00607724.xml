	<brief_title>GDC-0449 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety tolerability escalate dos systemic Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . - To estimate maximum tolerate dose GDC-0449 patient . - To define dose-limiting toxicity GDC-0449 patient . - To characterize pharmacokinetic property GDC-0449 follow single dose multiple dos . - To determine recommended phase II dose schedule GDC-0449 efficacy test base achievement target exposure acceptable safety profile . Secondary - To determine whether inhibition Hedgehog ( Hh ) signal GDC-0449 reliably measure human hair follicle define relationship pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect surrogate tissue GDC-0449 dose exposure . - To make preliminary assessment tumor response patient treated drug . Tertiary - To examine modulation Hh target gene ( GLI1 ) GDC-0449 hair follicle and/or tumor tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral systemic Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 day 1 twice daily begin day 8 continue 49 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo plasma , urine , hair sample collection skin punch biopsy periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis . The plasma urine sample analyze separately use liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based method . Ex vivo plasma protein bind GDC-0449 assay use equilibrium dialysis approach . Expression level Gli1 Hedgehog target gene hair follicle sample and/or tumor tissue measure RNA level use qRT-PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow 21 day .</detailed_description>
