Subjects significant know medical condition T2DM . BMI ( body mass index ) within range 2535 kg/m2 , inclusive . T2DM diagnose least 3 month prior Screening Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) level ≤ 220mg/dL Screening visit , FPG level ≤ 250 mg/dL Day 1 Period 1 For subject take antidiabetic medication : HbA1c 7 10 % , inclusive , Screening visit For subject take metformin sulfonylurea : HbA1c 6.5 9.5 % , inclusive , Screening visit Subjects must take either antidiabetic medication , metformin monotherapy , sulfonylurea monotherapy . ( Subjects take BOTH metformin sulfonylurea qualify trial ) . If take metformin sulfonylurea , dose must stable least 3 month prior screen , subject must willing wash metformin sulfonylureas Day 7 prior Period 1 , discharge Period 4 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . As result medical interview , physical examination , screen investigation , Investigator considers subject unfit study .

Subject either immediate family member participate investigator , study coordinator , employee investigator ; member staff conduct study . Healthy Subjects As result medical interview , physical examination , screen investigation , Investigator considers subject unfit study . Has follow laboratory abnormality : Positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen , positive Hepatitis C , HIV result .

Fasting triglyceride &gt; 450mg/dL screen prior first dose . Total Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal screen prior first dose A positive prestudy drug/urine screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids benzodiazepine . A prestudy urine cotinine screen indicate use tobacco/ nicotine containing product . Significant renal disease loss kidney Significant ECG abnormality , Systolic pressure &gt; 150 mmHg &lt; 80 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg &lt; 60 mmHg screening . Blood pressure assessment may repeat need , allow adequate time subject rest . Previous use insulin treatment within 3 month Screening , &gt; 2 week use acute illness last 12 month prior Screening , use 1 year associate GDM . Has history follow condition : Clinically significant symptom gastroparesis Cholelithiasis obstructive inflammatory gallbladder disease within 3 month prior Screening Gastrointestinal disease could affect fat bile acid absorption , include inflammatory bowel disease , chronic diarrhea , Crohn 's malabsorption syndrome within past year Gastrointestinal surgery Chronic acute pancreatitis History regular alcohol consumption average &gt; 7 drinks/week woman &gt; 14 drinks/week men . 1 drink equivalent ( 12 g alcohol ) = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit ) within 6 month screen . Smoked used tobacco nicotinecontaining product within previous 6 month . Has participate clinical trial receive drug new chemical entity within 30 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose current study medication . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Is take prohibited medication : Acetaminophen may use needed adverse event ; however , use restrict 4 hour dose possible preferred maximum dose 2 gram 24 hour . The use antidiabetic agent metformin sulfonylureas reason exclusion subject allow wash unapproved antidiabetic medication order qualify participation study . Subjects take BOTH metformin sulfonylurea qualify trial . Subjects must wash follow medication 7day period prior first dose , must remain medication discharge period 4 : metformin , sulfonylurea , statin , fat absorption block agent , bile acid sequestrants All prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) prohibit within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication discharge Period 4 .
