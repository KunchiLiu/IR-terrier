	<brief_title>A Study Ispinesib Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase I dose-escalation portion trial determine Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Ispinesib ( SB-715992 ) monotherapy administer one-hour infusion Days 1 15 28-day cycle female patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer . The Phase II regimen evaluate MTD determine Phase I chemotherapy-naïve female patient measurable , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . Phase II ass overall response rate ( ORR ) derive individual patient assessment complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) base RECIST , determine independent review .</detailed_description>
