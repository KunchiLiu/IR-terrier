	<brief_summary>In study , want see feed affect breathe small premature baby . Using special feed tube stomach , measure diaphragm ( large breathe muscle ) might affect feed . We also want see slow feeding may lessen effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effects Feeding Feeding Methods Breathing Pattern Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature baby may pause breathe know apnea , may require invasive treatment . The exact cause apnea unknown , may relate combination brain , gut , lung immaturity . Research premature baby suggest feeding may affect lung function , effect may lessen feed give slow rate . Further research show diaphragm , important breathing muscle , may fatigue full stomach . We speculate , premature baby , feed might tire diaphragm , thus impair lung function possibly cause apnea . We plan study 10 stable premature baby less 23 week 1.25 kilogram birth . By insert special feed tube sensor stomach , measure electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) . By analyse EAdi feeding , want directly measure feed might affect lung function . We also want compare feed usual rate ( 5-15 minute ) versus slow rate ( 90 minute ) see effect lung function might differ . This important study help u determine appropriate treatment premature baby apnea relate feeding .</detailed_description>
