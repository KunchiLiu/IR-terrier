	<brief_summary>This research study test clinical procedure FDA approve medical device . This project screen 80 volunteer enroll 40 active subject receive single tooth implant anterior ( incisor/canine ) pre-molar tooth mandible maxilla ( implant place molar site ) . This 3 year research study examine clinical effect load regimen roughen surfaced implant . The propose research project measure change mucosal heal maturation three year period follow implant placement . The propose research lay foundation improve health care provide surgeon restorative dentist data determine relationship implant healing , load pattern bone type . The rationale underlies investigation identification influence time load implant stability vary bone type allow routine , predictable use early loading , , turn , translate rapid health care , improve psychosocial well-being patient . If hypothesis correct , result expect provide evidence base research data support early loading immediate loading single implant sit adequate bone volume , density . In addition , expect result fundamentally advance field implant dentistry bioengineering provide information principle bone density-mechanical environment-implant stability interaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Prospective Clinical Trial Comparing Single Tooth Implant 3 Loading Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIALS AND METHODS This longitudinal human clinical trial design prospective study , measure implant stability resonance frequency analyzer ( Osstell , Integration Diagnostics AB , Sweden ) time implant placement 16 week post placement . After 16 week , definitive implant abutment place final dental crown deliver . No follow-up do resonance frequency approach . However , subject follow 3 year post implant placement describe follow-up visit . The study population consist subject University Iowa 's College Dentistry . Subjects present one tooth miss anterior ( incisor/canine ) pre-molar region mandible maxilla exist teeth healthy adequately restore shall screen base inclusion/exclusion criterion . The miss tooth replace fix implant restoration one implant . SEQUENCE OF VISITS A . Visit 1 : Screening Examination Subjects shall see evaluation collection baseline data . Pre-treatment data shall record case report form . The visit shall include : 1 . Explanation patient purpose study plan procedure relate study . 2 . Explanation subject risk possible complication participation study . Patients shall notify inclusion study purpose provide implant treatment provision active treatment guarantee implied except care relate implant aspect oral cavity . This treatment shall agree upon outline specific case . Implant Site Selection : Adequate bone volume need accommodate plan endosseous dental implant . This mean sufficient height implant would encroach vital structure ( inferior alveolar nerve ) , sufficient width implant could place within confines exist bone without dehiscence fenestration , require significant grafting time implant placement . Typically , mean space dimension : 6 mm great ridge width facial-lingual &gt; 6 mm mesial distal dimension . If implant place screw thread expose , graft allow cover thread . In planned occlusal-gingival dimension , must least 7 mm space plan head implant plan occlusal plane . The subject notify inclusion study conditional upon satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion see Table 1 . Only subject satisfy Inclusion/Exclusion criterion shall enrol . The dental implant system use Astra Tech OsseoSpeed Dental Implant System ( Astra Tech AB , MÃ¶lndal Sweden ) . This FDA clear product FDA 510k clearance act ( FDA clearance 4/30/2004 ) . This protocol call use 4.0 mm diameter 11 mm long dental implant ( OsseoSpeed Aqua platform ; Ref Number 24622 ; Astra Tech AB ) anterior ( incisor/canine ) posterior pre-molar region mandible maxilla . All site must sound natural restored teeth/implants Mesial Distal plan site interest ( Bounded Edentulous Space BES ) . The patient otherwise restore stable occlusion mutually protect . No implant place molar site . The implant length accept study 11 mm . Clinical radiographic screening use limit study patient sufficient bone quantity completely encase implant . Upon review subject 's health history , inclusion/exclusion criterion screen clinical assessment make . Existing dental radiograph within past 6 month shall acceptable . No new radiograph make subject enrollment obtain sign informed consent . The subject give informed consent study review clinical study coordinator . Preliminary diagnostic impression make ( Penta , 3M ESPE ) pour dental stone ( Whip Mix Corp. , Louisville , KY ) . Implant subject may pre-operative Cone Bean CT image study ( Galileos ; Sirona , Charlotte NC ; www.sirona.com ) make College Dentistry 's Department Oral Maxillofacial Radiology discretion Principal Investigator follow diagnostic work-up . Subjects shall either patient record College Dentistry shall enrol new College . Patient record electronic ( WinDent ) along paper version . Paper-based Case Report Forms ( CRF ) contain subject 's medical information keep one central file lock cabinet Dental Clinical Research Center . This data keep secure file accessible PI Clinical Coordinator .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patient 18 year old . Ability understand sign inform consent prior start study . Ability willingness comply study requirement . Adequate oral hygiene ( defined average Modified Sulcus Bleeding Index 1 less average Modified Plaque Index 1 less ) . Must bound edentulous space . Adequate bone volume accommodate plan endosseous dental implant ( e.g . sufficient height implant would encroach vital structure inferior alveolar nerve , sufficient width implant could place within confines exist bone without dehiscence fenestration , require significant grafting time implant placement ) . The implant utilized protocol 4.0 mm diameter 11 mm long implant ( Fixture OsseoSpeed Astra Tech ) . Typically , mean space dimension : 6 mm great ridge width faciallingual &gt; 6 mm mesial distal dimension . If implant place screw thread expose , graft allow cover thread . In planned occlusalgingival dimension , must least 7 mm space plan head implant plan occlusal plane . Osteotome use allow must minimum 8mm bone height alveolar crest floor sinus . Maximum sinus lift 4 mm . Existing teeth healthy adequately restore , desire fix restoration implant . Patient mutually protect occlusion . The patient , childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test within one week prior surgery . Patients smoke cigarette chew tobacco within past year . History alcoholism drug abuse within past 5 year . Severe bruxing clench habit Untreated periodontitis Patients undue risk outpatient surgical procedure Presence residual root implant site Patients history site development ( extensive bone augmentation ) implant site past 4 month . Placement implant extraction site heal less 2 month . Presence local inflammation mucosal diseases lichen planus . Uncontrolled diabetes ( define HA1c &gt; 7.0 percent ) . Current hematologic disorder chronic use coumarin ( similar ) anticoagulant therapy . History leukocyte dysfunction deficiency Metabolic bone disorder History renal failure History liver disease Immunocompromised patient HIV , RA , SLE collagen vascular disorder . Chronic corticosteroid use . Current chemotherapy History use IVbased bisphosphonates . History radiation treatment head neck Patients require graft bone mucosal tissue time implant placement would require submersion implant healing period . Use investigational drug device within 30 day period immediately prior implant surgery Patients require submersion implant esthetic reason . Patient require ongoing dental treatment quadrant oppose quadrant initial 16 week healing period .</criteria>
