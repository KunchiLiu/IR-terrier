	<brief_summary>- Osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) secrete glycoprotein contain 401 amino acid . It member tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor superfamily . It firstly discover protein regulate bone metabolism , inhibit osteoclastogenesis , consequently , inhibit bone resorption - Evaluation OPG level disease marker also report . It show patient coronary artery disease high serum OPG level healthy volunteer . Moreover , serum OPG level correlate number stenotic coronary artery - OPG detect lung use Northern blot analysis - It likely OPG would contribute pathogenesis COPD could effective disease marker disease</brief_summary>
