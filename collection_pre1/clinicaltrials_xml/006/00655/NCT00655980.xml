	<brief_title>Vitamins Nitrous Oxide Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background significance : Recent study show nitrous oxide ( N2O ) anesthesia may associate increase risk adverse cardiovascular outcome . It well-known N2O inhibits vitamin B12-dependent enzyme result increase plasma homocysteine concentration . Homocysteine identify risk factor cardiovascular disease . Therefore elevation homocysteine N2O may causative factor N2O toxicity . In previous investigation , find patient carry homozygous mutation MTHFR gene develop high homocysteine level N2O anesthesia non-carriers . These patient might high risk adverse cardiac outcome N2O . Thus , may pharmacogenetic mechanism account adverse cardiac outcome N2O . Moreover , prevention N2O-increased homocysteine concentration high risk patient perioperative vitamin B12 folate supplementation might decrease incidence adverse cardiac outcome . Hypothesis : Patients carry homozygous MTHFR 677C &gt; T 1298 A &gt; C variant allele high incidence rate postoperative myocardial ischemia N2O anesthesia [ detect serial TnI measurement ] due elevate homocysteine level normal `` wild-type '' non-carriers , incidence rate reduce receive perioperative vitamin B12/folate supplementation . Primary outcome : Myocardial ischemia first 72 hour surgery ( measure serial troponin ECGs ) . Secondary outcome : Composite endpoint 30-day mortality major cardiac morbidity ( non-fatal MI ) Design : Randomized controlled trial . 500 patient receive N2O surgery randomize receive B-vitamins placebo . 125 patient receive N2O B-vitamins ( control arm ) . Mendelian randomization MTHFR genotype . Intervention : IV vitamin B12 ( 1 mg ) folate ( 5 mg ) pre- postoperatively Study set : Barnes-Jewish-Hospital , St. Louis , MO Patients : Patients schedule major surgery risk coronary artery disease</detailed_description>
