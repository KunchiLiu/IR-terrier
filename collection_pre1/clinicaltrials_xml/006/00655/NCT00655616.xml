	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient asthma carry genotype associate adverse outcome long-acting beta-2 agonist like salmeterol show great benefit use asthma drug work via alternative pathway like montelukast .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Add-on Salmeterol Versus Montelukast Arg/Arg-16 Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : The presence homozygous Arg/Arg genotype position 16 β2-receptor ( prevalence 15-17 % UK/US population ) confers relative protection down-regulation endogenous catecholamine , make individual susceptible down-regulation desensitization regular exogenous β2-agonists thereby negate benefit regular use short long act β2-agonists adult asthma . We find , child receive salmeterol , adjust odds ratio show 9 fold ( p=0.003 ) great risk school absence due asthma Arg/Arg group comparison Gly16 carrier , unadjusted odds ratio 6 ( p=0.009 ) . In cohort receive salmeterol , evidence genotype-dependent increase school absence due asthma ( odds ratio=1 ) . In addition , Arg/Arg child salmeterol significantly increase risk extend school absence 1 week asthma adjust odds ratio 6 ( p= 0.019 ) . Currently , British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommendation suggest use regular long-acting β2-agonists add therapy child asthma inadequately control inhaled steroid . The guideline suggest use leukotriene antagonist ( e.g . montelukast ) combination inhale salmeterol inhaled steroid fail control symptom . There 1 million child asthma UK . 150,000-170,000 child carry Arg/Arg-16 genotype . The Arg/Arg-16 child asthma may constitute significant population likely show good asthma control leukotriene antagonist comparison long-acting β2-agonists . We already demonstrate school absence constitute suitable primary outcome measure test hypothesis . Hypothesis : Children asthma carry Arg/Arg-16 genotype step 2 BTS guideline ( inhaled steroid plus salbutamol accord need ) few school absence period 1 year oral montelukast compare inhaled salmeterol Objectives : To perform randomize controlled trial ( parallel design ) oral montelukast versus inhale salmeterol child history school absences/hospital admission due asthma past year use school absence asthma period 1 year primary outcome Treatment Groups Duration : Inclusion/exclusion criteria- All child adolescent ( 5-18 year ) asthma Tayside ( Scotland ) know ( ) carry Arg/Arg-16 genotype ( b ) currently inhale steroid ( c ) inhale bronchodilator accord need telephone contact home visit establish ( ) school absence asthma ( b ) out-of-hours visit GP/hospital visit admission due asthma previous 12 month . The presence serious respiratory multi-system disease ( e.g . cystic fibrosis , cancer current treatment ) constitute exclusion criterion study . All patient fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion invite participate study . Plan visit - First visit : ( ) Documentation patient detail ( b ) Baseline spirometry ; ( c ) Exhaled nitric oxide measurement ( ) Respiratory quality-of-life ( Juniper ) ; ( e ) Saliva sample eosinophilic cationic protein ( f ) discontinuation current asthma medication period study ; ( g ) randomization receive either ( ) Flixotide ( fluticasone ) per current inhaled steroid dose ( therapeutic ratio 2:1 beclomethasone / budesonide versus fluticasone ) plus oral montelukast ; ( b ) Seretide ( salmeterol plus equivalent dose fluticasone ) plus placebo montelukast period 1 year . 2nd -5th visit , month 3 , 6 , 9 : 3-monthly spirometry , exhale nitric oxide , saliva eosinophilic cationic protein , document school absence asthma , hospital admissions/hospital out-of-hours GP visit 3-month period . Month 12 : end study - spirometry , exhale nitric oxide , saliva eosinophilic cationic protein , document school absence asthma , hospital admissions/hospital out-of-hours GP visit final 3-month period , measure quality-of-life . Physical monitoring compliance perform use inhaler provide counter tablet dispenser allow count number use . Doses dosage regimen : The following dos dosage regimen use study Seretide 100 Accuhaler 1 dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily placebo montelukast Seretide 250 Accuhaler 1 dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily placebo montelukast Seretide 500 Accuhaler 1 dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily placebo montelukast Flixotide Accuhaler 50 microgram per blister , 1 blister dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily montelukast Flixotide Accuhaler 100 microgram per blister ; 1 blister dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily montelukast Flixotide Accuhaler 250 microgram per blister ; 1 blister dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily montelukast Flixotide Accuhaler 500 microgram per blister ; 1 blister dose twice daily plus 1 tablet daily montelukast Doses montelukast placebo : upto 6 year 4 mg daily ; 6-14 year 5 mg daily ; 15 year 10 mg daily . Rescue medication : Subjects advise treatment inhale salbutamol 200 1000 microgram via meter dose inhaler volumatic device , cough , breathlessness , increase symptom exercise , symptom asthma occur . The dose advise repeat every four six hour . The regimen advise continued 3-4 day , week , case persistence symptom . The research nurse conduct study ensure subject adequate supply salbutamol via meter dose inhaler large volume spacer ( volumatic ) start study . This confirmed visit . Key Efficacy Parameters : 1 . Primary outcome : Oral montelukast associate reduced school absence comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year Arg/Arg-16 asthmatic child 2 . Secondary outcome also test : - Oral montelukast associate reduce out-of hour visits/hospital visit admission comparison inhaled salmeterol period 1 year - Oral montelukast associate reduction airway resistance comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year - Oral montelukast associate reduce exhaled nitric oxide level comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year - Oral montelukast associate reduce salivary eosinophilic cationic protein level comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year - Oral montelukast associate improved asthma specific quality-of-life comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year - Oral montelukast associate improved morning peak expiratory flow rate comparison inhale salmeterol period 1 year</detailed_description>
