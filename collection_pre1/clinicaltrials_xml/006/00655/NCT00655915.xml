	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether symptomatic improvement follow carpal tunnel corticosteroid injection correlate symptomatic improvement follow carpal tunnel release therefore serve prognostic indicator . Clinical question : Does response corticosteroid injection CTS predict outcomes surgical treatment ? Secondary Questions : 1 . Can confirm previous retrospectively collect data certain percentage conservatively manage patient steroid injection avoid surgery , patient undergo surgery good outcome . 2 . Are differences worker 's compensation non-worker 's compensation patient regard primary clinical question ? 3 . What Carpal Tunnel Release outcomes subset patient negative electrophysiologic study ? 4 . What outcomes patient undergo carpal tunnel release vs. choose undergo carpal tunnel release ? A prospective cohort design study appropriate study design order measure association predictor ( response injection ) outcome ( response surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Corticosteroid Injection Predictor Outcome Carpal Tunnel Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome painful condition cause compression median nerve wrist . Symptoms usually pain , weakness , numbness hand wrist , radiate arm . Corticosteroid injection utilize conservative management carpal tunnel syndrome several decade . They show relatively safe low report complication rate . Recent effort literature show efficacious majority patient although effect usually transient . Several study attempt show predictive value corticosteroid injection regard ultimately benefit carpal tunnel release . There trend towards positive predictability several retrospective study show patient clinical benefit steroid injection likely successful outcome carpal tunnel release . Carpal tunnel release remain definitive treatment option carpal tunnel syndrome , clinical test could give practitioner patient additional information regard likelihood successful outcome surgery would valuable prognostic tool .</detailed_description>
