	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving panitumumab together irinotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II clinical trial study give panitumumab together irinotecan see well work third-line therapy treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab Irinotecan Third-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess objective response rate panitumumab administer combination irinotecan hydrochloride third-line therapy patient advance metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutation ( wild type ) previously treat FOLFOX XELOX chemotherapy without bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride alone FOLFIRI CAPIRI chemotherapy without bevacizumab . Secondary - To assess efficacy term disease control rate , duration response , time response , progression-free survival , time progression , time treatment failure , duration stable disease . - To assess efficacy safety regimen , follow panitumumab alone patient discontinue third-line irinotecan hydrochloride due toxicity . Tertiary - To correlate regimen EGFR expression , detection functional genetic polymorphism EGFR gene , EGFR gene amplification ( FISH ) , EGFR activation detection , EGFR downstream protein gene expression parameter , proteomics , epigenetics . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive panitumumab IV 30-90 minute irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 . Patients discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride may receive panitumumab monotherapy . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue specimen obtain baseline correlative laboratory study . Tissue sample analyze EGFR amplification status chromogenic situ hybridization fluorescence situ hybridization , KRAS KRAF mutation , STAT3 expression . After completion study therapy , patient follow approximately 56 day .</detailed_description>
