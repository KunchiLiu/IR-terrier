	<brief_summary>This study do determine overall progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient advanced metastatic ( Stage IIIB - pleural effusion/IV ) , non-squamous histology NSCLC treat metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin . Also , currently define marker predict clinical benefit Avastin . Preliminary study show several observation support concept metronomic chemotherapy without combination anti-angiogenic agent . The metronomic chemotherapy Avastin show enhance clinical endpoint study ( response rate progressive-free survival ) . Proof metronomic scheduling require development appropriate intermediate surrogate marker . Several marker assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open-label , pilot Phase II study metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin chemo naïve subject advance non-squamous , non-small cell carcinoma lung . The primary endpoint study ass overall progression-free survival . Subjects treat metronomic chemotherapy paclitaxel gemcitabine weekly 3 4 week , Avastin administer every 2 week . Treatment metronomic chemotherapy express 4-week cycle . Tumor response treatment evaluate every 8 week . Treatment metronomic chemotherapy Avastin continue total 6 cycle unless evidence disease progression , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Maintenance therapy Avastin continue disease progression , intolerable toxicity withdrawal consent . Potential biologic parameter monitor anti-tumor activity metronomic chemotherapy evaluate 10 subject . These biomarkers include : sequential determination blood level VEGF , VEGFR2 , thrombospondin-1 , E-selectin , ICAM-1 , circulate endothelial cell endothelial precursor cell .</detailed_description>
