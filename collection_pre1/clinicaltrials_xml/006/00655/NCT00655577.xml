	<brief_summary>The significance population-based study produce new information planning intervention rehabilitation program elderly , plan education health care personnel plan national health education program different age group . The study consist epidemiological cross-sectional study randomize control intervention study . The study population consist 1689 home-dwelling woman bear 1924-1927 residing Oulu , Northern Finland , ask screening visit include bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurement distal radius 1997 . 1222 woman attend clinic afterwards mail postal questionnaire focusing lifelong risk factor osteoporosis , e.g . amount physical activity work leisure time , daily intake calcium use alcohol cigarette . Those BMD value 20 % low reference value , underwent densitometry hip . All woman femoral neck BMD 20 % reference value ( n=160 ) randomly select either exercise ( n=84 ) control ( n=76 ) group . At baseline annually 30-month intervention , balance , muscle strength , aerobic capacity , walk speed , cognitive function mood measure participant . Hip BMD measure annually . The exercise group participate supervised train program weekly session begin October end April . In addition supervise session participant train daily home . From April October exercise perform purely home . The training regimen consist balance , strength impact exercise . The intervention group keep diary daily physical activity . The number severity fall record group . The purpose study : 1. identify factor account low BMD elderly home-dwelling woman severe osteopenia . 2. evaluate supervise regular weight-bearing exercise program affect BMD elderly home-dwelling woman severe osteopenia 3. evaluate supervise regular balance muscle training affect balance muscle strength elderly home-dwelling woman severe osteopenia . In addition aim : 4. study regular supervise exercise affect incidence severity fall , mood cognitive function woman severe osteopenia . Hypothesis research methods The main hypothesis long-term supervise , mainly home- base regular impact-type balance muscle exercise improve balance muscle strength low extremity maintain bone mass elderly woman . We also hypothesize incidence fall lower exercise group control fall injurious control group intervention group follow-up period</brief_summary>
