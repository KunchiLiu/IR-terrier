	<brief_title>Fluvoxamine Sertraline Childhood Autism - Does SSRI Therapy Improve Behaviour and/or Mood ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism neuropsychiatric disorder diagnose early childhood . Approximately 10 Canadian child per 10 000 live birth suffer disorder , three four time common male female . It characterize social communicative deficit restrict , repetitive interest behaviours .

Three-quarters autistic child mild severe mental retardation quarter develop seizure later childhood adolescence . Its etiology heterogenous cure . Although behaviour therapy important tool management , pharmacotherapy remain necessity many child . Current therapy limit antipsychotic drug carry unacceptable risk chronic neurotoxicity ( tardive dyskinesia ) tricyclic antidepressant undesireble cardiovascular effect . This study propose evaluate potential benefit selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) autism . All autistic child whose symptom currently well control offer entry trial . Each child randomize eight week fluvooxamine , sertraline , placebo . If improve initial dose , may dose increase continue study eight week . Due significant amount within- between- patient variability , multiple baseline evaluation complete prior initiation drug therapy . Parents may choose continue therapy effective child ; child randomize placebo , parent may choose try SSRI period 8 week assess effectiveness .</detailed_description>
