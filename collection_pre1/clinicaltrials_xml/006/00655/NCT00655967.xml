	<brief_summary>Alcohol abuse dependence prevalent result significant morbidity , mortality cost society ( Harwood 2000 ) . Pharmacotherapies assist alcohol dependence consist disulfiram , naltrexone acamprosate . Of , acamprosate unique metabolize liver , rather completely excrete renally . In contrast , naltrexone metabolize CYP450 system liver less 2 % excrete unchanged cause liver damage ( PDR 2005 ) . Multiple case hepatitis , include cholestatic fulminant hepatitis , well hepatic failure result transplantation death , report administration disulfiram ( PDR 2005 ) . The incidence liver disease among alcoholic high increase age year drink may preclude use antabuse naltrexone help alcohol dependent patient liver disease elderly . Thus acamprosate unique safety profile would make ideally suit treat alcohol dependence elderly , even presence hepatic impairment . The current study evaluate safety profile acamprosate elderly patient alcohol dependence . Acamprosate , calcium acetyl homotaurinate , approve European country U.S. maintenance abstinence recently detoxify alcoholic . The mechanism action involve primarily restoration normal N-methyl- D -aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor tone glutamatergic system ( Rammes et al 2001 ) . Several trial acamprosate confirm efficacy maintenance abstinence alcohol dependence ( Lesch et al . 2001 ; Slattery et al . 2003 ; Mann et al . 2004 ; Verheul et al . 2004 ) . It also reduce severity relapse alcoholic abstinence base treatment program ( Chick et al . 2003 ) . There limited data safety acamprosate elderly ( PDR 2005 ) . For purpose study , elderly define 60 year old . STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine short-term safety Acamprosate treatment alcohol dependence elderly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Acamprosate Alcohol Dependence Elderly : An Open-Label Study ( SAFADIE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This trial conduct open-label , fix dose design safety Acamprosate elderly . Subjects receive Acamprosate 12 week . The schedule visit include screen , baseline three monthly follow-up visit day 30 , 60 90 . We recruit 25 subject total study period 15 month . Regarding number subject , chi-squared analysis total number side effect ( 61 % , i.e . 1230 2018 subject prior study ) possible number subject study side effect ( 0 25 ) , indicate significant ( alpha=0.05 ) difference previously observe rate would occur less 11 ( p &lt; =0.05 ) 20 ( p &lt; =0.025 ) subject report side effect . Side effect 11 20 subject would nonsignificantly different previously publish rate . Thus 25 subject sufficient detect significant deviation frequency overall side effect sample compare subject prior study . Total number side effect use calculation single common significant side effect would lend appropriate surrogate side effect overall . During course study subject supply 333mg tablet Acamprosate provide Sponsor . The study medication administer dose 666mg ( =two tablet ) three time day subject creatinine clearance &gt; 50 . The dose 333mg three time day subject creatinine clearance range 30-50 . Safety monitor subject 's report adverse event treatment visit throughout , open label double blind phase Trial . The report adverse event new symptom subject review summarize . This may also include clinically significant change vital sign ( blood pressure pulse reading , weight , temperature ) , physical examination , laboratory evaluation ( blood chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , EKG ) record concomitant treatment . A DSMB plan set . Treatment compliance monitor count return medication , subject counsel adhere , think risk adhere medication regimen .</detailed_description>
