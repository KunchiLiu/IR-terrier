	<brief_title>Effects Antidepressant Therapy Brain Dopamine Transporter Activity People With Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression serious psychiatric disorder affect 10 % adult population United States give year . Common symptoms depression include persistent mood disinterest previously enjoy activity , often cause strain work , social , family life . A person 's depression attribute variety cause , include physiological sociological factor . Among physiological factor , dopamine ( DA ) , chemical associate feeling happiness pleasure , may play key role onset depression may also involve beneficial effect antidepressant medication . Recent study find people depression increase DA transporter ( DAT ) level specific region inner brain call striatum . The increase DAT level might reflect alteration central DA function . Treatment depression selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant therapy may help return DAT level normal improve depressive symptom . Using single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) imaging , study examine change brain DAT activity people depression receive SSRI antidepressant therapy cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Participation study last 14 week involve participant healthy depress . All participant first undergo baseline assessment include medical history , question current past health , physical exam , blood draw , urine sampling , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . After complete baseline assessment , participant undergo TRODAT-1 SPECT scan , involve injection TRODAT-1 ( radioactive agent measure DA ) , 3-hour break , 75-minute SPECT scan . If necessary , participant may also ask magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan complete SPECT scan . Participants depression assign randomly undergo 12 week treatment either antidepressant medication s-citalopram CBT . Participants assign take s-citalopram return study visit weekly 2 week , every week 6 week , monthly 4 week . During study visit , participant receive medication , answer question depression medication side effect , occasionally fill general health questionnaire . Participants receive CBT attend twice weekly session 2 week weekly session 10 week . Sessions focus modify thought behavior may contribute depression . After 12 week , participant re-evaluated study doctor , still good health , undergo repeat TRODAT-1 SPECT scan .</detailed_description>
