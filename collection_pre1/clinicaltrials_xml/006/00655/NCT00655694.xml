	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic disease characterize progressive airflow obstruction , chronic cough dyspnoea advance stage . Techniques genomics , proteomics metabonomics , Technologies aim identify quantify dynamic set small molecule metabolite present organism biological sample , offer prospect efficiently distinguish individual particular disease . The advantage proteomics metabonomics carry standard preparation serum , plasma urine , circumvent need specialist preparation cellular mRNA require genomics This methodology base mass spectrometry ( MS ) , gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) analyze metabolite . High-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) may also apply . Several peak alignment algorithm develop match chromatogram apply pattern recognition . Based pattern recognition , several potential biomarkers may find identify MS.. Finally , number potential biomarkers identify distinguish asthma COPD . We hope develop well understand lung disease . Information study use research purpose , help develop safer effective treatment asthma COPD .</brief_summary>
