	<detailed_description>This protocol design screen potential research participant either diagnose undiagnosed ocular condition . Participants without evidence ocular condition also screen use protocol . This protocol serve point entry individual may eligible wish participate National Eye Institute ( NEI ) clinical research study . Participants carefully evaluate screen process determine whether suitable candidate inclusion ongoing NEI research study . The screening process include past current medical history , appropriate , physical examination . Other routine diagnostic procedure test may also conduct order help determine participant eligibility . These test procedure minimal risk associate . Once screening process complete eligibility determine , participant inform option participate one NEI current clinical research protocol . If suitable research protocol participation identify , recommendation treatment option may give individual , primary provider refer physician .</detailed_description>
