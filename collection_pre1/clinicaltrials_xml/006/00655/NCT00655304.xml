	<brief_title>The Effect Prometheus ( R ) Liver Support Dialysis Cerebral Metabolism Acute Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute liver failure ( ALF ) highly mortal medical condition often complicate multiorgan failure . Apart severe coagulopathy ALF characterize onset hepatic encephalopathy many case intracranial hypertension ( ICH ) risk cerebral incarceration . The pathogenesis behind ICH incompletely understand therapeutic option limit . Prometheus ( R ) liver support dialysis offer system apart regular high-flux hemodialysis certain extent able remove albumin-bound substance patient - feature theoretically could benefit patient ALF . In study intend investigate effect 6-8 hour Prometheus ( R ) liver support dialysis cerebral metabolism , ICH cerebral bloodflow ( CBF ) patient ALF . The study design open , prospective randomize study , control-group treat 6-8 hour continuously veno-venous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) standard medical treatment ( SMT ) compare intervention group treat Prometheus ( R ) liver support dialysis SMT . The study design cross-over study include patient treat group randomize order . The primary end-points treatment effect intracranial pressure , CBF cerebral oxidative metabolism ( lactate/pyruvate-ratio ) . We use intracranial monitoring system Integra/Camino ( R ) ( United States ) combination CMA microdialysis system bedside analyzer ( CMA-600 ) ( Stockholm , Sweden ) .</detailed_description>
