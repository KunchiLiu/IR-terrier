	<brief_summary>This research project compare two method correct refractive error ( long short-sightedness ) spectacle lens . The primary outcome proportion population require spectacle correction 's need meet scheme . Secondary outcome cost effectiveness schemes development guideline identification amongst population suitable 'ready-made ' spectacle . There two site involve research . Those uncorrected refractive error identify distance vision . Those impaired vision ( least 20/40 ) improve spectacle invite participate research . Participants randomly allocate one two group . The first group receive spectacles full correction eye second group receive spectacle limited inventory . The two scheme compare many people continue use spectacle , vision new spectacle , change level visual functioning quality life wear new spectacle one month . At one month visit , spectacle provide useful , one new pair custom spectacle dispense .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effectiveness Correcting Refractive Error With Ready-made Spectacles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In India , participant recruit attend Shroff 's Charity Eye Hospital refractive eye care . These individual screen eye disease visual acuity measure part routine care . All distance vision worse 20/40 pinhole acuity take estimate benefit refractive correction . Those refracted distance visual acuity well 20/40 good eye minimum spherical refractive error Â±1 dioptre eligible study . The clinical testing conduct day include habitual distance vision , refraction refract visual acuity . In China , participant recruit identified School Screening Program place GuangZhou ( Childsight ) . In program , teacher measure visual acuity . Those 20/40 bad distance vision invite parent information night . At time , information provide study interested participate sign record inform assent parental permission . The clinical testing conduct later visit optometrist attend school . Study questionnaires administer clinical test vision include habitual distance vision , refraction refract visual acuity . The duration study 2 month require total three visit . After initial visit , dispense visit arrange base time supply spectacles final visit plan 1 month receipt spectacle . This study mask . The person interview patient quality life test vision visit know intervention status subject .</detailed_description>
