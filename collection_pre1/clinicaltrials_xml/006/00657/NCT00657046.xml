	<brief_summary>In clinical trial Japan , droxidopa show effective affect blood pressure change upon orthostatic challenge patient autonomic dysfunction , well reduce severity frequency symptom orthostatic hypotension patient . The efficacy droxidopa ameliorate symptom patient undergoing dialysis also demonstrate literature clinical trial conduct Japan . The current study investigate clinical efficacy two different dos droxidopa patient intradialytic hypotension 4 week treatment period placebo control . The clinical efficacy evaluate change hypotension- related symptom , well change blood pressure prior , follow , HD session compare pre-treatment baseline value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Benefit Study Droxidopa Treat Patients With Intradialytic Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety droxidopa HD patient intradialytic hypotension . The study conduct 15 center , sufficient number patient enrol allow 75 patient randomize 3 study group ( 25 randomize placebo , 25 randomize 400 mg droxidopa , 25 randomize 600 mg droxidopa ) . The study consist initial screening period ( 7 day ) confirm eligibility follow 2 week baseline , 4 week treatment period . During baseline treatment visit SBP DBP measurement collect use consistent method immediately pre- , immediately post-dialysis . SBP , DBP heart rate measurement take every 20 minute HD session . There 19 schedule visit , include post-treatment follow-up visit , trial ; Visit 1 ( Screening ) , Visits 2 7 ( baseline randomization ) , Visits 8 19 ( tri-weekly treatment visit ) . Each visit coincide patient 's normal dialysis treatment . All patient follow 30 day follow completion active treatment period ( premature withdrawal ) check occurrence adverse event ( AEs ) . Patients attend study center out-patients . Eligible patient assign unique identification number screening , prior first treatment visit randomize one follow treatment group : Group A : Droxidopa 400 mg ( 2 capsule contain 200 mg droxidopa plus one capsule mannitol substitute droxidopa ) Group B : Droxidopa 600 mg ( 3 capsule contain 200 mg droxidopa ) Group C : Placebo ( 3 capsule mannitol substitute droxidopa ) Each patient take 3 capsule 1 hour prior dialysis procedure approximately 100 mL ( typically half glass ) water . The primary measure efficacy change baseline ( visits 2-7 ) average mean arterial blood pressure compare treatment ( visit 14-19 ) . The secondary measure efficacy : - Change baseline ( visits 2-7 ) treatment ( visits 14-19 ) average mean nadir systolic diastolic blood pressure hemodialysis ; - Change number hypotension-induced intervention hemodialysis ( HD ) session ; - Change hypotension-induced symptom measure hemodialysis ; - Change daily symptom associated hemodialysis ; - Change fatigue use Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI-20 ) . The safety droxidopa evaluate base occurrence treatment-emergent adverse event ( AE ) specific evaluation blood pressure , heart rate ( HR ) , ECG , laboratory finding across study .</detailed_description>
