	<brief_title>Ranolazine Versus Placebo Effects Exercise Tolerance Patients With Heart Disease Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Endpoints : Primary Endpoint : • The primary endpoint study change kinetics tissue hemoglobin oxygen desaturation ( expressed time constant ) follow onset exercise . Secondary endpoint study include percent absolute change : - Peak oxygen consumption - Pulmonary oxygen uptake on-kinetics - Steady state level tissue hemoglobin desaturation exercise - Recovery kinetics tissue oxygen saturation follow exercise Adverse event collect . Exploratory Endpoints - Peak Walking Time ( PWT ) - Claudication Onset Time ( COT ) - Time Onset Angina ( TOA ) Study Design : Investigator-initiated , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Males age &gt; 40 year . 2 . Subjects must chronic stable angina , meeting label indication ranolazine : • Ranolazine indicate treatment chronic angina . Ranolazine reserve subject achieve adequate response anti-anginal drug . 3 . Subjects must rest ankle brachial index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.90 post-exercise decrement ≥ 10 % least one leg , OR rest ABI ≥0.90 ≤ 1.00 post-exercise decrement ≥ 20 % least one leg 4 . The subject provide write informed consent participate , understand requirement study , agree return required assessment Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Non-atherosclerotic disease peripheral circulation clinical history 2 . Unable complete first stage modify , extend Astrand treadmill protocol 3 . Clinically significant ECG abnormality change exercise screen ECG 4 . Evidence critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) 5 . Hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh Classes A [ mild ] , B [ moderate ] , C [ severe ] ) 6 . End stage renal disease require dialysis 7 . Hemoglobin &lt; 12 mg/dL . 8 . Platelet count &lt; 90,000/mL . 9 . Planned surgical/endovascular intervention coronary artery disease ( CAD ) peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) next 3 month 10 . Maximal exercise limit symptom claudication angina 11 . Significant mental illness drug abuse within 30 day enrollment opinion Investigator could impact subject 's ability successfully complete trial 12 . Known allergy ranolazine 13 . Pre-existing QTc prolongation rest electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Screening due risk worsen condition use ranolazine 14 . Treatment QT prolong drug Class IA ( e.g . quinidine ) Class III ( e.g . sotalol , dofetilide ) , antiarrhythmic , amiodarone , antipsychotic ( e.g . thioridazine , ziprasidone ) 15 . Treatment potent moderately potent CYP3A inhibitor include ketoconazole azole antifungal , diltiazem , verapamil , macrolide antibiotic , cyclosporine , rifampin structurally related rifabutin rifapentin , phenobarbital , phenytoin , carbamazepine , St. John 's Wort , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) protease inhibitor 16 . The subject previously receive ranolazine within 6-months prior enrollment 17 . The subject receive investigational drug within 90 day prior enrollment 18 . Type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus 19 . Congestive Heart Failure , ≥ New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III 20 . History oxygen dependent Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) 21 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 35</detailed_description>
