	<brief_summary>The mechanism responsible development hormonal refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) elusive . Genetic inactivation/loss PTEN tumor suppressor gene occur 30-60 % advanced prostate cancer 20 % localized form . Researchers hypothesize PTEN loss landmark genetic event prostate cancer progression fatal HRPC form . One consequence PTEN loss activation oncogenic Akt phosphorylation downstream Akt target include mTOR . mTOR control many important cellular process include cell cycle regulation . We propose evaluate pharmacodynamic assessment mTOR inhibitor RAD001 intermediate high risk prostate cancer patient neoadjuvant set . Patients admit 6 week treatment RAD001 10 mg/day follow either radical prostatectomy radiotherapy combine hormonal treatment . Immunohistochemistry antibody phosphorylated p70S6K , pS6 , Akt well antibodies VEGF , BCL2 PTEN prostate cancer tissue 6 week RAD001 treatment perform . Additionally , Patients evaluate FDG-PET scan ( baseline ) RAD001 treatment . A link mTOR signal glycolysis regulation establish may provide mechanism ass drug-target interaction RAD001 prostate cancer . The secondary endpoint trial determine response proportion RAD001 treatment assess time biochemical failure follow radiation therapy radical prostatectomy . The data compare matched cohort high intermediate-risk prostate cancer patient admit treatment modality without receive RAD001 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study RAD001 Neoadjuvant Setting Men With Intermediate High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newly diagnose patient prostate cancer , localize untreated disease must intermediate high risk disease relapse base PSA , Gleason score , clinical stage . Before start treatment , baseline radiographic evaluation FDG-PET magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform . Biopsies also perform obtain fresh tissue molecular gene expression assay . In patient positive FDG-PET scan baseline , Treatment Day 1-14 RAD001 10 mg/day alone . After perform post-RAD001 FDG-PET evaluation , treatment Day 15 equivalent Treatment Day 1 trial patient negative FDG-PET scan baseline . In patient negative FDG-PET scan baseline , Treatment Day 1 begin Phase II trial RAD001 combine androgen ablation treatment . Patients treat RAD001 10 mg per day combine androgen ablation therapy 8 week depend ability tolerate drug . Radiographic biologic assay repeat 8 week , time patient undergo prostatectomy external beam radiation therapy ( ERT ) . Second biopsy perform patient admit ERT They receive RAD001 day surgery ERT ascertain good tissue concentration drug . Gene expression profile also evaluate time . The primary endpoint study pharmacodynamic assessment effect RAD001 prostate cancer . However , secondary endpoint study define true success . Specifically , study evaluate pharmacodynamic assessment effect RAD001 prostate cancer use novel application radiology , molecular biology , genomics . These novel endpoint correlate establish pathologic measure , microvessel density , apoptotic index , PTEN , phospho-AKT phospho-p70S6K . MRI 3-dimensional . PSA effect also assess . Prostate cancer tissue high risk prostate cancer patient admit neoadjuvant androgen ablation without RAD001 serve control . An ambitious aspect project examine gene expression alteration occur patient . It technically challenge get enough tissue needle biopsy gene array analysis . However , clearly , obtain information might useful describe full effect RAD001 therapy patient population .</detailed_description>
