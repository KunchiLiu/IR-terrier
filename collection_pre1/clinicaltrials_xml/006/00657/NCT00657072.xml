	<brief_summary>Damage ligament wrist occur frequently , however , well publicize understood . Our previous current biomechanical study show damage certain wrist ligament likely cause wrist instability pain . Based three dimensional model animation actual cadaver motion various ligament intact section , identify several change carpal bone move position relative radius various level instability . Using information , develop mathematical model predict cadaver wrists group ligament injure . We start , IRB approval , prospective clinical study evaluate reliability mathematical model . During past 5 year study 13 patient suspected wrist ligament injury previously schedule surgical treatment . CT scan perform injured wrist comparison purpose , contralateral , uninjured wrist . During 5 year , problem conduct study . During 5 year change original study application - ) include CT scan contralateral wrist comparison purpose - b ) paper handout give potential subject - c ) add additional people study team . The principal investigator , blind result CT scan , surgically explore treats patient manner would patient suspected wrist ligament injury . During surgery , investigator determines integrity various wrist ligament . The prediction ligament damage , base upon CT scan information mathematical model compare actual surgical finding . The importance study develop tool allow one rapidly non invasively diagnose wrist instability initiate treatment damage do .</brief_summary>
