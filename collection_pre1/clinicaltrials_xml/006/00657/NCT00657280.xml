	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect sitagliptin , medicine commonly use treat type 2 diabetes , utilization glucose heart patient heart failure due heart attack . We hope determine whether improve heart 's ability use glucose blood may help improve function heart well . If , may suggest even people frank diabetes heart failure may benefit use medication . This study also investigate effect sitagliptin body 's use sugar , effect sitagliptin blood flow heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effect Sitagliptin Glucose ( Sugar ) Metabolism Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening : Patients screen base exist clinic information regard NYHA class ( New York Heart Association functional class ) heart failure characteristic . Patients approach clinic complete clinical care visit regard participation trial . If patient agrees participate , informed consent obtain time . At enrollment : Patients query whether undergone previous nuclear medicine scan previous year order ensure exceed current standard total annual radiation exposure . Undergo baseline combine 18-FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) PET/13N-NH3 PET/CT ass heart 's ability utilize blood sugar coronary blood flow . This take approximately 3-4 hour . This nuclear medicine procedure commonly use assess myocardial viability well global heart function . It involve injection radioisotope-labeled tracer ( 18-FDG 13N-NH3 ) intravenously follow measurement myocardial uptake use tomographic scanner . Venous blood sample perform 75g oral glucose load 18-FDG portion assist quantitation myocardial glucose uptake measurement insulin sensitivity . Perfusion ( 13N-NH3 ) image repeat infusion adenosine 0.14 mg/kg/min order ass coronary flow reserve . A computed tomography scan perform time baseline PET scan attenuation correction . Blood draw measure change fast insulin , blood sugar , lipid profile , ADMA level . Approximately 45 cc 3 tablespoon blood drawn save possible future analysis . 18-FDG/13N-NH3 PET scan routinely perform patient ischemic heart disease . While study use standard protocol examination , currently part standard care nonischemic heart failure . However , important test hypothesis study . 3 ) Begin sitagliptin 100 mg daily four week . If calculate creatinine clearance 30-49 cc/min Cockcroft-Gault formula , sitagliptin dose reduce 50 mg daily four week per manufacturer guideline . There placebo arm . This open-label study . Patients advise regard potential side effect prompt notification study personnel . They instruct contact investigator concern evidence adverse effect . 4 ) At four week : Repeat FDG/NH3 PET compare pretreatment scan . This take approximately 3-4 hour . Blood draw measure change fast insulin , blood sugar , lipid profile , ADMA ( asymmetrical dimethylarginine ) level . Approximately 45 cc 3 tablespoon blood drawn save possible future analysis .</detailed_description>
