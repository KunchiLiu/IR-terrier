	<detailed_description>Leishmaniasis protozoal disease transmit sandfly endemic many part world include Central South America , Europe , Southwest Asia , Africa , Middle East . Infected human may develop cutaneous ( Old New World ) , mucocutaneous ( New World ) , visceral leishmaniasis . The disease medical threat military soldier assign endemic area currently major cause morbidity soldier deploy Middle East complication military exercise Panama , Honduras , South America . Sodium stibogluconate ( SSG ) Investigational New Drug ( IND ) product use Department Defense ( DoD ) 20 year treatment cutaneous , mucosal visceral leishmaniasis . The primary objective protocol treat laboratory-confirmed leishmaniasis SSG 20mg/kg/d intravenously ( IV ) 10 day 20 day ; visceral leishmaniasis treat SSG 20mg/kg/d IV 28 day second line therapy fail intolerant Ambisome ; mucosal leishmaniasis treat SSG 20mg/kg/d IV 28 day . Subjects monitor daily outcome measure end therapy degree heal cutaneous lesion resolution laboratory abnormality symptoms case mucosal visceral leishmaniasis . Pentavalent antimonials ( Pentostam , Glaxo Smith Kline , United Kingdom ) use treat leishmaniasis 50 year . This drug license commercial use United States , likely limited commercial marketability . Worldwide within DoD , great deal experience use Pentostam treatment leishmaniasis . SSG pentavalent antimony ( Sb ) complexed carbohydrate whose exact structure mechanism action know . It provide 100 mg antimony/mL solution contains preservative , m-chlorocresol . The kidney excrete dose within 24 hour . In 1984 , World Health Organization recommend daily dose antimony treatment visceral leishmaniasis increase 20 mg/kg/day . A randomized control trial 40 subject American , New World , cutaneous leishmaniasis ( ACL ) find 100 % cure rate 20 mg/kg/day Sb 20 day 76 % cure 10 mg/kg/day 10 day use . A comparison three treatment schedule 36 subject CL ( single rapid infusion , continuous 24 hour infusion , every eight hour dos ) find advantage use daily dosing . A review control trial SSG conclude recommended course therapy 20 mg/kg/day upper limit dose 20 day CL 20 mg/kg/day 28 day visceral mucocutaneous leishmaniasis . The Pentostam® package insert suggest 10-20 mg/kg/day maximum dose 850 mg minimum 20 day use ; however , base Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) experience practice guideline , 20 mg/kg/day upper limit dosage use . In protocol upper limit dose . WRAMC recently publish CL treatment experience primarily New World leishmaniasis compare SSG 20 mg/kg 10 20 day find 100 % volunteer 10-day group cure . In study 15 % Leishmania major infection . Comparable result expect Old World leishmaniasis base clinical experience current literature . Detailed toxicity data 20 mg/kg/day dose provide several study . Percentages WRAMC experience include . Subjective musculoskeletal complaint common ( 58 % ) , well elevate hepatocellular ( 67 % ) pancreatic enzyme level ( 97 % ) nonspecific electrocardiogram ( EKG ) change ( T wave change ) . These side effect usually reversible , death associate SSG WRAMC . Other SSG toxic effect include headache ( 22 % ) , rash ( 9 % ) , thrombocytopenia , depression various hematologic cell line ( 44 % ) , phlebitis , anaphylaxis , inflammation around lesion , transient cough infusion . Other associate symptom include anorexia , malaise , myalgia , abdominal pain , headache , lethargy , sweat , vertigo , facial flushing , initial worsen skin lesion , epistaxis , jaundice peripheral neuropathy . In above-mentioned 10 versus 20 day study , adverse event ( AE ) significantly decrease cohort receive 10 day versus 20 myalgia 42 % ( versus 68 % ) , less chemical pancreatitis few hematologic parameter disorder . Angioedema SSG infusion recently describe two subject WRAMC . Both subject respond quickly benadryl treatment without complication . Both subject subsequently skin test SSG intradermally hypersensitivity one react . Alternative heat therapy use successfully treat CL . Laboratory investigation show Leishmania infection sensitive heat . Various form heat application human CL show variable efficacy . The TTI Thermomed™ device currently U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , section 510-K clear use treatment CL . This device use localized current field radio frequency . Other therapy may effective treat CL include topical paromomycin oral fluconazole .</detailed_description>
