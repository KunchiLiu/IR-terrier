	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veterans Healthcare : Our ultimate goal improve health veteran design intervention clinical microsystem level facilitate integration KM-SD roles primary care improve relationship learn . We anticipate cross-cutting intervention potential improve clinical performance well staff patient satisfaction . If successful , could breakthrough efficiency VA organizational change . Project Background : The way conceptualize basic nature primary care clinic ( PCC ) greatly influence beliefs idea work improve operation . If view production line , design improvement effort use system engineering technique aim standardizing , reduce variation , improve efficiency . If instead view PCC organic complex social system , might design improvement effort use method design embrace rather eliminate surprise ( inevitable health care setting ) , enhance connection communication individual PCC rather focus improve skill set individual , use feedback time reflection part strategy PCC make sense operation behavior relation mission goal . For purpose proposal , latter approach denote term knowledge management technique . We propose study whether PCC performance correlate presence high level use knowledge management technique within PCCs . The VA forefront implement knowledge management practice , sue performance data system integrate health record , yet pay sufficient attention relationship management , increase diversity decision making , active learning , sense-making . Project Objectives : Describe range knowledge management technique , include relationship management active learning ) currently employ 15 VA 5 VA contract PCCs . 2 . Analyze relationship nature roles relationship learn PCCs performance across multiple outcome include clinical performance measure , worker satisfaction turnover , patient satisfaction . Our research proposition : ( 1 ) High perform PCCs exhibit high quality relationship active learn low perform clinic ; ( 2 ) The quality relationship within PCCs large effect worker patient satisfaction . Research Propositions : 1 . High perform VA VA contract primary care clinic exhibit high quality relationship active learn low perform clinic . 2.a . Variation temporal change relationship learn among 20 clinic 30 month observe . 2.b . The temporal change relationship ( stable , improve deteriorate adjacent year ) associate similar temporal change patient employee satisfaction.2 c. The temporal change learning ( stable , improve deteriorate adjacent year ) associate similar temporal change process care quality indicator intermediate clinical outcome . Project Methods : Descriptive , iterative study 15 VA 5 VA contract primary care clinic within VISN 17 . Using ethnographic , qualitative quantitative data collection method , clinic profile nature relationship staff staff patient nature learn . Clinical outcome ( patient functional status , BP , cholesterol , HgA1c , preventable admission ) , patient satisfaction , employee satisfaction turnover serve outcome . The association outcomes nature relationship learn explore qualitatively quantitatively . Stability profile evaluate two subsequent wave data collection .</detailed_description>
