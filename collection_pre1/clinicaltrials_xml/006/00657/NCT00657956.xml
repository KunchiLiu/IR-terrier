	<detailed_description>Hip knee replacement arthroplasty profoundly successful operative intervention , however , joint replacement fail life expectancy hip knee arthroplasty finite . This fact largely responsible continue development new device technique joint arthroplasty surgery . Unfortunately , introduction new technology device benign process , even subtle change exist implant disastrous effect patient outcome . The fact new technology device lead poor result lead author advocate phase introduction new technology . A key component phase introduction approach advocate use roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( RSA ) early test process . RSA highly accurate radiographic technique develop Lund , Sweden time gold standard Europe assess stability implant within bone . It least ten time accurate conventional radiography . RSA involve insertion small tantalum marker ( 0.8mm ) bone prosthesis time surgery . By use calibrate cage additional marker simultaneous bi-planar x-ray , micromotion prosthesis-bone interface precisely determine . Two type micromotion investigate : migration , i.e . gradual motion time , inducible displacement , i.e . instant motion response external force . The pattern micromotion exhibit various prosthesis fixation technique within first post-operative year show predictive long-term fixation component bone , especially consider tibial prosthesis-bone interface . The value precise radiographic technique new technology technique introduce vivo limit exposure patient possible . RSA proven , safe invaluable method assess method knee component fixation well different design concept . DEXA bone densitometry demonstrate reliable method determination bone mineral density knee hip implant . This technique provide detail quality fixation knee hip prostheses implant induce bone remodeling . The foam metal back Advance Knee Arthroplasty component utilize porous titanium coat non-articulating surface component enhance implant-bone interface . This 3-dimensional scaffold promote bone in-growth may provide robust bone-implant interface . The high coefficient friction provide initial fixation negate need bone cement reduce duration surgery . There also version Biofoam Advance incorporate screw fixation allow augment fixation four titanium screw , however , clear augmentation necessary . The implant base previous proven design Wright Medical Whiteside Advance Medial Pivot . It incorporate polyethylene , tibial tray stem design Advance Medial Pivot four stabilize peg underside tibial component use Whiteside . Of particular interest modularity Biofoam design , polyethylene tibial stem attach tibial tray intraoperatively stem hold place morse taper , potentially provide surgeon size position option surgery . Study Objective The purpose study utilize RSA elucidate migration pattern foam metal back Advance Knee Arthroplasty component first 2 year postoperatively determine proportion case adequate fixation achieve . In addition outcome measure record quantify change functional status subject surgery bone mineral density monitor quantify bone in-growth around implant . Migration pattern compare result obtain previous study uncemented cemented total knee arthroplasty component conduct centre . Study Design This consecutive sample randomize control trial patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty foam metal back Advance Biofoam Knee Arthroplasty system ( Wright Medical Inc. ) without screw utilize RSA identify migration pattern tibial femoral component implant . DEXA scan also conduct determine change bone mineral density adjacent implant . Health status functional outcome measure record quantify functional status subject surgery follow-up interval . Statement research question Question 1 : Is difference fixation proximal tibia tibial component fix screw without screw ? Null Hypothesis : There significant difference micromotion pattern foam metal back arthroplasty component fix screw fix without . Alternative Hypothesis : There significant difference micromotion pattern tibial component fix screw fix without . Question 2 : Do screw component achieve adequate fixation underlie bone ? Null Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration 2 year screw component indicate adequate long-term fixation implant - bone interface . Alternative Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration 2 year screw component indicate inadequate fixation implant - bone interface . Question 3 : Do unscrew component achieve adequate fixation underlie bone ? Null Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration 2 year unscrewed component indicate adequate long-term fixation implant - bone interface . Alternative Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration 2 year unscrewed component indicate inadequate fixation implant - bone interface . Question 4 : What migration pattern ( translation rotation ) foam metal back arthroplasty component first two year postoperatively compare fix screw fix without screw ? Question 5 : For proportion implant group migration continue increase two year follow-up ? Question 6 : Is significant difference health status functional outcome total knee arthroplasty use foam metal back arthroplasty component ? Question 7 : Are significant difference bone mineral density operative knee ( distal femur proximal tibia ) body sit time ? Subjects n= 21 per group Allowing 20 % lose follow-up total sample size 50 ( 25 per group ) sufficient elucidate significant difference micromotion ( clinically significant motion define ≥ 0.2 mm ) group . Subjects screen consecutively enrol clinic inform consent obtain . Their vital information co-morbidities record chart functional status assess use KSCRS , SF-36 , WOMAC , Oxford 12 knee score , UCLA Activity Level , Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire ( SCQ ) , Pain Catastrophizing Scale ( PCS ) visual analogue scale pain health status .
