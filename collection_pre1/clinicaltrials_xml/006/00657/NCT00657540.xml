	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness safety new antivenom call Analatro® treat black widow spider bite patient present hospital emergency room within 24 hour symptom onset . This study phase III , multi-center , double-blind , randomize control study take place emergency department . The primary aim study determine proportion patient pain control achieve 48 hour post treatment . Secondary aim follow : 1 ) reduction pain intensity end treatment phase compare baseline ; 2 ) proportion patient clinically significant decrease pain intensity 30 minute post-treatment ; 3 ) proportion patient drug-related adverse event occur ; 4 ) determine serious , drug-related adverse event Analatro-treated patient occur rate great one 10 ( 10 % ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Instituto Bioclon S.A. de C.V. develop Analatro® , antibody fragment ( Fab2 ) contain widow spider ( Latrodectus ) antivenom , propose conduct clinical trial hospital emergency department assess efficacy safety product patient moderate severe pain associate Latrodectus envenomation ( latrodectism ) . The primary objective Phase III , multi-center , double-blind , control study follow : To determine efficacy Analatro compare control treatment latrodectism measure proportion patient pain control achieve ( e.g. , treatment failure ) To characterize safety profile Analatro , include comparison rate drug-related adverse event control treatment latrodectism The flow study procedure illustrate chart follow page . All patient consent participate give visual analog scale ( VAS , 0=no pain 100mm=worst possible pain ) assess pain intensity . Patients meet study enrollment requirement , include minimum age 10 year , clinical diagnosis latrodectism VAS pain score ≥40 mm ( moderate severe pain ) randomly assign treated Analatro control . A screening phase complete , time preliminary procedure perform investigator ( medical history , physical exam , pregnancy test applicable ) two dos Analatro two dos saline control prepare . Fentanyl may administer intravenously need pain relief screen phase dosage exceed 1.5 µg/kg/hr . At end screen phase , baseline measurement ( vital sign , VAS pain score ) perform . Patients must baseline VAS score ≥40 mm receive study medication . Eligible patient begin 2.5 hour treatment phase . Dose 1 study medication ( 50 mL ) infuse intravenously 10 minute . Thirty minute start Dose 1 , pain intensity assess ( VAS2 ) , vital sign record ( VS2 ) , blood sample collect ( B2 ) . Clinical improvement study define VAS score least 13mm less baseline VAS score ( VAS1 ) . Patients fail show clinical improvement 30 minute receive Dose 2 study medication ( Dose 2 identical Dose 1 ) . Patients show clinical improvement receive Dose 2 . Thirty minute VAS2 ( start Dose 2 , applicable ) , VAS3 administer , vital sign ( VS3 ) record , blood sample ( B3 ) collect . If patient clinically improve relative baseline , patient deem treatment failure ; treatment phase discontinue , patient treat accordance standard care investigator and/or treat physician . Patients clinically improve remain treatment arm . The remain 1.5 hour treatment arm consist serial assessment pain intensity ( VAS4 , 5 6 ) , vital sign ( VS4 , 5 6 ) , collection one blood sample ( B4 , 5 6 ) every 30 minute . After VAS , patient must continue show clinical improvement relative baseline remain treatment arm . Otherwise , patient exit treatment phase treat accordance standard care . No analgesic allow treatment phase eliminate potential confound effect pain medication assess effectiveness study medication clinical improvement . Routine decision point treatment failure ( every thirty minute ) promote accurate identification treatment failure without compromise timely provision pain medication absence clinical improvement . All patient closely monitored adverse event Dose 1 treatment time discharge emergency department . Follow-up possible adverse event recurring/residual symptom conduct telephone Days 2 , 10 , 17 discharge emergency department . Treatment failure define ( 1 ) early exit treatment phase due absence clinical improvement relative baseline and/or ( 2 ) patient require prescription pain medication Antivenin Latrodectus Mactans ( Merck ) pain associate study condition treat time treatment phase 48 hour time discharge emergency department . To improve accurate identification treatment failure discharge , preventative pain medication administer prescribed patient successfully complete treatment phase . Patients encourage call investigator return emergency department , necessary , proper evaluation treatment .</detailed_description>
