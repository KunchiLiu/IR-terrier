	<detailed_description>Combination drug therapy necessary optimal blood pressure reduction current guideline mandate concomitant use ACE inhibitor β-blockers patient significant risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event . There also continue interest combine angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) ACE inhibitor hypertension base unsubstantiated belief `` complete '' renin-angiotensin system inhibition desirable . It attractive physiologically combine long-acting β-blocker vasodilatory action ( Coreg CR ) ACE inhibitor combination address directly two fundamental hemodynamic change need reduce CVD event : lower systolic BP ( afterload ) lower heart rate ; product two reliable surrogate reduce cardiac work . In fact , clinical trial data suggest appreciable additional BP lower ARBs add ACE inhibitor neither class lower heart rate . The present proposal design demonstrate superior `` cardioprotection '' Coreg CR compare ARB ( valsartan ) add background ACE inhibitor therapy . Principal dependent variable include ambulatory cardiac work ( 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP x heart rate ) laboratory stress response ( central systolic time-tension index derive arterial tonometry pre- post-bicycle exercise ) . Secondary hemodynamic variable define change flow pressure ( e.g . central systolic BP forward reflect pressure wave estimation ) .</detailed_description>

A subject meeting follow condition exclude study : History serious adverse effect ACE inhibitor , Coreg , valsartan Known suspect cause secondary hypertension ( e.g. , renovascular stenosis , primary hyperaldosteronism ) Known ischemic heart disease require betablocker therapy ( include angina , prior transmural myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass graft surgery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stenting within 6 month prior study entry ) . Heart failure ( NYHA Functional Class IIIV ) Obstructive valvular heart disease obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Presence clinically significant ventricular supraventricular arrhythmia ( e.g . atrial fibrillation/flutter ) , preexcitation syndrome , second third degree AV block , conduction defect necessitate implantation permanent cardiac pacemaker , sick sinus syndrome . Chronic kidney disease ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 within past 6 month ) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( i.e. , fast blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL [ &gt; 11.1 mmol/L ] hemoglobin A1c &gt; 10 % History alcohol drug abuse within 6 month prior enrollment Concomitant treatment probable need treatment prohibit medication . NSAIDs , diabetes medication chronic med permit continue throughout study without dosage change . Any medical condition render subject unable complete study would interfere optimal participation study produce significant risk subject Those persistent systolic BP elevation 179 mmHg discontinue study significant adverse effect medication .
