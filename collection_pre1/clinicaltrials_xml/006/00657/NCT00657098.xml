	<detailed_description>Background In recent year , multiple new agent develop inhibit angiogenesis epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway . The cell signal route inhibit agent however active tumour formation also involve physiological process normal tissue organ . This mean drug anti tumour effect also modify several physiological process lead side effect . Little known side effect generally less severe side effect cytotoxic chemotherapy , target therapy often administer prolonged period time , side effect seriously affect quality life . Objectives Primary objective 1 . To determine characteristic , frequency severity vascular , metabolic hormonal side effect angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . Secondary objective 1 . To investigate steroid profile , indol profile , concentration catecholamines metanephrines thyroid antibody change treatment angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . 2 . To investigate known biomarkers change treatment . 3 . To investigate whether vascular function change treatment angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . 4 . To determine change skin autofluorescence development AGE 's occur treatment angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . 5 . To determine whether change factor mention secondary objective 1-4 correlated side effect target therapy and/or response angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . 6 . To evaluate polymorphisms gene involve pathway mention 1-4 associate toxicity efficacy angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . Study design population This prospective , explorative observational cohort study patient treat angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor . Concomitant chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiotherapy allow . Patients must 18 year old start treatment must willing give write informed consent . Primary study parameter Patients evaluate vascular change measure - 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure - nail fold capillary microscopy - skin autofluorescence 3 time point : start treatment , 3 6 week treatment . Patients also ask measure blood pressure home twice day , 6 week . Metabolic hormonal change investigation biomarkers do blood urine analyse every 3 week first 3 month , every 6 week 6 month every 3 month thereafter . Changes vascular , hormonal metabolic status related clinical side effect response treatment . Secondary study parameter When clinically relevant difference side effect response treatment find among patient treat agent , DNA analysis carry investigate change candidate gene relate difference . Burden risk associated participation , benefit group relatedness The minimal invasive test perform routine outpatient visit . As far know serious adverse event link describe study procedure . With study hope get insight characteristic , frequency , severity underlie mechanisms angiogenesis EGFR inhibitor induce vascular , metabolic hormonal side effect find usable surrogate marker efficacy treatment . Eventually , may contribute early detection vascular , metabolic hormonal change , design intervention strategy side effect well patient selection angiogenesis EGFR inhibition .</detailed_description>
