	<brief_summary>Significant progress make treatment woman Her2 positive breast cancer treat trastuzumab , humanize monoclonal antibody inhibit Her2 . Despite progress patient Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer respond trastuzumab patient metastatic disease respond usually develop progressive disease treatment trastuzumab . The mechanism resistance unknown . We propose investigate mechanism trastuzumab resistance Her2 positive breast cancer . The hypothesis examine basic science section study IRS-1 IRS-2 modifier HER2 signal adapter protein could predictive indicator treatment response Herceptin patient candidate target therapy . The connection IRS-1 IRS-2 expression Herceptin response clinical outcome HER2 positive human breast tumor evaluate determine IRS expression correlate resistance Herceptin therapy aggressive behavior tumor . This study establish IRS proteins influence HER2 function tumor predictive marker evaluate treatment option HER2 positive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty percent invasive breast cancer overexpress Her2 neu . These breast cancer aggressive high relapse rate shorten overall survival . Trastuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody FDA approve treatment Her2 overexpressing breast cancer . Trastuzumab active single agent treat metastatic breast cancer combine chemotherapy improve time progression overall survival woman metastatic her2 overexpressing breast cancer . In adjuvant setting recent clinical trial demonstrate improved relapse free survival patient high risk node negative node positive breast cancer . In neoadjuvant setting patient locally advance breast cancer response rate high complete pathologic responses 50-60 % patient . Although trastuzumab essential agent optimal treatment Her2 positive breast cancer , patient respond metastatic setting trastuzumab curative indicate resistance develops . The mechanism resistance unknown . The fact HER2-expressing breast cancer tumor respond Herceptin treatment , tumor eventually develop resistance drug , underscore need additional research HER2 function promote aggressive behavior tumor tumor become resistant Herceptin . Recent report implicate IGF-1 signal pathway mechanism HER2 action resistance Herceptin . The IRS proteins major downstream effector IGF-1 receptor play critical role determine cellular response IGF-1 stimulation . Therefore , IRS proteins may also signal modifier HER2 receptor may contribute Herceptin resistance result compensatory signal IGF-1R .</detailed_description>
