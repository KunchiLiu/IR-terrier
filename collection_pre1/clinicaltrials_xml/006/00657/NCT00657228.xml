	<detailed_description>Anaphylaxis potentially life-threatening entity require immediate recognition aggressive treatment . Although anaphylaxis infrequent , comprise 1 % approximately 1.03 million visit ED year relate allergic reaction , none less generally under-recognized under-treated disease , worthy study due potential fatal outcome . Recently , renew interest commonly use inexpensive drug ( heparin ) novel component therapy anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction . Heflin eft al . induce anaphylactoid reaction pig compare intravenous unfractionated heparin one treatment arm standard therapy ( intravenous epinephrine diphenhydramine ) versus placebo . The study reveal heparin rapidly reverse shock similar standard emergency treatment . Of course single study do pig change practice , warrant investigation role heparin play anaphylaxis human .</detailed_description>
