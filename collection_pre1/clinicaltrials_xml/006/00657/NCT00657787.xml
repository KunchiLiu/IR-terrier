	<brief_summary>The overall objective project develop first longitudinal registry combat-exposed men woman PTSD . This registry provide essential data natural history , include progression remission , outcomes associate PTSD military service men woman utilize Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) health care system . Additional goal project determine risk factor PTSD among combat-exposed service men woman ( incorporate combat-exposed non-PTSD group veteran analyse ) , assess joint effect combat exposure PTSD broad range outcome measure ( incorporate non-combat-exposed group veteran analyse ) . Thus , registry allow evaluation current theoretical model symptom development progression large sample service men woman utilize VA medical system . In addition PTSD registry , collect information two comparison group OIF/OEF-era veteran conduct nested case control study within general VA health care utilization database . First , comparison group combat veteran high utilizer VA medical care , receive diagnosis PTSD identify . This group use analysis identify risk factor PTSD . Additionally , rate PTSD symptom evaluate comparison group estimate prevalence miss PTSD diagnosis among combat veteran high rate service utilization , result impact utilization outcome . A second comparison group consist veteran similar service record demographic background , deploy OIF/OEF war zone . Thus , propose project create PTSD registry VA database assess natural history progression PTSD combat veteran OIF/OEF also conduct case-control study nest within VA database . The case-control comparison use evaluate key hypothesis relate specific aim overall project .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project design address range research question within registry , well comparison non-registry group . Specific aim project divide follow major research area . 1 . Epidemiology PTSD Aim 1 . To evaluate natural history PTSD , include progression remission symptom time , long-term psychosocial , medical quality life outcomes associate disorder Aim 2 . To identify predictor recovery remission PTSD , include treatment utilization , psychiatric medical comorbidities , sociodemographic factor Aim 3 . To identify clinical characteristic , risk factor comorbidities PTSD , include disparity gender , race/ethnicity , social support , socioeconomic status , compare PTSD patient `` control '' group veteran without PTSD 2 . PTSD Treatment Outcomes Aim 4 . To identify current treatment approach outcomes treatment time , particularly among service member often exclude clinical trial due comorbidities therefore remain unexamined possibly under-treated Aim 5 . To estimate joint effect combat exposure PTSD long-term psychosocial well-being quality life measure , compare PTSD patient `` control '' group veterans deploy combat/war zone time period 3 . Health Services Research Aim 6 . To establish prevalence PTSD comparison group service men woman receive PTSD diagnosis patient record high utilizer VA medical system , identify risk factor miss PTSD diagnosis Aim 7 . To provide data immediately useful determine future health service policy , cost , need upcoming research , manpower training , assess current referral utilization pattern . Both direct indirect ( e.g. , productivity loss , pharmacological burden ) cost treatment assess Aim 8 . To develop large database serviceman woman PTSD network treatment sit potentially available observational interventional study , well concurrent ancillary study , qualitative study caregiver/family burden . The propose project conduct three phase three year use exist data VA medical record database prospective data collect structured interview third phase study , well periodic data transfer medical record . During first phase ( month 1-9 ) , data de-identification procedure study pre-tested ( month 1-2 ) , data prepare abstraction ( month 2-4 ) , study protocol research interview review finalize ( month 6-9 ) . During Phase II ( month 4-12 ) , preliminary PTSD database create data transfer ( month 4 ) , query reports/resolutions ( month 5 ) . Also phase , analyse exist data extract VA medical record system conduct ( month 10-12 ) target cohorts follow-up assessment identify . Phase III ( month 12-36 ) include subject recruitment PTSD registry two comparison group , structure telephone interview conduct three group ( month 12-24 ) . Data collect telephone interview cod , de-identified merge overall study database . Analyses conduct phase ( month 24-36 ) relate Specific Aims study . The PTSD registry database update new VA electronic medical record registry participant appear course project , thereby capture trajectory PTSD patient . Participants Sampling Strategy The source participant VA in/outpatient electronic medical record new utilizer VA medical system FY 2002 2007 . According data DOD Defense Manpower Data Center ( DMDC ) receive VA Environmental Epidemiology Service ( EES ) April 17 , 2007 , FY 2002 February 2007 , total 717,196 unique OIF/OEF veteran ( exclude 3,303 died theater ) separate active duty follow deployment , therefore eligible VA benefit . Of , 252,095 ( 35 % ) obtain VA health care March 2007 . More recent healthcare data September 2007 indicate 263,909 individual access VA health care . The VA health administrative database rigorously record in-patient out-patient visit , include basic information regard visit , patient name , SSN , DOB , gender , ICD-9 diagnostic code describe purpose visit ( EES database ) . The overarch objective project-the creation PTSD registry-will accomplish identify male female OIF/OEF veteran entire VA medical record database new utilizer diagnosis PTSD ( define ICD-9 code 309.81 ) electronic medical record . We sample VA database recruit participant structure telephone interview obtain detail exposures outcomes interest capture exist database . A sample 800 PTSD patient OIF/OEF war zone experience , 400 patient without PTSD diagnosis OIF/OEF experience high utilization VA service , 400 individual match age , gender , race/ethnicity , year entry VA EES database , send war zone OIF/OEF recruit participate telephone interview . To representative veteran OIF/OEF era , sample stratify year entry VA database . Creation PTSD Registry Database Patient registry , define AHRQ World Health Organization , organize system contain information individual persons,42 patient registry database define file ( file ) derive registry . A patient-based database necessary allow direct access information diagnose interest treatment outcomes , well longitudinally track follow-up visit , progress , treatment course . In contrast criterion , current database utilizer VA healthcare system structure chronological in-patient out-patient visit , rather unique patient identifier diagnosis . Thus , exist database , readily accessible way identify unique patient PTSD assess longitudinal outcome utilization VA healthcare . Therefore , fundamental objective proposal establish registry patient PTSD exist VA utilization database . Electronic medical record VA database increasingly important source data , data must extract , transform registry format , load registry , reside registry database , together registry-specific data import source . The source data PTSD registry OIF/OEF veteran roster ( particularly military specific data , e.g. , branch , rank , deployment date , etc . ) , Phase III , propose telephone interview . During Phase I project , cumulative roster unique OIF/OEF veteran separate active duty follow deployment become eligible VA healthcare match VA inpatient ( PTF ) outpatient ( OPC ) databases fiscal year ( FY ) 2004 FY 2007 . For identification potential PTSD patient , veteran patient diagnosis ICD-9 CM , 308.81 select . The PTSD registry encompass utilizer VA medical system . Each unique patient visit record indicate PTSD diagnosis include . The registry creation involve multi-step process , include step identify PTSD diagnosis , identify unique patient within PTSD diagnosis , identify additional visit make PTSD patient . For identification OIF/OEF veteran non-PTSD patient high VA healthcare user ( sample # 2 ) , review in/outpatient record OIF/OEF veteran patient identify hospitalize treated outpatient 11 time post deployment period . A similar step take identify non-combat comparison group patient ( sample # 3 ) . All veteran patient three group stratify year first entry VA healthcare data base ( FY 2004-2007 ) equal number veteran patient randomly select fiscal year sample # 1 sample # 2 . For sample # 3 , additional matching variable age , gender , ethnicity/race use addition year entry VA healthcare database . Ultimately , Phase II , exist VA medical utilization data OIF/OEF veteran ' roster data veteran patient merge de-identified ensure privacy confidentiality . During Phase III , data obtain telephone interview merge exist data PTSD registry database . The PTSD registry continue update 6-month interval course project new updated electronic medical record enter VA in/outpatient healthcare database registry participant .</detailed_description>
