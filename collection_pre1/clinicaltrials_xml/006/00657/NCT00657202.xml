	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine ranibizumab prevent growth neurofibromas . We also collect extra blood serum sample help u learn NF1 . Ranibizumab drug affect development blood vessel fee tumor . It target substance body call VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) . VEGF help tumor grow survive support growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor . VEGF make cancerous tumor also non-cancerous tumor neurofibromas .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive one injection ranibizumab 3 tumor skin ( one dose per tumor ) day 1 treatment . One tumor inject normal saline solution . The saline solution-called control-is necessary determine whether injection ( without medicine ) cause tumor shrink . Tumors measure photographed prior treatment . Ranibizumab tumor remove day 8 , 15 , 29 ; saline treat tumor remove day 29 . - Participants come clinic week total 4 week Days 35 . 57 85 post-treatment visit . Some following test procedure perform : physical examination ( include photograph tumor ) , review current medication , vital sign , routine blood test , serum chemistry blood test , interstitial fluid pressure measurement tumor sample .</detailed_description>
