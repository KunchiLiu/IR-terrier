	<brief_summary>Patients chronic lung disease often report shortness breath use arm simple activity daily live dress , lift , shave , bath brush hair teeth . The best type arm training patient still unknown . The objective study : - develop feasible safe arm training program ( ATP ) patient ; - examine effect ATP quality life , arm function , arm exercise capacity symptom activity daily live ; - examine effect ATP breathe response arm exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arm Training Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common condition throughout Canada rest world . Patients COPD often describe breathlessness make difficult participate physical activity . Specifically , patient often report shortness breath use arm simple activity daily live dress , lift bathing . Exercise train show reduce breathlessness people COPD . Compared study look effect exercise use leg muscle , study focus train arm muscle people COPD sparse . Although early work show arm training increase arm exercise capacity , effect measure breathlessness clear . Therefore , objective study ; ( ) develop feasible safe arm training program ( ATP ) patient COPD base best available evidence , ( ii ) examine effectiveness ATP breathlessness activity daily live , health-related quality life , arm function arm exercise capacity , ( iii ) examine physiological mechanism underpin change outcome response ATP . Patients COPD assign chance either treatment control group . All patient group complete 6-week pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) program well-established centre ( West Park ) . During program patient complete leg exercise , walk cycling , receive education best manage disease . In addition PR program , treatment group complete specific ATP involve overhead arm exercise free weight . The control group undergo `` sham '' ATP consist finger exercise . Before ATP collect measure ; ( ) breathlessness activity daily live , fatigue quality life , ( ii ) arm exercise capacity , ( iii ) arm function , ( iv ) arm muscle force . During test arm exercise capacity special machine ( breathing-gas analysis system ) worn . Measurements compare treatment control group , immediately ATP also 3 month complete ATP .</detailed_description>
