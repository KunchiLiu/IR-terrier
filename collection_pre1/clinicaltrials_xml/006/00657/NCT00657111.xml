	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety tolerability investigational inhaled flu medication , CS-8958 . Study participant include 38 elderly male female , age 65 old . Participants divide 1 4 possible treatment group ( Groups A , B , C D ) receive study drug placebo ( substance contain medication ) . Group A receive 5 mg CS-8958 , Group B receive 10 mg CS-8958 , Group C receive 20 mg CS-8958 Group D receive 40mg CS-8958 . Safety information review prior administer high dose treatment . Study procedure include blood urine sample , ECGs ( measure heart activity ) , 7 day clinic stay . Participants involve study related procedure 6 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CS-8958 Single Inhaled Dose Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza acute febrile illness cause influenza A B virus affect age group . Influenza occur annually year estimate influenza epidemic cause 36,000 death 114,000 hospitalization US alone . Influenza infection generally self-limiting ; however significant morbidity mortality occur , predominantly high risk group elderly suffer chronic condition . This study Phase I , double-blind , placebo-controlled , ascend single inhale dose , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic study elderly subject stable health status . The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability CS-8958 ( 5 , 10 20 40 mg ) elderly subject single dose administer via inhalation . Primary outcome measure safety tolerability address term occurrence treatment-emergent adverse event ( AEs ) , change vital sign include blood pressure pulse rate , functional oxygen saturation arterial hemoglobin , oral body temperature , electrocardiogram , spirometry [ Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ] , Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , Forced Expiry Volume percentage 1 second ( FEV1.0 % ) , Forced Expiratory Flow Rate ( FEF ) 25 % -75 % ) , Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR , also call PEF ) , physical examination , psychological assessment , laboratory parameter . The secondary objective study assess systemic exposure CS-8958 active metabolite R-125489 single inhaled dos CS-8958 elderly subject . The secondary outcome measure pharmacokinetic parameter calculate CS-8958 R-125489 ( active metabolite ) concentration plasma urine use non-compartmental approach . These measurement use assess systemic exposure CS-8958 active metabolite elderly subject single inhale dose CS-8958 ( 5 , 10 , 20 40 mg ) . This data help determine safety margin dose elderly subject future study . Thirty-eight healthy adult ( male female ) , age 65 year old , stable health status , recruit UK base study . Subjects study 4 group ( Groups A D ) group consist least 8 subject . Within group , subject randomly allocate Arm 1 Arm 2 . Arm 1 receive investigational drug lactose 25 mg ( placebo ) Arm 2 receive placebo . Treatment begin low dose 5 mg ( Group A ) subsequent high dose 10 , 20 40 mg ( Group B , C D , respectively ) It plan dos administer escalate manner . The Safety Monitoring Committee review safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic data group prior administration next dose . Following review , dose increment subsequent group may increase , dos administer may reduce , may lower start dose . The maximum dose level study 40 mg . The duration study subject maximum 6 week initial screen follow-up visit . The screening period 4 week follow 7 day clinic follow visit 5-7 day leave clinic .</detailed_description>
