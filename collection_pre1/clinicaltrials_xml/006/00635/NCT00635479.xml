	<brief_title>Role Vacuum Assisted Closure ( VAC ) Device Postoperative Management Pelvic Acetabular Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue injury commonly associate pelvic acetabular injury additional tissue injury occur surgery . Post operative wound drainage , infection prolong hospital stay common problem postoperative care . Traditional treatment dress surgical wound different conventional dressing . Use negative pressure wound therapy show beneficial significantly decrease wound drainage . Stannard et al . report result randomize 44 patient low extremity fracture ( include 4 pilon fracture ) either receive standard post operative dress versus NPWT ( negative pressure wound therapy ) . His result show difference infection rate wound breakdown , show significant difference drainage time . The NPWT group stop drain 3 day earlier standard dress group . The use NPWT greatly increase year important adjunct wound management . These result anecdotal clinical experience use NPWT ( wound VAC ) lead u develop research question ; Does use incisional VAC follow pelvic &amp; /or acetabular surgery decrease wound complication . The VAC ( KCI USA ) device relatively new device utilize negative pressure treatment modality soft tissue injury follow high velocity injury . VAC device exerts intermittent constant negative pressure remove excess fluid interstitial space increase perfusion vessel . Previous VAC study show decreased bacterial load apply VAC device infect wound . There randomized study prove cost effectiveness efficacy VAC device reduce wound drainage , infection , prolong hospital stay comparison traditional gauze dress wound management post operative management pelvic acetabular fracture . In examine incidence wound complications/infections , determine incisional VAC decrease need additional intervention patient relate factor ( i.e . obesity ) relate increase risk wound complication .</detailed_description>
