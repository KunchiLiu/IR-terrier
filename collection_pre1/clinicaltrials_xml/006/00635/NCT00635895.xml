	<brief_title>Comparison Lymph Drainage Connective Tissue Massage Fibromyalgia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The lack specific disease mechanism reflect fact cure find disease . Thus , many intervention advocate FM target general characteristic pain disability . Current pharmacological intervention limit efficacy . There increase consensus therapy also include non-pharmacological approach . Manual therapy technique compose variety procedure direct musculoskeletal structure treatment pain . Two major subcategories exist divide technique produce joint motion . The first subcategory include manipulation , mobilization , manual traction . The second subcategory involve generalize soft tissue therapy , many type massage , focal soft tissue therapy ( 10 ) . Consequently , currently recognize effective treatment FM patient . In addition , limited number study deal effect manual therapy technique FM . Although , study Manual Lymph Drainage Therapy ( MLDT ) Connective Tissue Massage ( CTM ) FM . There n't find study concern comparison effect MLDT CTM . In study , MLDT CTM use FM , include second subcategory manual therapy technique . Based positive result study MLDT CTM FM , study plan test compare effect MLDT CTM term pain , health status HRQoL females FM use randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
