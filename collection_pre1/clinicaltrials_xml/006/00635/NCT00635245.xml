	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , CP-751871 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best way give CP-751871 treating patient early-stage breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CP-751871 In Treating Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary - To evaluate change total tumor choline level woman operable early breast cancer response neoadjuvant CP-751871 treatment . Secondary - To assess change tumor glucose level CP-751871 treatment use magnetic resonance spectroscopy patient . - To assess safety , tolerability , immunogenicity CP-751871 patient . - To assess effect CP-751871 Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) signal marker tumor tissue patient . - To assess clinical efficacy CP-751871 patient ( MRI pathological response ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive CP-751871 IV 5 hour day 1 22 undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy day 8 29 . Patients may also undergo surgery day 29-43 obtain tumor sample analysis marker related IGR-1R pathway . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 month .</detailed_description>
