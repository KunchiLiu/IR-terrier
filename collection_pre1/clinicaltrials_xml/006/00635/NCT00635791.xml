	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give vorinostat sorafenib tosylate together treat patient kidney non-small cell lung cancer . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth solid tumor block blood flow tumor . Giving vorinostat together sorafenib tosylate may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
