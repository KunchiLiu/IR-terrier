	<brief_summary>Hyperbilirubinemia common problem term preterm newborn intensive care nursery around world . It condition much bilirubin blood . Bilirubin substance naturally release red blood cell break . In early newborn period , multiple factor lead abnormally elevate bilirubin level . Large amount bilirubin circulate tissue brain may cause seizure brain damage . About 6.1 % term newborns high percentage preterm newborn develop hyperbilirubinemia require treatment . Initiating treatment depend many factor , include cause hyperbilirubinemia , level serum indirect bilirubin , rate indirect bilirubin rise , age patient . The goal treatment keep level bilirubin rise dangerous level . The bilirubin molecule absorbs light . Therefore , treatment hyperbilirubinemia involve exposure baby 's skin special blue spectrum light . Phototherapy globally recognize standard care treatment elevate indirect hyperbilirubinemia neonatal period . This light exposure convert water-insoluble indirect bilirubin easily excrete soluble molecule . Over last five year , several device introduce emit high intensity light blue portion visible light spectrum . However , despite frequent use therapy , effectiveness different phototherapy device adequately compare . The objective study compare efficacy blue LED fiberoptic phototherapy metal halide spot phototherapy versus blue LED bank light phototherapy versus combination tandem therapy lower total serum bilirubin .</brief_summary>
