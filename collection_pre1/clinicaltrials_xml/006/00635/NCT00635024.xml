	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , anti-thymocyte globulin , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Anti-thymocyte globulin may also make cancer cell sensitive melphalan . Giving anti-thymocyte globulin together melphalan may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give anti-thymocyte globulin together melphalan work treat patient relapsed multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-thymocyte Globulin Melphalan Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * To evaluate hematological response rate anti-thymocyte globulin give combination melphalan patient relapse multiple myeloma . Secondary - To assess toxicity tolerability combination patient . - To assess time disease progression patient treat drug . - To assess survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV 6 hour melphalan IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course . Patients receive melphalan alone another 6 course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
