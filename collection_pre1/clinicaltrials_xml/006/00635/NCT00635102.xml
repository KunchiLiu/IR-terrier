	<brief_summary>Question # 1 : Will glycine ameliorate cognitive deficit ? Hypothesis # 1 : Based positive finding conduct glycine milacemide , glycine prodrug , schizophrenia dementia , expect glycine ameliorate cognitive deficit . Question # 2 : Will alcoholic patient show enhanced endocrinal effect glycine ? Hypothesis # 2 : Based dose-related effect glycine healthy subject , expect glycine increase endocrinal response glycine alcoholic patient , supposedly , dysregulated NMDA receptor function . Question # 3 : Will D-cycloserine ethanol-like effect ? Hypothesis # 3 : If inhibition NMDA receptor function fundamental subjective effect ethanol , NMDA antagonist property D-cycloserine recognize ethanol-like ( relative placebo ) recently detoxify alcoholic healthy subject . Question # 4 : Will D-cycloserine reverse cognitive benefit glycine ? Hypothesis 4 : Based dose related NMDA antagonist activity D-cycloserine , expect D-cycloserine compete agonist activity glycine therefore reverse cognitive benefit glycine . Question # 5 : Will D-cycloserine inhibit endocrinal effect glycine ? Hypothesis # 5 : If agonist activity glycine necessary determine endocrine response , dose-related NMDA antagonist property D-cycloserine block effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate interaction glycine D-cycloserine alcoholic patient healthy subject . Preclinical study show compound act glycine site N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor complex , glycine , may reverse effect ethanol NMDA receptor function ( Rabe et al. , 1990 ) . The amino acid glycine co-agonist NMDA receptor complex ( Kemp et al. , 1993 ) . It bind strychnine-insensitive site positively modulate NMDA receptor ( Mc Donald et al. , 1990 ) . Physiologically , glycine site saturate , administration glycine potentiate NMDA receptor mediate response . In contrast , D-cycloserine ( Hood et al. , 1989 ) partial-agonist glycine site NMDA receptor , dose-dependent NMDA antagonist property . The NMDA antagonist activity D-cycloserine produce ethanol like-effects reversed agonist glycine . This study intend evaluate possible contribution glycine site reduction cognitive deficit alcoholism complement current work VA Connecticut Healthcare System NMDA antagonists alcoholic healthy subject .</detailed_description>
