	<detailed_description>Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) increase risk atherosclerotic morbidity mortality.OSA associate development and/or worsen arterial hypertension , traditional risk factor atherosclerosis.Moreover , OSA link novel factor relate atherogenesis - metabolic syndrome , systemic inflammation,6 oxidative stress . Numerous study selectively examine effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ventilation , primary treatment OSA , traditional novel risk factor atherosclerosis . A recent metaanalysis 16 randomized trial indicate CPAP decrease blood pressure patient OSA.9 Furthermore , reduction serum total cholesterol , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin ( IL ) -6 IL-8 demonstrate effective CPAP therapy.In addition , CPAP show reduce systemic oxidative stress.Improvements insulin sensitivity report , study . Importantly , substantial evidence link effect CPAP compliance treatment . Most observational study examine effect CPAP across broad-range OSA severity , include patient without metabolic syndrome . Up , study analyze effect CPAP glucose lipid metabolism , systemic inflammation , oxidative stress , global cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk within cohort subject severe OSA concurrent metabolic syndrome . Importantly , metabolic syndrome exacerbates CVD risk attributable OSA alone . Therefore , reduction CVD risk patient OSA concurrent metabolic syndrome paramount importance . The primary purpose present study determine , patient severe OSA metabolic syndrome compliant CPAP , effect 8-weeks therapy glucose lipid profile , systemic inflammation , oxidative stress , global CVD risk . The secondary goal analyze factor related compliance CPAP .</detailed_description>
