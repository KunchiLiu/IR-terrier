	<brief_summary>The primary aim pilot study evaluate effect two variation ARCC Intervention Program nursing process outcome ( job satisfaction , group cohesion , EBP knowledge , EBP implementation , EBP belief ) , patient/family outcomes ( e.g . pt/family satisfaction care ) , institutional process outcome ( e.g . nurse-physician collaboration , cost , RN turnover , incidence frequency relevant topic ) . Secondary aim test feasibility study method reliability validity questionnaires . This study design three-group randomized clinical trial repeat measure . Three inpatient unit ( medicine , surgery , surgical intensive care ) randomly assign one three intervention : ARCC enhance ( didactic content presentation , use EBP tool kit stay unit , environmental EBP prompt , availability EBP coach unit ) ; ARCC standard ( , without coach ) ; non-EBP intervention ( didactic content environmental prompt , related EBP ; placebo ) . The intervention implement estimated 14 week , include 4-week training period , estimate 10 week implement EBP initiative nurse two ARCC intervention unit develop . Baseline information questionnaire collect nurse start study , completion intervention phase . Outcome data collect nurse approximately 10 week implementation ARCC intervention complete ( i.e. , 22 week study commence ) . Nurse-physician collaboration data collect physician work study unit nurse well nurse . Patient satisfaction data separately collect study , include use unit-level Press-Ganey score immediately prior study time period . Unit level institutional RN turnover track monthly entire study period compare across unit time well compare within study time ( i.e. , unit retention month previous year ) . Costs EBP intervention track study compare descriptively . Survey data analyze use analysis variance statistic . Questionnaires test reliability construct validity . Because pilot study , statistically significant difference expect , however , effect size calculate</brief_summary>
