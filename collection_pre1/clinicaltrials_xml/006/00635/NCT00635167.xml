	<brief_summary>Solid tumor , include prostate cancer , commonly exhibit tumor-associated neovascularity ( growth new blood vessel fee tumor ) increase microvessel density . Systemic , hormonal , radiotherapy treatment typically decrease suppress tumor - associate vascularity several mechanism , include apoptosis ( process cell death ) anti-angiogenic pathway ( way destroy new blood vessel growth ) . Previously investigator ' center , demonstrate increase prostatic vascularity ( blood vessel define prostate ) detect ultrasonographically correlate disease free survival radical prostatectomy ( surgical removal entire prostate ) , may indicative high grade , high stage disease . The significance prostate neovascularity response treatment external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) ( standard care ) well study . The investigator hypothesize prostate cancer recurs radiotherapy may exhibit measurable pattern tumor-associated vascularity , may represent minimally invasive marker cancer stage , grade response treatment . The investigator propose pilot study assess feasibility serial enhance transrectal ultrasonography ( TRUS ) examination radiotherapy prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
