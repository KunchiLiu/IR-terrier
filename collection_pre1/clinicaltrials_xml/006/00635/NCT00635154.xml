	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Some cancer need growth factor make body 's white blood cell keep growing.Anakinra may interfere growth factor stop multiple myeloma grow . Dexamethasone may stop cancer cell grow . Giving anakinra together dexamethasone may effective treatment multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well anakinra work give without dexamethasone treat patient smolder myeloma indolent multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra With Without Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Smoldering Indolent Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * Determine response rate patient smolder indolent multiple myeloma treat anakinra . Secondary - Determine toxicity anakinra alone combination dexamethasone patient . - Evaluate response rate patient treat anakinra combination dexamethasone . - Evaluate proportion patient progression-free 6 month . - Determine tolerability anakinra combination dexamethasone patient . - Determine time progression active multiple myeloma patient treat anakinra alone combination dexamethasone . - Assess duration response patient . OUTLINE : - Induction therapy : Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously ( SC ) daily 6 month ( month 1-6 ) . Based response , patient continue treatment one three way . - Complete response [ CR ] , good partial response [ VGPR ] , partial response [ PR ] , minimal response [ MR ] : Patients continue receive anakinra SC daily 6 additional month ( month 7-12 ) . Patients develop disease progression anytime proceed treatment high dose dexamethasone . - Stable disease : Patients receive low-dose oral dexamethasone weekly 6 month ( month 7-12 ) anakinra SC daily . Patients maintain stable disease respond continue low-dose oral dexamethasone anakinra SC daily 6 additional month ( month 13-18 ) . Patients develop disease progression time proceed treatment high dose dexamethasone . - Progressive disease : Patients receive high-dose oral dexamethasone day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 month 7 , 9 , 11 day 1-4 month 8 , 10 , 12 anakinra SC daily 6 additional month ( month 7-12 ) . NOTE : Patients may continue treatment beyond 12 month treat physician discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
