	<brief_summary>This study evaluate rate pathological complete response ( pCR ) sequential therapy Doxil , paclitaxel , cyclophosphamide concurrent Avastin patient locally advanced invasive ( T2 , T3 , Nany , M0 ) breast carcinoma . Also , study evaluate clinical subclinical cardiotoxic effect ( ) regimen , ass feasible safe study . Survival without progression disease also calculate . A regimen chemotherapy give replicate high rate pCR see conventional chemotherapy patient locally advance breast cancer . Doxil substitute normally give doxorubicin . It expect low effect minimal effect Doxil cardiac function minimize additional risk cardiotoxicity Avastin . It expect clinical subclinical rate cardiotoxicity low total dos give clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Using Doxil , Paclitaxel , Cyclophosphamide With Avastin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In trial , attempt make replicate high rate pathological complete response see conventional chemotherapy patient locally advance breast cancer , use regimen Doxil substitute conventional doxorubicin . We expect low minimal effect cardiac function produce Doxil minimize additional risk cardiotoxicity Avastin . We also measure leave ventricular ejection fraction treatment see substantial rate subclinical cardiotoxicity report Swain et al 5 Perez et al 7 avoid . The report rate cardiotoxicity treatment relatively high dos Doxil substantially low doxorubicin ; data available estimate rate cardiotoxicity Doxil patient treat 100 mg/m2 total accumulate dose , dose utilized . The drug use patient primary systemic therapy setting , report clinical cardiotoxicity . The expectation clinical subclinical rate cardiotoxicity low negligible total dos use .</detailed_description>
