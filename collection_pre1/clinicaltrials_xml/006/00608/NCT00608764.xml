	<brief_title>Examining Genetic Factors That May Cause Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD disease lung airways damage partly obstruct , make difficult breathe . Millions people United States COPD , third lead cause death United States . Symptoms include cough , excess mucus production , shortness breath , wheeze , chest tightness . Emphysema long-term bronchitis two common manifestation disease . The common risk factor develop COPD cigarette smoking ; however , 15 % 20 % smoker develop COPD lifetime . It known smoker develop COPD , certain genetic factor , combine exposure cigarette smoke , may increase likelihood develop COPD . This study analyze DNA current former cigarette smoker identify genetic factor marker may indicate predisposition develop COPD . This study enroll African-American white cigarette smoker former cigarette smoker without COPD . Participants attend one study visit complete questionnaire lung symptom , breathe difficulty , medical family history , quality life . They also undergo blood collection , physical exam , lung function testing , walk test measure endurance . Participants undergo high resolution compute tomography ( CT ) chest scan medical record review . Study researcher contact participant four time year 5 year collect follow-up medical information . A five year follow-up visit include similar study protocol baseline visit perform available subject .</detailed_description>
