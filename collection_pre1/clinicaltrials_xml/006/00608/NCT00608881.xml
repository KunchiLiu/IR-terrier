	<brief_title>Coenzyme Q10 Huntington 's Disease ( HD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) slowly progressive disorder devastate life affected family . There treatment slow progression HD , mildly effective symptomatic therapy available . The purpose trial find coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ ) effective slow worsen symptom HD . In study , researcher also learn safety acceptability long-term CoQ use determine effect people HD . Participants trial randomly choose one two group . Group 1 receive CoQ ( 2400 mg/day ) , group 2 receive placebo ( inactive substance ) . Researchers compare change total functional capacity ( TFC ) —a measure functional disability—in two group . The TFC valid reliable measure disease progression particularly responsive change early mid-stages HD . Researchers also compare change component Unified Huntington 's Disease Rating Scale '99 ( UHDRS ) include : total motor score , total behavioral frequency score , total behavior frequency X severity score , verbal fluency test , symbol digit modality test , Stroop , interference test , functional checklist , independence scale score . The group also compare respect tolerability , adverse event , vital sign , laboratory test result measure safety .</detailed_description>
