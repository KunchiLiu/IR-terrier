	<brief_title>Defining Strategies Improving Endothelial Fibrinolytic Dysfunction Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity increasingly important risk factor cardiovascular disease men woman associate premature development atherosclerosis , increase risk stroke . A classical perspective cardiovascular risk adequately explain cardiovascular event associate obesity . Elevated plasma level plasminogen activator inhibitor type I ( PAI-1 ) one biochemical hallmark obesity likely contribute increase risk atherothrombotic event patient obesity . The central hypothesis proposal increase risk atherothrombotic event patient obesity . The central hypothesis proposal vascular PAI-1 excess promotes development intravascular thrombosis . We test hypothesis secrete factor adipocytes autocrine , paracrine endocrine effect deleterious effect fibrinolytic system , either enhance PAI-1 production impair endothelial t-PA release . From public health perspective , great threat America 's cardiovascular health epidemic obesity . It anticipate study provide new insight nto molecular mechanism contribute development fibrinolytic dysfunction cardiovascular disease obesity .</detailed_description>
