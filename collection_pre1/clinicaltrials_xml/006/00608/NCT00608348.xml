	<brief_title>Sympathetic Nerve Activity During Hypoglycemia Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The body defensive response correct low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) . A vital component response release glucagon activation sympathetic nervous system , provide mean raise blood glucose level towards normal . We measure circulate hormone indicate level response , additionally , sympathetic nervous system response measure directly . We measure sympathetic nerve activity control blood flow muscle ( MSNA ) blood flow sweat skin ( SSNA ) . The purpose study determine either hypoglycemia exercise cause differential response muscle skin sympathetic nerve activity . We would also like determine sympathetic response cycling exercise insulin normal blood sugar . Therefore , would like test sympathetic response insulin normal blood glucose , hypoglycemia , exercise bout normal blood glucose , without insulin .</detailed_description>
