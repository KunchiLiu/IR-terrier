	<detailed_description>A three sequence , open-label , multi-center , prospective , study stable liver transplant patient assess compare pharmacokinetics ( Cmax , C24 , AUC ) , safety LCP-Tacro ( tacrolimus ) tablets versus Prograf ( tacrolimus ) capsule . Stable liver transplant patient fulfill I/E criterion enrol keep Prograf 7 day . Following 24-hour PK study Day 7 determine pharmacokinetics Prograf , patient convert daily LCP-Tacro 14 day one fix dose change allow Day 15 . On Day 14 Day 21 24-hour LCP-Tacro PK study perform . On Day 22 patient convert back original twice daily dose Prograf safety follow-up period 30 day end safety assessment day 53 .</detailed_description>
