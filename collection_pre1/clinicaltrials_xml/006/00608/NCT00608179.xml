	<brief_summary>This study look two FDA approve medication improve pancreas work patient Type 2 Diabetes . In order understand medication work patient diabetes must first measure normal response healthy volunteer without diabetes . We look body 's normal physiological response low blood sugar whether modify medicationsThe hypothesis would glimepiride induced insulin secretion inhibit hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glimepiride Induced Insulin Secretion Will Inhibited Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient type 2 diabetes , sulfonylurea drug mainstay effective glucose control . These agent produce hypoglycemic effect via stimulation endogenous insulin secretion . Oversecretion insulin , per se , continue relative increase hormone even plasma glucose normal result hypoglycemia . This latter situation commonly occur patient decides omit , delay , reduce size meal . An important defense hypoglycemia situation glucose dependent regulation insulin secretion . In word , low ambient glucose concentration could regulate magnitude amount insulin release response sulfonylurea . Thus hypoglycemic condition , sulfonylurea would result little insulin secretion , whereas effect hyperglycemia would amplify . Glimepiride glyburide second-generation sulfonlyurea drug use commonly treatment type 2 diabetes . This study compare two ask follow question : Is Glimepiride insulin secretion dependent upon glucose concentration in-vivo ?</detailed_description>
