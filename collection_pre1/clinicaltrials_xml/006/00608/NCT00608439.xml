	<detailed_description>This study clinical trial investigate effect herbal supplement call CAST diabetic neuropathy . CAST herb commonly use traditional Indian medicine . In tradition , use increase memory , treat wound sore , skin disease , neurological condition epilepsy . The herb grow popularity US ; part sell dietary supplement `` gotu kola '' use improve blood circulation help heal wound . Unlike many herb , CAST extensively research many condition . The compound find CAST make promising potential treatment diabetic neuropathy effect blood circulation growth nerve . Subjects receive inform consent . They screen eligibility enter study . A medical history take subject neurological exam vital sign take . Subjects blood drawn also give urine sample routine testing . Subjects electrocardiogram ( ECG ) check heart . If subject woman risk get pregnant , urine pregnancy test . If subject eligible participation study , return total nine additional study visit course year . Subjects randomly assign either receive active supplement ( CAST ) placebo . A placebo pill taste , look , smell like study drug real medicine ( supplement ) . Subjects 50 % chance receive active supplement . Neither subject study staff know receive active supplement placebo . At visit 2 , 7 10 , subject get comprehensive assessment neuropathy symptom . This include Neurological Disability Score assessment , nerve conduction study Quantitative Sensory Test . Subjects enrol study begin take study pill begin week 1 study . During first 12 week , subject ask increase dose one pill every four week . Therefore , increase number CAST placebo pill 60mg twice daily 60mg four time daily , high dose cause side effect . Dr. Lou monitor subject side effect study supplement . At study visit , blood urine sample take safety analysis , include liver kidney function , glucose control , ECG do monitor heart activity . Subjects contact study coordinator via phone call per week first three month study . During remainder study , call month schedule appointment . Treatment conclude one year .</detailed_description>
