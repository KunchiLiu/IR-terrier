	<brief_summary>You may type cancer associate `` antineuronal antibody '' blood . Antibodies substance make immune system . They use body fight infection disease . Antineuronal antibody antibodies react nerve cell also react tumor . We believe immune system make antibody fight cancer . In patient antibody , tumor small patient antibody . Sometimes , strong antibody test , patient may develop neurologic problem weakness , numbness memory loss . One purpose study determine patient cancer positive antineuronal antibody blood test small tumor respond well treatment patient cancer negative test . Another purpose study determine whether patient positive antibody test develop neurologic problem weakness , numbness memory loss . We measure blood several different kind antibody addition antineuronal antibody determine presence antibody predict `` prognosis '' , i.e . small tumor well response treatment , predict development neurologic problem . No tissue sample require study . However , tissue sputum obtain oncologist diagnostic purpose , ask doctor pathology department provide u sample specimen . This involve additional surgery discomfort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence+Significance Paraneoplastic Autoantibodies Many Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To determine prospectively prevalence specificity anti-Hu paraneoplastic antibody patient small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cancer include , limited , ovarian cancer , breast cancer Hodgkin 's disease / prevalence autoimmune antibody patient SCLC cancer include limited anti-nuclear antibody , anti-P53 antibody , rheumatoid factor anti-calcium channel antibodies /the prevalence significance antibody LEMS-related antigen ( MysB ) /whether production autoantibody include anti-Hu antibody relate patient MHC phenotype . - To examine tumor specimen available tissue ( sputum bone marrow , possible ) presence Hu antigen-expressing cell , and/or cell express paraneoplastic antigens/patients SCLC cancer development neurologic sign , paraneoplastic otherwise . - Attempts make evaluate patient time initial consultation primary oncologist . If possible , attempt make obtain neurological evaluation time next visit oncologist , case inpatient , patient 's admission . A complete history neurologic examination perform time neurologist documentation sign symptom . The patient give Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale complete ( see attach ) . - At initial evaluation , blood obtain follow laboratory study include limited ( child amount blood drawn 5 cc per Kg visit ) : A ) Rheumatoid Factor Anti-nuclear , anti-thyroglobulin , anti-microsomal , anti-Ro , antip53 antibody . B ) HLA Typing ( HLA-ABC , IEF , Class II DNA ) lymphocyte analysis C ) Anti-neuronal antibody , include HuD , HuC HeI-N1 , anti-Yo , anti-Ri , anti-Tr antibody D ) LEMS-associated antibody ( MysB antibody ) - At follow-up ( approximately every 4 month ) appointment , blood sample obtain follow study , include limited , anti-neuronal antibody HuC HeI-N1 ) LEMS-associated antibody ( MysB antibody ) . - Tissue sample obtain diagnosis course treatment ( tumor resection biopsy , sputum collection bone marrow aspiration ) evaluate expression Hu paraneoplastic antigen . - As part study , patient positive paraneoplastic antibody serology request undergo lumbar puncture antibody determination antibody , cellcount , chemistry ( protein , glucose , IgG index ) CSF . In pediatric neuroblastoma patient stage 4 neuroblastoma lumbar puncture avoid , since preliminary evidence suggest increase risk leptomeningeal dissemination . Antibody positive patient offer quantitative sensory test evaluation subclinical sensory neuronopathy . This test analyze minimum increment sensory stimulus ( cold , hot vibration ) require noticed patient , compare result know normal standard value . The test give clinical neurologist , cause discomfort . Conventional nerve conduction study EMG require , unless patient symptom sign neuropathy , patient asymptomatic quantitative sensory test abnormal . In situation nerve conduction EMG study upper low extremity obtain . All patient undergo CSF analysis , require blood test ( glucose , protein , IgG ) compare CSF value obtain IgG index ( measurement intrathecal synthesis IgG ) . - Patients positive anti-Mys B antibody serology , symptom suggest LEMS ( proximal weakness , decrease absent reflex ) offer EMG , nerve conduction study , repetitive stimulation . - A random sample 20 % patient present positive anti-Hu serology offer quantitative sensory test evaluation subclinical sensory neuropathy order serve control group . Spinal fluid patient undergo lumbar puncture reason unrelated anti-Hu serology result ( approximately 10-15 % patient ) serve control spinal fluid obtain seropositive patient . In patient sample blood obtain measure glucose , protein , IgG , IgG index</detailed_description>
