	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue , blood , urine patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change may occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict rectal cancer respond treatment celecoxib . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well celecoxib work treat patient early-stage rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Early-Stage Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) over-expression tumor specimens patient early-stage rectal cancer . - Determine whether administration COX-2 inhibitor , celecoxib , result change tumor ( COX-2 overexpressing ) level eicosanoids level surround normal tissue expect express COX-2 . - Determine whether surrogate marker eicosanoid metabolism ( i.e. , serum VEGF level , tumor prostaglandin E_2 [ PGE_2 ] , major urinary metabolite PGE_2 [ PGE-M ] ) biological specimen patient correlate change note tumor tissue . - Determine great change protein gene expression pretreatment biopsy level patient tumor specimen ( COX-2 overexpressing ) v specimens surround normal tissue ( expect COX-2 overexpressing ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-5 . Patients undergo plan local excision definitive radical resection day 6 . Tumor tissue normal tissue ( least 5 cm away tumor ) sample collect pretreatment . Post-treatment tissue sample collect along surgery . Serum urine sample obtain baseline administration celecoxib . Tumor normal tissue specimen analyze assay measure marker cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) activity ( i.e. , COX-2 mRNA protein , tumor prostaglandin E_2 [ PGE_2 ] , VEGF ) . Tissue sample also assess cDNA microarray image mass spectrometry determine overall change gene protein expression pretreatment level . Surrogate marker COX-2 activity serum ( i.e. , VEGF ) urine ( i.e. , urinary metabolite PGE_2 [ PGE-M ] ) also assess compare change note tumor tissue . COX-2 protein level determine immunohistochemistry patient limited pretreatment tumor tissue specimen .</detailed_description>
