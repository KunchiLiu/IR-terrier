	<brief_summary>The parathyroid gland hormone major impact endocrine control bone metabolism mineralization parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) identify epidemiological report relate adversely mortality . Previously , applicant demonstrate two model dietary cis-9 , trans-11 conjugate linoleic acid ( CLA ) reduce PTH 30 % little 4 week male rat without adversely affect bone density . Both bioactive PTH intact PTH assay use reduce CLA . In one rat model , rat normal PTH sub-group high PTH due chronic renal disease . In second study , rat healthy young male female . Regardless model health state , PTH reduce 30 40 % CLA . Of interest , isoforms CLA trans-10 , cis-12 CLA alone result reduce PTH . The select CLA isomer proven reduce PTH , cis-9 , trans 11 CLA , common food product milk fat beef thus physiologically relevant human diet . The global objective study , first time ; assess effect CLA PTH human , specifically men . Healthy men 19-53 year age select since bone mass reach peak age . Beginning healthy relatively young men important versus age ill individual since effect CLA PTH examine age illness might confound result . Subjects recruit use poster local newspaper advertisements general population . Men ( n=30/group ) healthy weight randomize receive 0 , 1.5 3 g CLA/d period 4 month . At baseline , body weight assess along whole body bone , lean fat mass use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Regional bone mass ( lumbar spine , total hip , femoral neck ) also examine use DXA . A blood sample take fasted state 9:00 10:00 examine PTH , ionize Ca , biomarkers bone metabolism . After 1 month study , measurement repeat end study . Dietary intake monitor along survey possible mild side-effects gastrointestinal discomfort . Data examine use mixed model random ( age , weight , vitamin D status ) fix effect ( diet , time ) post-hoc comparison use Bonferroni correction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS The global objective study , first time ; assess effect CLA PTH human , specifically men . Primary Objectives Hypotheses , healthy men 40 year age determine : 1 . Cis-9 , trans-11 CLA reduces PTH ; a. hypothesize CLA reduce PTH 30 % . 2 . The effect transient ; b. hypothesize PTH fall within 4 week treatment remain stable thereafter 4 month study . 3 . Short-term change bone metabolism accompany reduction PTH follow dietary intake CLA ; c. hypothesize bone resorption reduce indicated resorption marker ratio osteoprotegerin RANKL . Secondary Objective Hypothesis determine : 1 ) Dietary CLA plasma CLA baseline relate bone mass metabolism ; a. hypothesize high dietary intake CLA high plasma CLA associate high bone mineral density ( BMD ) low bone resorption . Experimental Design Methods Population : Healthy men 19 53 year age select since bone mass reach peak age . Beginning healthy relatively young men parallel observation animal study male rat age peak bone mass already achieve ( 5 mo ) . These participant recruit Greater Montreal area ; primarily Macdonald Campus McGill University also announcements make local newspaper ( West Island Gazette ) . All study visit take place Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit , School Dietetics Nutrition ( Directed Dr. Weiler ) . The sample size 90 healthy men ( n=30/group ) base follow inclusion criterion : healthy body weight base body mass index ( 18.5 - 25 kg/m2 per Health Canada ( 50 ) ) , chronic disease , normal bone mass age ( ie Z-score well -1 reference data available ) , vitamin D status within optimal range base serum 25 ( OH ) D ( 50 80 nmol/L serum 25 ( OH ) D median threshold 75 nmol/L set international expert ( 24 ) ) . Vitamin D status inclusion criterion since seasonal change vitamin D status alter PTH . Participants meet entry criterion upon screen must also continue meet entry criterion 1 month later supplementation begin ( see figure 3 flow diagram study time-line year 1 ) . This important related vitamin D status possible interaction PTH . The error vitamin D assay &lt; 10 % . Thus measurement baseline within 10 % screen value enable continuance study . To ensure median threshold maintain , screen set 75 nmol/L 25 ( OH ) D value &gt; 10 nmol/L accepted inception . This accommodate range set optimal vitamin D status thus 65 nmol/L present study . Protocol : In May June 2008 potential participant initially screen telephone health status , self-reported body weight height age . Upon meet criterion ask fast begin even prior screen visit ( 12 h ) include measurement body weight , height bone mass use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) provide whole body regional bone mass ( lumbar spine , total hip , femoral neck ) general health assessment study physician . At visit 5 ml blood sample take 9 10 screen 25 ( OH ) D concentration . It anticipate May-June 25 ( OH ) D within targeted range 50-75 % people screen base data Looker et al US men northern latitude summer mean value 79 nmol/L northern attitude group men 40 49 year age ( 51 ) . Those meeting criterion invite participate trial men randomize receive 0 , 1.5 3 g CLA/d period 4 month begin ~June year ; half sample recruit year enable monthly assessment accompany rapid measurement CLA . Dietary assessment use 24-hour food recall establish typical intake CLA prior baseline sample mailing record week advance , follow supplementation . At baseline , body weight height measure along DXA assessment whole body regional bone mass ( lumbar spine , forearm , total hip , femoral neck ) . A food frequency questionnaire give assess relationship CLA diet , CLA status bone descriptively . A blood sample take fasted state 9:00 10:00 examine PTH , ionize Ca , marker bone metabolism include osteocalcin ( formation ) , osteoprotegerin , RANKL N-telopeptide ( resorption ) CLA plasma red cell membrane . This sampling time accommodate nadir PTH well permit assessment biomarkers bone metabolism standardized time . The measurement ( except DXA ) repeat monthly end study . Dietary intake monitor month use 24-hour food recall prior visit enable clarification person . A survey mild side-effects gastrointestinal discomfort conduct visit along collection supplement take estimate compliance . Since participant fast visit , small snack provide tetra pack milk bagel measurement ( general supply budget ) . Participants ask exercise prior visit since moderately intense activity elevate PTH ( 52 ) . Details Methodology Dietary Supplementation Approach : All supplement placebo double-blinded use letter coding . Only safety officer know treatment group . Each participant take require number placebo and/or CLA capsule lunch dinner meal provide enough one month time . At visit unused capsule recover compliance assessment new supply provide next month study . Participants ask maintain current diet prevent change body weight body composition also ask keep activity constant possible duration study , also keep body weight composition constant well maintain weight bearing activity bone . Diet modify study , rather monitor . At screen assessment , register dietitian ( 3 RDs Dr. Weiler 's training program available provide assessment ) provide participant assessment current usual intake recommendation guide keep diet within recommendation usual intake . Participants instructed amount type snack food permit even prior fast . Of note , calcium intake Montreal men typically close recommendation ~80 % achieve calcium intake recommend level ( 53 , 54 ) . The supplement Clarinol A95 ( Lipid Nutrition ) free fatty acid form 80 % CLA cis-9 , trans-11 form 20 % trans-10 , cis-12 isoform ; purest CLA available . Using supplement study rationalize order follow approach basic study rather food product enrich CLA ; ie , use diet supplemental CLA use rodent study . Each supplement design provide half CLA dosage per meal . In manner 1.5 group capsule contain 0.75 g CLA remain weight comprise placebo olive oil . For 3 g group , CLA capsule contain 1.5 g CLA . The placebo capsule olive oil . Each person ask take one half-dose lunch one half-dose dinner . Dietary Supplement Intake : assessed visit use 24-hour food recall . The data use describe intake population respect total energy , macronutrients ( protein , fat , carbohydrate ) micronutrient ( Ca , P , Zn , Mg , vitamin D ) relate bone PTH metabolism . The food intake day prior blood sampling also important establish possible effect even meal snack prior fast blood sampling . For example snack high calcium participant eat usual intake etc . value PTH could falsely low . The three-day record select well assess intake validate plasma sample measure CLA ( 5 , 56 ) . The dietary intake less impact plasma CLA inception dietary intake CLA necessary assessment demonstrate source dietary CLA quantify total dietary CLA enhance understand plasma CLA value . Sample Procurement : Blood collect visit 9:00 10:00 control diurnal variation permit 3 4 participant see Unit daily . Adverse Effects Safety Monitoring : At visit , participant ask use check-box questionnaire experience illness treat acute illness . Frequency headache , dizziness , constipation , cramp , nausea , vomit , diarrhoea abdominal pain document . Any abnormal value initiate second sampling . Upon confirmation abnormal value , participant ask stop take CLA supplement subsequent blood sample take follow-up visit evaluate return ionize Ca PTH expect value fall intent-to-treat statistical analysis arm study . Blood pressure measure use standard radial cuff sphygmomanometer supine position immediately follow DXA part general health assessment .</detailed_description>
