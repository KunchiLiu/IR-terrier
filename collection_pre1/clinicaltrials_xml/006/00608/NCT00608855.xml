	<brief_title>Percutaneous Cryoablation Treating Patients With Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To confirm safety percutaneous cryoablation palliative treatment patient painful bone metastasis . - To determine benefit cryoablation painful bone metastasis assess pain intensity use standardized Cleeland Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) quality life use standardized SF-8 treatment . - To determine secondary benefit cryoablation painful bone metastasis assess change analgesic use follow therapy . - To determine level anesthesia require cryoablation baseline level conscious sedation plan treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo percutaneous cryoablation one two sit metastatic disease use Endocare Cryocare system . Patients good initial response treatment ( ≥ 2 decrease pain intensity rating Brief Pain Inventory ) develop recurrent pain site new painful site ≥ 1 month initial treatment may undergo one additional cryoablation treatment . Patients complete pain quality life questionnaire periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
