	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) lead good health survival rate among people HIV/AIDS . The purpose study measure effect train partner supervision take medication versus self-administered therapy HIV infect participant . These participant first virologic failure non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based HAART regimen start protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based HAART regimen study entry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor adherence HAART usually associate resistant virus . Poor adherence HAART serious consequence , include limited treatment option HIV infected individual become infected resistant HIV . The purpose study examine effectiveness modify directly observe therapy ( mDOT ) compare effectiveness self-administered therapy ( non-mDOT ) HIV infected individual first virologic failure NNRTI-based HAART regimen start PI-based HAART regimen study entry . mDOT define study daily observation lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) take regular basis . Observation consist mDOT partner present time study participant take observe dose . Half participant study require choose mDOT partner supervise adherence first 24 week study . Each mDOT partner complete study-administered mDOT train program require record observe dos mDOT diary log . All participant partner receive health education study . Adherence measure use Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) cap self-report questionnaire . This study last 52 week . Per protocol , participant stratify accord screen viral load propose study treatment . The study treatment participant receive base treatment history . At entry , participant start one two PI-based HAART regimens , either FTC/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF ) 200/300 mg daily ( QD ) Lopinavir/Ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) 400/100 mg twice day ( BID ) TDF 300 mg QD zidovudine ( ZDV ) 300 mg BID LPV/RTV 400/100 mg BID . mDOT use first 24 week study , follow self-administration study medication week 25 week 52 . ZDV provide study . All enrol participant except one start study regimen initiate FTC/TDF LPV/rtv randomization . No participant start ZDV contain regimen study . Thus , participant study stratified screen HIV-1 RNA . There eight visit study . Medical medication history , blood collection , clinical assessment require visit . A quality life questionnaire adherence tool assessment collect visit . For mDOT arm , medication diary log mDOT partner monitoring review visit . An mDOT exit questionnaire exit interview require end study .</detailed_description>
