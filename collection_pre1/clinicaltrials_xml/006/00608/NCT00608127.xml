	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) chronic , autoimmune , inflammatory disease primarily affect woman childbearing age , associate severe morbidity mortality victim . The exist therapy , however , specific inevitable side effect may fatal . Therefore , widely recognize need , would highly advantageous safe , specific rapidly effective well-defined treatment SLE , devoid disadvantage . We show VRT101 peptide present extracellular laminin target pathogenic lupus autoantibody . Using peptide develop LupusorbTM - immune-adsorption column specifically bind pathogenic antibody monoclonal culture well patient ` plasma . The investigational product name LupusorbTM Column sterile medical device single use classify category IIb ( synthetic ligand , peptide ) accord Annex IX European Medical Device Directive 42/93/EEC . The propose study , pilot non-randomized open label study , test safety , Tolerability short term efficacy single immunoadsorption procedure SLE patient .</brief_summary>
