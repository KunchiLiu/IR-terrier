	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether saline nebulization ( breathe mist moist air mask ) help individual cough well sputum sample test tuberculosis ( TB ) . In addition , study test whether sample obtain saline nebulization well find TB people HIV infection . The study enroll 600 individual , age 12 old , suspect pulmonary TB . Participants ask cough sample sputum container . Then , participant ask breathe mist moist air oxygen mask follow moist salty air , help individual cough second sputum sample . This mist moist air contain salbutamol , medicine help open airway . The sputum sample send laboratory test TB . Additionally , participant test HIV blood sample collection . Participants involve study related procedure 61 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Diagnosis Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early case detection , treatment , prompt household contact investigation , depend rapid microbiological confirmation , direct smear microscopy acid-fast bacillus , patient suspect pulmonary tuberculosis . Since delay diagnosis may result death due lack appropriate therapy , rapid microbiological diagnosis especially critical HIV-infected person . Improved rapid diagnostic method also crucial success epidemiological study ; trial preventative intervention , novel vaccine ; therapeutic intervention , since diagnostic endpoint trial may require microbiological confirmation tuberculosis . In clinical practice , early therapeutic intervention might reduce risk death , especially patient co-infected HIV . In study , researcher propose test simple diagnostic modality rapid diagnosis pulmonary tuberculosis HIV-infected HIV-uninfected adolescent adult . Researchers test whether induced sputum improve diagnostic yield smear positive tuberculosis . This low-cost technology augments spontaneous sputum production inhalation nebulized saline solution . The primary objective study quantify compare diagnostic yield smear positive tuberculosis induce sputum , routine sputum , HIV-infected patient suspect tuberculosis . Researchers believe induce sputum increase diagnostic yield direct smear microscopy patient population . The secondary objective study quantify compare diagnostic yield smear positive tuberculosis induce sputum , routine sputum , patient suspect tuberculosis , regardless HIV status . Researchers believe induce sputum increase diagnostic yield direct smear microscopy patient population , regardless HIV status . Approximately 1200 individual ( male female gender ) , age 12 year old , suspect pulmonary tuberculosis , screen order enroll 600 eligible participant 2 district health service clinics near town Worcester , Western Cape Province , South Africa . Informed consent participation seek adolescent adult suspect pulmonary tuberculosis present public sector community health service investigation . A rapid HIV test , pre- post-test counseling , perform . A routine spontaneous expectorate sputum sample induce sputum sample ( obtain nebulization sterile 5 % saline via mask ) collect . A second routine sputum collect follow morning . Direct smear microscopy mycobacterial culture sputum perform accredited microbiology laboratory . HIV rapid test result use classify participant evaluation primary outcome , positive direct smear microscopy , secondary outcome , positive culture M. tuberculosis . Diagnostic yield routine induce sputum sample calculate , proportion patient culture-positive M. tuberculosis , compare pair-wise sequential manner . Results report difference yield 95 % confidence interval difference proportion . The primary endpoint sputum direct smear microscopy positive acid-fast bacillus . The secondary endpoint sputum culture positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Study duration 4 year individual subject participation approximately 8 week .</detailed_description>
