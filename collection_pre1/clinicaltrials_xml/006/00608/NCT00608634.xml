	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , perillyl alcohol , work different way stop growth abnormal cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know dose topical perillyl alcohol effective stopping development cancer sun damage skin . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study high-dose topical perillyl alcohol see well work compare low-dose topical perillyl alcohol treat patient sun damage skin actinic keratoses .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Perillyl Alcohol Treating Patients With Sun Damaged Skin Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine topical administration perillyl alcohol ( POH ) cream reverse actinic damage evidence normalization quantitative skin histopathology score skin tissue biopsy sample patient moderate severe sun damage . Secondary - To determine topical POH administer safely forearms patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . - Placebo : Patients apply placebo cream topically dorsal forearm twice daily 3 month absence unacceptable toxicity . - Low Dose : Patients apply perillyl alcohol ( POH ) cream ( 0.3 % ) topically dorsal forearm twice daily 3 month absence unacceptable toxicity . - High Dose : Patients apply POH cream ( 0.76 % ) arm II . Patients undergo tissue sample right left dorsal forearm physician-selected representative actinic keratoses ( AK ) baseline completion study therapy . Tissue sample assess change pattern biomarker expression ( i.e. , p53 , apoptosis , c-Fos histopathology ) karyometry . After completion study therapy , patient undergo tissue sample opposite forearm well blood sample collection determine perillyl alcohol ( POH ) level blood biopsy sample . Urine also collect analyzed safety end treatment . Digital photograph forearm hand obtain baseline 3 month study treatment . Optical coherence tomography imaging also perform pre- post-biopsy site quantify effect POH sun damage AK skin . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly .</detailed_description>
