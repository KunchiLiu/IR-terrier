	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Lymphomas That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dasatinib patient vary degree hepatic impairment . II . To estimate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile drug patient vary degree hepatic impairment . III . To assess safety profile dose-limiting toxicity ( ) dasatinib patient vary degree hepatic impairment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe antitumor efficacy associate dasatinib administration patient vary degree hepatic impairment . II . To examine whether pharmacokinetic clearance dasatinib correlate hepatic function assess Child-Pugh Criteria , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Organ Dysfunction Working Group Criteria , assessments liver function . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
