	<brief_title>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) Lymph Node Mapping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) use radioactive tracer scanner record data computer construct two- three-dimensional image . A small amount radioactive drug inject body scanner use make detailed image area inside body radioactive material take cell . Using gamma camera ( special kind scanner ) , create well picture lymph node region . We compare picture image CT scan , help plan therapy . The research study involve see feasible use SPECT scanning procedure purpose plan radiation treatment . We hope allow u accurately precisely plan radiation treatment potential site cancer , avoid deliver much radiation normal</detailed_description>
