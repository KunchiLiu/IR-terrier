	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) diabetes health condition strongly influence person 's diet . Although best diet prevent CVD diabetes uncertain , reduce intake saturate transunsaturated fat know help lower cardiovascular risk . However , even diet low fat vary widely energy provide nutrient , particularly carbohydrates . This study determine effect higher versus lower carbohydrate diet , high low glycemic index ( GI ) composition , risk factor CVD diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A healthy diet remarkable effect person 's overall health . Research consistently confirm association diet serious health problem , include heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure , gastrointestinal disorder . Most healthy diet aim disease prevention promote low intake fat , optimal diet prevent CVD relate disorder uncertain . Recent emphasis turn influence carbohydrate consumption risk CVD diabetes . Carbohydrates comprise wide range food , categorize absorption rate , also know glycemic index ( GI ) . There much current debate level type dietary carbohydrate affect cardiovascular health . This study determine effect higher versus lower carbohydrate diet , high low GI composition , risk factor CVD diabetes . Potential participant attend three screen visit include questionnaire , clinical measurement , blood urine test . Participants undergo 8-day run-in phase become familiar feed pattern four different diet : high carbohydrate high GI , high carbohydrate low GI , low carbohydrate high GI , low carbohydrate low GI . During run-in , participant provide food , snack , calorie-containing beverage . Participants also complete daily food diary , symptom questionnaire , medical social history , daily weigh-in . After meet dietician review progress , eligible participant randomly assign one eight sequence four diet plan . Participants follow four diet plan 5 week , period least 2 week separate plan . During diet period , participant provide food snack beverage . All participant require eat least one on-site meal per day , 5 day per week . Participants keep daily food diary undergo weekly blood pressure measurement first 3 week diet period . Assessments occur fifth week four dieting period include symptom satiety questionnaire , blood pressure measurement , blood draw . One month follow completion last dieting period , participant receive nutritional counseling prevention CVD .</detailed_description>
