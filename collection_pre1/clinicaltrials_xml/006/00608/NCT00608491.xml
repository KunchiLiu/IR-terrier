	<brief_summary>Heart failure serious condition heart 's ability pump blood body impair , often make person feel weak fatigue . When person 's condition worsen point hospitalization , person say acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) . Abnormal kidney function association cardiac distress , know cardiorenal syndrome , common complication heart failure cause medical problem need hospitalization . While various effective treatment heart failure , research need determine best treatment target ADHF cardiorenal syndrome . This study compare safety effectiveness ultrafiltration versus standard medical drug therapy improve renal function relieve fluid buildup people hospitalize ADHF cardiorenal syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Ultrafiltration Treating People With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Cardiorenal Syndrome ( The CARRESS Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure common condition affect approximately 5 million people United States , 550,000 new case diagnose year . Common symptoms heart failure include swell fluid buildup leg , foot , and/or lung ; shortness breath ; cough ; elevate heart rate ; change appetite ; fatigue . If leave untreated , condition heart may deteriorate far person undergoes ADHF . The number hospitalization attribute ADHF risen significantly , many people readmitted soon discharge recur symptom medical complication , cardiorenal syndrome . Current heart failure treatment focus remove excess fluid buildup , often increase urination diuretic medication drain directly vein . Direct drainage vein , also know ultrafiltration , may effective method treat people ADHF cardiorenal syndrome . This study compare safety effectiveness ultrafiltration versus standard medical drug therapy improve renal function relieve fluid buildup people hospitalize ADHF cardiorenal syndrome . Participation study last 60 day . All potential participant undergo initial screening , include medical history , physical exam , blood draw , measurement fluid intake urine output , questionnaire . These evaluation procedure repeat various point hospital stay . Eligible participant randomly assign receive standard medical drug therapy fluid removal ultrafiltration . Standard medical drug therapy involve intravenous delivery diuretic possibly doctor-recommended medication . Ultrafiltration involve intravenously remove blood , pass ultrafiltration device , return blood participant . During ultrafiltration , participant treat blood thinner IV , well . Follow-up assessment occur Days 30 60 treatment . Follow-up assessment include measurement fluid intake , urine output , vital sign ; blood draw ; physical exam ; question medication status recovery .</detailed_description>
