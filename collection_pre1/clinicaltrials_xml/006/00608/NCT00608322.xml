	<detailed_description>Sepsis common devastate disease responsible 215,000 death annually United States lead cause death critically ill patient . Sepsis recognize time-sensitive emergency , patient stand best chance survival effective therapeutic intervention deliver early possible . Early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) , protocol-directed resuscitation strategy target early optimization global hemodynamic parameter , save life . Use EGDT protocol associate large mortality benefit demonstrate sepsis randomize control trial date ; however , sepsis still carry extremely high mortality rate ( ~30 % ) , even effective EGDT . As tissue perfusion sepsis remain markedly impaired despite normalization global hemodynamics , target macrocirculatory goal resuscitation ( e.g . blood pressure , cardiac output ) alone may sufficient . Microcirculatory dysfunction pivotal element pathogenesis sepsis . Microcirculatory dysfunction cause impairment tissue perfusion independent global hemodynamics , hypothesize critical factor development sepsis-induced organ dysfunction , especially early phase sepsis therapy . Orthogonal polarization spectral ( OPS ) videomicroscopy technique permit non-invasive assessment microcirculation human subject . Using OPS technique , increase severity early microcirculatory derangement sepsis patient associate acute multi-organ failure mortality . We recently demonstrate early derangement microcirculatory flow sepsis patient severe non-survivors compare survivor , even application EGDT . Early recognition microcirculatory dysfunction reversal may lead improved outcome . Currently , however , therapy specifically target microcirculation sepsis . Novel strategy go beyond optimization global hemodynamics aim improve microcirculatory blood flow could new frontier sepsis resuscitation . Since early resuscitation phase therapy represent great opportunity impact clinical outcome sepsis , also appear promise window opportunity demonstrate benefit investigate novel therapy . Nitric oxide ( NO ) endogenous molecule essential maintain microcirculatory homeostasis . Nitric oxide becomes especially critical protect microcirculatory patency , integrity , function microcirculation sustains severe insult ( e.g . sepsis ) . Although NO production globally upregulated sepsis , production NO heterogeneous within organ system microcirculatory level . We believe exogenous NO administration may preserve microcirculatory flow sepsis , hypothesize effective therapy augment tissue perfusion . Inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) deliver NO effectively distal microcirculation `` open '' low-flow microcirculatory unit via modulation microvascular tone well anti-adhesive effect microvascular endothelium . Because iNO would expect induce exacerbate arterial hypotension sepsis patient , iNO administration ideal method test hypothesis effect exogenous NO microcirculation sepsis . We hypothesize iNO augment microcirculatory perfusion sepsis resuscitation , increase microcirculatory flow associate improved lactate clearance ( important marker resuscitation effectiveness ) decrease organ failure ( critical patient-oriented outcome measure ) . To test hypothesis , generate two inter-related specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To determine whether iNO augment tissue perfusion sepsis resuscitation . In randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial , evaluate effect iNO compare placebo microcirculatory perfusion index sepsis patient exhibit persistent microcirculatory flow impairment achievement global hemodynamic endpoint resuscitation EGDT . Specific Aim 2 : To determine whether iNO-mediated improvement microcirculatory perfusion sepsis lead effective resuscitation reduction organ failure . In randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial , evaluate effect iNO clinical outcome sepsis patient : [ ( ) increase lactate clearance 0-2 hour , ( b ) decrease Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score 0 24 hour ] .</detailed_description>
