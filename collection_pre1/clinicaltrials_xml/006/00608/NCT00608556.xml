	<brief_summary>This study examine genetic material obtain blood tissue sample patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) heterotaxy ( abnormality left-right positioning organ body , also call situs inversus ) gain well understanding disorder lung disease call primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) . CHD prevalent patient heterotaxy . It believe certain form CHD heterotaxy may genetic origin PCD . Individuals 2 year age old CHD heterotaxy may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Blood test , electrocardiogram ( EGC ) chest x-ray . - Saliva collection : Subjects rinse mouth water , spit approximately 1.5 cc saliva sterile container . - Buccal swab : A small soft , toothbrush-like swab rub inside line cheek collect tissue sample . - Nasal test measure nasal nitric oxide level obtain tissue sample inside nostril : For nitric oxide level test , rubber probe insert one nostrils fit snugly comfortably . The subject take deep breath exhales way mouth plastic device . During exhalation , gas measurement record computer . To obtain tissue sample , device insert nostril scrap gently inside nose . - Echocardiography : This ultrasound test heart use sound wave obtain picture heart . A small wand warm clear gel move around chest obtain image . - Abdominal ultrasound : This ultrasound test heart use sound wave obtain picture abdominal organ . A small wand warm clear gel move around abdomen obtain image ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study elucidate possible role primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) complex congenital heart disease associate heterotaxy . This study arise recent find unexpectedly high incidence ( 40 percent ) complex congenital heart disease together heterotaxy mutant mouse model PCD . These finding suggest heterotaxy arise mutation cause PCD . Consistent , recent clinical research study show patient PCD undiagnosed heterotaxy . However , clinical study ascertain patient diagnose heterotaxy may suffer PCD , focus IRB protocol . These study immediate clinical importance , heterotaxy patient undergoing surgical correction complex structural heart defect become ventilator dependent unknown cause . A diagnosis PCD patient heterotaxy would significantly alter clinical management strategy potential significantly improve outcome heterotaxy patient undergo high-risk cardiac surgery complex congenital heart defect . For study , recruit pediatric subject undergoing surgery complex congenital heart defect associate heterotaxy Children 's National Medical Center . We also recruit adult patient heterotaxy heart disease situs inversus Children 's National Medical Center NIH . In addition , recruit patient , age 2 year old , see NIH Dr. Kenneth Olivier know PCD Kartagener syndrome documentation high clinical suspicion heterotaxy situs inversus study . Subjects evaluate PCD use standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . This include obtain airway epithelial tissue sample assess ciliary motion videomicroscopy assess defect ciliary ultrastructure electron microscopy . In addition , nasal nitric oxide measurement obtain , reduce NO level often associate PCD . All procedure utilize SOPs obtain approve IRB protocol part multi-center study University North Carolina ( Dr. Michael Knowles ) NIH ( Dr. Ken Olivier , NIAID ) . In addition , blood , buccal swab , saliva sample obtain DNA analysis candidate gene know cause heterotaxy and/or PCD . Through study , hope establish whether mutation cause PCD may contribute heterotaxy situs anomaly . Such finding may suggest change standard care heterotaxy patient include evaluation PCD , particularly prior surgery . In addition , DNA analysis may provide novel insight genetic cause complex congenital heart defect associate heterotaxy PCD , allow future development appropriate diagnostic test accurate identification patient risk PCD . Together , outcome study significant impact improve clinical care patient congenital heart disease associate situs anomaly .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients diagnose congenital heart disease , heterotaxy situs inversus ask participate study regardless sex , age , race . In addition , patient diagnose PCD Kartagener syndrome documentation high clinical suspicion heterotaxy situs inversus also recruit participate study . There know ethnic racial predilection heterotaxy , congenital heart disease , situs inversus , PCD , Kartagener syndrome . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Certain condition may preclude specific procedure include protocol , may still allow pertinent part diagnostic evaluation . These conditions/procedures may include : pregnancy/chest radiograph . For reversible condition , acute upper airway infection , significant epistaxis within prior week ( related number 2 ) , low airway infection uncontrollable coughing , participant may need reevaluate resolution . For nasal NO nasal mucosal scraping , follow list absolute contraindication : 1 . Anatomic abnormality nose sinus ( e.g . complete sinus blockage turbinatectomy ) preclude measurement nasal NO . 2 . A severe bleeding diathesis condition , hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome , may predispose significant nasal bleed result severely excoriate nasal mucosa .</criteria>
