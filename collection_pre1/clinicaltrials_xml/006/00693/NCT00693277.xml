	<brief_summary>1 . Research question Can web-based nutritional educational intervention improve phosphorus knowledge control phosphorus intake ? 2 . Experimental design Following enrollment inform consent , subject randomize one two arm ( group1 : usual care ; group 2 : usual care plus Internet-based nutrition module ) . All subject undergo baseline data collection , consist : 1 . Short form test functional health literacy adult : categorizes individual adequate , marginal inadequate health literacy . 2 . Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Knowledge Assessment Tool : address nutritional knowledge CKD . 3 . SF-12 Health Survey version 2 : 12-item measure health relate quality life . 4 . Kidney Disease Self-Management Survey : 58-item Likert scale base theory important self-management chronic disease . 5 . 3-Day Dietary Diaries 6 . Lab work : i. Serum phosphorus , calcium parathyroid hormone level . ii . Circulating endothelial cell , novel marker vascular damage . Following baseline data collection , group 1 continue schedule clinic visit , group 2 spend approximately 30 minute complete web-based nutrition module . After completion module , patient proceed schedule clinic visit . All subject ask return 30-60 day repeat survey information blood work 3 . Major risk subject There potential mild discomfort necessary blood draw , occur twice per subject . 4 . Potential benefit subject Subjects randomize web-based module may receive educational benefit . 5 . Consent procedures Only individual provide consent participate . Upon agree enroll , study coordinator investigator provide subject copy consent form , remain available answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Novel Methods Improving Patient Education Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To examine effect novel , web-based method educate CKD patient patient knowledge dietary intake phosphorus . We compare 2 method educate CKD patient dietary phosphorus intake : 1 . Usual care , consist individualized care/counseling nephrologist . 2 . Usual care , plus review Kidney School ( KS ) Nutrition Module ( see ) . To compare gain phosphorus knowledge 1 month . To compare compliance dietary phosphorus intake , measure mineral metabolism laboratory value ( serum phosphorus , calcium , PTH , calcium-phosphorus product ) 3-day dietary diary . Specific Aim 2 : To determine S-TOFHLA predicts CKD patient ' knowledge compliance recommend dietary phosphorus intake : 1 . To measure health literacy patient undergoing maintenance hemodialysis , use S-TOFHLA . 2 . To assess correlation health literacy knowledge phosphorus . 3 . To assess correlation health literacy compliance CKD dietary phosphorus guideline , measure mineral metabolism laboratory value ( serum phosphorus , calcium , PTH , calcium-phosphorus product ) , dietary phosphate intake , measure 3-day dietary diary . 4 . To assess correlation health literacy compliance CKD dietary phosphorus guideline , follow usual care versus eHealth nutrition intervention . Specific Aim 3 : To determine high dietary phosphorus intake correlate high level CECs . 1 . To measure CEC level patient CKD . 2 . To assess correlation dietary phosphorus intake , serum phosphorus level , CECs patient CKD .</detailed_description>
