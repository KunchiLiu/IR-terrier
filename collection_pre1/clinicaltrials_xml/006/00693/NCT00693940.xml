	<brief_summary>Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) disease fatty build-up , plaque , accumulate artery legs . People low extremity PAD often experience leg pain walking , cause reduce blood flow leg . Regular walk significant benefit people blood flow problem leg , previous study show men woman PAD walk exercise regular basis . A group home-based walk program may help people PAD walk often improve low extremity functioning . This study evaluate effectiveness home-based group mediate cognitive behavioral ( GMCB ) exercise program help people low extremity PAD increase walking frequency improve low leg functioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Group Walking Sessions Increasing Activity People With Peripheral Arterial Disease ( The Group Oriented Arterial Leg Study GOALS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity PAD affect 10 % 15 % people age 65 . A person 's risk PAD increase age also raise smoking diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , heart disease . PAD symptom may include leg pain , foot toe wound , noticeably low temperature lower legs rest body . The specific functional impairment cause PAD symptom associate increased risk disability , nursing home placement , mobility loss , hospitalization , mortality . Supervised exercise rehabilitation program show improve walk ability people PAD . However , people PAD access supervise exercise rehabilitation program cost difficulty travel exercise facility . Home-based exercise program may beneficial supervised program improve low extremity function people PAD , information need support effectiveness at-home rehabilitation . This study compare effectiveness home-based GMCB exercise program versus general health education session help people low extremity PAD increase walking frequency improve low leg functioning . Participation study last 12 month . The primary outcome measure 6 month follow-up . All participant undergo baseline 6-minute walk test treadmill electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . They also provide information physical activity level . Participants assign randomly receive GMCB session health education session . Both group attend weekly session assign treatment 6 month period . During GMCB session , participant ask exercise walk around track . There also group discussion , lead facilitator , help participant find way increase frequency walk exercise home . Each GMCB session last approximately 60 75 minute . Health education session last 60 minute cover health-related topic . After complete approximately 6 month treatment , participant group telephone regularly study coordinator : receive telephone call every week Months 6 9 follow-up monthly Months 9 12 follow-up . Participants ask return follow-up test Month 6 Month 12 ; outcome measure Month 6 high priority .</detailed_description>
