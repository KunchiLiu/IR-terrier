	<detailed_description>Patients TBI require inpatient rehabilitation frequently confuse time admission rehabilitation . Our investigation confusion conduct part TBIMSM clarify nature confusion early recovery TBI . Early confusion ( PTCS ) find complex syndrome characterize disorientation , cognitive impairment , restlessness , decrease level daytime arousal , sleep disturbance , fluctuation symptom , psychotic-type symptom .

These fact indicate need effective management PTCS . Consensus regard optimal treatment cognitive behavioral symptom encounter among patient PTCS exist currently . While many agent try address symptom TBI , investigate systematically . These circumstance indicate need appropriate clinical trial provide guidance clinician medical treatment PTCS . In response , NIDRR-Traumatic Brain Injury Model System Mississippi propose randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial pharmacological treatment PTCS . The agent select clinical trial amantadine , NMDA indirect dopamine agonist . This agent compare placebo response measure efficacy safety . Study hypothesis : Amantadine reduce severity number symptom PTCS .</detailed_description>
