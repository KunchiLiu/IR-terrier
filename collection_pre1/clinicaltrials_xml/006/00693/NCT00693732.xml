	<brief_summary>Visceral somatic hypersensitivity evidence central sensory sensitization occur majority Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) patient . We recently demonstrate abnormal endogenous pain modulation cause sensitization IBS identify underlying dysfunctional neuromatrix use functional MR-imaging ( fMRI ) . Endogenous pain mechanism regulate , fine-tune integrate sensory homeostatic , include neuroendocrine , immune autonomic nervous system process . Specific measure sensitization endogenous pain modulation correlate clinical measure somatic neuropathic pain , suggest usefulness surrogate marker clinical pain outcome . Validation experimental measure surrogate marker IBS would provide considerable advance pathophysiological therapeutic research pharmacoeconomically burdensome disease .</brief_summary>
