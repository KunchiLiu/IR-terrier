	<brief_title>The Incidence Intra-Operative Awareness China Analysis Relevant Factors : Multicentre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The incidence awareness patient undergo general anesthesia report many 0.1～0.2 % western country . But far，medical literature awareness general anesthesia still rare China , small sampled study China show significantly high incidence ( 1.5～6 % ) intra-operative awareness . We believe multicenter , large sample , prospective study would necessary u determine incidence intra-operative awareness China , analysis relevant factor would help u understand incidence awareness China much high western country . Methods : This prospective , nonrandomized descriptive cohort study conduct 25 academic medical center China . 11,197 patient ( age＞12 , intubation LMA anesthesia ) form 25 medical center enrol interview research stuff evaluation awareness 1st 4th day general anesthesia . The structured interview question : ⑴What last thing remember go sleep ? ⑵What first thing remember wake ? ⑶Can remember anything two period ? ⑷Did dream operation ? ⑸What bad thing operation ? An evaluation committee independent research stuff constitute verify data medical center . And incidence intra-operative awareness China determine . General condition detail anesthesia procedure patient also record anesthesia binary logistic regression analysis .</detailed_description>
