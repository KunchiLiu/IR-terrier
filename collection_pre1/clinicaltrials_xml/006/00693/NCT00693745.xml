	<brief_summary>This multi-center prospective pilot clinical study assess utility Triage NGAL Test - alone conjunction Triage BNP test - aid early risk assessment heart-failure-related adverse clinical outcome ( death , readmission , additional emergent outpatient visit ) Day 30 Day 90 patient present acutely decompensated heart failure ( HF ) . Its utility aid early risk assessment renal dysfunction patient acutely decompensated heart failure undergo treatment IV diuretic also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipcalin ( NGAL ) Evaluation Along With B-Type Natriuretic Peptide Acutely Decompensated HF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 200 adult present Emergency Department ( ED ) / hospital acutely decompensated HF enrol . EDTA anti-coagulated blood sample collect measurement blood NGAL level ( use Triage NGAL Test ) point care subject 8 different time point presentation discharge . The result NGAL assessment blind medical team study impact medical management subject . Blood sample unblinded assessment serum creatinine ( analyzed hospital 's laboratory ) whole blood BNP ( analyze Triage BNP Test point-of-care laboratory ) also obtain time point . Dialysis , emergent outpatient visit HF , hospitalization mortality record Day 30 Day 90 . If additional serum creatinine obtain standard care near Day 30 , also record .</detailed_description>
