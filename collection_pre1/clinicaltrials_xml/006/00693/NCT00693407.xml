	<brief_summary>Visceral hypersensitivity evidence central sensory sensitization evident many patient functional disorder functional dyspepsia ( FD ) irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . We recently demonstrate somatic hypersensitivity abnormal endogenous pain modulation IBS , indicate central sensitization crucial mechanism IBS . Endogenous pain mechanism regulate , fine-tune integrate sensory homeostatic , include neuroendocrine , immune , motor autonomic nervous system process . Hitherto , study investigate role endogenous pain modulation FD . Abnormal modulation could explain several symptom complex associate FD provide rationale exploration new treatment . The current study design 1. investigate gastric sensitivity FD patient healthy control gastric capsaicin stimulation 2. ass endogenous pain inhibitory modulation system FD patient healthy control heterotopic stimulation</brief_summary>
