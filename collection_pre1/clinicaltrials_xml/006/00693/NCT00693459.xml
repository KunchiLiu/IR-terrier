	<detailed_description>Historically , surgical hemorrhoidectomy effective eliminate hemorrhoid associate high complication rate post-operative disability . The problem common immediately hemorrhoidectomy severe pain , urinary retention , bleed fecal impaction . The dreaded long term complication anal stricture fecal incontinence . Stricture narrow anal canal hemorrhoidectomy direct result excise much anoderm mucosa . Even circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoid , standard three quadrant hemorrhoidectomy necessary . Mild anal stricture treat Hegar dilator severe stricture require lateral internal sphincterotomy without skin advancement flap . These operation morbid result generally poor . Anal sensation partially impair leading degree incontinence 50 % patient hemorrhoidectomy . Persistent incontinence result aggressive hemorrhoidectomy excise muscle hemorrhoid dissection . The majority long term complication solely dependent surgical technique . The majority hemorrhoidectomies perform today still perform non-specialty surgeon . They rely various instrument surgery perform operation anal canal adequate exposure important instrument anoscope . A variety anoscopes currently available , standard anoscope use hemorrhoidectomy Hill-Ferguson . The Hill-Ferguson crescent shape instrument provide adequate exposure anal canal allows surgeon perform Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy , standard care hemorrhoidectomy country . During procedure elliptical excision begin perianal skin include external internal hemorrhoid end anorectal ring . A full thickness mucosa submucosa excise surgeon dissect superficial internal sphincter muscle . The strip excision wider 1.5 cm currently nothing prevents surgeon exceed limitation take muscle excision . The widely accept Hill-Ferguson Anoscopes provide vast exposure set boundary surgeon perform operation . Over last several decade modification introduce alter contour anoscope attempt reduce complication post-operative stricture incontinence . Furthermore , current anoscopes lack ability outline precise excision path infrequent anorectal surgeon non-specialist community . Recently , Ethicon surgical develop anoscope outline precise path hemorrhoid excision without possibility excision great 1.5 cm anoderm excision . This instrument allow standard care Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy perform alter step operation . The presumed advantage ability instrument guide accurate dissection also decrease overall time take perform hemorrhoidectomy . It test several porcine model . Operative time , tissue excise , evaluation suture line address trial instance bleed excessive tissue excision . The study design prospective feasibility trial . Patients schedule operative excisional hemorrhoidectomy undergo plan procedure accord standard care Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy . The new variable introduce application new anoscope facilitate dissection . Other new anoscope pre-operative , intra-operative , post-operative guideline consistent current standard follow . The primary goal confirm new anoscope permit standard hemorrhoidectomy , obtain phase I data confirm novel anoscope safe efficacious performance Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .</detailed_description>
