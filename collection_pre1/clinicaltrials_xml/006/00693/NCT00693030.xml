	<brief_summary>Increasing lesion complexity percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) warrant use overlap drug-eluting stent . Whether substantial impairment arterial healing observe site overlap preclinical pathologic study persist patient undergo PCI unknown . Consecutive patient long lesion native coronary vessel require stent overlap prospectively randomize receive multiple sirolimus- , paclitaxel polymer-or zotarolimus elute stent versus bare metal stent . The completeness stent strut coverage and/or late malapposition evaluate Optical Coherence Tomography 6 month follow-up</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If overlap drug-eluting stent provide increase vessel toxicity know . Given association delay heal incomplete endothelialization observe animal human autopsy study overlap site unclear patient well multiple DES implant . OCT detecs small degree in-stent neointima accurately IVUS might useful method identify strut coverage and/or malapposition . Patients eligible basis clinical angiographic criterion , randomize ( 2:2:2:1 ) receive multiple TAXUS Libertè™ v Cypher Select™ v Endeavor™ v Libertè BM stent , overlap . Stent implantation do accordingly normal interventional practice . QCA IVUS perform end optimal stent placement per visual judgement ( residual stenosis &lt; 10 % , TIMI 3 flow ) . Stent , lumen size volume well complete stent strut apposal determine IVUS analysis . Clinical follow-up take place 1 month ( ±1 week ) , 6 month ( ±2 week ) 1 year ( ±2 week ) . At 6-months follow-up patient undergo quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) , IVUS Optical Coherence Tomography ( LightLab OCT Imaging M2 , automate pull back flush combination ) assessment . OCT image acquire 15-30 frame per second . Blind corelab quantitative strut strut analysis perform use novel dedicate software 0.5 mm section . The following OCT variable evaluate : number visualize strut per section , mean-max neointimal thickness per section , % strut well appose neointima overlap v non overlap site , % strut without neointima , % strut malapposed , rate &gt; 30 % uncovered struts/total number strut per section .</detailed_description>
