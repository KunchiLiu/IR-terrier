	<brief_title>Studying Patterns , Causes , Control Disease Patients With Lung Cancer North Trent ( England ) Region</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish resource bank high quality genomic plasma DNA tumor serum sample link clinical data obtain detailed family history lifestyle questionnaires patient lung cancer partner first-degree relative genetic epidemiology study lung cancer . Secondary - To study single nucleotide polymorphism candidate lung cancer susceptibility gene genomic DNA sample patient lung cancer partner first-degree relative . - To study genetic change lung cancer plasma DNA sample patient lung cancer partner first-degree relative . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients partner complete detailed , interview-based questionnaire ass environmental risk factor cancer . Information past medical , social , occupational , smoke history well family history , include malignancy diagnose subsequent cause death , collect . First-degree relative patient complete interview-based questionnaire smoking , occupational , cancer history . Relatives patient ' partner complete telephone-administered questionnaire . Medical record patient review obtain information pathological diagnosis laboratory number , date diagnosis , stage disease , performance status , co-morbidities , treatment plan . Medical record partner may also review obtain information incidence smoking-related malignancy ( i.e. , cancer lung , larynx , esophagus , stomach , bladder , head neck ) . Patients partner first-degree relative undergo blood sample collection laboratory study . Previously collect tumor sample obtain patient . Plasma DNA , lymphocyte DNA , tumor DNA analyze polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) identify loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) genomic ( lymphocyte ) DNA tumor plasma DNA . Specific tumor-associated mutation also analyze real-time PCR . Single nucleotide polymorphism study , include common gene polymorphism ( metabolic gene , DNA repair gene , tumor suppressor gene ) , lung cancer family also conduct . A statistical model develop future analysis include correlation genetic alteration DNA isolate tumor plasma , familial aggregation study , genetic analysis study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,000 participant ( 500 patient 1,500 partner first-degree relative [ control ] ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
