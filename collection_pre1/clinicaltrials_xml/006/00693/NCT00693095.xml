	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn immune cell activate multiplied order help body fight tumor cell brain . The safety procedure also study . This procedure , call CMV-autologous lymphocyte transfer CMV-ALT investigational mean approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) still test research study . Autologous lymphocyte transfer ALT mean receive immune cell back ( another donor ) treatment activate grown large number clinical lab . It believe body 's immune ( protection ) system attack tumor cell kill . Immune cell call T-lymphocytes ( T-cells ) recognize special protein surface tumor signal attack fight cancer . In patient advanced cancer , immune system adequately destroy tumor white blood cell T-cells stimulate enough . Before T-cells become active tumor cell , require strong stimulation . There special `` stimulator '' cell body call Dendritic Cells ( DCs ) take protein release cancer cell present piece proteins T lymphocytes create strong stimulation . Dendritic cell take blood `` pulsed '' load genetic material call RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) , stimulate DC change RNA protein call pp65 . This protein produce common virus call Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) 70-80 % u expose lifetime . Recently , find virus present many malignant brain tumor . Brain tumor aggressive , reason yet understand , difficult body attack . The CMV virus target tumor , attack immune system cell , may prevent tumor grow . We find grow immune cell large number blood people evidence prior exposure virus . You therefore test determine pre-existing antibody virus order participate study . We use DCs activate grow immune cell blood large number clinical laboratory . These CMV-specific immune cell , call CMV-ALT , return body become activated . It hop cell seek kill tumor cell express CMV viral protein attack normal cell . The transfer immune cell stimulate immune system call adoptive immunotherapy . We evaluate two dos immune cell study ( Dose 1 Dose 2 ) . Depending enrol study receive either Dose 1 2 . The first six patient enrol study receive Dose 1 ( low dose ) next six patient receive Dose 2 ( high dose ) . We know time either dose effective safer administer test dos . Dose 2 large number immune cell treatment find safe first six patient treat study . In study also see , randomly select patient , give injection DC pulse pp65 RNA skin improve function CMV-ALT treatment . You receive three injection skin either DC use stimulate immune cell clinical laboratory three injection saline ( salt solution ) skin start infusion CMV-ALT . It unknown DC injection beneficial immune cell response compare patient receive DC versus saline injection CMV-ALT . After three injection , blood collect compare response patient receive saline receive DC injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Recovery From Drug-Induced Lymphopenia Using Cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell Adoptive Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six CMV seropositive patient newly-diagnosed GBM randomize receive CMV-ALT ( 3 x 107/Kg ) without vaccine CMV-DCs ( 2 x 107 ) . All patient undergo leukapheresis resection harvest PBLs CMV-ALT CMV-DC generation . Patients receive RT concurrent TMZ standard target dose 75 mg/m2/d . Patients histologically clinically-proven progressive disease radiation , dependent steroid supplement physiologic level time vaccination , unable tolerate TMZ replace . If sufficient CMV-specific T-cells ca n't expand ALT n't meet release criterion , patient replace cell may use offer another DC vaccination study , ATTAC Pro00003877 . Remaining patient receive initial cycle TMZ standard target dose 200mg/m2/d 5 day 3 + 1 week complete RT randomize receive CMV-DCs saline simultaneous CMV-ALT vaccine # 1 . While standard target dose 200mg/m2/d 5 day TMZ treatment recommend , TMZ regimen may adjust discretion treat neuro-oncologist . Patients MRI change consistent pseudoprogression continue TMZ receive CMV-ALT vaccination schedule . Peripheral blood drawn 0 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour , 72 hour , 1 week post vaccine # 1 T-cell kinetics . DCs saline give intradermally divide equally inguinal region . Vaccines # 2 # 3 occur 2 week interval . All patient undergo leukapheresis immunologic monitoring specific assessment baseline antigen-specific cellular humoral immune response . If initial dose CMV-ALT safe combination CMV-DCs safe produce inferior CMV pp65-specific immune response , 3rd cohort patient enrol receive high dose CMV-ALT ( 3 x 108/Kg ) along vaccine CMV-DCs ( 2 x 107 ) . If combination unsafe inferior CMV-ALT give . If CMV-ALT ( 3 x 108/Kg ) safe 4th cohort 3 patient enrolled receive treatment 3rd cohort except T-cells label 111In cultured ex vivo 13C-glucose proliferation , persistence , migration follow peripheral blood sampling , Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) , MRI . After initial 3 vaccine , patient receive subsequent TMZ cycle every 4 week least 6 cycle 12 cycle RT . TMZ give day 1-5 28 day cycle . Patients image bimonthly follow death . This study halt 2 patient cohort 3 experience drug-related Grade IV irreversible Grade III toxicity . As part standard care patient , upon tumor progression , participant may undergo stereotactic biopsy resection . As research procedure consent obtain separately . However , tissue obtain , use confirm tumor progression histologically assess immunologic cell infiltration pp65 antigen escape tumor site . Patients consent biopsy resection also offer intratumoral vaccination CMVpp65 LAMP-loaded , 111In-labeled DCs time surgery determine migrate cervical lymph node .</detailed_description>
