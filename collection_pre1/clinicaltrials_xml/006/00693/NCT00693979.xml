	<brief_title>A Prospective Evaluation Randomized Trial TAXUS Treatment De Novo Coronary Artey Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 1264 subject maximum 100 clinical site part study . This study recruit approximately 30 subject NHC &amp; NUH ( 12 NUH ) period 6 9 month recruitment period . Paclitaxel active ingredient Taxol® , drug originally develop treat cancer . The addition paclitaxel coat stent could improve performance stent prevent re-narrowing treat coronary artery . This re-narrowing call restenosis . Restenosis occur balloon angioplasty placement stent result much cell growth treatment site coronary artery . The TAXUS Element stent investigational device . The term investigational mean stent currently approve commercial use FDA regulatory agency worldwide . The TAXUS Express 2 stent also coronary stent make drug coat Element stent . It approve commercial use FDA regulatory agency worldwide , exception 4.0 mm size , yet approve FDA . However , 4.0 mm size study safety performance clinical trial result trial submit FDA support approval . FDA agree 4.0 mm size may use trial . Paclitaxel select drug coat stent know prevent uncontrolled cell growth contribute narrow artery , interfere ability cell divide multiply . Because property , use drug treatment various type cancer . Cancer patient give paclitaxel solution vein . For study , paclitaxel administer locally wall coronary artery coating stent . Cancer patient receive dose paclitaxel approximately 1100 - 1400 time great dose use coat stent . It highly unlikely level paclitaxel blood would measurable effect anywhere beyond heart .</detailed_description>
