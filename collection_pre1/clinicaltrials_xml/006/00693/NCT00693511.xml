	<brief_summary>The overall goal project examine physiological metabolic effect 16-week circuit-training ( strength training + aerobic activity ) program , without behavioral component utilize motivational interviewing , 45 overweight Latina adolescent girl ( 14-18 year age ) . This 16-week randomize control study examine incremental effect follow 3 intervention group insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion , adiposity , habitual ad libitum physical activity : - Control group ( delay circuit training intervention ; n=15 ) - Circuit training group ( strength + aerobic training ; 2 time per week ; n=15 ) - Circuit training ( ) + weekly motivational interviewing session ( n=15 ) Specific Aim 1 : To examine effect 16-week circuit training program adiposity , insulin dynamic , associate hormone adipocytokines , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscular strength overweight Latina adolescent girl . Hypothesis 1 : Participation circuit-training program result significant improvement physiological metabolic outcome , include : ) body composition measure DEXA , b ) fat distribution measure MRI , c ) adipose tissue hormone ( e.g . leptin , adiponectin , TNF-α ) measure fast blood sample , ) insulin sensitivity secretion measure frequently sample intravenous tolerance test , e ) aerobic fitness measure single stage submaximal treadmill test , f ) increase muscular strength measure repetition maximum . Specific Aim 2 : To examine incremental effect add motivational interviewing session circuit train self-selected ad libitum physical activity 5-hour observational period , habitual physical activity level use 7 day accelerometry , meaning motivation exercise use questionnaire intervention . Hypothesis 2 : The addition motivational interviewing encourage empower participant active outside intervention foster healthy physical activity behavior daily life . Improvements physical activity behavior lead great improvement health outcomes list specific aim 1 compare circuit train alone control group .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>At Risk Overweight Overweight ( age &amp; sexspecific body mass index ≥ 85th percentile base CDC BMI growth chart [ US Department Health Human Services , 2000 ] . There upper BMI limit . In experience , numerous child 99th percentile BMI complete outcome measure , group could benefit greatly participation . Gender &amp; Age : Females grade 9th 12th ( approximately 1418 year age ) . We choose study adolescent pubertal youth likely posse requisite hormonal milieu need elicit physiologically metabolic change response resistance aerobic training . In addition physical activity decline pronounce minority female . By limit study female , retain homogenous group . This eliminate sensitive gender issue relate exercise body image concern , goal setting , motivation behavioral change . To reduce effect menstrual cycle , female test follicular phase , irregular/unpredictable menses study random time . Latino origin four grandparent must Hispanic heritage ( report screening form ) . This approach consistent previous ongoing work . Presently take medication ( ) diagnose syndrome disease could influence physical activity , body composition fat distribution , insulin action . Previously diagnose major illness since birth ( e.g . chronic birth asphyxia , cancer , etc. ) . Children type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes exclude referred physician . Children impair glucose tolerance ( fast glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL fast blood draw ) and/or condition associate insulin resistance ( e.g . acanthosis nigricans , hypertension , dyslipidemia ) eligible , long receive treatment meet eligibility criterion . Children physical , cognitive , psychological disability would prevent participate exercise program . Currently , past 6 month , involve dietary , physical activity weight loss program . Children live far 20 mile away GCRC .</criteria>
