	<detailed_description>A new SSFP base T2 T2* sensitive sequence provide good BOLD contrast use . It develop researcher Stephenson CMR Centre Northwestern University Chicago . Its major advantage previous BOLD sensitive sequence low susceptibility motion artifact . MR image perform commercial 1.5 T Siemens MR scanner ( Siemens Avanto ) . In order obtain homogeneous magnetic field additional surface chest coil use combination body coil . Three short axis view represent basal , mid apical slice set use throughout study . If volunteer move position reason , similar short axis view attempt . In order improve develop MRI sequence technique use arm-cuff model healthy volunteer , use reactive hyperemia , easy image heart . The BOLD-MRI signal intensity forearm assess short , 3 min . last upper arm-cuff occlusion follow reactive hyperemia . Main interest study examination heart healthy volunteer well patient suspect coronary heart disease BOLD-MRI technique . The signal intensity myocardium rest different coronary flow stimulation assess . These stimulus pharmacologic ( adenosine ) well change arterial CO2 O2 pressure . All subject undergo change breathe gas , first examine vascular research laboratory Dr. M. Poulin . There subject familiarized modify end-tidal forcing system ( MEFS ) individual response change breathe gas assess . A complete dry-run breathing protocol perform include 2 capillary blood gas analysis . On second day subject study temperature-controlled MR scanning room Stephenson CMR Centre fast state previous 4 hour . This include refrain caffeine nicotine precede 4 hour . Prior baseline scanning , capillary blood sample finger blood gas , hemoglobin hematocrit analysis . Thereafter , volunteer connect MEFS . A baseline scan perform comprise localization , cine imaging , cross sectional flow measurement coronary sinus ( CS ) BOLD MRI three representative short axis slice . Then intravenous adenosine infusion start . After 3 min . MR scan repeat . After 5 min . rest another baseline record . Then successively carbon dioxide pressure increase two step 40 45 mmHg . After rest period 5 min , another baseline scan perform . Then oxygen partial pressure inspire air reduce 3 step describe follow paragraph inspiratory oxygen partial pressure 45 mmHg achieve . This reflect arterial oxygen saturation approximately 90 , 85 80 % . At step , BOLD MRI ( 3 axial slice ) cross sectional flow measurement CS perform . Following 5 minute rest another baseline scan perform . Throughout experimentation subject connect METFS measure ventilation , blood pressure ( noninvasive ) , heart rate ( electrocardiogram ) arterial oxygen saturation ( pulse oximetry ) . Image-analysis : A region interest drawn around myocardium short axis . The averaged signal intensity assess compare baseline adenosine infusion different level arterial oxygenation carbon dioxide concentration . Additionally , differential analysis subendocardium subepicardium perform . Coronary flow coronary sinus calculate use phase contrast MRI . This technique first describe van Rossum , validate phantom animal study successfully use human patient study . Because relatively small diameter CS , absolute flow value may accurate ; therefore relative change different level hypoxia calculate . End-points : BOLD SI myocardium define averaged signal intensity myocardium . Relative flow change CS baseline .</detailed_description>
