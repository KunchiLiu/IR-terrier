	<brief_summary>Short chain fatty acid ( mainly acetate , propionate butyrate ) produce large intestine bacterial fermentation unabsorbed carbohydrate , dietary fiber . Mainly butyrate important energy source mucosa pivotal role regulation mucosal proliferation , immune function mucosal protection . High fiber diet increase concentration colonic butyrate , often propose one protective mechanism . Furthermore , butyrate enema prove effective treatment ulcerative colitis . In present study direct effect butyrate distal colon study 30 healthy volunteer use rectal enema . The study divide two part , part study different parameter , interfere measure synchronously , therefore , need study separately . A . The effect butyrate enemas colonic permeability ( n=15 ) B . The effect butyrate enemas parameter colonic defense , integrity inflammation ( n=15 ) The effect butyrate study healthy stress colon . This way protective effect butyrate intestinal stress study . Prior main study , two small pilot study carry . In first pilot study retrograde spread rectal enema investigate ( n=2 ) . In second pilot study dose type suitable stressor induce reversible damage intestinal mucosa determine ( n=12 ) .</brief_summary>
