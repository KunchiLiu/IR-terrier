	<brief_summary>Children develop certain problem heart function , specifically heart muscle myocardium . This problem cause many thing specifically infection result myocarditis ( inflammation heart muscle ) dilate cardiomyopathy ( cause many factor include high blood pressure heart attack ) . The body go many process repair injured tissue include use protein cause muscle mass increase call matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . The body also use protein direct MMPs stop increase muscle mass call tissue inhibitory metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) . Currently , publish study explain evaluate relationship MMPs TIMPs myocarditis dilate cardiomyopathy child . The investigator wish perform prospective study serum level proteins regulator child myocarditis and/or dilate cardiomyopathy compare child heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) Tissue Inhibitors Metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) Children With Myocarditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All child present sign symptom myocarditis laboratory finding consistent cardiomyopathy eligible . After prospective consent , subject receive : ( 1 ) complete physical examination , ( 2 ) complete transthoracic echocardiogram well characterize disease process . Follow-up echocardiogram perform 24-72 hour admission protocol discharge hospital . Approximately 2 teaspoon blood drawn : ( 1 ) enrollment , ( 2 ) 24 hour , ( 3 ) 72 hour , ( 4 ) hospital discharge . Those subject receive heart transplant blood drawn time transplantation . For cardiac catheterization muscle biopsy part standard care , also biopsy right ventricle perform . Data collect : Minimum patient demographic data ( age , sex , ethnic origin ) , vital sign , clinical course events/data ( i.e . need dialysis , length stay , surgical time point , etc ) , diagnostic test result ( EKGs , ECHOs , etc ) , significant medical history data , standard care laboratory result . The investigator wish evaluate relationship data patient 's diagnosis , clinical course , serum level MMP TIMP proteinase .</detailed_description>
