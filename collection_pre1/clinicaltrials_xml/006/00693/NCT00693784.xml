	<brief_title>Treatment Symptomatic Lumbar Internal Disc Disruption ( IDD ) With Biostat® Disc Augmentation System : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Biostat Disc Augmentation System combination product combine resorbable biologic product delivery device system use prepare insert biologic material lumbar intervertebral disc . Symptomatic IDD define painful disruption internal architecture lumbar intervertebral disc , appear fissure , crack tear within internal structure disc . Pain arise lumbar disc may perceive pain locate low back ( axial pain ) , also somatic refer pain involve posterior hip , buttock , lateral hip , groin , posterior thigh . The diagnosis symptomatic IDD currently make basis imaging study , physical examination , symptoms alone , must establish meticulously conduct disc provocation study ( provocation discography ) include pressure manometry , identification adjacent normal disc . This treatment study design patient exhibit potential source chronic low back pain advance degenerative disc disease significant loss disc height ( &gt; 33 % ) , spinal stenosis , spondylolisthesis ( see Eligibility Criteria ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1875 ( inclusive ) skeletally mature . Voluntarily sign subject inform consent form agree release medical information purpose study ( HIPAA authorization ) . Physically mentally able comply protocol , include ability read complete require form , willing able adhere followup requirement protocol . Lowback pain least 6 month . Pretreatment baseline lowback pain least 40 mm 100 mm visual analog scale . Referred leg pain , present , noncompressive origin clinical finding radiculopathy . Lowback pain great leg pain ( present ) measure visual analog scale . If bilateral leg pain , back pain great bad leg pain . Lowback pain unresponsive least 6 week nonoperative treatment , may include bed rest , antiinflammatory analgesic medication , chiropractic manipulation , acupuncture , massage , physical therapy homedirected lumbar exercise program . Negative response diagnostic medial branch block facet joint injection . No sustained relief epidural injection corticosteroid . Diagnosis symptomatic lumbar ( L1/L2L5/S1 ) internal disc disruption ( IDD ) , require confirmation discogenic pain one two contiguous level positive provocation discography perform use pressure manometry identification adjacent normal disc . The disc provocation study must precisely demonstrate concordant pain ( &lt; 50 psi opening pressure ) must demonstrate fissure ( ) outer onethird posterior lateral anulus . Cauda equina syndrome . Active malignancy tumor source symptom . Infection plan procedure site active systemic infection . Previous lumbar spine surgery . Previous disc invasive treatment procedure affect level ( ) ( e.g. , intradiscal electrothermal therapy , intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation ) past 12 month intradiscal corticosteroid injection within past 3 month . Evidence prior lumbar vertebral body fracture trauma . Disc bulge/protrusion symptomatic level ( ) &gt; 4 mm . Presence disc extrusion sequestration . Clinical finding lumbosacral motor sensory radiculopathy . Leg pain great lowback pain measure visual analog scale . Lumbar intervertebral foramen stenosis affect level ( ) result significant spinal nerve root compression impingement . Symptomatic central vertebral canal stenosis absolute sagittal vertebral canal diameter &lt; 9mm . Loss disc space height symptomatic level ( ) great onethird adjacent normal disc ( expect height case L5S1 disc ) . Spondylolisthesis ( ≥ Grade 1 ) without spondylolysis symptomatic level ( ) . Lumbar spondylitis undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy . Dynamic instability lumbar flexionextension radiograph . Positive response diagnostic medial branch block facet joint injection . Positive response diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection patient pain sacral region Sustained relief obtain epidural injection corticosteroid . Symptomatic involvement two lumbar disc level . Congenital acquire coagulopathy thrombocytopenia ; currently take anticoagulant , antineoplastic , antiplatelet , thrombocytopeniainducing medication . History unexplained , easy , persistent bruise bleeding , bleed gum , bleed problem experience previous surgical procedure . Aspirin aspirincontaining medication take ≤7 day prior procedure . Significant systemic disease , include unstable angina , autoimmune disease , rheumatoid arthritis , muscular dystrophy . Known suspected hypersensitivity allergy drug component fibrin sealant , include aprotinin , used procedure . History , current psychiatric condition , substance alcohol abuse would potentially interfere subject 's participation study . Ongoing previous participation another drug device clinical study within previous 2 month . Subject know pregnant nursing time enrollment plan become pregnant within planned length followup ( 2 year ) . Body habitus precludes adequate fluoroscopic visualization procedure procedure physically impossible use device . Concomitant condition require daily oral steroid usage 30 day precede 90 day . Pending litigation health care professional , except require insurer condition coverage . Prisoner active military personnel would available followup . Presence ferromagnetic implant would disallow MRI symptomatic disc ( ) . Active pending worker ' compensation claim .</criteria>
