	<brief_summary>Children treat radiation therapy brain tumor risk cognitive problem . These problem typically demonstrate global cognitive measure include measure intellectual functioning ( IQ ) . Identification specific area impairment assist isolate vulnerable brain area develop targeted intervention . In study , assess brain tumor survivor , solid tumor control healthy sibling control use measure work memory ( online maintenance manipulation information ) order identify specific cognitive process may underlie observed decline IQ . We also explore relationship among work memory performance IQ , clinical characteristic specific genetic factor interest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Working Memory Performance Among Childhood Brain Tumor Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional control study brain tumor survivor treat St. Jude conformal radiation therapy . Brain tumor survivor ( n= 50 , solid tumor survivor ( n=40 ) , healthy sibling control ( n= 40 ) evaluate laboratory measure cognitive skill ( work memory , episodic memory estimate IQ ) parental questionnaire ( executive adaptive function ) . We also use buccal ( cheek ) swab gather sample DNA extraction . We hypothesize : brain tumor survivor perform significantly bad solid tumor healthy control measure work memory , work memory correlate significantly IQ , work memory associate parent report executive function specify genotype relate dopamine metabolism associate work memory impairment .</detailed_description>
