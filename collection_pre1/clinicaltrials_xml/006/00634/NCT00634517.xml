	<brief_title>4-Week Study Efficacy , Safety PK Albuterol-HFA Versus Proventil-HFA Pediatric Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist two period : 1 . Run-in Period ( 7-14 day ) : During Run-in Period , subject maintain current inhaled short-acting B2-agonist inhale corticosteroid therapy . All long-acting b-agonists ( LABA ) prohibit replaced short-acting B2-agonist ( Ventolin-HFA ) inhale corticosteroid , minimum 7 day . Such LABA replacement therapy consider violation asthma stability . The current orally inhaled corticosteroid may maintain prescribed dose regimen . All concomitant medication must compliant adjusted restriction washout time limit per Appendix II . Subjects document daily asthma symptom score , treatment regimen , concomitant medication , PEF record , adverse event . 2 . Study Period ( 4 wk ) : During 4-week Study Period , subject randomize one follow 2 double-blinded treatment group : - Treatment T ( Albuterol-HFA , N=24 ) : 216 mcg albuterol sulfate ( equivalent 180 mcg albuterol base ) , oral inhalation , QID ; - Treatment R ( Proventil-HFA , N=24 ) : 216 mcg albuterol sulfate ( equivalent 180 mcg albuterol base ) , oral inhalation , QID . During Study Period , subject document daily asthma symptom score , treatment regimen , concomitant medication , PEF record , adverse event . Three Clinical Visits conduct , measurement treatment efficacy serial spirometry ( Clinical Visit 1 3 ) ; monitor safety compliance ( Clinical Visit 1 , 2 3 ) ; evaluate pharmacokinetic profile part study population ( great equal 6 subject per Arm ) use population PK approach ( PPK ) sparse blood sample regimen ( Clinical Visit 3 ) . STUDY POPULATION Sufficient enrollment plan obtain 48 subject `` Per protocol population '' , 24 Albuterol-HFA ( Arm T ) 24 Proventil-HFA ( Arm R ) . Qualified subject : 1 . Male female patient age 4 - 11 year ( upon screen ) , female patient premenarchal upon Visit-1 . 2 . With documented mild-to-moderate asthma least 6 month prior screen ; 3 . Being able reliably perform spirometric FEV1 test ; 4 . Consent , supervision parent legal guardian , participate study ; 5 . Having baseline force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) 50.0 % -100.0 % predict value screen ( Screening Baseline FEV1 ) ; 6 . Demonstrating great equal 12.0 % FEV1 reversibility Reversibility Test , 30 min inhale 180 mcg Ventolin-HFA ; 7 . Satisfying criterion asthma stability , define significant change asthma therapy asthma-related hospitalization emergency visit , 4 week prior screen ; 8 . Satisfying Run-in Period requirement ; 9 . Satisfying inclusion/exclusion criterion , specify Section 4.2 . TREATMENT REGIMENS Enrolled subject randomize receive one 2 double-blinded treatment : Albuterol-HFA ( Treatment T ) Proventil-HFA ( Treatment R ) . CLINICAL VISITS : The entire study consist Screening Period , Run-in Period , Study Period consist three ( 3 ) Clinical Visits . The three ( 3 ) Clinical Visits schedule 14±3 day interval , Visit 1 ( Day 0 treatment ) , Visit 2 ( Day 14 ) , Visit 3 ( Day 28 ) . The Clinical Visit 1 hold within 7-14 day Screening Visit . Serial FEV1 perform Visit 1 3 . Safety compliance evaluate 3 Visits . Population PK ( PPK ) blood sample conduct Visit 3 . METHODOLOGIES AND SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS 1 . Forced Expiratory Volume 1st Second ( FEV1 ) Spirometry use determine Forced Expiratory Volume 1st second ( FEV1 ) . Patient may choose either stand sit position FEV1 . The position , chosen , keep consistent entire study . Nose clip wear FEV1 measurement . Each FEV1 measure triplicate give test give time point . The high FEV1 volume , triplicate attempt , use representative value . The high second high FEV1 attempt differ great 0.2 L. Up 2 additional attempt may measure necessary , total 3-5 attempt allow give test . The accepted attempt technically conform current spirometry standard American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) . The current clinical normative lung volume conformity ATS guideline use calculate predicted percentage . 2 . Peak Expiratory Flow ( PEF ) Rate PEF measure mean monitor safety asthma control . PEF measure triplicate , additional attempt necessary . The high PEF volume use representative value . Two measurement PEF make daily , prior first AM dose prior last PM dose study drug . Subject stand PEF measurement . No nose-clips need PEF . 2 ) Screening Baseline FEV1 Passing Screening Baseline FEV1 test one prerequisites enrollment , conduct Screening Visit subject . The Screening Baseline FEV1 fall within 50.0 % -100.0 % predict value qualify subject . 3 ) Reversibility FEV1 Test Reversibility FEV1 Test perform Screening Visit . Within 30 min Screening Baseline FEV1 obtain , subject self-administer 180 360 mcg Ventolin-HFA ( 2-4 inhalation ) . To qualify study , subject need demonstrate FEV1 reversibility great equal 12.0 % , ( same-day ) Screening Baseline FEV1 , 3 8 attempt , 30 min inhale Ventolin-HFA . Reversibility define : % Reversibility = [ ( FEV1 postdose ~ FEV1 predose ) /FEV1 predose ] x 100 % Up two-time re-tests Reversibility FEV1 Test allow high attempted reversibility value le 12.0 % great equal 6.0 , deem necessary investigator , screen period extendable total 21 day . 4 ) Serial FEV1 measurement study drug efficacy Response study drug ( T R ) examine serial spirometric measurement FEV1 post-dose . Serial FEV1 conduct follow time point Study Visits 1 3 : 1. baseline ( within 30 minute prior study drug dosing ) . 2. 10 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 minute dose . POPULATION PHARMACOKINETIC ( PPK ) EVALUATION At clinical Visit 3 , sufficient number patient subject population pharmacokinetic ( PPK ) study obtain minimum 6 subject per arm complete correct 4 PK sample . An indwell IV catheter may use , alternative repeat venipuncture , PPK sample . An appropriate anticoagulant may use maintain catheter patency . Four blood sample ( ~5.0 mL ) take hand forearm vein subject , pre-scheduled 4 time point : 2 , 4 , 6 8 hr post-dose ( ±15 min window ) . No inhalation study drug rescue medication take place completion 8-hr PK sampling , unless need rescue , point subject consider evaluable PK endpoint .</detailed_description>
