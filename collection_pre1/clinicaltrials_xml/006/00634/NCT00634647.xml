	<detailed_description>Background : - Satraplatin oral , third-generation platinum analog recently show increase prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) decline rate progression-free survival hormone-resistant prostate cancer . - Satraplatin act bind deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) form intra- interstrand cross link ( DNA adduct ) , result cell-cycle arrest G2 phase eventual apoptosis . One mechanism bring resistance platinum-based chemotherapy removal platinum-DNA adduct DNA repair pathway , call nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) base excision repair ( BER ) pathways . - Polymorphisms DNA repair gene cause impaired NER BER capability recently show cancer , include head neck squamous cell carcinoma , non-small cell lung carcinoma , ovarian carcinoma predict well treatment outcome response platinum treatment . Objectives : - Primary objective single arm study determine presence ERCC1 variant gene polymorphism involve DNA damage repair may associate impact progression-free survival patient metastatic prostate cancer . - Secondary objective study include demonstration biologic effect drug satraplatin patient tumor whenever possible , obtain tissue biopsy white blood cell collection , determine correlation biologic clinical effect PSA progression , evaluate correlation genotype expression , repair pathway clinical event , obtain laboratory correlate include pharmacogenetic analysis prostate cancer patient genotyping use Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) follow either restriction fragment length polymorphism direct sequence genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms ERCC1 , x-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 ( XRCC1 ) , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP1 ) . Eligibility : - Patients metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer . - Had docetaxel-based chemotherapy , 1 previous cytotoxic chemotherapy line . - Good organ function . Design : - Phase II trial single stage design plan accrual 66 patient . - Progression-free survival determine use Fisher 's exact test . - Will treat enrolled patient oral satraplatin 80 mg/m^2 dose day 1-5 every 35-days cycle plus Prednisone 5 mg twice daily every 35 day . - Genotyping perform first 20 patient determine proportion wild-type ERCC1 variant follow 20:80 split .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A . Patients must histopathological confirmation prostate cancer Laboratory Pathology National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Pathology Department National Naval Medical Center Walter Reed Army Medical Center prior enter study . Patients whose pathology specimens available may enrol trial patient clinical course consistent prostate cancer available documentation outside pathology laboratory diagnosis . In case original tissue block archival biopsy material available , effort make material forward research team use correlative study . B . Patients must metastatic progressive androgenindependent prostate cancer . There must radiographic evidence disease ( compute tomography ( CT ) scan bone scan ) primary treatment continue progress despite hormonal agent . Progression require measurable lesion expand , new lesion appear , and/or prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) continue rise successive measurement . Patients must progressive disease receive 1 prior docetaxelbased cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients flutamide prior 6 month must disease progression least 4 week withdrawal . Patients bicalutamide nilutamide must progression least 6 week withdrawal . C. Patients may receive 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . For purpose study , multiple course taxanebased regimen may count single regimen . Multiple course nontaxane agent combination chemotherapy regimen , administer similar fashion may count single regimen . D. Patients must life expectancy 3 month . E. Patients must performance status 0 2 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) criterion . F. Patients must adequate organ function define : Leukocytes great equal 3,000/microl . Absolute Neutrophil Count great equal 1,500/microl . Platelets great equal 100,000/microl . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( Except patient Gilbert 's disease may proceed despite elevated total bilirubin ) . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal . OR Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . G. Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity &lt; = grade 1 returned baseline . H. Hormonal profile : patient undergone bilateral surgical castration must continue suppression testosterone production appropriate usage gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonists . I . Patients must ongoing malignancy require active therapy . J . Patients must able understand sign inform consent form . K. Concurrent use bisphosphonates allow patient previously ; patient bisphosphonates time study enrollment , bisphosphonates may start cycle 2 . L. Patients require hematopoietic growth factor support ( e.g . epogen , darbepoetin ) , myeloid growth factor ( except cycle 1 day 1 clinically indicate ) , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , maintenance medication prior study entry allow continue supportive therapy . M. Results embryofetal development indicate satraplatin consider teratogen woman childbearing potential hazardous respect spermatogenesis men . For reason , men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence ; hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . N. Patients must able swallow capsule . O . Patients chronic stable steroid ( equivalent 10 mg prednisone daily dose ) use noncancer treatment may allow study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A . Patients prior treatment satraplatin platinum contain compound exclude . B . Patients may receive investigational agent . C. Patients know active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . D. History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition satraplatin prednisone . E. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active serious infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit patient compliance study requirement . F. Prior radiation therapy great 30 percent bone marrow , receive strontium89 , rhenium186 , rhenium188 exclude trial . Patients receive prior radiotherapy must recover acute toxicity due radiation . Patients receive samarium153 eligible study samarium significantly reduce halflife compare aforementioned isotope . G. Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient exclude study . H. Patients history major gastrointestinal surgery pathology likely influence absorption oral medication , like bypass surgery , Whipple 's procedure , surgery would impair reliable absorption oral drug .
