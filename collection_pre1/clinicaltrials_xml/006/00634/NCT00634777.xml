	<brief_summary>Patients advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) may benefit organ-preservation treatment base combination chemotherapy radiotherapy without compromise disease-free overall survival . In patient initially advance regional disease , controversy place routine plan lymph node neck dissection chemoradiotherapy , especially respond patient without clinically invade residual lymph node . There uncertainty lymph node status chemoradiation structural imaging modality ( CT , MRI ) lack sensitivity specificity : small positive lymph node detect , residual large lymph node sterilize ( `` ghost node `` sign viable tumor cell histopathology ) . Despite absence evidence base prospective study , numerous institution currently , head neck surgeon quite reluctant operate neck dissection patient complete clinical radiological response follow chemoradiation . Metabolic image tumor use PET glucose analog FDG proven effective head neck SCC , especially treatment differentiate disease progression radiation-induced inflammation.1 Several study show metabolic response could predict presence absence residual tumor cell primary tumor well probability relapse .2-4 Conflicting result report use PET predict pathological nodal status chemoradiation , negative predictive value range 14 % 100 % .5,6 Discrepancies observe might due fact PET perform variable time point end radiotherapy . Ideally , PET perform late possible tumor regrowth begin become detectable , increase sensitivity procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The primary objective ass negative predictive value ( NPV ) PET single examination correctly predict absence remain invaded lymph node chemoradiotherapy advanced HNSCC . Secondary objective include : - The evaluation suitability wait see approach without neck dissection patient consider complete responder ( base clinical evaluation image assessment include PET : diagnosis tool negative consider patient complete responder ) ; suitability estimate use negative predictive value overall assessment complete response include PET-FDG also clinical evaluation imaging . - The evaluation ability PET-FDG correctly predict remain pathologically invade lymph node ( PPV ) chemoradiotherapy advance HNSCC patient postchemoradiation positive PET ( therefore consider less complete regional locoregional response undergo least neck dissection .</detailed_description>
