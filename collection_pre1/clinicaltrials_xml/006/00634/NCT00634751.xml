	<brief_summary>This study involve use oxaliplatin , capecitabine , sorafenib drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treatment different cancer . Their use exact combination consider experimental treatment pancreas biliary tract ; however combination test preliminary trial . We also test survey design . The purpose research study investigate chemotherapy drug sorafenib combination oxaliplatin capecitabine chemotherapy treatment pancreas biliary tract cancers.to help patient report side effect chemotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CO07204-Phase I/II Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine &amp; Sorafenib Advanced Pancreatic &amp; Biliary Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - To assess overall safety sorafenib administer `` 2DOC regimen '' capecitabine oxaliplatin patient advance metastatic pancreas biliary tract cancer . - To define dose limit toxicity maximally tolerate dose combination . - To assess clinical response rate ( stable , partial complete response ) combination patient advance metastatic pancreas biliary tract cancer . Secondary Objectives - To define time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . - To evaluate congruency Adverse Events Self-Report Survey determine patient report side effect treatment</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced inoperable metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas biliary tract previously receive one systemic treatment disease . Age least 18 year old ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : WBC least 3,000 ANC least 1,500 PLT least 100,000 total bilirubin must less 2.5 x institutional upper limit norm AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) must less 5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance must great 50 mL/min calculate CockroftGault formula Patients â‰¤ grade 2 ( CTC 3.0 ) neuropathy . At least one measurable lesion define RECIST criteria The effect oxaliplatin , capecitabine sorafenib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason DNA alkylating agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because risk toxicity nursing infant secondary oxaliplatin treatment mother unknown may harmful , breastfeed discontinue mother treated oxaliplatin . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . No concomitant radiation therapy , systemic cancer therapy . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic toxicity . History allergy platinum compound , capecitabine , sorafenib antiemetic appropriate administration conjunction protocoldirected chemotherapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : ongoing active infection , thrombolic embolic event cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack within past 6 month , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris within 3 month prior entry study , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , ongoing cardiac arrhythmia ( exclude atrial fibrillation ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg , despite optimal medical management ) , pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 week first dose study drug , hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 week first dose study drug , serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture , evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study oxaliplatin , capecitabine sorafenib DNA alkylating agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Female patient reproductive potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within two week prior enrol . Major surgery , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 4 week first study drug . Because drug interaction sorafenib , use St. John 's Wort rifampin ( rifampicin ) contraindicate . Patients may discontinue use drug become eligible study Any condition impair patient 's ability swallow whole pill . HIVpositive patient receive antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction . Second malignancy within past 3 year ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cancer ) treat curative intent currently without evidence disease , Patients know gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome exclude concurrent illness affect absorption oral medication .</criteria>
