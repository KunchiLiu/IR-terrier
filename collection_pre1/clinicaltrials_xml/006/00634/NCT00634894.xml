	<brief_title>Femara ( Letrozole ) Versus Placebo Patients With Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THE STUDY DRUG : Letrozole design block enzyme make estrogen post-menopausal woman . By interfere production estrogen make enzyme , letrozole decrease total amount estrogen body . As result , less estrogen reach cancer cell , may prevent growth . SCREENING TESTS : Before begin take study drug study , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test tumor marker . - You chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan check status disease . - Your previously collect tumor tissue , available , test learn estrogen receptor positive negative . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . STUDY GROUPS : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . Group 1 take letrozole . Group 2 take placebo . A placebo substance look like study drug active ingredient . Neither doctor know group . However , need safety , study staff study doctor able find group . STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION : You take letrozole placebo mouth 1 time every day 12-week study `` cycle '' . It take around time every day take without food and/or water . You give amount study drug/placebo need 1 cycle therapy time . You keep drug `` diary '' study . In diary list much study drug/placebo take . This diary review cycle . STUDY VISITS : Within 4 week first dose study drug/placebo , bone scan test bone watch sign osteoporosis ( weaken bone ) cause decrease estrogen level . You separately consent bone scan , describe procedure risk detail . Every 12 week , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test tumor marker . - You CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask experienced side effect . Every 6 month , chest x-ray . Every year , bone scan check osteoporosis . LENGTH OF STUDY : You may remain study long experience intolerable side effect disease gotten bad . In case , take study . The total length study five ( 5 ) year . At end study , still active treatment , doctor may may decide continue treatment off-study . END-OF-STUDY VISIT : On last day take study drug/placebo , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test tumor marker . - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign weight . - You MRI scan CT scan check status disease . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask experienced side effect . This investigational study . Letrozole commercially available FDA approve treatment type breast cancer . Its use patient ovarian cancer experimental . While study , letrozole placebo provide cost . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients optimally debulked ( &lt; 1 cm residual disease ) stage IIAIIIC ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer achieve complete clinical response ( CR ) firstline surgery chemotherapy . 2 . All patient must appropriate surgery appropriate tissue available histologic evaluation confirm diagnosis stage . 3 . Patients must complete primary treatment within past 8 week receive least 5 cycle 8 cycle platinum ( IV IP ) paclitaxel docetaxelbased combination chemotherapy . Patients must symptoms suggestive persistent cancer . 4 . Patient must CT MRI scan abdomen/pelvis evidence metastatic disease normal CA125 ( &lt; 35 Units/mL ) follow primary therapy . 5 . Patients willing sign inform consent participate study 5 year first recurrence . 1 . Patients evidence metastatic disease completion surgery first line chemotherapy 2 . Patients low grade ovarian cancer histology . 3 . If chemotherapy initiate great 8 week primary surgery complete 8 week prior treatment start . 4 . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . 5 . Patients take form HRT and/or CAM product ( i.e . phytoestrogens , etc . ) 6 . Patients history prothrombic clotting disorder ( i.e PE DVT ) . 7 . Patients history malignant disease within past 10 year except squamous basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , adequately cone biopsied 8 . Patients severe concomitant disease would place patient unusual risk confound result trial .</criteria>
