	<brief_summary>This clinical study evaluate establish protective effect Amphastar 's Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhalation Aerosol ( Albuterol-HFA ) , prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) adolescent adult asthmatic patient , comparison ( 1 ) Proventil®-HFA ( Reference drug Active Control ) , ( 2 ) Placebo-HFA control ( HFA propellant ) . Safety test drug , Albuterol-HFA , also evaluate comparison Active Placebo Controls . Analyses perform determine Armstrong 's Albuterol-HFA result significant bronchoprotective effect , attenuate Max % Fall FEV1 , comparison Placebo-HFA control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-Dose Cross-Over Study Effects Albuterol-HFA Exercise Induced Bronchoconstriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) report around 70 % 75 % among patient clinically establish asthma . Airway cool dry think cause release inflammatory mediator , histamine leukotrienes , mediate clinical EIB symptom . Pretreatment variety medication ameliorate EIB . Albuterol find effective minimizing EIB theophylline , ipratropiom , cromoglycate , etc . Tested use treadmill exercise challenge , new formulation albuterol MDI HFA propellant demonstrate effective CFC propellant protect asthma patient EIB child adults . As part Amphastar Pharmaceuticals ' clinical development plan , current study examines clinical efficacy A004 , Armstrong Pharmaceuticals ' Albuterol HFA oral inhalation MDI , prevent EIB adolescent adult asthmatic patient . This randomized , double-blind , active placebo-controlled , three-treatment , cross-over study , conduct adolescent adult patient mild moderate asthma demonstrable EIB . All subject screen inclusion/exclusion criterion enrollment . A computer-generated randomization code create Amphastar Pharmaceuticals ' IT Department , enrol subject receive three double-blinded treatment randomize sequence . Each treatment follow standardized exercise challenge series FEV1 measurements 90 min post-exercise period . The three crossover Treatment Arms : - Treatment T ( Armstrong 's Test Drug : Albuterol-HFA ) ; - Treatment R ( Reference Drug Active Control : Proventil®-HFA ) ; - Treatment P ( Placebo-HFA ) . By definition crossover design , three Treatment Arms expect consist comparably 24 evaluable subject . The consecutive study session separate interval 1-14 day .</detailed_description>
