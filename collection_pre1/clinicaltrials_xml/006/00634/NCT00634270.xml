	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT/SCHEMA Sirolimus provide oral solution 1 mg/ml allow precise dose adjustment . The tablet oral solution form clinically equivalent ( 2003 ) . Sirolimus administer orally twice daily ( approximately every 12 hour ) 28 day course rest period course . Sirolimus take patient consistently either without food . Sirolimus NOT take grapefruit juice effector CYP3A4 ( see section 4.1.7 ) . Dietary habit around time sirolimus intake consistent possible throughout study , particular , period sample take pharmacokinetic analysis ( applicable ) . Limited exposure sunlight wear sunscreen recommend take drug . If miss dose , treatment continue without make miss dose . The start dose 0.8 mg/m2 BSA per dose . Each patient 's dose round near 0.1 mg ( adult average 1.6 mg per dose ) . The BSA calculate base accurate height weight measurement perform accord institutional guideline , use follow formula : Square root : ( Height [ cm ] X Weight [ kg ] /3,600 ) Dosing pharmacokinetically adjust maintain trough sirolimus level within target range 10-15 ng/ml . ( Appendix IV-A ) . The first sirolimus level measure week 2 allow load occur approach steady state concentration . If patient unable achieve target trough sirolimus level within 4 week , patient may ask mini-pharmacokinetics 3 blood draw , addition trough level , order well estimate patient 's dose . The extra trough sirolimus level : 1 hour , 3 hour , 4-6 hour sirolimus dose . Sirolimus dose adjust pharmacokinetically account change body surface area . Dose modification patient experience toxicity outline Section 8.0 . Sirolimus re-taken vomiting occurs within 15 minute take dose , vomit occurs 15 minute take sirolimus . Patients parents/guardians keep diary document intake dose sirolimus potential side effect . The patient diary review patient 's family require clinical study evaluation . In addition , leftover study medication collect study evaluation , drug account time ( Appendix V ) . A treatment course consist 4 week therapy . For stratum 1 treatment may continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . Patients enter stratum 2 may receive maximum 6 course ( i.e . 24 week ) therapy unless evidence objective radiographic response , define Section 13.0 ( &gt; 20 % decrease PN volume ) , tumor progression , unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity disease progression remove treatment sirolimus . Patients document radiographic response may continue treatment sirolimus 6 treatment course maximum response . Background - Patients Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system , include plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , benign nerve sheath tumor among debilitate complication NF1 . Plexiform neurofibromas appear fast growth rate young child . There standard treatment option PN surgery , often difficult due extensive growth invasion surround tissue . - Mammalian Target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , serine/threonine kinase regulate phosphoinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) , act master switch cellular catabolism anabolism control protein translation , angiogenesis , cell motility , proliferation . - The NF1 tumor suppressor , neurofibromin , regulate mTOR pathway activity , increase mTOR activation observe NF1-deficient cell tumor NF1 patient . - Sirolimus macrolide antibiotic inhibits mTOR activity , prevent phosphorylation ( activation ) p70S6K , 4E-BP1 , proteins involve cell motility , angiogenesis , cell growth control . Primary Objectives • To determine whether mTOR inhibitor sirolimus , administer use pharmacokinetically-guided dosing : Increases time disease progression base volumetric MRI measurement child adult neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) progressive plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) . Results objective radiographic response base volumetric MRI measurement child adult NF1 inoperable PN absence document radiographic progression trial entry . - To evaluate feasibility toxicity chronic sirolimus administration patient population . - To characterize pharmacokinetic profile ( profile include pharmacodynamics pharmacogenetics ) sirolimus administer patient population . Eligibility - Patients ≥ 3 year old NF1 AND - Inoperable , measurable , radiographically PROGRESSIVE PN potential cause significant morbidity . OR • Inoperable , measurable PN WITHOUT document progression potential cause significant morbidity . Design - Sirolimus oral solution administer orally BID continuous dose schedule ( 28 day = 1 treatment course ) pharmacokinetically-guided dosing . - Disease status evaluate use volumetric MRI analysis regular interval . - The plasma pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics sirolimus evaluate , pharmacogenetic polymorphism influence metabolism sirolimus patient population . - Pain reduction quality life outcome also assess . - Toxicity chronic sirolimus administer evaluated use physical laboratory evaluation . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN SCHEMA GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ( SCIENTIFIC AIMS ) Primary Aims To determine whether mTOR inhibitor sirolimus , administer orally twice daily continuous dose schedule ( 1 course = 28 day ) use pharmacokinetically-guided dosing : Increases time disease progression base volumetric MRI measurement child young adult neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) inoperable progressive plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , To evaluate feasibility toxicity chronic sirolimus administration patient population . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile sirolimus administer patient population . Secondary Aims To evaluate quality life treatment sirolimus ass preliminary correlation response quality-of-life outcome . To evaluate effect sirolimus clinical response reduction pain , improvement function performance scale .</detailed_description>
