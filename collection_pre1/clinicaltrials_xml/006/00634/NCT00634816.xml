	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density Adult Survivors Solid Pediatric Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific subgroup child survive treatment childhood malignancy show develop relative osteopenia follow chemotherapy felt risk develop osteoporosis later life due inability reach peak bone mass childhood . However , currently , conclusive evidence survivor pediatric solid malignancy risk problem due small number patient analyze . Our SUNY Upstate Medical University Pediatric Oncology Long-term Follow-up Clinic recently establish coalition upstate New York cancer center allow access large number patient . The purpose perform cross-sectional study bone mineral density use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) adult survivor solid pediatric tumor . The primary hypothesis pediatric solid cancer survivor demonstrate significantly low bone mineral density ( BMD ) compare establish age group control . Identification patient high risk development osteoporosis allow clinical trial use novel establish agent . This study ongoing 5 year . To date problem conduct study . A total 38 subject enrol . Analysis research date reveals solid tumor survivor increase risk early osteopenia/osteoporosis . No subject withdraw exclude reason inclusion/exclusion criterion since inception study . The study ongoing recruitment subject analysis . There one amendment make protocol . The amendment increase upper age subject 40 year . This amendment make due although multivariate analysis show relationship number chemotherapy drug , statistical power examine accord multiple variable , individual diagnosis , limit relatively small number patient . An article submit Journal Pediatric Hematology Oncology print May 2005 issue .</detailed_description>
