	<brief_summary>Assessment segmental spine motion continue , difficult clinical problem . Errors 10 degree simple measurement flexion , extension side bend record use conventional radiograph ( xrays . ) These error usually associate inability acquire three-dimensional position inaccurate reference point . It , therefore , extremely difficult measure small change vertebral alignment , may prove early , clinically significant , indicator potential problem . Radiostereometric Analysis , RSA , accurate vivo measurement technique use two simultaneous radiograph . It provide researcher three dimensional motion analysis look routine flexion/extension , also rotational translational change . The measurement accuracy offer technique far exceed manual technique currently use . The purpose study ass amount motion lumbar spine patient AST Stabilimax BAR . The AST Stabilimax BAR design allow motion spine provide necessary stability spinal segment . The amount degree motion currently unknown clinically . By use tantalum bead marker place spine time surgery , RSA analysis determine amount degree motion implant construct . Two question examine data : 1 ) amount sagittal coronal plane motion occur vivo AST Stabilimax BAR system ? 2 ) change 2 year time frame study ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Biomechanical Assessment AST Stabilimax BAR Using Radiostereometric Analysis ( RSA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiostereometric Analysis , RSA , accurate vivo measurement technique use two simultaneous radiograph . It provide researcher three dimensional motion analysis look routine flexion/extension , also rotational translational change . The measurement accuracy offer technique far exceed manual technique currently use . Utilization RSA technology IHP United States infancy . The investigator place much effort past 2-3 year put necessary dedicated resource personnel place . This collaborative effort Department Orthopedic Surgery Imaging Core IHP . Preliminary work accuracy , reliability , surgical planning use RSA complete presented national conference . The purpose study ass amount motion lumbar spine patient AST Stabilimax BAR . The AST Stabilimax BAR design allow motion spine provide necessary stability spinal segment . The amount degree motion currently unknown clinically , biomechanically test vitro . By use tantalum bead marker place spine time surgery , RSA analysis determine amount degree motion implant provide . Two question examine data : 1 ) amount sagittal coronal plane motion occur vivo AST Stabilimax BAR system ? 2 ) change 2 year time frame study ?</detailed_description>
