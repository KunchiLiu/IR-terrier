	<brief_title>The Effects Inspiratory Muscle Plus Aerobic Training Compare Aerobic Training Alone Heart Failure Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sample comprising least 30 individual necessary . These subject randomize two group , one consist inspiratory muscle training plus aerobic training , whereas consist aerobic training alone . This prospective , randomize , control trial include patient diagnosis chronic heart failure attributable leave ventricular systolic dysfunction recruit Heart Failure Clinic . Entry criterion study previous history symptomatic heart failure cause left ventricular systolic dysfunction , inspiratory muscle weakness ( PImax &lt; 70 % predict ) , clinical stability , include change medication past three month . Exclusion criterion unstable angina , myocardial infarction , cardiac surgery within previous three month , chronic metabolic , orthopedic , infectious disease , treatment steroid , hormone , cancer chemotherapy , history exercise-induced asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease smoker recruit . The protocol approve Committee Ethics Research Hospital de Clinics de Porto Alegre Iju√≠ University subject require sign inform consent form . Variables measure strength endurance ( progressive constant load ) , 6-min walk test , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , quality life questionnaire , evaluation heart rate variability sleep apnea . The inspiratory muscle training plus aerobic training consist cycle exercise ( 3 sessions/week ) inspiratory exercise use Threshold equipment 30 min , 7 time per week , whereas aerobic train group perform cycle exercise . Both treatment last 12 week .</detailed_description>
