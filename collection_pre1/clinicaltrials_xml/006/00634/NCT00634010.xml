	<brief_summary>Primary Aims : - To determine whether methadone use first line strong opioid superior morphine evidence reduced pain 12-week treatment period patient advanced cancer . Previous study demonstrate consistent improvement pain control opioid rotation morphine methadone . In addition , pilot study show trend towards low pain intensity methadone use first line opioid compare morphine . Researchers postulate due superior analgesic effect , methadone result well pain control time compare morphine . - To determine whether methadone use first line strong opioid superior morphine evidence reduced frequency neurotoxicity , dose escalation treatment failure 12-week treatment period . Previous study demonstrate patient develop increase pain neurotoxicity chronic use morphine require frequent opioid escalation . Researchers postulate methadone demonstrate lower opioid induced neurotoxicity , less frequent dose escalation less treatment failure 12-week treatment period compare morphine . Secondary Aim : -To perform economic evaluation , compare cost clinical benefit methadone morphine . Researchers perform evaluation incorporate treatment potential `` downstream '' cost , well examination clinical benefit incorporate preference , perform appropriate economic comparison . We postulate methadone associate cost cheap morphine . However , one strategy expensive clinically superior , researcher prepare perform incremental cost-effectiveness analysis . In case , researcher expect show great pharmaceutical cost involve morphine make use cost-effective strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morphine Versus Methadone As First Line Strong Opioid Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DRUGS : MORPHINE recommend first choice strong pain killer World Health Organization Pain Relief Guidelines . METHADONE recommend second choice strong pain killer . SCREENING TESTS : Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform : - You ask level pain . - You ask pain killer currently take . - You ask history allergy . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check kidney function . STUDY GROUPS : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 treatment group . Group 1 receive morphine on-study . Group 2 receive methadone . You equal chance place either group . Neither study staff know study drug receiving . However , need safety , study staff study doctor able find study drug receiving . STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION : If Group 1 , take 1 morphine capsule every 12 hour water . If Group 2 , take 1 methadone capsule every 12 hour . Morphine methadone swallow whole . You give additional capsule another bottle take excessive pain . The additional capsule take every 2 hour , need . If need 3 additional dos 24 hour , contact study staff . STUDY VISITS : You return clinic end Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 questionnaire pain level , ability sleep , constipation , side effect , quality-of-life . You complete 6 questionnaire Weeks 1 , 2 , 6 , 10 , 11 visit . You complete 11 questionnaire Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 visit . Each questionnaire take 1-3 minute complete . The visit research nurse last 45 minute 1 hour . Your study drug supply also check . You also ask overall health , non-health care question , activity level . At visit , receive new prescription 2-week supply study drug . PATIENT DIARY : You give patient diary booklet start take study drug . You ask record take study drug , medication may take , side effect experience . You fill patient diary day . It take less 2 minute complete . For first week treatment , contact research nurse every day either person ( hospital ) phone check pain , side effect , number pill take . You allow take medication , medication constipation , nausea , drug study . All change medication either symptoms complication must record research nurse study visit . LENGTH OF STUDY : After visit end Week 12 , off-study . You take off-study early pain get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Both morphine methadone FDA approve commercially available . You tell study drug receiving . Up 250 patient take part study . Up 200 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
