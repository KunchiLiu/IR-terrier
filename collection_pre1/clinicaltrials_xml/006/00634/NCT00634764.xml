	<brief_summary>Obesity significant health issue United States 30 % US population consider obese define body mass index 30 kg/m2 . Obesity associate long term health complication include diabetes cardiovascular disorder . During pregnancy , obesity associate increase risk fetal macrosomia birth injury , well increase risk gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , cesarean birth , preterm birth . The intrauterine environment purport influence early childhood lifelong risk obesity metabolic syndrome ( obesity , hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance [ IR ] ) . The Institute Medicine guideline maternal weight gain pregnancy provide estimate population goal , may inadequate individual patient need . Other factor , degree maternal IR rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) may predictive actual nutritional need pregnancy . A good determination caloric exercise need may allow development specific dietary recommendation pregnancy . Optimal nutrition result improve maternal neonatal outcome . As intrauterine environment may important impact neonatal childhood metabolic cardiovascular outcome , creation favorable intrauterine environment optimal maternal nutritional exercise guideline may reduce well document problem fetal macrosomia , birth injury , cesarean delivery , later predisposition toward childhood obesity . The goal pilot trial therefore correlate maternal rest metabolic rate , dietary characteristic , insulin resistance level fetal birth weight body composition effort determine factor associate excessive fat mass neonate , place increase lifetime risk obesity . We hypothesize woman low rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) first trim demonstrate great maternal weight gain , adjust caloric intake activity . It also hypothesize give RMR , degree maternal insulin resistance ( IR ) predict birthweight adjust give caloric intake . A third hypothesis woman increase insulin resistance ( measure HOMA ) result neonate large birth weight great degree neonatal fat mass measure DEXA scan , adjust RMR diet characteristic .</brief_summary>
