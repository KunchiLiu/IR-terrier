	<brief_summary>Neutropenia , condition characterize abnormally low number infection-fighting white blood cell call neutrophil , commonly develop people undergone chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation . The severely reduced immunity neutropenia put risk entry life-threatening infection , make implementation treatment increase white blood cell number important . Several study show transfusion donor granulocyte , type white blood cell include neutrophil , effective promoting recovery adequate number granulocyte . However , granulocyte transfusion cause side effect , know whether success therapy outweigh health risk side effect . This study evaluate safety effectiveness granulocyte transfusion treat people bacterial fungal infection neutropenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Granulocyte Transfusions Resolving Infection People With Neutropenia ( The RING Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thousands people year hospitalize neutropenia , continue cause substantial morbidity mortality affect . Neutropenia primarily cause chemotherapy various cancer treatment , radiation therapy , biotherapy , HSC transplantation . Signs symptom neutropenia may include high fever , chill , sore throat , diarrhea . In neutropenia , number neutrophil , type granulocyte , greatly reduce , weaken body 's immune system increase risk infection . Therefore , method provide adequate number functional granulocyte people neutropenia could greatest benefit recovery . Administration combination two drug , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) dexamethasone , show stimulate body produce large number granulocyte . Granulocyte transfusion obtain donor receive two drug may help people low white blood cell count fight infection white blood cell count recover . However , clear whether benefit granulocyte transfusion outweigh risk side effect . This study compare safety effectiveness granulocyte transfusion standard antimicrobial therapy versus safety effectiveness standard antimicrobial therapy alone increase granulocyte number improve survival rate people bacterial fungal infection neutropenia . Participation research portion study last 3 month . All participant previously receive treatment standard antimicrobial therapy begin therapy immediately upon study entry . Participants assign randomly receive either granulocyte transfusion plus continued antimicrobial therapy continue antimicrobial therapy alone . All participant monitor maximum 42 day , provide information medical history ongoing status antimicrobial therapy . Daily blood sample measure white blood cell count obtain participant sample show participant make granulocyte . Samples collect weekly Day 42 . There may additional blood draw depend type infection present participant . Granulocyte transfusion give daily 42-day treatment period , depend granulocyte donor availability . Blood count check immediately transfusion measure granulocyte level . Transfusions stop participant start make granulocyte , experience serious side effect , show reduction infection . At Month 3 study entry , follow-up information collect participant ' health status review medical record contact physician . Participation granulocyte donor last 1 week time donation . Community donor may provide one granulocyte donation , one donation every 3 day . Frequency donation family member accord local blood bank criterion approval blood bank physician . Both community donor family donor limit eight donation year . Twelve hour donation , participant inject Neupogen , contain G-CSF , take one dose dexamethasone mouth . Participants undergo blood draw , follow procedure use apheresis machine granulocyte collection . The procedure last 3 4 hour involve draw blood arm , separation granulocyte red blood cell plasma machine , return red blood cell plasma participant .</detailed_description>
