	<brief_summary>Antihypertensive drug treatment effective 50 % patient . One mechanism responsible treatment failure drug relate stimulation renin-angiotension-aldosterone-system ( RAAS ) . Several class medication treat hypertension block RAAS system develop . However , kidney responds drug treatment produce great amount renin . This high level renin reduce effectiveness medication , ultimately cause blood pressure rise . This one reason blood pressure difficult control certain percentage patient . The hypothesis test propose study beta-adrenergic blockade ( β-blockade ) , superimpose upon aliskiren , drug competitively inhibit plasma renin activity ( PRA ) stimulate release renin kidney ( plasma renin concentration [ PRC ] ) , suppress reactive increase PRC occur aliskiren monotherapy . The primary aim study measure plasma renin concentration ( PRC ) plasma renin activity ( PRA ) level renin inhibition aliskiren combine renin inhibition/β-blocker treatment determine whether addition β-blocker attenuates rise plasma renin concentration ( PRC ) . A secondary aim determine whether combined treatment suppresses PRA blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) play central role maintenance normal blood pressure ( BP ) homeostasis . Derangements regulation system , predominantly due failure appropriately suppress renin secretion kidney , contribute pathogenesis hypertension cardiovascular , renal cerebrovascular complication . Several class antihypertensive medication interrupt RAAS develop . These include agent block angiotensin II ( Ang II ) bind AT1 receptor ( Ang II receptor blocker [ ARB ] ) , inhibit conversion Ang I Ang II ( angiotensin convert enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitor ) , suppress renal secretion renin ( beta-adrenergic receptor blocker ) . These agent effectively low BP , particularly hypertensive patient unsuppressed plasma renin activity ( PRA ) level , significantly improve survival cardiovascular disease PRA level often elevate ( e.g. , heart failure , myocardial infarction ) . Renin secretion regulate , part , feedback inhibition due Ang II bind juxtaglomerular cell ( JG ) . Interruption Ang II generation receptor bind treatment ACE inhibitor ARB , respectively , stimulate renin secretion feedback inhibition attenuate renal perfusion pressure reduce . The consequent , reactive rise PRA occur treatment drug limit antihypertensive efficacy Ang I subsequently , Ang II level increase . These observation reinforce theoretical practical importance pharmacologic suppression renin secretion prevent reactive rise PRA occur treatment ACE inhibitor ARBs . β-blockers suppress renin secretion inhibit β1-adrenergic receptor locate JG cell . PRA Ang II level highly correlate decrease commensurately treatment β-blocker . Aliskiren orally active , non-peptide renin inhibitor . Its antihypertensive efficacy due competitive antagonism renin-mediated conversion angiotensinogen Ang I . During aliskiren treatment , PRA Ang II level decrease significantly . Unlike β-blockade , PRA level decrease consequence reduce renal secretion renin , aliskiren treatment decrease PRA response direct , competitive inhibition renin . Although PRA decrease , aliskiren-mediated decrease plasma Ang II level stimulate renal renin secretion . Therefore , although aliskiren β-blockers decrease PRA level , divergent effect plasma concentration renin ( PRC ) : β-blockers decrease aliskiren increase . The reactive rise PRC potential implication regard antihypertensive efficacy aliskiren — high PRC level theoretically overcome competitive inhibition renin aliskiren , thereby increase PRA , Ang II , BP . Aliskiren study monotherapy combination antihypertensive drug , include hydrochlorothiazide , valsartan , amlodipine . It study presence β-blocker . Proposals future study include pursue whether hypertensive resistant aliskiren , mechanism ( ) resistance way overcome resistance . This prospective , open-label study effect sequential addition β-blocker ( extended release metoprolol ) aliskiren level plasma renin activity plasma renin concentration subject uncomplicated hypertension .</detailed_description>
