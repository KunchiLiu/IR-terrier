	<brief_summary>Summary : Vaginal prolapse well-known disease observe approximately 11 % postmenopausal woman tend increase age . Consequently , many surgical procedure develop order ensure sufficient support bladder , rectum vaginal vault depend site defect . However , many procedure associate high recurrence rate 40 % even within one two year surgical procedure . Due high recurrence rate new method include use mesh , either biologically synthetic . The latter permanent implant therefore theoretically may result long-lasting anatomically correct position prolapse . Although recurrence rate may lower use mesh surgical procedure may associate adverse event erosion vaginal mucosa . Others observe shrinkage vaginal mucosa . However , study large prolene mesh use . In contrast recurrence rate lower 25 % . The above-mentioned advantage synthetic mesh however , mostly base non-randomised study . We therefore find importance evaluate whether surgical procedure use mesh implant superior conventional surgical technique . The present study clinical control study patient anterior vaginal prolapse randomise either mesh technique standard anterior procedure . The present study include two visit outpatient clinic surgical procedure . Furthermore patient fulfil questionnaire regard urinary faecal leakage sexual habit . Any participation study totally voluntary patient may time withdraw . In case patient receive standard treatment . The study perform Scandinavian country .</brief_summary>
