	<brief_summary>Patients suffer stroke often present hospital elevate blood pressure . Elevated blood pressure set stroke increase risk brain swell bleed brain . Even , concern lower blood pressure medication newly injure part brain may get blood flow need , thereby worsen damage initial stroke . We hope demonstrate drug valsartan use safely modestly low blood pressure acute stroke patient , without detrimental effect brain blood flow neurologic status .

	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Lowering Acute Stroke Trial ( BLAST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension important modifiable risk factor prevention ischemic stroke . Whether specific antihypertensive medication confer added benefit recurrent stroke reduction beyond ability lower blood pressure remain controversial subject . Because varied mechanisms action , potential role neuroprotective agent , particular interest drug affect renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . Several large multi-national randomized clinical trial suggest unique benefit agent , namely angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor ARBs , prevention vascular event . Even modest reduction blood pressure achieve HOPE trial , ramipril find significant benefit recurrent stroke prevention ( Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators , 2000 ) . In LIFE study , losartan show efficacious prevention recurrent stroke hypertensive patient atenolol , despite nearly identical reduction blood pressure ( Dahl√∂f et al , 2002 ) . This area debate , however , data may support lower blood pressure general use specific agent ACE inhibitor prevention recurrent stroke ( PROGRESS Collaborative Group , 2001 ) . More recently , ACCESS study show benefit early treatment candesartan cilexetil 12-month mortality number vascular event patient suffer acute stroke ( Schrader et al , 2003 ) . The mechanisms underlie uncertain , study suggest early treatment blood pressure acute stroke may long-term benefit , presumably independent hemodynamic factor . The use antihypertensives set acute infarct area great interest . A transient rise blood pressure frequently see acute stroke patient ( Semplicini et al , 2003 ) . Although blood pressure typically normalizes within one week without treatment , one-third patient remain hypertensive ( Britton et al , 1986 ; Harper et al , 1994 ) . Currently , insufficient data clear recommendation deliberately alter blood pressure acute ischemic stroke patient ( BASC , 2004 ) . That say , hypertension acute stroke associate poor outcome ( Warlow et al , 1996 ) , although relationship may ' J'-shaped curve , low high mean blood pressure detrimental ( Leonardi-Bee et al , 2002 ) . The potential mechanism underlie association hypertension poor outcome acute stroke several , may include increase peri-infarct edema increase risk hemorrhagic transformation . The potential benefit early treatment high blood pressure acute stroke must weigh theoretical risk worsen ischemia compromise neural tissue . The INWEST trial show increased mortality patient actively treat calcium-channel blocker within 72 hour acute stroke ( Wahlgren et al , 1994 ) , effect may relate lower diastolic blood pressure ( Ahmed et al , 2000 ) . This data keep long-standing hypothesis impaired autoregulation ischemic brain tissue render cerebral blood flow purely pressure-dependent . A decrease systemic blood pressure would translate decreased local perfusion vulnerable tissue ischemic penumbra . It set drug modulate RAAS may unique role . In recent year , animal human data accrue suggest CBF maintain agent , even face decrease systemic blood pressure . There human data regard cerebral blood flow drug affect RAAS , normal patient recent ischemia . Studies ACE inhibitor demonstrate moderate lowering blood pressure hypertensive patient , without correspond decrease CBP , measure xenon CT ( Minematsu et al , 1987 ; Waldemar et al , 1990 ) . Dyker et al ( 1997 ) use Doppler ultrasound show cerebral blood flow maintain set acute stroke systemic blood pressure lower perindopril . A similar result see hypertensive stroke patient moderate severe internal carotid artery stenosis occlusion ( Walters et al , 2001 ) . When losartan introduce hypertensive patient within 2-7 day mild ischemic stroke , adverse effect global region cerebral blood flow , measure carotid Doppler brain hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission compute tomography ( HMPAO SPECT ; Nazir et al , 2004 ) . There publish data effect drug cerebral perfusion measure MRI , change infarct volume measure DWI . Brain image MRI available major center admit patient care ischemic stroke . Diffusion-weighted imaging consider 'gold standard ' detection ischemia acute setting , restrict diffusion visible within 30 minute symptom onset ( Fisher Albers , 1999 ) . Semi-quantitative measure cerebral blood flow obtain perfusion-weighted imaging ( PWI ) minimal increase total scanning time . The acquisition perfusion data MRI readily available modality PET , SPECT , xenon CT. Data ongoing identify analysis regimens PWI best represent true cerebral perfusion . We use technique assess brain perfusion lower blood pressure valsartan . We hope show valsartan use safely set acute stroke lower elevate blood pressure . There novel property class drug ( angiotensive-receptor blocker ARB ) , promise human animal data , would suggest drug safely use low blood pressure set acute stroke without compromise brain blood flow ( i.e . cerebral perfusion ) . If proved case , compound could potentially use routinely set , hope improve outcome . This pilot study may pave way large randomize trial look outcome measure stroke patient . Further , positive result pilot study serve proof concept ARBs maintain cerebral perfusion decrease blood pressure , overall favorable property .</detailed_description>
