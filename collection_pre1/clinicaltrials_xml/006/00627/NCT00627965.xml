	<brief_title>Randomized , Controlled Trial Regular Sildenafil Citrate Prevention Altitude Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High altitude pulmonary oedema ( HAPE ) life-threatening non-cardiogenic lung injury precipitate exaggerated pulmonary hypertension . The incidence rapidly progressive illness , among estimate 40 million visitor high altitude year , may high 0.5-2.0 % . The pathogenesis HAPE multifactorial may include impaired clearance alveolar fluid , increase pulmonary vascular permeability genetic susceptibility . Elevated pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) cause hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ( HPV ) key prerequisite development HAPE thus reduction PAP paramount prophylaxis treatment devastate illness . Nitric oxide ( NO ) think play important role exaggerate HPV characterises HAPE . NO , constitutively produce lung enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , increase intracellular cGMP pulmonary vascular smooth muscle activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase , ultimately lead reduction intracellular calcium smooth muscle relaxation . HAPE-susceptible individual exhale less NO normobaric hypobaric hypoxia suggest deficiency NO synthesis may predispose HAPE . At high altitude , inhale NO cause significantly great reduction systolic PAP HAPE-susceptible individual compare effect PAP HAPE-resistant subject , administration NO would impractical field . Most recently , work concentrate another target NO pathway . Sildenafil citrate orally active , potent selective phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor . PDE-5 predominant enzyme responsible degradation cGMP lung . In small sea level study , Zhao et al . demonstrate pre-treatment sildenafil nearly completely abolished pulmonary vasopressor response breathe hypoxic gas healthy human . More recently , study altitude also show reduction pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PASP ) subject take sildenafil high altitude . One potential problem use sildenafil altitude PDE-5 inhibitor may worsen symptom acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) . Headache define symptom AMS prominent side effect sildenafil . We conduct double-blind placebo-controlled randomise trial ass effect regular sildenafil administration PASP Lake Louise AMS score altitude 5200 .</detailed_description>
