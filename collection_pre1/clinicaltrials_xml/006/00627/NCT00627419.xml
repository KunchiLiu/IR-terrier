Prior therapy chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy melanoma allow provided therapy end prior study entry treatmentrelated toxicity resolve NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 patient 's baseline ; Measurable disease ( base RECIST [ Therasse , 2000 ] ) define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan ; Have melanoma biopsied prior treatment ( patient ) , second time treatment IPI504 ( stage 2 patient ) ; Willingness tumor biopsy screening ( patient ) treatment ( stage 2 patient ) ; Males females least 18 year age time study entry ; Female patient must non childbearing potential ( define &gt; 1 year postmenopausal ) use effective contraception , eg , use oral contraceptive additional barrier method ( since study drug may impair effectiveness oral contraceptive ) , double barrier method ( diaphragm spermicidal gel condom contraceptive foam ) , DepoProvera , partner vasectomy , total abstinence , time informed consent sign 30 day last dose IPI504 . Male patient must surgically sterile use doublebarrier method contraception ( condom spermicide ) time initiation IPI504 30 day last dose IPI504 ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 2 ; Life expectancy least 16 week ; White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3,000/mm3 , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 , platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ; Prothrombin time international normalized ratio within normal range ( unless patient receive anticoagulation therapy ) , PTT within normal range ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( CockroftGault method ) ; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN [ unless due Gilbert 's syndrome ( unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia ) case total bilirubin ≤ 3.5 mg/dL ] , AST ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN , hepatic alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5× ULN ; LDH ≤ 1.5 × ULN ; Patients prior radiation therapy eligible provide therapy palliative nature , area tumor biopsied , least one measurable lesion outside radiation field , radiationrelated toxicity resolve NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 patient 's baseline ; Patients recover prior major surgery eligible surgical wound heal ; Written inform consent HIPAA authorization obtain patient prior receipt study medication begin study procedure . Received investigational agent therapy kinase inhibitor within 2 week prior study entry antitumor therapy , cytostatic and/or cytotoxic drug , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biological response modifier within 4 week prior study entry ; Previous treatment 17AAG , 17dimethylaminoethylamino17demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17DMAG ) , know Hsp90 inhibitor ; Any concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic hormonal therapy treatment cancer ; Current plan participation ( day study entry 30 day last dose IPI504 ) research protocol investigational agent therapy may administer ; Initiation discontinuation concurrent medication alters CYP3A activity ( see Appendix C ) within 2 week prior treatment IPI504 . Patients stable dose drug know alter CYP3A activity &gt; 2 week eligible enroll ; Presence active infection systemic use antimicrobial within 72 hour prior treatment IPI504 ; Known brain metastasis primary brain tumor .
