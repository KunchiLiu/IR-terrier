	<brief_title>Improving Executive Functioning After Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) : A Trial `` Short Term Executive Plus '' Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Executive dysfunction follow brain injury ( BI ) commonly observe well documented literature ( Mateer , 1999 ; Prigatano , 1999 ; Levine et al. , 2000 ; Shallice &amp; Burgess , 1991 ; Cicerone &amp; Giacino , 1992 ; Goldman-Rakic , 1993 ; Lezak , 1995 , Riegal &amp; Gauggel , 2002 ; McDonald , 2002 ; Stuss Levine , 2003 ) .

Studies describe rehabilitation executive dysfunction limit mostly single case small group design ( Cicerone , et al. , 2000 ) . However , three small randomize clinical trial promise result suggest need research area . When consider study , evident emphasis place three area intervention : attention remediation , emotional regulation problem-solving . Consequently , give pervasive disability find individual BI secondary executive function disorder promise , limited , success problem-solving-based intervention executive function , randomize control trial ( RCT ) efficacy short-term , intensive executive function train program ( Short-Term Executive Plus ) propose . The Short-Term Executive Plus ( STEP ) program combine treatment treatment approach prove effective previous study compare `` wait-list '' control group . This design choose appropriate control intervention exists . In word `` standard '' rehabilitation treatment available individual could serve appropriate `` control '' condition/treatment . As discuss earlier , cognitive remediation typically deliver extended full-time day treatment program weekly/bi-weekly individual session . Using traditional extended treatment control condition would inappropriate , person participate extend , full-time target propose intervention . It hypothesized STEP program result significant improvement executive functioning ( related area attention , memory , community participation , life satisfaction ) .</detailed_description>
