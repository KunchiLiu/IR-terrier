	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and/or Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine effect omega-3 fatty acid marker breast cancer progression woman newly diagnose ductal carcinoma situ and/or atypical ductal hyperplasia . - To determine effect omega-3 fatty acid specific target identify microarray breast cancer cell primary culture benign malignant breast tissue biopsy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral omega-3 fatty acid capsule 3 time daily 8 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo olive oil capsule 3 time daily 8 week . Patients complete questionnaire baseline , weekly study treatment , completion study treatment , 30 day completion study treatment . These questionnaire include Fish Oil Adverse Event Questionnaire , Diet Family History Questionnaire , Changes Diet Medications Questionnaire , Post-Intervention Questionnaire . Patients undergo blood , urine , nipple aspirate , tissue sample collection baseline completion study treatment translational research study . Blood sample analyze genetic marker breast cancer risk progression microarray analysis red blood cell ( RBC ) fatty acid . Nipple aspirate sample analyze fatty acid determine extent omega-3 fatty acid supplementation alters fatty acid profile breast tissue . Tissue sample analyze presence ductal carcinoma situ and/or atypical ductal hyperplasia invasive cancer . Leftover blood , urine , nipple aspirate , tissue sample store future research study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
