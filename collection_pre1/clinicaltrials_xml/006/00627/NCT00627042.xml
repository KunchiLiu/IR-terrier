	<brief_title>Study IMC-1121B ( Ramucirumab ) Participants With Liver Cancer Who Have Not Previously Been Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibition angiogenesis consider promising approach treatment cancer . Members vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) important mediator angiogenesis likely important therapeutic target advance hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) . Angiogenesis appear integral HCC development pathogenesis . Angiogenesis inhibition efficacious vitro vivo HCC model result clinical study also suggest potential inhibit disease growth . Ramucirumab fully human monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) specifically bind extracellular domain VEGFR-2 high affinity . Phase 1 study currently near completion demonstrate safety tolerability clinically relevant dos , preliminary evidence clinical efficacy variety human cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant must histologicallyconfirmed , unresectable HCC The participant least one unidimensionallymeasurable target lesion [ ≥ 2 centimeter ( cm ) conventional technique , ≥ 1 cm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ] , define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Target lesion ( ) must lay within previously irradiate , ablate , chemoembolized area . If target lesion lie area , must evidence growth successive imaging study , include tumor hypervascularity , order lesion consider target lesion The participant Cancer Liver Italian Programme ( CLIP ) score 03 The participant ChildPugh Classification score A B ( liver dysfunction ) The participant provide sign informed consent The participant receive prior systemic chemotherapy , biologic antiangiogenic therapy , investigational systemic therapy HCC The participant bleed esophageal gastric varix 3 month prior study participation . Note : If participant history know esophageal varix , evidence esophageal varix CT/MRI , participant must undergo endoscopic evaluation prior study entry ( minimally invasive capsule esophageal endoscopy acceptable initial modality ) . The participant endoscopically detect esophageal varix eligible provide he/she meet entry criterion . The participant history current evidence esophageal varix must receive oral betablocker therapy throughout participation study , he/she may receive optimal endoscopic therapy determine consult gastroenterologist hepatologist , must undergo regular endoscopic followup throughout participation study The participant acute hepatitis The participant central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases carcinomatous meningitis The participant poorlycontrolled hypertension [ word ( ie ) , blood pressure abnormal range despite medical management ]</criteria>
