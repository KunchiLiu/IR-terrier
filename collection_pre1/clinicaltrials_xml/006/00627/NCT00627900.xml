	<brief_summary>Since advent coronary stent , in-stent restenosis proven major limitation interventional cardiology , occur many 30 % patient . Drug-eluting stent specifically design prevent problem in-stent restenosis . They consist selective anti-proliferative drug , sirolimus , controlled-release polymer , closed-cell stent delivery platform . Upon placement , sirolimus elutes vessel wall stop process neointimal hyperplasia , thereby significantly reduce incidence in-stent restenosis . The study `` Prevention Coronary Restenosis '' examine effectiveness sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) compare bare-metal stent ( BMS ) patient coronary stenosis . The goal study examine whether guideline-supported implantation SES , despite high initial cost , improve quality economic outcome treatment patient coronary stenosis . Secondarily , study evaluate patient quality life , impairment daily activity , re-intervention rate , well account utilisation benefit implement standardised guideline . In prospective , multi-centre , country-wide cohort study , 658 patient undergoing implantation SES treatment coronary stenosis recruit 35 hospital centre . Their treatment outcomes evaluate 3-year period mean standardise questionnaire . In addition , information obtain patient confirm augmented telephone interview attend physician involve follow-up care . In order appraise effect new therapy , comparison cohort group 394 patient receive BMS recruit . These patient evaluate observed method patient receive drug-eluting stent , also 3 year</brief_summary>
