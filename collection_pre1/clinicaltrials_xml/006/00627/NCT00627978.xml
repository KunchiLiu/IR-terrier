	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives - Assess ultrastructure change dermal myelinated nerve patient receive ixabepilone chemotherapy - Detailed characterization peripheral neuropathy patient receive ixabepilone Secondary Objectives - Clinical benefit rate - Time progression ( TTP ) - Toxicity - Exploratory study : - Relation MDR 1 TRKA polymorphisms evolution ultrastructural neurologic change observe neuron . - Relation NGF , IL8 , IL10 development clinical symptom ultrastructural change neuron .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Ixabepilone Metastatic Breast Cancer Its Effects Ultrastructure Neurons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient population : - Stage 4 breast cancer - Resolution toxicity prior therapy ≤ CTC grade 1 ( except alopecia ) - No limit prior number therapy treat cancer - Adequate organ function - Life expectancy great 3 month Treatment : ixabepilone 40 mg/m2 Q3w 3 hour Evaluation Study : I. Efficacy evaluation : - Baseline CT chest , abdomen pelvis bone scan within 4 week start therapy - Evaluation disease every 2 cycle chemotherapy - Ongoing toxicity evaluation use NCI CTC 3 . II . Neurological evaluation : - Detailed neurologic exam use Neuropathy Assessment Instrument ( represent standard neurological exam ) - Serum NGF , IL 8,10 , prior start therapy prior cycle ixabepilone - DNA assessment TRK A MDR1 polymorphism - Punch biopsy skin prior start therapy every 2 cycle . Laboratory evaluation peripheral nerve biopsy conduct Rockefeller University direction Dr. Carlson Dr. Strickland 's Lab .</detailed_description>

Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score 70 100 ; ( Appendix 1 ) . Life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate recovery drug relate toxicity prior systemic therapy ( recovery &lt; = Grade 1 except Grade 2 fatigue alopecia ) . Adequate recovery recent surgery radiation therapy . At least one week must elapse time minor surgery and/or focal/palliative radiation therapy ; least 3 week major surgery radiation therapy . Women Men , age &gt; = 18 year . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hematologic function absolute neutrophil ≥ 1,500/mm3 and/or platelet &gt; 125,000/mm3 Hepatic function serum bilirubin le 1.5 time upper institutional limit normal , ALT ≤ 2.5 time upper institutional limit normal ( ≤ 5 time upper institutional limit normal document hepatic metastasis present ) Renal function serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men partner childbearing potential must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 4 week study manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea &gt; = 12 consecutive month ; woman hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL ) . Even woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) , consider child bear potential .

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Exclusion Criteria Patients know active brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . CTC Grade 2 great neuropathy ( motor sensory ) study entry . Prior treatment ixabepilone . Serious intercurrent infection , nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize complication therapy , include , limited : ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known history HIV infection . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive concurrent chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy regimen radiation therapy , standard investigational .
