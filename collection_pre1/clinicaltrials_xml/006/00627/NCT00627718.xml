	<brief_summary>Age Related Macular Degeneration ( ARMD ) common cause irreversible blindness people age 50 old western population . ARMD two form , wet dry form . The wet form serious lead irreversible loss vision . In wet form ARMD , new blood vessel grow retina . These blood vessel leak blood fluid cause retina macula swell . So thickness macula increase . One key factor treatment wet ARMD early diagnosis treatment prevent complete visual loss . In research , go use technique , call Heidelberg retinal tomograph ( HRT ) measure compare thickness macula healthy control patient suspect ARMD . HRT non-invasive imaging system use laser measure thickness macula . This allow u come quite simple easy-to-use technique help u diagnose wet ARMD early treat visual acuity completely lose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Age-related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) spectrum relate disease affect macula traditionally classify early late stage dry ( non-exudative ) wet ( exudative ) form . Although advanced form AMD less common , potential visual loss significant . The Beaver Dam Eye Study report 30 % individual age 75 old form AMD , whereas 7 % age 75 old advanced form . Recent study estimate 8 million Americans consider risk develop advanced ARMD next 5 year , whereas 1.75 million currently affect advanced form disease . Wet AMD characterize proliferation abnormal vessel choroid . These choroidal neovascular membrane may proliferate subretinal space retina leak fluid blood . This fluid may accumulate macula area cause macular edema ( ME ) , final common pathway visual loss many disease . There currently treatment reverse repair destruction restore visual acuity . The critical time intervention early disease , visual acuity minimally affect . Due irreversible nature disease realistic risk permanent vision loss , increase need improve accuracy identify presence extent MEvwith prompt referral retina specialist follow diagnosis . ME traditionally assess clinically use combination slit lamp biomicroscopy fluorescein angiography . New image technique optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , retinal thickness analyser ( RTA ) , Heidelberg retinal tomograph ( HRT ) confocal scan laser ophthalmoscope facilitate qualitative assessment degree ME . Although OCT high sensitivity specificity detection ME within 500 micron fovea , resolution decrease outside area . RTA show low sensitivity ( 57 % ) detection ME . 4 The Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph II ( HRT II , Heidelberg Engineering ) non-invasive , confocal scan laser image system use red ( 670 nm ) diode laser perform series optical section macula area cover 15°x15° field view , correspond approximately 4.5 x 4.5 mm retina . The reflected laser light intensity process assist quantitative diagnosis ME . If ME present , amount scatter inside swollen retina increase , reduce retinal reflectance . A study evaluate HRT detect ME . Tong co-worker propose score system macular image assessment use HRT patient diabetic maculopathy . Guan co-worker find HRT sensitivity specificity 92 % 68 % detect ME diabetic population use clinical assessment gold standard . To best knowledge , study yet validate use HRT detection ME early sign exudative disease ARMD patient . Purpose : The purpose study assess sensitivity , specificity , repeatability , HRT presence ME exudative ARMD Design : Prospective , observational study . Objectives : 1 ) Assessment healthy volunteer obtain baseline normal measurement macular thickening . 2 ) Measurements ARMD patient 's referred retinal specialist clinic diagnosis exudative form ARMD Patients , Material , Methods : 1 ) normal control ( N=20 ) : baseline measurement center fovea take . Three consecutive measurement perform ( within-session repeatability ) . 2 ) Patients : New patient refer general ophthalmologist retina specialist possible diagnosis ARMD , exudative form , include study . All patient undergo full ophthalmologic exam retinal specialist determine clinical presence ME ( gold standard ) use fundus contact lens examination . In case , fluorescein angiogram use ancillary test . All patient evaluate use HRT presence ME use macula edema module . The technician performing test mask patient ' clinical diagnosis . Three consecutive measurement perform 4 quadrant ( 500-1000-1500 microns/ 4 quadrant ) ( color map reflectivity ) 3 ) Comparison make clinical diagnosis ME ( gold standard ) result obtain HRT . Features compare : 1 ) presence/absence ME 2 ) spacial agreement area elevate retina encounter HRT Vs clinical examination .</detailed_description>
