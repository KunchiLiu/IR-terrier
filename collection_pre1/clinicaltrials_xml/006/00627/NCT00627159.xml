	<brief_summary>Research show presence heart disease stroke high Indo-Asian population compare ethno-cultural group . This may due multiple reason high presence diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , obesity , low level physical activity . This program bring together Calgary Indo-Central-Asian community Calgary Healthcare community help reduce rate heart disease stroke supportive , culturally-sensitive program community-based following step : 1 . Increase awareness heart disease stroke education among Calgary Indo-Central-Asian population . 2 . Identify early , risk factor related heart disease stroke screen program . 3 . Provide appropriate follow-up care population risk heart disease stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ICA-CHAMP : Indo-Central Asian Cardiovascular Health Assessment Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Various study confirm individual SE Asian descent high prevalence cardiovascular disease compare ethnicity due high prevalence metabolic syndrome , diabetes , insulin resistance , central obesity , dyslipidemias ( low high-density lipoprotein , increase lipoprotein [ ] , high triglyceride level ) , increase thrombotic tendency ( increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decrease tissue plasminogen activator level ) , decreased level physical activity Hypertension , particular become one leading cause mortality among Asians . Projected figure suggest Indo-Asians hypertension prevalence increase 16.3 % 19.5 % 1995 2025 . Despite increased prevalence hypertension among Indo-Asians , majority case remain undetected poorly manage . Disparities health system utilization associate high prevalence hypertension lead increased number patient present target organ damage stroke , heart failure renal insufficiency . Epidemiological study demonstrate high-risk ethnic group access barrier mainstream program may benefit targeted culture specific intervention . Given Indo-Asians represent increase proportion Canadian population high risk cardiovascular disease experience health care access barrier , initiation tailor risk factor screen intervention program timely . The collaborative effort target community healthcare system provide unique opportunity develop evaluate sustainable screening , early detection intervention program hypertension CVD risk factor , tailor meet unique cultural need target population . Only encompass program scope reduce risk cardiovascular disease highly susceptible population . The project objectives follow : - To increase Indo-Central Asian community awareness cardiovascular risk factor - To develop implement community base , culturally sensitive self-sustaining cardiovascular risk factor screen management program . - To increase early detection modifiable , undiagnosed , uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factor - Using partnership-based , culturally appropriate integrate approach , provide sustainable cost effective intervention program optimal management risk factor Indo-Central Asian population utilize exist health region community resource . - To develop continuum care address need Indo-Central Asian Calgarians tailor intensity intervention perceive risk - To validate `` Continuum Care '' process The project components follow : * Screening session : The project utilize previously develop Indo-Asian Diabetes Initiative methodology recruit train volunteer target community . Using standardized interview question , follow information collect : age , gender , family history ( first degree relative premature cardiovascular disease ) , cardiovascular risk factor . Trained volunteer would administer question one one interview English common language use participant community . Blood pressure obtain use validated Bp assessment tool ( BpTRU ) . All screen either high blood pressure ( ≥140/90 ≥130/80 diabetes ) least one risk factor ( positive family personal history cardiovascular disease , diabetes , smoker , know elevate cholesterol medication HBP , lipids diabetes ) go capillary measurement random TC/HDL perform Cholestech desktop reflometer ( Hayward CA ) . Based health history assessment obtain , total CVD risk ( coronary heart disease stroke ) predict use Joint British Societies Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Chart . Those participant find high risk ( &gt; 20 % 10 year CVD risk ) refer , via family physician , HRIC clinic . Those moderate low risk ( ≤20 % 10 year CVD risk ) refer CDM program . All participant screen receive adapt culturally sensitive version 2007 Canadian Public Recommendations education booklet ( adapt Blood Pressure Canada ) include hypertension , dietary , alcohol smoke cessation information . - Intervention : All qualify participant assess volunteer pharmacist , nurse , physician , health care professional review participant ' current medication provide education around adherence adverse event . The complete assessment predict risk score review participant . The predicted risk score facilitate participant 's enrolment appropriate follow program . Participants re-directed back family physician BP monitoring medication initiation adjustment require . Participants provide `` Health Report '' include current medication , blood pressure , TC HDL result , predict CVD risk score follow-up instruction . Interventions follow : - High CVD Risk Intervention : Individuals high risk refer High Risk Intervention Clinic full cardiovascular evaluation . This include history physician exam Internal Medicine Specialist alternate specialist similar cardiovascular training experience An ECG perform likely either stress test nuclear cardiology study . Risk factor aggressively manage . - Low Moderate CVD Risk Intervention : Individuals low moderate risk refer convenient culturally appropriate CDM community program ( culturally sensitive education physical activity program ) . - Follow-up Sessions : Consenting participant contact project volunteer invite back reassessment one year initial evaluation . Reassessment entail work-up similar conduct initial screening session .</detailed_description>
