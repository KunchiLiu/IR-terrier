	<brief_summary>1 . Patients include benign malignant lesion treatment plan endoscopic resection resection minimally invasive technique . 2 . They offer robotic approach surgery use DaVinci robotic surgical system ( intuitive Surgical , Inc. ) . 3 . The objective evaluate ability adequately visualize surgical field perform intend surgery without high complication rate . 4 . Secondary objective include evaluation blood loss , length hospital stay , complication use DaVinci robot system , quality life subject historical control undergo similar surgery without robot radiation therapy . 5 . To evaluate recurrence , survival outcome data robotic surgery patient compare similar historical control group ( match respect stage , prior subsequent treatment , age , tumor HPV positivity ) patient undergone standard surgery without robot radiation/chemoradiation treatment alternative surgery . 5 . Endpoints compare historical control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Use DaVinci Robotic System Otorhinolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) evaluate pilot study consist 3 basic component : surgeon 's console , articulate mechanical arm sterilizable instrument . The console include computer , video monitor instrument control , locate operating room adjacent operating room table . The console connect via computer mechanical arm hold endoscope ( surgical TV camera ) sterile surgical tool ( e.g. , forceps , scissors , electrocautery , etc. ) . These arm locate immediately adjacent patient operate room table . The surgeon sit console control position movement arm surgical tool . The design tool base upon well-established , commonly use surgical instrument . The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) `` manual image-guided surgery '' system computer enhance rather `` computer guide robotic surgery '' surgeon program computer surgery robot surgery ( also know `` milling '' device ) .22 Use da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System ( Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) aforementioned configuration fact facilitate exact translation surgeon 's hand finger movement console precise tremor-free movement arm instrument .</detailed_description>
