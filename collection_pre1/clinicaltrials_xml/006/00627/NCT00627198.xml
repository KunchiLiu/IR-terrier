	<brief_summary>This open-label , phase II study evaluate safety efficacy PTK787/ZK222584 administer daily subject neuroendocrine tumor experience progressive disease and/or whose tumor-related syndrome symptom ( flush diarrhea ) consider inadequately control despite optimal dos octreotide therapy . Inadequate control define minimum 2 flush episode 6 bowel movement per day 7 consecutive day . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion complete baseline screen test receive initial dose PTK787/ZK222584 1,250 mg daily subject also remain scheduled dos Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 4 week . Both drug dose flat schedule mg , weight body surface area . The PTK787/ZK222584 medication take orally daily dose . Each tablet PTK787/ZK 222584 250 mg . The subject take five tablet study medication per day 2 tab 3 tab pm . Subjects may continue receive therapy long experience unacceptable toxicity evidence disease progression define RECIST criterion . Subjects evaluate daily log ass degree symptom control ( flush diarrhea ) subject monitor every 2 week 3 month monthly biochemical control every three month tumor response . Subjects monitor Investigator every two week 3 month monthly safety efficacy .</brief_summary>
