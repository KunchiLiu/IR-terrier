	<detailed_description>Coronary MDCTA ( multi-detector CT angiography ) novel already establish widespread diagnostic method diagnose coronary artery disease . When perform 64-detector ( slice ) CT , strength excellent negative predictive value , NPV ( 98 % ) . Specificity ( 86 % ) good positive predictive value ( PPV ) moderate ( 70 % ) . This due ability MDCTA detect even minor vessel wall change functionally significant , tendency CT overestimate volume dense calcification . However , couple functional flow-sensitive diagnostic test , PET perfusion coronary doppler ultrasonography , one assume even PPV may high 95 % . Despite assumption , ` scientific evidence support use hybrid multi-modality test present . Our hypothesis improve diagnostic accuracy non-invasive diagnosis coronary artery disease decrease proportion patient need catheter angiography . The avoidance unnecessary invasive procedure improve patients´ quality life may even redirect health care resource efficient way .</detailed_description>
