	<criteria>1 . Age 21 64 year : Patients age 21 automatically triaged Children 's Hospital Montefiore Emergency Department , hence enrol study . Age 64 select upper range inclusion substantial evidence support age important determinant morphine requirement long period time . 2 . Pain onset within 7 day : Pain within seven day definition acute pain use ED literature . 3 . ED attend physician 's judgment patient 's pain warrant use intravenous opioids : The factor influence decision use intravenous opioids complex extensive . An approach commonly take address issue patient selection drug trial use specific condition ( e.g. , renal colic ) treatment ( e.g. , posthysterectomy ) would generally think appropriately treat opioid analgesic , thereby eliminate individual judgment eligibility study . However order assess role IV opioids wide generalizability ED setting , decide enroll patient variety diagnosis , complaint acute pain . Opioids appropriate treatment patient present complaint pain ( e.g. , gastroenteritis , migraine ) . Therefore either comprehensive list diagnosis situation opioids indicate must specify , clinical judgment need use . We opt latter alternative . 4 . Normal mental status : In order provide measure pain experienced patient need normal mental status . Orientation person , place time use indicator sufficiently normal mental status participate study . 1 . Prior use methadone : effect methadone use perception acute pain unknown suspect alter . 2 . Use opioids , tramadol , heroin past seven day : avoid introduce bias relate opioid tolerance may alter response intravenous opioids thereby mask effect medication administer . 3 . Prior adverse reaction morphine , hydromorphone , opioids : An exception patient receive opioid medication past without adverse event ( i.e . patient may state allergic morphine receive hydromorphone past without adverse effect ) 4 . Chronic pain syndrome : frequently recurrent daily pain least 3 month result alteration pain perception think due downregulation pain receptor . Examples chronic pain syndrome include sickle cell anemia , osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia , migraine , peripheral neuropathy . 5 . Alcohol intoxication : presence alcohol intoxication may alter perception , report , treatment pain . Alcohol intoxication determine exist judged treating physician . 6 . Systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg : Opioids produce peripheral vasodilation may result orthostatic hypotension syncope . 7 . Use MAO inhibitor past 30 day : MAOs report intensify effect least one opioid drug cause anxiety , confusion significant depression respiration coma . 8 . Weight le 100 pound : concern hydromorphone dose 2 mg may safe patient weigh less 100 lb . 9 . Baseline room air oxygen saturation le 95 % : since IV opioids may cause respiratory depression result hypoxemia , exclude subgroup patient . 10 . C02 measurement great 46 : In accordance similar study ( 0412360 ) , four subset patient CO2 measure use handheld capnometer prior enrollment study . If CO2 measurement great 46 , patient exclude study . The 4 subset follow : 1 . All patient history COPD 2 . All patient history sleep apnea 3 . All patient report history asthma together great 20 packyear smoke history 4 . All patient report less 20 packyear smoke history asthma exacerbation</criteria>
