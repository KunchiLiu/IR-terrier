	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy safety 48 week LPV/r monotherapy 2 NRTIs + LPV/r therapy patient fail standard NNRTI-based treatment regimen . Also , evaluate short-term 24-week efficacy safety Lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) monotherapy 2 NRTIs+LPV/r therapy patient fail standard NNRTI-based treatment regimen interim analyse 50 % patient arm reach 24 week randomization . Last , define risk factor monotherapy failure HIV-treated individual Hypothesis . The rate virologic suppression inferior monotherapy arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With least 80,000 HIV-1 infected individual throughout Thailand currently generically produce fix dose combination d4T/3TC/NVP GPOvir first line national recommendation therapy , inevitably face resistance problem large number patient near future . Therefore comprehensive investigation best second line regimen individual need . Given situation Thailand economic burden major challenge , second line regimen offer great possible efficacy , cost-effectiveness . Second-line therapy necessitate treatment combination drug include protease inhibitor [ 3 ] . Such high drug concentration achieve combine protease inhibitor ( indinavir , saquinavir , amprenavir lopinavir ) ritonavir ( RTV ) , know boost protease plasma level potent inhibition cytochrome P450 . Low dose RTV ( 100mg bid ) significantly improve pharmacokinetics ( AUC plasma half life ) protease inhibitor exception nelfinavir . However , combination expensive , particularly NRTIs continue . In addition increase cost , continue NRTIs may add antiviral effect ( resistance present ) may prolong toxicity observe previous regimen . Mono boost PI therapy trial HIV adult , maintenance therapy suppress viral load , show effective safe [ 4-6 ] . This strategy decrease number pill per dose also save ARV cost might improve patient 's adherence . Lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) widely use protease inhibitor high efficacy high genetic barrier . As maintenance monotherapy HIV-1 viral suppression , LPV/r show efficacy 4 adult trial 81-94 % virological suppression [ 4 , 7 ] . In OK study [ 4 ] , virological failure case significantly high missed dos ( p = 0.008 ) . Viral re-suppression reintroduction 2NRTIs achieve LPV/r monotherapy arm . A pilot study switch LPV/r monotherapy NNRTI-based therapy report 92 % participant treatment week 48 HIV RNA &lt; 75 copies/mL [ 8 ] . In OK04 study [ 9 ] , 196 patient randomize eitherLPV/r monotherapy LPV/r plus 2NRTIs . The percentage viral suppression &lt; 50 copies/ml , week 96 77 % LPV/r monotherapy arm 78 % LPV/r plus 2NRTIs arm . In MONARK study , LPV/r monotherapy use 138 naïve adult percentage viral suppression week 48 71 % compare 75 % LPV/r plus AZT 3TC arm [ 10 ] ( p = 0.69 ) . Two patient LPV/r monotherapy develop PI mutation able resuppress HIV-RNA NRTIs add . Neither patient displayed phenotypic resistance LPV/r . Therefore , propose comprehensive study guide u identify best second line regimen order prepare large scale antiretroviral resistance problem Thailand .</detailed_description>
