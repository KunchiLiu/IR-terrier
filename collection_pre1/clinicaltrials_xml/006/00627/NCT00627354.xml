	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , mitoxantrone , etoposide , vinorelbine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know drug effective kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well mitoxantrone work compare etoposide vinorelbine work second-line therapy treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitoxantrone , Etoposide , Vinorelbine As Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine palliative response rate patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer treat mitoxantrone hydrochloride v etoposide v vinorelbine ditartrate second-line therapy . Secondary - Determine duration palliative response patient treat regimen . - Determine biological response ( PSA &gt; 50 % ) patient . - Determine time progression ( biological clinical ) patient . - Determine overall survival patient . - Determine quality life impact autonomy patient 70 year age . - Determine toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 5 minute week 3 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral etoposide twice daily day 1-14 . - Arm III : Patients receive oral vinorelbine ditartrate daily day 1 8 oral prednisone daily day 1-21 . Treatment three arm repeat every 3 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
