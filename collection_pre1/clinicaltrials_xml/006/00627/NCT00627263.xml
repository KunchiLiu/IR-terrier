Initially , participant complete questionnaire mood attitude . Next , baseline study visit , participant complete mental stress exercise perform math problem describe experience make angry . During exercise , participant undergo blood pressure measurement , blood collection , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) measure electrical activity heart . Participants also wear monitor 24 hour study visit record heart activity . Participants randomly assign either take part SRT group receive usual care receive usual care . For 10 week , participant SRT group attend 8 group session focus learn apply stress reduction technique everyday living . All participant attend 3-month follow-up visit repeat baseline test . At Months 6 , 12 , 24 , participant complete questionnaire routine doctor 's visit mail .</detailed_description>
