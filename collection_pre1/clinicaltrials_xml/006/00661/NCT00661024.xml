	<brief_title>Visualization Versus Intraoperative Neuromonitoring Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apart hypoparathyroidism , dysfunction recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) common complication follow thyroid surgery . In consequence , voice impairment lead communication work-related problem affect psychological social aspect individual 's functioning diminishes overall quality life , common reason medicolegal claim litigation . The report RLN palsy rate varies literature 0 % ( first-time thyroid surgery perform experienced endocrine surgeon ) much 20 % ( reoperative thyroid surgery thyroid malignancy surgery perform low-volume center ) , depend mostly type thyroid disease ( benign vs. malignant goiter ) , type ( first-time vs. reoperation ) extent thyroid resection ( subtotal vs. total thyroidectomy ) , surgical technique ( without routine RLN identification ) surgeon 's experience ( low-volume vs. high-volume thyroid surgery center . In 1938 , Lahey Boston report significantly low incidence RLN injuries follow thyroidectomy dissection visualization nerve compare operation without nerve identification . Since time , many prospective study confirm observation , advocate routine RLN identification gold standard safe thyroid surgery . But even experience hand RLN palsy occur occasionally , average frequency 1 % nerve risk due variability RLNs anatomy difficulty nerve identification visual palpation control challenge condition ( e.g . advanced thyroid malignancy reoperative thyroid surgery ) . On hand , use intraoperative electrical stimulation identify RLN nerve describe 1966 . However , technique intraoperative neuromonitoring ( IONM ) RLN gain widespread popularity late ninety last century , several commercial user-friendly system base electromyographic signal recording become available . In IONM system , RLN nerve stimulation register elicited laryngeal muscle activity endoscopic insertion electrode vocal cord , open insertion needle electrodes vocal muscle cricothyroid ligament use endotracheal tube surface electrode . In addition plethora signal acquisition technique use IONM , consensus regard optimal method nerve activity recording ( continuous record spontaneous nerve activity versus repetitive stimulation ) agreement quantitative electromyographic parameter use predictor postoperative vocal cord dysfunction ( supramaximal versus minimal stimulation nerve end operation ) . Some recent study show IONM aid RLN identification . However , role IONM reduce incidence RLN injury rate value method predict postoperative RLN function remain controversial . Only published series represent level III evidence grade C recommendation accord evidence-based criterion ( Sackett 's classification , modify Heinrich ) . Large , prospective , randomized trial address issue allow grade A recommendation lack due ethical concern large number patient arm ( 7000 patient ) need reach appropriate power study . To fulfill gap evidence , design medium-size , single-center , prospective randomize study suitable draw meaningful conclusion . Thus , aim study compare impact RLN visualization versus IONM morbidity follow thyroid surgery .</detailed_description>
