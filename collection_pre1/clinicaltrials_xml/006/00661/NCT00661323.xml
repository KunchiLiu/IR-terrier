	<brief_title>Evaluating New Echocardiography Imaging Procedure Evaluating Heart Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRI non-invasive method obtain image body . An MRI conduct person lie narrow table , slide large tunnel-like tube . Powerful magnet radio wave scan body computer record result signal . An echocardiography non-invasive ultrasound test use sound wave create image heart . It perform doctor move wand-like device patient 's chest . The device convert sound wave picture heart . Currently , special MRI technique use evaluate heart function ; however , MRI expensive use critically ill patient . Echocardiography perform patient 's bedside may effective way assess heart function . The purpose study determine effectiveness new four-dimensional echocardiography approach evaluate heart function . Results study may use diagnose treat patient effectively future . This study enroll healthy people heart disease people receive chemotherapy heart disease . Participants physical examination medical record review . MRI scan four-dimensional echocardiography heart perform . There additional study visit .</detailed_description>
