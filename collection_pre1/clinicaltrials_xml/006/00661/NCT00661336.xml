	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Buthionine sulfoximine may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sometimes chemotherapy give , stop growth tumor cell . The tumor say resistant chemotherapy . Giving buthionine sulfoximine together chemotherapy may reduce drug resistance allow tumor cell kill . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose melphalan give isolated limb infusion together buthionine sulfoximine treat patient persistent recurrent stage III malignant melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Normothermic Isolated Limb Infusion ( ILI ) With Melphalan Plus Buthionine Sulfoximine ( BSO ) Patients With Locally Advanced Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose melphalan administer isolated limb infusion combination systemic infusion buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) patient persistent recurrent stage IIIB IIIC in-transit malignant melanoma . Secondary - To define dose-limiting toxicity regional melphalan administer systemic BSO patient . - To determine whether combination systemic BSO regional melphalan yield clinical response patient respond well prior melphalan-based regional treatment . - To determine effectiveness systemic BSO decrease tumor glutathione ( GSH ) level effect GST activity GST expression . - To examine correlation tumor GSH level GSH level peripheral blood mononuclear cell determine latter serve surrogate marker tumor GSH depletion . - To determine pharmacokinetics systemic BSO regional melphalan patient . - To determine BSO alters mRNA expression signature melphalan resistance . - To determine , preliminarily , efficacy systemic BSO regional melphalan patient . - To correlate baseline mRNA expression signature melphalan resistance treatment efficacy . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study melphalan . Patients receive buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) IV continuously day 1-3 melphalan isolate limb infusion ( ILI ) 30 minute day 2 absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo biopsy blood sample collection baseline , immediately ILI , 12 week ILI time disease progression . Samples analyze GST genotype , tumor glutathione ( GSH ) level ( enzymatic assay HPLC/fluorescence detection [ FLD ] ) , drug pharmacokinetics , mRNA expression signature melphalan resistance . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 , 6 , 12 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
