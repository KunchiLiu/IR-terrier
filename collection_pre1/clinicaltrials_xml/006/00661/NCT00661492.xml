	<brief_summary>To determine time progression produce combination Novantrone ( mitoxantrone ) Erbitux ( cetuximab ) versus Novantrone alone metastatic AIPC patient previously treat docetaxel-based chemotherapy . TTP define time start treatment date date patient first record disease progression , even patient discontinue study treatment early due toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitoxantrone Â± Cetuximab 2nd Line Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer ( AIPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This nonblinded , randomize phase II study determine activity Novantrone ( mitoxantrone ) without Erbitux ( cetuximab ) patient androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) treat previously docetaxel chemotherapy . The Novantrone ( mitoxantrone ) -only treatment arm serve concurrent control arm aid determination benefit Novantrone ( mitoxantrone ) -Erbitux ( cetuximab ) combination set . Patients randomly assign 2:1 1 2 treatment arm ; 93 patient Arm 1 47 patient Arm 2 . A balanced randomization procedure perform utilizing code list develop prior study opening . Because patient stratify performance status ( ECOG 0 1 vs. ECOG 2 ) , list develop ensure balance 2 treatment arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Note : Patients may either measurable nonmeasurable disease . Radiographic evidence regional distant metastasis Current evidence progression ( PSA and/or image study ) despite standard hormonal therapy . Progression PSA define : A rise PSA define : least 2 rise PSA reference value ( PSA # 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( PSA # 2 ) must take least 1 week PSA # 1 . A third PSA ( PSA # 3 ) require great PSA # 2 ; , fourth PSA ( PSA # 4 ) require great PSA # 2 . Progression nonmeasurable disease define 2 new bone lesion ; measurable disease , progression define standard RECIST criterion . For patient antiandrogen therapy ( ie , bicalutamide , flutamide , etc . ) , patient must discontinue antiandrogen therapy least 6 week ( 4 week flutamide ) without evidence antiandrogen withdrawal response . A washout period require patient respond antiandrogen prescribed second line hormonal therapy . For patient whose progression document PSA , last required PSA must require antiandrogen washout period ( 46 week appropriate ) . One prior docetaxelcontaining regimen . Patients must receive least 2 dos every 3week schedule 6 dos weekly schedule docetaxel . Patients may discontinue therapy due progression , intolerance , completion plan therapy , reason . Chemotherapy treatment secondline regimen permit . Patients previously treat firstline docetaxelbased doublet regimen eligible study , ( eg , patient treat prior firstline trial contain docetaxel/carboplatin docetaxelbased doublet ) . Serum testosterone level ( See protocol specific detail ) ( unless surgically castrate ) . Patients must continue androgen deprivation LHRH agonist undergone orchiectomy ECOG performance status Laboratory criterion entry : absolute neutrophil count platelet bilirubin AST ALT Life expectancy great 3 month Age great equal 18 year Agree use contraceptive study sexually active , 2 month last dose study drug .
