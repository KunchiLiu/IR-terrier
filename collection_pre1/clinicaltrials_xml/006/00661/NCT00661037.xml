	<brief_title>SAFEty Two Strategies ICD Management Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standardized requirement implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) include defibrillation testing ( DT ) , consist induction termination ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) . An effective DT historically consider part standard procedures implant . Nevertheless , implant technique technology evolve year nowadays deviation frequent clinical practice mainly due fact physicians seriously concern risk severe complication related DT . However , practice perform DT arbitrary safety yet unproven . This observational study assess safety two strategy adopt ICD implant : induction ( include patient undergo DT implant ) non-induction ( include patient undergo DT implant . No deviation centre ' current practice choose perform perform DT introduce study protocol . The study considers consecutive patient undergo first implant ICD</detailed_description>
