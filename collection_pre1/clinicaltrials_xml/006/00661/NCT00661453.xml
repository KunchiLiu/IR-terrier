	<brief_title>CARNIVAL Type I : Valproic Acid Carnitine Infants With Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) Type I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) genetic disorder result severe muscle weakness . It one common condition cause muscle weakness child . Patients SMA often develop weakness baby young child . Most people SMA gradually lose muscle strength ability time . Babies severe infantile form SMA , SMA type I , usually lose ability strength quickly week month . Valproic acid ( VPA ) medicine use many year treat patient epilepsy . Recent research suggest VPA may able upregulate expression backup copy SMN gene SMA patient cell line . In addition , preliminary data suggests may prolong survival animal model SMA . Because VPA deplete carnitine child SMA Type I , carnitine add help prevent possible toxicity . In multi-center trial , evaluate effect VPA/carnitine infant SMA type I . A variety outcome measure , include assessment safety , perform study visit follow course disease . The protocol include two baseline visit period two week , two clinical assessment medication 3 6 month , 6 month additional followup via telephone . Total duration study approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>

Use medication supplement within 30 day study enrollment interfere VPA carnitine metabolism ; increase potential risk VPA carnitine ; hypothesize beneficial effect SMA animal model human neuromuscular disorder , include riluzole , valproic acid , hydroxyurea , oral use albuterol , sodium phenylbutyrate , butyrate derivative , creatinine , growth hormone , anabolic steroid , probenecid , oral parenteral use corticosteroid entry , agent anticipated increase decrease muscle strength agent presume histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibition . Infants participate treatment trial SMA within 30 day study entry become enrollee treatment trial course study . Unwillingness travel study assessment . Coexisting medical condition contradict use VPA/carnitine travel study site .</criteria>
