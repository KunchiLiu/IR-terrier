	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Decitabine People With Thalassemia Intermedia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalassemias inherit blood disorder characterize low level hemoglobin healthy red blood cell , lead anemia . There many different type thalassemia , TI one type . People TI often moderate severe anemia may shorten life span , organ damage , low quality life result disease . Decitabine medication use treat people disease affect bone marrow blood cell . The medication may effective treatment people TI may ability interact person 's DNA increase hemoglobin level . Previous study people anemia show decitabine increase hemoglobin level participant . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness decitabine increase hemoglobin level people TI . This study enroll people TI . Following 8-week screening period , participant attend baseline study visit , include blood collection , pregnancy test , physical exam , echocardiogram heart image procedure . Decitabine inject skin abdomen , thigh , upper arm . Participants observe minimum 30 minute injection ass pain adverse reaction . Participants receive low dos decitabine twice week , consecutive day , 12 week . They closely monitor dosage adjust stop need . Every 2 week , participant undergo blood collection safety test . Every 4 week , participant attend study visit pregnancy test , physical exam , blood collection , review medication effect . Additionally , Week 12 visit , repeat echocardiogram occur . During Weeks 12 24 , participant receive decitabine injection attend monthly study visit repeat test . Study researcher contact participant phone every 3 month Year 1 every 6 month duration study collect long-term survival medical information .</detailed_description>
