	<brief_summary>Patients uveal melanoma metastatic liver treat embolization hepatic artery every 4 week . GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony simulate factor ) normal saline inject one liver arteries oily contrast dye , Ethiodol . This follow blockage artery small piece gelatin sponge ( embolization ) . It hop novel approach : - tumor cell die due loss blood supply , - local inflammatory reaction induce GM-CSF kill remain tumor cell , - systemic immune response tumor cell may develop .</brief_summary>
