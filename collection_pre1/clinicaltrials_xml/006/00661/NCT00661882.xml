	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Develop Integrated Biomedical Computing Tools ( IBCT ) well understanding treatment pancreatic cancer use power computer informatics science . - Continue development Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry ( PCCR ) infrastructure act repository socio-demographic , environmental , clinical , family history data collect individual interested family member personal and/or family history pancreatic cancer . - Participate international pancreatic registry know PCCR share information collect research purpose , use pancreatic cancer research collaborator institution . - Collect bank excess biological material ( i.e. , pancreatic tissue , tumor tissue , and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer tissue , and/or paraffin-embedded tissue ) , blood , serum registry participant future research . - Establish infrastructure core data element standardize operating procedure specimen collection , processing , storage EDRN Pancreatic Cancer Working Group project use resource development biomarkers early detection pancreatic adenocarcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo blood pancreatic tissue collection . Normal , tumor , and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer tissue , and/or paraffin-embedded tissue prior surgery biopsy obtain . Patients provide complete personal information , medical history , diet lifestyle habit , past current environmental exposure , re-create family tree cancer occur family member . Clinical data collect annually . Control participants provide blood sample complete questionnaire baseline . Clinical data collect annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient per group ( i.e. , cancer case , healthy control , acute biliary obstruction case , chronic pancreatitis case ) total 240 patient accrue EDRN portion study . A total ~5,000 patient accrue PCCR portion study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Patients must meet 1 follow criterion : Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas Resectable stage IIIA disease stage IIB high disease Must undergone complete surgical resection tumor curative intent Pancreatic mass ( solid ) less 4 cm determine conventional imaging ( MRI , EUS , CT scan ) No evidence extension mass beyond pancreas include vascular invasion invasion surround organ , exception bile duct No image evidence metastatic disease lymphadenopathy ( lymph node great 1 cm and/or appearance suspicious advanced lesion image criterion ) Has family history pancreatic cancer consider atrisk individual disease ( i.e. , member family 2 individual pancreatic cancer ) Control participants must meet 1 follow criterion : Chronic pancreatitis OR history exocrine insufficiency meeting follow criterion : At least 2 follow criterion meet ( unless patient history pancreatic exocrine insufficiency case 1 criterion must meet ) : Abdominal ultrasound consistent chronic pancreatitis standard radiological criterion ( i.e. , echogenic focus parenchyma , large small cavity , calcification , dilate pancreatic duct ) Abdominal CT scan consistent chronic pancreatitis standard radiological criterion ( i.e. , calcification , dilate pancreatic duct , irregular contour gland , cystic lesion ) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography exam consistent chronic pancreatitis standard radiological criterion ( i.e. , dilate tortuous main pancreatic duct irregular secondary branch intraductal calculus ) Endoscopic ultrasound consistent chronic pancreatitis standard radiological criterion ( i.e. , echogenic focus , focal region decrease echogenicity , pancreatic ductal change ) Pancreatic calcification identify plain film abdomen Must image study pancreas within 3 month study enrollment suggest pancreatic mass Stable clinical history past year suspicion cancer due weight loss , jaundice , change abdominal symptom No family history pancreatic cancer Acute biliary obstruction ( stone ) include jaundice benign etiology meeting follow criterion : Elevation serum bilirubin level great 2.0 mg/dL Dilated extrahepatic biliary system demonstrate US , MRI , CT scan Blood sample available within 72 hour admission prior corrective intervention Biliary obstruction must benign etiology common bile duct stone benign biliary stricture Must complete image study perform pancreas suggest pancreatic cancer ( i.e. , discrete mass lesion ) No family history pancreatic cancer Healthy control meeting follow criterion : Age , race , sexmatched qualified pancreatic cancer case No family history pancreatic cancer No personal history acute pancreatitis biliary obstruction ( stone ) include jaundice benign etiology No concurrent abdominal pain No concurrent unexplained weight loss PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : No prior malignancy , except nonmelanoma skin cancer , 10 year PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics No prior preoperative chemoradiotherapy ( neoadjuvant )</criteria>
