	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate fomepizole ( 4-methylpyrazole ) treat symptom associate alcohol intolerance due aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2 ) Deficiency , inherit metabolic disorder . These symptom include flush , nausea , headache , shortness breath dizziness , result exposure acetaldehyde , primary metabolite ethanol . Long-term , serious health risk associate repeated exposure acetaldehyde , carcinogen , among ALDH2-deficient individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIa Study Fomepizole Acetaldehyde Toxicity After Ethanol Exposure Subjects With Altered Ethanol Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 32 subject enrol ascend dose cohort 8 subject . Each subject receive oral dose study drug ( fomepizole placebo ) concomitant ethanol group assignment randomize 1:1:1:1 ratio ( 2 subject group ) Study Day 1 . Each subject intra-subject control alternative study drug ( fomepizole placebo ) administer next day ( Study Day 2 ) . Four subject cohort receive study drug ( fomepizole placebo ) administer 30 minute prior ethanol , 4 study drug ( fomepizole placebo ) administer 30 minute ethanol . The study assess safety tolerability fomepizole PK/PD 4-MP , ethanol acetaldehyde subject population .</detailed_description>
