	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether CollaRx Bupivacaine Implant ( bupivacaine sponge ) safe effective reducing amount narcotic pain medication need control pain first 24 hour gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety A Collagen Bupivacaine Implant Patients After Gastrointestinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery encompass range surgical procedure involve abdominal incision . Gastrointestinal surgery may perform treat abdominal aortic aneurysm , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , gallbladder disease , bile duct disease morbid obesity . Although less invasive laparoscopic procedure perform warrant , open abdominal surgery require certain indication complicate advanced case . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medicine ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery . This study compare amount narcotic pain medication require surgery patient receive CollaRx Bupivacaine implant plain collagen sponge .</detailed_description>
