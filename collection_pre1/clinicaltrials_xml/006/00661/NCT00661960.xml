	<brief_summary>This research do study immune system small intestine improve take antiretroviral ( anti-HIV ) medication . The main purpose measure increase number immune cell intestine see one type HIV medication give different result type HIV medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Project Virologic Immunologic Correlates GALT Immune Reconstitution Following Raltegravir Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While world-wide AIDS epidemic continue impact million individual , effective anti-HIV medication substantially reduce morbidity mortality patient able adhere combination regimen . Despite improved survival , durable virologic suppression , increase peripheral CD4+T-cell count patient receive potent antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , immune reconstitution remain incomplete measure number additional surrogate marker . Perhaps critically important among area apparent incomplete immune recovery gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , CD4+T-cells repopulate slowly , . Raltegravir new ART agent novel class HIV inhibitor , integrase inhibitor , result rapid suppression HIV recovery peripheral CD4+T-cells . This project propose examine whether volunteer receive raltegravir recover GALT immune cell completely take comparator ART .</detailed_description>
