	<brief_summary>In retrospective study , acceleration hepatic fibrosis see Nevirapine ( NVP ) treatment compare Protease Inhibitors ( PI ) boost ritonavir treatment patient Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection . The high incidence country HIV-HCV co-infection , availability new Kaletra ( LPV/r ) formulation ( convenient well tolerate soft capsule ) well possibility analyze hepatic fibrosis evolution fast bloodless way , make attractive study , prospective way , could check benefit substitute NVP LPV/r hepatic fibrosis community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial About Hepatic Security Antiretroviral Treatment Based Kaletra Versus Nevirapine co-Infected HIV/HCV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence HIV-HCV co-infection Spain one high infection strongly related parenteral drug use ; , 61 69 % HIV infect patient also HCV infect . Acute HCV infection asymptomatic 60 70 % case , chronification natural illness evolution . 20 % patient develop hepatic cirrhosis 20 30 year infected HCV . In cirrhosis case , hepatocellular carcinoma appear rate 2 4 % per year , accord study do HCV mono-infected patient . Fibrosis progression depend basically duration HCV infection age infection , also factor , like gender ( faster men ) , alcohol consumption ( bad 50 g per day ) HIV co-infection . Several epidemiologist study describe negative impact HIV co-infection , accelerate progression cirrhosis hepatocarcinoma . The Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment ( HAART ) positive impact survival co-infected patient , although three drug family use HAART cause hepatic toxicity group patient . Hepatic toxicity appear 5 20 % patient , serious common , exclusive , case NVP treatment . On part , PI hepatotoxic profile . An association serious hepatotoxicity ritonavir full strength , indinavir indinavir plus saquinavir boost ritonavir found . As far fibrosis concerned , study show HIV/HCV co-infected patient PI-based regimen associate low progression fibrosis , progression rate cirrhosis high NVP-based regimen , mainly patient advance hepatic fibrosis . Hepatic biopsy consider reference test ass hepatic fibrosis , nevertheless invasive , painful low potentially serious risk patient 's life . Moreover , viability hepatic biopsy doubt due sample error interobservation variability . For reason , several biochemist test develop reflect hepatic fibrosis extent stage reliable way . Recently hepatic rigidity measure elastography present non-invasive promising method ass hepatic fibrosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 18 year old elder . 2 . HCV HIV coinfected patient . 3 . Patients antiretroviral treatment base NVP plus 2 NRTIs ( 1 NRTI Tenofovir ) , undetectable viral load ( 50 copies/mL ) least last 24 week . 4 . If woman childbearing age , negative pregnancy test . Furthermore , barrier contraceptive method must undertake study . 5 . Date signature inform consent . 1 . Concomitant treatment drug significantly interact study drug . 2 . Opportunistic infection last 6 month . 3 . Patients candidate HCV infection treatment next 3 year . 4 . Patients efficacy previous NRTIs ensure . For example , patient mono dual therapy history previous blip NRTIrelated mutation identify could reduce sensibility use backbone . 5 . Active alcohol consumption ( 50 g per day ) substance abuse . 6 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 7 . Patients transaminase level 5 time Upper Limit Normality ( ULN ) Creatinin 2 mg/dL Total Bilirubin 3 time ULN . 8 . Any formal contraindication treat study drug . 9 . Patients , base antiretroviral treatment history , could consider infected virus sensibility LPV .</criteria>
