	<brief_title>Evaluating People With Thalassemia : The Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort ( TLC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalassemias inherit blood disorder characterize low level hemoglobin healthy red blood cell . The two major type thalassemia alpha thalassemia beta thalassemia , several form type . Symptoms range mild severe may include anemia , delayed growth , bone problem , enlarge spleen . People mild form disease may need treatment , people moderate severe thalassemia may treat blood transfusion refresh healthy red blood cell supply , iron chelation therapy remove excess iron body , folic acid supplement help build healthy red blood cell . Stem cell transplant cure disease , widely use difficulty find donor . This study establish database people thalassemia people use thalassemia examine prevalence incidence complication related disease . Participants ' DNA analyze plasma collect use future study . Participants study may also ask interested enrol Thalassemia Clinical Research Network study . This study enrol people thalassemia people whose thalassemia cure undergoing stem cell transplant . At baseline study visit , participant thalassemia undergo medical history interview ; medical record review ; blood collection ; questionnaires quality life , nutritional status , medication adherence . Follow-up visit occur year least 3 year duration study include repeat baseline testing . Participants undergone successful stem cell transplant attend one study visit include medical history interview , medical record review , quality life questionnaire .</detailed_description>
