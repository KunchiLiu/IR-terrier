	<brief_summary>The main objective evaluate treatment inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) affect characteristics airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) cell asthmatic subject . Our hypothesis airway smooth muscle cell dysfunction play important role pathogenesis asthma , treatment inhaled corticosteroid reverse abnormality airway smooth muscle cell function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims Objectives Most work publish date effect steroid ASM carry animal model vitro experiment . We would like evaluate vivo whether abnormality ASM function respond ICS . Because ASM cell obtain bronchial biopsy obtain via bronchoscopy , examine endobronchial biopsy corticosteroid-naïve , mild asthmatic subject . In particular , examine whether ICS effect ASM mass , proliferation expression different contractile protein ( α-actin myosin ) chemokines , assess vitro response ASM cell stimulation TGF-β IL-1β . We also examine effect dexamethasone chemokine release induced proliferation vitro treatment ICS . We examine effect inhaled corticosteroid 12 subject mild asthma . The subject study baseline period receive treatment inhale corticosteroid therapy Budesonide Turbohaler ( 400 ug bd ) 4 week . The result two period compare . There 5 study visit . In first two visit , subject undergo spirometry reversibility testing , methacholine challenge test , skin prick test IgE level , measurement exhale nitric oxide , subject complete Asthma Control Questionnaire Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire . The third visit day admission bronchoscopy . They give asthma control diary card complete 4-week treatment ICS receive ICS turbohaler . At visit 4 , repeat spirometry methacholine challenge ass change secondary treatment ICS . The final visit second bronchoscopy , dairy card ICS inhaler collect , subject complete Asthma Control Quality Life questionnaire .</detailed_description>
