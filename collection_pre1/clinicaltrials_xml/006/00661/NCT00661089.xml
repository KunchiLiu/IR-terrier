	<brief_title>Randomized DB Controlled Trial Botulinum Toxin A Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects shoulder pain spasticity shoulder follow stroke result hemiplegia eligible participation . Following initial screen visit involve history physical examination , subject enter study significant spasticity shoulder internal rotation/adduction associate pain rat least 4 VAS pain . Subjects also give cognitive screening ask rate pain hypothetical situation . Shoulder pain frequent complication follow hemiplegic stroke , may result disability . Spasticity also complication follow stroke . Botulinum toxin use treatment post-stroke spasticity may also pain modulate effect . Participants study ask make total 6 visit period approximately 13 week . Eligible subject randomize 100 200 unit botulinum toxin type inject pectoralis major second visit . If significant spasticity shoulder extension , subject also receive injection teres major . Subjects follow assessment pain , functioning , active passive range motion depression follow initial injection . At 12 week post injection visit , blind broken subject initially inject placebo inject active drug . This do give subject opportunity receive active drug , well assess effect difference delay treatment . All subject return 4 week later repeat assessment . Subjects call one year post study enrollment repeat pain rating information regard subsequent treatment .</detailed_description>
