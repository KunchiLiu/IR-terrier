	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) sudden , unexpected loss heart function . It lead cause death , 400,000 people United States die year result SCA . This study analyze genetic sample people experience SCA people experience SCA determine genetic basis SCA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Genetic Factors That May Lead Sudden Cardiac Arrest ( The GenSCA Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCA occur heart suddenly unexpectedly stops beating . When happen , blood stop flow brain vital organ . Ninety-five percent people experience SCA die , within minute . SCA usually cause abnormal heart rhythm , know arrhythmia , trigger several factor , include coronary artery disease , physical stress , structural change heart . Certain genetic factor may also increase likelihood experience SCA . Study researcher analyze genetic sample people affect SCA people unaffected SCA identify characterize genetic variation associate increase risk SCA European Americans African Americans . This study examine previously collect blood sample people experience SCA participant Cardiac Arrest Blood Study ( CABS ) Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) . These participant attend study visit contact study researcher . People experience SCA first 4 year study blood draw paramedic time SCA . If participant survive , ask whether study researcher review medical record . Study researcher also examine previously collect blood sample participant experience SCA participant CABS , CHS , Heart Vascular Health Study . These participant attend study visit contact study researcher . Study researcher also enroll new control group people experience SCA . These participant attend one study visit blood collection medical record review .</detailed_description>
