	<brief_summary>In study , subject vaccinate meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine previous study ( whose objective &amp; outcome measure present separate protocol post NCT number = 00227422 ) vaccinate new vaccine use conjugation technology . These subject compare subject vaccinate new vaccine , previously vaccinate meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison GSK134612 Subjects Previously Vaccinated Against Meningococcal Disease Versus Non-vaccinated Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK Biologicals develop meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( GSK134612 ) . This candidate vaccine show well tolerate immunogenic toddler , child age 3-5 year , adolescents/young adult . Repeated vaccination unconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine show induce hyporesponsiveness re-vaccination , serogroup C , recent publication suggest may true serogroups . This study evaluate GSK Biologicals ' candidate vaccine 's ability induce satisfactory immune response serogroups contain across subject 4.5 34 year age previously receive tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine age 2-30 year . A non-randomised age-strata match group subject , previously receive ( receive within precede 10 year ) meningococcal vaccine , also administer GSK134612 vaccine comparison .</detailed_description>
