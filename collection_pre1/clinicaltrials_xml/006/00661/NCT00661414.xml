	<brief_title>Safety Study ASONEP ( Sonepcizumab/LT1009 ) Treat Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ASONEP™ ( sonepcizumab/LT1009 ) humanize monoclonal antibody possess anti-angiogenic anti-tumor activity animal model human cancer . ASONEP™ bind sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P ) , bioactive lipid signal molecule posse potent pro-growth effect . Preclinical study ASONEP™ ( sonepcizumab/LT1009 ) LT1002 ( murine homolog LT1009 ) , demonstrate potential anti-S1P treatment reduce tumor volume metastatic potential , likely result inhibit new blood vessel formation need support tumor growth . Lpath develop ASONEP™ ( sonepcizumab/LT1009 ) follow therapeutic indication : ASONEP™ [ parenteral sonepcizumab ( LT1009 ) treatment cancer ] indicate use combination TBD cytotoxic agent anti-angiogenic agent second-line therapy treat patient unresectable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic TBD cancer .</detailed_description>
