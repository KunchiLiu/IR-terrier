	<brief_title>Recording Heart Signals From Chest Wall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanical functionality cardiovascular system govern complex interplay pressure gradient , determine contraction force myocardial cell , dynamic blood flow compliance cardiac chamber blood vessel . These mechanical process produce vibration acoustic signal record chest wall . Vibro-acoustic heart signal , include heart sound ( phonocardiogram ) , apical pulse ( apexcardiogram ) arterial pulse ( e.g . carotid pulse ) carry valuable clinical information , use mostly limit qualitative assessment manual method [ 1 ] ( Figure 1 ) . The primary research hypothesis work clinical information regard mechanical functionality cardiovascular system automatically extract vibro-acoustic heart signal combine medical algorithms digital signal processing technique computational learn algorithm . The utilization vibro-acoustic signal clinical diagnosis monitoring , mean computerized device , overlook many year due introduction sophisticate image technique echocardiography , cardiac CT cardiac MRI . However , valuable technique require complex expensive equipment , well expert operator interpreter . In particular , image technique use continuously outside hospital environment . Recent advancement sensor technology , wireless communication miniaturization high-performance compute device enable re-approach analysis mechanical heart signal use broad interdisciplinary view . The research methodology achieve goal trial follow : 1 . Vibro-acoustic heart signal include phonocardiogram , apexcardiogram carotid pulse record subject undergoing dialysis/medicinal Treatment . 2 . The correlation progress dialysis/medicinal treatment process change temporal morphological characteristic vibro-acoustic signal investigate . 3 . Signal processing algorithm use automatically analyze vibro-acoustic signal . The recorded signal save digitally hard-disk recording system , along measure reference parameter . Signal processing method [ 2 ] [ 3 ] use segment signal distinct component extract temporal morphological feature . Statistical linear regression use identify significant correlation feature vibro-acoustic signal reference parameter . Computational learn algorithm use explore non-linear relation evaluate potential estimate hemodynamic index vibro-acoustic signal . This study intend evaluate novel method non-invasive estimation cardiac index reflect mechanical functionality heart . Modern digital signal processing technique efficient computational learning algorithm combine attain automatic real-time processing vibro-acoustic signal continuous monitor cardiac functionality early detection cardiac pathology .</detailed_description>
