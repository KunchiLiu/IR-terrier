	<detailed_description>Patients continue smoke ACS 35 % increase risk reinfarction death compare quit . Many patient attempt stop smoking acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , relapse rate approach 66 % . A variety smoke cessation aid show effective general population . However , physician reluctant use nicotine-based therapy hemodynamic effect . Bupropion non-nicotine replacement therapy show improve abstinence rate healthy young smoker approximately 50 % . Although bupropion successfully use reduce smoke rate healthy young population , efficacy safety set patient recover ACS unknown . The ZESCA Trial directly compare efficacy safety bupropion versus placebo mean reduce smoke rate patient follow ACS . The ZESCA Trial multi-center effort , coordinate Jewish General Hospital/McGill University ( Montreal , Quebec ) . A total 1500 patient randomize follow ACS hospital discharge via Internet web site . Prior start treatment , patient treatment arm receive standard physician-administered counseling session regard smoke cessation . Patients begin treatment in-hospital monitor in-hospital ≥ 2 day prior discharge . Half patient receive bupropion 9 week half receive placebo pill 9 week . Patients receive bupropion take 150 mg per day 3 day 150 mg twice per day remainder 9 week . Prior discharge , patient receive information sheet listing possible side effect bupropion . They advise consult treat physician experience list side effect . While in-hospital , patient quit smoke instruct restart smoke discharge . Phone call patient make study nurse week 1 2 9-week treatment period . In addition , patient clinic visit week 4 9 well month 6 12 . Smoking abstinence assess 4 week , 9 week , 6 month , 12 month randomization . Smoking abstinence define complete abstinence week prior clinic visit level exhale carbon monoxide ≤ 10 ppm . Side effect bupropion patient follow ACS well clinical event follow initiation treatment measure week 1-8 ( telephone call ) , week 4 9 well month 6 12 ( clinic visit ) . Withdrawal symptom also assess nurse weekly call . Trials previously conduct bupropion involve young healthy smoker . The ZESCA trial first examine utility bupropion group patient ACS . These patient , continue smoke , exceptionally high risk recurrent cardiac event . If bupropion effective population , major impact secondary prevention recurrent clinical event patient suffer ACS .</detailed_description>
