	<brief_summary>Cystic lesion pancreas define round , fluid-filled structure within pancreas detect radiologic imaging . With widespread use cross-sectional imaging modality various indication , lesion detect nearly 20 % abdominal imaging , majority discover incidentally . These lesion encompass wide spectrum histopathologic entity biologic behavior , range benign malignant . Substantial morphologic overlap restrict accuracy diagnose specific type cystic lesion spite recent advance diagnostic modality . It challenge issue differentiate cystic lesion make management plan since cystic lesion relatively common asymptomatic may possess malignant potential . Although inflammatory pseudocysts think account 80-90 % cystic lesion pancreas , cystic tumor account remaining,10 latter may occur much frequently traditionally estimate . To date , surgical resection generally recommend malignant potentially malignant lesion . However , surgical resection pancreas still carry substantial morbidity sometimes mortality , especially cystic lesion locate head portion . Therefore , management individualize risk-benefit analysis patient . Recently , pilot study EUS-guided ethanol lavage cystic tumor pancreas report complete resolution achieve one-third patient even though epithelial line ablation demonstrate resected specimen . Therefore , effective treatment modality ablation agent require improve treatment response . Intratumoral intraperitoneal injection chemotherapeutic agent use endobronchial lesion lung cancer , brain tumor advance ovarian cancer.13-16 EUS-guided injection antitumor material report advanced pancreatic cancer . Although local injection chemotherapeutic agent pancreatic cystic tumor yet report , reasonable suggest approach may additive effect ablation epithelial lining cystic tumor combine ethanol lavage . Paclitaxel , widely use chemotherapeutic agent , inhibits cell process dependent microtubule turnover . Due highly hydrophobic nature,19 paclitaxel expect exert effect longer instill within closed cavity cyst . The hydrophobic viscous nature paclitaxel may reduce possibility leak puncture site cause complication . The present study evaluate safety , feasibility response follow EUS-guided ethanol lavage paclitaxel injection ( EUS-EP ) treat cystic tumor pancreas .</brief_summary>
