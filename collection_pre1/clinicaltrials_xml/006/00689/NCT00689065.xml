	<brief_summary>Rationale : CALAA-01 targeted therapeutic design inhibit tumor growth and/or reduce tumor size . The active ingredient CALAA-01 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . This siRNA inhibits tumor growth via RNA interference reduce expression M2 subunit ribonucleotide reductase ( R2 ) . The CALAA-01 siRNA protect nuclease degradation within stabilized nanoparticle target tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial : - Determine safety , toxicity , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CALAA-01 administer intravenously patient relapse refractory cancer . - Characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) CALAA-01 intravenous administration . - Provide preliminary evidence efficacy intravenous CALAA-01 evaluate tumor response . - Recommend dose intravenous CALAA-01 future clinical study . - Evaluate immune response , measure antibody cytokine level , effect intravenous CALAA-01 complement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CALAA-01 target nanocomplex contains anti-R2 siRNA . The complete nanocomplex formulation consist four component : 1. duplex synthetic , non-chemically-modified siRNA ( C05C ) 2. cyclodextrin-containing polymer ( CAL101 ) , 3. stabilizing agent ( AD-PEG ) , 4. target agent ( AD-PEG-Tf ) contain human transferrin protein ( Tf ) . The cationic polymer interacts electrostatically anionic siRNA assemble nanocomplexes approximately 100 nm diameter protect siRNA nuclease degradation serum . The siRNA-containing nanocomplexes target cell express transferrin receptor ( TfR ) . Upon reach target cell , transferrin bind TfRs cell surface siRNA-containing nanocomplex enters cell endocytosis . Inside cell , chemistry build polymer achieves unpackaging siRNA nanocomplex , permit function via RNA interference .</detailed_description>
