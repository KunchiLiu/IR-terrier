	<brief_summary>I hypothesize absorbable screw fixation foot 's Lisfranc ligament yield significant difference postoperative foot stability , ligament function , symptom compare steel screw fixation . In addition , absorbable screw fixation Lisfranc ligaments offer advantage second surgical procedure remove screw necessary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Steel Bioabsorbable Screw Fixation Lisfranc Foot Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Lisfranc ligament group ligament connect bone middle portion foot . The Lisfranc ligament allow normal stable range motion shape foot . When Lisfranc ligament disrupt , stability give middle foot lose . Attempted activity foot result pain abnormal motion . If injury Lisfranc ligament leave untreated , eventual end result foot arthritis deformity . The current standard orthopaedic treatment Lisfranc ligament injury surgery . The Lisfranc ligament fix compress space middle bone foot steel screw . These screw allow ligament healing . As ligament heal , patient resume activity fix foot soon screw may break . A second surgical procedure often recommend remove screw 6 month surgery . This allow complete return normal foot range motion , cost second procedure . The use material absorb human body fix Lisfranc ligament study 1 paper . One material Smart Screw ( Bionx , Blue Bell , Pennsylvania ) approve Food Drug Administration ( F.D.A . ) make polylevolactic acid ( PLA ) . Absorbable screw could ideal treatment Lisfranc ligament injury . Comparing long-term result fix Lisfranc ligament either steel absorbable screw important study subject date . There 1 publish study regard absorbable screw fix Lisfranc ligament . The purpose study compare outcome steel absorbable screw fixation Lisfranc ligaments foot injury one surgeon 's ( J.A . ) practice Thomas Jefferson University Hospital , Riddle Memorial Hospital , Nazareth Hospital . This study conduct prospective manner . This study focus experimental procedure component , rather involve accepted management select population patient . This study perform randomize , prospective manner involve 2 group patient ( steel vs. bioabsorbable screw population ) 3 different hospital . Power analysis conduct ensure adequate patient population size . The risk patient minimal . The standard risk fix Lisfranc ligament include bleeding , infection , nerve injury , recurrent foot instability , danger administer anesthesia . Study Groups Chosen patient study randomly assign one two group . Group A consist patient receive steel screw . Group B contain patient receive absorbable screw . Postoperative activity restriction rehabilitation keep two group . Routine protocols care foot fracture patient utilized regard infection , wound care , pain control , weightbearing restriction . The involved foot place non-weight-bearing splint patient request avoid handle remove PI upon first postoperative visit . Patients injury fix use steel screw , need second surgery 6 month removal screw . This standard textbook treatment revision surgery . Patients receive absorbable screw , wont need surgery . This discussed patient time approach recruitment . Outcome evaluation The PI monitor follow patient surgery . Data collection include detail surgery , intraoperative postoperative course include complication applicable , number revision surgery perform occur . These patient receive postoperative follow-up 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year , 3 year . Both group patient prohibit bear weight affect foot six week . Patients instruct gradually increase weight-bearing start six week . Postoperative satisfaction function score accord American Orthopaedic Foot Ankle Society ( AOFAS ) Midfoot scale highly accepted validity , reliability , reproducibility . Patients also ask satisfaction surgical result use 10 cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) four-point scale ( poor , mild , good , excellent ) . Observed complication include need revision surgery would document . All information would gather patient ' follow-up visit outpatient clinic surgery . For patient receive steel screw , receive second outpatient surgical procedure 6-month postoperative follow-up remove screw use current standard orthopaedic technique . Postoperative foot X-rays patient follow outpatient setting also examine view proper alignment compression middle portion foot together indicate heal Lisfranc ligament . Radiographs use evaluate screw breakage . In case absorbable screw , radiograph also do assess absorption .</detailed_description>
