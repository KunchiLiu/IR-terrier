	<detailed_description>Background Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) increasingly use treatment variety malignant non-malignant condition . With improvement condition regimen post-transplant care , HSCT recipients become long-term survivor therefore increase attention direct study long-term consequence successful HSCT . Iron overload surprisingly common HSCT . The pathophysiology iron overload siderosis relate transfusional iron , inhibition normal erythropoiesis release iron store hepatocytes , tumour cell bone marrow . It associate chronic liver disease patient population , well increase rate infection . Studies suggest iron overload may also affect survival population , show population susceptible iron overload thalassemia hereditary hemochromatosis ( 1,2 ) . McKay et al . describe 76 survivor allogeneic autologous HSCT least 1 year post-transplant ( 3 ) . Sixty-seven ( 88 % ) ferritin level normal range . Thirty-one ( 41 % ) abnormal liver enzymes 30/31 also elevate ferritin . At time publication , 10 patient begin venesection program ; show reduction ferritin level nine patient reduction alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) . Strasser et al . show increase hepatic iron concentration 10 consecutive patient die post-HSCT ( 4 ) . In retrospective study determine characteristic chronic liver disease post-HSCT , iron overload felt contribute chronic liver dysfunction 52.4 % patient post-HSCT liver disease ( 5 ) . Iron overload also associate increased frequency infection HSCT recipient . A single-centre retrospective study autopsy conduct post-HSCT reveal association high liver iron concentration invasive Aspergillus infection ( 6 ) . In consecutive series 263 allogeneic HSCT patient , 5 case mucormycosis occur patient severe iron overload ( 7 ) . Iron overload prior transplantation may also negative effect survival . In prospective study 25 consecutive patient , Altes et al . show high ferritin level high transferrin saturation prior condition associate decreased overall survival high transferrin saturation associate increase transplant-related mortality ( 8 ) . Therapeutic phlebotomy well-established treatment iron overload associate hereditary hemochromatosis ( 9 ) beta thalassemia HSCT ( 10 ) . Phlebotomy also study survivor acute leukemia iron overload . Franchini et al . show phlebotomy feasible well-tolerated population result normalization ferritin transferrin saturation ( 11 ) . This study demonstrate feasibility phlebotomy effect iron reduction end-organ function address . In summary , iron overload common follow HSCT associate number adverse biochemical clinical outcome . In clinical setting hereditary hemochromatosis transfusional iron overload state thalassemia , reduction iron store phlebotomy chelation unequivocally demonstrate reduce morbidity mortality . We therefore postulate reduction iron overload HSCT similarly associate low morbidity mortality . Objectives 1. demonstrate safety feasibility phlebotomy reduce total body iron HSCT recipients 2. demonstrate reduction total body iron reduce ferritin transferrin saturation reduction hepatic cardiac iron 3. demonstrate improvement end-organ function improve hepatic , cardiac endocrine function . Study Design This prospective , single arm phase II trial design evaluate safety efficacy decrease total body iron HSCT recipient phlebotomy . Study Intervention Patients eligible participate give inform consent undergo regimen phlebotomy follow manner . Starting 60 day post-transplant , patient undergo phlebotomy 500 mL whole blood monthly total 12 treatment . There determination complete blood count prior phlebotomy hemoglobin level less 100 g/L , phlebotomy perform . Patients routinely receive crystalloid volume replacement follow phlebotomy . However , patient experience syncope pre-syncope , subsequent phlebotomy follow infusion 500 mL normal saline . Assessment Safety Feasibility The safety feasibility regular phlebotomy determine assess proportion patient complete 12 planned phlebotomy . Delays phlebotomy reason stop phlebotomy program document . At visit , patient comprehensive assessment prior start complete phlebotomy . This assessment include determination pain phlebotomy site , local infection assessment symptom anemia include presyncope , fatigue dyspnea . The patient 's pulse , blood pressure , respiratory rate temperature also determine follow phlebotomy . Assessment Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In study , adverse event felt related study procedure record . Phlebotomy adverse event include : Pain phlebotomy site , infection phlebotomy site , evidence phlebitis , fatigue , presyncope , syncope , dyspnea , bacteremia , cellulitis phlebotomy site . A fall systolic blood pressure great 20 mmHg post-phlebotomy also consider adverse event . Only serious adverse event relate study procedure record . Patients carefully assess phlebotomy procedure . Adverse event serious adverse event relate study procedure assess throughout study 30 day follow last phlebotomy . Assessment Efficacy Determination iron concentration Iron store measure serially patient . Measurements perform prior start phlebotomy , 6 month 12 month follow start series 12 phlebotomy . These evaluation undertake regardless number phlebotomy patient actually undergoes . Iron store estimate measure serum ferritin transferrin saturation level . Total body iron estimate hepatic cardiac iron concentration measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Gandon et al . ( 12 ) describe non-invasive technique use MRI measure hepatic iron store . Iron paramagnetic substance cause local magnetic field inhomogeneity lead dephasing signal loss MRI . Gradient echo sequence susceptible effect use 180° refocus pulse , unlike conventional spin-echo sequence . Gandon et al . use multiple gradient echo sequence , compare signal liver adjacent muscle use ratio correlate hepatic iron level measure tissue biopsy sample use spectrophotometric analysis . Multiple sequence use nomogram compare L/M signal ratio linear small concentration tissue iron . The accuracy MRI technique subsequently verify Alustiza et al . ( 13 ) . They measure hepatic iron concentration 112 patient iron level vary normal ( n=68 ) abnormal patient hereditary hemochromatosis ( n=21 ) transfusional hemosiderosis ( n=23 ) . The correlation coefficient iron measure MRI compare tissue biopsy series 0.957 . This positive correlation verifies Gandon technique . Serum sample also collect baseline screen common mutation HFE gene ( C282Y mutation H63D mutation ) hereditary hemochromatosis common general population may contribute iron overload HSCT recipient . The patient family physician inform result hemochromatosis test standard practice follow . Determination end organ function The effect iron overload study three principal area : liver , heart endocrine organ . All measurement perform baseline 6 12 month follow start series 12 phlebotomy . Hepatic function determine measurement liver enzyme ( alkaline phosphatase , aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase ) liver function test include total bilirubin , albumin INR . Cardiac function determine magnetic resonance image serum brain natriuretic peptide troponin . Endocrine function determine measurement serum LH , FSH , TSH , free T4 , testosterone ( male ) fast glucose . Follow-up After completion trial , patient continue follow hematologist . If phlebotomy safe feasible , physician may choose continue phlebotomy would standard practice evidence support intervention time . Analysis The analysis result study descriptive . A screening log keep number patient screen study record . Patients eligible participate give inform consent describe accord follow parameter : age , gender , underlie indication transplant , type transplant , number red cell transfusion receive prior transplant , number red cell transfusion start condition study enrollment ECOG performance status time study entry . The feasibility intervention record describe proportion patient complete plan series 12 phlebotomy . In order consider patient unable complete 12 phlebotomy , total number actual phlebotomy conduct trial also record express proportion total number plan phlebotomy . The number phlebotomy per patient per time period also report . The efficacy intervention record describe change serum ferritin transferrin saturation , liver enzymes liver function , endocrine parameter liver cardiac iron store determine liver MRI . Cardiac function also determine study entry 6 12 month follow start series 12 planned phlebotomy . The safety intervention record evaluate number patient adverse and/or serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
