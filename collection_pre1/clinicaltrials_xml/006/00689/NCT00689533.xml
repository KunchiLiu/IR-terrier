	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To evaluate use unilateral bilateral VEPTR device , without expansion thoracoplasty , prevent progression Cobb angle , allow spinal growth improve pulmonary function treatment child progressive scoliosis without rib abnormality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEPTR Implantation Treat Children With Early Onset Scoliosis Without Rib Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Number Patients Planned : A total 250 patient require treatment VEPTR device meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study . All patient enrol study receive VEPTR device . Duration Follow-up : Patients clinically follow post-surgery throughout course patient 's treatment . Follow-up appointment schedule 1 , 6 , 12 month post-surgery every year thereafter 5 year index procedure , every 2 year final plan procedure , completion spinal growth ( typically 2 year menarche girl , equivalent boy ) , whichever occur first . Other patient visit may occur deem necessary . General Design Methodology : This prospective , multi-center , clinical study evaluate use VEPTR device prevent progression Cobb angle , measure curvature spine , determine measurement make radiograph , allow spinal growth improve pulmonary function treatment child progressive scoliosis without rib abnormality . Unilateral v . Bilateral , use opening wedge thoracostomy , discretion surgeon . The treatment would use regardless study , therefore routine care . The primary study hypothesis , regard key clinical radiographic outcome , success rate VEPTR device least 90 % . A secondary study hypothesis regard key pulmonary outcome ( improvement pulmonary function test increase lung volume measure CT scan ) , success rate VEPTR device least 90 % ( see Primary Study Endpoints ) . Details patient outcome study hypothesis give . With correction 10 % attrition , 250 patient split participate institution enrol . Primary Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint base finding include last scheduled patient follow-up visit . An individual patient 's treatment consider successful follow criterion meet : - The patient 's Cobb angle final surgery less equal patient 's pre-operative Cobb angle - The patient 's trunk height spinal length final surgery great equal patient 's immediate post-operative trunk height spinal length</detailed_description>
