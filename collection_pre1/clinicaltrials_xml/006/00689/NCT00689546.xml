	<detailed_description>Acute viral hepatitis usually self limited condition characterize typical course prodrome follow icteric phase . In case course may protract complicate development cholestatic phase acute liver failure . The development complicate course depend number factor type virus variety host factor include age infection , immune status host condition underlie liver onset hepatitis . Patients underlie chronic liver disease cirrhosis increase risk development decompensation liver relate death develop superinfection hepatotropic virus . Vento etal demonstrate classical study superinfection hepatitis A chronic liver disease associate high risk decompensation death . In India , since adult population include chronic liver disease show protective antibody HAV , infection rarely problem . Hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) demonstrate common cause acute hepatitis , acute liver failure subacute liver India . There enough data suggest HEV superinfection also commonest cause acute decompensation chronic liver disease Indian subcontinent . Many patient sign symptom preexist liver disease liver failure secondary HEV superinfection bring light underlie chronic liver disease . World , well develop country nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) fast emerge important cause chronic liver disease . Obesity diabetes two important risk factor NAFLD.It estimate would 366 million diabetes world 2030.Of 79.4 million India . Diabetes propose risk factor chronic liver disease HCC.The spectrum liver involvement range fatty liver , steatohepatitis , fibrosis cirrhosis . Even among patient NASH , presence diabetes annotate advanced stage fibrosis . There suggestion diabetic patient develop acute viral hepatitis may prolong course . Liver regeneration capacity demonstrate impaired among animal human fatty liver partial resection . It therefore possible diabetic NAFLD may poor regenerate capacity lead prolonged course hepatitis . It observation unit patient present acute chronic liver failure subacute hepatic failure diabetes . Whether simply co-existence two commonly occur disease ( diabetes prevalence 10 % Indian population hepatitis E endemic ( 1 ) country ) presence acute hepatitis E diabetic patient produce bad outcome compare hepatitis E non-diabetic patient . There fore important find natural course two commonly occur disease occur together separately . We hypothesize acute hepatitis infection prolong complicated course among diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
