	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritic change knee common cause pain restrict subject 's ability move may lead surgical intervention total knee replacement . Quadriceps muscle strengthen show improve dynamic stability knee , decrease pain locomotion increase knee function . However , gain associate improved quadriceps strength difficult achieve routine clinical basis currently available way increase muscle strength- voluntary exercise surface electrical stimulation- significant practical problem limit use . The aim prospective study evaluate safety effectiveness neuromuscular stimulation use implantable microstimulators call BIONs improve strength , range motion , health knee patient knee osteoarthritis . This investigation expect last 12 week study participant ; trial complete 3-year period . Patients recruit study advance knee osteoarthritis total knee replacement surgery consider . The propose study extend feasibility study carry Milan , Italy five patient knee osteoarthritis , implanted BIONs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Knee Osteoarthritis common problem people age 50 often debilitating challenge pose normal walk function . Research show exercise lessen effect osteoarthritis knee do diligently . BIONÂ®s implant thigh produce contraction quadriceps muscle without much movement knee joint , advantage move knee painful . In study , teh subject divide three group . Two group experimental subject receive stimulation use BIONs . The first group stimulation paradigm like use previous feasibility study precede propose trial , use low-frequency ( 1-5 PPS ) `` twitch '' stimulation . The second group stimulation paradigm tetanic-frequency stimulation ( 25-50 PPS ) use produce fused muscle contraction . A third group experimental subject standardize program voluntary exercise.. In Groups 1 2 , femoral nerve stimulate electrically accord assign protocol 12 week experimental period implantation device . Individuals assign Group 3 , receive conventional exercise therapy 12 week , allow receive BIONs end trial , provide request BION therapy least minimally compliant exercise . All participant eligible continue treatment follow initial 12 week medically appropriate resource permit .</detailed_description>
