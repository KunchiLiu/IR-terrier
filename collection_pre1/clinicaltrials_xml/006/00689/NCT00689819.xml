	<brief_summary>This project evaluate clinical cost effectiveness novel , multidisciplinary approach identify treat pre-clinical cardiac dysfunction ( PCCD ) asymptomatic hypertensive patient identify single center urban emergency department . Premature onset pressure-related cardiac complication hypertension ( especially heart failure ) important implication long-term survival , quality life healthcare cost . This project target patient already develop pressure-related cardiac structural abnormality yet remain symptom free . These individual tremendous risk progression clinically overt heart failure associate consequence . We hypothesize detection treatment patient hypertension pre-clinical structural cardiac damage enable forestallment disease process offer opportunity reduce burden cardiac morbidity associate hypertension . This project implement program prospectively identify PCCD ( use echocardiography ) provide treatment . At present , optimal blood pressure goal patient PCCD unknown study randomize patient 2 level blood pressure control : `` normal '' , consistent current national guideline `` intensive '' , aim markedly low blood pressure ( &lt; 120/80 ) . Enrolled patient receive active treatment follow-up 1 year . At end 1 year , evaluate : 1 ) ability program achieve blood pressure goal ; 2 ) cost effectiveness ; 3 ) proportion blood pressure group evidence disease regression echocardiography .</brief_summary>
