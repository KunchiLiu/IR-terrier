Because oral rehydration solution salty taste , many mild moderate dehydrate child refuse drink . This result pediatrician recommend inappropriate solution unnecessary administration intravenous fluid . Although two meta-analyses conclude rice-based ORS ( Enfalyte ) effective traditional ORS reduce stool output , palatability different oral rehydration solution never evaluate . This first prospective trial compare palatability commonly recommend oral rehydration solution , Pedialyte Enfalyte new solution , Pediatric Electrolyte . Both Pedialyte Pediatric Electrolyte contain sucralose , dextrose , fructose Enfalyte contain rice syrup solid . Although latter , effective Pedialyte reduce stool output , palatability may limit use . Taste important child gastroenteritis frequently nauseate may refuse drink vomit consume less palatable solution . We hypothesize , compare child receive rice-based ORS ( Enfalyte ) , receive sucralose ORS ( Pediatric Electrolyte Pedialyte ) report high mean taste score , prefer drink sucralose sweetened ORS consume large volume , likely drink entire volume provide .</detailed_description>
