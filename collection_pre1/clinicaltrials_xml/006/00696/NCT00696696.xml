	<brief_summary>This study test combination two targeted therapy , along chemotherapy treatment treatment pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gemcitabine Erlotinib Plus Sorafenib ( GES ) Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently , additional therapy pancreatic cancer target either vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) pathway , strategy show variable clinical efficacy . This inconsistency surprising , give knowledge tumor certain level signal redundancy may limit effectiveness one single-targeted therapy . The dual blockade EGF VEGF pathways take aim two active cascade tumorigenesis . Preliminarily , phase II study do pancreatic cancer gemcitabine , bevacizumab erlotinib cetuximab show promising result likely proceed phase III study definitive efficacy assessment ( Kindler et al , 2006 ) . In study , target blockade carry one step inhibition signal cascade downstream receptor tyrosine kinases level raf . Given fact majority pancreatic tumor display constitutive activation Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway , hop addition sorafenib gemcitabine erlotinib obtain complete blockade signal transduction cascade responsible pancreatic tumor growth progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma amenable curative treatment surgery . Patients locally advanced disease must disease extends outside boundary standard radiation port . Measurable disease , define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . This require least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Pleural effusion ascites consider measurable lesion . No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic disease . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy allow , however least 6 month must elapse administration last dose chemotherapy radiotherapy . No prior therapy VEGF , EGFR , multitargeted kinase inhibitor . Age &gt; 18 year . Life expectancy great 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 01 . Normal organ marrow function define : White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 3,000/µl Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µl Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Transaminases ( SGOT/ SGPT ) without liver mets ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN liver mets ≤ 5 x institutional ULN International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) patient warfarin ≤ 1.5 patient warfarin ≤ 3 Renal Function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 xULN Proteinuria : Urine protein &lt; 1+ , 24hr urine protein &lt; 500 mg At least 30 day since receive investigational drug . Patients receive prior radiation therapy must site measurable disease locate within prior radiation port . Patients warfarin anticoagulation allow participate long fit follow 3 criterion : They therapeutic stable warfarin dose Their INR target range great 3 They monitor regular INR test Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Men use adequate birth control least three month last administration study drug . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . No prior treatment bevacizumab , cetuximab , erlotinib . Prior gemcitabine adjuvant set complete six month previously allow . No investigational agent . No central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , include primary brain tumor , brain metastasis , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 6 month start therapy . No allergic reaction compound similar erlotinib sorafenib . Because increase risk bleeding may occur follow sorafenib administration , patient allow history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . No grade &gt; 2 pulmonary hemorrhage &gt; grade 3 hemorrhage within 28 day begin therapy . No recent invasive procedure define follow : Major surgical procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 1 therapy No Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease , define : Uncontrolled hypertension Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior registration new onset angina within 3 month ( control stable angina acceptable ) New York heart association grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , unstable angina pectoris Grade II great peripheral vascular disease No serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . No active infection require parental antibiotic . No currently active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix . If patient fulldose anticoagulant ( warfarin low molecular weight heparin allow ) , follow criterion meet enrollment : must therapeutic INR , great 3 , stable dose warfarin . No use thrombolytic agent within 1 month study initiation . No gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication prior surgical procedure affect absorption . This may include patient without requirement IV alimentation . No woman pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) nursing . Fertile men woman must agree use adequate contraceptive measure study therapy least 3 month completion antibody therapy . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient , include receive combination antiretroviral therapy , allow study . Any condition impair patient 's ability swallow whole pill Any malabsorption problem</criteria>
