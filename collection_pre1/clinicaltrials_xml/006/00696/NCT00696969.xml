	<brief_summary>The overall objective trial identify safe effective combination , ( coadministration ) short course treatment treatment visceral leishmaniasis could easily deploy control programme reduce risk parasite resistance occur . Safety tolerability combination easily deploy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Evaluate Different Combination Treatment Regimens Visceral Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New , effective , less toxic simplified treatment urgently need replace complement currently available drug treat visceral Leishmaniasis . An interim strategy one slow emergence resistant parasite strain use coadministration currently available drug . In India , first line treatment amphotericin B administer intravenous infusion , alternate day 4 week period . A liposomal formulation amphotericin B , AmBisome , also available , substantially less nephrotoxic amphotericin B , expensive . It acknowledge AmBisome effective therapy visceral leishmaniasis , 's high cost hamper implementation . Use part combination treatment , potentially single , low dose , could reduce treatment cost considerably thereby increase access patient . Two new treatment recently license India treatment patient VL , - Paromomycin administer intramuscular injection , daily 21 day - Miltefosine administer oral tablet , daily 28 day . These drug use monotherapy high risk emergence resistant parasite . With price reduction AmBisome , preferential pricing Miltefosine concern emergence resistant parasite due monotherapy , time move rapidly toward obtain definitive data make recommendation combination therapy soon possible , valuable drug become useless . The present protocol definitive Phase-III trial aim end trial , strong evidence-based recommendation combination therapy available drug make Authorities Indian sub-continent . This protocol evaluate various combination three drug ; AmBisome , Paromomycin Miltefosine reduce total dosage shorter course , present standard treatment amphotericin B deoxycholate .</detailed_description>
