	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure receptor brain involved inflammation . It test two radioactive chemical use procedure see new chemical , [ ( 11 ) C ] B , good good old one , [ ( 11 ) C ] A , measure brain inflammation . Healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants undergo evaluation , [ ( 11 ) C ] A PET scan , [ ( 11 ) C ] B PET scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , follow : Evaluation Medical history physical examination , blood urine test PET scan - [ ( 11 ) C ] A scan . A catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein injection [ ( 11 ) C ] A isotope . Some patient also catheter place artery wrist collect arterial blood sample scan . Subjects lie scanner bed special mask fit head help keep subject head still procedure . Following 8-minute scan calibrate scanner , [ ( 11 ) C ] A injected catheter vein picture take show chemical relate inflammation present . The procedure take 2.5 hour . - [ ( 11 ) C ] B scan . The procedure [ ( 11 ) C ] A , except isotope use [ ( 11 ) C ] B. MRI scan . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The subject lie table slide scanner ( metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : In response brain inflammation , microglia over-express peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) . Although peripheral organ heart kidney express PBR constitutively , brain normally express PBR low number . Increased PBR density brain therefore signifies change normal state active , inflammatory state . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image quantify PBR density vivo use radioligands bind PBR site . One PBR-selective radioligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 , use identify area brain inflammation patient various neurological disease . Unfortunately , [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 several limitation , include low specific signal . A recently develop radioligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , high specificity [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 PBR animal study . No study date compare [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 human subject . In early clinical study use [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , 4 32 healthy human subject complete absence radioligand binding , even peripheral organ constitutively express PBR . One non-binders specific bind PBR28 vitro assay use peripheral lymphocyte . We know subject [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 bind others . We also know one non-binder positive vitro bind negative vivo bind PET image . No study report absent binding [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 . In order well understand phenomenon non-binding , need obtain [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 PET scan subject [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 non-binders . Study Population : This protocol study total 30 healthy human volunteer . Design : Fifteen subject undergo PET image [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 use arterial blood sample fully quantitative image analysis . These subject may dedicate brain PET image whole body PET imaging . Fifteen subject undergo PET image [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 without arterial blood sampling . These subject whole body PET imaging . All subject vitro PBR28 binding assay perform . &lt; TAB &gt; Outcome Measures : Our primary outcome measure distribution volume time stability radioligand . We also wish determine subject absent [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 binding also absent [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 binding . The presence absence [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) -PK 11195 binding evaluate brain peripheral organ . Lastly , measure vitro bind PBR28 perform bind assay use peripheral blood cell .</detailed_description>
