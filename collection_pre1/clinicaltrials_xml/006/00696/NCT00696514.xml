	<brief_summary>It hypothesize vitamin B12 folic acid supplementation reduces number incident fracture . The propose study , randomize placebo-controlled intervention trial , compare daily supplementation folic acid ( 400 mcg ) vitamin B12 ( 500 mcg ) placebo period two year longer 3000 men woman age 70 year old , initial basal plasma total homocysteine ( tHcy ) level &gt; = 15 micromol/L . Fracture incidence time fracture assess use efficacy measure . Metabolic study sub sample population include aim contribute understand biological mechanism underlie association find marker B-vitamin status bone quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin B12 Folic Acid Supplementation Preventing Fractures Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : There grow evidence elevate homocysteine level risk factor fracture incidence . The common cause homocysteine elevation poor vitamin B12 folate status . It hypothesize supplementation 500 µg vitamin B12 400 µg folic acid reduce fracture incidence elderly people Main objective : determine efficacy oral supplementation vitamin B12 folic acid prevention fracture Study design : The trial randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial , two arm parallel ( placebo versus supplement ) . The intervention comprise period two year , target 3000 elderly subject elevate homocysteine level . The study perform institution residence old person around Wageningen , Rotterdam Amsterdam . Study population : 3000 elderly subject ( 70 year old ) elevate homocysteine level Intervention ( applicable ) : One group receive daily tablet 500 µg vitamin B12 400 ug folic acid group receive daily placebo tablet . In tablet 15 µg ( 600 IU ) vitamin D include well . Main study parameters/endpoints : Fracture incidence primary outcome measure Time fracture calculate . It expect intervention group 34 % less fracture occur placebo group . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : First , participant need recruit . This do via information letter . Those interested complete small questionnaire receive information brochure . Upon continued interest intervention study , participant invite blood sampling . This blood sample take place ( nearby ) location participant live . Immediately blood sample run-in period start . Blood check homocysteine level . Only participant elevate level homocysteine include study . Two four week run-in period intervention study implement . At start intervention study several measurement perform several questionnaire complete together participant home . During whole study participant need take daily one tablet complete calender monitor fracture incidence . At end study , blood sampling perform several measurement questionnaire repeat home .</detailed_description>
