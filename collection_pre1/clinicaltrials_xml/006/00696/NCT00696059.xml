	<brief_title>Humira Rheumatoid Arthritis - Do Bone Erosions Heal ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist ( anti-TNF ) therapy rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient find radiographic erosion score decrease patient . This suggest erosive damage may `` heal '' RA patient treat anti-TNF . However , clarify whether reduced score cause technical issue observer variation image acquisition difference . Furthermore , radiography erosion 2D representation 3D pathology therefore ideal visualize healing , present . Verification erosion heal anti-TNF therapy adalimumab ( Humira ) optimal image method , would markedly influence perception effect potential adalimumab ( Humira ) modify structural joint damage RA . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , allow high-resolution 3D visualization bone damage well inflammatory activity bone ( bone marrow edema/osteitis ) , sensitive visualization bone erosion radiography . Computed Tomography ( CT ) 3D radiographic imaging technique , suit assessment inflammation , consider reference method assessment bone damage , due direct 3D visualization calcify tissue . Internationally recommended MRI score system well method estimation erosion volume develop , participation research group . Ultrasonography ( US ) , even though less validated , sensitive radiography comparable MRI detect bone erosion RA joint . Additionally , US provide visualisation soft tissue change synovitis , use gray-scale Doppler US . Repeated MRI , CT , US radiographic examination RA joint mild moderate radiographic damage adalimumab ( Humira ) therapy allow detail assessment extent bone repair/healing adalimumab ( Humira ) therapy .</detailed_description>
