	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Azilsartan Medoxomil Compared Valsartan Olmesartan Participants With Essential Hypertension .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control : one-third patient successfully maintain control . A major component blood pressure regulation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . This system hormone-mediated feedback interaction result relaxation constriction blood vessel response various stimulus . Angiotensin II , polypeptide hormone , form angiotensin I reaction catalyze angiotensin-converting enzyme part renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Angiotensin II principal pressor agent renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system multiple effect cardiovascular system electrolyte homeostasis . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist currently test treatment essential hypertension . Study participation anticipate 10 week . Multiple procedure occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination , electrocardiograms ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . Outside study center , participant require wear ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device 24 hour interval .</detailed_description>
