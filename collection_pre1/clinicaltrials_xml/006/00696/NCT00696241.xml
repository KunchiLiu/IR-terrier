	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one-third patient continue maintain control successfully . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker study conduct evaluate efficacy safety oral azilsartan medoxomil compare placebo olmesartan subject essential hypertension . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate 11 week . Multiple procedure occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , vital sign include sit blood pressure pulse , body height weight , physical examination electrocardiograms . Outside study center , participant require wear ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device 24 hour interval .</detailed_description>
