	<detailed_description>Background : Recently , new category hypoglycemic therapy emerge , aim modulate incretin system diabetic patient . Compared drug induce insulin secretion , agent cause hypoglycemia . However , differential effect incretin modulators classical insulin inducer hypettension , arterial stiffness , inflammation oxidative stress parameter yet investigate . Incretins The increase plasma insulin level follow oral administration glucose usually exceeds level observe intravenous glucose administration . The phenomenon define incretin effect attribute intestinal hormone release oral glucose administration . The two important incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) . Incretin effect reduce type-2 diabetic patient . After oral glucose administration , GIP GLP-1 secrete rapidly inactivate enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) . Accordingly , half-life active GLP-1 le 2 min ( 2 ) . Both GIP GLP-1 stimulate insulin secretion glucose-dependent manner . Moreover , GLP-1 also show increase islet cell neogenesis differentiation , well reduce apoptosis β-cells rodent . ( 3-5 ) . Incretins also affect glucagon secretion . GIP stimulate glucagon production ( 6 ) , whereas GLP-1 inhibits synthesis latter ( 7 ) . Differential effect two peptide glucagon secretion may prove responsible normalization blood glucose intravenous injection GLP-1 administration GIP derivatives [ 7 , 8 ] . Therefore , GLP-1 incretin apply treatment diabetes . In addition direct insulin/glucagons activity , GLP-1 extra-pancreatic effect : - It inhibit gastric empty small bowel motility , effect dependent nitric oxide ( NO ) ( 8 ) . - It induce satiety central nervous system mechanism ( 9 ) . - There data suggest GLP-1 infusion improve LV function . - rGLP-1 infusion significantly attenuate development hypertension Dahl Salt sensitive rat [ 11 ] . In patient type 2 DM , exenatide treatment 2 year also result improvement blood pressure [ 12 ] - GLP-1 exerts direct beneficial effect endothelium-dependent vasodilatation healthy non-diabetic non-smoking normotensive subject [ 13 ] . - In type 2 diabetic subject coronary heart disease , GLP-1 infusion significantly increase relative change brachial artery diameter ( i.e . improve endothelial dysfunction ) [ 14 ] . Since main limitation GLP-1 pharmacokinetic point view rapid inactivation DPP- 4 , two strategy develop . One strategy development GLP-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1 mimetics ) resistant DPP-4 , exenatide ( Byetta ) . The approach prevent inactivation GLP-1 inhibit DPP-4 enzyme activity . DPP-4 inhibitor Mice genetic deletion DPP-4 increase glucose tolerance follow oral glucose administration association augment insulin secretion . [ 15 ] DPP-4 inhibitor animal study show augments active GLP-1 concentration , increase insulin secretion improve glucose tolerance . [ 16 , 17 ] Previous rodent study find GLP-1 analogue may increase beta cell mass stimulate islet neogenesis differentiation inhibit apoptosis. [ 3 ] . Similar effect produce DPP-4 inhibition [ 18 , 19 ] . Sitagliptin Sitagliptin one two study DPP-4 inhibitor ( one vildagliptin ) . It competitive reversible inhibitor enzyme . [ 20 ] It orally active drug absorb rapidly efficiently . Hepatic insufficiency seem alter pharmacokinetics drug , however , renal insufficiency increase circulate level sitagliptin . [ 21 ] Sitagliptin prove well tolerated safe drug , monotherapy combination therapy metformin thiazolidiediones . Thus far , drug interaction observe DPP-4 inhibitor . However , recently post-marketing report anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash , include Stevens-Johnson syndrome , emerge sitagliptin treated patient . [ 22 ] The reported number hypoglycemic event low , expect glucose- induce GLP-1 secretion/effect . Sitagliptin show reduce HBA1C 0.8 % -1.1 % , decrease fast plasma glucose increase beta cell function index type 2 diabetes patient , single therapy combination metformin thizolidinediones , compare placebo [ 23-27 ] . Sitagliptin glipizide similar effect plasma glucose administer combination metformin therapy . [ 28 ] Arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction Augmentation arterial blood pressure , reflect pulsatile component blood pressure thus arterial stiffness , well-known risk factor cardiovascular disease outcome . [ 29-33 ] Augmentation index ( AIx ) measurement , non-invasive way appreciate rate arterial stiffness , show predict coronary artery disease ( CAD ) whole population well patient type 2 diabetes [ 32 , 34 , 35 ] . Differential effect drug arterial stiffness may , part , responsible diversity impact various antihypertensive drug/treatments CAD . [ 33 ] The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation ( CAFE ) study , sub-study Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial ( ASCOT ) , examine impact two different blood pressure lower regimen , atenolol-thiazide base versus amlodipine-perindopril base therapy , derived central aortic pressure value hemodynamics 2199 patient . [ 33 ] Central pulse pressure independent risk factor composite outcome total cardiovascular events/procedures development renal impairment . Similarly , statin drug show exert additional beneficiary effect AIx , result entirely independent primary , cholesterol lowering , effect. [ 36 ] . Regarding type 2 diabetes , previously demonstrate increase adiponectin level , secondary treatment insulin sensitizer pioglitazone metformin , may decrease arterial stiffness . [ 37 ] . By analogy , incretins , addition stimulatory effect insulin secretion , might positive impact decrease arterial stiffness diabetic patient . Nystrom et al . demonstrate GLP-1 improves endothelial dysfunction small group type 2 diabetes subject coronary heart disease [ 14 ] . However , actual effect DPP-4 arterial stiffness yet investigate . According American diabetes association , treatment biguanides start case diagnosis type 2 diabetes .If target glycemia level achieve , another medication add . In respect , one overemphasize importance discover positive additional effect , , administer antidiabetic drug blood pressure , arterial stiffness , oxidative stress and/or inflammation marker . The purpose propose clinical trial compare effect two different type insulin inducer , sulfonyl urea incretin , blood pressure , monitor within 24h period , well arterial stiffness parameter . In addition , assessment blood marker oxidative stress , represent 8-STAT-Isoprostane , oxidize LDL [ H202 ? carbonil group ? ] , well marker inflammation , represent TGF-ß , Il-1 , Il-6 , Il-4 , Il-10 highly sensitive CRP perform . Methods The study design prospective , randomize , single blind , cross-over trial . It include 60 diabetic patient , age 18 year old , treat metformin . Only patient HbA1C level within range 7 % - 11 % enrol study . All patient submit write informed consent participate experiment prior inclusion study . The exclusion criterion follow : - CCT &lt; 30 - A history treatment incretins sulfonylurea last 3 month - Treatment nitrate - Uncontrolled heart failure - Uncontrolled hypertension and/or change hypertensive medication within one month prior start study - No proven regular treatment aspirin statin within one month prior start study - Any malignancy life expectancy le 1 year - pregnancy Patients include study randomly assign one two experimental group : Group A : receive sitagliptin , 100 mg single dose daily , Group B : glibenclamide , 5 mg single dose daily . The latter dosage might increase , need , 5 mg twice day . After 3 month , one-week wash-out period antidiabetic drug ( exclude metformin ) administer , imposed patient .Following 1 week , cross-over protocol apply : group A , earlier treat sitagliptin , receive glibenclamid , vice versa , group B start sitagliptin treatment . The primary end result aim obtained study detection arterial stiffness , define change augmentation index measure mean non-invasive technique use commercially available SphygmoCor System , result 24 hour blood pressure monitoring . The secondary end result would oxidative stress parameter , evaluate oxidized LDL Isoprostanes , marker inflammatory status , include measurement pro-inflammatory interleukin performance highly sensitive CRP test . All patient enrol study invite Research &amp; Development Unit Assaf-Harofeh three visit : prior start experiment , follow 3 month follow 6 month . Their weight abdominal circumference record ; arterial stiffness measure ; , connect blood pressure halter , record blood pressure 24h . At visit , 10ml periohera blood drawn evaluation HBA1C , complete blood count , serum electrolyte , albumin , blood lipid , fast glucose 8F-STAT-Isoprostanes , oxidize LDL , nitric oxide , inflammatory interleukin highly sensitive CRP ( hsCRP ) . Any side effect drug complaint event hypoglycemia also record .</detailed_description>
