	<brief_summary>The study register ClinicalTrials part study overall study title 'Dynamic stability ACL-injured knee ' . The aim overall study prospectively follow cohort newly injure patient total rupture anterior cruciate ligament knee , order document result different rehabilitation regime injury . The title part study 'Neuromuscular change ACL-deficient individual intensive perturbation training program . A case-control study . ' The aim part study : 1 . To describe muscle activation pattern , joint angle force gait one-legged hop newly injure ACL-deficient individual execution intensive training program consist either perturbation training conventional balance- stability training 2 . To describe eventual change two group may indicate superiority either one methods The study include 25 subject group . The intervention consist two different rehabilitation protocol neuromuscular training . Subjects test biomechanical laboratory intervention , use 3D camera system , force plate electromyographic measurement ( EMG ) . Main outcomes eventual difference muscle activation pattern , joint angle force select phase walk one-legged hopping . Secondary outcomes interest self-assessment knee function , isokinetic strength functional one-legged hop test . Status : Inclusion main study start January 2007 . Data collection case-control part study take place 2008-2009 . The part study study finish 2010 , result include PhD dissertation . The PhD student responsible , Ingrid Eitzen , enrol Doctoral program Faculty Medicine , University Oslo . She employ Orthopaedic Centre , Ullevaal University Hospital part The Norwegian Research Center Active Rehabilitation ( NAR ) . The project include NAR research program . In addition , overall study organize formalized collaboration University Delaware , US , also follow cohort 150 subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study 'Dynamic stability ACL-injured knee ' carry part formalize research collaboration University Delaware , US , NAR , Orthopaedic Centre , Ullevaal University Hospital , Norway . The project fund National Institutes Health . 150 patient , men woman , age 13-55 year , three year-period enrol study . Follow-up time 2 year . A part-study case-control design include 50 patient . In Norway , approximately 4000 person rupture anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) per year . The majority individual relatively young people , engage various physical activity . Most ACL-ruptures occur within pivot sport like soccer , team handball , floorball , basketball volleyball , also within racket sport , ice-hockey , dance/gymnastics alpine ski . A ruptured ACL serious injury individual , often experience exclusion form work , leisure activity sport potentially long period time . A considerable number patient able return pre-injury activity level , many also experience long time consequence , serious development knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The function injure knee varies considerably among patient torn ACL . Some able stabilize knee even demand activity sport , others experience frequent episode give way , also follow daily activity . Currently , little consensus regard optimal rehabilitation program follow ACL injury and/or criterion ACL-reconstruction . But , whether manage operatively non-operatively , full return pre-injury activity ACL rupture always dependent development dynamic knee stability . In past 10-15 year , test battery consist standardise validated test screen classification newly injure ACL-patients develop . The test battery include four different functional one-legged hop test , two questionnaire knee function self-evaluation knee status form global rating . The questionnaire include The Knee Outcome Survey - Activities Daily Living ( KOS-ADL ) , The International Knee Documentation Subjective Knee Form ( IKDC 2000 ) . In addition , measure laxity tibia femur KT1000 , register eventual number episode give way perform isokinetic strength measurement quadriceps hamstring muscle Biodex6000 system . Based test , newly diagnose patient ACL-rupture may classify accord whether good poor dynamic stability . Those 80 % performance injure leg compare non-injured leg hop test , score 80 KOS-ADL , rate score least 60 global rating experience maximum one episode give way , categorize potential copers . Those score limit and/or experience two episode give way categorize non-copers . In Norway , approximately 50 % ACL-injured individual go reconstructive surgery . The optimal time decide whether surgery best treatment option highly individual , recent research demonstrate functional status knee time eventual surgery important time span since date injury . Reconstructive surgery large degree re-establish mechanical stability knee , proven provide sufficient dynamical stability make patient able return his/hers pre-injury activity level . It present time neither documented reconstructive ACL-surgery reduces risk later development knee OA . Several question remain affect development effective rehabilitation program patient ACL rupture . Validated practice guideline patient ACL injury discriminate surgical non-surgical candidate , lead return pre-injury activity , protect future joint health report . The case-control part study aim specifically investigate effectiveness two different protocol neuromuscular training , before- intervention data collection biomechanical laboratory . Results overall study ( inclusive part study ) allow u extend previous finding provide information need identify treat individual ACL rupture across spectrum compensation strategy . Follow-up project include - Functional one-legged hop test - Instrumental measurement knee laxity ( KT1000 ) - Isokinetic strength test quadriceps hamstring muscle - Biomechanical analysis gait one-legged hop Motion Analysis Laboratory Norwegian University Sport Sciences - Self-assessment knee function form global rating</detailed_description>
