	<brief_summary>The principal research question : Can platelet P2Y12 receptor blockade antithrombotic drug clopidogrel significantly enhance coadministration antibiotic rifampicin ? Clopidogrel antithrombotic drug clinical use reduces risk heart attack coronary stent thrombosis . However patient respond poorly clopidogrel , least partly fail convert effectively active form , consequently high risk arterial thrombosis . Preliminary evidence indicate antibiotic rifampicin enhances effectiveness clopidogrel increase conversion active form liver . We wish study extent rifampicin 's effect clopidogrel see whether might useful clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel antithrombotic drug license treatment prevention arterial thrombosis , people admit hospital heart attack . However , people fail achieve substantial antithrombotic effect drug one important reason liver convert clopidogrel active form effectively . Current evidence suggest people less protected clopidogrel high risk arterial thrombosis respond well clopidogrel . Rifampicin antibiotic increase activity liver enzymes convert clopidogrel active form preliminary evidence indicate increase effectiveness clopidogrel . This raise possibility rifampicin might use clopidogrel increase clinical effectiveness . We wish study interaction . 12 healthy volunteer recruit study give informed consent . Following Screening , study run 28 day . Lab safety ( clinical chemistry , haematology urinalysis ) undertaken day 7 , 22 28 addition screening . During first visit , intravenous cannula insert forearm vein . Subjects perform erythromycin breath test . Subsequently , venous blood obtain via intravenous cannula platelet function study perform plasma sample store baseline metabolite analysis . Subsequently subject administer 600 mg load dose clopidogrel ( Plavix , Sanofi Pharma Bristol−Myers Squibb ) blood sample take 4 hour clopidogrel metabolite analysis platelet function study . Subjects take clopidogrel 75 mg daily 6 day , 4 hour last dose , blood sample take use venepuncture platelet function study plasma sample . After washout period 7 day , subject start rifampicin 300 mg twice daily 14 day ( Rifadin , Aventis Pharma ) . On 8th day take rifampicin , intravenous cannula insert , erythromycin breath test repeat , , regimen clopidogrel administration blood test repeat , time co−administration rifampicin . The data obtain allow follow assessment : ( ) comparison early effect 600 mg clopidogrel load dose late effect clopidogrel 7 day platelet aggregation receptor blockade ; ( ii ) assessment effect rifampicin clopidogrel 's action platelet aggregation receptor blockade follow load dose prolong administration clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
