	<brief_summary>Epigenomics develop colon cancer screen assay base differential methylation specific CpG sit detection early stage disease . A genome-wide methylation analysis oligonucleotide array study use DNA various stage colon cancer normal tissue complete obtain candidate CpG marker . Based result obtained study , Epigenomics move final stage feasibility specific , highly sensitive real-time marker assay able detect colon cancer DNA blood plasma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From public health well health economics perspective , poor adoption current screening option limit effectiveness CRC screen initiative ; state Sidney Winawer , MD , `` best test one get do . '' Current CRC screening guideline include FOBT , sigmoidoscopy ( alone FOBT ) , colonoscopy . Non-invasive screening conduct use FOBT , inexpensive , exhibit low compliance rate ( around 16 % US ) due use restriction , perceive inconvenience lack consumer acceptance . The gold standard procedure CRC detection colonoscopy ; exhibit excellent performance characteristic , limited utility first line screen due high cost , healthcare delivery resource limitation , inadequate patient acceptance . It believe noninvasive , first-line screen assay capable detecting individual colorectal disease , confirm colonoscopy , would great utility population screen . Epigenomics identify methylated gene region specific colorectal cancer pre-malignant tissue . Aberrantly methylated gene represent attractive candidate marker cancer screening , cancer-specific methylation change occur early tumorigenesis , appear stable , yield positive amplifiable signal , assay high analytical sensitivity . Since methylation occur early distinct genomic area , possible achieve high clinical sensitivity small number methylated DNA marker . Studies show aberrantly methylated DNA marker detect tissue body fluid highly correlate colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
