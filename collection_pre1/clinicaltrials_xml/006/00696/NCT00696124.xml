	<brief_title>Safety Study Gene Therapy Treating Lower Leg Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist four ( 4 ) cohort total 3 subject enrol cohort VM202.For dose cohort , VM202 administer local intramuscular injection 2 divided dos 2-week interval injection . Preliminary efficacy ( hemodynamic assessment ) , safety tolerability evaluate Baseline ( screen ) designate time point throughout study . After subject first dose cohort complete 30-day ( + 2 day ) follow-up visit follow first dose study drug , interim safety evaluation perform submission safety data Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) . If DSMC recommend continue study , second dose cohort treat . This process repeat second third dose cohort third fourth dose cohort . All four dose cohort follow 5 year time first dose study drug administration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , 20 90 year age Have critical limb ischemia ( Rutherford Class 4 5 ) consider candidate bypass graft surgery percutaneous angioplasty due comorbid condition , failure previous surgical interventional procedure caliber graft artery . Critical Limb ischemia define 1 . Stable symptom standard therapy include antiplatelet agent , vascular rheologic agent , cilostazol , anticoagulant pain medication 30 day . 2 . Pain rest and/or ischemic ulcer minimum 4 week . Have diagnostic angiography affect limb last 12 month demonstrate significant occlusion one follow artery : iliac , superficial femoral , popliteal , one infrapopliteal artery . Have rest ankle systolic pressure ( either dorsalis pedis posterior tibial artery ) less equal 60mmHg rest toe systolic pressure less equal 40 mmHg affect limb . Be willing maintain current drug therapy peripheral arterial disease throughout course study include antiplatelet statin ( CoA Reductase ) inhibitor treatment Be capable understand comply protocol signing informed consent document prior subject study related procedure Women surgically sterile least 1 year postmenopausal practice adequate contraception least 12 week prior enter study . If subject childbearing potential , must negative serum pregnancy test result study . If subject subject 's partner ( ) child bear potential , subject subject 's partner ( ) must agree use `` double barrier '' method birth control participate study . Subjects undergone revascularization procedure sympathectomy within 12 week prior study entry remain patent . A failed revascularization procedure previous 4 week acceptable . Subjects grade 3 ( hemorrhage , exudate ) grade 4 ( papilledema ) retinopathy . Subjects currently receive immunosuppressive medication , chemotherapy , radiation therapy . Subject aortoiliac occlusion ( great 75 % ) . Subjects require amputation within 4 week randomization . Subjects comorbid condition likely interfere assessment safety efficacy estimate life expectancy le 6 month Subjects history drug ( define illicit drug use ) history alcohol abuse ( define regular daily consumption 4 alcoholic drink per day ) within past 3 month . Subjects current history new screen find malignant neoplasm except basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin ( excised evidence recurrence ) . Subjects evidence active infection ( e.g . cellulitis , osteomyelitis ) deep ulceration expose bone tendon extremity plan treatment . Subjects clinically significant abnormality routine hematology , urinalysis , chemistry , liver function laboratory test , include HIV , Hepatitis B ( HepBSAg ) , Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test ( VDRL ) , prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) , chorioembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , sign malignant neoplasm radiological imaging test , include chest radiograph Screening Day 1 . Specific laboratory exclusion criterion include follow : 1 . Hemoglobin le 9.0 G/dl 2 . WBC count less 3,000 3 . Platelet count less 75,000 4 . Fasting glucose great 250 mg/dl 5 . AST and/or ALT great 3X upper limit normal Subjects condition opinion investigator might put subject risk interfere his/her participation . Subjects unable unwilling comply protocol cooperate fully investigator site personnel . Subjects receive investigational drug within 30 day prior study drug administration receive drug timeframe study . Subjects uncontrolled hypertension define systolic blood pressure great 200 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great 115 mmHg Baseline evaluation . Subjects advance liver disease include decompensated cirrhosis , jaundice , ascites bleed varix .</criteria>
