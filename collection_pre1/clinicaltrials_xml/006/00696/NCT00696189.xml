	<brief_summary>The concept ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) , define difference mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) intraocular pressure ( IOP . ) It hypothesize unopposed decrease MAP , increase IOP combination two may result hypo perfusion eye cause ocular infarction level retina optic nerve , lead vary degree visual loss frequently bilateral irreversible . Both prone position downward head tilting ( Trendelenburg position ) associate increase IOP compare supine horizontal position ( 2,4,5,6 ) , know whether Trendelenburg position surgery anesthesia associate POVL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our preliminary Phase I study use awake volunteer confirm increase IOP associate prone position attenuate , although eliminate , 15 cm head table elevation . In addition find evidence retinal vascular change consistent venous congestion one hour period prone position five awake volunteer use digital retinal imaging . It known general anesthesia decrease IOP . A critical element , however , definitively studied effect individual anesthetic , specifically nitrous oxide , IOP . It know nitrous oxide increase IOP inert gas inject vitreous treatment retinal detachment phenomenon last six week , result permanent vision loss use . It also show nitrous oxide increase intracranial pressure ( ICP,9 ) although effect may attenuate narcotic additional intravenous anesthetic agent . It also increase cerebral metabolic rate , potentially aggravate compromise blood flow . Several study show significant association elevate IOP ICP . Therefore , critical attempt isolate effect nitrous oxide IOP . Because nitrous oxide use adjunct anesthetic , frequently use inhalation anesthetic delineate effect variable help clinician decide whether advantage use outweigh risk . Because general anesthesia decrease IOP significant variation subject study plan use within subject design . Patients undergo open gynecological procedure hysterectomies patient undergo orthopedic surgery ideal candidate propose study follow reason . The majority patient undergo general anesthesia University Hospital operating room require frequent table position change might affect result . Therefore , choose study patient remain one position majority operation . The hysterectomy patient offer unique benefit It would also advantageous study patient position know increase IOP order well detect difference anesthetic regimen isolate effect specific agent . In addition , patient undergo orthopedic surgery hand ankle procedure commonly fix supine position predominance operation . University Hospital conduct considerably great number orthopedic case gynecological case daily allow great ease patient enrollment . Measuring IOP supine Trendelenburg position offer significant technical logistical advantage compare prone position therefore take measurement position desirable .</detailed_description>
