	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential [ 18F ] -ML-10 serve non-invasive imaging tool early detection apoptosis brain metastasis response radiation therapy , patient subject stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . Such early detection may improve clinical management patient brain metastasis , may help early identification non-responders , subsequently potentially lead optimization radiation technique need whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) , addition brain penetrate chemotherapy early decision referral patient non-responsive lesion surgery systemic chemotherapy . The experimental design present study aim evaluate potential non-invasive PET examination [ 18F ] -ML-10 , provide clinician assessment response early course treatment , via non-invasive molecular image radiation-induced apoptosis . This information tumor responsiveness currently available several week month completion radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F ML-10 Early Detection Response Brain Metastases SRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early assessment efficacy anti-cancer therapy highly desirable unmet need clinical oncology . Currently , treatment efficacy mostly measure follow tumor size anatomical imaging ( CT scan MRI ) . However , change tumor size may observe several week several month completion treatment . Meanwhile , case response , patient unnecessarily expose treatment 's side effect , precious time may lose initiation alternative , potentially beneficial line therapy . Therefore , urgent serious need well tool monitor tumor response anti-cancer treatment . To address need , [ 18F ] -ML-10 , novel small molecular-weight probe ( MW 205 ) develop clinical detection apoptosis vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) . [ 18F ] -ML-10 member ApoSense family compound , novel class molecular probe molecular image cell death . The first clinical indication [ 18F ] -ML-10 develop image apoptosis clinical oncology monitor tumor response radiation therapy . Previous preclinical clinical study substantiate safety [ 18F ] -ML-10 , high stability vivo , favorable biodistribution profile , efficacy clinical detection cell death . In preclinical study , selective retention [ 18F ] -ML-10 focus neurovascular cell death cerebral ischemia demonstrate respective animal model . [ 18F ] -ML-10 examine two clinical trial Uppsala Imanet , Sweden , find safe administration healthy subject elderly subject acute ischemic cerebral stroke . In clinical trial , [ 18F ] -ML-10 also find efficacious clinical imaging apoptosis , either physiological apoptosis observe testis young healthy male , pathological cell death , observed brain patient acute ischemic cerebral stroke .</detailed_description>
