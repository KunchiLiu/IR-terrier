	<brief_title>Neurobiology Treatment Reading Disability NF-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common concern parent child neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF-1 ) learn disability ( LD ) . Approximately one half child NF-1 LD—the debilitate common reading disability . The purpose study determine child NF-1 reading disability respond way—both behaviorally neurobiologically—to specialize treatment program know improve decode deficit child idiopathic reading disability . The trial also determine intervention best particular learner profile . The overall purpose research gain deeper understand characteristic treatment read disability NF-1 . In trial , researcher compare child NF-1 show weaknesses read child read disability know cause ( idiopathic ) use two different intervention behavioral neurobiological measure . Both intervention focus teach sound-symbol relationship , vary term relative emphasis verbal versus visual method teach . Scientists hope finding trial advance knowledge best therapy LD child NF-1 . And , refine child NF-1 reading disability similar ( different ) child idiopathic reading disability , researcher may able learn read intervention address area decode also benefit child NF-1 . Also , understand similarity and/or difference neuropsychological neurobiological profile child NF-1 reading disability , without , scientist able refine cognitive phenotype neurobiological characteristic NF-1 , understanding central nervous system abnormalities NF-1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This study open individual , age 8 17 year , meet eligibility criterion regardless race , gender , socioeconomic status . The Reading Disabilities group ( include NF1 ) define score equal le 25th percentile measure basic word reading skill . The Control group ( include NF1 ) define score equal 40th percentile average Letter Word Identification Word Attack subtests WJIII . Any child , regardless group he/she recruit , exclude he/she meet follow criterion ( determine phone screening , medical review , test ) : foster care ; previous diagnosis mental retardation ; know uncorrectable visual impairment ; history know neurological disorder ( e.g. , epilepsy , spina bifida , cerebral palsy , traumatic brain injury ) ; document hearing impairment great 25 dB loss either ear ; medical contraindication MRI procedure , participate MRI ( include exposure metal pregnancy ) ; individual know IQ 70 ; history presence pervasive developmental disorder ; DICAIV parent indicate presence severe psychiatric diagnosis pervasive developmental disorder .</criteria>
