	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether injected medication increase amount fat release fat cell . We compare prednisolone ( synthetic cortisone ) combine isoproterenol ( drug give asthma ) versus use isoproterenol alone . We also test injection isoproterenol prednisolone shrink size lipoma , benign fatty tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lipomas benign , non-cancerous fatty tumor occur skin make bump easily felt often see . The current treatment lipoma surgery . Isoproterenol , medication use treatment asthma approve injection skin , know cause fat cell give fat . The fat cell become resistant isoproterenol repeat use . Prednisolone , synthetic cortisone medication use treat immune problem like allergy approve injection skin , keep fat cell become resistant isoproterenol . It known , fat cell lipomas act like fat cell combination isoproterenol prednisolone injection would shrink lipoma without surgery . This study design test possibility . Subjects screen visit , 2 microdialysis visit week apart , 20 treatment visit 5 day per week 4 week , 12 follow-up visit year treatment visit . During screen , subject history , physical exam , blood testing , electrocardiogram pregnancy test female reproductive capacity . The first microdialysis visit consist place two microdialysis catheter skin area numb . One microdialysis catheter lipoma skin 2 inch away . The microdialysis catheter connect pump , isoproterenol infuse amount fat breakdown measure . One week later prednisolone inject lipoma skin 2 inch away . The microdialysis visit repeat 24 hour later . Treatment consist inject lipoma 5 day week mixture isoproterenol prednisolone Pennington clinic diabetic would inject insulin . Each week blood pressure , pulse lipoma measure subject ask feel . At end treatment period physical examination , blood test electrocardiogram repeat . The insertion microdialysis probe skin fat tissue could uncomfortable , numb medication inject first prevent problem . At high dos , isoproterenol could lower blood pressure increase pulse rate . This happen dos use , blood pressure pulse monitor throughout study . Prednisolone , high dos , could decrease body 's production cortisone . This happen dos use , cortisone body measured trial . Blood test involve discomfort needle go skin arm , possible bruising rarely fainting infection . Trained technician sterile needle minimize risk .</detailed_description>
