	<brief_summary>Background : Prognosis infective endocarditis poor remain steady last four decade . Several nonrandomized study suggest early surgery could improve prognosis . Methods : The early surgery infective endocarditis study ( ENDOVAL 1 ) multicenter , prospective , randomize study design compare state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy ( advised international society guideline ) early surgery strategy high-risk patient infective endocarditis . Patients infective endocarditis without indication surgery include meet least one following : 1 ) early-onset prosthetic endocarditis ; 2 ) Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis ; 3 ) periannular complication ; 4 ) new-onset conduction abnormality ; 5 ) vegetation longer 10 mm diameter ; 6 ) new-onset severe valvular disfunction . A total 216 patient randomize either two strategy . Stratification do within 3 day admission . In early surgery arm , procedure perform within 48 hour randomization . The event consider death within 30 day . The study extend 1 year . In follow-up substudy , death new episode endocarditis regard event . Conclusion : The early surgery infective endocarditis study ( ENDOVAL 1 ) , first randomize endocarditis , provide crucial information regard putative benefit early surgery state-of-the-art therapeutic approach high-risk patient infective endocarditis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Whereas mortality dramatically reduce area cardiac disease thanks continuous progress treatment , endocarditis remain high-mortality disease steady percentages mortality last 30 year . Several reason may help account frustrating comparison . The change pattern epidemiology endocarditis surely contribute still high mortality . Patients old , prosthetic nosocomial endocarditis currently frequent , Staphylococcus aureus increase causative agent . But clinical investigator field must aware fault generate evidence-based investigation . A paucity comprehensive information exist high-quality evidence lack . In fact , even single randomize study available regard challenge decision endocarditis decide whether surgery undertaken active phase disease . Therefore , guideline treatment endocarditis endorse prestigious scientific society support moderate ( level B ) low level evidence ( level C ) . Not even single recommendation medical versus surgical treatment base high level evidence ( level A ) . Unfortunately , still true `` still much art science care patient endocarditis '' . The way investigator balance tip favour science promote randomized clinical study power enough answer unsettle crucial clinical question . Some encourage take track ; suggest others , however , randomize study compare medical versus surgical treatment endocarditis undertaken . American European guideline state level evidence B C , subtle difference , surgery consider active endocarditis follow situation : heart failure , valve abnormality ( dehiscence , perforation rupture ) , periannular complication , persistent vegetation systemic embolization , increase vegetation size despite appropriate antibiotic , persistent infection , infection microorganism know cured antimicrobial therapy . All indication well-known predictor poor short-term outcome infective endocarditis surgery presume favourably alter prognosis . However , already know result surgery bad patient heart failure persistent infection . Besides , predictor frequently appear several day initial diagnosis . Finally , early surgery active endocarditis show low mortality compare usual medico-surgical approach . Based background , hypothesize wait predictor poor prognosis appear , surgery may come late . If , nonetheless , surgery perform within first 3 day admission patient high-risk profile clinical course worsens , prognosis may improve . To test hypothesis , factor define early high-risk profile identify . With aim , undertook prospective , multicenter study 317 patient left-sided endocarditis demonstrate heart failure , Staphylococcus aureus periannular complication detect within 72 hour admission identify patient poor prognosis . In summary , predictor poor prognosis available within 72 hour admission accurately identify high-risk patient . The initial clinical profile result first transesophageal echocardiogram initial blood culture accurate enough stratify patient high- low-risk . Whether early surgery improve prognosis undertaken former attractive hypothesis never test far . Once able early identify high-risk profile infective endocarditis follow step randomize study state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy patient endocarditis ( medical treatment surgery predictor poor prognosis appear early late disease process ) compare early surgical approach . Of course , surgery medical treatment compare would unethical . What design study compare two different therapeutical strategy high-risk patient , state-of-the art approach , propose international society , early surgery strategy include two consecutive step : 1 ) identification high-risk patient mean predictor available within 72 hour admission ; 2 ) surgery within 48 hour inclusion patient high-risk group . METHODS Study hypothesis Our hypothesis early surgery high-risk patient active infective endocarditis decrease mortality consider treatment choice population . Study objectives Our objective compare 30 day mortality rate high-risk patient active infective endocarditis early surgical approach ( surgery perform within first 48 hour inclusion 5 day initial diagnosis ) state-of-the-art treatment disease ( medical treatment follow surgery predictor poor prognosis appear early late ) . Study population Our initial study population make patient active infective endocarditis initial phase disease ( le 5 day diagnosis ) meet exclusion criterion ( table I ) . Diagnosis infective endocarditis perform accord modify Duke criterion . Patients require urgent surgery ( heart failure , septic shock , fungal endocarditis ) rapidly send surgery . Patients 5 day diagnosis first contact centre exclude since concept early surgery apply . A surgical risk 40 % calculated mean logistic Euroscore system also exclude since preoperative status poor surgical risk prohibits surgical approach . Patients ischemic hemorrhagic stroke also exclude give difficult management perioperative period may introduce bias result . Study design Patients without exclusion criterion divide two group accord risk profile . When patient fulfil high-risk criterion , consider low-risk patient manage state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy , accord guideline accept different international society : medical management multidisciplinary team accomplish . A complete clinical examination do every day . Blood urine analysis , chest X-ray , EKG blood culture take initially , every 7 day . Transthoracic ransesophageal echocardiography perform initially . All previous test , include transesophageal echocardiography , perform always clinical status change . CT scan indicate stroke peripheral embolus clinically suspect . Surgery consider decide individual basis follow present : heart failure , periannular complication , persistent &gt; 10 mm vegetation systemic embolization , persistent infection ( fever positive blood culture 7 day correct antibiotic treatment source fever rule ) . The specific surgical technique decide surgeon accord degree tissular destruction aim remove infected tissue repair damage structure , feasible , implant cardiovascular prosthesis . If patient meet high-risk criterion , randomize state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy aforementioned early surgical strategy . In latter , surgery must perform within 48 hour randomization . Therefore , time first contact hospital surgery longer 5 day ( 3 day transesophageal exam blood culture available 2 day randomization surgery ) . The study flow chart show figure 1 . The event consider statistical analysis death within 30 day admission . The study prolong patient follow 1 year . In long-term analysis death new episode endocarditis consider event . Table II depict study schedule procedure . Table III depict long-term substudy schedule procedures The protocol approve local ethical committee follow institution : 1 ) Universitary Clinic Hospital , Valladolid , Spain ; 2 ) Universitary Clinic Hospital San Carlos , Madrid , Spain ; 3 ) Universitary Clinic Hospital Valle Hebrón , Barcelona , Spain . It currently evaluate cardiologist cardiac surgeon : 1 ) Universitary Clinic Hospital Gregorio Marañón , Madrid , Spain ; 2 ) Clínic Hospital , Barcelona , Spain ; 3 ) German Trias Pujol Hospital , Badalona , Barcelona , Spain . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Determination sample size The study power address primary hypothesis decision operate urgent basis patient high-risk endocarditis decrease in-hospital mortality compare patient manage state-to-art strategy . Thus , sample size calculate base assumption 30 % mortality state-to-art group ( 19 ) versus 13 % early surgery group ( 17 % relative reduction ) . A sample size 206 patient produce study power 80 % 2-sided α level .05 . As result , assume 5 % loss study period , sample size 216 enrol patient need 108 group . Randomization Once patient comply protocol requirement sign informed consent , include study randomize one two strategy . Randomization perform block four six patient automate assignment system . Blocks re-randomized avoid know block size . All calculation perform C4-Study design pack ( Glaxo Wellcome V1.1 ) The independence guarantee person make process contact telephone take clinical decision patient . Safety issue An intermediate analysis do control quality information collect contrast hypothesis study . The study stop rate adverse event high expect observed . Statistical analysis Once information collect checked , statistical analysis begin . Statistical analysis data follow intention-to-treat principle , , patient analyze accord treatment arm randomize , regardless adherence assign treatment . Continuous variable compare t-Student test U Mann-Whitney test non-normally distribute variable categorical variable compare Chi-Square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . The distribution time event variable estimate Kaplan-Meier method , treatment effect compare log-rank test . The Cox regression method use estimate hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval . All test two-sided p value less 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . Statistical analysis perform SPSS software V 14.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA )</detailed_description>
