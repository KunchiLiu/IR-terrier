	<brief_summary>When child undergoes heart surgery , heart lung machine use keep blood flow child 's heart stop . After surgery , significant amount child 's blood leave machine . In case small child , relative amount blood potentially lose child way large . In old child , undergone less complicated surgery , blood return child . Giving child back blood make less likely child need transfusion donate blood . However , young child , child undergo complicate surgery , blood thrown away . This worry return blood may cause bleeding , excessive bleed one feared complication heart surgery . This project explore method whereby red blood cell leave heart lung machine return child without increase risk bleeding . It also carefully examine exact cause higher bleed risk child get blood back future , child blood return end surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Washing Red Blood Cells Post Heart Surgery Blood Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis study study population , compare re-infusion residual CPB blood , re-infusion red cell component residual CPB blood , cause less defect clotting , lead decrease hemorrhage less post-operative blood loss . The secondary objective project document effect clot system pump blood re-infusion mean laboratory test . This work do crucial importance future optimization use pump blood . We expect detect quantify significant accuracy increase bleed risk hemostatic profiling . This information invaluable planning safe introduction residual CPB blood re-infusion small child increase risk postoperative blood loss . Furthermore , determine whether potentially beneficial effect clot system return component residual CPB blood , increase function platelet , increase clotting factor , realize . This information determine utility pursue mean non red cell component residual CPB blood safely re-infused . Induction anesthesia , arterial venous vascular catheter placement , heparin administration , cardiopulmonary bypass machine setup priming , conduct CPB , ultrafiltration blood CPB , post-CPB protamine administration post-CPB blood ultrafiltration standardize per current clinical practice . Residual CPB blood process re-infused accord group allocation . Intravascular volume form crystalloid , blood product administer study residual blood product infusion require accord protocol . Subjects blood sample hemoglobin concentration immediately induction anesthesia 24 hour follow surgery . Arterial blood sample patient hemostatic profile , outline adjacent text box , separation CPB prior initiation residual CPB blood product re-infusion . A second sample obtain re-infusion residual CPB blood product complete . In addition , hemostatic profile run directly sample residual CPB blood product . Subject demographic data , surgical diagnosis procedure , CPB data , medication , blood product intravenous fluid administration , total volume study fluid administer , blood lose surgery sponge suction 24 hour mediastinal drainage record subject . Any case incomplete re-infusion study blood product note reason occurrence .</detailed_description>
