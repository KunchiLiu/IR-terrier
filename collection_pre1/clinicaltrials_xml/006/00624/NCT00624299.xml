	<brief_summary>The surgery correct leg &amp; foot deformity child lengthy , &amp; sometimes , difficult procedure . Metal frames attach leg / foot period time frame manipulate obtain corrected position . During period muscle &amp; skin become tight cause pain &amp; may pull joint position . When happen sometimes necessary stop treatment best position obtain . This mean child left inadequate result surgery require future . If tension could remove whilst treatment underway would reduce pain , possibility joint damage &amp; potentially allow satisfactory obtain without need surgery . Botulinum toxin Botox , commonly call , potential temporarily reduce tension muscle without cause permanent damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excessive soft tissue tension ( i.e.. tight muscle associate tissue ) limit factor lengthen correction limb length deficiency . Bone lengthen achieve surgically break bone use extend device , commonly place outside limb , bone end distract . One millimetre day commonly amount distraction , however soft tissue increase length slow pace bone lead soft tissue tension . Excessive soft tissue tension lead : - Soft tissue contracture temporary permanent short muscle tendon - Joint subluxation instability joint slip line loose - Pain - Loss function inability move joint properly difficulty walk This put joint vulnerable situation increase possibility subluxation . A similar problem arise tibial lengthening , ankle take equinus position ( foot pointing ) . Both deformity reduce functional ability child risk joint become permanently damage . Increasing pain level accompany deformity lead great reluctance comply treatment rehabilitation . The lack joint mobility detrimental effect limb become weak stiff . These event become vicious cycle difficult resolve without intervention . When soft tissue tension become problem , i.e . pain level increase difficult control , joint threat instability , first course action slow stop lengthening day allow soft tissue tension decrease . The drawback potential bone end start fuse prevent lengthen process resume . To start process mean child general anaesthetic enable bone osteotomised ( break ) . Online Form 6 Some group child undergo lengthen susceptible soft tissue tension others therefore prophylactic surgical measure employ . In anticipation soft tissue tension muscle know create problem commonly select surgical release . This show effective method reduce effect tension without problem . Releases do time surgery may heal lengthen complete may need repeat . Releases cause trauma muscle tendon heals scar tissue , structure know less pliable specialised muscle tendon tissue . Regaining long term function compromise . Temporarily reduce soft tissue tension lengthen phase treatment long term consequence would ideal situation . Botulinum toxin ability . Paley ( 2004 ) use Botulinum toxin adjunct place soft tissue release femoral lengthening note seem reduce muscle spasm pain patient . Unfortunately support form evaluative research .</detailed_description>
