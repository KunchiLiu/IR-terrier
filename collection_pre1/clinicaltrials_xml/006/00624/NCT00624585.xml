	<brief_title>Study Oral Dasatinib Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Excess Marrow Blasts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Core Period : The first 16 week initial dose dasatinib call Study Core Period . Patients eligible chose participate study expect take 100 mg dasatinib daily 8 week . If study doctor believe achieve partial response 8 week treatment , dose may increase 150 mg per day . The study doctor may lower dosage dasatinib 100 mg treatment strong . If low dose dasatinib still strong , study doctor may decide take patient study . The patient continue receive supportive care need duration trial well completion trial . During Study Core Period , participant study visit every 4 week . Complete Blood Counts ( CBCs ) obtain every 2 week study purpose disease monitoring . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy obtain screening , 8 week 16 week treatment response assessment . Additional bone marrow aspiration biopsy may obtain time , evaluate disease process , doctor 's judgment . A bone marrow aspirate biopsy must do time study discontinuation . Study Extension Period : The time first 16 week treatment call study extension period . If patient respond treatment , experience disease progression severe adverse event , patient may continue dasatinib treatment 48 week . If patient continue 48 week , ask enroll separate extension study future follow . During Study Extension Period , participant study visit every 4 week . Complete Blood Counts ( CBCs ) obtain every 2 4 week study purpose disease monitoring . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy obtain every 16 week . A bone marrow aspirate biopsy must do time study discontinuation .</detailed_description>
