	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety A Collagen Bupivacaine Implant Women Following Abdominal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysterectomy second common surgery among woman United States ( US ) . According National Center Health Statistics , 617,000 hysterectomy perform US 2004 .

Reducing narcotic pain medication use reduce negative side effect . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medicine ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery .
