	<brief_summary>CIT2 strategy target HAART ( Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ) CNS ( Central Nervous System ) patient HIV associate neurocognitive impairment ( HNCI ) . The primary goal study evaluate effectiveness CNS-targeted ( CNS-T ) compare non-CNS-targeted ( non-CNS-T ) HAART treat HNCI globally different domain function know affected HIV . It hypothesize participant CNS-T arm great improvement neurocognitive function non-CNS-T arm . The secondary goal study compare participant assign CNS-T non-CNS-T HAART measure CNS systemic HIV suppression ( undetectable CSF plasma VL ) . It also hypothesize although CSF viral suppression frequent CNS-T arm , plasma viral suppression similar two treatment arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>`` HIV Neurocognitive Disorders : A Randomized Clinical Trial CNS-targeted HAART '' randomize , control clinical trial ass efficacy strategy target highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) CNS patient HIV associate neurocognitive impairment ( HNCI ) . Contemporary cohort study consistently demonstrate HNCI remain prevalent disorder patient receive HAART . HNCI significant burden person live HIV infection , caregiver , healthcare system . Thus development effective treatment strategy critical public health importance . This study base finding previous study . Briefly , among individual HNCI initiate new antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy regimen , receive highly CNS-penetrating ARV regimens likely successfully suppress cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) viral load ( VL ) , achieve CSF suppression ( VL &lt; 50 c/mL ) well neurocognitive ( NC ) outcomes . These finding suggest NC outcome ART may enhance planned application ARV selection clinical monitoring strategy design optimize treatment CNS infection . In future become increasingly important consider CNS penetration issue select ART regimen . The randomized clinical trial propose would provide level evidence need formulate ART guideline specific HNCI . Subjects eligible trial individual HNCI anticipate initiation new ARV regimen substitution exist regimen follow contemporary treatment guideline . A total 120 patient 3 study site randomize 1:1 receive CNS-targeted ( CNS-T ) ARV strategy versus non-CNS-targeted ( Comparison ) strategy . The primary outcome , change global neuropsychological ( NP ) performance , assess 16 week . CNS-T comprise two component : 1 ) initial selection agent optimize CNS penetration overall regimen ; 2 ) modification regimen interim pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment determine plasma ARV exposure appropriate ( overdose , underdosing ) .</detailed_description>
