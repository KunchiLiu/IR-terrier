	<brief_summary>Stroke third lead cause death United States , responsible 158,488 death 1998 ( American Heart Association ) . Nationwide , year , estimate 600,000 750,000 people suffer new recurrent stroke . Cerebral infarction comprise 80 % stroke result complex series cellular metabolic event occur rapidly interruption blood flow region brain . The extent brain damage dependent duration severity cerebral ischemia . Acute thrombus formation migration principal cause blood flow interruption least 75 % cerebral infarction . In several animal model focal cerebral ischemia , restoration cerebral blood flow within two six hour initial occlusion associate small volume cerebral infarction improve functional outcome . An effective way dissolve thrombus administration recombinant tissue plasminogen activator Activase ( Alteplase , rt-PA ) , promote proteolytic action plasmin plasminogen site clot . In study , drug , Activase , administer subject acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) intravenously ( IV ) local intra-arterial ( IA ) injection . The use intravenous administration within 3 hour stroke symptom onset FDA approve whereas intra-arterial administration , despite evidence potential benefit , currently FDA approve . Although FDA approve , study evaluate effectiveness IA thrombolysis Activase , use AIS high rate recanalization , potential expansion time window 6 hour , low dos thrombolytic agent use compare systemic intravenous Activase . The study design test feasibility provide preliminary safety data regard relative benefit risk IA Activase compare IV Activase administer per NINDS rt-PA stroke study protocol , i.e . randomize within 3 hour onset symptom ischemic stroke treat within 3 hour IV Activase arm within 4 hour IA Activase arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IV vs. IA tPA ( Activase ) Acute Ischemic Stroke With CTA Evidence Major Vessel Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This randomize , control , single center feasibility preliminary safety study determine clinical efficacy Activase administer locally , IA , course angiogram , compare Activase systemic IV infusion , subject ischemic stroke due major vessel occlusion ( M1 , M2 , terminal ICA , basilar vertebral ) detect CT angiography , within 3 hour symptoms onset . IV Activase ( 0.9 mg kg-1 , maximum 90 mg ) administer per NINDS protocol IA Activase ( 2 mg bolus , follow 10 mg hr-1 2 hour TIMI 3 recanalization , whichever early , maximum total dose 22 mg ) administer per protocol use IMS-2 study administration initiate within 4 hour symptom onset complete within 6 hour symptom onset . The subject randomize follow CT angiography demonstration complete occlusion minimal perfusion symptom-related M1 segment and/or M2 , distal ICA , vertebral artery basilar artery . The primary analysis focus feasibility trial term time-frame , preliminary safety analysis ( proportion symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ) preliminary risk-benefit ratio IA Activase compare IV Activase . Secondary analysis include proportion subject exhibit significant neurological improvement , reduction disability recanalization MRA CTA . The sample size feasibility trial estimate take account do single center , involve major investment time , personnel , equipment require . IA thrombolysis compare IV thrombolysis , justified evidence superior clinical efficacy . A large multicenter feasibility trial need plan determine safety estimate sample size efficacy trial . An outside , independent safety monitor assess safety treatment arm . A majority clinical trial involve AIS conduct since NINDS Activase stroke study yield negative result , emphasize point recanalization neuroprotection lead clinical improvement . A recent randomized clinical trial ( PROACT ) show efficacy ( recanalization clinical improvement ) IA thrombolysis Prourokinase acute ischemic stroke &lt; 6 h symptom onset , due occlusion proximal MCA . Although FDA approve , IA thrombolysis Activase , use AIS attractive high rate recanalization , potential extension time window 6 hour symptom onset , low dos thrombolytic agent use compare systemic IV Activase possible low rate symptomatic ICH ( 5-7 % ) compare IA Pro-UK ( 10.9 % ) . Support use IV Activase come mainly NINDS study , whereas IA Activase come PROACT study metanalysis several anecdotal series . However , two therapeutic approach never compare randomize control trial . IA Activase may use AIS due major vessel occlusion , whereas IV Activase may use independent presence absence major vessel occlusion . CT angiography rapidly detect major vessel occlusion hence candidacy IA thrombolysis . An ongoing pilot ( IMS-2 trial ) assessing use combination IV IA thrombolysis compare historical control one draw-back subject subject dual risk hemorrhage IV ( 6 % ) + IA ( 5-7 % ) Activase . The rationale study design follow : - Random assignment : reduce treatment assignment bias . - Controlled : appropriate control group FDA approve IV Activase administration . - Open label : intra-arterial intravenous administration difficult blind observer difference route administration obvious observer subject . Sham intra-arterial stick use camouflage information , may extremely dangerous intra-venous group . - Blinded 90-day assessment : remove assessment bias . Method Treatment Assignment Block randomization ( 1:1 ) use assign equal number subject IV IA arm . In preliminary feasibility study twelve subject randomly assign receive IV ( N=6 ) IA ( N=6 ) Activase . The treatment remain open label treat physician . A physician blind treatment arm ass 90-day outcome . Study Treatment Activase administer IV IA base random assignment . The IV administration accordance FDA approve guideline base NINDS rt-PA stroke study . The IA administration consider investigational accordance ongoing IMS-2 study . Cathetrization Intra-arterial Alteplase protocol : A sheath place femoral artery 1-wall puncture arteriography perform standard technique . If suspect distribution ischemia carotid artery , injection common carotid artery examination carotid bifurcation well intracranial examination perform . If suspect arterial distribution vertebral basilar artery , selective injection vertebral artery perform . Arteriographic examination remainder cerebral vessel perform examination collateral flow brain deem essential determine treatment strategy . Five thousand unit heparin administer IV bolus begin procedure . No post bolus IV heparin administer . Per standard neurointerventional procedure , heparin flush solution ( eg , 1000 U 500 mL ) normal saline ~2 U heparin/min ) use access sheath continue till sheath remove . After perform diagnostic cerebral arteriogram , 3F , taper , variable-stiffness , end-hole microcatheter pass micro-guide wire level occlusion . One milligram Activase inject beyond thrombus catheter retract proximal thrombus additional one milligram Activase inject . A maximum 22 mg Activase administer pulse spray fashion rate 1mg every 6 minute 10 mg/hr 2 hr till maximum dose reach TIMI 3 flow note arteriographic examination . Repeat arteriography perform every 15 minute use isosmolar contrast intra-arterial administration ass recanalization . If vessel patent intra-arterial administration continue . If vessel partially recanalized , infusion catheter introduce vessel thrombus access . If arterial catheter introduce thrombus , Activase administer proximal thrombus describe . The subject 's neurological function evaluate every 15 minute IA procedure , include level consciousness , speech examination , cranial nerve examination , upper extremity motor sensory function . If subject occlusion initial arteriogram vascular territory appropriate subject 's symptom , Activase administer , procedure terminate ( subject include overall analysis ) . If subject significant stenosis occlusion internal carotid , vertebral basilar artery , stenosis/occlusion traverse microcatheter approach distal occlusive thrombus . The use Activase ( IV ) acute ischemic stroke standard care . IA Activase perform clinically , standard care . Intravenous Activase protocol : essentially identical NINDS rt-PA stroke study . In accordance protocol , AIS subject treat IV Activase within 180 minute symptom onset . Symptom onset define usual manner last time subject know asymptomatic . A total dose 0.9 mg/kg body weight ( max 90 mg ) administer , 10 % give IV push 1 minute remainder 90 % IV infusion 1 hour . One week , one month , three month receive Activase IV IA subject spend 10 20 minute talk doctor examine check recovery stroke . In addition , 60 day receive study drug , study coordinator contact subject phone ask question overall feeling health . This telephone contact expect take five minute . One follow-up visit subject leave hospital standard care someone stroke . Other visit telephone call research purpose . Outcome Measures Primary Efficacy Outcome Measures The following primary efficacy outcome measure evaluate : - Feasibility enrol 12 subject major vessel occlusion within 1 year random 1:1 assignment treatment IV ( N=6 ) IA ( N=6 ) IA Activase use follow criterion : - Time clinical radiological assessment - Time IA Activase treatment - Proportion subject receive timely assessment treatment - Preliminary safety assessment : 24 hour symptomatic ICH - Resources utilized risk-benefit IA Activase treatment . Secondary Outcome Measures The following secondary efficacy outcome measure evaluate : - 90-day efficacy outcome include NIHSS , modify Rankin Scale Barthel 's Index . - 24-h recanalization ( TIMI 2/3 ) MRA CTA - Major extracranial bleed ( defined section 3.3.3 ) asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage</detailed_description>
