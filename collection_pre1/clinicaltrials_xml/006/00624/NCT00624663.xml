	<brief_summary>Rivastigmine carbamate , approve FDA treatment mild moderate dementia associate Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease . Studies conduct Israel Institute Biological Research ( IIBR ) yield encouraging result utilizing rivastigmine pre-treatment alternative pyridostigmine partially protect organophosphate poisoning , particularly protect central nervous system . The target population indication may consist otherwise healthy people ( e.g . soldier ) . Although treatment regimen establish yet assume , base animal experiment , rivastigmine likely administer repeated dos . In set , evaluation drug 's effect pharmacokinetics young healthy subject warrant . The objective study : 1 ) To assess safety tolerability repeat rivastigmine administration ( 1.5 mg 3 mg ) young healthy male volunteer ; 2 ) To determine pharmacokinetic profile rivastigmine ( 1.5 mg 3 mg ) follow single multiple dose administration ; 3 ) To assess extent blood ChE inhibition follow single multiple administration rivastigmine 4 ) To correlate physiological behavioral effect blood rivastigmine concentration blood ChE inhibition subject . This double-blind , placebo-controlled study divide 3 identical period , precede two-day initial training perform cognitive performance test . Each period consist in-house confinement 5 day rivastigmine administer 5 time interval 12 hour . During period , subject receive either rivastigmine 1.5 mg X 5 , either rivastigmine 3.0 mg X 5 placebo X 5 . The treatment period randomly assign crossover manner . Rivastigmine pharmacokinetics acetylcholinesterase inhibition assess first last dose period correlate physiological cognitive parameter : performance test , visual function , peak airway flow , saliva production ( sialometry ) vital sign . The emergence adverse event monitor throughout study</brief_summary>
