	<brief_summary>The risk recurrence stage III IV colorectal cancer ( CRC ) high three year follow tumoral resection curative aim . Therefore , prolong follow-up intense monitoring recommend detect recurrence precociously . Nevertheless , current consensual morphological biological examination contributory , difficult interpretation expensive . The metabolic imagery tomoscintigraphy emission positron couple scanner , call PET-TDM , allow identify specifically recurrence , analyze whole body , detect hepatic metastasis precociously give benefice early diagnosis lymph node recurrence . The principle purpose study evaluate systematic follow-up per PET-TDM allow detect often recurrences accessible curative surgery . We make hypothesis systematic practice PET- tomodensitometry ( TDM ) follow-up CRC allow decrease non curative recurrence appearance 3 year follow-up curative surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact PET Scan Curative Strategy Colo-rectal Cancers : A Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize two group : one ( PET-TDM group ) include semi-annual systematic PET-TDM usual follow-up ( M6 , M12 , M18 , M24 , M30 M36 initial surgery ) second ( control group ) one PET-TDM realize current indication ( high isolate marker metastasis curative resection ) usual follow-up . Will include patient high risk recurrence colorectal tumor N+ M+ completely remove ( R0 R1 ) tumor stage 4 , regional lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis ( T4N0M0 ) operate emergency ( tumoral perforation ) . Patients followed-up 3 year since date initial surgery . Conventional follow-up perform consensual recommendation patient . In case detect recurrence , adapt treatment ( surgery chemotherapy ) curative aim implement follow-up carried term death . In case non curable recurrence , follow-up carried term death , PET-TDM realise .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients remove colorectal adenocarcinoma since less 6 month , total remission monitoring necessary detect recurrences precociously . Patients remove colorectal tumour histologically prove classified N+ and/or M+ ( stage III IV ) . Hepatic and/or pulmonary metastasis would totally remove since less 6 month inclusion . Patients T4N0M0 tumour operate emergency ( tumoral perforation ) include . ( suppressed amendment 1 ) 2 criterion replace : Patients colorectal adenocarcinoma histologically prove classified stage II perforate , III IV , totally remove , total remission , metastatic , remove surgery must do since less 6 month ; metastatic , metastasis would remove , last surgery date less 6 month . ( amendment 1 ) Casual extension checkup would realize initial surgery period 6 month surgery perform emergency . informed consent sign Age ≥ 18 year Patient ability undergone hepatic pulmonary resection case recurrence followup ( ECOG ≤ 2 ) Willingness control visit pregnant breast feed woman , reproductive potential practice effective method contraception second part ovarian cycle ( PET realise first part ovarian cycle ) Cancer stage I II ( except T4 operate emergency ) IV without possibility remove metastasis R2 surgery . Performance status contraindicate hepatic pulmonary surgery case recurrence . Patients likely undergone chemotherapy , surgery radiotherapy 2 week PETTDM . Other progressive tumoral affection know , colorectal cancer progression . • ( Bad compliance study procedure . ) ( suppress amendment 1 ) Not balance diabetes . ( added amendment 1 ) Patients include others clinical trial imagery . Inability provide inform consent sign . No social assurance .</criteria>
