	<brief_summary>We investigate new technique test effect drug electrical activity heart . Disturbances electrical activity cause life-threatening change heart rhythm . A good way measure risk recently develop , research team lead world use tool test safety drug use child . Children family want know drug use safe , doctor care . In study , take heartbeat tracing ( ECGs ) 60 child operation . The ECGs check child 's heart specialist . Differences ECGs relate presence amount drug ( droperidol ondansetron ) give . We expect droperidol ondansetron cause change show increase risk abnormal heart rhythm . We tell patient , parent regulatory authority safety profile aspect drug ; moreover , study use model test many drug use hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : examine detail effect droperidol ondansetron Tp-e ( ECG measure dispersion repolarization ) ; search maximum statistical power difference parameter exposure widely use anaesthetic . To investigate nature dose-response relationship propofol mean QTc Tp-e interval . 2 . Hypotheses : 1 . H0 : mean pre-operative Tp-e = mean intra-operative Tp-e within group vs. H1 : mean pre-operative Tp-e ≠ mean intra-operative Tp-e within group . 2 . H0 : mean intra-operative Tp-e group 1 = mean intra-operative Tp-e group 2 = mean intra-operative Tp-e group 3 vs. H1 : mean intra-operative Tp-e group 1 ≠ mean intra-operative Tp-e group 2 ≠ mean intra-operative Tp-e group 3 . 3 . Justification : Droperidol ondansetron anti-emetics . It long thought prolongation repolarization , however cause , predispose rare malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia call torsades de pointes ( TdP ) . The classic model hypothesis group hereditary condition collectively know long QT syndrome . Although rare , condition usually present childhood early adulthood , syncope , abort cardiac arrest sudden death , secondary episode TdP . The genetic mutation affect structure function myocardial potassium channel involve repolarization dynamic . Some anaesthetic agent block potassium channel , thus prolong repolarization , produce acquire long QT syndrome . QT interval prolongation per se associate , cause , TdP . It show recently exaggeration physiological phenomenon call dispersion repolarization ( TDR ) provide right environment trigger TdP . Normal TDR reflect way different layer myocardial wall repolarize different rate - outside fast , inside &amp; finally middle . Physiological TDR also determine morphology T wave surface ECG . The interval peak end T wave measure TDR . We therefore new tool assess risk pose drug prolongs QT interval . Evidence accumulating , TDR increase , risk TdP increase , even QT interval prolong . Conversely , TDR exaggerate , risk TdP raise , even absolute QT interval within normal limit . Whyte &amp; colleague show propofol increase TDR , suggest risk TdP increase agent . That study examine one dose extreme low end range surgical anesthesia &amp; 80 % power . This study design address weakness investigate thoroughly relationship propofol TDR , aim able provide evidence-based recommendation , none currently exist , use patient risk long QT syndrome . 4 . Objectives : ) determine whether significant difference pre post-induction mean QTc interval mean Tp-e interval effect-site target concentration propofol . b ) determine whether relationship propofol dose , mean QTc Tp-e interval . The primary outcome study presence absence difference Tp-e within group child allocate randomization receive droperidol ondansetron combination . For child , endpoint study 5 minute induction anesthesia . 5 . Research Method : randomise , double-blinded within- group comparative study 80 unpremedicated ASA I-II child , age 3 10 year , undergo elective , day case strabismus ; otoplasty ; ear , nose &amp; throat ; dental surgery . After obtain write informed parental consent , patient assent appropriate , enrol patient randomize one 4 group , receive droperidol , ondansetron , combination , saline . Block randomization prepare use computer generate random number . Allocation conceal use seal sequentially numbered opaque envelope . Prior induction anaesthesia , ECG electrodes sit standardised location acquisition pre-operative 12 lead ECG . An intra-operative ECG , use electrode position , take 5 min induction anaesthesia . The patient 's involvement study complete conduct anaesthesia continue discretion supervise anaesthetist . All ECGs record duplicate , paper speed 50 mm/sec identify data automate analysis record trace . Each ECG give random number three-figure code , allow identification pair pre- intra-operative trace analysis . IV access obtain immediately induction . Anaesthesia induce maintain propofol deliver syringe pump . Throughout study period , child receive routine monitoring . In attempt minimize sympathetic stimulation , laryngoscopy permit study period , airway maintain either facemask laryngeal mask . All ECG trace analyse independently two author ( SS SW ) accordance predetermine criterion . Both blind study group status ECG recording ( pre- intra-operative ) . Neither involved recruitment randomisation patient , conduct anaesthesia acquisition ECG recording , perform one investigator . Data analysis : QT Tp-e interval measure complete P-QRS-T cycle lead II V5 average give mean QT interval Tp-e interval lead . The QT interval measure start QRS complex end T-wave , define point return T-P baseline . If U wave present , end T-wave take nadir curve T U wave . The Tp-e interval measure peak T-wave end T-wave . Monophasic T wave peak identify visually . For complex T wave morphology , peak identify accord criterion Emori &amp; Antzelevitch . Bland -Altman plot use compare ECG data two independent reviewer . Where inter-observer difference &gt; 10 msec RR interval &gt; 20 msec QT Tp-e interval find , recording , still cod , re-analysed consensus reach possible . Thus lead trace , two value mean RR interval , mean QTc interval mean Tp-e interval , one independent reviewer , obtain . Each pair value average give overall value , use statistical analysis . Within-group between-group comparison pre- intra-operative ECG index perform use two-way analysis variance . Data analysis conduct AC SDW use Analyse-It® ( Analyse-It software , Leeds , UK ) . Sample size calculation : We base power calculation result previous study lead SDW . Based mean ( SD ) Tp-e 59.5 ( 8.7 ) msec 55 pre-operative ECG trace healthy child , sample size 9 per group detect clinically relevant difference 25 msec Tp-e intra-operative mean four group power &gt; 99 % criterion significance , set 0.01 In order provide small buffer group size , allow unplanned exclusion , allow detection interaction , plan recruit total 80 patient ; 20 four group .</detailed_description>
