	<brief_summary>This prospective , non-randomized multi-center multi-national study evaluate chimerism measure STR SNP patient hypoplastic RC normal karyotype transplant preparative regimen reduce intensity . Primary objective : - To study hematopoietic chimerism whole blood different cell population ( CD14 , CD15 , CD 56 , CD3 , CD19 ) well dendritic cell regulatory T-cells SCT RIC patient RC - To compare result chimerism obtain standard STR PCR ( sensitivity 1 % ) obtain SNP PCR ( sensitivity 0.1- 0.01 % ) Secondary objective : - To evaluate relationship mixed chimerism hematological engraftment , OS EFS - To study impact mixed chimerism plasmacytoid dendritic regulatory T-cells incidence acute chronic GVHD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Question 3.1.1 Chimerism post transplant outcome During past 3 decade , SCT become well establish treatment procedure many malignant hematopoietic disorder child adults.1-8 After transplantation , central interest whether newly develop hematopoietic system recipient donor origin . The investigation genotypic origin post transplant hematopoiesis call chimerism analysis . Originally , believe complete donor hematopoiesis essential maintain engraftment allogeneic SCT humans.9 In last decade , however , become evident donor recipient hematopoiesis could coexist allo-SCT recipient . This state coexistence hematopoietic cell call mixed chimerism might end `` autologous recovery '' . In patient refractory cytopenia SCT myeloablative condition regimen allow prompt sustain engraftment virtually patient . In disease relapse become rare event . Consequently , transplant related mortality long term squeal become major obstacle yet overcome improve child 's well prognosis disease . In SCT RIC , reduction early late toxicity may counterbalance delayed engraftment , graft rejection , mixed chimerism GVHD . Graft rejection It well know less myeloablative conditioning regimen predispose high rate mixed chimerism . Consequently , graft rejection non engraftment major cause treatment failure . Sensitization minor histocompatibility antigens prior transfusion blood product increase risk . The rapid development complete chimerism NK-cells T-cells seem play important role achieve sustain engraftment specifically patient transplant dose reduce preparative regimen . Therefore , important elucidate development post transplant chimerism different cell subpopulation . This allow follow document proper engraftment , detect early hint ongoing graft rejection . Graft versus host disease The occurrence GVHD influence many well known factor . Although use nonmyeloablative SCT reduce severity GVHD , GVHD remain major complication . In pilot study use reduce intensity preparative regimen RC , probability develop GVHD grade IIIV 0.48 . It accept comparison myeloablative SCT , reduce intensity preparative regimens high proportion host immune hematopoietic cell may persist . While donor-derived alloreactive lymphocyte infuse , autologous cell might possibly serve host antigen presentation continuous stimulation donor T-cells . Consequently , speculate group Shapira Slavin10 GVHD may similarly amplify reduce conditioning follow intentional administration host cell . This hypothesis test preclinical animal model . Increased incidence GVHD , high mortality increase level chimerism observe recipient reconstitute additional host cell , particularly non-irradiated spleen cell . Graft-versus-Leukaemia ( GVL ) effect impair post transplant cell administration . These result suggest GVHD may amplify recipient cell infusion use either irradiated viable stimulatory host cell . This could possibly explain high anticipated incidence GVHD consequently rapid displacement host cell conversion 100 % donor type cell reduce intensity SCT . The present study therefore investigate whether autologous antigen present cell ( Auto-APC ) survive condition regimen favour occurrence GVHD .</detailed_description>
