	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy warfarin essential prevention stroke thromboembolic event relate various medical condition increase prevalence old person . However , desire initiate anticoagulant therapy old patient temper concern risk bleeding . The resident nursing home among frail patient geriatric population increase risk drug-related iatrogenic injury physiologic decline pharmacologic change occur age , also special clinical social circumstance characterize set care 1.7 million Americans reside estimate 16,000 nursing home across United States . We previously show prevalence condition warfarin indicate among nursing home resident high , use warfarin among population common , quality management therapy suboptimal . As many 12 % nursing home resident receive warfarin various reason ( nearly 200,000 nursing home resident nationwide ) . While oral direct thrombin inhibitor hold promise less complicated anticoagulant , ximelagatran associate hepatotoxicity yet receive approval Food Drug Administration use U.S. For foreseeable future , warfarin remain sole oral anticoagulant available long-term use elderly . Our prior research conduct auspex AHRQ-funded Center Excellence Patient Safety Research Practice ( PO1HS11534 ) demonstrate overwhelming evidence safety problem warfarin therapy nursing home setting . Based work , conservatively estimate may many 34,000 fatal , life-threatening , serious adverse warfarin-related event per year nursing home setting , majority may preventable . These include bleeds thromboembolic event . Errors warfarin prescribe monitoring responsible nearly preventable event ; inadequate communication information regard prior international normalize ratio ( INR ) value interact medication play important role many event . The research study describe current application resonate AHRQ 's mission Agency 's state research priority FY2006 ( NOT-HS-06-032 ) . This research specifically address gap care relate important medication therapy management issue priority population , elderly resident nurse home , population comprise individual multiple medical condition take multiple medication ; nurse home setting structure pose special challenge subvert effort provide high quality , safe , effective anticoagulation care particularly vulnerable population . The premise underlie propose intervention study error prescribe monitoring warfarin nursing home resident relate problem system care . The system medication management nursing home include nursing staff within facility , physician , laboratory , pharmacy vendor generally external nursing home interact provide service resident . While adverse drug event setting may directly link `` human error '' , root cause may define defect system permit error occur . In case warfarin therapy management nursing home resident , important root cause poor information flow . One example telephone call cover physician resident urinary tract infection without provide crucial information resident take warfarin . The result may order antibiotic interacts warfarin , lead increase risk bleed complication . Many system-level intervention suggest address challenge warfarin therapy management . At present time , technology-based strategy computerize physician order entry clinical decision support less amenable widespread adoption nursing home . Other option specialize anticoagulation service logistically difficult implement expensive . In addition , prior research suggest service yet broad acceptance use nursing home setting . Given limitation , propose low technology intervention improve safety anticoagulation nursing home . The intervention focus maximize effectiveness communication nursing staff physicians nursing home resident warfarin . The intervention build establish approach situation brief draw U.S. armed force : SBAR - acronym stand Situation , Background , Assessment , Recommendation . We test effectiveness approach level adoption acceptance randomize trial , produce disseminate toolkit apply nursing home , well assist living home health setting . If successful , approach serve model improve safety medication category associate high rate preventable adverse drug event , protect nursing home resident special risk medication-related problem . We propose match , cluster-randomized trial , randomization level nursing home , follow specific aim : 1 . To determine whether nurse home warfarin management protocol facilitate communication physician improve quality anticoagulation management . Quality anticoagulation management assess utilize two principal quality measure : 1. proportion time nursing home resident receive warfarin international normalize ratio ( INRs ) within target therapeutic range ; 2. time next INR measurement out-of-range INR . 2 . To determine whether nurse home warfarin management protocol facilitate communication physician low rate adverse event ( bleeds thromboembolic event ) among warfarin-treated resident intervention group nurse home compare control nurse home . 3 . To produce toolkit use nursing home allow dissemination approach enhance quality safety warfarin nursing home setting . We propose perform study 26 nursing home Connecticut . This study take advantage complementary skill experience multidisciplinary research team expertise geriatric medicine , geriatric clinical pharmacology , chronic disease epidemiology , effective clinical communication , gerontological nursing . This study serve extend prior collaborative AHRQ-funded research effort focus long-term care setting , investigator base University Massachusetts Medical School Qualidigm ( formerly Connecticut Peer Review Organization ) , nationally recognize quality improvement organization close link nurse home across state Connecticut .</detailed_description>
