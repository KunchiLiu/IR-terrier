	<brief_title>Genetic Environmental Risk Factors Hemorrhagic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemorrhagic stroke—specifically intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) —affects 50,000 60,000 individual United States year . The consequence type stroke devastate 40 percent case end death within 30 day . Identifying genetic environmental risk factor hemorrhagic stroke beneficial may lead good treatment possible prevention . The purpose research study determine significant environmental genetic risk factor intracerebral hemorrhage ( bleed brain tissue ) subarachnoid hemorrhage ( bleed around brain ) . The researcher look presence several stroke-related gene environmental risk factor hat may contribute stroke people suffer hemorrhagic stroke . Because environmental risk factor vary within different area , study limit physician-reviewed case people hemorrhagic stroke live within 50-mile radius Cincinnati , Ohio . There two primary hypothesis study : 1 . The genetic environmental factor associate spontaneous ICH vary location presume mechanisms rupture artery . To test theory researcher divide physician-reviewed case ICH group base location hemorrhage brain determine risk factor associate group . 2 . The impact environmental genetic risk factor spontaneous ICH SAH population vary gender race . To analyze hypothesis researcher divide physician-reviewed case SAH ICH group base gender race look see polymorphism ( naturally occur variation DNA sequence ) certain stroke-related gene associate certain gender race . The healthy volunteer genetic data play important role area researcher compare healthy participant hemorrhagic stroke . The investigator also look environmental risk factor ( e.g. , smoking , obesity , diabetes , etc . ) prevalent participant hemorrhagic stroke .</detailed_description>
