	<brief_summary>We wish examine safety speed onset give dose 1mg hydromorphone follow additional 1mg . Eligible patient give 1 mg IV hydromorphone . At 15 minute , patient ask question , `` Do need pain medication ? '' Those answer `` yes '' receive additional 1mg IV hydromorphone . Those answer `` '' receive additional pain medication time period ( 15 minute ) . Thus , wish give 2 mg IV hydromorphone titrate patient ' pain , believe result less incidence oxygen desaturation . If study show regimen safe , efficacy assess future trial . Positive result trial may lead use regimen improve pain management emergency department .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age great 21 year : Patients age 21 automatically triaged Children 's Hospital Montefiore Emergency Department , hence enrol study . 2 . Age le 65 year age : Patients age 65 exclude study effect opioids elderly may different nonelderly . 3 . Pain onset within 7 day : Pain within seven day definition acute pain use ED literature . 4 . ED attend physician 's judgment patient 's pain warrant use morphine : The factor influence decision use parenteral opioids complex extensive . An approach commonly take address issue patient selection drug trial use specific condition ( e.g. , renal colic ) treatment ( e.g. , posthysterectomy ) would generally think appropriately treat opioid analgesic , thereby eliminate individual judgment eligibility study . However order assess role hydromorphone wide generalizability ED setting , decide enroll patient variety diagnosis , complaint acute pain . Opioids appropriate treatment patient present complaint pain ( e.g. , gastroenteritis , migraine ) . Therefore , unless restriction patient specific diagnosis , either comprehensive list diagnosis situation opioids indicate must specify , clinical judgment need use . We opt latter alternative . 5 . The use patient variety diagnosis , therefore heterogeneous painful stimulus , risk mask treatment effect large interindividual variability . There several design analytic factor ( detail ) attenuate risk : 1 ) sufficiently large number patient randomly assign group variety painful stimulus equally distribute treatment group ; 2 ) change pain intensity pain relief analyze rather absolute pain intensity pain relief therefore reduce variability . 6 . Normal mental status : In order provide measure pain experienced patient need normal mental status . Orientation person , place time use indicator sufficiently normal mental status participate study . 1 . Prior use methadone : effect methadone use perception acute pain unknown suspect altered . We feel needs patient methadone may exceed dosage ceiling 2mg use study . Similar sickle cell patient chronic cancer patient , patient methadone usually require significantly high dos opioids control pain . Thus , feel would unethical restrict dose subset patient receive . 2 . Use opioids tramadol within past seven day : avoid introduce bias relate opioid tolerance may alter response study medication thereby mask medication 's effect . 3 . Prior adverse reaction hydromorphone . 4 . Chronic pain syndrome : frequently recurrent daily pain least 3 month result alteration pain perception think due downregulation pain receptor . Examples chronic pain syndrome include sickle cell anemia , osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia , migraine , peripheral neuropathy . 5 . Alcohol intoxication : presence alcohol intoxication judge treat physician may alter perception , report , treatment pain . 6 . SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg : Hydromorphone produce peripheral vasodilation may result orthostatic hypotension syncope . 7 . Oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % room air : For study , oxygen saturation must 95 % room air order enrol . 8 . Use MAO inhibitor past 30 day : MAOs report intensify effect least one opioid drug cause anxiety , confusion significant respiratory depression coma . 9 . C02 measurement great 46 : In accordance similar study ( 0412360 ) , three subset patient CO2 measure use handheld capnometer prior enrollment study . If CO2 measurement great 46 , patient exclude study . The 3 subset follow : 1 . All patient history COPD 2 . All patient report history asthma together great 20 packyear smoke history 3 . All patient report less 20 packyear smoke history asthma exacerbation 10 . Pregnancy : determine ask female reproductive age pregnancy status and/or result urine serum pregnancy test .</criteria>
