	<brief_summary>Malaria major public health problem many province Afghanistan failure rate chloroquine ( CQ ) amodiaquine ( AQ ) treat Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) malaria risen 60 % overall high 90 % Jalalabad . CQ remain fully effective P vivax , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) remain effective P falciparum ( 10-15 % case fail cure ) . The current malaria treatment protocol still continue CQ P.vivax adopt Artmisinine base combination therapy ( ACT ) treating ( Pf ) malaria , 50 % malaria diagnose clinically , due operational reason protocol need simplify . By compare 56 day PCR correct cure rate DHA-PPQ standard treatment regimen primary objective comparing safety , gametocytecidal effect parasite clearance time secondary objective , study title : Randomized , Open Label , control , non-inferiority clinical trial comparison Efficacy &amp; safety , provide scientific evidence lead simplification improvement standard malaria treatment regimen Afghanistan ; adopt policy treat vivax falciparum malaria drug regimen . With significance level ( α ) = 0.05 power=80 % , calculated sample size 274 per study arm . Therefore about1100 patient ( 274 per study-arm : 548 patient falciaprum malaria 548 patient vivax malaria ) recruit Malaria reference Centers ( MRCs ) three malaria endemic province ( Nangarhar east , Thakhar north-east Faryab north-west country ) sign write inform consent form , accord inclusion exclusion criterion treat patient give randomized drug dose observation study team followed-up daily 3 day ( treatment course either arm daily dose three day ) weekly day 56. study plan conduct 3 province Afghanistan approximately 2 year . Patients assess clinically well necessary laboratory test perform bio-medical finding record special patient case record form , electronic form broth Trop . Med Mahidol University final analysis . The patient receive reasonable transportation cost follow-up visit well one bed-net end enrollment .</brief_summary>
