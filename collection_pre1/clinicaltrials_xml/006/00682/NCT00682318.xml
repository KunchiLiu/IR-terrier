	<brief_summary>The American Heart Association American College Cardiology ( AHA/ACC ) recently encourage `` increased consumption omega-3 fatty acid form fish capsule form ( 1 g/day ) risk reduction '' state `` treatment elevated triglyceride , high dos usually necessary risk reduction '' ( Smith SC et al . Circulation 2006 ; 113:2363-72 ) . These recommendation base conflict evidence efficacy omega-3 treatment data derive single randomized trial non-randomized study ( Smith SC et al . Circulation 2006 ; 113:2363-72 ) . Much effort undertaken elucidate role omega-3 fatty acid development cardiovascular disease , even recent meta-analyses deliver clear picture ; either favor ( Mozaffarian D Jama 2006 ; 296:1885-99 ) reject ( Hooper L Bmj 2006 ; 332:752-60 ) hypothesis cardioprotective effect omega-3 FAs . The objective clinical study study effect fish oil blood urinary marker inflammation cell stress . By use different permutation high-dose supplementation omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid versus different alimentary omega-3 fish dos grain alcohol versus different kind red wine , trial study omega-3 fatty acid , ethanol red wine constituent modulate biomarkers inflammation cell stress .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 21 60 , Subjects must good health base medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory test . All Subjects adhere follow criterion : Must nonsmoking volunteer ( male nonpregnant female ) due significant influence smoking overweight outcome measure lipid peroxidation , Must normal weight body mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 25 . The correlation BMI number body fatness fairly strong ; however vary sex , race , age . These variation include follow example : At BMI , woman tend body fat men ; BMI , old people , average , tend body fat young adult ; highly train athlete may high BMI increase muscularity rather increase body fatness ; source http : //www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_BMI/index.html . Therefore , subject BMI &gt; 25 enrolled discretion PI writing . Female subject child bear potential must use medically acceptable method contraception ( oral contraception , depoprovera injection , IUD , condom spermicide , diaphragm , cervical cap , progestin implant , abstinence , tubal ligation , oophorectomy , TAH ) throughout entire study period . All female subject must consent urine pregnancy test screen prior start treatment phase study ( first study visit , every ethanol administration visit , first visit fish oil administration ) , third week fish oil administration . All pregnancy test must negative time point . Male subject must surgically sterile and/or agree use condom throughout duration study . Persons consume vitamin supplement require undergo `` washout period '' ≥ five week without supplement prior study enrollment ( analogy Block G , et al . Am J Epidemiol 2002 ; 156 : 274 ) Urine ethanol assessment indicate abstinence . Female subject pregnant nursing child . Subjects , receive experimental drug , use experimental medical device within 30 day prior screen , give blood donation ≥ one pint within 8 week prior screen . Subjects coagulation , bleed blood disorder . Subjects nutritional inefficiency Fe , Zn , Cu , Mg ( accord 61 ) Subjects sensitive allergic fish , fish oil fishcontaining product . Subjects evidence cancer history significant cardiovascular disease ( include stroke TIA ) , renal , hepatic , respiratory , endocrine , metabolic , hematopoietic neurological disorder . Subjects systolic blood pressure 160 diastolic blood pressure 95 , Subjects evidence GI disorder could interfere fat absorption Subjects intention lose weight participation trial Subjects abnormal laboratory value physical find accord investigator may interfere interpretation study result , indicative underlying disease state , compromise safety potential subject . Subjects history drug alcohol abuse within last 6 month . Carbohydratedeficient transferrin &gt; 6 % indicate chronic alcohol abuse Complete abstinence alcohol Intake three alcoholic drink per day Subjects history cancer , include skin cancer</criteria>
