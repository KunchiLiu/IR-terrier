	<detailed_description>Hypertension diabetes widespread disease modern society due comfortable , often unhealthy `` western world '' lifestyle , population suffer consequence constantly grow . Vascular pathology affect body 's entire vascular system subsequently include circulation vessel eye . For reason , diabetic retinopathy vein occlusion rank among common vascular disorder retina , high incidence population age 60 . As prevent severe vision loss due complication induced angiopathy , panretinal segmental laser coagulation recommend standard treatment proliferative retinopathy . So far patient undergo panretinal coagulation typically receive 1200 1500 laser spot two four session course 2 4 week . Clinical guideline recommend exceed number 900 apply laser spot per session , due development possible reversible exudative reaction e.g . macular edema . However , performance panretinal photocoagulation far time consuming procedure generally painful patient . For reason new laser system develop aim solve obvious drawback . Main improvement system reduction laser burn duration per spot enable therefore rapid application large number spot preset pattern . Treatment reduce pulse duration associate less pain patient , compare several session require 30 minute use conventional laser system , treatment time complete panretinal treatment could significantly reduce . The PASCAL® Laser ( Pattern Scan Laser , OptiMedica® Corporation , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) new commercially available laser system confirm requirement . As first study part ( group I II ) propose control randomized comparison single session conventional multisession panretinal laser treatment , use Pascal laser system single-session protocol Pascal laser system conventional laser system multi-session protocol . Development regression retinal exudative reaction eventual onset transient macular edema observe document . The morphological change within retina induce laser burn image mainly use optical coherence tomography technique . In regard determine low laser intensity possible produce visible morphologic effect within small retinal area different laser intensity use photocoagulation retinal segment show effect `` sub-threshold '' gentle laser burn . As second study part ( group III ) , grid pattern laser coagulation perform conventional way use Pascal laser system . In small area retinal perifoveal zone show macular edema , morphologic effect photocoagulation use titrate low , sub threshold threshold laser energy analyze use OCT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent Age 18 year Patients either retinopathy/maculopathy secondary diabetes mellitus type I II medical indication segmental panretinal laser coagulation necessity completion previous incomplete laser photocoagulation . Patients proliferative diabetic retinopathy require panretinal laser treatment ( Group 1 , 2 3 ) Patients macular edema require central focal grid laser treatment ( Group 4 ) . Exclusion criterion : A condition would preclude patient participation study opinion investigator , e.g. , unstable medical status include glycemic control blood pressure .</criteria>
