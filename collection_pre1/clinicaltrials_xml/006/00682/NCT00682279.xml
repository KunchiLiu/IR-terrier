	<brief_summary>This open-label , Phase I study oral topotecan administer combination lapatinib subject advance solid tumor . This Phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics oral topotecan administer combination lapatinib . This study conduct two part . Part 1 study investigate impact lapatinib bioavailability oral topotecan ( bioavailability phase ) Part 2 study consist dose find determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) regimen combination ( dose escalation phase ) . In Part 2 study , dose oral topotecan escalate lapatinib give initially fix dos . The primary objective study determine MTD regimen oral topotecan administer five-consecutive day every 21 day combination daily lapatinib subject advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
