	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate change macular edema absolute change visual acuity follow intravitreal administer injection Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) Ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) compare Triamcinolone ( Volon A® ) patient clinical significant diabetic macular edema . The investigator monitor change macular edema measure standard optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) absolute change visual acuity analyze standardized chart accord protocol use Early Retreatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus common endocrine disease develop country , prevalence estimate range 2 5 % world 's population . Diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema common microvascular complication diabetic patient may lead decrease visual acuity , eventually blindness . The Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study find incidence macular edema 20.1 % younger-onset group 14 25 % patient type 2 diabetes mellitus period 10 year . Diabetic macular edema characterize accumulation extracellular fluid Henle´s layer inner nuclear layer retina . There pathogenesis involve interaction several factor : breakdown blood-retinal-barriers , production biochemical factor , tissue hypoxia , retinal circulatory change vitreous traction . Laser photocoagulation common treatment modality diabetic macular edema . Perifoveal focal/grid laser coagulation find effective save visual acuity 50 % patient diabetic macular edema 3-14 % treated patient improve visual acuity post-operatively . The decent result laser coagulation associate potential side effect paracentral scotoma [ 4 ] , change color discrimination , development epiretinal gliosis subretinal fibrosis expansion laser scar size . In past year , several study investigate effect intravitreal steroid triamcinolone patient diabetic macular edema find significant reduction macular edema . Therefore intravitreal steroid become part standard therapy treatment diabetic macular edema . Furthermore , study show vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) major angiogenic stimulus responsible increase vasopermeability , cell proliferation angiogenesis diabetic retinopathy ( DRP ) . Evaluation VEGF level vitreous indicated role VEGF diabetic macular edema : vitreous sample patient diabetic macular edema contain elevate VEGF concentration injection VEGF experimental study lead breakdown blood-retina barrier . Not age-related macular degeneration also diseases like diabetic macular edema find increase evidence therapeutic role anti-VEGF drug . Intravitreal injections become favored treatment procedure administer anti-VEGF drug . The side effect modest result laser treatment visual acuity diabetic macular edema lead study use anti-VEGF therapy . Unpublished study result aptamer pegaptanib ( Macugen® ) promising . A study use antibody fragment Ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) progress . Currently one anti-VEGF drug already market : Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) , approve intravenous infusion treatment metastatic colo-rectal cancer . Previous study show systemic use Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) obtain promising result patient choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) age-related macular degeneration . This drug , monoclonal full-length antibody , design bind isoforms VEGF , large molecule . But case report patient CNV cause age-related macular degeneration macular edema central retinal vein occlusion indicate intravitreally give Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) effective disease originate choroid also retina . These finding imply sufficient penetration retina Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) . A recent study investigate effect intravitreal bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) patient diabetic macular edema find significant reduction macular edema . Based new finding important role VEGF diabetic macular edema proliferative diabetic retinopathy , propose double-masked , randomise pilot study treatment diabetic macular edema intravitreally administer anti VEGF ( Avastin®/Lucentis® ) compare intravitreally administer triamcinolone ( VolonA® ) .</detailed_description>
