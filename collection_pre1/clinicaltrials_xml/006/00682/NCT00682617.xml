	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis common form arthritis United States . It estimate 20 million Americans arthritis , annual societal cost $ 95 billion . Several exercise study show modest improvement disability , physical performance , pain subject knee osteoarthritis . While similar result suggest hip osteoarthritis , well-designed randomized clinical trial conduct . Exercise program appear beneficial without adherence , beneficial effect exercise knee hip osteoarthritis decline time . A well-designed , evidence-based , arthritis-specific study control exercise duration , frequency adherence need . The objective study determine effect structure exercise program self-reported pain disability adult hip osteoarthritis . This prospective , randomized study wait-list control design develop preliminary data support R01 funding request large , randomized clinical trial . All exercise intervention outcome assessment take place OHSU Orthopaedics Rehabilitation Clinics , Rehabilitation Services physical therapy gym , General Clinical Research Center . Subjects select include individual representative large population document hip osteoarthritis . This three-month study evaluate effect aerobic resistance exercise program pain disability individual hip osteoarthritis . Outcome assessment follow Outcome Measures Rheumatology ( OMERACT ) recommendation core set outcome measure clinical trial arthritis assess pain , physical function , patient global assessment , joint imaging . Data analysis focus compare pre- post-intervention endpoint use conventional statistical analysis repeated-measure analysis variance repeat continuous measure ( e.g . walk distance ) , non-parametric method Chi-square frequency analysis proportion ( e.g . visual pain score ) .</brief_summary>
