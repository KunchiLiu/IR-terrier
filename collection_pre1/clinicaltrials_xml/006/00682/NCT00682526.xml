	<brief_summary>Aim : To determine impact wireless transmission prehospital ECGs hand-held computer time treatment myocardial salvage acute MI patient . Background : The TIME-1 investigator document 27 % ( 109 80 minute ) reduction time EMT arrival scene successful primary PCI implement pre-hospital ECG transmission ED . ECG transmission directly physician 's cellular phone/PDA wireless modem recently become option . The recently complete TIME-NorthEast ( NE ) study test Welch Allyn version system result show reduction time reperfusion acute MI patient 66 minute ( 116 50 ) . Methods : This study involve approximately 20 site around country . The study divide two phase : consecutive control data collection phase ( Phase I ) intervention concurrent control phase ( Phase II ) . Phase II begin installation Welch Allyn ECG transmission equipment . The primary end-point time reperfusion secondary end-points include myocardial salvage , aborted infarction hospital mortality . ECG measurement make central ECG core lab blind investigator . Data Analysis : Patient characteristic three period compare chi-square statistic categorical variable one-way analysis variance age . The Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic use compare time-to-reperfusion pre-study study period well Group 1 post-study period . Comparisons perform separately EMS self-transport group .</brief_summary>
