	<detailed_description>Background : Hypertension affect nearly 50 million Americans [ 1 ] common chronic condition among veteran . Unfortunately , many patient establish hypertension poorly control blood pressure ( BP ) ; control rate VA approximately 70 % currently . While clinician failure aggressively manage hypertension therapeutic intensification ( clinical inertia , failure intensify pharmacotherapy appropriately ) contribute poor blood pressure control , even doctor intensify therapy , 43-78 % patient fail adhere recommended therapy , indicate adherence remain central problem hypertension care . This suggest important opportunity intervention improve risk factor control work clinician , team , delivery system , well patient , address patient adherence clinical inertia . Objectives : Recognizing importance understand intervene improve adherence antihypertensive medication address clinical inertia , VA HSR &amp; D fund numerous study last decade address issue , either intervention exploratory study well understand problem . There little discussion among investigator clinical manager comparative effectiveness approach -- practice 'best ' use VA , base evidence emerge study . Thus , conduct evidence synthesis project accomplish aim , order summarize literature facilitate exchange among investigator clinician implication grow body VA research . Methods : We seek catalog extensively describe VA fund study conduct past decade focus adherence antihypertensive medication , therapeutic intensification , . We also include non-VA funded study focus care veteran receive health care VA. We aim describe gap current research identify important area future research , synthesize result study , whether publish unpublished , form evidence synthesis , build effort develop formal exchange collaboration among VA researcher clinician work address important issue . Status : Complete .</detailed_description>
