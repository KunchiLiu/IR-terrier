	<brief_title>Hair Cortisol Risk Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute physical stressor surgery , trauma intense physical exertion well-known trigger cardiovascular event . The connection acute emotional stress heart controversial many year . However , emotional stressor increasingly recognize precipitant cardiovascular event include myocardial infarction ( MI ) . For example , day Los Angeles earthquake 1994 number cardiac death hospital admission acute myocardial infarction 2-5 time higher usual rate . Furthermore , risk myocardial infarction short period follow acute emotional stress anger outburst , seem twice period may common precipitant physical exertion1 . While association acute stress cardiovascular mortality morbidity well establish , controversy still exist whether association chronic stress , physical emotional . Data regard question extremely limited since objective reliable mode assessment physical stress quantification overall chronic stress . Furthermore , fact information regard association chronic stress acute MI derive retrospective study complicate issue . Both physical emotional stress activate several neuroendocrine system , important hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulate production secretion glucocorticoid ( especially cortisol ) adrenal cortex . Therefore , cortisol consider `` stress hormone '' high level serum cortisol observe patient acute stress present acute MI , compare healthy control . Currently , several modality measure cortisol level include serum , urinary salivary technique . However , method represent indicator acute stress reflect accumulation stress time . Recently grow interest measure hair cortisol level . Hair grow approximately 1 centimeter per month , hair analysis accurately reflect long-term endogenous production cortisol . This provide first time reliable mode measurement accumulation cortisol time potential biomarker chronic stress . Indeed , several report demonstrate association high hair cortisol level chronic stress animal model human . Nevertheless , possible association hair cortisol risk acute MI study yet . Aim study : To evaluate whether hair cortisol level elevate patient admit acute MI compare control .</detailed_description>
