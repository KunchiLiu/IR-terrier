	<detailed_description>Vitamin D essential nutrient play important role calcium metabolism bone health . In recent year , biomarkers like PTH , calcium absorption use define relevant biological index vitamin D nutritional status . Prevalence 25 ( OH ) D Asian Indians Several study India show wide prevalence vitamin D deficiency ( VDD ) India , Goswami et al study serum 25 ( OH ) D level functional significance apparently healthy subject reside Delhi . In study three group subject ( soldier , depigmented person physician nurse ) study winter . Other three group namely pregnant woman , newborn physicians nurse study summer . All group except one maximum sunlight exposure ( soldier ) subnormal concentration serum 25 ( OH ) D level . Vitamin D deficient group tend imbalance bone mineral homeostasis expose winter low dietary calcium high dietary phytate , significantly low serum calcium elevate PTH.On basis study relate intestinal calcium absorption , inverse relation serum iPTH concentration protection fracture risk , recent consensus suggest ideal health base normal cutoff circulate serum 25 ( OH ) D would least 32 ng/mL . Interestingly , use consensus , recent study conduct AIIMS , Goswami et al , show 94.3 % apparently healthy northern Indian subject reside Delhi vitamin D deficient ( AJCN 2006 , BJN 2008 ) . Functional Significance 25 ( OH ) D deficiency Though several study highlight widespread prevalence 25 ( OH ) D Asian Indians , paucity data functional significance . Relevant study assess functional significance VDD Asian Indians summarize ( Am J Clin Nutr 2000 ) . A ) Effects Serum PTH level Goswami et al report low serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration healthy subject Delhi , show high serum PTH level &amp; significant inverse relation serum 25 ( OH ) D PTH level ( r = -0.6303 , p &lt; 0.001 ) three group ( soldier , physician &amp; nurse , depigmented person ) study winter ( Am J Clin Nutr 2006 ) B ) Effects BMD Recently , analyze relationship BMD serum 25 ( OH ) D 105 apparently healthy Asian Indian . The cohort 105 subject split 2 group serum 25 ( OH ) D cutoff 9.0 ng/mL . The mean serum iPTH significantly high group 1 ( &lt; 9.0 ng/ml ) group 2 subject ( 53.1±31.3 39.3±17.5 pg/mL , respectively ; P=0.012 ) .The mean BMD value total hip , include femoral neck , trochanter , intertrochanter , significantly ( P = 0.001 ) low group 1 group 2 . C ) Effects intestinal calcium absorption Effect VDD intestinal calcium absorption Asian Indians chronic hypovitaminosis D change cholecalciferol supplementation study recently Department Endocrinology Metabolism . Study subject 29 apparently healthy volunteer [ 17 M , 12 F , mean ( SD ) age = 28.4 ± 6.4 year ] low serum 25 ( OH ) D level [ mean ( SD ) = 7.6 ± 4.8 ng/ml ] . Intestinal calcium absorption assess 'calcium load test ' ( PAK test ) ( 10 ) use 1 gm oral elemental calcium load ( n = 26 ) supplementation oral cholecalciferol ( 60,000 IU/week eight week ) . This study show vitamin D Deficiency physiologically relevant term intestinal calcium absorption Asian Indians . D ) Effects physical performance relate skeletal muscle strength Zamboni et al show significant association serum 25 ( OH ) D level muscle strength physical performance notice 6 - minute walk test elderly woman . However date study systematically assess role cholecalciferol supplementation improve muscle strength randomize placebo control trial apparently healthy chronic hypovitaminosis D. The present study would include 40 apparently healthy volunteer ( medical paramedical staff ) . Complete evaluation daily dietary intake include calcium phytic acid do semiquantitative frequency questionnaire 24 - h recall method use publish data nutritive value Indian food . Subjects enquired average duration sun exposure 10 a.m. 4 p.m. average body surface area expose . Baseline evaluation ( Before vitamin D supplementation ) Serum total calcium , inorganic phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , intact PTH 25 ( OH ) D assay . At baseline , assessment bone density hip , spine forearm would also perform DEXA At baseline isokinetic gastrosoleus strength test do use computerized dynamometer ( Biodex Medical System ) Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation guidance Professor U Singh , Head , Department Department Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation , AIIMS.. Subjects perform three maximal planter flexion repetition right low limb 180 degree/sec . The peak strength record Newton . Handgrip strength measure right hand hand dynamometer . The average two measurement grip strength use analysis ( kg ) . The respiratory muscle strength test do use digital instrument ( Micromedical respiratory pressure meter ) measure maximal inspiratory pressure &amp; maximal expiratory pressure Department Medicine guidance Dr Randeep Guleria . The physical performance test perform 6 - minute walk test use standard protocol result interpret term 6 minute walk distance meter degree shortness breath use modify Borg dyspnea scale . 31P MRI spectroscopy would perform subject muscle energy parameter , department Nuclear Magnetic Resonance guidance Professor NR Jagnathan . The mRNA expression Th1 Th2 cytokine would assess PBMC draw 5 ml peripheral blood use real time PCR . Vitamin D supplementation All 40 subject randomize 1:1 ratio ( Active : placebo ) treatment group placebo group 2:1 ratio double blind manner . Random code would generate investigator , involve distribution medicine assessment muscle strength Active drug would calcium ( two tablet calcium carbonate contain 500 mg elemental calcium/day , 60,000 IU cholecalciferol/week obtain commercial source . The inactive drug would lactose contain identical placebo obtain source . All study subject provide packet contain four sachet cholecalciferol ( contain 60000 IU vitamin D3 ; Cadila Pharmaceutical , India ) /placebo ; sixty tablet calcium carbonate ( 500mg elemental calcium &amp; 250 IU vitamin D3 ; Elder Pharmaceutical , India ) /placebo . First dose supervise . Subjects counsel daily intake two tablet calcium carbonate weekly intake cholecalciferol sachet follow completion 4 week . Similar packet give 4 week follow . Drug compliance assess count empty sachet . After eight week subject provide daily two tablet calcium carbonate contain 500 mg elemental calcium 250IU Vitamin D3 . Assessment 8 week , 6 month , 1 year Repeat evaluation 8 week six month one year would include serum intact PTH &amp; 25 ( OH ) D level estimation , skeletal muscle strength testing , respiratory muscle strength test 6 minute walk test 31P MRS Th1/Th2 analysis Safety Proposed Interventions Cholecalciferol dose 60000 IU/week × 8 week consider safe use healthy subject , show recent study . Also another study do Department Endocrinology Metabolism , AIIMS DM dissertation work Dr. Ajay Gupta , dosage vitamin D supplement cohort 29 apparently healthy individual . None study subject develop hypercalcemia hypercalciuria . Study A Malabanan et al ( Lancet 1998 ) also show 50000 IU replacement vitamin 8 week effectively normalize 25 ( OH ) D level , corrects secondary hyperparathyroidism adverse effect .</detailed_description>
