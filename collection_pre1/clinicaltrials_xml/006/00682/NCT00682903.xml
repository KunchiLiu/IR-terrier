	<brief_summary>The objective project evaluate advantage use bearable continuous interstitial glucose monitoring device ( GuardianR ) educative session diabetic patient dedicate functional insulin therapy teaching . This concept intensify treatment base test explanation simplify decision make algorithms adapt insulin dose every true life condition . As self monitoring capillary glucose level need validate algorithm , postulate use device able permanently control interstitial glucose readable medical team patient ( session 5 follow day discharge ) could significantly improve safety efficiency educative session .</brief_summary>
