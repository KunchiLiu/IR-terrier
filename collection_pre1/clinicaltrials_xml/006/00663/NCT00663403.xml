	<brief_summary>Daptomycin antibiotic affective many strain antibiotic resistant microorganism . This antibiotic would appropriate use intensive care unit ( ICU ) consider severity illness high risk infection within hospital environment . While ICU , patient may develop acute renal failure . Approximately 75 % ICU patient develop acute renal failure require form renal replacement therapy kidney recover . Continuous hemodialysis become one common form dialysis ICU gentle type dialysis provide long period time . The current data demonstrate ability continuous hemodialysis remove daptomycin body derive in-vitro trial . The purpose trial determine extent daptomycin removal critically ill patient receive continuous hemodialysis . Findings trial use develop new dose recommendation daptomycin continuous hemodialysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Daptomycin FDA approve antibiotic . This pharmacokinetic trial monitor daptomycin drug concentration continuous hemodialysis . The daptomycin concentration profile develop study assist develop dose recommendation result daptomycin level safe within therapeutic range , previously identify , critically ill patient acute renal failure treat continuous hemodialysis .</detailed_description>
