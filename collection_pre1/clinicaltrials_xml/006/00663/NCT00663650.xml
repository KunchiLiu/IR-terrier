	<brief_title>Periocular Basal Cell Carcinoma ( BCC ) : Permanent v . Frozen Section Pathological Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) account 80-90 % skin cancer common skin cancer periocular region . Surgical excision consider gold-standard therapy . Previous literature show comparable recurrence rate BCC surgical excision frozen section control surgical excision permanent section control . To data , prospective study compare frozen section control permanent section control . We hypothesize short term tumor clearance rate frozen section permanent section control similar long-term tumor recurrence rate similar two technique . If find two treatment option equivalent respect margin control recurrence rate , considerable time money saving accrue use permanent section control amongst patient periocular BCC . The study design single-blind randomized control trial . Patients already agree surgical excision nodular type periocular BCC eligible . All patient undergo detailed informed consent process . All patient undergo punch biopsy confirm histopathological diagnosis BCC . The study design single-blinded , randomized clinical trial . Statistically , study design equivalency study . Prior randomization BCC excise 3mm clinical margin standard fashion . Subjects randomize one two group : 1 . Frozen section control ; 2 . Permanent section control . For patient randomized permanent section control clinical sample send pathologic analysis surgical reconstruction perform immediately use standard oculoplastic technique . Patients randomize frozen section additional margin re-excised necessary depend pathologic result . Oculoplastic reconstruction perform margin clear . Patients undergo examination follow time assess clinical recurrence : 1 . 2 week necessary thereafter assess surgical result wound healing , 2 . 6 month , 3 . 1 year , 4. yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
