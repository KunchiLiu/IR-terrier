	<brief_summary>In Emergency Department ( ED ) , diabetes commonly encounter secondary diagnosis many patient uncontrolled diabetes admit hospital initial evaluation ED . Currently guideline US management hyperglycemia patient diabetes duration evaluation treatment ED . It known high blood glucose level hospitalize patient diabetes associate increased risk medical complication . In study , hypothesize define two-step approach management high blood sugar insulin injection initiate ED may decrease length stay ED hospital , improve clinical outcome prevent hospital complication . In first phase , patient diabetes admit ED high blood sugar ( BG 200mg/dL ) randomize receive schedule aspart usual care dictate ED physician . In second phase , patient enrol first phase subsequently admit hospital receive combination detemir aspart insulin usual care dictate Admitting Medicine Team . Detemir long-acting insulin give subcutaneously ( skin ) daily . Aspart rapid-acting insulin give subcutaneously several time day frequently meal . Detemir aspart insulin approve use treatment patient diabetes FDA . Usual care oral anti-diabetic agent , subcutaneous insulin therapy combination . Subcutaneous insulin use usual care could include NPH , 70/30 insulin , aspart insulin , regular insulin insulin glargine . This investigator-initiated research conduct Grady Memorial Hospital , Atlanta Rush University Medical Center , Chicago , IL . Dr. Smiley serve principal investigator Atlanta site . A total 120 patient recruit Grady 120 patient Rush University Medical Center , Chicago , IL . This study support Novo Nordisk .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion consider enrollment study : Males female age 18 80 year admit general medical service . A known history type 2 diabetes mellitus &gt; 3 month , receive diet management , combination oral antidiabetic agent ( sulfonylurea , metformin , thiazolidinediones ) and/or insulin therapy . Subjects must admission blood glucose &gt; 140 mg &lt; 400 mg/dL evidence ketoacidosis ( serum bicarbonate &lt; 18 mEq/L , venous arterial pH &lt; 7.30 , positive serum urinary ketone ) . Subjects increase blood glucose concentration , without know history diabetes . Subsequent find diabetic ketoacidosis hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome initial evaluation . Patients acute critical surgical illness and/or expect require admission critical care unit ( ICU , CCU ) , undergo surgery hospitalization course . History current drug alcohol abuse . Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study Inability give inform consent Female patient pregnant breast feed Patients clinically significant liver disease ALT/AST &gt; 3 X upper range normal Patients serum creatinine ≥3.5 mg/dL male ≥ 3.0 mg/dL female currently treat dialysis</criteria>
