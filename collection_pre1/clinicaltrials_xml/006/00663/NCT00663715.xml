	<detailed_description>The sciatic nerve block frequently use anesthesia analgesia surgery low extremity . Ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block perform lateral mid-femoral level successfully describe subject supine position lower limb elevate order accommodate ultrasound probe posterior aspect thigh . In pediatric set nerve block commonly perform patient anesthetized rather awake , find technique unwieldy single-operator technique . Using ergonomic approach previously describe , plan identify describe sciatic nerve ultrasound position lateral aspect thigh . We hope describe appearance sciatic nerve location relation adjacent anatomic structure use modified approach . This prospective cross-sectional study 40 pediatric subject 11-17 year age . Three ultrasound image sciatic nerve obtain via lateral mid-thigh approach 40 pediatric patient schedule undergo sciatic nerve block - first image prior placement block , second nerve locate stimulate needle third injection local anesthetic .</detailed_description>
