	<brief_title>IMPAACT P1063 : Safety Effectiveness Atorvastatin HIV Infected Children Adolescents With Hyperlipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral regimen , particularly contain PIs , often cause hyperlipidemia , increase amount fat ( cholesterol triglyceride ) blood . These increase lead heart disease pancreatitis . Although mechanism PIs cause hyperlipidemia clearly understood , medication combat side effect . The primary purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness escalate dos atorvastatin , base low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , HIV-infected child receive stable antiretroviral therapy . Participants assign one two group base age ( 10 14 year 15 23 year ) treat maximum 48 week . The first six participant enrol study 15 23 year old age group . Once safety data week 8 6 participant analyzed , remain participant enrol . All participant receive atorvastatin combination stable antiretroviral regimen . Each participant follow independently accord dose escalation algorithm atorvastatin . Participants begin dose 10 mg daily . If efficacy criterion meet , dose increase 20 mg daily week 8 . Since dose escalation do within subject , safety efficacy rate present dose-escalation strategy overall individual dos . Atorvastatin provide study , antiretrovirals . Study visit occur study entry week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . Safety lab collect study visit . Blood collection lipid measurement occur week 4 , 12 , 24 48 .</detailed_description>
