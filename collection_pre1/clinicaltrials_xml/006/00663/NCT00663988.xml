	<detailed_description>Severe facial deformity cause burn , trauma , tumor resection , usually organs defect , ear , nose , eyelid , lips tissue defect involve skin , fat tissue , muscle , cartilage , bone etc . The optimal reconstruction specialize unit difficult achieve.1 The face simply mask functional , dynamic important aesthetic organ . The function face include talk , smile , eat , wink . The reconstructive challenge complicate fact human eye look detect slight abnormality another 's face . Traditional reconstructive procedure include free skin graft , application local flap , tissue prefabrication , tissue expansion , free tissue transfer . Despite application meticulous technique artistic creativity , even skillful surgeon reproduce complex part body . Facial reconstruction still tough challenge surgeon . In recent year , progress composite tissue allotransplantation , come new hope severely disfigured patient . The apparent success human hand allotransplantation late 1990s laid immunological ethical groundwork perform human facial allotransplantation let surgeon consider use donor facial tissue reconstruct severe facial deformities.The outcome hand forearm transplantation successful might predict nevertheless quite high incidence rejection , general control additional immunosuppression , also chronic rejection see cases5 . But facial transplantation , inevitably encounter many problem , different hand transplantation . Reports Royal College Surgeons England outline problem potential side face transplantation , include technical failure , acute rejection , chronic rejection , side effect immunosuppressive therapy , noncompliance immunosuppressive medication , psychologic societal issue , ethical issue , et al.So Jean-Michel Dubernard say face transplantation much difficult hand technically . To solve problem , many expert conduct related study . Ulusal et al build first facial/scalp flap transplantation model rat . Cyclosporine A used prevent acute chronic allograft rejection transplantation . Experts use animal facial transplantation model study blood supply , tolerance induction , donor-specific chimerism , medication . Cleveland Clinic Foundation carry series study cadaver facial allograft transplantation preparation facial transplantation humans.Since 2002 , study facial transplantation build half facial transplantation model rabbit . We choose Ciclosporin A , Azathioprine Prednisone immunosupressants get good result . Since late 1990s , progress study strongly suggest facial transplantation bound success . In November 2005 , first partial facial transplantation carry successfully get good result Amiens , France . The recipient , 30 year old man , come remote village Yunnan province , China . His face scratch bear October 2004 . Shortly disaster , treat debridement repair leave forearm pedicle flap . But efficacy conventional technique satisfactory facial wound heal , seriously affect appearance function , even normal work life . He arrange stay hospital examination treatment March 11 , 2006 . The major defection patient 's face involve extensive skin soft tissue right buccal division combine severe cicatricial contracture deformity , upper lip , total nose , front wall right maxillary sinus , lateral right orbital wall infraorbital wall , right zygomatic bone , large portion right parotid gland . Examinations show panel reaction antibody ( PRA ) high ( 99 % 98 % two separate examination ) , implied recipient belong highly sensitive crowd . It well know highly sensitive patient PRA often present acute rejection . To decrease PRA also risk surgery , immunoadsorption column Protein A use . Reexaminations show PRA 5 % ( two separate examination ) surgery . Other medical examination show surgical contraindication . For patient , traditional reconstructive procedure , include free skin graft , application local flap , tissue prefabrication , tissue expansion , free tissue transfer , cover wound . Without bony framework , reconstruction nose hard traditional procedure . And reconstruction upper lip hard . Face transplantation appropriate operative indication patient..</detailed_description>
