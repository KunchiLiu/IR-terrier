	<brief_title>Kidney Transplantation Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease common disease African-American population . In sickle cell disease red blood cell abnormal shape damage organ . In particular , patient sickle cell disease damage kidney , result renal failure . The number patient develop renal failure sickle cell disease unknown . This largely due high mortality patient sickle cell disease renal failure . There two type renal replacement therapy available patient sickle cell disease- dialysis kidney transplantation . The best form renal replacement therapy determine patient sickle cell disease renal failure . There approximately 190 renal transplant perform United States since 1988 patient sickle cell disease . Patients well , survive long patient cause renal failure . It appear patient sickle cell disease meet criterion kidney transplantation may derive benefit transplantation rather undergoing dialysis . We perform study follow patient sickle cell disease receive renal transplant . We hope learn best way manage patient sickle cell disease improve survival transplanted kidney patient . In addition , study immune system respond receive kidney transplant sickle cell patient . We hope information learn immune system allow u prevent injury new kidney transplant allow good outcome sickle cell patient .</detailed_description>
