	<brief_summary>Background : - In elderly individual , age-associated decline immune system ability function believe contribute increase incidence infection , autoimmune disorder , cancer . This decline immune system function may relate decline body production growth hormone , help regulate human development may contribute health immune system . Researchers interested study whether growth hormone , give infusion time , improve function immune system body system associate good health . Objectives : - To study effect growth hormone administration immune system healthy men . Eligibility : - Healthy men 25 50 year age . Design : - This protocol involve three separate study : Study I , Study IB , Study II . Participants Study I Study IB may participate Study II direct researcher . - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , provide blood , urine , stool sample ; glucose tolerance test ; test require researcher . - Participants infusion pump small catheter insert beneath skin administer study chemical ( either growth hormone placebo ) . - Study I Study IB participant receive pulse growth hormone infusion pump regular interval monitor body response hormone . Study IB participant receive high dose growth hormone Study I participant . - Throughout study period , participant frequent blood urine test , well test glucose tolerance metabolism , image study , test require researcher . - Study II participant divide two group . The first group receive pulse either growth hormone placebo infusion interval throughout day 4 week , follow 8-week period without infusion . The second group receive conventional once-a-day infusion growth hormone placebo 4 week , follow 8-week period without infusion . - Throughout study period , participant frequent blood urine test , well test glucose tolerance metabolism , image study , test require researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Specific Aims : We plan investigate whether growth hormone , administer physiological pulsatile fashion , elicit relevant change human immune system time associate change even improvement metabolic profile insulin sensitivity . Experimental Design Methods : Thirty-eight healthy men , age 25-50 , recruit study . There three part study : Study I , Study IB Study II . Study I IB involve six subject design test hypothesis pulsatile subcutaneous infusion GH via subcutaneous infusion pump yield reasonable pulsatile GH pattern . The dose GH use Study IB three-fold higher Study I . Study I IB do first proceed Study II . Study II randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled 12-week study involve 26 subject divide 2 group : Group A Group B . Group A involve 13 subject receive pulsatile GH placebo infusion 4 week 8-week washout intervention . Group B involve 13 subject receiving conventional day subcutaneous infusion GH placebo 4 week 8-week washout intervention . Medical Relevance Expected Outcome : This study ascertain significance effect pulsatile growth hormone administration human immune system metabolic profile .</detailed_description>
