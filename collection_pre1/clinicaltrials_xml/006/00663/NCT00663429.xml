	<brief_summary>This study extension study Callisto protocol CP-106 . Subjects must complete 12 treatment cycle CP-106 without disease progression per RECIST criterion , eligible enrol study . This study evaluate safety efficacy atiprimod treatment patient low intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic unresectable local-regional cancer either symptom ( diarrhea , flush and/or wheeze ) despite standard therapy ( octreotide ) progression neuroendocrine tumor ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study Safety Efficacy Atiprimod Treatment Neuroendocrine Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For carcinoid , despite many cytotoxic chemotherapy trial conduct , regimen demonstrate response rate 20 % use criterion 50 % reduction bidimensionally measurable disease . In recently report ECOG phase III study chemotherapy carcinoid tumor ( E1281 ) , patient randomly assign treatment 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) plus doxorubicin 5FU plus streptozocin . The median progression free survival duration disappoint . They 4.5 month 5FU plus doxorubicin arm 5.3 month 5FU plus streptozocin arm . Overall survival duration record trial also suboptimal 15 24 month respectively . There clear survival benefit cytotoxic chemotherapy . This phase II , multi-center , open-label extension study safety efficacy atiprimod treatment patient low intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic unresectable local-regional cancer either symptom ( diarrhea , flush and/or wheeze ) despite standard therapy ( octreotide ) progression neuroendocrine tumor ( ) ( define appearance one new lesion 20 % increase sum long diameter target lesion 6 month prior enrollment CP-106 ) . Atiprimod administer orally single daily dose 60 mg/day 14 day , follow 14-day treatment-free period ( i.e. , 1 treatment cycle = 28 day ) .</detailed_description>
