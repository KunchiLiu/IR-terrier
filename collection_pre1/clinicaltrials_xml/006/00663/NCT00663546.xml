	<brief_summary>This study , conduct National Center Parasitology , Entomology Malaria Control Cambodia Ministry Health National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases , explore whether follow factor confer protection malaria associate anemia : certain blood group , hemoglobin E variant , G6PD-deficiency alpha-thalassemia . Malaria cause parasite ( P. falciparum P. vivax ) transmit human mosquito bite . This protocol include two study , cohort study P. vivax collection study . Individuals eligible enrollment study follow : Cohort study : Residents age Kandal , Ekapheap Sangkumthmey village ( Thmar Da commune ) plan remain Thmar Da commune next 5 year . P. vivax collection study : 2 year age old Participating NIAID protocol 05-I- N210 ( Severe Malaria Anti-malarial Drug Resistance Cambodia ) diagnose P. vivax malaria Participants undergo follow procedure : Cohort study : Baseline evaluation , include follow : - Collection demographic information - Malaria history , temperature measurement review current symptom , - Blood draw 300 microliters - Additional blood draw 10 milliliter select adult 18 year age old Treatment artesunate-piperaquine commune health post subject develop malaria Contact year 5 year determine continue residency Thmar Da commune P. vivax collection study : - Medical history physical examination - Hemoglobin level measurement - Blood draw - Treatment chloroquine - Blood draw 3 5 week treatment patient 18 year age old</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cohort study . Hemoglobin ( Hb ) red blood cell ( RBC ) polymorphisms give rise HbE , alpha-thalassemia , G6PD-deficiency , ABO blood group occur high frequency along Thailand-Cambodia border , Plasmodium vivax P. falciparum continue transmit . To determine whether Hb/RBC polymorphisms naturally select confer protection malaria malaria-associated anemia , conduct cohort study ethnic Khmer Cambodia . Approximately 1000 individual age genotyped four polymorphism list follow 5 year determine mean incidence rate P. vivax P. falciparum malaria , stratify genotype . Incidence rate ratio ( IRRs ) calculate polymorphism relative wildtype genotype . Differences Hb level acute episode malaria Hb level baseline also calculate determine Hb/RBC polymorphism influence degree malaria-associated anemia . P. vivax collection study . Unlike P. falciparum , P. vivax efficiently cultivate vitro . Improved cultivation method need make progress nearly aspects P. vivax malariology , include pathogenesis , naturally-acquired immunity , vaccination , antimalarial drug resistance . We plan improve short- long-term cultivation method order test various hypothesis P. vivax pathogenesis protection . Using freshly obtain parasite isolates individual P. vivax malaria , test whether Hb/RBC polymorphism influence potentially pathogenic property P. vivax parasite , ability bind non-infected RBCs host cell . It believe P. vivax selectively invades reticutocytes . This tropism frustrate attempt long-term cultivation parasite , require constant source reticulocyte-rich blood easily obtain even developed country . The host reticulocyte receptor mediate highly selective tropism P. vivax identify . Fresh P. vivax parasite also use vitro experiment identify putative receptor defines reticulocyte tropism . Any P. vivax ligand bound selectively reticulocyte receptor discover worked promising vaccine candidate .</detailed_description>
