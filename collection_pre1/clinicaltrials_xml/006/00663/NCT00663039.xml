	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia complex heritable disorder encompass several clinical symptom domains functional impairment . Existing treatment schizophrenia , although effective positive symptom , fail benefit negative symptom , focus current protocol . One strategies novel drug development depend identify heritable physiological deficit mark disease liability think occur along causal pathway negative symptom . These heritable physiological deficit often find biological relative schizophrenia proband ; particularly schizophrenia related personality style [ define schizophrenia spectrum personality ( SSP ) diagnostic system ] , even though full-blown illness . The current protocol pilot strategy target biomarkers negative symptom use intranasal oxytocin relative schizophrenia patient . The drug probe study non-clinical sample several advantage include absence drug treatment may modulate response , lack generalize deficit cause problem task comprehension/engagement may mute therapeutic signal . In addition , find efficacy experimental drug target physiological deficit associate symptom clinical implication right . This 25 % subject schizophrenia spectrum personality disorder experience serious functional impairment . Oxytocin extensively use drug , well tolerate serious side effect . Several line evidence suggest putative role treatment negative symptom , particularly lack social drive relate symptom .</brief_summary>
