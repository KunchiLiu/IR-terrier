	<brief_summary>Diverticulosis ( bulge bowel wall ) affect two third elderly population UK . Diverticular disease complication responsible 68000 hospital admission 2000 death per year . It commonly produce recurrent short live abdominal pain , change bowel habit incontinence . The cause symptom know treatment unsatisfactory . Recent study find association inflammation , alteration bowel nerve symptom . Mesalazine anti-inflammatory drug use inflammatory bowel condition , ulcerative colitis crohn 's disease . We plan perform randomized double blind ( neither patient doctor know treatment patient take ) placebo ( sham medication ) control trial mesalazine symptomatic diverticular disease patient . We anticipate reduction amount inflammation , bowel nerve change symptoms patient take mesalazine compare take placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanistic Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) Mesalazine Symptomatic Diverticular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diverticular disease affect two third elderly population United Kingdom . Only small fraction individual diverticulosis develop symptom , perhaps 1 10 , reason well understood . The symptom however quite disable find recent survey indicate around 36 % suffer recurrent abdominal pain . Surprisingly , give severity disability little research factor predict development painful diverticular disease . Recent study indicate however may inflammatory component since best predictor recurrent abdominal pain previous episode acute diverticulitis . Just initiate attack acute diverticulitis poorly understood may include inspissation fecal material diverticulum lead pressure line epithelium break barrier function . This allow colonic bacteria enter lamina propria cause acute inflammation , attract pu cell circulate blood create micro-abscesses . The resolution involve fibrosis scar together muscular hypertrophy may well lead secondary motor abnormality . Patients symptomatic diverticular disease know higher intraluminal pressure , baseline response stimulus meal prostigmine . A recent report patient admit acute diverticulitis follow two year find high proportion individual subsequently develop recurrent chronic abdominal pain . Recent work indicate leaves permanent change mucosal innervation . Markers nerve injury include galanin substance P upregulated patient symptom oppose without . This first time objective marker show distinguish patient basis symptom . While acute diverticulitis may initiate insult , chronic low level inflammation may also require maintain visceral hypersensitivity . Where detailed quantitative histology perform diverticular disease , individual identify lymphocytic infiltration . In circumstance , chronic inflammation sensitises mucosal nerve associate visceral hypersensitivity , something also note symptomatic diverticular disease . Whether anti-inflammatory agent could reverse process yet unknown currently available safe effective treatment inflammatory bowel disease 5 amino-salicylic acid budesonide might well effective allow evaluation role low grade inflammation symptomatic diverticular disease . This study aim investigate inflammatory , neurological symptomatic effect mesalazine diverticular disease .</detailed_description>
