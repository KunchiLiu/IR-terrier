	<detailed_description>Injury skin result physical disruption normal cellular architecture trigger wind healing : process involve inflammation , cell proliferation migration , cell recruitment , angiogenesis extracellular matrix deposition . Growth factor cytokine release inflammatory cell dictate function cell present within wound . There clinical need treatment accelerate healing , current therapy field largely base empirical treatment often ineffective inadequate.Juvidex contains active ingredient mannose-6-phosphate ( M-6-P ) , naturally occur low molecular weight monosaccharide . The propose mechanism action Juvidex antagonistic involves inhibit activation TGF-β1 TGF-β2 . Juvidex develop Renovo therapeutic agent administer accelerate heal acute wound . Technological advance genetics provide scientist tool necessary investigate relationship genetic variation unmanipulated drug-influenced wound heal outcome speed heal . Determining link genetic variation drug response ( pharmacogenomics ) become increasingly important part drug development . For example , Iressa , antagonise tyrosine kinase activity epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) work people specific variation ( polymorphism ) DNA sequence EGFR gene . For Renovo , compare genetic make-up - ( genotype ) - subject respond well respond poorly treatment , well naturally heal faster whose wound heal slowly , may help good define appropriate group patient target give treatment . An additional benefit explore genotype well-defined patient population help improve understand underlie biology wound heal provide new target drug discovery development . Pharmacogenomics may ultimately lead improved treatment wound heal use effective drug safer prescribe regime . In order realise benefit need able collect sample genotyping analysis associate clinical trial . Renovo wish examine DNA sequence patient enrol clinical study order examine variation patient capacity heal wound . This study analyse sample subject participate clinical study RN1004-0082 , double blind , placebo control trial investigate efficacy safety two concentration Juvidex accelerate heal split thickness skin graft donor sit use different dose regime .</detailed_description>
