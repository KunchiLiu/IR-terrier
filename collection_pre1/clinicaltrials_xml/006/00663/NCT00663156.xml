Early report autologous fat transplantation breast successful , increase breast volume modest ( Bircoll , 1987 ) . There also hypothetical concern change breast tissue would interfere mammographic screen breast cancer . Spear et al ( 2005 ) perform autologous fat transplantation reconstruct breast 37 patient 2-dimensional photographic evidence improve breast shape volume suggest technique effectively perform . However , patient receive mastectomy mammographic screen indicate . Coleman Saboeiro ( 2007 ) perform autologous fat transplantation breast 17 patient . Fifteen 17 patient receive post-operative mammogram , 7 ( 47 % ) abnormal . However , none abnormal finding interfere cancer screening . Furthermore , 2 patient study develop breast cancer successfully detect mammography . Other study confirm ability differentiate benign malignant finding mammogram autologous fat transplantation . Pulagam et al ( 2006 ) report long term ( 10 8 year ) find 2 patient underwent autologous fat transplantation breast . Mammography ultrasound use differentiate benign malignant appear calcification . Some author speculate autologous fat transplantation breast would lead mammographic change similar routine breast procedure breast reduction mastopexy ( Coleman Saboeiro , 2007 ) .</detailed_description>
