	<brief_summary>This study investigate effectiveness safety 12 week treatment JNJ-16269110 ( R256918 ) , overweight obese patient . The primary measure effectiveness change body weight clinically relevant dosage level treatment . Additional measure include body mass index ( BMI ) , DEXA ( dual X-ray absorptiometry specialize x-ray test measure body composition ) , fast glucose , lipid level , blood pressure . Safety assessment perform trial include laboratory test , vital sign measurement , adverse event reporting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness JNJ-16269110 ( R256918 ) Overweight Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( assign study drug chance ) , double-blind ( patient investigator know whether patient assign receive study drug placebo ) , placebo-controlled study involve overweight obese patient . Patients randomize one 4 treatment group receive study drug placebo period 12 week . The study consist 3 phase : pretreatment phase ( include screen period 1 week period prior active treatment 4 week ) , treatment period 12 week , posttreatment phase ( consist follow-up visit ) . Standardized nonpharmacologic therapy ( individualized calorie deficit diet contain 30 % calorie fat nutritional counseling ) administer Week 4 follow-up period . During treatment period , patient visit center every two week . On visit , patient come clinic 8 hour fast . For effectiveness assessment , patient weigh BMI calculate visit ; waist hip circumference DEXA measurement ( body composition fat mass analysis ) perform select time point . Additional effectiveness assessment blood sample include level fast hemoglobin type A1c ( HbA1c ) , glucose , cholesterol , triglyceride , insulin , C-peptide , gastrointestinal hormone . Insulin sensitivity pancreas function evaluate . Safety evaluation , include incidence adverse event , clinical laboratory result , vital sign , electrocardiogram , perform study . Patients complete questionnaire related stomach/bowel symptom ( GI ) throughout study . Blood sample also draw analysis subject gene analyse body 's handle study drug . The overall duration study patient approximately 19 week . The study hypothesis treatment JNJ-16269110 ( R256918 ) cause change body weight compare placebo well tolerated overweight obese patient . This hypothesis investigate dosage level determine clinically relevant dose . 5 mg capsule , 10 mg capsule , 15 mg capsule , match placebo capsule take orally .</detailed_description>
