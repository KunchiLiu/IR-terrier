	<brief_title>Aflibercept Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) aflibercept administer intravenously every 14 day child relapse refractory solid tumor . II . To estimate MTD RPTD aflibercept administer intravenously every 21 day patient . III . To define describe toxicity intravenous aflibercept administered 14-day 21-day schedule , respectively . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics intravenous aflibercept patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define , preliminarily , antitumor activity intravenous aflibercept within confines phase I study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . PART 1 : Patients receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive aflibercept maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . PART 2 : Patients receive aflibercept part 1 150 % MTD determine part 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect prior treatment day 1 course 1 , 2 , 5 6 pharmacokinetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
