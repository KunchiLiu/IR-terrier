	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure &amp; Activity During &amp; After Exercise-Induced Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim propose study determine total daily activity thermogenesis ( TDAT ) total daily energy expenditure ( TDEE ) regulate obese human attempt lose weight maintain weight loss exercise . Two exercise intervention compare ; structure aerobic exercise program walking program . EAT verify , NEAT , TDAT , TDEE measure use state-of-the-art technology . Subjects study 6 month intervention period 6 month follow-up period . It hypothesize walk program favorable effect TDAT TDEE intervention follow-up period . If hypothesis correct , data propose study could use improve effectiveness exercise-based weight loss weight loss maintenance program .</detailed_description>
