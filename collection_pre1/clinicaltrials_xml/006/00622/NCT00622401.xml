	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety investigational Dendritic Cell/Tumor Fusion vaccine give IL-12 patient breast cancer . RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Interleukin-12 may stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together interleukin-12 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose interleukin-12 give together vaccine therapy see well work treat woman stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TUMOR COLLECTION : Tumor cell collect participant make study vaccine . Based location tumor , decision make best approach obtain cell . DENDRITIC CELL COLLECTION : Participants undergo procedure know leukapheresis obtain dendritic cell ( procedure may do tumor cell obtain ) . This procedure take 2-4 hour . If enough cell collect , participant may ask return additional leukapheresis procedure . If sufficient number cell obtain , tumor cell dendritic cell fuse ( combine together make one large cell ) together laboratory divide appropriate dose administration . TREATMENT : Treatment consist injection tumor cell fuse dendritic cell skin every 3 week total 9 week . The dose participant receives depend total number fusion cell make . STUDY COHORTS : The first group three participant receive DC/Tumor Fusion study vaccine alone . The next group 3 participant receive DC/Tumor Fusion study vaccine low dose Il-12 . If significant side effect follow group subject treat DC/Tumor Fusion study vaccine high dose Il-12 . PATIENT MONITORING : Participants carefully monitor study period follow test procedure perform : physical exam ( weekly ) ; blood collection ( weekly ) ; DC/Tumor Fusion study vaccine Journal ( participant record side effect medication may take ) ; tumor cell skin test ( first vaccine one month follow last vaccine ) ; skin biopsy site vaccination administration , accessible tumor site , local reaction site .</detailed_description>
