	<brief_summary>The purpose propose randomize , control trial compare effect high monounsaturated fat diet high carbohydrate diet body weight , body composition , glycemic control , plasma lipid , cardiovascular risk factor period one year . At present , study free-living subject perform . The specific aim propose project test hypothesis ( 1 ) high monounsaturated fat diet produce great weight loss/body fat loss successful weight maintenance high carbohydrate diet ( 2 ) high monounsaturated fat diet result improve lipid profile well glycemic control high carbohydrate diet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect High Monounsaturated Fat Diet Glycemic Control Cardiovascular Risk Factors Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence type 2 diabetes increase steadily last three decade . Although medical nutrition therapy integral component diabetes management , nutrition recommendation diabetes often base clinical experience expert consensus , rather carefully control clinical trial . The expert consensus medical nutrition therapy carbohydrate monounsaturated fat together provide approximately 60-70 % total energy intake . This recommendation accommodate party side debate constitutes optimal macronutrient composition diet type 2 diabetic patient . On one side proponent high carbohydrate , low fat diet contend regimen promotes lower total- LDL-cholesterol less calorically dense diet contain high percentage fat . On side advocate high monounsaturated fat , Mediterranean-type diet cite data short-term study indicate approach decrease postprandial level plasma glucose , insulin , triglyceride , increase HDL-cholesterol isocaloric high carbohydrate diet . However , concern potential high fat diet increase energy intake weight gain among free-living subject . To make definitive , scientifically-based diet recommendation , essential control long-term trial conduct demonstrate health effect specific percentage monounsaturated fat carbohydrates diet person type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
