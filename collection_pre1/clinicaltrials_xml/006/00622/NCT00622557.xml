	<brief_title>General Surgical Outcomes Quality Improvement Database ( UH-SOCRATES )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since Institute Medicine report , title `` To Err Human '' , increase trend evaluate outcome healthcare . While optimal outcome delivery healthcare something hospital medical , nursing administrative staff always try achieve , often attempt without much information ass outcomes actually occur . For reason , program NSQIP ( National Surgical Quality Improvement Project ) bring VA system private academic healthcare system , sample surgical outcome provide hospital benchmark achieve , well inform rank overall result . Unfortunately , system NSQIP base sample percentage case perform week , track case provider . Many case therefore track way . Certain center establish database track surgical outcome . These usually specific certain surgical specialty , provide opportunity perform quality improvement . These also add value useful tool maintenance certification clinical research . Primary goal study : We propose develop General Surgical Outcomes Quality Improvement Database ( GSOD ) -subsequently rename UH-SOCRATES-which track surgical , medical , radiological encounter occur University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( UHCMC ) well UH 's Richmond Geauga campuses . This database several goal : 1 . UH-SOCRATES used quality improvement tool analyze process outcome measure , example able evaluate patient prolong length stay case define evaluate specific risk factor in-hospital event . 2 . By use hospital cod CPT code , UH-SOCRATES able accurately track case perform surgeon maintenance certification purpose . All goal relate quality improvement assessment , consider `` human subject research '' 45 CFR 46 . In future hop UH-SOCRATES also powerful resource formal research surgical outcome . Future IRB submission submit purpose . This IRB submission therefore address quality improvement perspective UH-SOCRATES .</detailed_description>
