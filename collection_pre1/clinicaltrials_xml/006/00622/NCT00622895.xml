	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety effectiveness reduce intensity condition regimen allogeneic bone marrow transplant people systemic sclerosis . In allogeneic bone marrow transplant procedure , bone marrow take healthy donor transplant patient . Bone marrow donate family member unrelated donor complete tissue type match . Participants receive chemotherapy low dose radiation condition regimen consist follow : Fludarabine give intravenously 5 day . Cyclophosphamide give intravenously first second day . After complete fludarabine cyclophosphamide , patient receive single low dose total body irradiation . The next day , patient receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant . On third fourth day transplant , patient receive high dose intravenous cyclophosphamide . This give help prevent two complication : ( 1 ) graft rejection , occur body 's immune system reject donor bone marrow , ( 2 ) graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , donor immune cell attack patient 's normal tissue . On fifth day transplant , patient start receive two additional medication : tacrolimus mycophenolic acid ( MPA , Myfortic ) , help prevent GVHD . Patients receive mycophenolic acid 5 week tacrolimus 6 month . Also begin fifth day transplant , patient receive daily injection growth factor call granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , protein increase white blood cell count ; G-CSF continue patient 's white blood cell count return normal level . Patients remain closely monitor either outpatient clinic set hospital approximately 2-3 month transplant , possibly longer complication . Follow-up study visit occur 6 month 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year transplant . Study researcher keep track patient 's medical condition leave transplant center phone call mailing patient doctor year rest study participant ' life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation After Nonmyeloablative Conditioning Patients With Severe Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety potential efficacy reduce intensity condition fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/low-dose total body irradiation ( TBI ) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) stabilization regression disease manifestation severe systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether stable allogeneic donor engraftment safely establish reduced intensity conditioning follow matched sibling unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation patient severe SSc . OUTLINE : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) day -6 , -5 , -4 , -3 -2 Cyclophosphamide IV day -6 , -5 , undergo 2 Gray TBI day -1 . Patients receive human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched donor bone marrow transplantation day 0 . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day +3 +4 , begin day +5 start tacrolimus orally ( PO ) enteric coat mycophenolic acid . After completion initial study treatment , patient follow 6 month annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
