	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Epoetin Alfa 40,000 IU ( International Units ) Every Week 80,000 IU Every Week Compared Placebo Patients With Low Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes Risk Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign chance treatment group ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know treatment receive patient ) , placebo-controlled , multicenter study epoetin alfa anemic patient diagnose myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) accord protocol-specified criterion . Patients meet entry criterion study randomly assign receive epoetin alfa 40,000 IU 80,000 IU matching volume placebo administer subcutaneous ( skin ) injection every week . Doses study drug withheld , decrease , increased basis weekly hemoglobin concentration monitor patient predefined dose adjustment guideline . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) periodically review study data assessment disease progression , independent central reviewer review bone marrow specimens peripheral blood count . Safety monitor throughout study predetermine interval clinically indicate physical examination , laboratory test evaluation adverse event . Patients Treatment Phase randomly assign receive weekly epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) dose 40,000 IU ( 1 mL ) 80,000 IU ( 2ML ) matching volume placebo ( 1 mL 2 mL ) every week 48 week . Patients may continue receive double-blinded treatment 48-weeks .</detailed_description>
