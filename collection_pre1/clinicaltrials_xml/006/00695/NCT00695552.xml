	<brief_summary>This trial investigate biological effect exercise training depression . Participants randomly allocate either aerobic exercise group perform exercise stationary bike group perform low-impact exercise stretching exercise . Both group attend session three time per week 3 month . Before intervention investigator measure severity depression use Hamilton depression rating scale ( HAM-D17 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The yearly incidence depression estimate 3-5 % , lifetime prevalence 17 % western societies.Furthermore , Major depression associate increased mortality somatic disorder cardiovascular disease , stroke , endocrinological disease . WHO others state unipolar depressive disorder lead cause disease burden western world 2002 accounting 9,0 % disability adjust life year . Projecting current development disease pattern unipolar depression expect second high cause global disease burden 2030 . With remission rate approximately 50 % use medical antidepressant therapy , search alternative augmentation therapy key issue depressive research . In 2001 meta-analysis conclude effect exercise training could determine due lack good quality research . The author find majority trial without blind outcome assessment , lack intention-to-treat analysis , short follow-up . In context , one author 2004 launch pragmatic randomized control trial investigate effect exercise training depressive symptom - DEMO trial ( 10 ) . The 165 include participant randomize either aerobic , non-aerobic , relaxation train four-month training programme . The primary outcome Hamilton depression rating scale ( HAM-D17 ) data collection end June 1st 2007 . After four month intervention overall effect exercise depressive symptom ; estimate four month non-aerobic relaxation training -0.9 ( 95 % CI : -3.2 1.4 ) aerobic relaxation train 0.99 ( 95 % CI : -1.3 3.3 ) . These result support biological effect exercise major depression . However , majority ( 115/165 ) patient receive antidepressant medication six week baseline thus lack positive result could partly explain treatment resistant group . A subgroup analysis patient medicate baseline estimate effect non-aerobic relaxation training -1.7 ( 95 % CI : -6.0 2.5 ) aerobic relaxation train 0.3 ( 95 % CI : -3.9 4.6 ) . The number patient important sub-group , mean conclusion non-medicated patient underpowered . In addition literature suggest possible effect exercise depression frequency intensity relate . In DEMO trial participant train twice pr . week . This result DEMO trial somewhat contrast abundant publication animal research show exercise stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis theory improve depressive symptom cognitive skill . The hippocampus involve cognitive function memory learning process well regulation hypothalamus . In depression neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer Parkinson Disease , share feature like impaired memory learn ability , hippocampus characterize atrophia . In addition decrease hippocampal volume , brain imaging study observe reduction volume prefrontal cortex depress patient , though postmortem study less evident result . Prospective study healthy adult suggest exercise beneficial effect cognitive function reduces age relate decline . Research rodent suggest increase memory learn relation exercise mediate up-regulation brain derive neurotrophic factor , ability stimulate synaptic-plasticity . Interestingly exercise induce cell proliferation inhibit peripheral blockade either insulin growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , could indicate exercise induce neurogenesis dependent IGF-I/VEGF . The role IGF-I neurogenesis support study show increase new hippocampal cell sedentary animal give IGF-I infusion . Fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF-2 ) also increase rat hippocampus response exercise , however FGF-2 injection adult rat hippocampus increase neurogenesis . The importance IGF-I neurogenesis emphasize fact homozygous IGF1 -/- mouse age month reduce brain weight affect major brain area , especially volume dentate gyrus ( 33 ) contrary BDNF null mutant mouse show major hippocampal deficit . Furthermore , show antidepressant treatment up-regulates sBDNF human relationship genetic variant BDNF locus depression imply . On background could argue low BDNF level contribute pathophysiology depression , exercise beneficial effect cognitive function patient depression up-regulation IGF-1 , VEGF BDNF . The effect exercise hippocampal neurogenesis cognition recently support human study measure cerebral blood volume dentate gyrus magnetic resonance imaging . On background investigator design randomized trial compare aerobic exercise treatment light moderate depression . This trial employ adequate method reduce bias centralize randomization , blind outcome assessment , analysis accord intent-to-treat principle . In addition investigator plan include healthy control group establish difference biological response exercise Objectives The primary objective DEMOII superiority trial ass beneficial harmful effect aerobic exercise versus stretch exercise patient diagnose moderate depression accord ICD-10 . The primary outcome assessment depressive symptom measure Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAM-D17 ) , outcome assessor blind intervention group . The secondary objective measure effect exercise neurogenesis hippocampal region cerebral blood volume . The assessor blind participation status . Tertiary object evaluate cognitive skill , brain derive neurotrophic factor , insulin like growth hormone 1 , vascular endothelial growth factor , variable associate development cardiovascular disease ( interleukin 6 , maximal oxygen uptake , BMI , tumour necroses factor alpha blood pressure ) .</detailed_description>
