	<brief_title>One-Year Safety Tolerability Study Azilsartan Medoxomil Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one-third patient continue maintain control successfully . Takeda Global Research Development develop TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) treatment essential hypertension . This study conduct demonstrate long-term safety tolerability azilsartan medoxomil individual essential hypertension . Study participation anticipate approximately 1 year 1.5 month , participant require return clinic 10 study visit .</detailed_description>
