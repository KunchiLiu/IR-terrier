	<brief_summary>The pollution operating room environment anesthetic agent question , study document past . These investigation demonstrate existence teratogenic effect animal possibility decrease mental performance , reduce fertility , fetal loss , spontaneous abortion addictive potential human chronic exposure trace amount anesthetic agent . These finding lead establishment exposure limit industry standard consumer protection agency , National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) . However , standard apply inhalation anesthetic agent excreted lung patient expiration . These concern operate room pollution wean away introduction intravenous anesthetic agent , propofol , believe propofol excrete system lung . Recent research point contrary demonstrates excretion propofol vapor expire gas patient . Furthermore , animal experiment laboratory establish existence biological mechanism responsible addiction animal expose trace amount propofol . We propose study exposure level anesthesia care provider operate room , propofol use , standardized condition . Our finding help establish preventive measure propofol addiction anesthesia care provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propofol Concentration In The Ambient Air Of The Operating Room And In The Blood Of Anesthesia Care Providers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical project carry operating room University Hospital Doctors Office Center . The study do routine surgery laryngeal mask airway use maintain airway general anesthesia 20 adult patient American Society Anesthesiologists physical status I II . Routine anesthetic care standard apply intravenous line placement monitoring patient . General anesthesia induce bolus dose propofol ( 2mg.kg-1 ) maintain intravenous infusion propofol ( 100-200 mcg.kg-1.min-1 ) . Patients allow breathe spontaneously 40 % oxygen air . Adjuvant intravenous medication give amnesia , analgesia infection prophylaxis per routine anesthetic practice . The ambient propofol concentration measure , use proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer ( PTR-MS ) , distance 25cm patient 's face . The measurement ambient propofol concentration begin administration propofol patient continue till patient leave operate room . The use PTR-MS device interfere anesthetic management patient . In unforeseen circumstance , anesthesiologist determines use PTR-MS interfere anesthetic care patient , device immediately remove measurement ambient propofol concentration suspend case . The set-up usage PTR-MS perform research team take part clinical management patient . The PTR-MS device depend proton transfer reaction quantify , part per billion ( ppb ) volume , volatile organic compound air extremely low concentration real time . The mean peak ambient propofol concentration determine case time weight average ( TWA ) calculate eight-hour period end study . In addition , receive write informed consent anesthesia care provider , blood sample draw propofol concentration measure high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) within 24hr . The blood sample constitute 3ml two occasion , one early morning anesthesia care start one eight hour anesthesia care . HPLC device use spectrofluorometric detector estimate trace amount propofol blood ng.ml-1 . The blood estimation propofol also conduct research team take part clinical management patient .</detailed_description>
