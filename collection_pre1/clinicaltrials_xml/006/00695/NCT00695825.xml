	<brief_summary>Recent population study show glycemic index ( GI ) food product positively associate risk develop type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In pathogenesis type 2 diabetes CVD , inflammatory process play pivotal role . In previous intervention study ( 11 week ) , however , found effect lower-GI vs. higher-GI diet fast inflammatory marker subject increase risk develop metabolic syndrome . People , however , spent time postprandial period . Therefore , need study postprandial effect low-GI vs. high-GI diet . In addition , need emphasized GI derive study lean subject , especially overweight obese people suffer metabolic aberration relate development type 2 diabetes CVD . AIM : To investigate obese subject postprandial effect low-GI vs. high-GI food product metabolic risk marker . A second research objective compare effect lean subject .</brief_summary>
