	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Talent Endoluminal Spring Graft System , investigational device , treat abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . The treatment population include patient abdominal aortic aneurysm meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . All patient treatment population undergo post-procedure follow-up evaluation one ( 1 ) , six ( 6 ) , 12 month annually thereafter five ( 5 ) year post-procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) offer certain advantage compare surgical repair abdominal aortic aneurysm . Known benefit associate EVAR , describe scientific literature , include minimally invasive procedure , short ICU hospital stay , reduce blood loss , rapid recovery , reduce need general anesthesia . Potential benefit may associate use Talent device include reduce occurrence endoleaks , therefore reduced subsequent re-interventions . The risks/complications know occur patient undergo AAA repair may include anesthetic complication , ( e.g. , aspiration ) , aneurysm enlargement , rupture , perforation dissection , bleeding , arterial venous thrombosis and/or pseudoaneurysm , arteriovenous fistula , hematoma coagulopathy , bowel complication , cardiac complication , ( e.g. , arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , hypotension , hypertension ) , embolization ( micro macro ) transient permanent ischemia infarction , genitourinary complication , infection , neurologic complication , occlusion device native vessel , pulmonary/respiratory complication renal complication .</detailed_description>
