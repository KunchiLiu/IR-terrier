	<brief_summary>Injections medicine middle eye ( intravitreal injection ) commonly use multitude retinal disease . We look new treatment may beneficial treat retinal disease improve patient ' vision . Infliximab ( Remicade ) genetically engineer antibody molecule body call TNF-α . It neutralize effect TNF-α binding . Intravenous Infliximab use inflammatory arthritic condition Crohn 's disease since 1998 . We know infliximab injection eye safe . We perform pilot study determine safe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravenous Infliximab currently use treatment systemic inflammatory condition inflammatory disease eye relatively favorable safety profile . However , systemic administration carry risk systemic side effect , case infliximab severe , increased risk infection , reactivation tuberculosis Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma . Direct intravitreal administration medication prefer method treatment retinal vascular disorder . The eye self contain organ relatively isolated systemic circulation tight blood retinal barrier . Effective intraocular drug level achieve much small amount medication inject intravitreally also result minimal systemic exposure patient . Preliminary study show Infliximab may positive role management retinal vascular disorder human administer intravenously , effective treatment intravitreally animal model . No data publish yet intravitreal use infliximab human subject . We plan study safety tolerability intravitreal injection infliximab human subject refractory diabetic macular edema choroidal neovascularization . Our infliximab dose 0.5mg/0.5ml , follow reconstitution instruction Product Insert . This dose fall within therapeutic dosing find within animal study lead vitreous concentration the7.5 µg dose group B rat eye study . ( 4 )</detailed_description>
