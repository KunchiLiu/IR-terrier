	<brief_summary>The aim study : 1. compare toxicity profile efficacy gemcitabine/carboplatin docetaxel East Asian Caucasian patient . 2. determine genotype distribution gene involve docetaxel gemcitabine pathway East Asian Caucasian patient . 3. evaluate association genotypes 1. treatment toxicity 2. treatment efficacy 3. pharmacokinetics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Docetaxel Gemcitabine-based Chemotherapy East Asian Caucasian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Germline polymorphism inherit genetic variation present cell body . Mounting evidence show genetic polymorphism drug metabolizing , transporter target gene major determinant response drug . The aim study compare ( ) toxicity profile efficacy gemcitabine/carboplatin docetaxel , ( ii ) distribution gene involve docetaxel gemcitabine pathway ( iii ) evaluate association pharmacogenetics , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics East Asian Caucasian patient . To date , pharmacogenetic strategy predominantly focus role single gene , regulation drug metabolism . However , clear evidence treatment outcome control network gene , contribute patient 's phenotype . In study , propose take global approach include relevant candidate gene drug pathway evaluate effect polymorphism treatment outcomes . We select two commonly use chemotherapy regimen base previous observation interethnic variability treatment outcomes candidate polymorphism . By incorporate pharmacokinetic ( drug level , drug elimination etc ) , pharmacodynamic ( treatment response , survival etc ) pharmacogenetic approach clinical trial , would enhance understanding inter-individual variability response toxicity drug treatment , first step towards individualize drug treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm ) AJCC/UICC stage IIIB IV non small cell lung cancer stage IV breast cancer docetaxel indicate . ii ) AJCC/UICC stage IIIB stage IV non small cell lung cancer gemcitabine/carboplatin indicate . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; =20 mm conventional technique &gt; =10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 11.2 evaluation measurable disease . Eligible patient must previous anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy , investigational therapy least 4 week study entry ( 6 week prior therapy include nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy , chemotherapy give concurrently radiotherapy non metastatic disease , allow last dose last dose give 6 month study entry . Patients eligible docetaxel receive least one prior line palliative chemotherapy . Patients eligible gemcitabine/carboplatin prior palliative therapy . Age &gt; =18 year . Life expectancy great 8 week . ECOG performance status &lt; =2 ( Karnofsky &gt; =60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; =3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1,500/mcL platelet &gt; =100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; =2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; =60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients rapidly progress brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis . Furthermore often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel gemcitabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study docetaxel gemcitabine embryotoxic/fetotoxic potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother docetaxel gemcitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated docetaxel gemcitabine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
