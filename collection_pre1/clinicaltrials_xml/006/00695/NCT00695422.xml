	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine various pharmacotherapeutic agent investigated primary AIDS Malignancy Clinical Trials ( AMC ) diseases human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -associated neoplasia preliminary evidence activity anogenital HPV infection anogenital squamous intraepithelial lesion ( ASIL ) HIV-positive patient participate trial . - To describe change type anal HPV present prevalence ASIL patient treat study . - To evaluate cervical HPV infection cervical/vulvovaginal disease HIV-positive woman participate trial . - To describe change cervical HPV infection cervical/vulvovaginal disease woman undergo various study treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo anal swab collection baseline obtain sample anal cytology , anal human papillomavirus ( HPV ) typing , HPV-related testing ( e.g. , HPV viral load ) . Digital rectal examination ( DRE ) also perform part baseline physical examination . Female patient also undergo cervical swab collection cervical HPV test cytology , well colposcopy ( available ) cervix vulvovaginal region completely assess low genital tract HPV-related lesion . At site high-resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) available , patient encourage , require , HRA biopsy visualize lesion within 30 day collection swab . After baseline assessment , patient undergo treatment investigative agent accord study protocol requirement . If study treatment continue beyond 6 month , additional anal cervical swab obtain anal cervical HPV cytology along DREs every 6 month completion study treatment final study visit . Patients may also undergo additional HRA biopsy and/or colposcopy low genital tract biopsy ( woman ) time . Patients abnormal anal cytology histology refer HRA per local standard care . If HRA available treatment site , patient undergo DRE , abnormal DRE refer evaluation surgeon .</detailed_description>
