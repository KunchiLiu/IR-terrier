	<brief_summary>Study Objectives : - 1 . To examine extent noise typical nurse unit reduces speech intelligibility acutely ill hospitalize patient - 2 . To examine extent noise typical nurse unit impair recall acutely ill hospitalize patient - 3 . To quantify severity reduce performance associate age , familiarity healthcare set , hear health status . Plan : One hundred twenty inpatient four medical/surgical nurse unit Portland VA Medical Center , 60 normal hear 60 hearing impairment recruit participate study . Following assessment ascertain eligibility obtain informed consent , patient test sound booth housed National Center Rehabilitative Auditory Research ( NCRAR ) . Designed patient serf control , accommodate considerable baseline variability patient without adversely affect require sample size . Patients ' performance speech intelligibility recall test measure use constant level speech , control environment noise ( baseline ) , white noise , hospital noise hospital noise speech , deliver via headphone pseudo-random order . Performance measure type noise decibel level equivalent currently experience nurse unit low level prior study show conducive effective communication By select measure particularly relevant safe care hospitalize patient , study extensively healthy population highly control condition , expect find compelling unambiguous evidence hospitalize patient correctly hear recall little say hospitalization . The majority hospitalize patient stay acute care nurse unit hospitalization , make appropriate population study context response noise typical environment . Perhaps importantly , study heighten awareness health-care personnel level impairment suffer patient - ability correctly interpret speech recall - typical noisy environment nurse unit .</brief_summary>
