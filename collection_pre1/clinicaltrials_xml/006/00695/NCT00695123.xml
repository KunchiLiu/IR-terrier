	<brief_summary>This study determine eligibility participation research study blood disorder conduct National Heart , Lung Blood Institute National Institute Diabetes , Digestive , Kidney Diseases . Healthy volunteer , patient blood disorder study NHLBI NIDDK potential stem cell donor patient blood disorder 8 year age old may eligible screen protocol . ( Healthy volunteer qualify research protocol would serve control subject . ) Participants undergo follow test procedure : Healthy Volunteers - Medical history , physical examination , blood test urine sample collection . - Buccal mucosa sample collection . ( Cells collect inside cheek gentle scrap bristly brush . ) - Bone marrow aspiration ( volunteer 18 year age old ) . Potential Stem Cell Donor -Same healthy volunteer plus evaluation may include electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , image study ( X-rays , CT scan , MRI scan others ) , heart evaluation , lung function test . Patient Blood Disorder -Same stem cell donor plus additional evaluation treatment may include radiation oncology evaluation , catheter placement , blood transfusion , kidney liver biopsy . Short course drug treatment induction fetal hemoglobin sickle cell patient , and/or iron chelation patient receive chronic red cell transfusion may include well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study allow evaluation subject order determine ability safely participate active NIH research study study blood disorder . This protocol serve several purpose : 1 ) allow detailed investigation blood disorder subject , status organ system would determine ability safely tolerate specific aspect active research protocol ; 2 ) allow investigator offer clinical diagnostic testing procedure patient treatment facilitate participation clinical trial ; 3 ) allow investigation whether donor HLA match , fit receive G-CSF , fit undergo apheresis therefore eligible participate donor bone marrow transplant protocol ; 4 ) allow evaluation healthy volunteer whether eligible participation control subject protocols require generally good health status history physical exam finding , laboratory assessment ; 5 ) allow collection storage research specimens sample obtainable minimal risk development validation novel clinical tool approach disease . After completion screen process , subject either offer chance participate active research protocol , appropriate protocol identify , subject blood disorder recommendation treatment option relay and/or primary refer physician .</detailed_description>
