	<brief_summary>During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation spinal cord injure men increase pressure observed external urethral sphincter along increase bladder capacity . In subsequent study demonstrate TMNS woman could induce pressure increment external urethral sphincter . A pilot study since show 6 week stimulation 24 33 woman suffer urinary stress incontinence able contract pelvic floor muscle become free symptom . Another pilot study show promising effect overactive bladder syndrome . The present study aim treat urinary incontinence include 3 group patient 40 patient group : Women suffer urinary stress incontinence , woman suffer urge incontinence men suffer urinary incontinence prostatectomy . A medical vibrator use group subject randomize active treatment placebo treatment . In woman stimulation perform perineum every day 6 week amplitude 2 mm frequency 100 Hz . In men vibration parameter/location determine result pressure profile study also include . Results evaluate basis questionnaire , micturition diary diaper test . If able demonstrate significant reduction incontinence symptom subject ass vibration way reestablish normal function pelvic floor muscle bladder function incontinent patient .</brief_summary>
