	<brief_summary>This study determine whether varenicline , drug act brain 's nicotine receptor use help smoker stop smoking , impact alcohol self-administration . People 24 60 year age regularly consume alcoholic drink ( 15 drink per week woman , 20 drink per week men ) may eligible study . The study require five outpatient visit one overnight hospital admission NIH Clinical Center . Participants undergo follow procedure : Visit 1 ( outpatient : 4-5 hour ) - Standard assessment , include vital sign measurement , breathalyzer test , blood urine test ( include pregnancy test female ) , questionnaires mood , symptom , alcohol use smoking , applicable - Questionnaires medical psychological status - Health assessment assessment alcohol drink behavior Visit 2 ( outpatient : 8 hour ) - Standard assessment ( see ) - Computer-Assisted Self-infusion Ethanol ( CASE ) session : Subjects receive prim intravenous infusion alcohol . After 25 min , allow give additional exposure alcohol period 2 hour press button computer control infusion pump . Visit 3 ( outpatient : 2 hour ) -Standard assessment Visit 4 ( outpatient : 8 hour ) - Standard assessment - Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRI ) . This test use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The patient lie table slide scanner , wear earplug muffle loud sound occur scan process . Initial picture take brain 's structure additional scan measure brain activity subject performs simple task . - Alcohol Infusion . Subjects receive intravenous infusion alcohol MRI scanner measure brain response alcohol . Visit 5 ( overnight ) - Standard assessment - Repeat CASE session - Interview subject 's experience participate protocol , include symptom urges drink Visit 6 ( outpatient ) - Standard assessment ( without blood test ) - Interview participation study Telephone follow-up After 3 week , subject call check symptom gather information drinking , applicable , smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Varenicline Reduce Alcohol Consumption Heavy Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Considerable clinical experimental evidence human animal model link nicotine use heavy alcohol consumption . Varenicline , alpha4beta2 ( nicotinic ) acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) partial agonist , oral medication approve FDA ( 2006 ) smoke cessation . Recently , show reduce alcohol consumption rodent model alcohol dependence . In present short-term experimental study , assess primarily ability reduce alcohol self-administration heavy drinker . Secondarily , effect alcohol urge ( craving ) , well smoke parameter measure . In addition , effect varenicline incentive motivation alcohol underlie brain reward system activation , well activation brain reward system response intravenously administer alcohol measure . Study Population : Fifty healthy , adult ( smoker non-smokers ) , age 21 60 year , study . Individuals must drink alcohol regularly heavy level , average great 20 drink per week men , great 15 drink per week woman , seek help alcohol-related problem . Design : Following protocol screen medical evaluation , qualified subject undergo initial ( pre-study drug ) intravenous alcohol self-administration session ( hereafter , call computer-assisted self-infusion ethanol , CASE ) . Following , subject randomize varenicline placebo . Subjects clinically evaluate three occasion study drug : one week study medication ; , prior fMRI ; , end treatment , undergo second ( on-study drug ) CASE session . Between day 13 21 , subject schedule undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain perform task design evaluate incentive salience alcohol cue well pharmacological effect alcohol . Thereafter , subject receive two course counsel heavy drinking , use motivational enhancement technique , aim enhance readiness behavioral change seek treatment , need . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome peak breath alcohol exposure achieve on-study drug CASE session . Secondary outcome study drug phase include measure alcohol consumption , urge drink , well alcohol craving effect on-study drug CASE session . Additionally , fMRI BOLD responses ventral striatum , area involve brain reward circuitry show activated acute IV alcohol administration well anticipation work reward measure . In smoker , cigarette use quite rate well urge smoke nicotine withdrawal also measure . Safety tolerability follow course take study drug symptom checklist , profile mood anxiety clinical interview . Serum varenicline concentration also measure assess compliance control potential pharmacokinetic variation .</detailed_description>
