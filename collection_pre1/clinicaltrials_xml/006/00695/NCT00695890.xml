	<detailed_description>Postoperative visual loss result surgical procedure perform eye devastate outcome patient poorly understood medical community . It potentially preventable complication . Diminished blood supply optic nerve , affect anterior posterior portion optic nerve , common cause postoperative visual loss . Other , less common cause include occlusion retinal artery vein , retinal embolism cortical blindness . The incidence postoperative visual loss increase patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass prone spine surgery . Although etiology post-operative visual loss unknown , thought multifactorial , several potential risk factor identify , include degree low blood pressure , preoperative hematocrit , external compression eye , amount blood loss , prolonged duration surgical time increase pressure eye associate positioning . To date study focus mechanism associate visual loss . We would like focus feasibility use monitor may signal loss visual function intraoperatively .</detailed_description>
