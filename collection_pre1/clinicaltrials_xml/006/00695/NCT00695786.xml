	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn revlimid ( lenalidomide ) combination rituximab previously untreated indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma control disease . The safety combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Rituximab type drug know monoclonal antibody . It design act CD20 antigen find surface normal B lymphocytes malignant lymphoma cell . When rituximab attack CD20 antigen , may kill lymphoma cell . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide mouth Days 1-21 28-day study cycle schedule `` A '' , Days 2-22 schedule `` B '' . You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole , water , time day . Do break , chew open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( take double regular dose make miss dose ) . Lenalidomide provide special distribution program call RevAssist速 . A company call Biologics directly mail supply lenalidomide home . The RevAssist速 toll-free contact number patient 1-888-423-5436 . You contact number order ask information properly dispose unused supply lenalidomide ship drug back . You receive rituximab needle vein Day 1 ( Schedule A ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 ( Schedule B ) 4-8 hour . You receive rituximab Day 1 subsequent cycle . You give diary record take study drug problem illness may experience . You also write diary drug take study . Study Visits : After begin treatment , study visit begin cycle . If doctor think necessary , check-up visit may take place often . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask question felt since last visit . - You ask drug take since last visit . - You bring diary give earlier visit . - Blood ( 8 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test check status disease . On Days 8 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 14 Cycles 2-12 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At end 28-day treatment cycle , visit study doctor see safe continue study make sure cancer gotten bad . At visit , blood ( 8 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test check status disease . If doctor think necessary , study visit may bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , x-rays , CT scan , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , gastrointestinal endoscopy check status disease . Pregnancy Tests : Women able become pregnant regular menstrual cycle must agree pregnancy test weekly first 28 day study every 28 day study , end-of-study visit , Day 28 follow discontinuation study . Women irregular menstrual cycle must pregnancy test weekly first 28 day , every 14 day study , end-of-study visit , day 14 28 follow discontinuation study . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 12 cycle . You take study earl disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : Once off-study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask question felt since last visit . - You ask drug take since last visit . - Blood ( around 3 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test check status disease . - You bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - You x-ray CT scan check status disease . - You return unused lenalidomide capsule . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-study visit , contact phone every 6 month check health information cancer treatment may receive . You CT scan neck , thorax , abdomen pelvis every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month follow year , 1 time year . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome . Its use patient indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma investigational . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , include indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Up 155 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
