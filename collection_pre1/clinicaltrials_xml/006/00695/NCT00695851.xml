	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether give drug call PCK3145 reduce level protein blood call MMP-9 well find long drug remain system time . This drug test previously prostate cancer patient abroad show safe minimal side effect . However , know whether change MMP-9 level correlate tumor shrinkage symptom improvement . We would also like evaluate potential pain relief ( analgesic ) effect PCK3145 15mg/m² i.v . weekly 12 week patient symptomatic asymptomatic castrate metastatic prostate cancer dependent opioid analgesic . We would also like monitor pain brief pain questionaire , determine impact marker bone turnover .</brief_summary>
