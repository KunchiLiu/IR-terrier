	<brief_summary>The aim study find Rituximab , antibody specific white cell involve rejection , combine standard anti-rejection treatment effectively reverse rejection process . Our hypothesis acute rejection activation B cell subsequent development anti-donor antibody ultimately lead graft loss . More effective therapy target B cell may abort development anti-HLA antibody , prevent renal injury favorable effect long-term graft outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Rituximab Development Anti-Donor Antibodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two center , randomize pilot study effect Rituximab treatment acute rejection . A total 24 patient ( include patient transplanted University California San Francisco University Alabama Birmingham ) enrol study , 16 randomize Rituximab 8 no-Rituximab ( control arm ) . Fifteen ( 15 ) subject recruit UCSF 10 patient randomize Rituximab 5 no-Rituximab ( control arm ) . If either center slow enroller patient mix could alter . Procedures : This open label trial patient rejection B cell infiltrate kidney biopsy randomize either receive Rituximab Rituximab 2:1 ratio . Patients rejection kidney biopsy immunohistochemistry evidence B cell infiltration enrol study randomize 2:1 receive Rituximab Rituximab . Rituximab administer 2 dos 1,000 mg . The first dose administer patient still hospital treated rejection second dose administer 2 week later outpatient facility GCRC UCSF . The patient ' acute rejection episode treat accord standard therapy per treat transplant physician . Below table ( table 1 ) detail patient blood drawn flow cytometry , anti-HLA antibody , PK study , serum creatinine well 24 hour urine protein . At 3 month enrollment study , patient undergo follow-up biopsy determine extent resolution cellular infiltrate .</detailed_description>
