	<brief_summary>Background : Autism complex developmental disorder involve difficulty verbal nonverbal communication , social-emotional functioning , markedly restricted interest activity . Strong evidence research conduct family member child autism support role genetic factor etiology . Thus , family member characterize broad autism phenotype ( BAP ) involve clinical picture milder qualitatively similar difficulty . Working hypothesis aim : Researchers recently initiate prospective longitudinal study investigate early developmental profile young sibling child autism ( SIBS-A ) . Such longitudinal SIBS-A study currently conduct Hebrew University include old sibling study date . Our main aim identify sibling manifest autism BAP characteristic . Methods : Two group , SIBS-A ( n = 42 ) sibling child typical development ( SIBS-TD , n = 62 ) , see age 4 , 14 , 24 , 36 , 54 month 7 year . We plan continue investigation age 10 year , time school related ability social/emotional competence consolidated investigate developmental trajectory child 's ability age 4 month 10 year use growth curve analysis . Expected result : We expect compare SIBS-TD , significantly 10-year-old SIBS-A display difficulty relate ASD BAP related difficulty . We also expect identify different pattern stability and/or change development child 's ability age 4 month 10 year , two group . Importance : This study provide useful approach examination main research hypothesis regard development SIBS-A . One main advantage use growth curve analysis identification early predictive marker future development . Probable implication Medicine : This research significant implication early identification search cause autism BAP , well implementation early treatment prevention program . By highlight expression ASD BAP sibling , may identify early clinically predictive behavioral marker associate onset contribute investigation underlie genetics mechanism .</brief_summary>
