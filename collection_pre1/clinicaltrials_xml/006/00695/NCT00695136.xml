	<brief_summary>This study test whether donepezil ( Aricept ( Registered Trademark ) ) , drug approve Food Drug Administration treat Alzheimer 's disease , increase rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep child autism autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Some child autism ASD spend little time REM sleep . In study , decrease REM sleep associate learn behavior problem . Donepezil increase REM sleep adult different disorder . If increase REM sleep child study , might able used future study see help learn behavior problem child autism ASD . Children 2 10 year age autism ASD whose percentage REM sleep time well average child age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , blood test , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) sleep study . The sleep study require overnight stay NIH Clinical Center child monitor electrode EEG heartbeat recording , tube tap nose measure airflow , probe finger record oxygen level small watch-like machine wrist record movement . Participating child may require six overnight stay sleep study Clinical Center . The child start take 1.25 mg donepezil 2 4 week . Then admit NIH Clinical Center sleep study , blood test EKG . Those whose REM sleep increase normal level stay 1.25 mg donepezil 8 week , admit Clinical Center final physical examination , blood draw sleep study . That end participation study . Children whose REM sleep increase normal 1.25 mg donepezil give high dose ( 2.5 mg ) 2 4 week , procedure repeat . Those whose REM sleep increase normal 2.5 mg donepezil take 5 mg drug 2 4 week , procedure repeat . Children whose REM sleep increase normal 5 mg donepezil stop medication end participation study . At study visit , study researcher talk parent examine child determine donepezil affect child 's behavior child hav ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder define aberrant development communication socialization presence restrictive and/or repetitive behavior . Recent epidemiologic study document increase number child identify autism spectrum disorder past decade accord , current number indicate prevalence 1 per 150 ( CDC , MMWR 2007 , Feb 9th release ) . Despite press need identify causal factor , etiology remain elusive . Furthermore , heterogeneity presentation complicate attempt locate autism 's home brain . Polysomnography reliable non-invasive tool use study basic pathophysiological mechanism autism developmental neuropsychiatric disability . Our preliminary data young child autism support grow body literature demonstrate sleep architecture abnormal disorder . Previous study child autism identify various abnormality REM sleep include following : immature organization , decrease quantity , abnormal twitch , undifferentiated sleep REM sleep behavior disorder characterize absence muscle atonia normal REM sleep result act dream phenomenon ( Tanguay et al , .1976 , Elia et al. , 2000 , Diomedi et al . 1999 , Thirumalai et al. , 2002 ) . Our cohort spend abnormally short time REM sleep stage sleep compare total sleep time ( hereafter refer SPT REM % REM sleep percent sleep period time ) , prolonged latency REM sleep . The function REM sleep relationship cognition overall neurological health unknown subject ongoing research . We know animal study REM sleep increase intensive learning session . These laboratory finding form basis hypothesis sleep stage important cognitive process REM sleep may useful indicator brain plasticity . Current study continue add support idea . REM sleep recently implicate process human memory consolidation several study suggest crucial normal cognitive function process emotion memory system . Acetylcholine ( Ach ) one major neurotransmitter necessary normal sleep transition abnormality Ach implicate REM deficient sleep population , notably Alzheimer 's disease . This proposal 6 20 week , single arm , open-label study evaluate ability donepezil hydrochloride enhance REM sleep child autism spectrum disorder find low SPT REM % ( define 2 standard deviation observe normative data age ) . All patient come screen protocol 06-M-0065 . Those meet research diagnosis autism spectrum disorder age 2 11 ( tenth year ) evaluate inclusion/exclusion criterion study . The primary outcome measure protocol increase SPT REM % child autism REM/non-REM ratio begin approach normative value . Donepezil enhance REM sleep achieve young healthy adult , elderly , healthy adult elderly , demented adult Alzeheimer 's disease . Furthermore , study Alzheimer disease Mizuno et al show positive correlation improve cognition increase SPT REM % . If REM sleep necessary normal cognition , deficiency absence remedied pharmacologic intervention , may follow improvement REM sleep correlate improve short long term cognition child autism . Donepezil enhance REM sleep document child . Polysomnography provide non-invasive tool ass effect enhance cholinergic tone abnormal sleep architecture document pediatric , autistic population .</detailed_description>
