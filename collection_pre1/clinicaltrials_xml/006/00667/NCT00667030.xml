	<brief_summary>Over half adults country overweight . This increase risk heart blood pressure problem , cancer , stroke arthritis . While difficult lose large amount weight keep , even small amount weight loss improve health . Furthermore , fat increasingly recognize source substance increase inflammation . It may adverse consequence overweight due increase inflammation . We ask volunteer research study may lose moderate amount weight increase activity . It important read understand information form . The purpose study determine influence ( ) age body composition production inflammatory chemical fat ( adipose tissue ) , mechanisms controlling , weight loss aerobic exercise intervention result decrease inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue increasingly recognize inert depot serve accept store excess energy form triglyceride , also secrete hormone adipokines substantial effect lipid glucose metabolism . Furthermore , depot difference metabolic function , well adipokine content . However , physiology underlie consequential observation remain unknown . This research therefore design examine : 1 ) effect age obesity regional adipokine secretion expression , 2 ) whether elevate adipokine level older obese people due increase macrophage infiltration subcutaneous adipose tissue and/or related total , subcutaneous visceral abdominal fat ( SAT VAT ) distribution , 3 ) relationship adipokines insulin resistance constituent metabolic syndrome . Specifically , aim determine : 1. expression secretion ) inflammatory marker SAA , IL-6 , TNF-a , MCP-1 great , b ) anti-inflammatory hormone adiponectin lower SC abdominal gluteal adipose tissue older , compare middle-aged young obese subject across narrow range obesity waist circumference ; 2. age-associated change adipokine production ) due degree macrophage infiltration regional adipose tissue , and/or difference great degree visceral and/or difference ABD fat distribution ( SAT , VAT ) , b ) relate glucose lipid metabolic profile subject ; 3. effect WL+AEX intervention regional adipokine expression secretion , circulate level CRP adipokines , glucose lipid metabolism subset obese sedentary individual great two component metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
