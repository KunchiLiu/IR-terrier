	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety investigational radioisotope Radium-223 , Xofigo ( Alpharadin ) , treatment men prostate cancer bone metastases long respond hormonal treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAY88-8223 , Does Response Study HRPC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design investigate whether dose-response relationship radium-223 patient painful bone metastasis secondary prostate carcinoma regard palliation bone pain . The palliative efficacy establish assessment bone pain consumption analgesia . Furthermore , aim find efficient dose acceptable safety profile . The safety assess measurement adverse event , acute haematological toxicity study period . Long-term chronic toxicity , overall survival one two year post treatment also assess . This double-blind , dose-response , randomize , multi-centre phase II efficacy safety study radium- 223 . The clinical site enroll total 100 eligible patient . The treatment single intravenous administration radium-223 . The target population patient suffer bone pain due skeletal metastasis secondary hormone refractory prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
