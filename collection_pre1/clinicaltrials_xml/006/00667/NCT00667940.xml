	<brief_title>Faculty Development Improve Mini-CEX Ratings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : An intervention training faculty preceptor use mini-CEX improve inter-rater reliability classification accuracy . Methods . We develop faculty development workshop aim improve inter-rater reliability accuracy mini-CEX score . To evaluate workshop conduct randomize , control trial . Preceptors randomly assign immediate delay workshop . The primary outcome inter-rater reliability mini-CEX score preceptor rate videotape resident-patient encounter four week workshop . We also evaluate accuracy performance classification . We also collect mini-CEX rating actual resident-patient interaction one year precede one year follow workshop , calculate interrater reliability . Statistical method . Inter-rater reliability determine use intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) correspond confidence interval . ICC use determine chance-corrected agreement ( accuracy ) . Discrimination ( difference mean score among scripted level performance ) also evaluate measure accuracy . Scientific basis . Clinical performance assessment constitute key element resident education . The effect rater train inter-rater reliability mini-CEX score unknown . This workshop utilize method ( rater error field reference training ) show effective improve rater accuracy non-medical field . Inclusion criterion . All internal medicine residency continuity clinic preceptor eligible .</detailed_description>
