	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether woman overactive bladder ( OAB ) receive direct instillation via catheter Botulinum-A Toxin ( Botox ) Dimethyl Sulfoxide ( DMSO ) solution experience significantly well improvement OAB symptom compare similar group woman OAB receive instillation DMSO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Over Active Bladder Instillation Study - Botox</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy catheter-based instillation solution Botox/DMSO novel method treat woman overactive bladder ( OAB ) secondary urinary incontinence fail oral pharmacologic therapy . This study test broad hypothesis administration Botox/DMSO instillation bladder urethral catheter significantly improve symptom quality life patient OAB compare DMSO installation alone . Explicitly , hypothesize score validate Incontinence Quality Life ( I-QOL ) questionnaire woman OAB receive Botox/DMSO instillation much improve three-month follow-up compare similar woman receive DMSO instillation alone . Our long-term goal offer woman detrusor hyperreflexia OAB less invasive alternative surgery alternative anticholinergic mouth medication . In support effort , propose randomize , double-blind , placebo control clinical trial conduct Department Urology Mayo Clinic , Jacksonville , Florida . Note : The study terminate early July 2011 due extend medical absence Principal Investigator .</detailed_description>
