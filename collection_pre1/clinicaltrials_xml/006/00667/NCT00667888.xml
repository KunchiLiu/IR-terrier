	<brief_title>A Phase III Intensity Radiotherapy Dose Escalation Prostate Cancer Using Hypofractionation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients study randomly pick ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . There equal chance either group . Patients Group 1 treat intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . These patient receive 42 treatment , 5 day per week , 8.5 week . This method become standard treatment M.D . Anderson Cancer Center . Patients Group 2 also treat IMRT . However , patient receive 30 treatment , 5 day per week , 6 week . The dose per day Group 2 patient high Group 1 possibility kill tumor cell . Each external beam treatment require 10-20 minute . However , patient expect spend 20 - 30 minute treatment table imaging measurement prostate position do treatment . The total time radiation department treatment day hour . After radiotherapy complete , patient PSA blood test every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month Years 3 - 5 , annually . They examine every 6 month first 2 year begin 3 month completion treatment , annually . A needle biopsy prostate perform test suggest recurrence . This investigational study . 225 patient take part study . This study take place M. D. Anderson possibly affiliate hospital .</detailed_description>
