	<brief_summary>This study determine whether naltrexone , medicine use treat alcoholism , lessen crave alcohol alcohol withdrawal examine drug affect brain activity alcohol infusion . People 21 50 year age right-handed , alcohol-dependent , least one family member history alcoholism , may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 1 month follow procedure : Screening - Medical history , alcohol-use history family history alcoholism - Physical examination , psychological test blood test - Medicine lessen alcohol withdrawal symptom , necessary Days 1-7 - Alcohol detoxification - Medical psychological evaluation - Assignment naltrexone placebo group Days 7 28 - Drug treatment : Take naltrexone placebo capsule every morning - Additional alcohol-dependence treatment : Cognitive behavioral therapy participation self-help group , Alcoholics Anonymous - Weekly questionnaire measure mood desire alcohol - Blood test - Alcohol crave stimulation test ( day 7 ) : Subjects handle sniff water favorite alcoholic beverage . They rate urge drink alcohol level anxiety heart rate measure . - Alcohol infusion test ( day 9 ) : Subjects MRI scan infusion vein saline ( salt water ) , follow infusion alcohol . For test , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm , one administer saline alcohol ; draw blood sample measure blood alcohol level body chemistry . Before , infusion , subject ask respond question feeling , craving mood change . Follow-up Subjects ask participate 3-month outpatient assessment program involve five outpatient visit ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 week discharge ) . At visit , fill questionnaire take breathalyzer test blood urine test drug . They may continue naltrexone therapy weekly group therapy session time . Subjects participate assessment program contact home phone week 1 month every week next 2 month monitor alcohol abstinence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Naltrexone Alcohol Craving Brain Activity During Alcohol Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcoholism chronic , progressive , brain disorder profound impact individual ' life economic cost society . The positive reinforcing effect alcohol key element transitional development alcohol intake alcohol addiction . Findings animal human study indicate reward property ethanol arise part complex interaction alcohol , endogenous opioids , dopamine ( DA ) system . Acute administration ethanol increase release opioid peptide , turn , increase release DA mesocorticolimbic system . Naltrexone ( NTX ) , opioid receptor antagonist , study widely preclinical clinical research treatment alcoholism . Numerous clinical study show short-term use NTX alcohol-dependent patient effectively prevents relapse reduces level craving . Genetic study suggest individual mu-opioid receptor ( OPRMs ) encode 118G gain-of function variant allele experience great therapeutic response NTX . There data utilize functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) study effect NTX brain activity intravenous ( IV ) infusion ethanol . Objectives : To study effect NTX blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) response ventral striatum area brain response ethanol infusion . To study effect NTX cue reactivity ( CR ) alcohol-associated cue . Study population : Alcohol-dependent patient age 21-50 year . Design : All participant complete screen telephone interview come NIAAA Inpatient Unit . The interviewer inform eligible participant requirement procedure associate current protocol . Following admission NIAAA Inpatient Unit , participant enrol Assessment Treatment People Alcohol Drinking Problems protocol ( # 05-AA-0121 ) . Protocol 05-AA-0121 allow u evaluate participant 's general medical psychiatric condition provide standard care treatment seek alcoholic . Participants , fulfill specific requirement NTX protocol , thoroughly inform nature study obtain informed consent . Consented participant randomize , use double-blind design , receive either 50 mg NTX per day placebo . Medications administer 8:00 AM daily basis nursing staff . Prior challenge procedure ( CR Day 7 fMRI/ethanol infusion Day 9 ) , clinical nurse specialist involve protocol re-consent participant acute withdrawal . The re-consenting process provide reassurance participant understand requirement implication associated participation CR fMRI/ethanol infusion procedure . Individuals elect participate CR fMRI/ethanol infusion session discharge in-patient unit encourage continue treatment NIAAA Outpatient Clinic next three month . Participants elect remain study take part CR session Day 7 fMRI/ethanol infusion session Day 9 ( procedure describe Page 13 study procedure ) . Following fMRI/ethanol infusion session , participant remain hospital approximately three week monitor crave take part inpatient treatment program alcoholism . During post-challenge hospitalization , participant offer 50 mg NTX day . Following discharge hospital , participant encourage continue treatment NIAAA Outpatient Clinic three month . Outcome Measures : BOLD response ethanol infusion challenge . BOLD brain response emotional facial stimulus . Self-reported Alcohol Urge Questionnaires ( AUQ ) , Penn Alcohol Craving Scale ( PACS ) , Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale ( OCDS ) Profile Mood Status ( POMS ) . Hormonal response ethanol challenge : plasma ACTH , cortisol , beta-endorphin . Subjective response ethanol challenge rat stimulation , sedation , high , intoxication questionnaire . Cue-induced crave CR session .</detailed_description>
