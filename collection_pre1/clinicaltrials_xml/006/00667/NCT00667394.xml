	<brief_summary>Background : In order survive , brain tumor must network blood vessel supply oxygen nutrient . The tumor produce substance enable new blood vessel form . Tandutinib Bevacizumab experimental drug may prevent new blood vessel formation thereby slow stop tumor growth brain . Objectives : To determine safety side effect Tandutinib combination Bevacizumab patient brain tumor . To evaluate response brain tumor treatment Tandutinib Bevacizumab . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age older malignant brain tumor standard treatment ( surgery , radiation chemotherapy ) longer effective . Design : Patients receive treatment 4-week cycle follow : Tandutinib mouth twice day every day intravenous ( vein ) infusion Bevacizumab 90 minute ( less well tolerate ) every 2 week . Treatment may continue 1 year , possibly longer , long sign tumor growth serious treatment side effect . Patients evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan start treatment periodically determine response treatment . Patients physical neurological examination every 4 week blood test every 2 week . They complete quality life questionnaire every 4 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tandutinib Plus Bevacizumab Treat Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody direct vascular- endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , major angiogenesis factor involve high-grade glioma-mediated angiogenesis . Preclinical study laboratory others show potent antiglioma activity vivo early clinical trial bevacizumab combination irinotecan alone ( National Institutes Health ( NIH ) study ) demonstrate significant anti-vascular permeability anti-glioma effect patient recurrent glioma . Tandutinib ( MLN518 ) along bevacizumab represent attempt capitalize concept target tumor vasculature . Tandutinib small molecule inhibitor fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ( FLT3 ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , cKIT ( type III receptor tyrosine kinase ) . It demonstrate anti-leukemic activity patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) whose blast contain activate internal tandem duplication mutation FLT3 . However , study tandutinib add bevacizumab primarily activity PDGFR cKIT . Hannahan colleague demonstrate additional anti-tumor activity result vivo combined inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) PDGFR . The activity PDGFR inhibition hypothesize result effect pericytes , cell surround support endothelial cell . These cell abundant expression PDGFR require platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -PDGFR interaction normal function . Objectives To establish data regard anti-tumor activity combination bevacizumab tandutinib patient recurrent high-grade glioma , determine progression-free-survival . Eligibility Patients histologically proven recurrent malignant glioma eligible study . Design Patients receive tandutinib single agent daily dose 500 mg PO bid first 14 day treatment . Radiology : Prior first dose tandutinib patient undergo MRI-perfusion scan FDG-PET scan . An MRI-perfusion scan repeat day 12-14 first 14 day tandutinib monotherapy . On day 15 , treatment bevacizumab add ongoing treatment tandutinib . Bevacizumab give intravenously dose 10 mg/kg , repeat every 2 week . After completion first 4 week combine tandutinib bevacizumab therapy ( 6 week initiate treatment tandutinib ) consider first cycle therapy ) MRI-perfusion fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan repeat next dose bevacizumab give . Patients clinically/neurologically stable , radiographically stable respond disease end first cycle every cycle thereafter ( every 4 week ) , continue treatment tandutinib bevacizumab . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -perfusion scan repeat completion every 4 week therapy . A total 80 patient enrol study ( GBM ( glioblastoma multiforme ) =40 , AG=40 )</detailed_description>
