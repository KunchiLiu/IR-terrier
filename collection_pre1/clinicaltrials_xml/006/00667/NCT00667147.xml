	<brief_summary>This study use drug Abraxane ( also call ABI-007 ) Vandetanib ( also call Zactima ZD6474 ) . Abraxane approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , treatment breast cancer . Vandetanib experimental drug approve FDA treatment condition . Vandetanib shrink non-small cell lung cancer , prostate cancer thyroid cancer study human . This combination drug approve treatment condition FDA . This study do two phase . The first phase trial two main objective : 1 ) To find high daily dose vandetanib give safely weekly Abraxane 2 ) To find high daily dose vandetanib give safely Abraxane give every three week . Participants randomly assign ( like flip coin ) receive Abraxane weekly ( Arm A ) every three week ( Arm B ) . The dose Abraxane give remain whole study - 100 mg/m2 give weekly 260 mg/m2 give every three week . Participants enter onto arm study group three , high dos vandetanib give group participant . The increase vandetanib stop one participant serious side effect . The high dose vandetanib give Abraxane ( without serious side effect ) Arm call pilot dose . In second phase study twenty participant randomly assign Arm A Arm B receive pilot dose vandetanib reach first phase study . The purpose second phase study see many tumor shrink participant receive pilot dose drug combination Arm , well gather information side effect .</brief_summary>

Patients must history torsades de pointes ventricular arrythmia Patients must prolong QT interval &gt; 450 msec baseline EKG presence normal serum magnesium value . Patients QTc Bazett 's correction unmeasurable ineligible . ( Note : If subject QTc interval less equal 450 msec screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must &lt; 450 msec order subject eligible study . ) Patients receive drug risk QTc prolongation exclude QTc â‰¥ 460 msec . Female patient must pregnant due potential mutagenicity teratogenicity treatment . A pregnancy test must administer 7 day prior administration therapy woman childbearing potential . Patients must agree use form contraception study initiation duration participation study . Sexually active male must also use reliable appropriate method contraception . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Patients must recover acute toxicity previous surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy Adequate organ function define : ANC &gt; 1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dL Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute Hepatic function : Patients must adequate liver function : AST ALT &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal . In patient bone metastasis evidence liver metastasis bilirubin &lt; upper limit normal alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 ULN allow . In patient know liver involvement : AST ALT alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 ULN , Serum Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL Peripheral neuropathy grade 01 No concomitant therapy direct cancer allow . All prior therapy must complete &gt; 4 week prior study enrollment . Patients diagnose advanced prostate cancer must progress intolerant docetaxel base regimen . Laboratory result : Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 upper limit reference range ( ULRR ) Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULRR creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute ( calculate CockcroftGault formula . ) Potassium , &lt; 4.0 mmol/L despite supplementation ; serum calcium ( ionize adjust albumin , ) magnesium normal range despite supplementation Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make undesirable patient participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol . Clinically significant cardiovascular event ( e.g . myocardial infarction , superior vena cava syndrome ( SVC ) , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification heart disease &gt; 2 ( see Appendix B ) within 3 month entry ; presence cardiac disease , opinion Investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia . History arrhythmia ( multifocal premature ventricular contraction ( PVCs ) , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ) symptomatic require treatment ( CTCAE grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude . QTc prolongation medication require discontinuation medication . Congenital long QT syndrome , 1st degree relative unexplained sudden death 40 year age . Presence leave bundle branch block ( LBBB . ) Any concurrent medication may cause QTc prolongation induce Torsades de Pointes ( Protocol Appendix A list relevant medication risk Torsades de Pointes QTc prolongation . ) Drugs list Appendix A , Table 2 , investigator 's opinion discontinue , allow however , must monitor closely ( please see section 4.2 ) . Hypertension control medical therapy ( systolic blood pressure great 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 100 mm Hg ) Currently active diarrhea may affect ability patient absorb Vandetanib tolerate diarrhea . Women currently pregnant breast feeding . Receipt investigational agent within 30 day prior commence study treatment Last dose prior chemotherapy discontinue less 4 week start study therapy Last radiation therapy within last 4 week start study therapy , except palliative radiotherapy Any unresolved toxicity great CTC grade 1 previous anticancer therapy Major surgery within 4 week incompletely heal surgical incision start study therapy . Previous enrollment current study . Patients follow condition : Colon cancer , Rectal cancer</criteria>
