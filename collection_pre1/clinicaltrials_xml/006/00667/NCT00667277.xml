	<brief_summary>Myelofibrosis gradual replacement bone marrow ( place new blood cell produce ) fibrous tissue reduce body 's ability produce new blood cell result development chronic anemia ( low red blood cell count ) . One main distinction myelofibrosis `` extramedullary hematopoiesis '' , migration travel blood-forming cell bone part body , liver spleen , result enlarge spleen liver . There standard treatment myelofibrosis , therefore medication specifically use treatment myelofibrosis . Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) target stop growth factor body help produce type fibrous tissue gradually replace bone marrow bone . The purpose study find safe effective bevacizumab treat myelofibrosis . The investigator also wish find important biologic characteristic feature myelofibrosis ( work operate ) time study participation additional correlative biomarker study ( MPD-RC # 107 ) . The purpose biomarker study understand cause MPD develop improve method diagnosis treatment disease , main study try find well bevacizumab work treat disease .</brief_summary>
