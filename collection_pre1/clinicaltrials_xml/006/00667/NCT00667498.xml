	<brief_title>Metabolic Effect Metformin Obese Insulin Resistant Adolescents With Normal Glucose Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First Visit Patients agree participate research study , initial screen subject ask his/her health , sample blood drawn , subject examine , oral glucose tolerance ( OGTT ) test do . - OGTT : The study take four hour begin `` empty stomach . '' A small I.V . place vein subject 's arm . The I.V . allow member research team take small amount blood measure glucose substance circulate blood . About 7 tablespoon blood drawn total OGTT . The I.V . remain place study . At begin study , subject ask drink 8 ounce ( one cup ) high sugar cola- orange-flavored drink . If subject meet requirement study normal glucose tolerance test , he/she randomize either intensely ( Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp ) standard study group follow six seven test perform : DEXA scan Tanita , exercise step test , PAT test , MRI ( Abdominal scan ) , MRS ( leg scan ) , Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp ( intensely study group ) . All test describe . Females urine pregnancy test test . If positive , subject allow participate/continue study . - DEXA / Tanita : The DEXA scan measure much muscle fat subject 's body dense subject 's bone use x-ray technique . Directly DEXA Scan , subject 's percentage body fat measure use Tanita scale . - Exercise Step Test : The subject ask step two step 20 time pace . We measure subject 's heart rate directly three minute exercise . After ten minute break , test repeat . - Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( PAT ) : This test allow u evaluate response small blood vessel subject 's arm change nerve signal . During test , put probe ( similar tight-fitting glove ) one finger subject 's hand take measurement five minute . The probe contain latex , test perform subject allergic latex . Following measurement , block blood flow one hand five minute put blood pressure cuff one arm inflate cuff . After pressure cuff release , take measurement five minute . - MRI ( Belly Scan ) : Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) use take picture subject 's belly . These picture allow u calculate much fat subject skin much fat deeper inside belly . We also able estimate percentage fat subject 's liver . - MRS ( Leg scan ) : We measure much fat subject 's calf muscle use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . - Insulin , Glucose Glycerol Infusion Study ( Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp ) : A small I.V . place vein arm . One I.V . use take small amount blood measure blood sugar substance circulate blood . The I.V . use infuse insulin , glucose , glycerol subject 's blood . Insulin hormone help bring blood sugar cell . Glycerol component fat normally present person 's body . This infusion affect subject 's blood sugar harmful manner . It allow u follow release glucose liver glycerol fat tissue . The subject 's blood sugar check closely study take blood sample second I.V . Readings blood sugar sample make bedside . If blood sugar start fall , fix right away . At end another three hour , infusion stop subject eat meal provide him/her . The infusion glucose reduce subject eating subject 's blood sugar stable . This test take 6 hour . The total amount blood draw test less 8 tablespoon half cup . Indirect calorimetry way measure much sugar fat person burn give insulin . Testing much fat sugar subject burn important part insulin , glucose , glycerol infusion study . Therefore ask subject wear plastic hood ( like astronaut space helmet ) start infusion insulin two time study . Taking Metformin Placebo Once subject complete six ( standard study group ) seven ( intensely study group ) test describe , well two urine test protein , he/she randomize either : - Take Metformin ; - Take placebo pill The subject begin take one pill ( either Metformin placebo ) every day , supper . The dose slowly increase follow : Week 1 : Before breakfast = 0 Before supper = 1 ( 500mg ) ; Week 2 : Before breakfast = 1 ( 500mg ) Before supper = 1 ( 500mg ) ; Week 3-14 : Before breakfast = 1 ( 500mg ) Before supper = 2 ( 500mg ) The subject take pill 3 1/2 month , time ask he/she keep diary complaint , problem , symptom . Neither subject , subject 's doctor , member research team find pill subject take end study . Monthly Follow-up Subjects ask come back every month physical exam . We measure height , weight , blood pressure time . A urine pregnancy test do female participant every visit . At subject 's first follow visit draw small amount blood run test make sure subject healthy . We ask subject his/her parent symptom subject , pill he/she might miss take , use medication . We measure subject 's vitamin B12 level his/her third follow visit . End Study About three month subject begin take Metformin placebo pill , he/she repeat test describe ( oral glucose tolerance test , DEXA Tanita , exercise step test , PAT test , MRI , MRS ) . In sub-group participant glucose , insulin , glycerol infusion test , also repeat end study . Open Label Phase ( Taking Metformin ) After test describe complete , participant ( even assign placebo pill ) give choice take Metformin next six month . If subject choose continue , continue monitor him/her monthly , described section monthly follow-up . At end additional six month , repeat test subject begin study . For intensely study group , include insulin , glucose glycerol infusion .</detailed_description>
