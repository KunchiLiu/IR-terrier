	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) determine whether 3-month exercise rehabilitation program improve claudication distance , free-living daily physical activity , health-related quality life old , revascularized patient peripheral arterial disease , ( 2 ) determine whether primary mechanism exercise rehabilitation affect functional outcome alteration walk efficiency , peripheral circulation , cardiopulmonary function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Elderly Peripheral Revascularized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) patient critical limb-threatening ischemia improve peripheral circulation follow infrainguinal revascularization . Despite hemodynamic benefit , little change functional status occurs , many patient residual ambulatory dysfunction . The lack functional improvement revascularized patient may due extreme physical deconditioning secondary pre-existing critical limb-threatening ischemia . Therefore , hypothesize program aerobic exercise training necessary optimize ambulation , free-living daily physical activity , health-related quality life mechanism improve walk economy , peripheral circulation , cardiopulmonary function . This prospective , randomize control clinical trial compare exercise group undergo program grade treadmill walking , non-exercise control group . Eighty PAD patient randomize either exercise group ( N = 40 ) non-exercise control group ( N = 40 ) follow successful low extremity arterial bypass angioplasty . The 3-month exercise program consist grade treadmill walk 3 time per week progressive increment exercise duration 15 40 minute , progressive increment exercise intensity 50 80 % exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
