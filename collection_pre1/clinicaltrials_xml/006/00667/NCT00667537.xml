	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To investigate biodistribution , radiation dosimetry , pharmacokinetics two separate intravenous ( IV ) injection Xofigo ( 100 kBq/kg body weight [ b.w . ] [ =110 kBq/kg base 2015 National Institute Standards Technology standardization ] , 6 week apart ) . Secondary objective : To determine safety IV injection Xofigo two separate injection ( 6 week apart ) , evaluate treatment response ( antitumour effect osteoblastic bone metastasis ) Xofigo treatment consist two injection activity 100 kBq/kg b.w . ( =110 kBq/kg base 2015 National Institute Standards Technology standardization ) , 6 week apart evaluate long term radiation toxicity collect survival data 6 12 month first injection</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Hormone refractory evidence rise prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) : Subject must maintain androgen ablation therapy luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist undergone bilateral orchiectomy Serum testosterone level require ≤50 ng/dL Subjects receive prior antiandrogen drug therapy : Flutamide , nilutamide , cyproterone acetate must stop least 4 week prior study drug administration progression , define rise PSA define , must demonstrate since cessation ; bicalutamide must stop least 6 week prior study drug administration progression , define rise PSA define , must demonstrate since cessation PSA progression : Progressive rise PSA , define two consecutive increase PSA document previous reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first increase PSA ( measure 2 ) occur minimum 1 week reference value ( measure 1 ) . This increase PSA confirm ( measure 3 ) minimum 1 week . If confirmatory PSA value ( measure 3 ) less previous value , subject still eligible provide next PSA measure ( measure 4 ) find great second PSA value ( measure 2 ) Skeletal metastasis confirm bone scintigraphy within last 6 week Performance status : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 Life expectancy : ≥6 month Laboratory requirement : Neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L , platelet count ≥100 x109/L , haemoglobin ≥95 g/L , total bilirubin level within normal institutional limit , aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 time upper institutional limit normal range , S Creatinine ≤1.5 time upper institutional limit normal range Has receive investigational drug within 4 week prior administration radium223 , schedule receive one treatment posttreatment period Has receive chemo , immunotherapy , external radiotherapy within last 4 week prior administration study drug , recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier More one regimen previous cytotoxic chemotherapy Has receive prior hemibody external radiotherapy Has need immediate external radiotherapy Has receive systemic radiotherapy radium223 , strontium89 , samarium153 , rhenium186 rhenium188 treatment bony metastasis within last year prior administration study drug Has start treatment bisphosphonates less 3 month prior administration study drug . Patients allow bisphosphonates provide patient stable dose &gt; /= 12 week administration study drug Patients &lt; /= 4 week ( 6 week bicalutamide ) post withdrawal antiandrogen therapy Patients start stop systemic steroid , within week prior study drug administration , expect subject change systemic steroid medication Other currently active ( relapse within last 3 year ) malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) prostate cancer metastases Visceral ( e.g . liver , lung ) metastases prostate cancer assess abdominal/ pelvic CT chest radiograph within six week administration study drug Lymph node metastasis shortaxis diameter great 2 cm Bulky locoregional disease Any serious illness medical condition , example : uncontrolled infection , patient clinical heart failure severe enough cause mark limitation activity , comfortable rest ; patient heart failure severe ( NYHA Heart Failure Class III IV ) , Crohns disease ulcerative colitis</criteria>
