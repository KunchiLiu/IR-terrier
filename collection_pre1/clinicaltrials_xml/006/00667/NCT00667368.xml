	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether regular screening ( every 2 month ) treatment bacterial vaginosis ( BV [ infection vagina ] ) reduce number incidence chlamydia gonorrhea ( sexually transmit disease ) course year . Chlamydial gonococcal infection determine vaginal swab test 4 , 8 , 12 month enrollment . Subjects include 1500 woman age 15-25 year clinical evidence BV , symptom . Subjects randomly assign 1 2 possible study group : intervention group ( treatment BV ) control group ( BV treatment ) . Every 2 month , subject complete home self-testing kit screen BV use swab . If BV detect self-test , subject interventional group receive 7 day course antibiotic metronidazole . Participants involve study related procedure 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) characterize imbalance normal vaginal bacterial flora . In United States ( US ) , BV common , common cause vaginitis , affect approximately 1 10 sexually active young woman . Because BV common , intervention target BV could tremendous public health impact . This phase III randomize control trial , primary objective determine whether regular screening ( every two month ) treatment asymptomatic BV reduce one-year incidence chlamydial gonococcal infection , compare control group woman receive regular monitoring ( every two month ) BV treatment . The secondary study objective determine demographic behavioral factor associated acquisition BV , persistence among woman treat condition , spontaneous resolution , recurrence woman treat condition . This study protocol enroll 1500 sexually active female , age 15 - 25 year , 6 US city involve Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinical Trials Group network ( Birmingham , Durham , Raleigh , Pittsburgh , Baltimore San Francisco ) . To eligible , woman must 2 risk factor sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) must clinical evidence asymptomatic BV enrollment . For purpose study , woman vaginal pH &gt; 4.5 &gt; 20 percent clue cell detect microscopy asymptomatic BV . In addition , woman must deny presence unusual abnormal vaginal discharge odor . Subjects receive bi-monthly ( every two month ) home self-testing kit BV use vaginal swab . If BV detect self-test , subject intervention group receive antibiotic treatment consist metronidazole 500mg twice daily 7 day . Subjects randomize either intervention group ( screen treatment BV ) control group ( monitor BV without treatment ) . Subjects intervention group control group complete bi-monthly ( every 2 month ) follow-up assessment BV month 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 ( final follow-up ) . In addition , subject provide sample collection Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 , 8 , 12 month study entry .</detailed_description>
