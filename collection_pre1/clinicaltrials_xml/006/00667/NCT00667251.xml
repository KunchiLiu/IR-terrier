	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : HER2/neu receptor ( protein ) find unusually high amount approximately 1 5 cancer patient . Scientific evidence suggest high amount HER2/neu receptor important breast cancer grow spread . Women previously untreated metastatic breast cancer ( breast cancer spread organ ) high level HER2/neu receptor receive usual treatment chemotherapy one approve chemotherapy drug paclitaxel docetaxel ( call `` taxanes '' ) together another approve drug call `` trastuzumab '' . Chemotherapy drug , paclitaxel docetaxel , work either kill tumour cell stop dividing . Trastuzumab antibody give vein arm work specifically `` target '' HER2/neu i.e . attach `` turn '' . Although patient receive taxane plus trastuzumab treatment feel good month , cancer usually start grow . Lapatinib new drug . Like trastuzumab , also work specifically `` target '' HER2/neu receptor , different way . Lapatinib antibody . It pill take daily mouth . Because lapatinib work different way trastuzumab , may worse , good good trastuzumab keep metastatic HER/neu positive cancer grow . However , know . Purpose : This randomized Phase III trial compare chemotherapy ( taxane ) give together lapatinib chemotherapy ( taxane ) give together trastuzumab woman HER2/neu positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival woman HER2/neu-positive metastatic breast cancer treat taxane-based chemotherapy combination lapatinib ditosylate trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) . Secondary - To compare overall survival . - To compare time CNS metastasis time first progression . - To compare incidence rate CNS metastases time progression . - To compare overall objective response rate ( complete partial response ) , time response , duration response patient measurable disease baseline . - To compare clinical benefit response rate . - To compare adverse event profile . - To compare quality life . - To compare clinical outcome use biomarker change biological sample . - To compare health economics , include healthcare utilization health utility . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-HER2/neu-targeted therapy ( yes v ) , prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant taxane chemotherapy ( yes v ) , plan taxane therapy ( paclitaxel v docetaxel ) , liver metastasis ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive either paclitaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 ; treatment paclitaxel repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Alternatively , patient may receive docetaxel IV day 1 ; treatment docetaxel repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients docetaxel also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) accord institutional standard . All patient receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily taxane treatment continue completion taxane treatment , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Alternatively , patient may receive docetaxel IV trastuzumab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion taxane chemotherapy trastuzumab , patient receive trastuzumab alone IV every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sample analyze ER , PgR , EGFR , CK5/6 , Ki67 , molecular biomarkers tissue microarray immunohistochemistry . Patients complete quality life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 Trial Specific Checklist ) baseline , every 12 week 96 week , every 24 week disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week post treatment , every 12 week thereafter ( count begin study therapy ) .</detailed_description>
