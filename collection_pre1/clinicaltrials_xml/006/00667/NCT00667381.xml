	<brief_title>Femoral Arterial Access With Ultrasound Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac catheterization conventionally perform femoral arterial access use combination arterial pulse palpation , anatomical landmark , fluoroscopic landmark guide needle insertion . Vascular access complication include hematoma formation , retroperitoneal bleeding , arterial dissection common type adverse event associate cardiac catheterization , associate insertion level common femoral artery . Real-time ultrasound assistance central venous catheter placement proven multiple study reduce complication , recommend Agency Healthcare Research Quality `` Top 11 Highly Proven '' patient safety practice . This recommendation yet extend arterial access , due lack study date . However , ultrasound assistance license commonly utilized arterial access , especially difficult patient . In pilot study 71 procedure perform lead researcher , ultrasound guidance associate improve 1st pas success rate ( 83 % vs 47 % , p=0.002 ) , reduce risk accidental venipuncture ( 0 % vs 25 % , p=0.002 ) , great overall success common femoral artery cannulation ( 89 % vs 69 % , p=0.048 ) compare fluoroscopic control . This study multicenter prospective randomize trial generalize finding patient study , large number operator , across several center . Similar previous study , ultrasound use real-time visualize femoral vein , femoral artery , needle tract needle insert , guide needle towards appropriate location artery . The time insertion , number pass , complication , position insertion catheter femoral angiogram analyze setting patient factor include age , body mass index , presence peripheral vascular disease .</detailed_description>
