	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , triptorelin , may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give triptorelin radiation therapy soon surgery later surgery effective treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give triptorelin radiation therapy soon surgery see well work compare give later surgery treat patient undergone surgery intermediate-risk stage III stage IV prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triptorelin Radiation Therapy Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Intermediate-Risk Stage III Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy , term event-free survival 5 year , immediate radio-hormonal therapy immediately prostatectomy tumor pT2 , R1 , pN0 , pNx versus radio-hormonal therapy biochemical relapse . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare metastasis-free survival patient . - Compare acute late toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare functional dependence patient 75 year old . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( delay treatment ) : Patients receive triptorelin intramuscularly day 1 3 month later . Patients also undergo conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 7 week . Treatment begin biochemical relapse ( PSA 0.2 ng/mL ) PSA 2 ng/mL . - Arm II ( immediate treatment ) : Patients receive treatment arm I , treatment begin within 6 month surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
