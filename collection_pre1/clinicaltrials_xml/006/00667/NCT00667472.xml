	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome response laser therapy . The researcher want determine whether combine use pulse dye laser therapy topical ranibizumab improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Pulsed Dye Laser Topical Ranibizumab Treatment Port Wine Stain Birthmarks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combined use pulse dye laser induce port wine stain blood vessel injury , ranibizumab prevent port wine stain blood vessel angiogenesis recanalization laser therapy , improve port wine stain lesion blanching . After pulsed dye laser treatment entire port wine stain , topical ranibizumab apply two test site two week follow pulsed dye laser therapy . The degree port wine stain blanch quantify objectively use visible reflectance spectroscopy measurement . port wine stain test site blanch response follow combine use pulse dye laser topical ranibizumab compare pulsed dye laser baseline control .</detailed_description>
