	<brief_title>Riluzole Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate potential effect glutamate receptor blockade cellular pathway important genesis progression melanoma patient stage III IV melanoma undergo surgical resection . - To determine whether treatment riluzole alters expression activate PLC ERK lysates tumor tissue biopsy . Secondary - Determine treatment riluzole affect overall metabolic activity melanoma tumor measure pre- post-treatment PET scanning , pre- post-treatment tumor mitotic rate evaluation , pre- post-treatment immunohistochemical stain Ki-67 . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily 14 day . Within 24 hour final dose riluzole , patient undergo standard surgical resection . Patients undergo tumor tissue sample collection baseline surgery laboratory study . Samples analyze routine histology , immunohistochemistry , western blotting , RT-PCR Grm1 expression , - RAS B-raf mutation , PLC MAP kinase activity , Ki-67 staining , mitotic rate . Patients also undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetics study . PET scan obtain treatment evaluate overall metabolic activity tumor activity change inhibition Grm1 pathway .</detailed_description>
