	<brief_summary>The purpose study replace drug many side effect , procarbazine , new novel drug , vorinostat , drug combination treatment patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Vorinostat first new type chemotherapy drug , know histone deacetylase inhibitor , approve Food Drug Administration . It approve treatment certain lymphomas skin . It alter cancer cell pathway prevent cancer cell reproduce . Vorinostat add combination four effective chemotherapy drug use many year treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma : rituximab , cyclophosphamide , etoposide prednisone . The dos vorinostat increase decreased depend side effect occur first patient trial find safe dose least side effect . This termed phase I part clinical trial . Once best dose vorinostat find , rest patient clinical trial treat dose . This term phase II part trial . The object trial find effect , good and/or bad , combination vorinostat , rituximab , cyclophosphamide , etoposide prednisone lymphoma .</brief_summary>

Measurable disease Adequate organ bone marrow function : ANC ≥ 1000/mm3 , platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 , total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN ( exception Gilbert 's disease ) , AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 ULN , creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min , potassium magnesium within normal limit . Male patient agree use adequate method contraception duration study . Patient available periodic blood sampling , study related assessment , management treat institution duration study . Patient chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy [ include growth factor ] , within 30 day ( 42 day nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior initial dose study drug ( ) recover adverse event due agent administer 30 day earlier . Patients stable dose steroid least 4 week prior onset study therapy may include . Patient currently participate participate study investigational compound device within 30 day initial dose study drug ( ) . Patient prior treatment HDAC inhibitor ( e.g. , romidespin ( Depsipeptide ) , NSC630176 , MS 275 , LAQ824 , belinostat ( PXD101 ) , LBH589 , MGCD0103 , CRA024781 , etc ) . Patients receive compound HDAC inhibitorlike activity , valproic acid , antitumor therapy enroll study . Patients receive compounds indication , e.g . valproic acid epilepsy , may enroll 30day washout period . Patients active CNS lymphoma and/or lymphomatous meningitis exclude . However , patient history CNS lymphoma and/or lymphomatous meningitis stable without evidence CNS and/or leptomeningeal recurrence would eligible . They must steroids stable dose steroid . Patient primary central nervous system lymphoma . Patient known hypersensitivity component study drug analog . Patient know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial .
