	<brief_title>Comparison Nocturnal Hemodialysis ( NHD ) Short Daily Hemodialysis ( DHD ) With NxStage® System One™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) continue devastate clinical condition . The number patient 2004 affected ESRD United States rise 472,000 . More 104,000 new patient begin therapy ESRD 2004 ( 1.5 % great 2003 ) , prevalent dialysis population reach nearly 336,000 ( 3.4 % high ) . Total Medicare cost ESRD 2004 rise $ 20.1 billion non-Medicare cost rise $ 12.4 Billion ( 1 ) . Treatment option ESRD patient currently limit either transplantation dialysis . As daily hemodialysis ( DHD ) continue gain widespread acceptance dialysis community , also renew interest nocturnal hemodialysis ( NHD ) therapy . NHD potential provide certain advantage DHD conventional thrice-weekly in-center HD . NHD typically consist 6 - 10 hour treatment patient sleep , provide gentle fluid removal , time equilibration , improve hemodynamic stability superior clearance large solute ( 2 ) . The propose study plan explore whether NHD equivalent DHD per treatment basis , use NxStage System One home setting . 1 .
