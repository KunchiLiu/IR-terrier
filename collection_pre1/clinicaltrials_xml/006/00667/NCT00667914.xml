	<brief_title>A New Clinical Pathway Patients With Fractured Neck Femur</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intention present project evaluate effectiveness multi-factorial medical treatment patient hip fracture specially design geriatric unit elderly hip fracture patient ( orthogeriatric unit ) compare traditional care orthopedic unit . Every year 9000 patient undergo surgery hip fracture Norway . The epidemic hip fracture among common cause acute hospitalization old people associate high morbidity , mortality , disability subsequent hospital social cost well reduction quality life . Traditionally hip fracture surgery perform follow care orthopedic department . Additional rehabilitation within hospital sometimes provide geriatrician team rehabilitation specialist , lot variety rehabilitation programme . Studies show improved outcome older people care specialist multidisciplinary team . However , result conclusive research need also field , state Cochrane review . It well know hip-fracture patient frequently characterize high age , co-morbidity frailty , may often main reason fall injury hip fracture . In previous project perform group show treat acutely sick , frail elderly patient geriatric evaluation management unit mortality significantly reduce patient ' chance live home improve . Later research group focus assessment treatment old person risk fall . Now start focus ultimate consequence fall frail elderly people : hip fracture , observational study . The present study partly also consequence . The present project primarily examine effect establish radical new clinical pathway patient hip fracture start immediately admittance hospital randomize patient treatment orthogeriatric unit ( intervention group ) treatment orthopedic ward ( control group ) emergency department . There specific follow-up discharge hospital . Primary endpoint evaluate possible effect mobility measure Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . As secondary endpoint relevant functional aspect , site residence , health economic variable mortality study . This study give increase scientific understand whether treatment specialize orthogeriatric unit improve outcome mobility , extensive number nurse home admission high mortality hip fracture .</detailed_description>
