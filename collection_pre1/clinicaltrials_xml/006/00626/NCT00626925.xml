	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy topiramate reduce drink heavy drinking frequency problem drinker . We hypothesize dosage 200mg/day , topiramate well tolerated patient population , compare placebo treatment , topiramate result great reduction frequency drinking day heavy drinking day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate 30 % general population problem drinker ( NIAAA 2007 ) . Despite high prevalence , problem drinker understudy , particularly respect medication may help reduce drink safe level . The study extend patient population finding trial topiramate , show drug well tolerate efficacious moderately-severe alcohol-dependent patient ( Johnson et al . 2003 ) . This 13-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled study topiramate ( 12 week dosage study medication gradually increase 200 mg orally maintain , 1 week medication taper ) medical management counseling reduce drinking among problem drinker ( i.e. , heavy drinker without evidence physical dependence alcohol ) want reduce drinking . Participants attend weekly study visit first 5 week bi-weekly visit last 8 week study , randomly assign receive topiramate placebo daily basis . In addition study visit , participant report daily mood , drinking , medication usage Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system call night . In-person follow-up evaluation conduct 3 6 month post-treatment provide measure durability treatment effect . This study also aim examine relation genotype response topiramate treatment . An additional aim conduct substudy examine neural cell generate skin fibroblast cell obtain study participant via skin biopsy ( participation substudy completely optional ) . Initially , examine variable key reliably generate neuron cell characterize neuron use variety laboratory measure . A long term goal compare gene expression individual show robust reduction drink follow treatment topiramate show beneficial treatment effect . A second additional aim explore whether therapeutic adverse effect topiramate similar patient stable regimen antidepressant receive therapy . Although exploratory , give absence data directly address issue , stratify subject presence absence current antidepressant therapy . Careful evaluation study 's hypothesis provide important information efficacy mechanism effect topiramate treatment problem drinker .</detailed_description>
