	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether sunitinib effective give surgery treat kidney cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect sunitinib compare well work give surgery treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Before After Surgery Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare activity sunitinib malate administer vs cytoreductive nephrectomy , term response rate , patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . - To compare safety regimens patient . Secondary - To compare time progression patient treat regimen . - To compare duration response patient treat regimen . - To compare overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy . Patients receive adjuvant therapy comprise oral sunitinib malate daily 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may continue treatment beyond 1 year discretion investigator . - Arm II : Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy comprise oral sunitinib malate daily 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course . After completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy follow adjuvant sunitinib malate arm I . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
