	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy tolerability single dose aplindore compare placebo RLS . Patients required spend 5-8 night sleep laboratory . This include 1 adaptation night , 1 placebo night , 3-6 drug treatment night . Ascending dos active drug administer study night 3 5 determine maximum well tolerate efficacious dose ( defined decrease Periodic Limb Movement Index ( PLMI ) least 50 % placebo baseline ) . If efficacious dose identify Investigator consultation sponsor may decide examine high dos 3 additional PSG night attempt identify tolerable efficacious dose . This study utilize 24 evaluable patient , meet International Classification Sleep Disorders ( ICSD-2 ) diagnostic criterion primary RLS currently take RLS medication include DAs ( L-dopa ) able discontinue RLS medication least 5 half-lives prior adaptation night .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Aplindore Treatment Signs Symptoms Restless Legs Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) neurosensorimotor disorder uncertain etiology commonly disturbs sleep . The main feature disorder paresthesia felt deep limb trouble individual rest . The paresthesias RLS commonly increase even early part night . Patients commonly less bothered symptom morning , unless severely affect . The repetitive movement lead arousal may also cause subset patient become quite sleepy daytime . This sleepiness usually severe find patient sleep apnea narcolepsy quite disruptive quality life daytime functioning . Recent survey indicate RLS occur 10 % 15 % North American population . A common associated feature RLS Periodic Limb Movements Sleep ( PLMS ) . These repetitive movement typically occur flexion foot , knee , hip interval 5 90 second . Most commonly , interval 20 40 second . The movement present non-rapid-eye-movement ( REM ) sleep less common REM sleep . Population-based study find RLS associate increase risk hypertension coronary artery disease . Periodic leg movement -related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuation may contribute increase risk cardiovascular disease especially elderly19 . There possibility dopamine agonist ( DA ) reduction PLMS may mitigate risk cardiovascular complication RLS . The potential role aplindore reduce PLMS nocturnal blood pressure fluctuation evaluate study . Dopaminergic agents become common medication use treatment RLS PLMS . Aplindore orally available , small molecule partial agonist D2 dopamine receptor . Preclinical vitro vivo result demonstrate functional agonist selectivity aplindore supersensitive D2 receptor striatum , extra-striatal D2 receptor . Stimulation D2 receptor area deficient dopamine attribute aplindore 's low intrinsic activity high affinity receptor . Aplindore study preclinical toxicology study rat 6 month monkey 1 year safety margin excess 100-fold relative project human efficacious dos . The primary objective study assess efficacy tolerability single dose aplindore compare placebo RLS . The secondary objective generate safety data aplindore support outpatient trial RLS . b ) To generate pilot data effect aplindore change blood pressure heart rate associate PLMS patient RLS . c ) To understand concentration-effect relationship aplindore RLS symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 18 year old ; Diagnosis primary Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) use ICSD2 criterion : The patient report urge move leg , usually accompany cause uncomfortable unpleasant sensation leg . The urge move unpleasant sensation begin worsen period rest inactivity lie sit . The urge move unpleasant sensation partially totally relieved movement , walk stretch , least long activity continue . The urge move unpleasant sensation bad , occur , even night . The condition well explain another current sleep disorder , medical neurological disorder , mental disorder , medication use , substance use disorder . International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group ( IRLSSG ) RLS rating scale score &gt; 15 screen PLMI great 10 per hour total sleep time ( TST ) determine PSG adaptation night ; Body mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 35 kg/m2 ; In good general health determine thorough medical history physical examination ( include vital sign ) , 12lead ECG ( lab test mention ) Patients clinical laboratory value within normal reference range must clinically significantly abnormal judged Investigator approve Sponsor ; Patients must prescription drug therapy OTC medication may take RLS well psychotropic medication least 5 half life prior adaptation night investigational drug least 30 day ; Patients take prescription overthecounter medication chronic medical condition must stable dos medication least two week prior participation study . If patient female childbearing potential , must use acceptable method contraception , must negative urine pregnancy test screening , must negative urine pregnancy test adaptation night . Acceptable method contraception oral , intrauterine , implantable , injectable contraceptive double barrier method . After screen , patient use oral contraceptive must agree add double barrier method 30 day follow last dose study medication . Women oral contraceptive must use least one month prior screen . Be able read , understand , provide written/dated informed consent enrol study , must willing comply study procedure ; Patients must willing able confine clinical research site period 5 night require protocol . Patients must refrain strenuous physical activity day admission PSG day . Clinically significant unstable medical illness ; Evidence history clinically significant allergic ( except untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) , hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurological disease ; History nonBasal Cell cancer within 5 year screen ; History nongestational diabetes within 5 year screen ; A supine blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm/Hg screen adaptation ; Clinically significant psychiatric illness , include chronic psychiatric illness history presence Axis I condition ; History presence chronic pain associated RLS ; History epilepsy serious head injury ; Clinically significant sleep apnea , narcolepsy , parasomnia adult , circadian rhythm disorder , secondary cause RLS ; An apneahypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 10 , assess PSG adaptation night Any condition may affect oral drug absorption ; Travel across three time zone , expect change sleep schedule 6 hour , involvement night shift work within seven day prior screen study period ; Any clinically significant abnormal find physical examination , vital sign , ECG , clinical laboratory test , determine Investigator . ( The QTcB interval must ≤ 450 msec male ≤ 470 msec female ) ; History allergy , know sensitivity , hypersensitivity , adverse reaction drug similar aplindore ; Pregnant lactating female ; Recent history ( ≤ one year ) alcohol drug abuse , current evidence substance dependence abuse define DSMIV criterion ; Regular consumption large amount xanthinecontaining substance ( i.e . 5 cup coffee equivalent amount xanthinecontaining substance per day ) ; Self report usual consumption 14 unit alcohol per week ; Secondary cause RLS rule physical exam , medical history clinical chemistry , include serum ferritin ; Use investigational drug within 30 day prior screen ;</criteria>
