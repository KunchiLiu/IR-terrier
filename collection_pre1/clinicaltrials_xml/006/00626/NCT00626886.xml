	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether CollaRx Bupivacaine implant safe effective reducing amount narcotic pain medication need control pain first 24 hour herniorrhaphy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Pharmacokinetic Profile Collagen Bupivacaine Implant Men After Open Mesh Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal herniorrhaphy common surgery ; common surgical method use include laparoscopic open placement synthetic mesh . The use synthetic mesh greatly reduce risk hernia recurrence regardless method use placement . Managing postoperative pain prevent morbidity open mesh herniorrhaphy remain considerable medical challenge . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medicine ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery . This study compare amount narcotic pain medication require surgery patient receive either CollaRx Bupivacaine implant plain collagen sponge .</detailed_description>
