	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving high-dose radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study radiation therapy see well work treat patient undergone surgery newly diagnose grade II grade III meningioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Newly Diagnosed Grade II Grade III Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess impact high-dose radiotherapy ( RT ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) , treatment tolerance , post-treatment global cognitive functioning patient atypical ( WHO grade II ) malignant ( WHO grade III ) meningioma . OUTLINE : Patients grade II disease stratify accord resection status ( complete excision [ Simpson 's stage 1-3 ] v incomplete excision [ Simpson 's stage 4-5 ] ) participate phase II study . These patient assign 1 2 treatment group accord Simpson staging . Only data patient analyzed respect progression-free survival endpoint . Patients grade III disease treat group 1 2 accord Simpson staging ( patient grade II disease ) . After treatment , clinical result patient observed describe . - Group 1 ( Simpson stage 1-3 ) : Beginning later 6 week follow surgery , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 6 week . - Group 2 ( Simpson stage 4-5 ) : Beginning later 6 week follow surgery , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 7 week . Patients complete Mini-Mental Status Exam baseline 6 week 6 month completion study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , 6 12 month , annually least 3 year .</detailed_description>
