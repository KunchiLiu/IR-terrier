	<brief_title>The Effects Walnuts Antioxidant Capacity Nutritional Status Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study conduct large population consistently show increased consumption plant-based , antioxidant-rich food , i.e. , fruit , vegetable , grain , nut , reduces risk several chronic disease . Among various plant consume worldwide , English walnut ( Juglans regia L. ) report high antioxidant activity , second rosehip ( Rosa canina L. ) . There number different compound present walnut know exhibit antioxidant activity , include vitamin E ( γ-tocopherol ) , melatonin , several non-flavonoid polyphenols ( e.g. , ellagic acid monomer polymeric ellagitannins ) . In vitro ex vivo , study demonstrate ability walnut walnut extract increase resistance low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) oxidation . Walnuts and/or constituent also show decrease level oxidative stress diabetic mouse increase serum antioxidant capacity rats2 . In human , vivo antioxidant capacity change consume walnut measure subject Type 2 diabetes . The antioxidant capacity lipophilic compartment , well cooperative/synergistic interaction water- fat-soluble antioxidant present plasma walnut consumption measure . Indeed , study conduct date effect walnut consumption total antioxidant capacity healthy men woman . The goal propose study determine consume walnuts amount readily incorporate diet affect antioxidant capacity old adult .</detailed_description>
