	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect gemcitabine plus capecitabine patient pancreatic biliary cancer , determine optimal dose give safely two drug together ( call maximum tolerate dose ) . Gemcitabine capecitabine two chemotherapy drug use treat pancreatic biliary cancer . These two drug use together consider acceptable standard care pancreatic biliary cancer . However , study dose dose schedule change , hop drug effect few side effect give standard way .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma biliary tract carcinoma ( cholangiocarcinoma gallbladder cancer ) Disease must amenable surgical resection . Patients either locally advanced metastatic disease eligible No prior systemic therapy diagnosis ECOG performance score 01 Evidence either follow : 1 . RECISTdefined measurable disease ( lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20mm use conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan ) 2 . An elevated serum CA199 baseline ( ≥ 2X ULN ) Female patient must either surgically sterile postmenopausal , childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment agree use effective barrier contraception period therapy . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment investigator . Adequate bone marrow function : 1 . ANC ≥ 1500/uL 2. platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL 3. hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Adequate hepatic function : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN 2 . AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN 3 . ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN Adequate renal function determine either : 1 . Calculated measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min ( calculated creatinine clearance , CockroftGault equation use ) 2 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN Ability swallow oral medication Ability understand nature study protocol give write informed consent Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Any prior systemic investigational therapy metastatic locally advanced pancreatic cancer biliary cancer . Systemic therapy administer alone combination radiation adjuvant set permissible long complete &gt; 6 month prior time study enrollment . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition , opinion investigator , render subject high risk treatment complication might affect interpretation result study . Presence central nervous system brain metastasis . Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation . Prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , form cancer patient diseasefree 5 year . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption syndrome . Known , exist uncontrolled coagulopathy . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery .
