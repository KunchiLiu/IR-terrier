	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Safety Transplanting Autologous Skeletal Myoblasts , Into Infarcted Heart , Using Catheter Delivery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given limited treatment option available patient congestive heart failure , need alternative therapy . Autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation demonstrate pre-clinical study safe effective treatment heart failure . Initial clinical study show autologous myoblasts deliver infracted myocardium direct epicardial endomyocardial injection . However , autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation via percutaneous endomyocardial injection potential play significant role congestive heart failure patient without need surgical risk general anesthesia . Thus , Phase 2 clinical trial propose order evaluate effectiveness autologous myoblast deliver endomyocardial injection treatment congestive heart failure .</detailed_description>
