	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control pilot safety study enroll total twenty subject . Subjects adult ( 30-75 ) sustain SAH secondary cerebral aneurysm rupture present minimal neurological symptom . All subject Hemoglobin le equal 12 g/dL within 24 hour prior study entry undergo operative aneurismal clipping . Subjects randomize two group , ten subject receive drug ten subject receive placebo . The subject receive three intravenous injection study drug placebo , undergo operative aneurysmal clipping ( study Day 1 ) two additional day ( study Day 2 study Day 3 ) . There 3 phase trial : Screening Phase - patient present Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) prepped surgery within 36 hour Treatment Phase - first pre-operative dose surgery ( Study Day 1 ) , post-operative ( Study Days 2 3 ) Follow-up Phase- Study Day 4 discharge , 6-7 week follow-up Primary Objective : To determine safety administer intravenous dos Procrit® daily three consecutive day patient aneurysmal SAH vascular clip compare incidence thrombotic event , hemoglobin 6-7 week mortality Procrit® placebo group . Secondary Objectives : To determine administration Procrit® prior aneurysm clip reduces incidence vasospasm follow SAH event treat vascular clipping . To determine Procrit® administration prior aneurysm clip patient Aneurysmal SAH improve neurological assessment score post-SAH/post-clipping time period . To determine feasibility organize large , randomize study explore neuroprotective effect Procrit® patient Aneurysmal SubArachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH ) Procrit® administer prior surgical clip aneurysm . It hypothesize Procrit provide significant level neuroprotection brain SAH event result reduce cell death , well reduced amount vasospasm activity delay cerebral ischemia occur result SAH . These factor may contribute improved neurological functioning score compare placebo treated patient .</brief_summary>
