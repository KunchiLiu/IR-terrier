	<brief_title>Clofarabine Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-myeloablative conditioning allows curative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation patient unable tolerate toxic conventional conditioning regiment . These regiment continue refine evolve . No standard regimen yet agree upon . The incorporation newly license agent Clofarabine non-myeloablative regimen logical give recognize anti-leukemic activity . This study ass safety efficacy Cyclophosphamide Clofarabine promote hematopoietic engraftment allogeneic transplant blood stem cell . Patients eligibility include advanced hematological neoplasm might benefit allogeneic blood cell transplant . Patients must adequate organ function suitable relate unrelated donor transplant . In Phase I study 9-12 patient treat order establish Cyclophosphamide Clofarabine dose , confirm reasonable safety engraftment efficacy . Phase II treat total 20 patient select dose level Clofarabine Cyclophosphamide . Results compare extensive Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center experience use Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide similar patient population . Supportive care , include graft versus host disease prophylaxis similar recently use Hershey Medical Center . Primary endpoint include survival engraftment compare historical result Hershey Medical Center . Disease specific outcomes frequent diagnosis acute leukemia non-hodgkin 's lymphoma assess secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
