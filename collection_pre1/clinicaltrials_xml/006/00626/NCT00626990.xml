	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together temozolomide may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give temozolomide and/or radiation therapy effective radiation therapy alone treat anaplastic glioma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give temozolomide and/or radiation therapy see well work compare radiation therapy alone treat patient anaplastic glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Anaplastic Glioma Without 1p/19q LOH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess whether concurrent radiotherapy daily temozolomide improve overall survival compare daily temozolomide patient non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma . - To assess whether adjuvant temozolomide improve survival compare adjuvant temozolomide patient non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma . Secondary - To assess whether concurrent adjuvant temozolomide prolongs progression-free survival neurological deterioration-free survival patient non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma . - To assess safety concurrent adjuvant temozolomide patient non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma , include late effect cognition . - To assess impact concurrent adjuvant temozolomide quality life patient non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord institution , WHO performance status ( 0 v &gt; 0 ) , age ( ≤ 50 v &gt; 50 ) , presence 1p LOH ( yes v ) , presence oligodendroglial element ( yes v ) , O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status ( methylated vs unmethylated v indeterminate ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy* daily , 5 day week , 6.5 week ( total 33 fraction ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy* daily , 5 day week receive oral temozolomide daily 6.5 week ( total 33 fraction radiotherapy ) . - Arm III : Patients undergo radiotherapy* daily , 5 day week 6.5 week ( total 33 fraction ) . Beginning 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment adjuvant temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course . - Arm IV : Patients undergo radiotherapy* daily , 5 day week receive oral temozolomide daily 6.5 week ( total 33 fraction radiotherapy ) . Beginning 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment adjuvant temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course . NOTE : *Patients must begin radiotherapy within 8 day randomization within 7 week surgery . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire , include QLQ-C30 version 3 , BCM20 , Mini Mental Status Exam baseline , 4 week completion radiotherapy , every 3 month 5 year . Tissue sample collect baseline histology review , 1p/19q analysis , methylation status O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter , isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
