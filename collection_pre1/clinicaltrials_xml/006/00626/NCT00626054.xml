	<detailed_description>Background rationale research Colonoscopy endoscopic examination whereby physician visually inspect interior lining colon . It efficient accurate mean identify , either directly biopsy , neoplasms large intestine inflammatory process , infection , ischemia involve whole colon distal small intestine . In addition , procedure , certain endoscopic treatment may perform , removal precancerous polyp cauterization bleed site vascular malformation electrocoagulation . Proper preparation bowel prior colonoscopy crucial quality examination . Suboptimal preparation adversely affect ability examiner detect abnormality small large intestine carry various endoscopic treatment . In case , poor preparation may necessitate cancel procedure reschedule patient repeat test . To properly clear bowel , patient must strictly adhere special diet drink laxative solution direct . The physician selects specific type laxative solution among currently available basis patient 's age underlying disease . At present , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , owe good safety profile relative lack complication , recommend old patient ( 65 year ) , patient hypertension renal cardiac insufficiency , patient treat diuretic ACE inhibitor . However , major disadvantage PEG difficulty use , involve bad taste drink 3 liter within short period time day examination . Several recent study medical literature report ambulatory patient , divide oral laxative solution 2 dos take different time effective drinking whole amount one session . On basis finding , give quality bowel preparation know poor hospitalized ambulatory patient , seek determine divide laxative dose yield well result hospitalize patient well . It note laxative solution constitute accept method prepare bowel colonoscopy present study , sole difference standard practice method administration , namely single split dose . Aim study The purpose study compare effectiveness ( quality bowel cleanse ) ease use ( patient satisfaction ) two method administration precolonoscopy PEG solution hospitalize patient . Method Study design : Prospective , comparative , randomized End point : Primary - Cleanliness bowel , determine examiner , ease use , determine patient satisfaction questionnaire two study arm Secondary - Effect external factor ( demographic parameter , length hospitalization , procedural diagnosis ) quality bowel preparation . Study sample : Four hundred hospitalized patient schedule colonoscopy examination part in-hospital work-up . Inclusion criterion : Age 18-80 year ; ability understand complete questionnaire ; ability participate stage research . Exclusion criterion : Previous colon surgery , previous endoscopic procedure full anesthesia , know sensitivity PEG solution , terminal renal cardiac insufficiency , inability sign inform consent form Colonoscopy : All patient perform precolonoscopy bowel preparation one two method , accord study design , follow colonoscopy Gastrolenterology Institute Rabin Medical Center Questionnaires : Demographic questionnaire - age , sex , weight , height , year education Patient satisfaction questionnaire - ease preparation relate symptom In addition , physician rate degree bowel visibility procedure standard scale . Study design : The study sample include hospitalize patient schedule colonoscopy . The physician conduct research obtain informed consent candidate study prior enrollment . At onset study , participant complete demographic questionnaire presence member research team . Items include age , sex , height , weight , year education . Study participant randomly divide 2 group . Group 1 receive precolonoscopy PEG solution single dose 3 liter even precede test . Group 2 receive half dose ( 1.5 liter ) identical solution even precede test half ( 1.5 liter ) morning test . The randomization perform Gastroenterology Institute . The secretary Institute inform nurses/attendants various hospitalization department two procedure apply individual patient . Before procedure , patient complete demographic questionnaire presence member research team . The physician performing colonoscopy blind group allocation . After complete colonoscopy , physician rate quality bowel preparation patient 's medical file accord Aronchick scale , follow : Score Description 0 - excellent More 95 % intestine visible 1 . - good Large amount transparent fluid require suction ; 90 % intestine visible 2 . - fair Semisolid stool require suction/flushing ; 90 % intestine visible 3 . - poor Semisolid stool difficult impossible remove ; le 90 % intestine visible 4 . - fail Repeated test require Following procedure , study participant ask rate satisfaction ease use bowel preparation severity symptom relate ( e.g. , stomach pain , nausea ) VAS scale . Colonoscopy method : At time referral colonoscopy , patient receive preliminary explanation test , alternative examination currently available , possible complication test . On day colonoscopy , receive additional explanation attend gastroenterologist , patient ask sign inform consent form . The colonoscopy examination perform patient lie left side ; sedative administer intravenously . During procedure , patient may feel cramp discomfort infusion air colon . The duration examination 30 minute , depend structure colon , amount visibility consequent bowel preparation , degree patient cooperation ; last two factor essential success procedure . The endoscopic device carefully clean sterilized examination accordance routine practice institute accept standard developed country . Statistical analysis On basis report mean standard deviation medical literature , assume 75 % compliance rate type 1 error ( Î± ) 0.05 , study sample 400 hospitalized patient yield statistical power 80 % . The sample divide two treatment group use computerized Research Randomizer 2007 ( http : //www.randomizer.org/ ) Independent test use compare mean continuous variable two group , chi-square test use compare proportion . Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test use analyze level preparation bowel cleanliness , rank ordinal scale , group . All test two-sided ; statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . All analysis perform SPSS software , version 15 .

Schedule The study plan two-year period : Patient enrollment mid-2009 Data collection analysis end 2008-beginning 2009 Ethics Patient anonymity maintain .</detailed_description>
