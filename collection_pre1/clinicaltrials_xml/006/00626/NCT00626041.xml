To address gap , A-CHAMP ( Airdrie Community Hypertension Awareness Management Program ) successfully pilot Airdrie , community 20,000 north Calgary , Alberta . Trained volunteer hold BP screen session senior local pharmacy refer hypertensive participant GP 's trained pharmacist blood pressure management . Of 408 screened participant ( 40 % Airdrie senior ) , 36.5 % uncontrolled HBP . By program end , systolic BP decrease 16.8 mm ( +/- 14.6 . P &lt; .05 ) 56.2 % hypertensive participant reach 2006 Canadian Hypertension Guideline target . Airdrie hold annual blood pressure screening organize run volunteer , demonstrate sustainability approach population screen risk factor management setting . In order fully realize benefit cardiovascular risk reduction , U-CHAMP expand include global risk assessment management protocol include assessment dyslipidemias diabetes urban set . The purpose project : - To expand rural scope A-CHAMP large urban setting ( Calgary ) . - To include global risk assessment ( coronary artery disease stroke ) management include : cholesterol ( total HDL cholesterol ) diabetes ( capillary HgA1c appropriate ) . - To effect fully sustainable practice change management hypertension , diabetes dyslipidemias establish collaborative partnership pharmacist , Calgary Health Region ( CHR ) physician ( Primary Care Networks : PCN 's ) , CHR Chronic Disease Management Program ( CDM ) , select hypertensive patient . Components U-CHAMP follow : - Screening Clinics : - Visit 1 : The pharmacist determine participant diabetes performs BP assessment use BpTRU device ( VSM MedTech , Vancouver , BC ) .

The participant 's BP , random capillary Total HDL cholesterol HgA1c ( appropriate ) measure . Their current medication list confirm adherence information review record .
