	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , basiliximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give chemotherapy , radiation therapy , vaccine therapy together basiliximab effective treatment glioblastoma multiforme chemotherapy , radiation therapy , vaccine therapy alone . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study side effect best way give chemotherapy radiation therapy follow vaccine therapy basiliximab treat patient glioblastoma multiforme remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine basiliximab inhibits functional numeric recovery T-regulatory cell ( Tregs ) therapeutic temozolomide ( TMZ ) -induced lymphopenia context vaccinate adult patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) use PEPvIII-keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) . Secondary - To evaluate safety basiliximab context vaccinate adult patient newly diagnose GBM use PEP-3-KLH conjugate vaccine recovery therapeutic TMZ-induced lymphopenia . - To determine basiliximab enhances magnitude character PEPvIII-KLH-induced cellular humoral immune response , inhibits enhances activation-induced cell death , induce immunologic clinical evidence autoimmunity . - To determine basiliximab enhances magnitude character PEPvIII-KLH-induced cellular humoral immune response , inhibits enhances activation-induced cell death , induce immunologic clinical evidence autoimmunity . - To determine basiliximab alters phenotype ( CD56-expression ) , cytokine secretion profile , cytotoxicity CD3-negative CD56-positive natural killer cell . - To determine basiliximab , addition vaccination , extend progression-free survival compare historical cohort . - To characterize immunologic cell infiltrate recurrent tumor seek evidence antigen escape outgrowth . OUTLINE : - Leukapheresis : Patients undergo leukapheresis 2-4 hour immunologic monitoring . - Concurrent standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive external-beam radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 6-7 week ( 33 fraction ) concurrent temozolomide mouth 7 day week 49 day begin first day continue last day radiotherapy . - Temozolomide PEP-3-KLH conjugate vaccine : Approximately 3 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive temozolomide mouth day 1-21 , day 1-5 depend treat neuro-oncologist , basiliximab IV 30 minute day 21 , PEP-3-KLH conjugate vaccine intradermally day 21 , 35 , 49 . Patients receive second course temozolomide mouth day 1-21 day 1-5 , depend treat neuro-oncologist . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 4 week 5 additional course . Patients also receive PEP-3-KLH conjugate vaccine day 21 remain temozolomide course . Patients receive vaccine monthly disease progression . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically laboratory study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
