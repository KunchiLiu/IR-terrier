	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Paclitaxel design block mechanism cell division cancer cell , may cause die . Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block effect Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , blood-vessel stimulating agent play important role growth normal abnormal blood vessel . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day study `` cycle '' , receive paclitaxel needle vein 1 hour . On Days 1 15 cycle , receive bevacizumab vein . The first dose bevacizumab give 90 minute . If first dose well tolerate , second dose may give 60 minute . If well tolerate , third dos may give 30 minute . Before receive study drug , receive premedication ( select doctor ) help prevent lessen side effect study drug . Study Visits : About every 4 week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test blood clot . - You ask experienced side effect . About every 8 week , chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen pelvis check status disease . Length Study : You may stay study long benefitting . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : After go study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test possibly blood clot test . - You CT MRI abdomen pelvis check status disease . - You ask experienced side effect . This investigational study . Paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer , nonsmall cell lung cancer , ovarian cancer , treatment AIDS-related Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available use combination chemotherapy patient colon cancer , use combination type cancer consider experimental . Up 20 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
