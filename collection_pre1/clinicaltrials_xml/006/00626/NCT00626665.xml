	<brief_title>Randomised Control Trial Assess Efficacy Tadalafil Raynaud 's Phenomenon Scleroderma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Raynaud 's syndrome , first describe Maurice Raynaud 1862 , define episodic cold emotional stress-triggered ischemic vasospasms digital artery precapillary arteriole . This phenomenon affect 95 % systemic sclerosis ( SScl ) patient may lead superficial ulceration severe case even result deep tissue necrosis gangrene . Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) symptom generalise vasculopathy SScl , eventually lead fibroproliferative arteriopathy . Pulmonary artery hypertension one many serious sequela process . Nonpharmacological therapy include avoidance cold temperature , emotional stress , smoking . Pharmacological therapy vasodilator calcium channel blocker , alpha adrenergic receptor blocker , angiotensin II receptor antagonists agent use . Effects treatment , however , often inadequate.1 Sildenafil selective inhibitor cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 . Besides establish effect erectile dysfunction , sildenafil provide cGMP-dependent microvascular macrovascular dilation , furthermore , recently show exhibit antiproliferative effects.2 There study literature efficacy sildenafil Raynaud 's disease.3-5 It show study case report sildenafil may useful RP . The limitation sildenafil short t1/2 ( 4 hour ) . Tadalafil selective long act ( 17 hour ) analogue sildenafil.6 These PDE 5 inhibitor show improve endothelial function diabetic subject cold induce vasospasm.7 It well know fact endothelial dysfunction one major pathogenetic mechanism scleroderma8 . There randomise control trial efficacy tadalafil RP . There one study show beneficial effect Tadalafil cold induce vasoconstriction pateints Raynaud 's phenomenon9 . So designed study ass effect tadalafil Raynauds phenomenon endothelial dysfunction scleroderma . We hypothesise tadalafil improve Raynaud 's phenomenon endothelial dysfunction scleroderma patient act disease-modifying agent . Patients systemic , scleroderma enrol . Study Protocol In double-blinded , placebo-controlled , fixed-dose , study patient randomly assign take placebo 20 mg tadalafil thrice weekly 6 week . After 6 week wash period 2 week observe two group switch receive drug . We plan priori include 30 patient . The concomitant medication treatment rheumatic disease remain unchanged whole study . Patient undergo clinical lab evaluation organ damage kidney lung . ECHO heart do base line ass PAH LV function repeat end study . Blood pressure record visit . A physician unaware treatment group record skin score appearance new cutaneous ulcer . The primary outcome variable frequency duration Raynaud 's attack , evolution trophic digital lesion change flow mediate dilatation brachial artery . Flow mediate dilatation brachial artery do baseline 6 12 week . Clinical Evaluation Symptoms Raynaud 's phenomenon assess diary card . When attack occur , patient immediately record event duration diary . At end day , patient give overall estimation last 24 hour , use 10-point Raynaud 's Condition Score ( 0 point - subject felt handicapped Raynauds attack ; 10 point - subject felt extremely handicap ) validate describe elsewhere . Local Temperature record separate column diary daily . Assessment cutaneous digital tip ulcers/ infarct : The number position cutaneous digital tip ulcer infarct finger record . Data ulcer infarct collect . Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) : The HAQ self-administered instrument measure physical disability 8 domain function : dressing/grooming , arise , eat , walk , hygiene , reach , grip , activity . A visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain also part HAQ . The result 8 subscales , composite disability score , pain measurement report 0-3 scale . The HAQ use extensively study rheumatoid arthritis also validate patient scleroderma . Levels circulate soluble marker endothelial cell function , include soluble isoforms endothelin 1 ( ET-1 ) , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide ( PINP ) measure 0 12 week Statistics Students T test apply continuous variable whereas chi square test apply categorical variable . From analysis daily record sheet , Following calculate : ( ) total average daily duration attack ( TADDA ) , obtain divide total duration min attack give three -week interval ( observation period ) number diary day ; ( ii ) average duration single attack ( ADSA ) , divide overall duration number attack observation period ; ( iii ) average daily frequency attack ( ADFA ) , divide total number attack interval consider ( 3 week ) number diary day ; ( iv ) severity attack , measure visual analogical scale ; designate Raynaud 's condition score ( RCS ) calculate arithmetic average daily score interval consider ( 3weeks ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 year 60 year select study clinical diagnosis Raynaud 's phenomenon secondary systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) . Raynaud 's phenomenon define history cold sensitivity associate colour change cyanosis pallor , well history least 4 attack per week two pretrial period even treatment vasodilator . The diagnosis scleroderma define American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion presence least 3 5 feature CREST syndrome ( calcinosis , Raynaud 's phenomenon , esophageal dysmotility , sclerodactyly , telangiectasias ) . Patients exclude : Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension Evidence current malignancy History sympathectomy Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis lymphedema within 3 month Recent surgical procedure require general anesthesia AMI , unstable angina , stroke TIA within past three month Smoking Use investigational drug within 30 day study session Use medication might interfere tadalafil like nitrate alpha adrenergic blocker vasoactive effect , patient take potent inhibitor CYP3A4 ritonavir , ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , itraconazole , grapefruit juice Patients take alcohol Patients bleed disorder Significant active peptic ulceration Current pregnancy Current breastfeeding</criteria>
