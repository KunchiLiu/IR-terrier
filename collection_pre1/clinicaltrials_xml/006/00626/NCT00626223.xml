	<brief_summary>A randomized prospective study do determine whether i.v . 5-methyltetrahydrofolate vs oral folate improve survival ESRD patient . Homocysteine , CRP , Lp ( ) , albumin , folate , vitamin B6 B12 check . The 5-MTHF treated group associate lower C reactive protein high survival folate treat group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Hemodialysis patient show 20-fold increase CVD mortality comparison general population . Although hyperhomocysteinemia implicate important independent risk factor general population2 , well ESRD patient , several study question benefit lowering homocysteine ESRD patient . Paradoxically , two recent study show patient low homocysteine plasma level bad outcomes include high incidence hospitalization mortality . This raise question whether elevated homocysteine uremic patient consequential rather causal role cardiovascular complication . Despite uncertainty , many ESRD pre-ESRD patient receive treatment low homocysteine . Elevated homocysteine frequently report ESRD patient prevalence range 85 100 % . There two basic strategy use low homocysteine . Both attempt increase level biologically active folate essential remethylation pathway homocysteine metabolism via active metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5-MTHF ) , thus lower homocysteine efflux tissue plasma compartment . The first , common approach , oral administration folic acid . Folic acid biologically active , however stable folate , often use tablet food fortification . The second approach supplement 5-MTHF , natural circulate form folate . In addition folate , vitamin B6 vitamin B12 necessary co-factors homocysteine metabolism . ESRD patient often resistant homocysteine lower administration folic acid 5-MTHF . Although supplementation folic acid , B6 B12 usually decrease homocysteine patient vascular disease , often remain elevated ESRD patient despite supplementation folic acid , B6 B12 . Several study report moderate effect , even high dos folic acid ( 15 mg/daily ) . AIM OF THE STUDY The aim study investigate whether supplementation 5MTHF vs. folic acid treatment affect patient survival . Homocysteine blood level MTHFR genetic polymorphism also evaluate determine consider independent cardiovascular risk factor . STUDY DESIGN Single center , randomise , prospective study . Two group stable ESRD patient treat intravenous 5-MTHF 5 mg per day oral folic acid . Patient selection Period selection : 4 year Start selection : 1 January 1998 End selection : 30 June 2001 Follow-up : 55 month .
