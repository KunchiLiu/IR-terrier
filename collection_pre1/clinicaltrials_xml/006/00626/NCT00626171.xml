	<brief_summary>The objective study determine effect cigarette smoke inflammatory cell recruitment lung allergen challenge , non-smoking currently smoke mild asthmatic subject . When compare non-smoking asthmatic smoke asthmatic , differential cell count obtain inflammatory cell induce sputum allergen challenge differ ? Will differential cell count show decline inflammatory cell induce sputum asthmatic refrain smoke eight week ? This study randomize , case-controlled study . The first part study require smoke non-smoking subject attend 2 study period 3 consecutive day ( triad ) . In triad , challenge allergen diluent inhalation , random order , triad separate washout period . In second part study , current smoker invite undergo another allergen challenge 8 week smoke cessation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>10 non-smoking adult subject 10 smoke adult subject mild atopic asthma study . Part 1 : On first study day triad , subject undergo screen procedure , include complete history physical examination . Methacholine inhalation challenge allergen skin titration perform determine concentration allergen require inhalation . Sputum induce baseline measurement airway inflammatory cell . On second day , subject inhale allergen diluent randomize order , spirometry measure next 7 hour . Sputum collect 7 hour challenge . On third day , subject report lab 24 hour allergen/diluent inhalation challenge . Sputum cell collect measure percentage airway inflammatory cell , include eosinophil neutrophil . After washout 2-4 week , subject return undergo diluent/allergen triad . Part 2 : Asthmatic smoker study investigate allergen-induced change inflammatory cell number quit smoke period 8 week . Asthmatic smoker involve first part study ask would like participate part study , provide smoke cessation tool include nicorette gum nicotine patch , aid cease smoke . At begin study period , procedure occur part 1 perform obtain initial baseline results- ie- history , physical examination , skin prick test , methacholine challenge sputum induction . Throughout 8 week period , subject require come weekly perform carboxyhemoglobin test , ensure smoke week . At end 8 week period , allergen challenge triad carry ( perform Part 1 study ) . Those subject able comply smoke cessation regime still include final measurement . We hypothesize inflammatory cell count high asthmatic smoker versus asthmatic non-smokers . We also hypothesize subject quit smoke 8 week period show decline inflammatory cell count indicate improvement lung function . We believe result novel study provide great insight inflammatory response asthmatic smoker , suggest appropriate therapeutic approach control asthma smoker .</detailed_description>
