	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , basiliximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving treatment together may kill tumor cell . Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) powerful adjuvant capable stimulating macrophage function , induce proliferation maturation DCs , able enhance T-lymphocyte stimulatory function . Intradermal administration GM-CSF enhance immunization efficacy site administration PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well basiliximab work treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme temozolomide-caused lymphopenia undergoing target immunotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine basiliximab inhibits functional numeric recovery T-regulatory cell therapeutic temozolomide ( TMZ ) -induced lymphopenia context vaccinate adult patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) use cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein ( LAMP ) mRNA-loaded dendritic cell ( DCs ) GM-CSF patient seropositive seronegative CMV . Secondary - To evaluate safety basiliximab patient . - To determine basiliximab enhances magnitude character pp65-specific vaccine-induced cellular humoral immune response , inhibits enhances activation-induced cell death , induce immunologic clinical evidence autoimmunity . - To determine basiliximab alters phenotype ( CD56 expression ) , cytokine secretion profile , cytotoxicity CD3-CD56+ natural killer cell . - To determine basiliximab addition vaccination extend progression-free survival compare historical cohort . - To characterize immunologic cell infiltrate recurrent tumor seek evidence antigen-escape outgrowth . OUTLINE : Patients undergo leukapheresis generation dendritic cell ( DCs ) resection . After initial leukapheresis , patient undergo stereotactic radiotherapy ( RT ) day 1-5 concurrent temozolomide ( TMZ ) IV day 1-7 6.5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3 week completion RT , patient receive TMZ IV day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . On day 14 ± 2 day first cycle TMZ , patient receive basiliximab , 7 day ( ± 2 day ) DC vaccine # 1 2 week later , second dose basiliximab give , also 7 day vaccine # 2 . All patient undergo leukapheresis DC generation immunologic monitoring specific assessment baseline antigen-specific cellular humoral immune response 3 + 1 week vaccine # 3 . Patients treat monthly TMZ cycle total 12 cycle . On day 21 ± 2 day TMZ cycle , patient receive monthly vaccine total 8 vaccine . Patients blood draw immunologic monitoring basiliximab infusion prior vaccine 1 , 2 , 3 , prior monthly vaccine bimonthly TMZ cycle without receive prescribed antitumor therapy progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
