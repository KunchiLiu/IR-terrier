	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving everolimus together combination chemotherapy and/or panitumumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together fluorouracil , leucovorin , panitumumab , oxaliplatin treat patient solid tumor respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose everolimus combination sequential fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) leucovorin calcium , panitumumab , modify 5-FU , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFOX6 ) , mFOLFOX6 panitumumab patient refractory solid tumor . Secondary - To determine adverse event profile regimen . - To correlate response S6-phosphorylation AKT-phosphorylation available archive tumor sample . - To evaluate preliminary evidence antitumor activity regimens use RECIST criterion subset patient measurable disease . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Cohorts patient enrol treatment group 1 2 . If final cohort patient reach group 1 and/or 2 , additional cohort patient enrol treatment group 3 . - Group 1 : Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 : Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 panitumumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 3 : Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 , leucovorin calcium IV follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 , oxaliplatin IV 2-4 hour day 1 . Some patient may also receive panitumumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor sample assess phospho-AKT , phospho-S6K , phospho-S6 immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
