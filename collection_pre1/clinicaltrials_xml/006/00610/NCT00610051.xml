	<detailed_description>During Screening Phase , inform consent obtain information establish eligibility transplant inclusion exclusion criterion assess . The screening activity may perform outpatient basis stable patient inpatient unstable patient already hospitalize . Throughout study , patient maintain medically accordance national Guidelines heart failure , mostly base European Guidelines Heart Failure ( 2005 ) American Guidelines Heart Failure , The primary assessment efficacy base number day patient hospitalize deceased 24 week follow day randomization , As elective transplantation bias donor availability , observation period case count ELECTIVE heart transplantation . Additional surrogate measure efficacy include monthly assessment Nt-proBNP , patient assessment dyspnoea , Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire , NYHA classification , use beta1-blocker therapy . Study Population It plan sufficient number patient screen enroll 500 patient ( 250 patient per treatment group ) . Compliance inclusion exclusion criterion outline must establish prior randomization double-blind therapy .</detailed_description>
