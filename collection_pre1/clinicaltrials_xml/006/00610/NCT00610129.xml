	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new drug neuroendocrine tumor . We think new drug may help control tumor . MK-0646 monoclonal antibody . An antibody protein able attach specific target cancer cell . This target help cancer cell grow divide . By attach target , may stop cancer cell growth divide . This study help find MK-0646 helpful drug take patient neuroendocrine tumor . This study phase 2 study . The purpose phase 2 study find effect , good and/or bad , MK-0646 metastatic neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm metastatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) Patients must histologically cytologically confirm well differentiate ( low intermediate grade ) neuroendocrine tumor . High grade poorly differentiate ( i.e. , large small cell variant ) , Merkel cell , medullary carcinoma thyroid , adrenal gland malignancy ( include paragangliomas ) exclude study . Patient least one measurable lesion great equal 20 mm great 10 mm spiral CT . Patients therapy somatostatin analogue eligible entry must stable dose least 3 month evidence tumor shrinkage time period . Patient male female . Patient ≥ equal 18 year age day sign informed consent . Patient performance status 02 ECOG Performance Scale . Patient adequate organ function indicate follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ equal 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ equal 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ equal 8 g/dL Serum Creatinine ≤ equal 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) / OR calculate CrCl ≥ equal 60 mL/min ( patient creatinine level ≥ equal 2 time ULN ) . Patient may dialysis Serum total bilirubin ≤ equal 1.5 time ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ equal 5 time ULN Prothrombin time ( PT ) Partial Thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ equal 1.2 time ULN ≤than equal 1.2 time ULN Creatinine clearance calculate CockcroftGault method follow : Male creatinine clearance = ( 140age ) x ( weight Kg ) / ( serum Cr x 72 ) Female creatinine clearance = ( ( 140 age ) x ( weight Kg ) / ( serum Cr x 72 ) ) x 0.85 Patient , patient 's legal representative , voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent . Previous local therapy ( e.g . chemoembolization bland embolization ) allow complete &gt; 6 week prior study entry . For patient receive local therapy prior study entry , must either document growth measurable disease within embolization field outside embolization field , , prior study entry area embolization field site measurable disease . Previous chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or biologic therapy , include investigational agent , is/are allow complete &gt; 4 week prior study entry ( &gt; 6 week last regimen contain BCNU mitomycin C , &gt; 6 week last dose radiation therapy radiopharmaceutical . Patients must disease currently amenable curative surgery . Prior surgery allow less 6 week prior study entry . Patients diabetes mellitus eligible study entry must control diabetes define hemoglobin A1c &lt; 8.0 % within 2 week initiation protocol therapy . Patient toxicity prior therapy resolve grade 1 grade 0 . Patient known CNS metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Patient known primary central nervous system tumor . Patient known hypersensitivity component study drug ( MK0646 ) analogs treatable premedication antihistamine steroid . Patient condition , include limited , serious active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , serious cardiac arrhythmia , major psychiatric illness , , opinion treat investigator , likely confound result study , make participation best interest patient . Patient history prior active malignancy within past 5 year , exception cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ; basal cell carcinoma skin , adequately treat localized prostate carcinoma PSA &lt; 1.0 , squamous cell carcinoma skin remove ( superficial keratoacanthoma ) . Patient know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would , opinion treat investigator , interfere cooperation requirement trial . Patient breastfeeding pregnant ( require negative test within 72 hour initiation therapy ) , expect conceive within project duration study . Patient use adequate contraception .
