	<brief_summary>The study do understand patient epilepsy ( disease recurrence seizure ) respond well drug treatment anticonvulsant . Despite availability many anticonvulsant , 30 % patient epilepsy resistant . The cause resistance clear , one reason could increase amount protein cell body call transporter protein . Transporter proteins group proteins help defend body toxin , include drug , pump cell . Studies show number transporter proteins high part brain trigger seizure compare part brain . Studies animal show take anticonvulsant inhibitor ( mean `` stop '' `` reduce '' ) transporter protein increase concentration anticonvulsant inside brain cell . The main purpose study determine take anticonvulsant transporter protein inhibitor change brain concentration anticonvulsant . In study , single dose phenytoin ( DilantinÂ® brand name anticonvulsant phenytoin active ingredient ) , commonly use anticonvulsant , give , give separate time single ( i.e . one time ) dose probenecid . Probenecid , medicine use commonly treat gout ( disease increase uric acid ) , know inhibitor transporter protein . The study use electroencephalogram EEG ( record brain wave activity ) determine EEG pattern probenecid give , different EEG pattern phenytoin give alone . This suggest probenecid affect brain concentration phenytoin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Transporter Protein Inhibitor Probenecid In Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 30 % patient epilepsy refractory medical treatment ( pharmacoresistant epilepsy ) . The cause multifactorial . Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) cause decreased uptake medicine tissue . MDR occur overexpression family transporter proteins act physiological defense mechanism pump toxins cell . Two group transporter , P-glycoprotein ( PGP ) multidrug resistance-associated protein ( MRP ) , important gatekeeper blood brain barrier . PGP MRP overexpressed brain tissue pharmacoresistant patient partial epilepsy many antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) substrates PGP , MRP . It logical try apply observation clinical practice . We hope co-administration inhibitor transporter protein , increase CNS concentration AEDs , subsequently improve seizure control . However , , critical demonstrate transporter protein inhibitor increase concentration AEDs human brain . Probenecid MRP inhibitor phenytoin MRP substrate . Evaluating whether probenecid increase CNS concentration PHT potentially achieve noninvasively use pharmaco-EEG . We plan estimate effect probenecid ( transporter protein inhibitor ) quantitative EEG recording administer patient pharmacoresistant epilepsy normal healthy volunteer . We plan recruit two group 10 subject , normal volunteer patient pharmacoresistant epilepsy . They undergo two treatment regimen ; EEG record administration intravenous phenytoin pre-dosing probenecid .</detailed_description>
