	<brief_title>Digital Colposcopy Finding Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Patients With An Abnormal Pap Smear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify potential improvement noninvasive method diagnose cervical dysplasia neoplasia use Multispectral Digital Colposcope ( MDC ) , device us fluorescence reflectance spectroscopy compare image histopathologic map cervical epithelium . - To measure MDC image vivo cervix use modified device make measurement second rather 2 minute acetic acid . - To evaluate , preliminarily , effect fade acetic acid image contrast obtain time see fading predict grade intraepithelial neoplasia . - To evaluate mapping cervix software reconstruct cervical epithelial map compare map routine colposcopic image well MDC . - To compare , preliminarily , MDC performance colposcopy pathologic analysis tissue remove colposcopy form loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo routine colposcopy part regular colposcopic evaluation . The digital colposcope use take image vagina cervix , pre- post-acetic acid , use white , green , blue light . Colposcopically abnormal area biopsied ; normal area may also biopsied . Patients undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) may undergo one additional biopsy colposcopically normal site .</detailed_description>
