	<detailed_description>Twenty ( 20 ) patient enrol three -period crossover , randomize study design . During course study , patient treat test article clinic separate visit . Following informed consent procedure , general ocular evaluation , include corneal conjunctival staining , Schirmer testing , evaporometry assessment complete determine baseline tear evaporation rate . This occur test article administer patient . Qualified patient randomize three treatment group . After 1 hour , order eliminate residual sodium fluorescein , patient administer one drop Systane® ( 40 µl ) , Optive™ ( 40 µl ) , Soothe™ ( 40 µl ) eye per randomization assignment . At 30 60 minute follow instillation drop , evaporometry measurement repeat . These test ( pre post instillation drop ) perform order establish comparison later analysis . The estimated time complete visit 180 minute per visit . Patients ask return clinic 2 - 14 day evaluation 2nd 3rd assigned treatment . During interim study period , patient ask continue pre-study routine ; use pre-study ocular lubricant tear product frequency . Any change frequency product use interim period change concomitant medication carefully record . This especially important since many prescription product ( e.g. , Claritan ) significant effect lacrimal gland physiology . An effort make schedule study visit approximately time day order reduce diurnal variability . For similar reason , patient ask use lubricant ocular medication prior one hour office visit .</detailed_description>
