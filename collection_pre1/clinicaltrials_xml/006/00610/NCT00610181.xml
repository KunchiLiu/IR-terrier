	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn often magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast locate additional area cancer breast patient lobular cancer well breast young breast cancer patient ( less age 40 year ) . Researchers also hope learn often result MRI change type surgical treatment recommend understand cost associate use MRI diagnostic process . Researchers also want use different way look MRI scan learn easily learn difference cyst tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At MD Anderson , patient breast cancer routinely mammograms ultrasounds measure size extent cancer . MRI breast technology well mammogram ultrasounds locate cancer . Although MRI may locate area cancer , sometimes falsely identify normal area breast cancerous . Unlike ductal cancer breast ( common type breast cancer ) , lobular cancer difficult see mammograms ultrasound . Therefore , patient lobular cancer breast may best suit MRI breast order accurately determine extent cancer . In addition , young woman , breast tissue dense , type breast tumor harder detect mammogram ultrasound may better see MRI . A correct measurement size extent cancer important affect recommendation type surgery patient may . Study Procedures : If agree take part study , MRI breast . For MRI , part body pass long , narrow tube scanner , open end . The MRI image compare image standard care mammogram ultrasound image . If MRI show abnormality see mammogram ultrasound doctor think necessary , may additional test and/or tumor biopsy . This part standard care . The result additional MRI testing use surgeon guide his/her recommendation surgery . Information like age , diagnosis , result test collected part data analysis study . No identify information send outside MD Anderson . Your information store password-protected computer . Information may keep 5 year study end . This investigational study . The investigational part study comparison outcome MRI image mammogram ultrasound image determine appropriate surgical therapy . Up 170 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
