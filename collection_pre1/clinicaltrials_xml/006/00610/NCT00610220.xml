	<brief_title>Cast Versus Splint Children With Acceptably Angulated Wrist Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acceptability angulate wrist bone fracture child carry excellent long-term prognosis unique capacity skeletally immature bone heal via remodel . Their management varies widely virtually scientific evidence support one treatment modality another . Importantly , common treatment modality cast application four six week associate many inconvenience . There commercially available wrist splint offer convenient alternative . Wrist splint likely comparable immobilization symptom relief , simultaneously allow easy bath less reliance subspeciality care . Preliminary adult evidence suggest , comparable adult fracture , splint may offer safe alternative casting , early resumption usual activity . However , treatment modality need compare traditional casting management pediatric population recommend clinical practice . This study first challenge current practice routine cast compare commercially available wrist splint respect recovery physical function child acceptably angulate wrist fracture . In addition , standardize treatment fracture splint may associate low morbidity , reduce use health care resource , potential cost saving . This study compare , skeletally immature child , functional outcome result treatment prefabricate wrist splint versus short arm cast acceptably angulate distal radius fracture . Secondly , cost-effectiveness splint relative cast evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Skeletally immature child . 2 . Children must bone age ≥ 5 year age . 3 . Less equal 15° angulation sagittal plane ≤ 0.5 cm displacement frontal plane . Therefore , skeletally immature child ≥ 5 year bone age ≤ 11 year present ED HSC acute distal metaphyseal radius +/ ulnar fracture meet criterion acceptable angulation displacement eligible enrollment . 1 . Age &lt; 5 year &gt; 12 2 . The following diagnosis distal radius fracture : buckle fracture , growth plate fracture kind , distal radius metaphyseal fracture great 15° angulation sagittal plane and/or 0.5 cm displacement frontal plane . 3 . All open fracture require surgical debridement . 4 . All child risk pathological fracture congenital acquire generalized bony disease . Stricter immobilization different prognosis may applicable population .</criteria>
