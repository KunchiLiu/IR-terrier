	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) extremely common disorder U.S population , affect somewhere 9-22 % base community base study . IBS chronic relapse course overlap functional gastrointestinal disorder . It account high direct medical expense indirect cost include significant degree absenteeism . Most study suggest slight predominance among woman , especially suffered form physical sexual trauma . It estimate 25-40 % patient see gastroenterologist ' affected IBS , 70-90 % patient may psychiatric comorbidity , commonly major depression panic disorder , also include schizophrenia , double depression , dysthymia alcohol abuse . Abdominal pain disturbance bowel habit characterize symptom IBS absence demonstrable structural pathology . The diagnosis IBS rely upon clinical criterion alone , `` gold standard '' laboratory finding . The diagnosis dependent upon identify characteristic symptom , differentiate IBS structural bowel disorder . Previously , diagnosis IBS base upon consortium recommendation examine define diagnostic criterion 100 functional gastrointestinal disorder . These criterion become definitive area functional disorder refer Rome Criteria . During time since consensus , criterion modify , 1999 become foundation second set diagnostic criterion consensus , refer Rome II criterion . The revise Rome II criterion include first part original criterion , require presence two three symptom relate abdominal pain bowel symptom . We design study Randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled 12-week study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Secondary Efficacy Measures Primary Change baseline : • Mean composite pain score ( IVRS ) Secondary Change baseline : - Associated symptom IBS ( diarrhea , constipation , incomplete emptying , etc . ) score - IBS Quality Life score - Clinical Global Impression score 1 2 - Beck Depression Inventory II - Beck Anxiety Inventory Safety Measures Safety tolerability assess : - Recording spontaneous adverse event throughout screen , run-in , treatment phase study - Conducting DOTES define point study All subject withdraw study follow complete resolution adverse event . Study Schedule This placebo-controlled , double-blinded prospective 12-week study examine efficacy paroxetine extend release form patient IBS . Patients meet Rome II criterion IBS recruit Duke University Medical Center Division Gastroenterology community . Patients find satisfy criterion refer enrollment study . The study explain informed consent obtain . A detailed history gastrointestinal symptom physical exam perform . Laboratory evaluation ( CBC , chemistry , fecal occult blood , urinalysis EKG ) obtain . All patient undergo MINI baseline diagnose comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorder , physical sexual abuse history elicit . The patient 1 week symptom chart use Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) measure baseline severity IBS symptom . Following , patient receive single-blind placebo 1 week period . Those patient &gt; 25 % improvement composite pain score end placebo week CGI 1 2 terminate study . Following 1 week single-blind placebo lead-in , non-responders randomize active drug placebo additional period 12 week . The patient continue fill daily symptom diary use IVRS , addition , weekly visit ( biweekly week 4 ) ass symptom , side-effects , improvement entire 12-week double-blind period . Those active treatment group receive dos Paxil CR increments 12.5 mg daily first week increase 12.5 mg increment visit week maximum 50 mg daily , determine investigator . The investigator adjust dosage base clinical response . Following completion double-blind phase , patient placebo non-responders study drug taper study drug back 0 2 week , refer Primary Care Physician , Internist Gastroenterologist prescribe treatment Irritable Bowel Syndrome . Patients active drug ( Paroxetine CR ) successful responder double-blind phase eligible continue open label Paxil CR additional period 6 month plus 2 week follow monthly basis . They complete IVRS symptom diary week follow-up month additional 6 month . Those complete double-blind phase 1st half month ( day 1-14 ) complete IVRS symptom diary first week begin 1st next month ; complete double-blind phase second half month ( day 15-31 ) complete IVRS symptom diary first week begin 1st month follow next month . At end 6-month period , study medication patient taper back 0 2 week , refer Primary Care Physician , Internist Gastroenterologist prescribe treatment Irritable Bowel Syndrome . Placebo responders double-blind phase eligible enter 6-month open label maintenance phase . Clinical response measure several way . Abdominal pain severity measure ordinal scale rat 1-9 ( 1=mild pain/discomfort , 9=very severe pain/discomfort ) . Abdominal pain frequency measure four-point scale ( 1=pain discomfort present occasionally , 2=pain discomfort present less half day , 3= pain discomfort present half day , 4=pain discomfort almost day ) . The ordinal scale use quantify distress discomfort cause feeling incomplete evacuation , bloat abdominal discomfort , general level stress tension . Sample Size Computation Power Analysis Power considerations The calculation follow compute current design anticipate difference pre-and post-treatment mean composite pain score ( IVRS ) 25 % ( i.e . reduction score 100 75 ) . The mean standard deviation computation rely previous open-label study paroxetine citalopram IBS . Assuming strong effect size ( 0.5 ) primary variable ( mean composite pain score ) alpha set 0.05 , project sample size 50 detect main effect power great 0.95 . If low effect size assume ( 0.4 ) , project sample size 55 detect main effect power approximately 0.94 . Note power may reduce attrition sample ( i.e . dropout ) also may limit test secondary hypothesis stratification sample may necessary ( i.e . data examine separately men woman ) It may appropriate sample size 60 allow 20 % attrition rate still detect effect size 0.4 primary variable treatment-completer group power great 90 . Statistical analyse The study 's main hypothesis paroxetine ( Paxil CR ) treatment effective placebo reduce symptom IBS . All statistical test two side 0.05 level significance . Descriptive statistic use provide profile demographic outcome measure . Pearson product moment correlational analysis conduct examine relationship among variable . Baseline assessment two group compare use chi square categorical variable independent test ( two tail ) continuous variable . Between group ( medication/placebo ) comparison primary secondary variable employ analysis variance ( ANOVA ) repeat measure . Assessments take baseline end week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 . Within group analyse ( pre end-of-treatment ) employ two tailed test . To control possibility current psychopathology might affect subject respond interview self-report instrument otherwise modulate treatment effect , distribution BDI-II BAI score life time Axis I diagnose placebo control group examine . The potential influence unequally distribute variable control via analyses-of covariance ( ANCOVA ) use unequally distribute variable covariates . After primary analysis exploratory analysis conduct test potential hypothesis study .</detailed_description>
