	<brief_summary>Objective : Although high comorbidity depressive and/or anxiety disorder fibromyalgia , information clinical implication comorbidity limit . We investigate whether history depressive and/or anxiety disorder associate response treatment double blind , randomize , placebo control trial paroxetine control release ( CR ) fibromyalgia . Method : One hundred sixteen fibromyalgia subject randomize receive paroxetine CR ( dose 12.5-62.5 mg/day ) placebo 12 week . The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I-plus ) use ascertain current past diagnosis depressive anxiety disorder . Patients current depressive anxiety disorder exclude , past diagnosis enrol trial . Subjective depression anxiety assess use Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) ; subject exclude score great 23 BDI . Health Status determine use 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) , Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) , Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) . The primary outcome treatment response define â‰¥ 25 % reduction Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) score . Secondary outcome include change score Clinical Global Impression-Severity Improvement ( CGI-S CGI-I respectively ) , Visual Analogue Scale Pain ( VAS ) score number tender point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Despite skepticism physician existence condition call Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , agree common condition see pain clinic . The syndrome characterized widespread pain ( 1 ) persistent fatigue ( 2 ) , non restorative sleep ( 3 ) , generalize morning stiffness ( 4 ) . Other syndrome also frequently see include headache , TMJ , irritable bowel syndrome , depression , anxiety , paresthesias memory loss . FMS may primary secondary disease state . Conditions like hypothyroidism may mimic FMS . The prevalence depression 30-35 % ( 1 ) . FMS affect woman men ( 20:1 ) prevalence increase age 7 % woman 70 year age affect compare prevalence rate 2 % general population . The diagnosis base patient complaint pain clinical examination multiple tender point ( 11/18 ) define ACR criterion FMS ( 8 ) ( 11 less ) per Copenhagen declaration . There specific laboratory test FMS . The cause unknown , many investigator believe FMS encompass spectrum disease common pathogenic pathway . Links FMS non-restorative deep sleep report ( 2 ) . Other change frequently see FMS patient include elevate interleukin-2 ( 3 ) , low level serum serotonin precursor tryptophan ( 4 ) elevate substance -P level ( 5 ) . There increase interest effect serotonin pain recent year . Serum serotonin level show significantly low fibromyalgia patient without fibromyalgia ( 6 ) . Evidence available suggest administration serotonin precursor tryptophan improve pain symptom variety patient cohort . ( 7 ) Treatment generally multidisciplinary emphasis active patient participation , cognitive behavioral therapy , physical modality medication . ( 9 ) . A review literature reveals consensus pharmacological treatment FMS . A rational polypharmacy advocate medication use improve pain , sleep , fatigue associate symptom . ( 10 ) Oral agent utilized symptomatic relief include acetaminophen , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication , steroid . Each associate potentially serious medical sequela chronic use , result disappoint . Cyclobenzaprine ( flexeril ) show efficacy FMS though common side effect , dry mouth drowsiness , limit use . ( 11 ) Benzodiazepines opiate , also utilized FMS potentially addictive . Modafinil ( Provigil ) use treat fatigue associate FMS ( 12 ) . Case report indicate usefulness atypical antipsychotic like olanzapine treatment FMS symptom ( 13 ) . No one medication find control symptom FMS goal therapy improve pain , function quality life combine least amount medication . There 21 control trial involve antidepressant , involve tricyclic antidepressant . A recent meta analysis reveal compare placebo , effect size tricyclic antidepressant substantially large zero measurement ( 14 ) . Two randomize placebo control trial examine SSRI fluoxetine ( 20 mg per day 6 week ) ( 15,16 ) two examine SSRI citalopram ( 20-40 mg per day 8 week ) ( 17 , 18 ) treatment FMS . These study equivocal result ; trial limit high dropout rate placebo group , brief trial duration small sample size . In recent study , Wetherhold et al , examine 82 woman fibromyalgia , randomize receive either paroxetine ( 20 mg/day ) , nabumetone ( 2000 mg/day ) combination paroxetine ( 20 mg/day ) nabumetone ( 2000 mg/day ) . Patient receive treatment regimen period 8 week . The study demonstrate combination regimen superior nabumetone alone , paroxetine alone , improve sign symptom fibromyalgia - suggest paroxetine responsible improvement combine regimen ( 19 ) . Thus , non-addictive oral agent , dual action ( NE 5 HT reuptake blockade ) relatively benign side effect profile paroxetine ( Paxil ) , potential significant addition treatment FMS . Moreover , paroxetine 's side effect profile favorable tricyclic antidepressant therefore would likely preferable treatment option effective . A recent extended release preparation paroxetine ( Paxil CR ) prudentially absorb intestine rather stomach report favorable GI side effect profile may particularly suitable study . The agent could use alone adjunctively decrease patient 's requirement analgesic medication . This study propose study Paxil CR , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , treat FMS particular emphasis effect full constellation symptom associate disorder quality life improvement patient population . In experience physician multiple specialty ( family medicine/neurology/physiatry/rheumatology/pain medicine/psychiatry ) increasingly discuss anecdotal report efficacy SSRIs treat FMS symptom . This study protocol intend evaluate efficacy practice . It hypothesis paroxetine show effective addition treatment define . Study Design : Randomized , double blind , parallel group , flexible dose , placebo control 12-week study . Subject number : One hundred twenty five . Study Schedule : ( see attach schedule evaluation ) Patients screen eligibility base confirm diagnosis FMS ( per report rheumatologist treat specialist ) . Only meet eligibility criterion ( inclusion/exclusion criterion ) permit give informed consent enter study . Psychological assessment perform use standardized questionnaire screen , baseline define time point study described schedule evaluation . After blood draw routine lab exclude potential treatable condition , pregnancy test ( woman ) , urine test illicit drug EKG , participant enter one- week placebo lead-in period ; show le 25 % reduction FIQ enter randomization phase . The routine lab include CBC differential , SMA-7 , liver function test , thyroid panel , Anti Nuclear antibody ( ANA ) , Rheumatoid factor ( Rh factor ) , Anti Polymerase Antibody ( APA ) , C-Reactive protein Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) . Patients instruct swallow tablet whole crush chew via label medication bottle . Eligible study participant randomize either paroxetine placebo ( 60 patient arm ) . Those active treatment group receive dos Paxil CR follow manner : week 1 : 12.5 mg per day , week 2 : 25 mg per day , week 3 : 37.5 mg per day , wk 4 : 50 mg per day week 5 : 62.5 mg per day . Patients tolerate high dos maintain minimum tolerated dose . The placebo arm treat identically except content capsule . The total duration active treatment 12 week . Patients see weekly first 4 week biweekly thereafter . After final visit , study medication taper 2 week . Unblinding procedure case emergency : A list patient randomization number correspond treatment available local Pharmacy . In case emergency local pharmacy call ( 24 hour ) reveal study assignment patient . Once blind broken , patient immediately discontinue study evaluate treat warranted clinical condition .</detailed_description>
