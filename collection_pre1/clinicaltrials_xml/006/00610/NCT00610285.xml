	<brief_summary>Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) way accurately treat brain tumor . SRS involve use special head frame keep head move treatment . The head frame make accurate treatment possible . The frame must attach skull special pin . It feel tight hurt . A special immobilization device use keep head move . This device need pin hurt . We would like see new way hold head still use SRS . This purpose study . New X-Ray machine use find head move mask . We hope use new tool treat brain tumor accurately without use head frame . It make treatment comfortable patient . This ask patient join study .</brief_summary>
