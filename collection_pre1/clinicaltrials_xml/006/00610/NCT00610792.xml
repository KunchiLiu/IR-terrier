	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , multicenter open label , uncontrolled 2-step design . Patients arrange two group base upon response last platinum contain therapy . The two group , 1 ) Platinum Resistant Patients : patient progressive disease platinum contain therapy stable disease least 4 cycle ; patient relapse follow objective response still receive treatment ; patient relapse objective response within 6 month discontinuation last chemotherapy 2 ) Platinum-Sensitive Patients : patient relapse follow objective response 6 month discontinuation platinum contain chemotherapy . All patient receive pyridoxine least 200mg mouth daily begin approximately one week prior initiation combination chemotherapy continue end last treatment cycle .</brief_summary>

Patients may measurable disease strictly follow RECIST guideline . CA125 level must obtain accord Rustin guideline enable complete evaluation response/progressive disease accord GCIG guideline . Patients may enter solitary measurable lesion confirm histology/cytology . These patient consider evaluable response accord modified RECIST require histological/cytological confirmation lesion . CA125 level must obtain accord Rustin guideline enable complete evaluation progressive disease accord GCIG guideline . Patients nonmeasurable disease consider evaluable response provide CA125 data collect accord Rustin guideline complete evaluation response/progressive disease accord GCIG guideline maybe conduct .
