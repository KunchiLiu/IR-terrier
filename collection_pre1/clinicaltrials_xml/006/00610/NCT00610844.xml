	<brief_title>Preoperative Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation Primary Secondary Lung Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thermal ablation therapy increasingly perform technique local tumor treatment . Among technique , image-guided radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation attain widespread consideration therapy liver tumor osteoid osteoma . Promising result hepatic RF ablation raise expectation utilize advantage image-guided ablation therapy treatment pulmonary malignancy . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness radiofrequency ablation pathological correlation characterize tissue response treatment primary secondary pulmonary tumor . Computed tomography-guided RF ablation perform local general anesthesia , follow surgical resection three day later . An analysis complete RF ablation characterization tissue response perform hematoxylin eosin staining , immunostaining , electron microscopy . Adverse effect complication record .</detailed_description>
