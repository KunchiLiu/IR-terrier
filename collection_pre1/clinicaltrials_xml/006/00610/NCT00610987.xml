	<brief_summary>It establish provide antibiotic prophylaxis close fracture fixation implant prosthetic device beneficial effect . However , optimal duration antibiotic prophylaxis orthopaedic trauma surgery well-defined . Most study compare single-dose prophylaxis multiple-dose prophylaxis show beneficial effect additional dos . Our propose study intend define appropriate duration antibiotic ( cefazolin ) administration surgical prophylaxis treatment close fracture . We randomly assign patient two group , hopefully differentiate duration antibiotic administration ( single dose vs. 24 hour ) . We follow patient fracture heal determine difference incidence infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study prospective , randomize , double-blinded clinical trial intend define appropriate duration antibiotic ( cefazolin ) administration surgical prophylaxis internal fixation close fracture . Our hypothesis difference incidence infection single-dose versus 24 hour antibiotic prophylaxis . The null hypothesis multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis decrease incidence infection . Research Design : A prospective , randomize , double-blinded clinical trial conduct evaluate duration antibiotic prophylaxis . After investigator obtain Institutional Review Board approval , recruit patient randomly assign one two group . Both group receive 1 gram ( g ) IV cefazolin prior incision , per standard protocol institution . If tourniquet use , cefazolin administer least 10 minute prior inflation . A 2-g dose cefazolin administer IV patient weigh 80 kg . A second 1-g dose cefazolin give three hour later patient still operate room . Upon completion surgical procedure , Group I receive 1-g dos cefazolin every eight hour next 24 hour . Group II receive additional antibiotic . Instead , receive normal saline injection every eight hour placebo . Group assignment disclose evaluator responsible clinical examination patient end study . Either orthopaedic surgeon nurse practitioner evaluate patient development wound infection . Follow-up occur 10-14 day , six week , 12 week , every six eight week thereafter bony union occurs . Wound infection define one classic sign symptom inflammation ( rubor , calor , tumor , dolor ) together purulent drainage operative site . Wound infection classify either superficial ( infection skin subcutaneous tissue , communicate bone ) deep ( infection reach bone material implant osteosynthesis ) . Bacteriological culture obtain event infectious complication , wound infection diagnose clinically . Several study demonstrate numerous patient-related treatment-related factor predispose infectious complication . We use several factor assign risk score enrol patient . Each factor worth one point total score range 0 ( low risk ) 7 ( high risk ) . The risk factor : 1 ) smoking ; 2 ) age &gt; 65 ; 3 ) diabetes mellitus ; 4 ) obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 ) ; 5 ) duration surgery &gt; 3 hour ; 6 ) urinary catheterization ( 0=no catheter , 1=catheter &lt; 48 hour , 2=catheter &gt; 48 hour ) . Statistical evaluation conduct Student 's t-test patient characteristic chi square analysis infection rate . The relation wound infection various possible risk factor assess forward stepwise logistic regression analysis . Significance define P &lt; 0.05 level .</detailed_description>
