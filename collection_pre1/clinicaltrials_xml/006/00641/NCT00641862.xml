	<detailed_description>The incidence poor fetal growth adverse maternal infant birth outcomes quite high India , several line evidence suggest maternal nutritional status may important factor . We previously perform extensive evaluation poor fetal infant outcome setting , find maternal micronutrient supplementation ( B vitamins include vitamin B12 , plus vitamin C E ) HIV positive Tanzanian mother decrease risk low birthweight ( &lt; 2500 g ) 44 % ( RR ( 95 % CI ) 0.56 ( 0.38-0.82 ) ) , severe preterm birth ( &lt; 34 week gestation ) 39 % ( RR 0.61 ( 0.38-0.96 ) ) , small size gestational age birth 43 % ( RR 0.57 ( 0.39-0.82 ) ) . In prospective cohort study 410 pregnant Indian woman , recently find strong relationship maternal serum vitamin B12 concentration risk infant intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) . Compared woman high tertile serum B12 concentration , woman lowest tertile significantly likely IUGR infant , control maternal age , weight , education , parity ( OR ( 95 % CI ) 5.98 ( 1.72-20.74 ) ) . We propose randomize , double-blind trial among 300 pregnant Indian woman order determine effectiveness vitamin B12 supplementation ( 50 Âµg daily ) improve maternal B12 status . Secondary aim exploratory trial include maternal hemoglobin , maternal weight gain pregnancy infant birthweight . All woman receive standard prenatal obstetric care , include routine supplementation iron folate .
