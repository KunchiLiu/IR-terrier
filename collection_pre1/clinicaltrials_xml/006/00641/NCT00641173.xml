	<detailed_description>Over 150,000 soldier currently deploy Iraq part Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) , 12 % return OIF veteran posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 389,100 soldier develop chronic PTSD Vietnam War , require life-time VA mental health care . These veteran suffer loss work productivity , also show great utilization health care resource high rate physical disease . Research group others show lasting neurobiological consequence PTSD , include increase cortisol response traumatic reminder , verbal declarative memory problems,6 small hippocampal volume reverse treatment serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) paroxetine anticonvulsant phenytoin . Recently find three month treatment paroxetine PTSD patient result increase hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate ( NAA ) , marker neuronal integrity . Subjects treat placebo increase NAA , however subsequent treatment three month open label paroxetine result increase NAA level see subject treated paroxetine double-blind phase . Intervening soon trauma critical long-term outcome , since time traumatic memory become indelible resistant treatment . Diminished efficacy treatment time show fact trial Vietnam veterans show less efficacy year . Animal study show pretreatment stress antidepressant reduce chronic behavioral deficit related stress ; although ethical reason study provide pretreatment trauma exposure human . No study look ability antidepressant treat early PTSD , see great number veteran return OIF . This important , since medication without side effect , assume early PTSD Iraq veteran , example , chronic Vietnam-related PTSD . Obtaining information risk benefit early treatment PTSD OIF veterans critical guiding treatment approach emerge population . In addition , little known potential biomarkers treatment response . We work Georgia National Guard 48th Combat Brigade evaluate health need return OIF veteran , start OIF/OEF Trauma Clinic Atlanta VAMC PI screen return OIF veteran . We propose compare paroxetine placebo return OIF veteran return Iraq past six month , meet criterion early PTSD . Assessment PTSD symptom , hippocampal volume NAA , neuropsychological test memory , cortisol response Iraq-related traumatic script intervention propose provide information effect intervention PTSD symptoms stress-responsive hormonal system .</detailed_description>
