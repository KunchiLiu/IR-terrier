	<brief_title>Effects Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Brain Serotonin Activity People With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression serious illness affect almost 19 million adult United States year . Common symptoms depression include persistent feeling anxiety , guilt , hopelessness ; irregular sleep appetite pattern ; lethargy ; disinterest previously enjoy activity ; excessive irritability restlessness ; suicidal thought ; inability concentrate . A person 's depression attribute variety cause , include biological genetic factor , environmental influence , developmental experience . Among biological factor , recently research possible cause alter activity specialize area brain nerve cell call serotonin receptor , find reduced level people depression . The hormone serotonin know naturally influence mood , make depression treatment aim increase level serotonin important . Treatment depression cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , teach way modify thought behavior contribute depression , may help raise brain serotonin level improve depressive symptom . This study examine change brain serotonin activity use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) image people depression receive CBT . The study also use SPECT image compare brain serotonin activity non-depressed healthy participant depress participant . Participation study last 12 14 week . All participant first undergo initial evaluation include question medical history , physical exam , blood draw , urine test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Participants undergo ADAM ( selective radioligand SPECT imaging ) SPECT scan . During ADAM SPECT scan visit , participant undergo injection ADAM , ECG , blood pressure monitoring , 60-minute SPECT scan . If necessary , participant may also ask magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan complete SPECT scan . Depressed participant attend least weekly CBT session 12 week . During 45-minute session , participant meet therapist learn way adjust thought behavior may add depression . After complete 12 week CBT , participants re-evaluated study doctor , still good health , undergo repeat ADAM SPECT scan .</detailed_description>
