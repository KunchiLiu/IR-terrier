	<brief_summary>The present study first stage research program whose ultimate goal conduct randomize clinical trial involve type 2 diabetic BMI 30.0 39.9 kg/m2 . This program determine relative effectiveness RYGB combine intensive medical management ( IMM ) , versus IMM alone , reduce CVD event rate mortality patient poorly control diabetes . IMM include rigorous lifestyle modification weight loss step pharmacologic treatment diabetes CVD risk factor . The propose study randomize trial provide assessment efficacy treatment , reduce CVD risk factor also assess feasibility , cost , safety large trial .</brief_summary>
