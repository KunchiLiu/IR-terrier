	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy vorinostat ( SAHA ) bortezomib , term progression-free survival ( PFS ) 6 month , patient progressive , recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy regimen , term overall survival , PFS 12 month , time progression , objective response rate , patient . II . To identify molecular predictor response baseline tumor specimens patient . III . To determine molecular change response regimen tumor specimens patient undergo surgery . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan surgery ( [ stratum 1 ] vs yes [ stratum 2 ] ) . STRATUM 1 ( NOT UNDERGOING SURGERY ) : Patients receive oral vorinostat ( SAHA ) daily day 1-14 bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . STRATUM 2 ( UNDERGOING SURGERY ) : Patients receive oral SAHA daily 2 day prior surgery day surgery . Patients also receive bortezomib IV day surgery . After receive 3rd dose SAHA , patient undergo surgery remove tumor . Beginning least 7 day surgery , patient receive SAHA bortezomib stratum 1 . Tumor tissue sample collect baseline surgery ( stratum 2 ) correlative laboratory study . Tissue sample analyze baseline total phosphorylated AKT p27^KIp1 expression IHC . Tissue sample patient stratum 2 also analyze histone acetylation status ; marker proteasome inhibition ; total phosphorylated Bax expression IHC ; gene expression profile . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
