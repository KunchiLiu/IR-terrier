	<brief_summary>Unexplained fever child cancer common occurrence , often require hospital admission evaluation treatment intravenous antibiotic . While empiric use intravenous antibiotic norm population , 48-70 % febrile neutropenic episode remain without identifiable source . An understudied area potential role betaherpesvirus infection febrile episode . These virus significant pathogens patient become immunocompromised conjunction organ transplantation acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . It possible similarly pathogenic child become immunocompromised due cancer chemotherapy . Thus , investigate association betaherpesviruses fever child cancer . The betaherpesviruses include cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , human herpesvirus 6A ( HHV-6A ) , human herpesvirus 6B ( HHV-6B ) , human herpesvirus 7 ( HHV-7 ) . These virus group base share biological genetic property . Each commonly acquire childhood , persist human host , reactivate . Reactivation occur intermittently throughout life healthy individual seldom associate disease . Immune suppression associate high likelihood reactivation clinical disease . Latency viruses involve highly regulate process result virus evade destruction persist within host . Should balance disrupt , cancer anticancer therapy alter normal host state , environment may become favorable betaherpesvirus reactivation , lead disease alteration immune system .</brief_summary>
