	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety TAK-442 Subjects Undergoing Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. develop compound TAK-442 candidate secondary prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome . TAK-442 oral inhibitor activate factor X within blood coagulation cascade . Due critical role propagate coagulation cascade , activate factor X consider therapeutic aim development anticoagulant drug . Therefore activated factor X inhibitor , among agent investigation treatment spectrum thromboembolic disease involve either arterial venous system . Short term anticoagulation often use prevention venous thromboembolism . Patients undergo major orthopedic surgery particularly high risk venous thromboembolism surgery . Consequently , patient routinely give anticoagulant medication surgery . Although parenteral ( injectable ) drug , enoxaparin fondaparinux , use indication , need subcutaneous injection problematic patient discharge hospital . With push short hospital stay , issue increase concern . Therefore , need new oral anticoagulant . Although warfarin use hospital prophylaxis , need coagulation monitoring dose adjustment complicates use . The new oral anticoagulant potential overcome problem give fix dos without need coagulation monitoring . The purpose current study evaluate antithrombotic effect TAK-442 patient undergo elective total knee replacement surgery . This study first TAK-442 trial patient . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate approximately 2.25 month . Multiple procedures occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination , electrocardiograms bilateral venogram . Outside study center , participant randomize enoxaparin require administer study medication subcutaneously syringe .</detailed_description>
