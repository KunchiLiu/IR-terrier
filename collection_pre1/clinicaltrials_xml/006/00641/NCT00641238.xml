	<brief_title>Outcome Patients With Lung Masses Who Are Treated With Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) relatively new treatment localize form cancer . It require device call needle-electrode place tumor . Radiofrequency energy pass needle-electrode heat tissue surround needle tip . If heating effect intense enough maintain long enough period time , cell treat area destroyed . RFA use lung treat metastases cancer originate site , cancer small cell carcinoma ( Non-small cell lung cancer , NSCLC ) arise lung . Pre-treatment assessment include evaluation patient tumor ; determine whether patient meet entry criterion . These criterion : - Patient biopsy-proven NSCLC , sit disease , tumor small enough treat ( usually &lt; 4 cm ) . Clinical stage I NSCLC . - Patient candidate surgical removal cancer , refuse surgery . - Patient candidate radiation therapy , refuse radiation therapy . - Patient &gt; 6 month life expectancy . The procedure perform similar needle biopsy lung , CT guidance . Placement needle-electrode similar needle placement CT-guided biopsy . Appropriate position needle-electrode confirm CT imaging . Radiofrequency energy apply needle-electrode tissue monitor continuously electrical change indicate tissue destruction . After completion treatment , needle-electrode remove . The patient follow least three hour prior discharge . Complications discover time pulmonary hemorrhage ( bleed lung ) pneumothorax ( leakage air lung site needle puncture ) . Subsequent follow-up usually consist CT scan three month six month RFA , six month interval , see whether tumor successfully transform scar , continue grow . This follow-up conducted refer physician , may associate institution . We gather record follow-up information patient die , document recurrence cancer , complete five year post- treatment observation . In case recurrence , also determine whether tumor re-growing treatment site , distant site appear uninvolved time treatment . Statistical analysis perform use de-identified patient data . Measures interest include lifetable determination median survival 5-year overall survival . Patients undergo study-related procedure follow-up period . Chemotherapy give time follow RFA , discretion medical oncologist , result exclusion patient analysis .</detailed_description>
