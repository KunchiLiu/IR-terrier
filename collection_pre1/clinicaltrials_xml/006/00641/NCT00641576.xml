	<brief_summary>Dental implant small metal post look like miniature screw . They surgically implant jawbone serve substitute tooth root . Implants use dentistry reestablish function aesthetic area mouth natural teeth miss . Classical dental implant make two piece . One part anchor jawbone one part serve connect post ( abutment ) attach crown restoration attachment clasp hold denture place . Occasionally material use fasten two implant component together work way loose time abutment may begin disconnect . If happen small gap appear implant abutment . There many reason loosen occurs . One reason may design implant another may way two component fasten together . This study assess performance implant new design . The investigator hypothesize use implant design reduce risk implant-abutment disconnect improve long-term success implant therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While external hex dental implant design good clinical success , limited retention screw loosening junction implant fixture abutment ; situation lead micro-movement component . A number clinical complication may arise implant component separate . Micro-movement implant abutment seat platform think contribute formation `` biological gap '' , notable consequence gradual resorption crestal alveolar bone time . We hypothesize `` ACE CONNECT '' two-piece implant design internal connection limit screw loosen provide stable junction body implant abutment ; stable junction limit micro-movement prevent formation gap component . Limiting gap lead less inflammation peri-implant soft tissue reduce resorption bone adjacent implant .</detailed_description>
