	<detailed_description>Data short-term efficacy comprehensive CR still limit old pt cardiovascular disease , information available maintenance result achieve CR medium- long-term period . As long-term adherence exercise program comprehensive CR generally poor , 30 % reporting regular exercise 12-month follow-up , guideline recommend implementation method aim improve adherence program . The applicability old pt Home-Based exercise program aim enhance adherence prescription maintain physiological benefit attain in-Hospital training period , issue still clarify . The goal study determine pt older 75 year medium- ( 6 month ) long-term ( 12 month ) effect Home-Based exercise program in-Hospital comprehensive CR , compare usual care , exercise capacity , health-related quality life health care service utilization . Pts old 75 year candidate in-Hospital comprehensive CR program acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) cardiac surgery ( coronary artery by-pass graft and/or valvular surgery ) , screen eligibility trial , enrol provide meet exclusion criterion . At baseline , completion CR program , 6- 12-month follow-up , follow data assess enrolled pt : - functional capacity , express total work capacity ( TWC , watt ) maximal aerobic capacity ( peak VO2 , ml/kg/min ) symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test - endurance , express distance cover 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) - low limb muscular strength , measure isokinetic dynamometer - health-related quality life ( SF 36 questionnaire ) - utilization rate health care service At discharge in-Hospital CR program , pts randomly allocate : 1 . Home-Based exercise program , consist prescription specific set exercise detail actively record log book , one reinforcement session Rehabilitation Centre month first 6 month . 2 . Usual care , consist recommendation usefulness physical exercise standard follow-up visit functional assessment 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
