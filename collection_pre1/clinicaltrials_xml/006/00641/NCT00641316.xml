	<brief_summary>When tooth extract ridge bone hold tooth place begin heal time new bone grows fill empty space leave miss tooth . Sometimes process work well new bone grow completely fill socket , time new bone fail fill space completely patient leave uneven bone-fill . Grafted extraction socket may fill bone faster evenly without graft , allow dentist great control heal process repair area dental implant short period time . This study help determine graft extraction socket , without enrich graft material , add benefit compare allow socket heal naturally . The study also assess well two different dental implant design use restore area function time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tooth extraction often associate resorption alveolar ridge height width compromise soft tissue contour . A variety method propose overcome varied pattern post-extraction healing . An increasingly common practice combine skilled surgical technique post-extraction site graft utilizing natural synthetic bone-graft material . These procedure think retard resorption socket volume lend control bone-fill - thereby preserve integrity alveolar ridge future reconstruction dental implant . Limited evidence-based data exist support variety bone-graft material include graft enrich autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) graft enrich recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) . Despite emerge clinical acceptance efficacious intervention remain undetermined . In effort establish clinical evidence , study ass efficacy ridge preservation use three different bone graft application post-extraction socket compare extraction alone . The study also asses longitudinal success restore study site dental implant . Two innovative dental implant design use study ; implant resorbable blast textured ( RBT ) surface implant laser thread-textured ( LTT ) surface .</detailed_description>
