	<detailed_description>With advent antiretroviral therapy , death due opportunistic disease see major decline among patient HIV . However , several antiretroviral medication , particular protease inhibitor ( PI ) , associate increase cardiovascular risk large cohort study . The role inflammation cardiovascular risk currently elucidate . High sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) identify strong independent predictor cardiovascular disease among healthy individual several large cohort study . Other inflammatory biomarkers serum amyloid A ( SAA ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) also correlate cardiovascular risk . Among patient HIV , study reveal inappropriate immune activation increase pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , IL-10 , interferon-γ ( IFN- γ ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) . The effect immune dysregulation impact antiretroviral therapy cytokine biomarkers associate cardiovascular risk remain delineated . Objective : Our aim characterize level inflammatory biomarkers time antiretroviral initiation , define time period biomarkers change stabilize , determine type antiretroviral drug class use impact rate alteration biomarkers . Given disparate cardiovascular risk woman men similar age group , study additional impact gender biomarkers . We also explore whether correlation change CD4 T-lymphocyte count response biomarkers .</detailed_description>
