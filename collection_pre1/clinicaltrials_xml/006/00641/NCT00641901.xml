	<brief_summary>Compelling evidence suggest possible link maternal pregnancy-related periodontitis ( gum disease ) spontaneous pre-term birth ( PTB ) make effective management oral health relevant significant obstetrical-dental issue . The purpose pilot study determine whether intensive education counsel help pregnant woman learn maintain excellent oral health reduce severity gingivitis periodontitis pregnancy . Failure effectively remove plaque biofilm surface teeth every day crucial event lead development gingivitis plaque-induced gingivitis common form periodontal disease pregnant woman . We therefore hypothesize patient teach effectively modulate disease intensive education meticulous home care couple closely monitored behavior modification . We believe may effective approach toward improve oral health potential reduce adverse pregnancy outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Associations Between Gingivitis Pregnancy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adverse pregnancy outcome significant personal public health issue United States approximately 12 % births pre-term ( &lt; 37 week gestation ) . Care neonates account 5 million neonatal intensive care hospital stay year close $ 6 Billion annual health care cost . Premature delivery low birth weight ( LBW ) lead determinates neonatal mortality serious morbidity often leading neurological developmental restriction early childhood . Concomitant data significant social psychological consequence relate maternal family distress effect personal loss . The role maternal periodontitis potential stressor detrimental effect pregnancy outcomes relatively new area investigation . Nevertheless , increase evidence exist support association maternal periodontal disease , chronic anaerobic inflammatory condition oral cavity , adverse pregnancy outcome include pre-term birth ( PTB ) fetal growth restriction . This particularly true early-in-gestation delivery . After adjust age , race , smoke parity , prospective study one-thousand pregnant woman conduct University Alabama Birmingham ( UAB ) demonstrate periodontal disease associate increase risk pre-term birth ( PTB ) odds ratio 4-7 , depend disease severity . These data show 55 % prevalence periodontal disease among cohort ; much high prevalence report national survey . The mechanism responsible association remain unclear . However , substantial data suggest systemic inflammation , measure serum C-reactive protein inflammatory mediator may well underlie observed association . Investigators hypothesize link maternal infection pre-term bith involve microbes host response microbe enter uterine cavity pregnancy . In case remote infection , periodontitis , may occur via blood-bourne route trigger alteration normal cytokine hormone regulatory gestation result premature labor , early rupture membrane preterm birth .</detailed_description>
