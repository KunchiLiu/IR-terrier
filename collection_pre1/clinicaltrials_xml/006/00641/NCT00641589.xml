	<brief_title>A Study Determine Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Profiles PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Anemic Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label ( patient physician know drug drug dose give ) , randomize ( patient assign dose regimen chance ) , multicenter , pharmacokinetic study patient anemia secondary non-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . A pharmacokinetic study one evaluate process drug utilize body . Approximately 40 patient participate study . This study 3 Phases ; Screening Phase , Open-Label Treatment Phase Study Completion/Early Withdrawal Phase . In Screening Phase , patient may evaluate 14 day study entry . The Treatment Phase begin patient randomly assign treatment group continue patient receive last dose study drug . The Study Completion/Early Withdrawal Phase phase last study-related procedure take place . This Phase occur Study Day 64 Q4W group Study Day 36 dose regimen . Patients satisfy study inclusion exclusion criterion consent participate study randomly assign one four treatment group . Dosing continue Study Day 26 treatment group A , Study Day 22 treatment group B , Study Day 15 treatment group C , Study Day 29 treatment group D. No dose escalation dose reduction allow study . Safety monitor physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , occurrence severity adverse event . Safety monitoring continue 30 day last visit treatment group . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic ( study action effect drug body ) sample occur throughout study . A patient evaluable pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter one receive first schedule dose assign study drug , least 75 % pharmacokinetic sample collect include Day 29 group , receive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion prior Study Day 8 . Pharmacokinetic evaluation continue Study Day 29 group A , B , C ; Study Day 57 Group D , include limited : maximal serum concentration erythropoietin , time reach maximal serum concentration time erythropoietin eliminate body . Pharmacodynamic evaluation continue Study Day 36 Groups A , B , C ; Study Day 64 Group D , include limited hemoglobin ( Hg ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) , total red blood cell ( RBC ) count . The primary objective study describe pharmacokinetic profile four different dose regimen PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) patient anemia secondary non-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The secondary objective describe pharmacodynamic response four epoetin alfa study dose regimen . Patients randomly assign one four dosing regimen epoetin alfa : Group A : 50 IU ( International Units ) /kilogram ( kg ) three time per week ( TIW ) ; Group B : 10,000 IU weekly ( QW ) ; Group C : 20,000 IU every 2 week ( Q2W ) ; Group D : 40,000 IU every 4 week ( Q4W ) .</detailed_description>
