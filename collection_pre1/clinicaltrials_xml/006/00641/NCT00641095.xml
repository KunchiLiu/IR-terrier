	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together rituximab effective combination chemotherapy alone treat mantle cell lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare well fludarabine cyclophosphamide work give together without rituximab treat patient previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide With Without Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall survival patient untreated mantle cell lymphoma treat fludarabine phosphate cyclophosphamide v without rituximab . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To determine toxicity regimen patient . - To determine tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV orally daily oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 fludarabine phosphate IV orally daily oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow blood sample collection periodically molecular study . Samples analyze morphology ; sIgM , sIgD , CD19 , CD20 , CD5 , CD10 , CD23 , bcl-1 , bcl-6 via immunophenotyping immunohistochemistry ; ( 11,14 ) translocation via interphase fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) mutational analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK</detailed_description>
