	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth ovarian epithelial cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight ovarian cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well fulvestrant work treat patient recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 90-day clinical benefit ( define sum complete response , partial response , stable disease ) patient recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer treat single agent fulvestrant . Secondary - To establish time termination treatment ( due cause include progression intolerance ) patient treat drug . - To describe toxicity observe patient treated drug . - To evaluate quality life patient treated drug . - To determine effect prolong estrogen receptor antagonism marker bone mineral turnover . OUTLINE : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly day 1 15 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue response end 1 year may continue treatment discretion treat physician . Urinary N-telopeptide serum skeletal-specific alkaline phosphatase assess baseline 1 , 3 , 6 month study determine influence estrogen blockade bone mineral turnover . Quality life assess baseline every 3 month treatment , end treatment use The Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Ovarian ( FACT-O ) cancer questionnaire . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day .</detailed_description>
