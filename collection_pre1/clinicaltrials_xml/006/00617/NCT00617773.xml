	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , Hu3S193 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well Hu3S193 work treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hu3S193 Treating Women With Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 woman platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , base RECIST criterion ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) . Secondary - To determine safety study drug . - To determine drug pharmacokinetics administer multiple weekly injection . Exploratory analysis - Clinical Benefit ( objective response rate + tumor stabilization ) . - Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) . - Duration Response . - Overall Survival . - 12-month survival rate . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 IV 1 hour weekly week 1-8 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly .</detailed_description>
