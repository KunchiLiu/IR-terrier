	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study ThermoDox With Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , double-blinded , dummy-controlled , efficacy , safety study ThermoDox plus RFA versus RFA plus dummy infusion . The 50 mg/m2 ThermoDox dummy infusion administer IV 30 minute . As part blind pre-medication ThermoDox treat subject receive 20 mg dexamethasone orally 48 hour prior drug infusion infusion reaction prophylaxis . Subjects control arm receive match dummy pre-medication pill orally 48 hour prior infusion study treatment . Thirty minute prior receive ThermoDox infusion , subject receive blind dose 20 mg IV dexamethasone , 50 mg IV diphenhydramine either 50 mg IV ranitidine 20 mg IV famotidine . Subjects control arm receive mask dummy pre-medication pill orally 48 hour prior infusion study medication , dummy infusion 30 minute prior dummy infusion D5W ( 250 cc 5 % Dextrose solution ) . RFA initiate approximately minimum 15 minute initiation study drug infusion complete later 3 hour study drug infusion initiation . The total length RFA procedure proportional size tumor ( ) involve anticipated range 12 60 minute lesion estimate overall procedure time le 3 hour . Subjects incomplete ablation re-treated complete ablation accord treatment assign randomization . The completion ablation manner restart timeline study-related visits/procedures . This repeated ablation procedure occur early 21 day post-ablation later 14 day first post-ablation CT scan assessment . These subject start screen ( see Table 1 ) . If complete ablation achieve two study treatment , subject consider treatment failure patient discontinue follow survival . Subjects recur local and/or distant intrahepatic HCC complete initial ablation meet primary endpoint progression-free survival . However , subject lesion amenable RFA standard care consider repeat RFA . Therefore , subject may receive treatment randomize continue meet inclusion exclusion criterion protocol . Subjects develop extrahepatic lesion meet primary endpoint discontinue study treatment still follow overall survival . Dynamic Contrast CT image use assess effectiveness ablation therapy . The blind maintain level CT scan read . All protocol-specified CT image centrally read assessed endpoint committee blind fashion . Posttreatment CT scan obtain month 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 12 every three month thereafter withdrawal . Adverse event assessment laboratory examination occur visit . All subject monitor throughout investigational period . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion may risk contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) undergoing require CT contrast procedure . The investigator must mindful risk factor ( e.g . diabetes , borderline renal function ) associate CIN employ strategy reduce risk CIN . In subject diabetes borderline renal function ( creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL ) special precaution ( e.g . hydration , contrast dose reduction , follow creatinine determination ) employ . An accepted procedure adequate intravenous volume expansion isotonic saline ( 1.0 - 1.5 mL/kg per hour ) 3-12 hour procedure continue 6-24 hour . All randomized subject follow safety overall survival .</detailed_description>

If subject large lesion ( 5.0 7.0 cm ) , lesion must less 5.0 cm . Anticipated ablation volume large either removal 3 hepatic segment removal 30 % total liver volume ( per maximum surgical limit ) . If additional lesion discover laparoscopic open treatment procedure , undetectable CT screening , size location lesion ( ) record CRF lesion treat discretion physician guide local standard care . The subject remain study lesion treat . If lesion completely ablate within two treatment attempt subject consider treatment failure . Study subject consider retreatment disease progression may 4 lesion . Male female 18 year age old . Are willing sign inform consent form , indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy institution . Be appropriate candidate receive RFA medically indicate treatment evaluate follow factor : Number lesion Size lesion Overall health liver Not candidate surgical resection Have echocardiogram revealing Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % . Measurements multiple gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan allow echocardiogram perform . The method measurement use evaluate ejection fraction ( EF ) subject duration study .
