	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine response rate Revlimid® combine Doxil® Dexamethasone ( Dd-R ) newly diagnose Multiple Myeloma . The study also evaluate side effect cause combination three drug . This therapy investigational treatment Multiple Myeloma . Revlimid® drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Revlimid® approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) Multiple Myeloma , two different type blood cancer . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . Doxil® form chemotherapy . It approve FDA treatment relapsed/ refractory Multiple Myeloma combination Velcade . Dexamethasone steroid . It also approve FDA , treatment Multiple Myeloma . It consider standard part myeloma therapies newly diagnose patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin , Low Freq Dexamethasone &amp; Revlimid ( Dd-R ) Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction Phase : Newly diagnose multiple myeloma patient active disease , treat Dd-R outline : All patient also receive Levaquin 500 mg mouth ( PO ) every day ( QD ) [ allergic receive amoxicillin 250 mg PO twice day ( BID ) ] , acyclovir 400 mg PO BID Valacyclovir 500 mg BID aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily receive Dd-R. Aspirin continue maintenance . For patient tolerate aspirin , low molecular weight heparin therapeutic dos coumadin may use place aspirin . - Doxil® 30 mg/m^2 day # 1 repeat every 28 day - Dexamethasone 40 mg per day 4 day ( day 1-4 ) every 28 day - Revlimid® 25 mg PO daily day 1-21 , follow 7 day therapy , repeat every 28 day Maintenance Therapy : Patients complete induction regimen complete least 2 cycle induction regimen show evidence progressive disease tolerate chemotherapy could start maintenance therapy follow : - Revlimid® 15 mg 25 mg* PO daily day 1-21 , follow 7 day therapy , repeat every 28 day Patients start maintenance therapy dexamethasone dose tolerate completion induction phase . *The start Revlimid® dose maintenance either 15 mg 25 mg , determine base whether specific criterion meet schedule Day 1 . - Dexamethasone 40 mg per day 4 day ( day 1-4 ) every 28 day All participant also receive aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily receive maintenance . For patient tolerate aspirin , low molecular weight heparin therapeutic dos coumadin may use place aspirin .</detailed_description>
