	<brief_summary>Study 1304 Phase I dose escalation study conduct adult persistent moderate ( grade 2 ) severe ( grade 3 ) swell due inflammatory arthritis ( rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylose spondylitis ) least one peripheral joint eligible injection . Disease must severe enough warrant use TNF-alpha antagonist next three month . Current use TNF-alpha antagonist permit . Subjects rheumatoid arthritis must adequate trial least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) prior screen . The primary objective evaluate safety intra-articular administration tgAAC94 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study Intra-Articular Administration tgAAC94</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tgAAC94 recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( AAV2 ) vector genetically engineer contain cDNA human tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) -immunoglobulin ( IgG1 ) Fc fusion ( TNFR : Fc ) gene . The DNA sequence TNFR : Fc tgAAC94 code protein sequence identical etanercept ( Enbrel ) . TNF-alpha strongly implicated major participant inflammatory cascade lead joint damage destruction diseases rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . Intra-articular delivery TNFR : Fc gene ( tgAAC94 ) result expression secrete protein joint space provide local high concentration soluble TNFR : Fc extend period time without require frequent administration . Thus , propose therapy would useful inflammatory arthritis patient persistently problematic joint despite use systemic TNF-alpha blockade limit number arthritic joint . Extensive preclinical study use rAAV2 contain several different transgene variety animal model show efficient persistent gene transfer expression minimal toxicity . The parent virus ( wild-type AAV2 ) naturally occur , non-replicating virus depend helper virus , adenovirus , replication . The recombinant AAV2 vector unable replicate target host cell lack AAV gene , whose protein product also require trans , replication packaging progeny virus . Extensive epidemiological study find AAV2 non-pathogenic . Although cure inflammatory arthritis , treatment revolutionized advent anti-TNF-alpha therapy . These include etanercept ( Enbrel ) , infliximab ( Remicade ) adalimumab ( Humira ) , consist soluble TNF receptor , chimeric human-mouse anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody , respectively . Clinical study show product improve sign symptom , inhibit structural damage , impact functional outcome patient inflammatory arthritis .</detailed_description>
