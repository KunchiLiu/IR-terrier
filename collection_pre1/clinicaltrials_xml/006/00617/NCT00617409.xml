	<brief_title>To Immunize Patients With Extensive Stage SCLC Combined With Chemo With Without All Trans Retinoic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After initial diagnosis patient treated standard platinum/etoposide regimen . This standard first-line chemotherapy may/will administer patient direction primary medical oncologist inside outside Moffitt Cancer Center . Patients receive platinum drug day 1 etoposide day 1-3 21-day cycle 4-6 cycle . Patients progressive disease ( PD ) point change second line chemotherapy , eligible participate clinical trial . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) standard first-line chemotherapy enrol . Radiographic study tumor measurement repeat 3-6 week last dose chemotherapy ( +/- PCI ) may repeat prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) discretion principal investigator ( PI ) treat physician . PCI permit discretion treat oncologist ( ) . The initial radiation consultation simulation occur soon final staging occur . Ideally , treatment commence 1-2 week final staging confirm administer 10-15 fraction 2-3 week period , recommend treat radiation oncologist . Although steroid use prohibit , recommend prefer use PCI ( steroid discontinue ≥ 2 week first vaccination ) . PCI also consider vaccine # 4 # 5 vaccine # 5 # 6 patient eligible second course vaccination . Systemic dose steroid NOT allow case unless strictly necessary discussion PI . Patients achieve CR , PR SD completion first line chemotherapy +/- PCI screen initial registration . Screening test procedure perform approximately 4-6 week completion first line chemotherapy 6-9 week completion PCI . Ideally , screen complete 1-2 week prior leukopheresis . Patients successfully complete screen exams initial registration randomize one three study arm .</detailed_description>
