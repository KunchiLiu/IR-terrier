	<brief_summary>Severe skin damage cause chronic venous disorder ( CVDs ) result relentless pain poor quality life million adult U.S. year . DVDs under-recognized under-treated disorder shat harm vein legs bad , cause skin inflammation venous leg ulcer . A new way ease pain inflammation propose study cryotherapy ( cool gel wrap ) apply damage skin lower legs CVD-affected individual . The study hypothesis predict novel cryotherapy model method significantly improve health quality life CVDs intervention become standard care CVDs . In addition , method , time , reduce health care cost associate treat poor CVD outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic venous disorder ( CVDs ) often cause long-term disability experience bad manifestation CVDs : disable pain non-healing leg ulcer . Such disability significant socioeconomic implication term lose work day wage , decrease productivity , ultimately increase health care cost deteriorate well-being quality life CVD-induced illness . Because reliable preventive mechanism exist CVDs , study proposes preventive , self-management cryotherapy intervention target inflame skin population CVDs high risk develop chronic leg ulcer . The propose cryotherapy intervention utilize randomize controlled clinical trial develop method reduce clinical symptom improve exist therapy - treatment CVDs . In proposed pilot feasibility study , subject randomize two group ; cryotherapy intervention group ( n=30 ) receive four-week , cryotherapy gel wrap apply daily affect skin lower legs addition standard care ( usual care ) . The control group ( n=30 ) receive usual care compression wrap stocking apply low legs daily leg elevation . With method , improvement skin microcirculation , reduce leg pain , improvement quality life observe . The following aims test hypothesis : Aim 1 : Evaluate feasibility novel intervention include treatment fidelity , subject training , safety , side effect associate equipment recruitment effort refine intervention protocol , include questionnaire use previous study . Aim 2 : Estimate variability outcome measurement effect size need calculate sample size subsequent large , adequately power , randomize clinical trial efficacy novel cryotherapy intervention . Aim 3 : Investigate presence preliminary `` signal '' clinical efficacy experimental treatment evaluate trend toward statistical significance hypothesis experimental group experience great reduction skin temperature blood flow , great improvement pain , great improvement quality life .</detailed_description>
