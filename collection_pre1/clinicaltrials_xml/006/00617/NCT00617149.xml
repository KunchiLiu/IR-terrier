	<brief_title>Effect Regular Exercise Prevention Excessive Weight Gain Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Data population-based survey longitudinal observational study generally support inactive men woman high body weight BMI physically active adult ( US Departmentof Health Human Services , 1996 , Williamson et al. , 1993 , Sherwood et al. , 2000 , Anderssen et al. , 2007 ) . Studies examine impact exercise maternal weight gain vary limited . Two different meta- analysis 's find difference maternal weight gain exerciser non-exercisers ( Kramer , 2002 , Lokey et al. , 1991 ) . In review 2004 suggest woman exercise pregnancy continue pregnancy tend weigh less gain less weight control ( Siega-Riz et al. , 2004 ) . A recent study Haakstad et al ( Haakstad et al. , 2007 ) find woman continue exercise regularly 3rd trimester significantly low total weight gain . In addition , woman report high exercise frequency 3rd trimester ( ≥ 4 time per week ) , proportion exceed IOM 's weight gain recommendation significantly low compare woman exercise less frequently ( 1-3 time per week ) ( Haakstad et al. , 2007 ) . These result indicate may dose-respons relationship , high level exercise effective moderate low level prevention high maternal weight gain . So far , intervention study aim weight management pregnancy perform ( Gray-Donald et al. , 2000 , Olson et al. , 2004 , Polley et al. , 2002 , Kinnunen et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , intervention focus gestational weight gain may alter individual counsel combine diet exercise habit , rather supervise training . Search PubMed reveal randomize control trial main outcome investigate effect supervise structure exercise may reduce proportion woman gain weight optimal . The aim present study ass whether 12-week aerobic exercise program pregnancy prevent excessive gestational weight gain . Method : Participants This single blind randomize control trial evaluate effect structure , supervise aerobic exercise program weight gain stabilization primiparous pregnant woman . Participants recruit via health practitioner ( physician , midwife ) , article advertisement newspaper , official website pregnant woman , flyer word mouth . The aim include 100 woman . With power = 0.85 alfa = 5 % , present study design detect standardize difference total weight gain 0.6 . Assuming standard deviation weight gain 5 kilo , actual weight gain ∆= 3 kilo . Inclusion/exclusion At first contact phone , aim implication study explain eligibility criterion check . Primiparous woman participate structured exercise program , include significant amount walk past six month eligible trial . Other inclusion criterion ability read , write speak Norwegian , within first 24 week pregnancy . Exclusion criterion severe heart disease , pregnancy induce hypertension , history two miscarriage , persistent bleed week 12 gestation , poorly control thyroid disease , poorly control pre-eclampsia disease could interfere participation ( Artal O'Toole , 2003 ) . In addition , woman live far university able attend weekly training group ineligible . Procedure outcome measure Interested woman eligible present study invite pre-test include interview assessment university . All visit accomplish daytime normal working hour . The woman examine three time study period . The first visit 12 24 week gestation , second week 36-38 last 8-12 week delivery . Each visit last 60-75 minute . There induction exercise program gestation week 12 . At first appointment , principal investigator ( LH ) complete initial interview health screen participant . The requirement study explain possible contraindication exercise identify . Data Pregnancy Health Card register . The baseline questionnaire cover demographic information ( e.g . age , pregnancy week , smoke habit , education , occupation ) , assessment daily life physical activity sedentary behaviour ( work , transportation household ) . In addition , registration pregnancy complication ( e.g . pelvic girdle low back pain , urinary incontinence , high blood pressure , pre-eclampsia , vomit , fatigue ) . The second questionnaire self administrate include question perceive quality life health status last four week . Finally , woman 's pre-pregnancy weight register hight weight measure use digital beam scale . Anthropometric estimation maternal body composition assess Holtain caliper , measure left side skinfold thickness triceps , abdomen thigh . Each measurement do twice hold 5-10 second . A mean value two compute . If two skinfold assessment differ 2mm , skinfold measure third time mean three value calculate . The assessment describe obtained second visit ( week 36-38 gestation ) . At third last visit ( 8-12 week postpartum ) , woman also report infant birth weight complication delivery . The woman ask bring health journal hospital Infant Health Card All subject complete two sub maximal step treadmill test . One test immediately randomization second test week 36-38 gestation . The main sub maximal functional outcome oxygen uptake lactate measurement . After adjustment treadmill , nose clip mouthpiece , participant start walk initial speed 4.5 km/h . The inclination elevate fourth minute exactly 4 % . Blood pressure , heart rate rating perceive exertion ( 6-20 scale ) ( Borg , 1970 ) measure last two minute every step steady state reach base stable oxygen uptake measurement . Capillary blood sample measure blood lactate assess 30 second pause step . The test determine 12-20 minute subject blood lactate concentration rise 1.5 mMol∙L-1 rest level perceive physical exertion 15-17 ( Borg scale ) and/or heart rate &lt; 85 % expect maximal heart rate . The exercise physiologist perform test . All participant give write consent participate , procedure follow accordance ethical standard responsible regional committee human experimentation adhere World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki . The project receive approve The Committee Medical Research Ethics , Southern Norway , Oslo , Norway , 20 February 2006 ( reference number S-05208 ) . Additionally , Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services ( NNT ) provide licence store register individual health information ( reference number 17804/2/KH ) . All data store locked fireproof cabinet accordance requisition NNT . The inclusion woman trial start Sept 2007 continue till 100 participant randomly allocate exercise control group . All follow-up procedure expect finish within Mars 2009 . There financial compensation participant . Randomization procedure The randomization procedure take place determination eligibility , complete baseline examination measurement primary outcome variable . Based statistical randomization computer program , independent person assign participant two group . The participant inform reveal information group assign principal investigator ( LH ) . The principal investigator involve train woman blind group allocation make outcome measure plot data . It consider ethically incorrect use control group receive treatment present study . Exercise program The exercise program consist supervise exercise 60 minute , perform least 2 time per week , 12-16 week . Since participant work full time , exercise group arrange even . Each session start ca 5 minute warm , follow 30 minute aerobic activity , include cool . This follow 15 minute strength train upper low limb , special focus deep abdominal stabilization muscle ( transversus abdominus muscle , pelvic floor back muscle ) . The last 5 minute contains stretch , relaxation body awareness exercise . Aerobic exercise include low impact exercise ( jump run ) . Step length body rotation reduce minimum , crossing legs sharp sudden change position avoid . The exercise-program follow ACOG exercise prescription , aerobic activity perform moderate intensity ( 60-70 % maximal heart rate ) , measure rating perceive exertion 11-14 ( somewhat hard ) 6-20 Borg 's rating scale . The exercise program choreograph lead certified aerobic instructor , session include maximum 25 participant . In addition joining schedule aerobic class , woman motivate include 30 minute moderate self-imposed physical activity rest week-days . They also advise incorporate short bout activity daily schedule . For example , participant encourage walk instead drive short distance use stair instead elevator . The participant ask keep daily record minute physical activity . Compliance training protocol control instructor registration womens personal training diary . Control-participants neither encourage discouraged exercising . Statistical analysis Analysis complete assess effect intervention two primary five secondary outcome : Primary outcome overall weight gain pregnancy proportion participant exceed weight gain IOM recommendation . Secondary outcome pregnancy complication , relationship oxygen consumption , heart rate blood lactate concentration submaximal work load , infant birth weight , length labour complication delivery . The principal analysis do intention treat basis . Missing value carry forward baseline value . The primary dependant variable total weight gain proportion woman exceed IOM recommendation . Average total weight gain compare two group possible difference test use two-sided independent sample t-test . The group differences proportion participant gain weight IOM guideline test use two-sided X2-test . The secondary outcome ; self-report complication pregnancy delivery , well number high birth weight infant ( ≥4200 g ) ( Skjaerven et al. , 2000 , Orskou et al. , 2003 ) compare intervention control group test use X2-test Fisher 's exact test . The two-sided independent sample t-test use test difference submaximal cardiorespiratory capacity , gestation week delivery , infant 's birth weight duration labour . In statistical analysis , level statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Professor biostatistics , Ingar Holme , Norwegian Scholl Sport Science , advise present study .</detailed_description>
