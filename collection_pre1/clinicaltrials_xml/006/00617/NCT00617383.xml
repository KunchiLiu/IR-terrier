	<brief_summary>The definition 'at-risk ' population within highly susceptible group would provide opportunity preemptive therapeutic . A convenient , safe , tolerable therapy delay onset clinical disease pre-symptomatic stage demyelinate disease would provide therapeutic alternative 'wait see ' approach subject 'high risk ' CIS ( clinically isolate syndrome - monosymptomatic demyelinating disease ) MS . Identical twin share gene high rate share MS. An identical female sister twin MS 34 % chance MS . Non concordant ( MS yet ) identical ( monozygotic - sperm-egg zygote ) female twin provide ideal population find factor predict onset MS non-affected twin . We recruit 30 identical female twin , one MS without MS , obtain brain MRI biological sample non-affected twin determine : - presence characteristic MS-like lesion ( ) baseline MRI predispose MS. - specific protein blood cerebrospinal fluid predispose clinical expression demyelinate disease If predict simple test ( MR brain scan blood test ) likelihood onset MS 'at risk ' subject , safe tolerable therapy , may able prevent clinical onset demyelinate disease ( MS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Determine presence characteristic MS-like lesion ( ) baseline MRI predispose CIS/MS female MZ twin discordant CIS/MS . Secondary Objective : Define protein microarray gene expression profile predictive conversion MS/CIS female MZ twin discordant CIS/MS . Design Outcomes : This single center , clinical study determine presence MS-like MRI brain lesion predict rate conversion CIS female MZ twin discordant CIS/MS . We screen recruit 30 subject , begin follow subject annually total 5 year determine MR brain scan predict CIS/MS conversion . Interventions Duration : Subjects recruit 2 year follow five year annual neurological examination MR brain scan . Sample Size Population : 30 female co-twins discordant CIS/MS study . We predict 72 % 27 % 'at risk ' subject characteristic MR brain lesion baseline convert CIS within 5 year . We predict 6 % 73 % 'at risk ' subject without characteristic MR brain lesion baseline convert CIS within 5 year . These data determine paraclinical ( MRI ) evidence demyelinate disease specific blood cerebrospinal fluid protein predict clinical expression disease highly susceptible population predicts .</detailed_description>
