These participant first receive robatumumab , surgery perform , continue receive treatment every two week year dosing , disease progression . Participants unresectable osteosarcoma Ewing Sarcoma receive robatumumab IV every two week disease progression . Participants achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) tumor evaluation may undergo surgical resection . After surgery , participant eligible receive 10 mg/kg robatumumab disease recurrence/progression one year total dosing , whichever occur first .</brief_summary>
