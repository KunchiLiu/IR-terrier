	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Subjects With Neuropathic Pain From PHN Who Have Had Inadequate Response Gabapentin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study PXN110527 investigate efficacy high ( 3600mg/day ) dose versus low ( 1200mg/day ) dose GEn subject post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) history inadequate response gabapentin treatment . The study cross-over design . Prior screen subject require demonstrated history inadequate response ( determined investigator ) least 1800 mg/day gabapentin . Prior history treatment gabapentin include current treatment 1800mg/day ( 2 week ) prior treatment ≥1800mg/day ( 4 week ) . Subjects could also treat pregabalin monotherapy ( 150-300mg/day , ≥4 week ) inadequate response . Subjects treat gabapentin 1800mg/day Baseline Period randomize Basleline Period compliant gabapentin treatment 24-hour average pain intensity score ≥4.0 base 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale ( PI-NRS ) . Subjects randomize receive gabapentin enacarbil ( either 1200mg/day 3600mg/day 1:1 ratio ) Treatment Period 1 ( 28 day ) . Followed dose 2400mg/day 4 day alternate fix dose ( either 3600 mg/day 1200 mg/day ) Treatment Period 2 ( 28 day ) .</detailed_description>
