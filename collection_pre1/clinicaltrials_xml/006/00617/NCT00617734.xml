	<brief_title>Study IMC-A12 , Alone Combination With Cetuximab , Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( MSCC ) Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The routine cancer treatment Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck Cancer improve still leave percentage patient incurable disease . New alternative patient whose disease refractory exist therapy need . IMC-A12 monoclonal antibody bind special receptor know IGF-1R . This bind action show inhibit growth variety human tumor cell line . The purpose study evaluation effect IMC-A12 Cetuximab ( Erbitux® ) patient Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck Cancer spread part body , determine long drug remain body . The study also look side effect IMC-A12 may cause patient receive treatment .</detailed_description>
