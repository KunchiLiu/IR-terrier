	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis ( AR ) condition exist individual specific allergy reacts allergen result runny and/or stuffy nose , postnasal drip , possible symptom sneeze , scratchy throat , itchy nose , ear throat . When allergic person expose allergen , body reacts overproduction certain chemical cause inflammation subsequent symptom AR . These response relate body 's hyperreactive response exposure otherwise harmless substance dust , ragweed , pollen , cat dander etc . There data suggest air pollution result diesel exhaust increase body 's response airway inflammation cause virus . The purpose research study determine individual AR increase inflammatory response flu virus follow exposure diesel exhaust ( DE ) v exposure clean air compare individual allergy respond exposure condition . The hypothesis study diesel exhaust exacerbate LAIV-induced allergic nasal inflammation , use control exposure AR volunteer compare non-allergic individual</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening day : This visit occur approximately 2-4 week exposure day . You come research facility discus consent form study coordinator complete signature area . Your vital sign ( pulse , temperature , BP , oxygenation saturation ) measure follow evaluation perform : - For female child bear potential , urine pregnancy test - Review medical history recent health change - Completion questionnaire regard allergy symptom - Collection spirometric ( pulmonary function test ) data perform . You must demonstrate normal pulmonary function order continue study . You ask inhale deeply possible , exhale rapidly completely possible mouthpiece connect computer measure various lung volume tell u lung function normal . - Blood draw hand arm vein test HIV recent influenza exposure , well serum marker , T cell stimulation WBC characterization . The volume blood 50 cc ( approximately 3 tablespoon ) . - A buccal swab perform genotyping entail rub toothbrush inside cheek loosen cell follow repeat rub place soft swab ( similar Q tip® longer stick ) . - Physical examination study physician - Allergy skin test perform previous 2 year - Collection nasal lavage fluid involve spray salt water nose repeatedly blow nose cup - Nasal biopsy researcher gently scrap inside line nose plastic stick Day 0 ( Monday ) : You ask eat light breakfast arrive EPA early mid morning . You need wear comfortable clothes shoe , bring lunch . - Collection vital sign measurement update medical condition well medication take since previous visit - Urine pregnancy test , applicable - A telemetry monitor place heart rhythm monitor chamber exposure . This include monitor wire attach chest shoulder adhesive pad . The end wire connect box tie waste transmit heart rhythm screen observe - Spirometry measurement : This test measure volume air exhale rate airflow exhalation maximal inhalation . You inhale deeply possible , exhale rapidly completely possible spirometer . Measurements obtain maneuver include forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume first second ( FEV1 ) , maximal mid-expiratory flow rate ( FEF 25-75 % ) peak flow ( PF ) . The large FVC FEV1 , least 3 acceptable trial , select analysis ; flow rate select trial large sum FVC . - Nasal lavage - You 2 hour exposure either diesel particle air . The type exposure receive randomize , mean assign air diesel exposure group chance , like flip coin . The exposure double blind mean neither study investigator staff know whether exposed diesel exhaust air except event emergency information could reveal . If randomize receive diesel exposure , diesel generate engine mount vehicle locate outside EPA Human study Facility ( HSF ) . The diesel exhaust ( DE ) introduce exposure chamber dilution clean filter humidified air approximately 1/30th give chamber concentration approximately 100 μg/m3 . The amount DE use exposure study would equivalent concentration encounter busy intersection large urban area . DE concentration propose occupational level truck driver ( generally 100-300 µg/m3 ) 1-2 mg/m3 mine . Some area heavily traffic street Los Angeles New York City DE level &gt; 20 µg/m3 , nearby resident could exposure concentration several hour . If randomize clean air , receive Chapel Hill air filter remove ambient air pollutant - After exposure additional spirometry test return medical station monitor 3 hour . You also time eat lunch request bring home - Both exposure , level carbon monoxide blood test - Three hour exposure complete , FluMist® vaccine administer spray vaccine nostril . Shortly discharge home Days 1-3 ( Tuesday-Thursday ) . Each day , follow obtain : - Vital sign update change medical condition - Nasal lavage Day 4 ( Friday ) : - Vital sign medical update - Nasal lavage - Nasal biopsy - Blood draw - serum marker , WBC characterization . The volume blood 50cc ( approximately 3 tablespoon ) Day 9 +/- 1 day ( one visit sometime Tuesday Thursday week receive FluMist® ) : - Vital sign health update - Nasal lavage Day 21 +/-7 day FluMist dose - Vital sign health update - Urine pregnancy test , applicable - Blood draw check post -vaccine anti-influenza titer , well serum marker , T cell stimulation WBC characterization . The volume blood 50 cc ( approximately 3 tablespoon )</detailed_description>
