	<brief_summary>The purpose study give drug regimen hop effective preventing cancer come back . Since aggressive breast cancer , moderate high chance cancer may come back . The standard treatment tumor type include chemotherapy regimen drug name epirubicin ( E ) cyclophosphamide ( C ) vein every 2 week 4 treatment , follow drug name paclitaxel , every 2 week vein 4 treatment . This study experimental study give 6 cycle EC follow 6 cycle paclitaxel . The purpose get 2 cycle EC 2 cycle paclitaxel normally give study regimen may effective current standard treatment prevent recurrence cancer . Specifically , study look side-effects risk drug cycle give .</brief_summary>
