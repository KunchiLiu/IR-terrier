	<brief_title>CPT Testing Sacral Neuromodulation Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schedule 1-2 week prior plan implantation SNM wire electrode ( Stage 1 ) . Patients 50 % improvement symptom Stage 1 go Stage II procedures undergo CPT testing . After enrollment , subject complete short medical history questionnaire confirm meet inclusion criterion fall exclusion criterion . This include review recent urinalysis and/or urine culture confirm absence recent urinary tract infection . Participants give information relevant CPT test include need bladder/urethra catheterization part test pre post SNM therapy . At baseline test visit , subject undergo CPT test use transcutaneous stimulation distribution pudendal nerve perineum . Subjects undergo bladder/urethral catheterization use standard sterile technique . Once bladder/urethral catheter place CPT test conduct various frequency identify current perception threshold nerve fiber . At conclusion test catheter remove subject give single dose oral antibiotic minimize infection . This meeting test require approximately 60 minute . Patients undergo Stage I SNM procedure physician subsequent appointment . If subject 50 % improvement symptom 2 week Stage 1 SNM , go Stage II SNM procedure . The subject appointment schedule follow-up CPT test clinical research office 4 6 week Stage II procedure . The subject give urinalysis urine culture lab slip , instruct drop urine sample lab 3 day schedule appointment testing . If urine culture positive , give prescription antibiotic exclude test . They may however test urine culture negative , long within 2 week original post-stage 2 CPT test appointment Subjects undergo repeat CPT test use transcutaneous stimulation distribution pudendal nerve perineum . Subjects undergo bladder/urethral catheterization use standard sterile technique . Once bladder/urethral catheter place CPT test conduct various frequency identify current perception threshold nerve fiber . At conclusion test catheter remove patient give single dose oral antibiotic minimize infection . This evaluation require approximately 60 minute .</detailed_description>
