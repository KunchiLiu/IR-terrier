	<brief_summary>Many arrhythmias detect ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) -zone picture monomorphic ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , hence , could terminate antitachycardia pace ( ATP ) treatment . Advantages successful ATP painlessness termination shorten duration arrhythmia . The ATP One Shot algorithm integrate late family implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) BIOTRONIK ( Lumax ) . It allow single delivery ATP charge capacitor terminate lethal arrhythmia painful shock . The present study evaluate efficacy ATP One Shot algorithm termination fast VT episode . 200 patient secondary prophylactic ICD indication follow 18 month . Spontaneous episode detect VF-zone ICD evaluate regard cycle length , episode duration course device therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast VT Episodes Are Terminated ATP One Shot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICDs provide different detection zone therapy VT VF . An established form therapy VT-zone antitachycardia pacing ( ATP ) . It effective , safe painless method terminate episode slow VT cycle length &gt; 300 ms. Episodes detect VF zone result delivery high-energy shock terminate life-threatening VF . Many arrhythmia detect VF-zone picture monomorphic VT could easily terminate ATP . Advantages successful termination ATP therapy would painlessness shortened duration episode , would need load shock capacitor . Fast VT often hemodynamically poorly tolerate patient terminate within short time . The ATP One Shot algorithm integrate late family ICDs BIOTRONIK ( Lumax ) allow single delivery ATP charge capacitor . The main objective study assessment efficacy ATP One Shot algorithm termination fast VT episode . To end , spontaneous episode detect VF-zone ICD evaluate regard cycle length , episode duration course device therapy . In context study , confirmatory ( hypothesis-testing ) primary problem investigate . The goal measure time first adequate shock therapy episode detect VF-zone device analyze hazard ratio standard ICD setting compare therapy ATP One Shot algorithm . The clinical project conduct randomized prospective multicenter study . The chronological order scope follow-ups meet medical standard accord international guideline . A center-based , stratified block randomization perform . In approximately 50 % patient ATP One Shot algorithm activate , 50 % randomize control group . A total 20 European investigational site participate study . Each center enroll 10 patient follow 18 month .</detailed_description>
