	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether prior exposure A/H2N2 viruses associate well antibody ( part immune system fight infection ) responses vaccination A/H9N2 flu vaccine . The study evaluate much antibody make influenza virus H9N2 flu vaccination body react different strength H9N2 flu vaccine . This information may guide vaccine development virus well bird flu virus infect human . Study participant include 120 healthy subject , age 18-38 44-59 year . Two different dosage vaccine give muscle upper arm 1 month apart . The assignment vaccine participant govern chance . Study procedure may include medical history , physical exam , blood sample . Study participation duration 7 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza A viruses potential cause worldwide epidemic and/or pandemic result significant morbidity mortality . The goal study determine whether person 44 year age ( born 1964 ) evidence prim influenza A/H9N2 virus measure response two different dosage level A/H9N2 vaccine . Evidence prim person born 1964 implication pandemic preparedness planning individual may need single vaccination induce immunity compare person immunologically prim . This study also explore immunogenicity two-dose regimen use homologous A/H9N2 virus antigen hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) neutralize antibody assay . Approximately 120 healthy adult enrol single-center , randomize , double-blind trial subvirion inactivate influenza A/H9N2 ( G9 variant ) vaccine give intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Subjects stratify age , 50 percent dosage group age 18 38 inclusive 50 percent age 44 59 year , inclusive . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive 2 dos one month apart one two dosage ( 7.5 microgram 30 microgram ) A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 subvirion vaccine . The subject staff responsible assessing response vaccination blind dosage level administer . All subject receive two dos assign dosage level give IM route separate approximately 28 day . Subjects observe clinic approximately 20 minute vaccination . Subjects maintain memory aid record oral temperature , systemic local adverse event 7 day inoculation . They return clinic day 8 vaccination ( window 8-10 ) adverse event ( AE ) assessment , concomitant medication assessment , target physical exam ( indicate ) , review memory aid . AE data capture Day 0 Day 56 . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) data capture Day 0 end trial ( 7 month first dose vaccine ) . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination , Day 0 , prior second vaccination , Day 28 Day 56 . The primary objective determine whether person 44-59 year age show evidence immunologic prim A/H9 virus compare person 18-38 year age . The secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity 4 week vaccination evaluate safety tolerability vaccine .</detailed_description>
