	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose monoclonal antibody therapy give together gemcitabine hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride see well work compare give gemcitabine hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride alone first-line therapy treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride gemcitabine hydrochloride together monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0727 Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Erlotinib Hydrochloride With Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess appropriate dose IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) use combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess progression-free survival patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat IMC-A12 plus gemcitabine erlotinib compare treated gemcitabine plus erlotinib alone . ( Phase II ) III . To assess overall survival two treatment arm group patient . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess total response probability ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) two treatment arm subset group patient measurable disease . ( Phase II ) V. To assess qualitative quantitative toxicity two treatment arm group patient . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study cixutumumab follow randomize , phase II study . Patients initially enrol phase I portion study determine recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) cixutumumab . Once RPTD determine , patient enrol phase II portion study . PHASE I ( LIMITED INSTITUTIONS ) : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 , gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , cixutumumab IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II ( ALL SWOG MEMBERS ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride , gemcitabine hydrochloride , cixutumumab RPTD phase I . ARM II : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride gemcitabine hydrochloride arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Previously collect tumor tissue obtain gene expression analyse RT-PCR , RNA isolation , cDNA synthesis . Blood sample collect periodically correlative study . Samples assess potential relationship gene expression level , germline polymorphism , Ras P13K mutation progression-free survival overall survival . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
