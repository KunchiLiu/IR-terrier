	<brief_title>Maternal Immunization To Prevent Infant Otitis Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 24.5 million physician visit otitis medium ( OM ) 1990 estimate treatment indirect cost $ 5 billion . Because major public health impact trouble increase antibiotic resistant organism , vaccine strategy prevent OM test . We previously propose efficacy study determine immunization pneumococcal vaccine pregnancy protect offspring early infant OM , important predictor recurrent chronic OM . Recent data efficacy trial California demonstrate infant immunized 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PNCRM7 ) 2 , 4 , 6 12 - 15 month protect invasive pneumococcal disease 7 month age . Since licensure vaccine , question raise whether maternal immunization pneumococcal vaccine pregnancy suppress active antibody production offspring immunize 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PNCRM7 ) . The main objective study investigate question . We also evaluate vaccine safety , immunogenicity , fetal antibody transfer among woman receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PNCRM9 ) 30 - 35 week pregnancy , determine persistence maternal infant antibody 13 month birth , evaluate opsonic activity maternal infant antibody , determine relationship breast milk serum antibody lactate woman .</detailed_description>

Maternal exclusion criterion : Known hypersensitivity vaccine component latex . Prior vaccination S. pneumoniae vaccine . Recent ( w/in 2 mo ) vaccination diphtheria tetanusdiphtheria toxoid vaccine . Administration influenza , vaccine , RhoGAM 2 wks prior administration study product . Known history lifethreatening pneumococcal infection . Known impairment immunologic function history immunodeficiency . Previous child major congenital anomaly fetal malformation . Known carry one fetus . Any medical condition history , opinion investigator , may interfere evaluation study objective . History preterm birth fetal death . Known history chronic hypertension , severe preeclampsia previous pregnancy , current preeclampsia type diabetes mellitus . Known anatomical defect cervix uterus . Known history teratogenic drug use illegal substance abuse current pregnancy , include tobacco alcohol use . Women test positive ( base medical record information ) HIV hepatitis B infection . Any contraindication specify vaccine manufacturer 's CIB . History febrile illness ( temp 100.0 degree F ) 72 hrs prior vaccine administration . History significant mental illness ( e.g . schizophrenia , psychosis , major depression ) . Infant exclusion criterion : Hypersensitivity component vaccine , include diphtheria toxoid . Thrombocytopenia coagulation disorder would contraindicate intramuscular injection . Latex sensitivity . Known impaired immune responsiveness , whether due use immunosuppressive therapy ( include irradiation , corticosteroid , antimetabolite , alkylating agent , cytotoxic agent ) , genetic defect , HIV infection , cause may reduce antibody response active immunization . Vaccination may delay current recent febrile illness depend largely severity symptom etiology . Although severe even moderate febrile illness sufficient reason postpone vaccination , minor illness , mild upper respiratory infection without lowgrade fever , generally contraindication .</criteria>
