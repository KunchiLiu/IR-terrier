	<brief_summary>This study design test prototype imaging instrument rely Medical HyperSpectral Imaging ( MHSI ) technology assessment prediction diabetic foot ulceration wound heal . The imaging system utilizes biomarkers oxyhemoglobin ( oxyHb ) deoxyhemoglobin ( deoxyHb ) , upper layer skin foot : metric assess wound healing , reflection microvascular disease , determine tissue risk form new ulcer . MHSI result also compare ABI TcPO2 measurement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperspectral Imaging Assess Predict Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ULCER HEALING STUDY : This study compare measurement cohort 66 diabetic subject ( 30 Type 1 36 Type 2 ) least one foot ulcer . The study take place three medical center . Each center enroll 22 subject ( 10 Type 1 12 Type 2 ) . Subjects require participate eleven ( 11 ) clinic visit 6 month period . The first visit last approximately three hour visit last two hour . The eleven visit schedule follow Table right . At initial visit subject give inform consent full medical history , schedule date remain visit study . The subject recruiter contact subject one week prior subsequent visit either confirm subject 's attendance re-schedule visit . NEW ULCER PREDICTION STUDY : This study compare measurement 210 `` high risk '' diabetic subject ( 90 Type 1 120 Type 2 ) 18-24 month period . The study take place three medical center . Each center enroll 70 subject ( 30 Type 1 40 Type 2 ) . Subjects require participate nine ( 9 ) clinic visit . The nine visit schedule follow Table right . The first visit last approximately three hour visit last 2 hour . At initial visit subject give inform consent full medical history , schedule date visit rest study . The subject recruiter contact subject one week prior subsequent visit either confirm subject 's attendance re-schedule visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ulcer Healing Study Subjects Type 1 diabetes ( define diabetes begin age 35 , require insulin , diagnose diabetes six month ) Type 2 diabetes . Presence least one foot ulcer Exclusion criterion : Peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAD ) severe enough require surgical bypass operation . Cardiovascular disease demonstrate instance : congestive heart failure lead severe edema lower extremity , stroke transient ischemic attack residual nerve dysfunction . Uncontrolled hypertension : SBP &gt; 190 mmHg DBP &gt; 110 mmHg End stage renal disease ( subject renal dialysis kidney transplantation ) Any serious chronic disease affect wound heal Subjects currently follow medication : Glucocorticoids , Antineoplastics Females lactate pregnant , childbearing potential , unwilling use standard birth control . All female childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test visit . NEW ULCER PREDICTION STUDY : Inclusion criterion : Subjects Type 1 diabetes ( define diabetes begin age 35 , require insulin , diagnose diabetes six month ) Type 2 diabetes . Subject without foot ulcer `` high risk '' foot ulceration . In order define `` high risk '' study , use International Working Group standard : 1 . Advanced neuropathy , defined loss protective sensation foot vibrational perception threshold ( VPT ) 25mHz inability detect Semmes Weinstein 5.07 ( 10g ) monofilament 2 . Presence significant deformity 3 . Peripheral vascular disease ankle brachial index &lt; 0.7 4 . History previous ulceration presence foot ulcer 5 . At least one foot ulcer free time enrollment Exclusion criterion : Peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAD ) severe enough require surgical bypass operation . Cardiovascular disease demonstrate instance : congestive heart failure lead severe edema lower extremity , stroke transient ischemic attack residual nerve dysfunction . Uncontrolled hypertension : SBP &gt; 190 mmHg DBP &gt; 110 mmHg End stage renal disease ( subject renal dialysis kidney transplantation ) Any serious chronic disease affect wound heal Subjects follow medication : Glucocorticoids Antineoplastic agent Females lactate pregnant , childbearing potential , unwilling use standard birth control . All female childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test visit .</criteria>
