	<brief_summary>Celiac disease autoimmune disease induce wheat gluten . Destruction epithelial cell microvilli gut mucosa cause `` flat mucosa '' absorption defect . The diagnosis base typical microscopical finding biopsy specimens serum antibody tissue transglutaminase certain gliadin peptide strongly associate pathology . Severe diarrhoea associate growth disturbance infancy historically characterise disease nowadays rare . Clinically mild form include silent disease common . Studies base antibody screen biopsy do autoantibody positive subject confirm frequency 1-2 % adult population . Undiagnosed disease associate deficiency nutrient vitamin lead various chronic symptom like anaemia , osteoporosis general fatigue . It also recently find undiagnosed celiac disease may associate general underachievement society probably associate common psychological symptom like fatigue depression adolescence . The disease treat complete elimination wheat , rye barley diet , laborious cause considerable extra cost nutrition . Much progress recently make understanding genetic background immune marker associate disease well understanding pattern gluten introduction infancy , might connect high disease risk . Our aim study first phase identify child high genetic risk ( around 10 % ) follow-up study define : 1 . Are age , dose gluten presence simultaneous breast feed introduction gluten associate risk celiac disease ? 2 . Is possible decrease frequency celiac disease nutritional counselling ? 3 . Is possible predict development celiac disease immunological test development mucosal lesion If confirm , optimise condition introduction wheat gluten infancy diet significantly reduces disease incidence , important effect nutritional recommendation concern diet infancy . Combining genetic screen immunological test might also offer way reduce frequency celiac disease help early diagnosis organisation adequate treatment</brief_summary>
