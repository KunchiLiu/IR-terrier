	<detailed_description>CAH genetic steroidogenesis disorder . The common form , 21OHD , lead cortisol deficiency , turn , excess androgen , hormone promotes development maintenance male sex characteristic . As result androgen excess , prepubescent male newborn , prepubescent , grown female exhibit mature masculine characteristic . Prenatal treatment dexamethasone , corticosteroid decrease androgen level , show prevent development abnormal genitalia female infant . The long-term effect treatment , however , evaluate . This study determine whether prenatal dexamethasone treatment cause long-term side effect examine child young adult receive dexamethasone fetus mother , expose dexamethasone pregnant . This study three part . In Part 1 study , participant provide write consent release medical record physician . Participants ' physician complete medical form and/or provide copy select medical record participant . Parts 2 3 complete 1 day . In Part 2 study , participant complete questionnaire home . Participants answer question follow experience : medical procedure , hormone treatment genital surgery ; education ; work ; hobby ; play activity chores childhood ; identification male female gender ; relationships parent ; interest parent ; overall adjustment . Part 3 study consist neuropsychological testing study site . This test focus memory , attention , overall cognitive ability .</detailed_description>
