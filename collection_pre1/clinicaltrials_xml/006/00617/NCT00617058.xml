Height , weight , body fat , various blood test indicative general health collect 6 month trial monitor health benefit safety intervention . SGAs associate concern degree weight gain metabolic consequence . Children adolescent , SGAs use increasingly wide variety condition , particularly vulnerable side effect , adversely affect health longevity . It imperative researcher evaluate efficacy safety intervention design prevent treat weight gain metabolic problem cause antipsychotic treatment child .
