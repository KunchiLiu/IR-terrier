	<brief_summary>The main objective study ass whether recently-developed bioassay protein FGL2 use predict progression and/or response treatment Hepatitis C Virus disease patient chronic HCV infection . The hypothesis increase level FGL2 increase number T regulatory cell associate failure respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FGL2/Fibroleukin Hepatitis C Virus Infection : A Predictor Response Antiviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current therapy chronic Hepatitis C Virus infection lead sustain viral response 50 % treated patient . Evidence suggest poor response treatment may result dysfunction immunoregulatory mediator include T regulatory cell ( Tregs ) secrete FGL2 . The aim study test whether serum FGL2 level serve biomarker clinical progress treatment response patient undergoing anti-viral therapy chronic HCV infection . This study measure blood Treg FGL2 level patient chronic Hepatitis C undergo antiviral therapy compare level pre-treatment post-treatment level . Treg FGL2 expression level also measure patient ' liver biopsy tissue available . Additionally , study examine main form ( ) Fc Receptor express patient . The Fc receptor hypothesize binding partner FGL2 , form express give patient may determine downstream effect FGL2 's binding . These data along clinical , biochemical virological data use determine whether correlation FGL2 level disease outcome and/or treatment response . The study also recruit group normal healthy volunteer give blood sample two occasion baseline range FGL2 level healthy individual establish comparison .</detailed_description>
