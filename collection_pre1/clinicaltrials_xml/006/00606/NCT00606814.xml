	<brief_summary>This study Phase I clinical trial IPI-504 combination docetaxel ( Taxotere ) .The purpose study determine : - safety profile , - high dose IPI-504 give docetaxel without cause severe side effect , - recommend Phase II dose combination patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study IPI-504 Docetaxel Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPI-504 novel small molecule inhibitor heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) , emerge recently identify target cancer therapy . Hsp90 protein chaperone play central role maintain proper folding , function viability various `` client protein '' . Many client protein stabilize Hsp90 oncoproteins cell-signaling protein important cancer cell proliferation cancer cell survival . This multi-center , open-label , dose escalate study patient treat fix dose docetaxel follow IPI-504 follow one three dose schedule . Once MTD define , 20 additional patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) enrol .</detailed_description>

Measurable disease RECIST criterion exception prostate cancer patient . &gt; 18 year age time sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) life expectancy least 3 month . Karnofsky performance status 70 well . Adhere study visit schedule Voluntarily sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Baseline study complete within 30 day first study dose . Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week first study dose prior additional cycle treatment . All WCBP sexually active male patient must agree use adequate method birth control throughout study ** Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) enrol Expansion Phase study must meet following additional inclusion criterion : NSCLC meet disease criterion describe first three Inclusion Criteria . Must archival NSCLC tissue available submission analysis . Treatment within 1 week start IPI504 erlotinib , imatinib ; within 2 week gefitinib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( approved investigational ) ; within 4 week biologic therapy ( antibody , vaccine , proteinbased therapy ) , radiation therapy , conventional chemotherapy ; within 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C. Radiation therapy within 2 week start IPI504 . ( Patients must recover toxicity . ) Concurrent radiation therapy treatment investigational agent permit . Use medication food clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitor inducer within 2 week prior Cycle 1 , Dose 1 . Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy â‰¥ Grade 2 . Inadequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3 , platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL ( may increase level transfusion long evidence active bleeding ) . Inadequate renal function define AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 ; total bilirubin upper limit normal . Inadequate renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN . Sinus bradycardia ( rest heart rate &lt; 50 ) secondary intrinsic conduction system disease . Patients sinus bradycardia secondary pharmacologic treatment may enroll withdrawal treatment result normalization rest heart rate within normal limit . Baseline QTc &gt; 450 msec male ; QTc &gt; 470 msec female , previous history QT prolongation take medication . Presence leave bundle branch block , right bundle branch block plus leave anterior hemiblock , bifasicular block 3rd degree heart block . This include patient history event adequate control pacemaker . Patients receive &gt; 450 mg/m2 anthracycline prior chemotherapy must baseline LVEF &gt; 40 % . Active keratitis keratoconjunctivitis . History severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Presence active infection systemic use antibiotic within 72 hour treatment . Untreated brain metastasis . Note : Patients history brain metastasis eligible long definitive treatment give patient clinically stable . Significant comorbid condition disease judgment Investigator would place patient undue risk interfere study ( e.g. , cardiac disease acute coronary syndrome unstable angina within 6 month , uncontrolled hypertension , arrhythmia require medication mechanical control , cirrhotic liver disease , condition ) . Previous current malignancy sit within last 2 year , exception adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy . Women pregnant lactating . Previous treatment 17AAG , DMAG , know Hsp90 inhibitor . Patients prior hepatic resection hepaticdirected therapy ( e.g. , chemoembolization Theresphere ) . **Patients nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) enrol Expansion Phase study must meet following additional exclusion criterion : Prior treatment docetaxel Three chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Note : Any number prior treatment regimen tyrosine kinase inhibitor permit .</criteria>
