	<brief_summary>We ask patient take part study recurrent ( return ) ( 1st 2nd ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . The purpose study : - To see Sutent change patient cancer . - To see Sutent slow stop growth tumor . - To measure safety Sutent . Sutent Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treat patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor disease worsen take another medicine call imatinib mesylate imatinib mesylate take . Sutent also FDA approve treat patient advance renal cell carcinoma . At time , know whether Sutent improve symptom , help patient disease live longer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial patient receive sunitinib 50 mg daily 4 week without regard meal , follow 2-week rest period . This 6-week regimen constitute 1 cycle . Patients treat 9 cycle [ ~ year ) disease progression death persistent toxicity occur . Complete blood count differential , complete metabolic profile , neurologic exam , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contrast obtained cycle . Toxicity assessment obtain cycle . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) , version 3.0 . SCHEDULE OF EVENTS - PROTOCOL ACTIVITIES &lt; 14 Days Prior Initial Study Treatment : - Neurological/Oncological History - Neurological Examination - Height/Weight/Body Surface Area - Performance Status - Quality Life ( QOL ) FACT-L - Laboratory Studies ; complete blood count ( CBC ) , Differential , Platelets , prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time ( PT/PTT ) , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , Serum Creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , Total Bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ( AlkPHs ) , Pregnancy Test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - Cranial MRI CT without contrast - Multiple uptake gate acquisition ( MUGA ) Scan Day 1 , At Beginning Each Treatment Cycle : - Adverse Event Assessment - Laboratory Studies ; CBC , Differential , Platelets Every Cycle , Days 42-45 ( within 3 day next scheduled Sutent treatment ) : - Neurological/Oncological History - Neurological Examination - Height/Weight/Body Surface Area - Performance Status - QOL FACT-L - Laboratory Studies ; Serum Creatinine , BUN , ALT , AST , LDH , Total Bilirubin , AlkPHs - Cranial MRI CT without contrast - Survival At Off Study : - Performance Status - Cranial MRI CT without contrast - Survival</detailed_description>
