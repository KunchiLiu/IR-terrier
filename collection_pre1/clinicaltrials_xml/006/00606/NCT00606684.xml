	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrollment study must meet following criterion : Informed Consent : Subjects give sign write informed consent participate . Gender : Male female 40 80 year age Visit 1 . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal ) ; Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e . accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen followup contact ) : Complete abstinence intercourse screen 2 week followup contact ; Male partner sterile ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject entry study , male partner sole partner subject ; Implants levonorgestrel insert least 1 month prior study medication administration beyond third successive year follow insertion ; Injectable progestogen administer least 1 month prior study medication administration administer 1 month follow study completion ; Oral contraceptive ( combine progestogen ) administer least one monthly cycle prior study medication administration ; Double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) plus spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) ; An intrauterine device ( IUD ) , insert qualified physician , publish data show high expected failure rate le 1 % per year ; Estrogenic vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch COPD Diagnosis : Subjects establish clinical history COPD accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [ Celli , 2004 ] : COPD preventable treatable disease characterise airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . Tobacco Use : Must current prior history least 10 packyears cigarette smoking . [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ] . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Severity Disease : Subjects measure postsalbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio ≤0.70 Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Subjects measure postsalbutamol FEV1 ≥35 ≤70 % predict normal value calculate use NHANES III reference equation Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol study : Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactating . Asthma : Subjects primary diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible COPD currently primary diagnosis ) a1antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects a1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Other Respiratory disorder : Subjects active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Lung Resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within previous 12 month . Chest Xray : Chest Xray ( CT scan ) reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest xray must take chest xray CT scan available within 6 month precede Screening Visit . For site Germany , chest xray ( CT scan ) available 6 month precede Screening ( Visit 1 ) , subject eligible study . Hospitalization : Subjects hospitalize due poorly control COPD within 12 week screen visit . Poorly control COPD : Subjects poorly control COPD , define occurrence follow 6 week prior Visit 1 : acute worsen COPD manage subject corticosteroid antibiotic , acute worsen COPD require treatment prescribed physician Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Subjects clinically significant cardiovascular neurological , psychiatric , renal , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) hematological abnormality uncontrolled . Lower Respiratory Tract Infection : Subjects low respiratory tract infection require use antibiotic within 6 week prior visit 1 . 12Lead ECG : An abnormal clinically significant 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) result active medical problem . For purpose study , abnormal ECG define 12lead tracing interpret ( limit ) follow : Clinically significant conduction abnormality ( e.g. , leave bundle branch block , WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome ) Clinically significant arrhythmia ( e.g. , atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ) The investigator determine clinical significance ECG abnormality determine subject preclude enter study . However , follow predetermine ECG abnormality consider clinically significant result exclusion subject : A mean QTc ( B ) value screen &gt; 450msec , uncorrected QT &gt; 600msec ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination T wave ) Ventricular rate &lt; 45 beat per minute . PR interval &gt; 240msec . Evidence second third degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block Pathological Q wave Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay STT wave abnormality ( exclude nonspecific STT wave abnormality ) Right leave complete bundle branch block Hypertension : Subjects clinically significant hypertension uncontrolled . Hepatitis : Subjects positive Hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C antibody prestudy Screening . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma would exclude subject consider cure less 5 year since diagnosis . Drug allergy : Subjects history hypersensitivity betaagonist component MDI and/or nebule sensitivity constituent dry powder product ( magnesium stearate lactose ) . In addition patient history severe milk protein allergy would also exclude . Drug abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold salbutamol 6 hour period require prior spirometry test study visit would ineligible study . Additional Medications : The following medication permit study must take indicated time prior Visit 1 ( See Prohibited Medications ) : Medication ( Required period time prior screen visit ) : Ipratropium ipratropium/salbutamol combination product ( 6 hour ) Inhaled short acting betaagonists ( study salbutamol provide ) ( 6 hour ) Oral beta2agonists ( 48 hour ) LABAs ( salmeterol formoterol ) ( 48 hour ) Corticosteroids/Long act betaagonist combination product ( 48 hour LABA component ) Theophylline preparation ( 48 hour ) Cromolyn nedocromil inhaler ( 24 hour ) Zafirlukast , montelukast , zileuton ( 48 hour ) Tiotropium ( 1 Week ) Depot corticosteroid ( 12 Weeks ) Intraarticular corticosteroid ( 24 hour ) Inhaled corticosteroid &gt; 1000mcg/day fluticasone propionate equivalent ( 4 Weeks ) Any investigational medication ( 30 day within 5 drug halflives investigational drug ( whichever longer ) ) Pglycoprotein inhibitor ( e.g. , ritonavir , ketoconazole ) Cytochrome P 3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , cimetidine ) ( 4 week ( grapefruit allow screen visit ) ) Other Medications : Subjects receive treatment tricyclic antidepressant , MAOs , betaadrenergic antagonist , anticonvulsant ( barbiturate , hydantoin , carbamazepine ) phenothiazine would ineligible study . Oxygen : Subjects receive longtermoxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen prn use exclusionary . Sleep apnea : Subjects clinically significant sleep apnea uncontrolled . Pulmonary Rehabilitation : Subjects participate acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 week prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) enter acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program study . Subjects maintenance phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation program exclude . Noncompliance : Subjects unable comply study procedure . Affiliation investigator site : Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator immediate family member aforementioned excluded participation study . Questionable validity Consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation , substance abuse , ( include drug alcohol ) , condition , limit validity inform consent participate study . Prior use Study Medication : Subjects receive investigational drug GW642444 previous study .</criteria>
