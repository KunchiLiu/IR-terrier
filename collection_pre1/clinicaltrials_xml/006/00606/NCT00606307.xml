	<brief_summary>In recent year several report document Histone Deacetylases ( HDACs ) inhibitor induce neoplastic cell undergo growth arrest , differentiation and/or apoptotic cell death . Recently , inhibitor HDACs also show inhibit endothelial cell proliferation angiogenesis vivo . Several HDAC-inhibitors currently clinical trial novel anticancer agent . Among agent , ITF2357 recently show potent inhibitor autonomous proliferation haematopoietic cell patient myeloproliferative disorder carry JAK2 V617F mutation . The aim present study evaluate efficacy safety ITF2357 treatment polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) myelofibrosis ( MF )</brief_summary>
