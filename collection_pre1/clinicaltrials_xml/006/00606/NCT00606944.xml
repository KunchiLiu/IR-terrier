	<brief_title>Fast-track Rehabilitation After Elective Colorectal Small Bowel Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally , patient receive laparoscopic colorectal surgery treat classical protocol include use naso-gastric tube starvation several postoperative day till recovery bowel movement , bed rest immediate postoperative period follow ward ambulation postoperative day 1 2 . Restarting oral alimentation base gas feces reappearance surgery usually possible several day follow surgery . However , prolonged starvation might uncomfortable patient well increase postoperative hospital stay . Recently , several study report efficacy early rehabilitation protocol intestinal surgery , show early oral alimentation could reduce length hospital stay cost hospitalization without significant increase postoperative complication , compare traditional management . This prospective , randomize study design evaluate effectiveness postoperative care pathway use rehabilitation early ambulation diet patient undergo elective laparoscopic colorectal resection compare traditional postoperative care . In order conduct study , patient laparoscopic colon resection randomly attribute enhanced recovery program group control group , divide base postoperative management protocol .</detailed_description>
