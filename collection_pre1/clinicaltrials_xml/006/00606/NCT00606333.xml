	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Conor Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System treatment coronary artery disease ( single atherosclerotic lesion ) native coronary artery . The study evaluate outcome new drug-eluting stent compare approve drug-eluting stent . While Cordis make business decision long pursue NEVOâ„¢ development commercialization , patient follow per protocol . This include perform protocol require follow-up visit collection report safety information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Conor Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent Taxus Liberte Paclitaxel-eluting Coronary Stent Treatment Coronary Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis remain frequent cause late failure follow successful coronary angioplasty occur estimate 20-40 % procedure perform . Coronary stent provide mechanical scaffolding help reduce restenosis limit extent elastic recoil late vascular remodel . Despite improvement balloon angioplasty alone , restenosis follow coronary stenting procedure cite occur 20-40 % case primarily result neointimal hyperplasia . Thus , stent capable deliver drug limit neointimal hyperplasia , addition provide mechanical support area lesion , develop limit extent restenosis follow coronary stenting . There several pharmacologic agent approve use drug-eluting stents.Two drug widely study controlled clinical trial real-world patient population , sirolimus paclitaxel . This study evaluate new sirolimus-eluting cobalt chromium coronary stent system compare approve paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system treatment single de novo coronary lesion native coronary artery . Subjects meet qualification randomize 1:1 fashion treatment Conor sirolimus-eluting coronary stent treatment approve paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent . All subject undergo angiographic follow-up six month complete clinical follow-up period five year .</detailed_description>
