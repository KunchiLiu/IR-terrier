	<brief_summary>Medications single common form treatment long-term care setting , often represent efficacious ( cost-effective ) therapeutic modality use clinical setting . However , resident nurse home increase risk experience adverse drug event . This risk increase physiologic decline pharmacologic change occur age , also special clinical social circumstance characterize institutional long-term care . In study fund National Institute Aging ( AG 14472 ) , previously determine adverse drug event common often preventable nursing home set serious adverse drug event , likely preventable . This study test whether computer-based clinical decision support system lower rate adverse drug event ( ADEs ) potential ADEs long-term care set . The study design randomize trial base resident care unit two large long-term care facility . Within facility , half resident care unit randomize intervention arm receive computer-based clinical decision support system display warning , message , prompt base resident drug use characteristic ; over-rides prescriber require warning . Rates ADEs potential ADEs track study 's on-site clinical pharmacist prior intervention period . Rates compare unit receive receive computerÂ¬based clinical decision support system baseline , pre-intervention rate unit . We track project cost directly relate development installation computer-based clinical decision support system . We also develop test sensitivity specificity computerized adverse drug event monitor assess validity nursing home resident risk model develop prior study adverse drug event nurse home setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct two large , academic long-term care facility locate Connecticut Ontario , Canada . The two facility combine total 1,229 bed . Patients reside area facility relate short-term care ( e.g. , subacute care , hospital-level care , rehabilitation ) include study population . Each facility exist computerized provider order entry system without computer-based clinical decision support system . At time study , approximately 90 % new medication order enter use system . All medication prescribe perform contracted staff ; one study facility include 27 physician , nurse practitioner , physician ' assistant . In facility , medication prescribing perform 10 physician . Across two long-term care facility , 26 resident care unit , exist computer provider order entry , randomize clinical decision support system ( intervention unit ) ( control unit ) . Bed size resident care unit range 20 60 bed . An effort make match unit accord bed size general characteristic resident unit . We block randomize within category include : dementia unit , unit mental health behavioral problem common among resident , unit resident complex medical need , unit resident profound deficit physical function . On intervention unit , prescribers order drug present alert form warn message ; alert display prescribers order medication resident control unit . Although effort initially make limit crossover prescribers intervention control unit , duration study , provider work simultaneously type unit , temporary ( coverage ) basis also permanently . The clinical decision support system design team geriatrician , pharmacist , health service researcher , information system specialist ; process develop clinical decision support system component describe previously . The design principle : 1 ) message evidence-based ; 2 ) message perceive useful informative practitioner ; 3 ) system modest impact time require practitioner complete order . The team review type preventable adverse drug event base previous research , well widely accept publish criterion suboptimal prescribe elderly available time study . We also review serious drug-drug interaction standard pharmaceutical drug interaction database include alert limit number 600 potentially serious interaction review . Reasons exclusion alert specific drug interaction include medication formulary facility , medication generally never use elderly patient long-term care set . The clinical decision support system design provide alert response select drug order whenever order : 1 ) involve select high-severity drug interaction ; 2 ) patient select abnormal lab test result suggest possible danger relate use ordered medication ; 3 ) could lead adverse effect require special monitoring order identify early ; 4 ) relate medication order within certain dose range reduce risk adverse effect elderly patient ; 5 ) accompany prophylactic measure proactively address situation high likelihood adverse drug effect ( e.g. , constipation opioid use ) . Alerts include specific instruction laboratory monitoring , well less explicit recommendation reconsider drug order monitor possible side effect . A summary alert provide appendix . The computerized provider order entry system place time clinical decision support system implementation capable link laboratory test order result current drug order real-time . However , system several important limitation , describe previously . It capable combine dose strength information determine total daily dose associate drug order ; therefore , alert display may necessary ( e.g. , medication order already within recommend dose range ) . The underlie software capable distinguish multiple order drug different form strength , order cancel re-ordered within prescribe session . These order interpret multiple order drug category trigger number inappropriate alert drug interaction . For example , order erythromycin prescriber initiate , cancel , re-ordered within order session would interpret interaction signal need alert increase risk QT prolongation . Despite fact trigger likely produce substantial number unnecessary alert , opt include system potential impact type drug interaction question consider clinically important . For resident intervention unit , alert display pop-up box prescribers real-time drug order enter . The pop-up box informational ; require specific action prescriber produce revise order automatically . On control unit , alert display prescribers . Our study limit adverse drug event occur long-term care set . Drug-related incident identify review medical record monthly segment perform trained pharmacist investigator eligible long-term care facility resident . These investigator , aware whether resident locate intervention control unit , examine record possible drug-related incident , new symptom event might represent adverse drug event , change medication regimen ( include acute discontinuation initiation medication might use treat drug-induced event ) , abnormal laboratory value , emergency room transfer hospitalization . In addition periodic review , medical record specially target review base information derive select computer-generated signal include abnormal serum drug level , abnormal laboratory result , use medication consider antidote adverse drug effect . Administrative incident report generate within participate facility also review indication drug-related incident . The primary outcome study adverse drug event , define injury result use drug . This definition consistent definition use previous study . Adverse drug event may result medication error ( e.g. , error order , dispense , administration , monitor ) adverse drug reaction error . As described previously , between-pharmacist investigator reliability identify relevant incident medical record assess independent review 10 medical record two pharmacist . Each identify incident 10 medical record ; one pharmacist identify additional incident one record pre-specified incident warrant review . The possible drug-related incident present pharmacist investigator pair physician-reviewers ( JHG , JJ , PR , LRH , CB ) . These physician-reviewers independently classify incident use structure implicit review accord follow criterion : whether adverse drug event present , severity event , whether event preventable . In determine whether adverse drug event occur , physician-reviewers consider temporal relation drug exposure event , well whether event reflect known effect drug . This structure implicit review process use numerous prior study relate adverse drug event across various clinical setting . Physician reviewer aware whether drug-related incident review occurred resident intervention control unit . The severity adverse event categorize less serious , serious , life-threatening , fatal . Adverse drug event categorize less serious include non-urticarial skin rash , fall without associated fracture , hemorrhage require transfusion hospitalization , oversedation . Examples event categorize serious include urticaria , fall associated fracture , hemorrhage require transfusion hospitalization without hypotension , delirium . Examples life-threatening event include hemorrhage associate hypotension , hypoglycemic encephalopathy , acute renal failure . Adverse drug event consider preventable judged due error preventable mean available relation clinical decision support system . For purpose analysis effect intervention , event characterize serious great severity , categorize severe . All event consider less severe . Preventability categorize preventable , probably preventable , probably preventable , definitely preventable ; result collapse preventable ( preventable probably preventable ) nonpreventable ( probably preventable definitely preventable ) category analysis . When physician-reviewers disagree classification incident regard presence adverse drug event , severity , preventability , meet reach consensus ; consensus reach instance initial disagreement .</detailed_description>
