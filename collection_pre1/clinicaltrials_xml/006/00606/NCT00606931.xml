	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot clinical study test methodology use high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image guide vacuum-assisted core biopsy breast abnormality identify PET . In order implement PET guidance , study us Stereo Navigator accessory high-resolution organ-specific PET scanner ( PEM Flex™ PET Scanner , Naviscan PET Systems , Inc. , San Diego , CA ) . The Stereo Navigator investigational device intend guide biopsy needle toward lesion breast identify physician high resolution PET image . The study evaluate clinical utility Stereo Navigator guide vacuum-assisted core biopsy breast abnormality , follow example prior study breast biopsy guide magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate High Resolution PET Image-Guidance Sampling Breast Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study invite participation human subject newly diagnose suspect breast cancer one breast abnormality moderately suspicious highly suggestive malignancy breast image require biopsy ( lesion ( ) interest ) . Prospective subject ask sign IRB-approved consent form , explain use PET image guide biopsy suspicious lesion ( ) . Up 30 patient recruit study . The study terminate approximately 20 subject undergo PET-guided interventional procedure . In course study , subject inject 18F-FDG imaged use PEM Flex PET scanner . Once abnormality require biopsy identify PET scan , physician conducting procedure use PET image plan biopsy trajectory use Stereo Navigator Software Module , use Stereo Navigator Needle Guide Holder guide insertion introduce stylet toward lesion . The sampling perform use commercially available core biopsy tool routinely use MRI-guided biopsy.Immediately PET-guided biopsy , conventional biopsy marker insert biopsy site ( ) correlation image modality . Placement biopsy marker document use mammography , per standard clinical practice . Histopathologic result correlate imaging finding . The procedure may repeat additional lesion identify PET investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals age 25 year old Individuals least one breast image find require biopsy , specifically : Individuals breast abnormality ( y ) moderately suspicious highly suggestive malignancy image mammography , ultrasound , MRI ( per ACR BIRADS™ 4C 5 ) require biopsy confirmation OR Individuals know breast cancer additional imaging abnormality ( y ) suspicious malignancy detect highresolution FDG PET scan Individuals recent conventional imaging workup include xray mammography breast contain abnormality interest . Individuals suspect tumor size measure one cm less mammography and/or ultrasound and/or MRI lesion visible modality , except site may enroll three patient lesion interest measure mammography ( ultrasound and/or MRI detectable mammography ) 1 cm . ( Note : The study target patient enrollment least 50 % lesion undergo biopsy across site le 1 cm diameter measure mammography , measure modality , ultrasound , CT , MRI , lesion detectable measurable mammography . ) Individuals agree participate study sign studyspecific inform consent Women may pregnant Women currently lactate discontinue breastfeed &lt; 2 month prior study Age le 25 year Individuals breast implant ( ) breast contain lesion interest Individuals schedule sentinel node procedure use radioactive Tc99m within 24 hour PETguided biopsy Patients contraindication core biopsy invasive procedure blood coagulation disorder , infection , unwilling discontinue use anticoagulant medication prior procedure Individuals Type I poorly control Type II diabetes mellitus Individuals blood glucose level 140 mg/dl time PEM image Inability provide inform consent Individuals surgery study breast ( ) within past 12 month</criteria>
