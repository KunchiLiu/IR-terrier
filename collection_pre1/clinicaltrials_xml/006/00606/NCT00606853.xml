For patient initiate treatment cocaine-positive urine specimen , evaluate efficacy two CM procedure relative standard , non-CM treatment . The two CM procedure provide addition standard care reinforce drug abstinence differ expect magnitude prize patient earn , especially early stage abstinence . They provide expect magnitude win $ 250 $ 560 , respectively . We expect CM condition improve retention abstinence relative standard treatment , non-CM condition . If enhance CM condition engenders well outcomes $ 250 CM condition , find would suggest patient initiate treatment actively use cocaine may best treat relatively high reinforcement prize CM adjunct standard care . For patient initiate treatment cocaine-negative urine specimen , evaluate efficacy CM procedure reinforces treatment attendance . The expected magnitude winning $ 250 , CM treatment addition standard care . This CM condition compare standard treatment without CM well CM treatment provide similar magnitude reinforcement , contingent upon abstinence .
