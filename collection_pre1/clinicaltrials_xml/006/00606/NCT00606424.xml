	<brief_summary>[ F-18 ] HX4 develop diagnostic radiopharmaceutical PET imaging . This trial look safety [ F-18 ] HX4 . The Sponsor seek determine [ F-18 ] HX4 may serve clinically useful hypoxia marker diagnostic imaging , allow rational application hypoxia related therapy patient likely benefit . Tumor hypoxia , situation tumor cell deprive oxygen , cause cancer cell become resistant effect radiotherapy chemotherapy . A non-invasive study characterize tumor hypoxia would facilitate development target therapy . The population study consist total ten ( 10 ) adult subject , include , four normal volunteer six cancer subject , latter confirm diagnosis head neck cancer , define protocol eligibility criterion . The objective exploratory study : - Gain information bio-distribution [ F-18 ] HX4 , evaluate PET image [ F-18 ] HX4 resolution , signal background ratio intermediate level oxygenation , extreme level hypoxia - Use eIND order obtain necessary information file IND application FDA . The information collect exploratory study use diagnostic purpose , ass subject 's response therapy , clinical management subject . - Begin collection baseline image data - Collect [ F-18 ] HX4 metabolism data - Gain information improve study design conduct future trial This investigation conduct exploratory , open-label , non-randomized , uncontrolled , single center , safety study . The trial expect begin subject enrollment early January 2008 end subject participation June 2008 . The duration individual subject 's participation include screen visit , follow participation actual study start day dose imaging session last several hour , conclude next day safety follow-up visit . Individual dos [ F-18 ] HX4 shall exceed 20 mCi . The IP administer previously place suitably size angiocatheter butterfly needle . Prior injection , qualify site personnel assay dose . After IP administration several PET image series acquire . Also , order ass major organ function electrolyte level , metabolite analysis perform study predose 90 minute postdose . In order determine quantity [ F-18 ] HX4 label metabolite excrete kidney , urine collect pool designated interval administration investigational product . This excretion data provide supportive information calculate human dosimetry estimate PET image biodistribution data collect human subject . For cancer subject , tissue biopsy take schedule perform . The biopsy sample examine hypoxic biomarker ( ) use immunohistochemistry method .</brief_summary>
