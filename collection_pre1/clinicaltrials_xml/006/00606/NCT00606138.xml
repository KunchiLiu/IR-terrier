	<brief_summary>Diabetic neovascularization refers type diabetic retinopathy worsen abnormal growth blood vessel back eye , damage retina . The usual treatment type laser , call panretinal photocoagulation . One drawback amount space within eye use treatment eventually limit , use near part retina use detailed vision ( macula ) . In similar eye disorder , certain injectable medication call anti-VEGF treatment slow stop abnormal blood vessel growth . This study seek compare use ranibizumab versus standard panretinal photocoagulation treatment diabetic neovascularization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Treatment Persistent Diabetic Neovascularization Assessed Wide-Field Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose compare efficacy ranibizumab versus additional panretinal photocoagulation diabetic neovascularization persistent despite previous treatment panretinal photocoagulation . We hypothesize ranibizumab intravitreal injection would induce neovascular regression similar good fashion supplemental laser photocoagulation . Consented , enrolled subject either receive open-label intravitreal injection 0.5-mg dose ranibizumab additional panretinal photocoagulation ( 500 300-500 um laser spot ) ratio two-to-one ( 2:1 ) begin study period . ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , Optos color photography perform enrollment , week 1 , 2 , 3 4 , month 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 . The subject undergo fluorescein angiography utilize Optomap FA ( fluorescein angiography ) system optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) enrollment , week 2 4 , month 2 , 3 , 4 6 . The subject follow 6-month period stabilization , regression , recurrence neovascularization . In addition , patient evaluate occurrence macular edema .</detailed_description>
