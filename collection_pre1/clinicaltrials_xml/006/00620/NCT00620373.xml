	<brief_title>Molecular Breast Imaging Screening Tool Women With Dense Breasts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sensitivity conventional mammography ( MMO ) poor woman mammographically dense breast parenchyma . We develop Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) - new technique utilizes Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride ( CZT ) gamma camera scintimammography high sensitivity ( ~90 % ) detection breast cancer independent breast density . The aim study demonstrate utility MBI adjunct screen modality detection occult breast cancer woman mammographically dense breast tissue . Initial recruitment pool patient await screen mammogram Department Radiology Mayo Clinic Rochester . All patient screen MMO MBI study . Patients positive study ( MBI MMO ) undergo additional diagnostic study . At 15 month post-recruitment , patient contact phone mail determine whether subsequent study , change breast status .</detailed_description>
