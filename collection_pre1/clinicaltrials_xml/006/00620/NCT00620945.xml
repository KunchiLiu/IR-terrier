	<detailed_description>Background Cardiopulmonary bypass [ CPB ] small size body result decreased peripheral perfusion . This result anaerobic metabolism evidence lactic acidosis . High flow result systemic hypertension accentuate moderate hypothermia commonly use cardiopulmonary bypass . Phenoxybenzamine [ PBZ ] arteriolar vasodilator act irreversibly block alpha adrenergic receptor . It cause vasodilatation allow high flow , low pressure CPB . It use extensively outside US Canada , Europe Australia . In US oral PBZ FDA approve , whereas intravenous PBZ available investigational drug . At Cleveland Clinic medication use protocol since 1994 &gt; 1000 without significant serious adverse outcome . The drug also use Texas Children 's Hospital , Hospital Sick Children Toronto , Children 's Hospital Wisconsin number center throughout Europe , Australia Asia . The drug help reduce mortality child undergo cardiopulmonary bypass . The theoretic benefit PBZ patient population uniform smooth reduction fo systemic vascular resistance perioperative period . This uniform systemic vasodilation allow low pressure , high flow systemic perfusion cardiopulmonary bypass . We feel in part responsible improve outcome cardiopulmonary bypass , include less end-organ edema formation dysfunction . Due experience center strongly believe use PBZ bypass management protocol patient represent state-of-the-art experimental investigation . Since US drug available except investigational drug , require use investigational new drug [ IND ] PBZ [ oral ] currently use US management pheochromocytoma . It prove track record know safe . Use large number patient worldwide show serious side-effects except hypotension [ effect indeed ] require norepinephrine [ alpha agonist commonly use cardiopulmonary bypass patient anyway ] . Patients The following patient candidate receive PBZ HFLPP . These include : 1 . All patient 16 kg . 2 . Those patient 16-18 kg whose pre bypass hemoglobin &lt; 16 g/dl 3 . All patient le 18 year age . Use Phenoxybenzamine : Loading dose give time go CPB : - For patient obstruct lesion systemic side : - 0.25 mg/kg dose bypass circuit - None intravenous - For patient without obstruct left side lesion : - 0.5 mg/kg bypass circuit - 0.5 mg/kg I.V . cannulation Maintenance dose give post-operative period : - 0.3 mg/kg I.V . every 8 hour till oral intake start first 48 hour - 0.3 mg/kg P.O . every 8 hour next 24 hour - 0.15 mg/kg P.O . every 8 hour next 24 hour stop - Hold PBZ patient norepinephrine infusion mean arterial pressure lower allow age group - Do use maintenance dose follow patient unless maximum dose sodium nitroprusside infusion still hypertensive : - Norwood patient - Fontan patient - Patients residual leave ventricular obstructive lesion - n't use post operative period Data collect monitor purpose study : Demographic information , side effect mortality data would record keep password protect computer secure-access-only physician office . Only composite data without individual identifier report IRB FDA . No publication plan study follow-up do patient discharge hospital . Side effect monitor : - Hypotension require norepinephrine excess usual dose [ 0.2 micrograms/kg/min ] - Death hypotension absence cause [ bleeding , sepsis ] - Effects occur within 12 hour I.V . dose administration within 24 hour P.O . dose administration - Any unanticipated unusual side effect [ none note since 1994 ] Consent Informed consent would obtain parents/guardians patient . Assent obtain child &gt; 7 year age .</detailed_description>
