	<brief_summary>The purpose study use new combination anesthesia technique attempt minimize early pain surgery improve patient 's ability participate fully physical therapy . Total knee replacement patient participate receive standard anesthesia . This include spinal nerve block well femoral nerve block . The study look add benefit include injection numb medication ( Bupivicaine ) back knee . This injection occur surgery . In order compare outcome also group patient receive saline injection oppose numbing medication . Patients randomly assign group . Outcomes measure twenty-four hour follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Intra-Operative Intracapsular Blocks Post-Operative Pain Management Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Summary Purpose Study This prospective , randomize , blind control trial conduct evaluate post-operative pain control physical therapy outcome primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) use spinal analgesia intra-operative posterior capsular injection ropivicaine 0.5 % conjunction continuous femoral nerve catheter . We believe result study show improvement pain control physical therapy outcome compare traditional method analgesia post-op total knee arthroplasty . To best knowledge , study literature use combination femoral nerve analgesia posterior capsular injection . Certainly regional anesthesia method femoral nerve block use alone conjunction sciatic nerve block improve patient pain outcome measure total knee arthroplasty . Several study show beneficial effect intra-articular analgesia capsular closure . We believe study design combine beneficial effect aforementioned method , ultimately improve patient pain , therapy effort , safety less narcotic use . Our goal share result peer-reviewed journal , national orthopaedic anesthesia meeting . The data collect ideally improve care safety post-operative total knee arthroplasty patient . Background Significance Post-operative pain control total knee arthroplasty area great study orthopaedic surgery anesthesia literature . The use spinal/epidural alone combination regional anesthesia well studied recent literature . These technique significantly improve patient pain management , physical/occupational therapy outcome , shorten time discharge . Additionally , intra-articular injection local anesthetic capsular closure study recently . Several study demonstrate beneficial effect intra-articular local anesthetic pain outcome measure ( 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 15 ) . Although study report equivocal result . The impact capsular analgesia post-operative pain intriguing . Decreased afferent pain perception capsular nerve local anesthetic may improve outcome , especially sensory distribution regional anesthesia inadequate perform . Much study center regional anesthesia , specifically use single shot continuous femoral nerve blockade ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 14 , 16 ) . Such study demonstrate statistically significant decrease total narcotic use , sedation score , visual analog pain score . Femoral nerve blockade accept method post-op pain control total knee arthroplasty patient . Further investigation center addition sciatic nerve blockade femoral nerve block ( 1-3 , 7 , 12 , 13 ) . Several study demonstrate improvement pain outcome compare isolated femoral nerve anesthesia . Sciatic nerve block slow physical therapy effort secondary dense motor blockade . Equivocal result report study due motor block , however , sensory component appear provide improve pain outcome measure . Femoral nerve blockade well-accepted modality analgesia total knee arthroplasty . However , femoral nerve block alone provide adequate anesthesia posterior aspect knee . We believe intra-operative injection ropivicaine 0.5 % posterior capsule provide analgesia analogous sensory component sciatic nerve block , eliminate limit effect motor blockade . The combination femoral nerve block intra-operative posterior capsular injection ideally yield improve pain management physical therapy effort baseline femoral nerve block . Design procedures This prospective double-blinded , randomized trial consist two study group : posterior capsular saline injection ( control ) , experimental posterior capsular ropivicaine 0.5 % injection group . All patient receive spinal anesthesia continuous femoral nerve block . Each group include 45 patient ( n = 90 patient ) . All patient elective primary total knee arthroplasty perform . No revision bilateral case include . Exclusion criterion include patient know allergy ropivicaine fentanyl , know history narcotic abuse chronic pain , know diagnosis peripheral neuropathy complex regional pain syndrome , significant impediment physical therapy participation . Following informed consent process , patient receive continuous femoral nerve block via catheter place experienced regional anesthesiologist institution . Each patient also receive spinal anesthesia intra-operative pain control . A standard midline skin incision medial para-patellar arthrotomy perform follow implantation either Next Gen ( Zimmer/Warsaw , IN ) , Natural Knee II ( Zimmer , Warsaw , IN ) , Posterior Femoral Component ( PFC ) Sigma ( DePuy , Warsaw , IN ) system . Prior surgery , patient randomize saline ropivicaine group . Both group receive respective injection prior implantation component . The posterior capsule knee divide four quadrant , receive saline ropivicaine injection per randomization . Safety measure include standard pre-injection aspiration check vascular blush intra-operative Doppler ultrasound identify vascular structure posterior knee . Additionally , anesthesiologist blind , he/she responsible assure appropriate medication use , closely monitor cardiac arrhythmia unlikely event intravascular injection occur . Post-operatively , standard bulky dress apply . All patient weight bear tolerated post-operative day 1 . A fentanyl PCA initiate PACU , continue post-operative day 2 . Dosing calculate base lean body mass . Continuous femoral nerve blockade continue post-operative day 2 well . Outcomes include total PCA narcotic use , visual analog pain scale diagram localize pain , Ramsey sedation score . This data collect following interval : PACU , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour post-operatively . We also measure post-operative day 1 knee range motion , total ambulation distance , time straight leg raise . A standard , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve , data collection sheet utilized . We hypothesize total post-operative narcotic use , visual analog pain score , Ramsey sedation score significantly low study group ( posterior capsular ropivicaine 0.5 % injection ) . Additionally , anticipate knee range motion , total ambulation distance , time straight leg raise significantly improve well .</detailed_description>
