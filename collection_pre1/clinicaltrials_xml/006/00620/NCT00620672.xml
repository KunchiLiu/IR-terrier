	<brief_summary>Polyunsaturated fatty acid know n-3 fatty acid essential dietary nutrient human , know important reduce risk certain disease , particularly relate neural system , cardiovascular system immune system . Among different n-3 fatty acid , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) present particularly high amount brain retina , accumulate large amount organ last trim fetal development first month birth . The n-3 fatty acid present diet linolenic acid find vegetable seed oil , DHA find animal tissue fat , fatty fish rich dietary source .

Information work others suggest DHA important pregnancy , however specific evidence lack show DHA status pregnant woman low , improvement DHA status Canadian woman pregnancy benefit early infant child development . There evidence infant vegan vegetarian , woman eat DHA risk developmental delay . The purpose study investigate whether dietary supplement DHA pregnancy effect infant birth weight , index infant growth , visual , mental motor skill development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , blind prospective study 2 group : placebo group supplement DHA . Women randomize 16 week gestation without knowledge dietary fatty acid intake . Only healthy woman expect deliver single infant know anticipated maternal fetal complication enrol . Maternal venous blood collect 16 36 week gestation use assess maternal DHA status effect DHA supplementation . Dietary information collect 16 36 week gestation determine usual fatty acid intake . Following delivery , fetal cord blood collect assess transfer DHA mother fetus . Breast milk sample collect breast feed mother 1 2 month postpartum . The mother -infant pair follow 18 month . Measures include visual acuity , language , motor mental development , growth dietary intake .</detailed_description>
