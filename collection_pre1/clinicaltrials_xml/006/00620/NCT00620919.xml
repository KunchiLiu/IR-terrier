	<brief_summary>1 . To assess effect RG1068 dose 0.2 mcg/kg intravenously ( IV ) diameter pancreatic duct use Multidetector Computed Tomography ( MDCT ) pancreas . 2 . To demonstrate RG1068-enhanced MDCT improve image quality pancreas patient chronic pancreatitis . 3 . To evaluate RG1068 enhance MDCT result improve delineation structural abnormality pancreatic duct compare non-enhanced MDCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secretin Enhanced Multidetector CT Pancreatography Evaluation Known Suspected Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multidetector Computed Tomography ( MDCT ) mainstay image patient acute chronic pancreatitis , suspect pancreatic neoplasm post-pancreatic surgery evaluation . The use multidetector row helical CT scanner sub-second gantry rotation , dramatically reduce scan acquisition time resultant improvement patient compliance image quality . The improved Z-axis ( isotropic ) resolution permit excellent image reconstruction , play critical role diagnosis stag pancreatic pathology , due anatomic layout pancreas vasculature . Fast scanning time enable acquisition multiple phase enhancement , paramount importance image pancreas [ 1 ] . Until relatively recently , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) primary diagnostic therapeutic modality assess patient suspect pancreatic disease abnormality . However , invasive procedure carry significant potential complication include acute pancreatitis , hemorrhage infection , well reaction contrast material premedications exposure radiation . In addition , success procedure - standpoint safety efficacy - highly dependent skill endoscopist [ 2 ] , cost ERCP relatively high . Secretin enhance MRCP ( S-MRCP ) extensively use assessment suspect pancreatic disease . Likewise , administration secretin intravenously patient undergo MDCT pancreas result improve distension pancreatic duct . The potential benefit would non-invasive evaluation pancreatic duct morphology . In patient suspected abnormality involve main duct side branch , improve distension duct likely improve diagnostic yield condition intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) cystic pancreatic neoplasm . This study undertake prospectively assess effectiveness RG1068-enhanced MDCT relative unenhanced MDCT . RG1068 synthetic human secretin pharmacological profile similar biological synthetic porcine secretin . Secretin 27-amino acid gastrointestinal peptide hormone produce S-cells duodenum response pH decrease cause passage partially digest food stomach intestine . RG1068 identical amino acid sequence naturally occur human secretin differs porcine secretin 2 amino acid .</detailed_description>
