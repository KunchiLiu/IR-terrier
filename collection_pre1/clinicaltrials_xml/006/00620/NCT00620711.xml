	<brief_title>Pilot Study Head Cooling Preterm Infants With Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) potentially devastate disease newborn central nervous system ( CNS ) . Portions CNS deprive oxygen blood flow period time may lead permanent brain injury manifest cerebral palsy well cognitive defect . Until recently treatment show effective preventing brain damage , even though demonstrated damage progressive window opportunity arrest evolve brain injury . However , May 2007 FDA approve first device specifically design ameliorate brain damage term baby HIE . This head cool device study Vanderbilt IRB protocol 990129 Brain Cooling treatment perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy . We thus eight year experience use device term infant . The result initial trial demonstrate successful reduction HIE induce brain injury 66 % control infants 55 % treated baby . There significant risk application device term baby keep cool 72 hour experience acute HIE event . The initial trial limited term baby concern premature infant would risk hypothermia induce problem hypoglycemia , coagulopathy . The concern hypothermia preterm infant remain limit consideration whole body cool population . We propose apply cool cap head preterm infant experience significant HIE injury maintain body temperature normal range ( 36.1-37° C rectally ) . Infants cool 72 hour track till discharge . Although feasibility study , participant also followed-up 6 , 12 24 month age .</detailed_description>

Intubated Age le 6 hour Signed informed consent parent / legal guardian Previous participant follow 7 day head ultrasound . Mild HIE cool , therefore baby without hypotonia lethargy baby intubate exclude . Gestational age ≥ 36 week &lt; 32 week less 1200 gram . Older 6 hour age Infant deem extremis clinical exam .
