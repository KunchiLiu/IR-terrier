	<brief_summary>Lactation ( breastfeed ) mastitis acute infection milk ducts breastfeed woman . Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) infectious germ commonly associate lactation mastitis . Twenty percent general population carrier Staphylococcus aureus , mean carry infectious germ become ill . It suggest mother carrier S. aureus nostril may increase risk develop lactational mastitis , however ; clinical proven . We study relationship S. aureus carrier status breastfeed mother infant risk develop lactational mastitis . Additionally , collect questionnaire data attempt well define factor predispose woman lactation mastitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Staphylococcus Aureus Carrier Status Breastfeeding Mothers Infants Risk Lactation Mastitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lactation mastitis acute inflammation interlobular connective tissue within mammary gland breastfeed woman . It relatively common condition cause pain worry , lead restriction activity increase risk early wean breastfeed . Staphylococcus aureus infectious agent commonly implicate lactation mastitis . It well establish anterior naris primary reservoir S. aureus human approximately 20 % healthy individual `` persistent carrier '' organism . Carriage Staphylococcus aureus identify significant risk factor development infection include surgical wound infection . It suggest maternal infant nasal carriage S. aureus may associate increase risk breast infection lactation . We propose prospectively study relationship S. aureus carrier status 500 healthy breastfeed dyads rate subsequent development lactational mastitis . Carrier status mother infant determine two nasal swabbing perform early post-partum period . The swabs analyzed traditional culture Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification analysis . Mastitis rate determine via serial follow-up telephone interview first two month post-partum .</detailed_description>
