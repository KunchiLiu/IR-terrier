	<detailed_description>1 . SPECIFIC AIMS : The goal study conduct phase II placebo control randomized trial metformin last 12 month prevention memory decline 80 person amnestic MCI order collect preliminary data efficacy , safety , feasibility . - Our primary aim compare change total recall Selective Reminding Test change modify Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-COG ) metformin placebo intent treat basis.. - Our secondary aim compare relative glucose uptake ( rCMRgl ) posterior cingulate-precuneus measured brain [ 18 ] F-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . - Our exploratory aim compare plasma amyloid beta ( Aβ ) 42 metformin placebo . 2 . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : - Burden Alzheimer 's disease . The prevalence Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) expect quadruple year 2047 . There know curative preventive measure AD . Current treatment option AD address symptom , treatment available focus delay actual disease process . One currently accept hypothesis pathogenesis AD main culprit accumulation Aβ brain , process become target treatment preventive measure . Amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) use describe transitional state normal cognitive function AD , thus target intervention . Persons MCI progress AD rate nearly 10 % 15 % per year . The criterion commonly use definition AD dementia MCI . We propose use criterion slight modification recruit person pilot trail AD prevention person amnestic MCI . - Hyperinsulinemia , diabetes , risk AD . Peripheral hyperinsulinemia ( high insulin level ) potentially impair Aβ clearance , study proposing use metformin , insulin lower agent , prevent AD improve Aβ clearance brain . The insulin resistance syndrome hyperinsulinemia common individual without diabetes , relate increase risk cardiovascular cerebrovascular outcome . Hyperinsulinemia predict development diabetes ; therefore , diabetes consider consequence marker past hyperinsulinemia . According NHANES III data , 40 % population age 60 year problem glucose intolerance diabetes , related insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia . We find risk AD individual without diabetes increase increase level fast insulin , high insulin level relate faster decline memory score . The high prevalence hyperinsulinemia diabetes ( 49 % elderly Northern Manhattan ) biological plausibility risk factor cognitive decline AD attract increase attention . In application target hyperinsulinemia , important risk factor AD identify elderly population Northern Manhattan . The risk AD attributable hyperinsulinemia diabetes Northern Manhattan 39 % , high Hispanics African-Americans , high prevalence diabetes insulin resistance , comprise majority sample - Choice metformin treatment agent : . The Diabetes prevention program ( DPP ) trial metformin vs. lifestyle intervention ( diet exercise ) v . Placebo prevention onset diabetes 3,234 individual without diabetes baseline . It find metformin lifestyle intervention successful prevent diabetes vs. placebo 3 year follow-up reduce insulin level . Serious adverse event metformin include hospitalization hypoglycemia similar placebo . More recently , another agent lower insulin level , rosiglitazone , test similar fashion prevention diabetes find effective , test AD give insulin decrease property . However , rosiglitazone 's safety profile good metformin- cause , edema heart failure ( 21 ) , widely use clinical practice person without diabetes , metformin . 3 . METHODS . PARTICIPANTS : In general participant person meet criterion Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment , treat diabetes , overweight obese ( BMI &gt; 25 Kg/m2 ) . - Inclusion criterion : - Memory complaint express participant recognize informant . The memory complaint must represent change previous function base information provide subject informant . - Age range : 55 year 90 year . The main rationale inclusion criterion follow standard set ADCS - Sex distribution : men woman . - Languages : fluent English Spanish . - MMSE equal 20 . The rationale cutoff population Washington Heights heterogeneous educational cultural background . Persons low educational attainment may score 20 without dementia . - Subjects must fulfill criterion amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) accord criterion develop population Northern Manhattan one co-investigators study Jennifer Manly . The diagnosis mild cognitive impairment reach consensus Drs . Luchsinger Dr. Manly base information neuropsychological battery , presence memory complaint , clinical dementia rating . This standard procedure use Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project ( WHICAP ) diagnosis amnestic MCI . Guidelines diagnosis MCI : Subjects must score predetermined cut-off score logical memory II delay paragraph recall sub-test Wechsler Memory Scale Revised ( WMS-R ) selective remind test ( SRT ) . For logical memory II delay paragraph recall cutoff : 1. less equal 8 16 year education . 2. less equal 4 8-15 year education ; 3. less equal 2 0-7 year education . For SRT subject must score predetermined cut-off score . The cutoff SRT calculate individual base age , gender , education level . For example , 75-year old African American woman 6 year education , SRT total recall score 25 yield T-score 42 , normal range , AA woman age master 's degree ( 18 year school ) , T-score 34 impaired range . This woman would classify MCI meet criterion function . - Global CDR score must 0.5 screening . The memory box score must 0.5 1.0 , two box score memory rat high 1.0 box score rat great 1.0 . - *Subjects without known history diabetes diabetes never treat medication . If diabetes diagnose screen history diabetes treat last 12 month exclude HbA1c &gt; 6.5 . In addition , diagnosis diabetes make HbA1c 6.5 % ( American Diabetes Association , January 2010 ) . The reason study include person diabetes medication treat diabetes ( sulfonylurea , insulin ) INCREASE insulin level . This would interfere study , base premise lower insulin level metformin decrease risk memory impairment . The ADA recommend target &lt; 7 HbA1c diabetes treatment . Thus , person HbA1c &lt; 7 new diagnosis diabetes require pharmacologic treatment . We propose include study person new previous diagnosis diabetes , never treat drug , HbA1c 6.9 % less . The rationale cutoff want diminish chance someone enrol study new diabetes old diabetes without pharmacologic treatment require treatment 12 month study . We provide participant result test include HbA1c . The participant physicians discretion start diabetes treatment . If happen record information continue follow participant randomize . These participant ( diagnose diabetes start treatment outside study ) would still consider Intent-to-treat analysis . All inclusion exclusion criterion still apply participant include body mass index . - Overweight obese National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) criterion ( BMI equal 25 kg/ m2 ) ( 33 ) . The main rationale use criterion predict insulin resistance general population need use criterion generalizable standard phase III trial . Measurement insulin diagnosis insulin resistance standard clinical practice , absolute definition constitute insulin resistance . Using BMI criterion surrogate insulin resistance acceptable alternative use research clinical practice . Glucose intolerance necessarily proxy insulin resistance may sign insulin deficiency . Thus , use glucose intolerance criterion enter study . - No contraindication metformin treatment . - Hachinski score less equal 4 . - Hamilton score less equal 12 17 item scale . - General cognition functional performance diagnosis dementia make time screen base DSM-IV criterion . - Vision hearing must sufficient compliance test procedure . - Exclusion criterion : - Individuals dementia - MMSE &lt; 20 - At time telephone contact screening , may conduct Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) potential participant agree . This procedure currently follow Studies Columbia University screen person unlikely memory impairment ( recruit person mild cognitive impairment ) . A Score &gt; 34 Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) 41 consider normal cognition . Persons score invited participate . - Subjects neurologic disease associate neurologic deficit . - Subjects current psychiatric diagnosis depression , bipolar disorder schizophrenia . - Normal individual without cognitive complaint . - Subjects uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure 95 mmHg . - Subjects history active cancer cancer within last five year , exception squamous basal cell carcinoma skin . - Subjects reason may complete study judge study physician . - Subjects known history diabetes treat medication . - Subjects new old diagnosis diabetes , never treat , hemoglobin A1c 6.5 - Contraindications metformin : Contraindications metformin use include creatinine &gt; 1.5 , liver disease history elevate transaminase , congestive heart failure , alcohol abuse . We also exclude subject history intolerance metformin . - Use cholinesterase inhibitor . The rationale exclusion ADCS show beneficial effect donepezil 12 month ( 16 ) could confound study . We survey data use cholinesterase inhibitor , believe use uncommon person AMCI , particularly recruit community . - Exclusion criterion brain imaging study : - Presence diabetes , even HbA1c less equal 6.5 . The reason FDG PET uptake affect glucose level . - Inability lie reason . - Presence metallic implant . - Claustrophobia . - Any contraindication MRI FDG PET determine staff hatch center ( MRI ) Kreitchman center ( PET ) . A safety screen form MRI research center attach . SCREENING AND RECRUITMENT : We advertise within medical center , use free newsletter Community Washington height , use pay print medium , use free pay internet medium , use radio . If contact participation , screen exclusion criterion . If person feel comfortable cognitive test phone , administer Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) . We access WebCis , internet base clinical information system Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) , use ascertain exclusion criterion . If person meet criteria AMCI , invite participate study randomize metformin placebo within one month . The source participant be:1 ) The Associates Internal Medicine ( AIM ) practice Columbia University ; 2 ) Memory Disorders Clinic ( MDC ) AIM ; 3 ) The Community Washington Heights . We expect 50 % participant Hispanic , 30 % Black , 20 % Non-Hispanic White , 70 % woman , 30 % men . RANDOMIZATION . We propose use random permute block method randomization ensure balance group give small sample size . If participant include study APOE-ε4 genotyping use information block randomization . SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS . We collect medical history concomitant medication data every visit . Participants examine 3 month interval . Imaging study conduct baseline 12 month visit . METFORMIN AND PLACEBO . Metformin Dosing Schedule side effect : Metformin match placebo provide Merck-Lipha France . The medication placebo manage dispense Research Pharmacy Columbia University Medical Center . Persons first give metformin 500 mg day baseline . At day-7 dose increase 500 mg twice day . At day 14 , dose increase 500 mg three time day . At day 21 , dose recommended 1000 mg twice day . At day 28 , call patient via telephone ascertain tolerate dose 1000 mg twice day , usual maximum dose recommend clinical practice . If participant report tolerate dose metformin , ask remain low tolerate dose . The common side effect metformin gastrointestinal intolerance . At baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month visit end study measure renal function , liver function , complete blood count monitor side effect . This information make available data safety monitor board study . NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL BATTERY . All measure available English Spanish . The neuropsychological battery include 2 co-primary outcome , Buschke Selective Reminding test , modify ADAS-Cog .
