	<brief_summary>This pilot study seek evaluate feasibility measure proximal effect concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) expression potential therapeutic target molecule Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . Specifically , study proposes evaluate extent CRT induce differential expression component along two critical , potentially interdependent , molecular pathway : arachidonic acid epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway .</brief_summary>
