	<detailed_description>This outpatient , randomize , parallel-group , double-blind , multicenter , 8-week study follow treatment arm : 1. larazotide acetate ( AT-1001 ) 4 mg ( three time day ) 2. larazotide acetate ( AT-1001 ) 8 mg ( three time day ) 3. placebo ( three time day ) Subjects require baseline/screening biopsy follow-up biopsy Day 56 . Subjects require adhere gluten free diet duration study . Primary Outcome : * To assess efficacy larazotide acetate ( AT-1001 ) versus placebo induce remission subject active Celiac Disease . Improvement define change ( Villous Height Crypt Depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio ) , measure duodenal-jejunal biopsy . Secondary Outcome : *To ass safety tolerability larazotide acetate ( AT-1001 ) subject active Celiac Disease . Estimated Enrollment 106 subject Estimated Study Start Date : February 2008 Estimated Study Completion Date : December 2009</detailed_description>
