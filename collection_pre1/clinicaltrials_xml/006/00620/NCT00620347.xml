	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy primary treatment option patient small cell lung cancer , lead 5-year survival 20 % limited disease ( LD ) , less 5 % extensive disease ( ED ) . Although initial tumor response rate chemotherapy high ( 96 % LD 65 % ED ) , SCLC relapse approximately 4 month ED 12 month LD adn despite administration second-line chemotherapy , overall median survival patient limited extensive disease approximately 18 9 month , respectively . In set second-line therapy , response rate chemotherapy range 15 25 % , median survival range 4-6 month . Second-line therapeutic option include cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine ( CAV ) give every 3 week topotecan , similar response rate , time progression survival two treatment arm ( topotecan 24 % , 13 24.7 week ; CAV 18 % , 12 22 week , respectively ) . However , treatment however substantial toxicity , 9 % patient trial withdraw toxicity reason . Treatment-associated mortality high 4.7 % ( possibly definitely relate ) , many patient require transfusion support . Thus , treatment acceptable activity second-line , active less toxic treatment require patient population.Tyrosine kinase inhibitor become promising new class anti-cancer agent owe importance target tumor proliferation , survival ( apoptosis ) , angiogenesis , motility , metastasis Among important receptor tyrosine kinase regulate tumor angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2/Flk-1/KDR ) , PDGFR , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor family . These receptor belong split-kinase domain superfamily , also include Kit , receptor stem cell factor ( SCF ) . Kit frequently express multiple hematologic non-hematologic malignancy . It also activate autocrine fashion coexpression SCF , case SCLC , approximately 70 % tumor cell line coexpress Kit SCF level . Inhibition Kit use small molecule inhibitor result growth inhibition multiple SCLC cell line . Sunitinib , novel small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor direct antitumor well antiangiogenic activity via target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , KIT , FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase , show anti-tumor activity mouse xenograft model SCLC . Therefore , investigator conduct phase II trial evaluate efficacy toxicity Sunitinib patient recurrent SCLC.-Single arm -Sunitinib ( 50mg/day , 4weeks , 2 week ) Repeat every 6 weeksTreatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient ' refusal</detailed_description>
