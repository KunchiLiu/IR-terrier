	<detailed_description>Concurrent Chemoradiation therapy widely accept standard treatment locally advance unresectable stage III NSCLC . When compare result radiation therapy alone CALGB 8433 trial ( i.e. , 9.7 month ) , median survival time almost double last 2 decade , rarely exceed 18 month chemoradiation therapy randomize trial . On hand , significant portion patient endure side effect grade 3/4 esophagitis also pneumonitis , result treatment-related death case . There great need develop effective less toxic treatment strategy . Recently , molecular-targeted therapy use EGFR-TKIs bring new enthusiasm NSCLC therapy . The investigator observe median survival time 20.1 month chemo-naïve never-smoker Korean patient adenocarcinoma lung . The benefit EGFR-TKI also demonstrate never-smokers participated phase III trial carboplatin/paclitaxel without Erlotinib ( TRIBUTE ) . Despite lack benefit overall patient population , Erlotinib confer survival benefit never smoke cigarette , In analysis , 105 patient identify never smoker median survival 10 month , similar entire study population , treat carboplatin/paclitaxel plus placebo . However , patient subpopulation treat Erlotinib chemotherapy regimen , median survival increase 22.5 month ( P = 0.01 ) . Furthermore , EGFR mutation associate significantly high response rate longer survival compare without EGFR mutation . More importantly , median survival time patient EGFR mutation-positive tumor exceed 20 month majority study . These result provocative give fact patient stage IIIb amenable chemoradiation therapy stage IV NSCLC patient include study many study , majority patient heavily pre-treated multiple chemotherapy regimen . The investigator postulate case properly select , EGFR-TKI would significantly improve overall survival patient locally advance unresectable stage III NSCLC . The investigator therefore propose randomized phase II trial evaluate efficacy toxicity EGFR-TKI Erlotinib select group NSCLC patient EGFR mutation-positive stage III tumor . The use induction chemotherapy feasible effective . It also logistically beneficial decreasing micrometastases radiation-related toxicity decrease tumor burden definite locoregional concurrent therapy . Previously investigator conduct several phase II study IP chemotherapy advance NSCLC demonstrate IP chemotherapy promising activity readily manageable toxicity profile . Given encouraging activity IP chemotherapy advance stage setting , investigator postulate investigation stage III setting might lead prolongation survival time . In addition cisplatin , Irinotecan demonstrate act radiation sensitizer preclinical clinical setting . Therefore , use concurrent radiotherapy might lead radiation sensitization improve locoregional control .</detailed_description>
