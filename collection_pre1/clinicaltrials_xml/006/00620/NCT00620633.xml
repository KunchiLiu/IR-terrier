	<criteria>Prior receive treatment , patient may undergo diagnostic and/or test WT1 malignancy determine disease likely respond treatment WT1 specific T cell . Alternatively , blood sample may require research test ascertain WT1specific Tcells contain cell could react patient . These patient sign separate pretreatment consent . If determine patient qualify might benefit infusion WT1 CTLs , he/she go sign standard treatment consent MSKCC IRB # 07055 enrol treat trial , eligibility criterion meet . Patients eligible trial include patient pathologically confirm diagnosis leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , follow allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant , relapse leukemia demonstrate morphologically peripheral blood smear bone marrow aspirate , recurrent persistent minimal residual disease demonstrate least 2 sequential testing separate least 1 week demonstrate molecular evidence residual leukemia MDS FISH cytogenetics . In addition , patient receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant treatment leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome expect risk relapse post transplant &gt; 30 % eligible donorderived WT1 peptide specific T cell generate prior time transplant immediate use post transplant time patient find minimal residual disease relapse . This include patient AML ALL either refractory primary induction therapy stage later first relapse AML ALL , CML secondary chronic phase , accelerated disease treatment blast crisis RAEB RAEBT stag MDS respond recur follow induction therapy . Furthermore , patient 's leukemic MDS blast document express WT1 protein detectable immunohistopathologic analysis diagnostic paraffin embed marrow biopsy , obtain diagnosis relapse type know commonly express WT1 high frequency . Expression WT1 assess modification technique Dupont Soslow ( 36 ) grade accord adaptation German Immunoreactive Score ( IRS ) product subscores intensity immunoreactivity ( 03+ ) distribution immunoreactivity ( 04+ ) . For study , leukemic blast IRS score 412 consider positive . A pathologically confirm diagnosis leukemia MDS . Patients already receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant either document relapse leukemia MDS recurrent persistent minimal residual disease document least 2 sequential testing , separate 1 week , demonstrate molecular evidence leukemia MDS FISH , cytogenetics fluorescent immunocytometry . Patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant treatment leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome expect risk relapse exceed 30 % eligible donorderived WT1 peptide sensitize T cell generate prior time transplant immediate use post transplant time patient find minimal residual disease relapse . This include patient : ALL , AML MDS refractory primary induction therapy ALL AML stage later 1° relapse CML 2° great chronic phase chemotherapy CML persistent accelerate phase blast crisis High risk MDS ( RAEB RAEB+ ) fail respond recur follow induction chemotherapy The patient ' leukemia MDS blast must express WT1 protein detectable immunohistopathologic analysis , ; adequate sample available testing , , must form leukemia ( ALL , AMLs M5 ) MDS ( 2° MDS , RAEB , RAEBT ) know express WT1 high proportion case ( &gt; 60 % ) . For patient develop document relapse leukemia MDS follow transplant , marrow aspirate evaluate proportion blast express WT1 immunohistology FACS whenever possible . The patient 's hematopoietic cell transplant donor must consent 2 volume leukapheresis whole blood donation obtain one phlebotomy , total approximately 250 ml WT1 specific T cell use adoptive transfer generate KPS Lansky score &gt; equal 40 Adequate bone marrow , renal hepatic function time treatment WT1 specific T cell : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; equal 1000/mm3 , without GCSF support . This requirement may waive patient hematologic relapse disease patient yet recover count chemotherapy . Platelets &gt; equal 20,000/mm3 . This requirement may waive patient hematologic relapse disease patient yet recover count chemotherapy . Creatinine &lt; equal 2.0mg/dL ALT , AST &lt; 3.0 total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN There age restriction protocol . Patients relapse also detect CNS may treat protocol . However , intrathecal chemotherapy administer , T cell administer least 24 hour thereafter . Patients active ( grade 24 ) acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) , chronic GVHD overt autoimmune disease ( e.g . hemolytic anemia ) require high dos glucocorticosteroid ( &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) treatment . Patients condition related leukemic relapse ( e.g . venoocclusive disease uncontrolled bacterial , viral invasive fungal infection ) also lifethreatening would preclude evaluation effect T cell infusion . Patients pregnant . Donor Eligibility Donation Blood Lymphocytes Generation DonorDerived WT1Specific T Cells . The eligibility criterion donor blood use generate WT1 peptide sensitize T cell : The donor WT1 specific T. lymphocytes donor provide patient 's hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . These normal donor evaluate evidence prior sensitization EBV EBV serology . If donor seropositive , donor T cell sensitize donor 's WT1 peptide load EBV transform B cell , EBVspecific Tcells also generate seropositive donor generate WT1 specific Tcells , growth persistence post transfer compare WT 1 specific Tcells . Since donor already undergone extensive evaluation his/her health ascertain eligibility donate patient 's HSCT , reevaluation blood donation limit clinical history , physical examination blood test insure new condition , opinion donor 's physician , preclude donor donate blood require . New health condition would exclude transplant donor second blood donation limit , include : New onset HIV infection Other uncontrolled infection could transmit patient blood cell would place patient significant increase risk severe morbidity death . Significant anemia Hgb &lt; equal 10 gm/dl , persist since time original transplant donation . History myocardial infarction stroke since time HSCT donation might increase risk blood donation . A perspective donor inform purpose study , requirement . If he/she consent , donor request provide two blood sampling . An initial donation 25ml blood anticoagulated heparin ACD . This blood use establish B cell line transfuse transformed B95.8 laboratory strain EBV . This EBV+ B cell line/ ( EBVBLCL ) use antigenpresenting cell . When loaded pool WT1 pentadecapeptides , EBVBLCL efficiently sensitize T cell donor WT1 well EBV . Because establishment test EBV transform B cell line suitable use antigenpresenting cell require 45 week vitro culture , important sample obtain early possible patient risk leukemic relapse , since disease relapse frequently occur 26 month post transplant . Accordingly , blood sample obtain donor prior donation hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant whenever possible . A donation either single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis collect standard ACD anticoagulant . If impossible collect leukapheresis donor , unit whole blood accept AICTF ( Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility manufacture clinical grade cell product GMP condition MSKCC ) generation limit number T cell . This blood require isolation T cell sensitize pool WT1 15mers load autologous dendritic cell autologous EBVBLCL , propagate vitro . In addition , require provide autologous feeder cell essential sustain Tcell growth without risk stimulate growth alloreactive Tcells capable induce GVHD . This donation leukapheresis unit blood obtain unrelated HSCT donor least 2 week donation HSCT , soon thereafter possible . In addition provide write consent donation blood purpose generate WT1specific Tcells potential use treatment recurrent leukemia persistent residual disease develop patient donor provide HSCT , donor inform ask provide separate consent follow potential application blood cell donate : The use fraction cell isolated generate immune Tcells specific virus , EpsteinBarr virus ( EBV ) cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , cause lethal infection lymphomas transplant recipient . Such Tcells could use , separate protocol , treat EBVassociated disease ( IRB 95024 ) and/or treat CMV infection ( IRB 05065 ) patient receive donor 's hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant . Consenting application limit number blood donation would require donor , since white cell donate leukapheresis provide enough cell grow immune Tcells WT1 , EBV CMV . The donation immune Tcells specific EBV CMV generate donor use require patient originally intend bank immune cell start maintain cryopreserved GMP condition Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility MSKCC , potential use treatment patient EBV lymphomas cytomegalovirus infection express HLA allele share donor .</criteria>
