	<brief_title>Behavioral Insomnia Therapy For Those With Insomnia Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent debilitate condition reduces quality life , increase health care utilization , markedly impairs social/occupational functioning , enhance suicide risk countless individual worldwide . A substantial proportion MDD patient present comorbid insomnia significantly complicate clinical management . For many patient , insomnia represent longstanding problematic condition predates onset MDD , add suicide risk , dampen response traditional depression treatment , enhance likelihood MDD relapse . Moreover , many patient show remission depressive symptom traditional therapy ( e.g. , antidepressant medication , cognitive therapy ) suffer residual insomnia increase chance eventual relapse . Despite deleterious effect insomnia may MDD patient , surprisingly little research test effective insomnia management strategy among patient group . Some report suggest depression treatment may benefit add hypnotic medication traditional depression therapy , approach limit since sleep improvement achieve hypnotic endure hypnotic discontinuation . Cognitive-Behavioral Insomnia Therapy ( CBT-I ) represent promising alternative treatment MDD since highly effective produce sleep improvement persist well beyond discontinuation acute therapy . Unfortunately CBT-I yet test among MDD patient comorbid insomnia . In current project , conduct randomized clinical trial test efficacy CBT-I use isolation combination antidepressant medication ( escitalopram ) among MDD patient comorbid insomnia . A sample 201 patient MDD comorbid insomnia randomize treatment consist combination antidepressant medication plus CBT-I , antidepressant medication plus placebo behavioral insomnia therapy , CBT-I plus placebo medication . Objective ( polysomnography , actigraph ) subjective ( sleep diary , questionnaire ) sleep measure , well depression quality life measure obtain therapy , 8-week treatment phase , 6-months follow-up . Results trial provide important new information short long-term management highly challenge difficult treat patient insomnia comorbid MDD . Hypothesis I assert combine CBT-I+AD therapy produce significantly great pre-to-post therapy improvement sleep continuity measure 2 mono-therapy condition . The primary outcome hypothesis subjective ( sleep diary ) measure TWT SE . These sleep measure record daily 2-week period baseline , post-treatment , 6-month follow-up . The daily measure average 2-week period . As result , patient three repeat outcomes two sleep measure : one represent average baseline , one average post-treatment , one average 6-months . Sleep diary estimate TWT SE pre post treatment serve primary measure test hypothesis . Our secondary outcome measure include diary estimate total sleep time ( TST ) , well objective measure TWT , SE , &amp; TST take pre-and post-treatment PSG actigraphic monitoring We use 3 ( treatment group ) x 2 ( Baseline vs. post-treatment ) Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) model compare performance treatment condition across primary secondary outcome . Treatment comparison CBT-I + AD vs. 2 treatment make . Alpha 2 primary outcome fix 0.025 ( = 0.05/2 ) . Further analysis adjust pre-treatment stratification variable covariates . The investigator , particular , mindful treatment adherence credibility data collect use measure covariates investigator find differential adherence credibility rate across treatment condition . In addition , investigator explore effect change medication observe change outcome measure consider medication usage data derive MQS106 .</detailed_description>
