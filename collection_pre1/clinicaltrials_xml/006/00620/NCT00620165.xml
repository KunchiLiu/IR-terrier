	<brief_title>Efficacy Levetiracetam Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available pharmacological treatment essential tremor hamper relatively low efficacy intolerable side effect . Recent evidence indicate levetiracetam ( LEV ) may modulate dopaminergic system . In regard LEV show reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesia , tardive dyskinesia myoclonus , relatively well-tolerated elderly . Previous study examine efficacy LEV treatment essential tremor . However , either open label relatively short duration study . A long term study LEV treatment essential tremor therefore warrant . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study , ten subject essential tremor randomly assign receive either LEV maximum dose 3000 milligram ( mg ) per day placebo . Study drug titrate 6 week continue 1500 mg twice daily additional 6 week . Following 4 week washout period subject cross arm continue additional 12 week . Subjects evaluate monthly blind examine neurologist research coordinator . At study visit subject receive neurological examination evaluate use 16-item scale tremor medication side effect . The data derive study drug vs. placebo group compare use Mann-Whitney U Wilcoxon W test .</detailed_description>
