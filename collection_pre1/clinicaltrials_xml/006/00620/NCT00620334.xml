	<brief_summary>Despite development effective medication treatment , asthma remain significant contributor morbidity , mortality , financial hardship patient disease . An estimated 300 million people worldwide asthma , make one common chronic disease world . Asthma account 250,000 death per year worldwide , 1.7 million emergency room visit per year United States . Cost asthma United States estimate $ 12.7 billion dollar per year 1998 , prevalence increase . In 2002 , 13.9 million outpatient asthma visit private physician office hospital outpatient department , 484,000 asthma hospitalization . Children 5-17 year age miss 14.7 million school day , adult miss 11.8 million work day due asthma 2002 . There single diagnostic test symptom defines asthma . Asthma syndrome consist constellation symptom include wheeze , cough , shortness breath , chest tightness . The diagnosis asthma take account history , physical examination finding , objective measure pulmonary function marker inflammation . In many case diagnosis question , allow early recognition appropriate treatment . In case , confound factor make diagnosis challenging time consume physician patient . According National Asthma Education Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 2 , asthma define : `` chronic inflammatory disorder airways many cell cellular element play role , particular , mast cell , eosinophil , T lymphocytes , macrophage , neutrophil , epithelial cell . In susceptible individual , inflammation cause recurrent episode wheeze , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough , particularly night early morning . These episode usually associate widespread variable airflow obstruction often reversible either spontaneously treatment . The inflammation also cause associated increase exist bronchial hyperresponsiveness variety stimulus . '' Airway obstruction reversibility measure pulmonary function test inhalation short act beta agonist . Airway hyperresponsiveness measure methacholine challenge . Estimates asthma prevalence generate use write questionnaires epidemiologic study . , One difficulty reliance questionnaires patient often misinterpret question fail answer question altogether . In study , physician review questionnaire patient order clarify question . The goal study evaluate simplify set question easily implement clinical practice predict presence absence asthma . Hypothesis A simplified questionnaire predict asthma adult . Study Objectives ยง Primary Objective To evaluate predictive value questionnaire design diagnose asthma adult</brief_summary>
