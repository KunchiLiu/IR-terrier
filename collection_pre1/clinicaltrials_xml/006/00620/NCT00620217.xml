	<detailed_description>Aim Study : Achieving therapeutic angiogenesis gene therapy use plasmid cod human VEGF-A165/bFGF inject ischemic myocardium refractory coronary artery disease patient , employ percutaneous catheter-based technique- double-blind placebo control study . A large group patient severe persistent symptom coronary artery disease effectively treat use method available today - sometimes describe `` no-option '' patient . It currently evident promise emerge therapy patient might stimulation neoangiogenesis area ischemic myocardium , generally require use growth factor . Different method different growth factor use experiment test approach . The two agent attract great interest researcher naturally FGF ( fibroblast growth factor ) VEGF ( vascular-endothelial growth factor ) . A number method , animal human experiment , also try deliver agent effectively area interest ensure prolong action target tissue . Basic research reveal potent form angiogenic growth factor basic FGF ( bFGF ) VEGF type A , especially 165 amino-acid form ( VEGF-A 165 ) For reason clinical research therapeutic angiogenesis do use one two growth factor . This knowledge first clinical study use bicistronic VEGF-A 165/bFGF plasmid . Study design : The aim study achieve therapeutic angiogenesis gene therapy use bicistronic plasmid encode human VEGF-A165/bFGF ( pVIF ) inject ischemic myocardium . A percutaneous catheter-based technique ( Myo-Star , Johnson &amp; Johnson® ) use plasmid delivery . The study plan double-blind prospective placebo control trial . The patient population comprise CCS III CCS IV coronary artery disease patient treated standard revascularization method ( `` no-option '' patient ) . In course study shall attempt analyze efficacy therapeutic plasmid-induced angiogenesis term myocardial perfusion increase clinical symptom improvement . The feasibility safety plasmid delivery method also assess . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki , 1964 , later amendment . Patient population : 52 patient randomize two group 2:1 proportion : ph-VEGF-A/FGF ( pVIF ) treatment group ( n=34 ) placebo group ( n=18 ) . The analysis perform intention treat basis . All patient enrol study receive optimal medical treatment judge treat physician . An effort make modify medical therapy study course clear-cut reason . Study course plasmid therapy : A naked plasmid encode human placebo plasmid use study . The plasmid synthesized Department Cell Biology , Cancer Center , Warsaw , Poland team Prof. P. Janik , co-participating study . The VEGF-A165 bFGF cDNA incorporate pSec expression plasmid along CMV promoter zeocin resistance gene amplify E. coli DH5α strain . The plasmid extract accord method describe Y. Isner approve FDA . It also gain certificate Polish Drugs Institute acceptance Ethical Committee Institute Cardiology limit clinical trial use . The plasmid give total dose 0.5 mg , 10 injection 0,2 ml region reversible ischemia . The process inject solution ten point within ischemic zone take 20 40 second minimize muscle disruption . This dosage regimen seem efficacious safe , document work Sylvén et al. , Laham et al . Isner et al . After consent take part trial , eligible patient prepared standard invasive cardiology procedure . Standard angiography ventriculography perform prior plasmid injection therapy . The ischemic area interest identify inclusion SPECT . Cardiac nuclear magnetic resonance ( cNMR ) adenosine also perform assess heart morphology , function perfusion . Next , injection perform accord protocol described . The injection catheter supply catheter supply Johnson &amp; Johnson® ( Myo-Star ) use throughout study . Proper myocardial needle fixation monitor radiographically ECG ( ventricular extrasystole ) . Standard early safety follow-up injection therapy include assessment basic laboratory parameter ( troponin I , CK-MB , RBC , electrolytes ) , vital sign , echographic evaluation ECG . Its purpose diagnose possible post-injection therapy complication , especially left ventricle puncture major bleeding . Follow-up visit perform month 4 month 12 injection therapy . Each visit include full history , physical examination , laboratory assessment , ECG exercise test . Dipyridamole-stress SPECT echocardiographic evaluation perform inclusion month 4 - time expect termination plasmid expression . At week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 injection therapy blood sample obtain assess plasma VEGF-A bFGF level . Primarily , change myocardial perfusion rest dipyridamole-stress SPECT evaluation injection therapy measure efficacy . Changes exercise tolerance also monitor along number efficacy safety parameter .</detailed_description>
