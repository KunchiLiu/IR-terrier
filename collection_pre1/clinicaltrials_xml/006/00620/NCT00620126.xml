	<brief_title>The Home Telemanagement ( UC HAT ) Trial Patients With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) common inflammatory condition bowel result bloody diarrhea , abdominal pain , lack control bowel movement . UC chronic medical condition cause frequent episode symptom ( `` flare '' ) follow symptom-free interval . Although drug available treat symptom , obstacle successful treatment . Because patient need take medication continuously avoid flare , compliance drug difficult . Monitoring symptom UC also challenge , flare sporadic often occur time routine office visit . This result treatment delay . Although drug use treat colitis effective , side effect decrease compliance quality life . Patient 's knowledge disease also poor , affect many aspect care . Telemanagement system telemedicine system design ( 1 ) assist physician monitor patient , ( 2 ) assist physician follow current guideline , ( 3 ) help patient follow self-care plan , ( 4 ) deliver educational fact patient . Telemedicine system use disease similar UC improve outcome . We design telemanagement system specifically patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD HAT ) find IBD HAT easy use , accept patient , improve various aspect patient care include patient knowledge , quality life , bowel symptom . The purpose study determine home telemanagement system patient UC ( UC HAT ) improve clinical outcome compare routine care . Patients UC identify University Maryland IBD program gastroenterology clinic VA Maryland Health Care System , Baltimore . A computer program assign interested patient chance either UC HAT routine care group . Patients UC HAT group ask complete self-testing week home use system . The home-unit consist laptop computer electronic weight scale . After turn computer , patient answer question bowel symptom , medication side effect , compliance medication . The home-unit prompt subject measure weight scale . Subjects receive educational `` tip day '' . The following session , subject answer educational question relate tip . After self-testing complete , result transmit via phone line secure server . The result make available immediately review physician 's web portal . Based response symptom diary , side effect question , medical compliance , body weight , electronic alert action plan generate . An alert sent electronically study coordinator , review information discus finding principal investigator patient 's medical provider . Changes patient management make appropriate . An action plan create patient first visit contains list task patient start immediately self-testing certain criterion meet . Patients still undergo regularly schedule clinical visit prescribe medical provider . Patients assign routine care group undergo schedule follow clinical visit , telephone follow , receive educational fact sheet disease . This consider routine care center . All patient undergo research visit every 3 month one year . Patients complete series questionnaire visit measure patient 's disease activity , quality life , IBD knowledge , medical compliance , parameter . Emergency room visit hospitalization also measure . A blood draw require study visit . We think UC HAT improve monitoring bowel symptom medication side effect improve medical compliance . These improvement result decrease bowel symptom , improve quality life , decrease urgent care visit hospitalization . If UC HAT effective , system could use IBD community improve clinical care use patient limited access health care .</detailed_description>
