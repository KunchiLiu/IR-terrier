Current treatment AN include different form psychotherapy medication , success treatment highly variable among people AN . A well pathophysiologic understand AN needed order develop novel therapeutic strategy prevent treat disorder . Current research target dopamine ( DA ) , neurotransmitter release response pleasurable stimulus , food drug . Animal study find chronic food restriction may alter function DA system reduce DA response food drug stimulus . A good understanding effect disorder eat DA system people AN may provide insight development new improve treatment people AN . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image investigate change DA system people AN weight restoration administration methylphenidate , psychostimulant medication . The study also use PET image compare DA system people AN DA system people healthy . This study involve healthy participant participant AN . Study participation healthy participant include two PET scan one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , , participant prefer , complete one study visit . Study participation participant AN include three PET two MRI scan . The first PET MRI scan perform upon entry hospital inpatient . The remain scan conduct 2 4 week participant accomplish weight restoration . Including preparation , MRI study last 45 minute PET study last 3 hour . For MRI study , participant ask lie back 15 minute MRI scanner . For PET study , participant first inject dose [ 11C ] raclopride , radioactive drug use brain imaging , lie back 30 minute PET scanner . One hour second PET scan healthy participant third PET scan participant AN , participant receive oral dose methylphenidate . During scan , participant also undergo blood pressure monitor electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Once participant longer feel effect methylphenidate vital sign return normal , discharge medical center study participation complete .</detailed_description>
