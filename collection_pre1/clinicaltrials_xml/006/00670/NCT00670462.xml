	<detailed_description>Recent dramatic increase prevalence make obesity number one nutritional problem US . Of particular concern fact , although available treatment effective produce clinically significant weight loss , ability sustain weight loss long term poor . This study base conceptual analysis problem argue great attention two issue related temporal dynamic challenge long-term weight control . These : 1 ) environment continually change supportive weight control 2 ) intervention method effective induce short-term change behavior weight often lose potency time habituation . This study randomize trial obese men woman assign one two study condition , Standard Behavior Treatment ( SBT ) Maintenance-Tailored Treatment ( MTT ) . The MTT adaptation change central theme . A primary technique use convey theme different traditional behavior treatment participant ask deliberately change weight-loss strategy systematically time rather use approach consistently across time . Frequent change serve platform teach large variety weight-control skill thus strengthen study participant ability adapt weight-control strategy change circumstance . Changing weight-control strategy regularly also help reduce extent habituation strategy implement invariantly time diminish salience behavioral cue potency behavioral reinforcer sustain weight-control effort time . Individuals treatment group receive active intervention period 18 month , follow 12 month no-treatment follow-up . The primary hypothesis test MTT produce large mean weight loss 30-month follow-up SBT . Moreover , predict well long-term success MTT group due primarily well weight-loss success beyond 6 month , point people begin regain weight standard therapy .</detailed_description>
