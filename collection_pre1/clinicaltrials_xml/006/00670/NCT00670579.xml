	<brief_summary>Pulmonary infection major cause mortality morbidity cystic fibrosis ( CF ) ; patient frequently take antibiotic often give orally aerosol administer intravenously . In order reduce number venepunctures , totally implanted venous access device ( TIVAD ) Ports use administer antibiotic infusion . The use Port system increase recent year , especially patient require frequent intravenous treatment . Having TIVAD place make venous access quicker also reduce trauma , suffer pain . However , important complication associate TIVADs early ( pneumothorax , arterial puncture , severe bruising ) late ( infection , thromboembolic complication occlusion ) . Although use TIVADs CF increase , little CF-specific literature available epidemiology risk TIVAD complication . Also , literature scarce clinical criterion decide insert TIVAD . Therefore , far clinical decision base mainly experience TIVAD use disease , cancer . With prospective observational study survey large population Italian CF people TIVAD order : collect data current clinical condition CF people TIVAD ; investigate clinical criterion lead decision position TIVAD ; observe possible onset late complication .</brief_summary>
