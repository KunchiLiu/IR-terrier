	<brief_summary>A strongly positive crossmatch long consider absolute contraindication kidney transplantation patient anti-HLA antibody never able receive kidney transplant . Over past decade , significant progress make overcome early antibody-mediated renal allograft injury . Our group perform 200 transplant provide possibility transplant previously untransplantable patient . Despite best effort , transplantation patient still complicate high rate acute humoral rejection . Patients include study demonstrable anti-HLA antibody specific live donor . It hypothesis blockade terminal complement activation time transplant combination current protocol reduce incidence AHR patient anti-donor HLA antibody .</brief_summary>
