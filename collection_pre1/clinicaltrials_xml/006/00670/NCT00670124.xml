	<brief_title>Hypothermia Prevent High Intracranial Pressure Patients With Acute Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute liver failure ( ALF ) associate high mortality . With severe hepatic encephalopathy elevate arterial ammonia concentration ( &lt; 200 micromol/L ) 50 % patient develop high intracranial pressure ( ICP ) risk cerebral incarceration death . The therapeutic option limit treat prevent condition new intervention much sought . As hypothermia use patient cardiac resuscitation could speculate hypothermia reduce cerebral metabolic rate would contribute neuroprotection reduce risk cerebral hypertension patient ALF . We design open , randomize unblinded study order evaluate effect prophylactic hypothermia ICP , cerebral hemodynamics oxidative metabolism . Patients randomized standard medical treatment ( SMT ) SMT hypothermia 33Â° C 72 hour use cool mattress ( Blanketrol II , Cincinnati Sub-Zero ) . All patient receive mechanical ventilation , antibiotic , inotropic support monitor invasive non-invasive equipment accordance local guideline . In Copenhagen monitor cerebral hemodynamics include : Placement intracranial pressure measure catheter ( Camino ( R ) , Integra ) monitoring ICP . Furthermore , microdialysis catheter ( CMA-70 ) place brain cortex use monitoring brain metabolism . Finally , cerebral perfusion monitor measure mean flow velocity use transcranial doppler and/or oxygen saturation blood jugular vein . Ethical consideration : The Helsinki II declaration follow informed consent mandatory enrollment . In patient hypothermia believe suspect harmful study stop primary investigator notify immediately . All adverse effect record publish together full paper .</detailed_description>
