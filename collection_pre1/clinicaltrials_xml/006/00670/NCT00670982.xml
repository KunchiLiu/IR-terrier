	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination With Vinorelbine Trastuzumab HER2-Positive , Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive bevacizumab intravenously every 2 week . They also receive trastuzumab vinorelbine intravenously week . Therefore , treatment alternate receive three drug ( 1st week , third week , fifth week , etc . ) receive trastuzumab vinorelbine ( 2nd week , fourth week , sixth week , etc . ) A treatment cycle last four week . - During treatment cycle physical exam perform participant ask general health specific question problem experience . - X-ray , CT scan , and/or MRI scan perform every 8 week ( every 2 cycle ) order ass effect study treatment participant cancer . These test consider standard care patient receive chemotherapy . - Once week blood count perform least every 4 week , chemistry test measure additional effect study drug disease status check . These test also consider standard care patient receive chemotherapy . - At begin study 4- 8-week time point , additional blood drawn order conduct research blood test measure presence cancer cell blood . - A urine test MUGA scan echocardiogram do every 8 week participant study . - Participants remain research study long study treatment appear work experience unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
