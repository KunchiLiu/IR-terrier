	<brief_summary>Background : -This study use experimental cancer treatment use patient lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) , specially select genetically modify target destroy tumor . Objectives : -To test safety treatment determine cause patient tumor shrink . Eligibility : - Patients great 18 year less equal 66 year age whose cancer spread beyond original site respond standard treatment . - Patients tissue type human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A*0201 . - Patients cancer cell ESO-1 gene . Design : - Workup : Patients scan , x-ray , laboratory test , test need . - Patients leukapheresis collect cell laboratory treatment later reinfusion . For procedure , whole blood collect thorough tube vein , desire cell extract blood , rest blood return patient . - Chemotherapy : Patients low-dose chemotherapy 1 week prepare immune system receive treat lymphocyte . - Cell infusion aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) treatment : Patients receive lymphocytes 30-minute infusion vein . Starting within 24 hour infusion , receive high-dose aldesleukin infusion every 8 hour 5 day ( maximum15 dos ) . - Recovery : Patients rest 1 2 week recover effect chemotherapy aldesleukin . - Tumor biopsy : Patients may ask undergo biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tumor ) treatment look effect treatment immune cell tumor . - Follow-up : After treatment complete , patient return clinic month several month physical examination , review side effect , laboratory test scan . They may undergo leukapheresis visit look effect treatment immune system check viability infused cell . Patients return National Institute Health ( NIH ) clinic year 5 year complete follow-up questionnaire another 10 year . - Retreatment : Patients whose tumor shrink disappear follow treatment recurs may receive one additional treatment , use regimen chemotherapy , lymphocyte infusion IL-2 treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha beta chain T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize NY-ESO-1 ( ESO ) tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency ( &gt; 30 % ) without need perform selection . - In co-cultures human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A2 ) ESO double positive tumor , anti-ESO TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon ( IFN ) -gamma additional secretion cytokine high specificity . - Poxviruses encode tumor antigen , similar replication-defective recombinant canarypox virus ( ALVAC ) ESO-1 vaccine show successfully immunize patient antigen . Objectives : Primary objective : - Determine administration anti-ESO TCR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express ESO antigen . - Determine administration anti-ESO TCR engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) , aldesleukin , ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express ESO antigen . Secondary objective : - Determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : - Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must : - metastatic cancer whose tumor express ESO antigen ; - previously receive non-responder recur standard care metastatic disease , except melanoma patient ; - Patients may : - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 X 10 ( 9 ) cell ) culture presence anti-cluster differentiation 3 ( CD3 ) ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 X 10 ( 8 ) cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-ESO TCR gene . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene transduce PBMC plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) without ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine . Subcutaneous injection ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine administer day 0 approximately 2 hour prior intravenous infusion cell second dose ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine give day 14 ( +/- 2 day ) . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . Cohorts 1 2 : - Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic melanoma renal cell cancer ; cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer . - For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - For stratum , objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-ESO TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) . Cohorts 3 4 : - For patient receive ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine , patient also enter two cohort base histology : cohort 3 patient metastatic melanoma renal cell cancer cohort 4 patient histology patient receive treatment regimen include ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine . - For 2 new stratum , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two new cohort trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - For stratum , objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-ESO TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte , ALVAC ESO-1 vaccine able associate clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
