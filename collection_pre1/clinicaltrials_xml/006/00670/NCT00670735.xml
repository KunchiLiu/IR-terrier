	<brief_summary>The Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network ( HCRN ) establish philanthropic funding conduct multi-institutional research ( clinical trial observational study ) pediatric hydrocephalus . In addition philanthropic funding , HCRN also receive NIH NINDS Challenge Grant support network infrastructure allow conduct network study . The HCRN consist multiple Clinical Centers Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) . The HCRN Core Data Project obtain data neurosurgical hydrocephalus event network Clinical Centers , create database use HCRN investigator . The ongoing maintenance Core Data Project serve two main purpose : 1 ) help investigator understand variability , progression , current treatment practice hydrocephalus child , ultimate goal well guide assess therapeutic intervention provide recommendation patient care , 2 ) provide pilot descriptive data necessary hypothesis generation study design ( i.e . preliminary power analysis , recruitment projection ) study development HCRN . This multi-institutional database maintain throughout lifetime HCRN , may useful track trend pediatric hydrocephalus time . The Core Data Project invaluable resource HCRN help stimulate new research protocol , identify potential need future expansion network incorporate additional patient population , provide descriptive understanding child hydrocephalus care within network .</brief_summary>
