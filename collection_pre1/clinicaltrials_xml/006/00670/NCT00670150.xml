	<brief_title>New Retinoid Agent Combined With Arsenic Trioxide Untreated Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study newly diagnose APL patient : - To evaluate efficacy ( complete molecular response rate ) toxicity NRX 195183 induction therapy - To evaluate efficacy ( molecular response rate ) toxicity NRX 195183 combination arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) consolidation therapy . - To evaluate efficacy ( event free-survival , disease-free survival ) toxicity NRX 195183 maintenance therapy patient APL achieve molecular complete response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Patients must clinical diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) morphology FAB M3 variant confirm RTPCR assay PMLRARα chromosome analysis/FISH showing ( 15:17 ) translocation . A patient may enter prior confirmatory study , patient subsequently find PMLRARα negative remove protocol treatment . Prior Treatment The patient must receive systemic definitive treatment APL , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , retinoids arsenic trioxide . Prior therapy corticosteroid , hydroxyurea leukapheresis exclude patient . Age : Patients must age eighteen ( 18 ) . Other Criteria Patients must follow laboratory value : Bilirubin equal le 1.5 time upper limit normal . Creatinine equal le 1.5 time upper limit normal Pregnancy / Nursing Status Patients enter study nonpregnant nonnursing plan become pregnant treatment . Treatment protocol would expose unborn child significant risk . treatment . Women men reproductive potential agree use effective mean birth control . There extremely high risk fetal malformation pregnancy occur treatment amount retinoid drug even short period . NonAPL , AML patient exclude study . Other serious illness would limit survival 1 year . Psychiatric condition would prevent compliance treatment informed consent . Uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease . This would include history recent acute myocardial infarction , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , active angina . AIDS HIV positive patient , although HIV test require accrual .</criteria>
