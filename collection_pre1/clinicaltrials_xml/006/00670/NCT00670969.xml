	<brief_title>Validation Hand Held Indirect Calorimeter Overweight Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Rationale : With grow number overweight obese Americans , health professional need accurate convenient tool help personalize weight loss program . Portable indirect calorimetry measurement expensive handheld device often limit research setting , make impractical clinical use . Additionally equation use estimate rest metabolic rate may significantly inaccurate overweight patient . Several study conduct determine accuracy handheld device , however none do overweight obese population . If handheld calorimeter accurately measure rest metabolic rate overweight obese patient , test may use improve personalize weight management program . 2 . Key Objectives : To determine group overweight obese volunteer handheld indirect calorimeter accurately measure oxygen consumption determine rest metabolic rate .</detailed_description>
