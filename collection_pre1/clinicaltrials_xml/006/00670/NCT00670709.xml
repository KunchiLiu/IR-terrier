	<brief_summary>The pace basic science research define mechanism selective neuronal degeneration Huntington disease ( HD ) far exceed pace translation information clinically effective treatment disease . One reason bottleneck bench bedside paucity available surrogate marker HD . Identification surrogate marker critical design future clinical trial . Such marker could provide reliable signal early brain dysfunction HD could use biomarker trial agent could prevent onset delay progression disease . Frontal-subcortical network know affected HD contribute cognitive dysfunction characteristic disease . Quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) use assess integrity circuitry ; characteristic QEEG abnormality long know present early stage illness ( Bylsma et al. , 1994 ) . More recent research suggest comprehensive topographic approach QEEG analysis may reveal additional change brain activity ( Bellotti et al. , 2004 ) may indicative subclinical disease ( de Tommaso et al. , 2003 ) . This proposal aim determine whether quantitative EEG technique use identify HD-specific abnormality thus serve surrogate marker disease . The goal pilot project three-fold . First , determine QEEG difference normal control subject mild moderate HD . Second , examine association severity HD QEEG difference detect determine QEEG difference present compare least affected HD subject normal control . Third , examine association QEEG variable interest clinical variable , include age onset symptom , number CAG repeat , severity motor behavioral symptom measure Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale ( UHDRS ) subscores , severity cognitive impairment measure cognitive subscore UHDRS Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We examine three subject group study : mild HD , moderate HD , normal control . Fifteen subject examine group , overall total forty-five subject . HD subject recruit UCLA Huntington Disease Center Excellence follow serial neurologic examination completion portion UHDRS every 6-12 month . Subjects give diagnosis HD base appropriate motor sign confirmatory genetic test know family history HD invite participate . Healthy control subject recruit clinic well spouse unaffected relative patient . In addition , control subject data acquire previous study use matching age . All subject age 21 free medical illness could also affect brain function able give inform consent . Mild HD define Total Functional Capacity [ TFC ] score UHDRS 11-13 , moderate define TFC 7-10 , normal control subject free neurologic psychiatric illness . Subjects free antipsychotic antidepressant medication , benzodiazepine , medication know affect central nervous system function least 10 day prior QEEG examination . All subject undergo QEEG record manner similar employ clinically , use procedure approve protocol UCLA Medical IRB consistent standard clinical EEG procedure promulgate ABRET ( American Board Registered Electroencephalographic Technologists ) . Recording electrode apply scalp use electrode cap ( ElectroCap , Inc. , Eaton OH ) ; electrodes arrayed record electrical activity major brain region use standard extension International 10-20 system ( figure 1 ) . Recording electrode connect isolation amplifier part digital EEG system ( NuAmp System , NeuroScan , Inc. , El Paso , TX ) . Data record real-time computer disk . During record , subject rest quiet room subdue lighting , eyes-closed , maximally alert state ; EEG technologists alert subject whenever drowsiness evident computer monitor . Data display real-time computer monitor recording , adjustable filter amplification facilitate identification EEG pattern well artifact . Data collect use bandpass filter 0.3 70 Hz , digitize rate 250 samples/channel/second . Data record Pz referential montage , NeuroScan software reformat data bipolar montage need cordance calculation . Three EOG lead use ( RIO-A2 , ROC-A2 , LOC-A1 ) lateral , horizontal , oblique eye movement artifact may detect easily . Data quantitative analysis select data record accord standard procedure : EEG review technician first 20-32 second artifact-free data select process obtain absolute relative power four frequency band ( 0.5-4 Hz , 4-8 Hz , 8-12 Hz , 12-20 Hz ) selection confirm second technician ; technician blind clinical status make review selection . Two QEEG measure calculate subject . The first cordance , calculate use algorithm detail elsewhere ( Leuchter et al. , 1999 ) . Cordance base upon normalization absolute relative power value across electrode site frequency band give record . Cordance value strong association cerebral perfusion brain tissue underlie electrode site standard QEEG power measure . The second QEEG measure examine QEEG coherence ( Leuchter et al. , 1992 ; 1994b ) , measure share functional activity brain region . Coherence value range 0 - 1 analogous correlation coefficient , value near 1 signify highly coordinate cerebral activity . Coherence reflect cortical activity , also function deep gray matter structure coordinate cortical activity well white-matter tract connect brain region .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Subjects affect HD risk HD virtue firstdegree relative illness , methamphetamine abuse dependence , well normal control , participate . All subject age 21 . Subjects recruit clinical setting , also selfreferred . Exclusion criterion : Individuals pacemaker , infusion pump , metallic shrapnel exclude MRI assessment . Such implanted metal may attract MRI machine put individual risk . Moreover , individual history brain surgery and/or skull fracture also exclude .</criteria>
