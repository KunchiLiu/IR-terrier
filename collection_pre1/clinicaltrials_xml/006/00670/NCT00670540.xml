	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine different risk factor thromboembolic disease . Different point study 1. different type thromboembolic disease ( distal Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) , proximal DVT , Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) DVT , PE without DVT ) clinical significance ( risk factor prognosis ) ? 2 . Is necessary obtain detailed history thromboembolic disease ? 3 . Do old patient particular risk factor ? 4 . Do preventive treatment modify level risk factor clinical sign thromboembolic disease ? 5 . Do predictive clinical score performance outpatient ? 6 . Can patient potential high level thromboembolic risk ( surgery , pregnancy ) clinical thromboembolic symptom , develop low risk ? 7 . The evolution disease patient negative positive Venous ThromboEmbolism ( VTE ) exploratory test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology Thromboembolism Disease : A Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OPTIMEV study prospective epidemiological multicenter cohort study , include in-and outpatient clinically suspect thromboembolic disease . Deep vein thrombosis diagnose use duplex ultrasound examination , whereas pulmonary embolism investigate lung scan scintigraphy compute helical tomodensitometry and/or duplex ultrasound examination . Initial data medical history , clinical symptom , presence transient chronic risk factor , diagnosis end medical examination , diagnostic test result , treatment ( type duration ) collect physician electronic medical record . Other general medical consideration collect ( particularly cardiovascular disease ) . A phone follow 3 month , 1 , 2 3 year realise Centre Clinical Research Grenoble . All Venous ThromboEmbolism ( VTE ) positive patient ( include superficial vein thrombosis ) contact . For VTE positive negative one select ( site , season ) . Data mortality , development recurrence VTE , treatment prescribe ( type + duration ) , major bleeding , cancer onset , cardiovascular event venous insufficiency ( leg ulcer ) collect . All serious adverse event document reviewed independent critical event committee .</detailed_description>
