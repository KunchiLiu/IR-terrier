	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together paclitaxel radiation therapy see well work treat patient unable tolerate cisplatin stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remove surgery . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving vorinostat together paclitaxel radiation therapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat , Paclitaxel , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients Unable Tolerate Cisplatin With Stage III Non-Small Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) vorinostat administer combination paclitaxel thoracic radiation therapy patient locally advanced NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity vorinostat administer combination paclitaxel thoracic radiation therapy patient locally advanced NSCLC . II . To determine radiological response rate , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , vorinostat administer combination paclitaxel thoracic radiation therapy patient locally advanced NSCLC . III . To describe progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) regiment 3 year follow . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study vorinostat follow phase II study . Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) , 5 day week paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour week . Patients also undergo radiation therapy QD , 5 day week . Treatment repeat every week 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 12 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
