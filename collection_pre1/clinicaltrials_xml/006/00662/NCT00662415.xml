	<brief_summary>Almost everyone traumatic limb amputate experience phantom limb - vivid impression limb still present , also many case , painful . Preliminary data study WRAMC WU # 05-71034 , `` Pilot study ass efficacy mirror-box mental visualization treatment phantom limb pain '' demonstrate 4 week mirror therapy effective treating phantom limb pain ( PLP ) suggest vision key component modulate PLP may explanation efficacy mirror therapy , subject view reflect image intact limb attempt move amputate , phantom , limb . We propose conduct study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify brain region critical mirror effect study relationship visual activation sensation phantom pain . Subjects fMRI scan prior start therapy , 2 week start mirror therapy 4 week mirror therapy . Data gather daily number episode phantom limb pain , average length episode , average intensity pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Brain Changes Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Amputees With Phantom Limb Pain Following Mirror Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective trial use fMRI identify brain region critical generation PLP , examine role mirror therapy visual system de-activation pain pathway , observe change brain may correlate level PLP . Subjects must PLP sustained unilateral low extremity amputation prior enrollment . All subject screen initially neurologist , physiatrist , research coordinator accord inclusion exclusion criterion . A detailed medical history take document , neurologist conduct document physical examination . Subjects meet study inclusion criterion eligible participate research study , continue receive current best practice care . If subject 's pain become severe course study , pain medication available . All subject willing participate study require sign DA 5303-R ( see appendix Voluntary Agreement Affidavit ) prior enrollment study . Once enrol , subject undergo baseline entry evaluation quantify current pain perception use follow evaluation tool : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) short version McGill Pain Questionnaire ( Appendix 1 ) along short questionnaire phantom limb pain frequency duration ( Appendix 5 ) . Subjects also query use current pain medication along dosage weekly basis . Although helpful tool standard care , questionnaire complete subject list medication report subject study research data collection purpose . In order maintain subject confidentiality , subject 's identification code-and subject 's name-will appear questionnaire evaluation form . Subjects identify use cod identifier . For instance , amputee would cod RLE1 , RLE2 , LLE1 , LLE2 , etc . Dr. Jack Tsao , Katie Hughes , Lindsay Hussey-Andersen administer treatment questionnaire . They train research subject appropriate technique use 2 ' X 4 ' mirror perform cognitive test . Unilateral limb amputee subject ask place intact foot front mirror view mirror image intact foot move perform series foot movement amputate , phantom , foot . The sequence foot movement include : abduction great toe , adduction great toe , flexion foot , extension foot , inversion foot , eversion foot , rotation foot , flexion toe , extension toe . These session supervise clinician research coordinator occur 5 time week 4 week ( 20 day ) , session last 15 minute . Prior daily treatment period , subject ask report PLP use VAS McGill form also report number duration PLP previous 24 hour . All subject also participate rehabilitation therapy ( muscle-strengthening exercise , use prosthesis , range motion exercise ) per standard medical care limb amputation . Concurrent use pain medication muscle relaxant permit record research assistant medication diary ( Appendix 2 ) . Scores VAS McGill pain questionnaire use ass subject 's level disability evaluate outcome . Subjects evaluate weekly hospital quantification amount analgesic medication use ( NSAIDs , muscle relaxant , opioids ) , VAS McGill score quantify daily 4 week . The primary outcome change brain area activate week 2 4 compare area activate prior start mirror therapy . Secondary outcome pain relief VAS , responder define subject significant decrease VAS score . All respondent release study final pain evaluation 4 week . A research assistant provide transportation National Institutes Health ( NIH ) fMRI scan take place . Amputee subject ask first use mental visualization move phantom foot report pain level , follow view intact foot move mirror move phantom foot . fMRI scan perform type phantom foot movement determine additional brain region activate visual observation . A fMRI do begin study establish baseline follow-up scan occur 2 4 week daily mirror therapy begin assess change brain activation . Fourteen ( 14 ) control subject recruit ask perform task fMRI scan undergo mirror therapy . Control subject complete McGill pain questionnaire well VAS 3 visit NIH fMRI scan . All subject query current medication use weekly basis . Both amputee control subject part study one month ; undergo 3 fMRI scanning session , intersperse 2 week period . fMRI evaluation take two ( 2 ) hour per session mirror therapy last fifteen ( 15 ) minute , total six ( 6 ) hour fMRI five ( 5 ) hour fifteen ( 15 ) minute mirror therapy .</detailed_description>
