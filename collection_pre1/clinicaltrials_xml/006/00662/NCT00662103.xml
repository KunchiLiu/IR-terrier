	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Aerobic exercise , resistance exercise , flexibility relaxation training may reduce fatigue improve health quality life breast cancer survivor . It yet know type exercise effective inactive old female breast cancer survivor . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study aerobic exercise see well work compare resistance exercise flexibility relaxation train improve health quality life inactive old female breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise , Resistance Exercise , Flexibility Relaxation Training Inactive Older Female Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : - Compare effect aerobic exercise v flexibility relaxation training ( control ) fatigue , aerobic capacity , function , health outcome inactive old female breast cancer survivor . - Compare effect resistance exercise v flexibility relaxation training ( control ) fatigue , muscle strength , functioning , health outcome . Secondary : - Compare relative effect aerobic exercise v resistance exercise fatigue , physical functioning , physical health , mental health . - Determine mediating effect fatigue fitness relationship exercise physical functioning . - Compare individual relative effect aerobic exercise v resistance exercise v flexibility relaxation training ( control ) body composition biomarkers cancer recurrence . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord current use hormone manipulation therapy ( none v tamoxifen v arimidex ) . Patients randomize 1 3 intervention arm . - Arm I ( progressive , aerobic exercise program ) : Patients undergo aerobic exercise training approximately 45 minute ( include warm-up cool-down exercise ) 3 day week 18 month . During first 12 month , patient attend supervise aerobic exercise session 2 day week complete 1 home-based aerobic exercise session use modified exercise program design investigative team . During final 6 month , patient undergo aerobic exercise use at-home program design investigative team . Aerobic exercise training comprise simple step routine use bench various height wear wrist monitor record heart rate . Volume aerobic exercise , determine intensity ( heart rate percentage heart rate reserve tailor patient ) duration ( minute target heart rate range ) , gradually progressively increase first 9 month exercise program . Exercise volume remain moderate level remainder program provide optimal physiologic challenge safe tolerable level . - Arm II ( progressive , resistance exercise program ) : Patients undergo resistance exercise train 3 day week 18 month . During first 12 month , patient attend supervise resistance exercise session 2 day week complete 1 home-based resistance exercise session use modified exercise program design investigative team . During final 6 month , patient undergo resistance exercise use at-home program design investigative team . Resistance exercise training comprises use hand weight barbell ( upper body resistance ) exercise weighted vest ( low body resistance ) . Patients wear weighted vest perform low body strength training ( chair rise , 90-degree squat , toe raise , forward lunge , lateral lunge ) . Patients use hand weight upper body strength training ( upright row , 1-arm row , overhead press , chest press , chest fly , biceps curl , triceps extension ) . Volume strength training , determine intensity ( weight tailor patient ) duration ( number set ) , gradually increase low weight high number repetition weight few repetition first 6 month train period . Exercise volume remain moderate intensity remainder training period provide optimal physiologic challenge safe tolerable level . - Arm III ( flexibility relaxation train [ control ] ) : Patients perform series whole body flexibility ( stretch ) relaxation ( guided imagery , progressive neuromuscular relaxation , focus breathing ) exercise 3 day week 18 month . During first 12 month , patient attend supervised flexibility relaxation exercise session 2 day week complete 1 home-based flexibility relaxation exercise session use modified exercise program design investigative team . During final 6 month , patient undergo flexibility relaxation exercise use at-home program design investigative team . Muscle strength ( measure one-repetition maximum test ) , aerobic capacity ( measure 6-minute walk test ) , functional arm strength ( measure grip dynamometer ) , physical functioning ( measured Physical Performance Battery ) , flexibility ( measure Chair Sit Reach Test Back Scratch Test ) , balance ( measure one-legged stance [ Romberg ] test time stance test ) , lymphedema ( measure circumference upper arm , wrist , finger ) , body composition ( measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , bone mineral density heel ( measure ultrasound ) assess baseline periodically study . Patients also undergo blood urine sample collection cancer recurrence biomarker bone remodel biomarker study . Patients complete questionnaire baseline periodically study assess demographic ( i.e. , age , income ) disease-specific ( i.e. , stage , treatment ) variable , self-report mental physical function , presence chronic medical condition , symptom , fatigue , exercise outside study exercise intervention , dietary intake , psychosocial function .</detailed_description>
