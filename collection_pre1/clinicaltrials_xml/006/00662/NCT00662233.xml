	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well combination chemotherapy work treat patient sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate efficacy , term clinical response , pathologic response , long-term disease-free survival , multidrug chemotherapy regimen patient spindle cell small round cell sarcoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive vincristine IV , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 48 hour day 1 week 0 . Patients continue receive vincristine IV weekly week 1 2 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1 hour ifosfamide IV 1 hour 5 day week 3 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course . - Local control : After complete induction therapy , patient reevaluate local control therapy . Some patient may undergo surgery and/or radiotherapy ( e.g. , brachytherapy , intraoperative radiotherapy , external beam therapy ) . Patients undergo surgery begin consolidation therapy 2 week complete surgery . Some patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 5½ week begin week 12 and/or surgery ( week 15-16 ) . - Consolidation therapy : Patients receive vincristine IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour week 12 18* . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1 hour ifosfamide IV 1 hour 5 day week 15 . Patients reevaluate local control therapy week 21 . NOTE : *Patients undergo radiotherapy receive doxorubicin hydrochloride week 18 week 24 . - Maintenance therapy : Patient receive vincristine IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour week 24 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1 hour ifosfamide IV 1 hour 5 day week 21 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 3 course . In week 36 , patient receive vincristine , doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide OR etoposide ifosfamide . In week 39 patient receive etoposide ifosfamide . After completion treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year .</detailed_description>
