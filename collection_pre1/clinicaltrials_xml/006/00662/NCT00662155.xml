	<brief_summary>The lack scientific attention devote placebo effect phenomenon right probably reflect paucity theoretical position within organize exist data design new research . The propose investigation 1 ) attempt advance descriptive experimental analysis placebo effect , take account classical conditioning effect , 2 ) examines clinical implication partial reinforcement apply treatment insomnia . Subjects primary insomnia treat zolpidem period one month randomize one four group period 12 week : one receive full dose zolpidem nightly basis ( continuous reinforcement ) , one receive full dose zolpidem 14 28 night placebo provide non-drug night ( partial reinforcement ) , one receive full dose zolpidem 14 28 night pill imbibe non-drug night ( intermittent dosing ) , one receive 5 mg dose zolpidem nightly basis ( continuous reinforcement half standard dose ) . Following treatment , subject enter extinction protocol 1 ) continue schedule assign experimental period , 2 ) receive placebo , 3 ) receive neither drug placebo . Sleep daily functioning monitor daily basis via sleep diary duration study . It hypothesize , hold cumulative dose constant , partial schedule reinforcement enable patient well maintain clinical gain compare subject receive either continuous reinforcement half standard dose half frequency use . Relevance : The propose research attempt offer behavioral alternative drug treatment ; attempt acknowledge capitalize behavioral dimension design drug treatment protocol . The value propose research reside capacity provide long term treatment insomnia manner increase durability pharmacotherapy reduce overall amount medication require . If proven effective current application , new approach pharmacotherapy placebo effect likely stimulate new interdisciplinary research treatment variety chronic disease .</brief_summary>
