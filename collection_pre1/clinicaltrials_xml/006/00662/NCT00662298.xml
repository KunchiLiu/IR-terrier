	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether severe asthmatic subject abnormal prednisolone absorption , might affect anti-inflammatory effect prednisolone . The aim study 1. compare effect high dose prednisolone clinical physiological response 2. determine effect long-term oral prednisolone therapy corticosteroid responsiveness prednisolone pharmacokinetics 3. measure effect high dose prednisolone 14 day p38 MAPK activity , GR translocation activation NF-kB 4. validate easy method measure corticosteroid insensitivity use whole blood , spot prednisolone serum level measure adherence prednisolone therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma disease characterize reversible airway obstruction , bronchial hyper-responsiveness , chronic inflammation bronchial mucosal lining . Currently 5 million people ( 6-8 % population ) UK receive treatment asthma . Although patient mild-to-moderate asthma well-controlled inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , 5-10 % asthmatic , disease consider severe symptom control asthma largely unresponsive treatment include systemic corticosteroid ( CS ) . This subset patient great morbidity disproportionate need health care support term use drug , admission hospital use emergency service , time work school . Indeed , severe asthma patient also oral CS addition ICS , patient often describe steroid-dependent since need oral CS addition ICS maintain asthma control . Recent study laboratory show patient severe asthma relative corticosteroid resistance measure responsiveness peripheral blood mononuclear cell alveolar macrophage dexamethasone . In asthma , corticosteroid- resistance ( CSR ) usually define basis change baseline FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume one second ) 14-day course oral prednisolone 40mg/day ; increase le 15 % baseline measurement , demonstrate great 15 % improvement FEV1 follow inhaled β2-agonist , use . Patients show improvement FEV1 30 % consider corticosteroid-sensitive ( CSS ) . The arbitrary cut-off response &lt; 15 % response choose empirically without knowledge distribution responses oral inhaled CS . CSR asthmatic completely resistant effect corticosteroid , stop corticosteroid therapy lead clinical deterioration . It known present whether reduce corticosteroid responsiveness see severe asthma genetically-determined acquire , . Patient CSR define necessarily patient severe asthma . The response patient severe asthma formal trial oral prednisolone lung function inflammatory parameter study detail . For example , know whether absorption oral prednisolone commonly use treat exacerbation asthma normal patient severe asthma . Pharmacokinetic study report normal subject mild-moderate asthma , also CS-resistant asthmatic , 'normal ' pharmacokinetics report latter group . However , need exclude potential course relative CS-resistance severe asthma . Corticosteroids known exert anti-inflammatory effect assess bronchial biopsy , basis beneficial effect asthma . These effect also assess non-invasively use measurement exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) induce sputum eosinophil count . The effect prednisolone trial measurement perform . We previously show value measure IL-8 release whole blood marker inflammatory response . Serum IL-8 TNF-α find high severe asthmatic mild-moderate asthmatic . Therefore , propose study response patient severe asthma oral prednisolone , look drug level anti-inflammatory effect . Anecdotally , find many severe asthmatic patient low prednisolone level , even though compliant medication . Spot level prednisolone ( one-off measurement blood level ) use check compliance . The effect continuous oral therapy prednisolone level suppression inflammation unknown . It previously postulate therapy may lead reduction effectiveness corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agent . Therefore , propose study two group patient severe asthma , ICS alone ICS plus maintenance dose prednisolone range 5-20 mg/day ; control group would moderately-severe asthmatic well control ICS . The patient give fourteen-day course daily 40mg prednisolone ( non enteric-coated tablet ) . Subjects attend Asthma Lab Royal Brompton Hospital screen . They keep peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) symptom diary card 2 week prior two week course prednisolone . Patients already prednisolone maintenance dose increase 40mg . There 5 study visit . On Visits 2 4 , patient fast overnight blood test time 0 hour . They take prednisolone breakfast . Sputum blood sample take , spirometry exhale nitric oxide measure various time interval specify protocol . Visits 3 5 24 hour post 1st last prednisolone dose</detailed_description>
