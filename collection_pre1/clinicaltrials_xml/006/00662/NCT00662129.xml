	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine together bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 6-month progression-free survival rate patient metastatic breast cancer treat paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , gemcitabine hydrochloride , bevacizumab . Secondary - To determine adverse event profile regimen . - To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - To determine confirm response rate , duration response , time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - To determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline every course , completion treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
