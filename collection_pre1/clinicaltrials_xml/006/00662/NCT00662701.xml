	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 invasive strategy Atrial Fibrillation treatment , Endocardial catheter ablation isolation Pulmonary vein versus minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgical epicardial isolation . Both strategy use several year , report successful strategy success rate 60-90 % . However , know technique preferable give patient population term efficacy cure AF , safety , patient discomfort . Therefore , present trial randomize study propose provide insight relative merit technique</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ablation Surgery Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation common cardiac arrhythmia , affect million people around world . It large burden health care resource may even lead short life expectancy . Drug treatment find insufficient sometimes even hazardous pt . Traditionally , one invasive approach available , MAZE 3 procedure mean full open chest cardiac surgery . This invasive approach , limit skilled surgeon , insufficient option treat large pt volume . With discovery AF often initiate maintained electrical instability inside around Pulmonary Veins , catheter ablation widely accept early invasive strategy cure AF . Success rate 60 % 90 % report , depend technique employ type AF ( Resp , chronic versus paroxysmal )</detailed_description>
