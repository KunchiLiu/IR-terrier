	<brief_summary>This propose pilot study conduct detail interview medical , environmental , family histories The second phase study project collect blood specimen obtain DNA . The Blood specimen DNA process Rutgers University Cell DNA Repository ( RUCDR ) store second phase pilot . The purpose rule Familial Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN 1 ) , succinate dehydrogenase complex , subunit D ( SDHD ) , gene inactivation think associate different type carcinoid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Small Intestinal Carcinoid Carcinoma Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There study publish specifically describe medical , environmental , genetic factor carcinoid tumor case carcinoid family member . While rare , incidence four per 100 , 000 , carcinoid represent frequent malignancy affect small intestine . Because nearly half ( 49 % ) case gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor hepatic metastasis diagnosis , identification risk factor associate carcinoid potential increase early diagnosis cure . Carcinoid tumor think occur spontaneously associate inherited genetic abnormality would increase family member 's risk develop carcinoid cancer . There know inherited genetic abnormality associate bronchial carcinoid tumor less 10 % . Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor think associate inherited genetic abnormality . There several small study examine gastrointestinal carcinoid multiple family member . It remain uncertain case carcinoid multiple family member characteristic heritable environmental etiology . Most carcinoid cancer inherit ; however , less 10 % neuroendocrine carcinoid cancer think due change ( call `` mutation '' ) gene inherited parent . There several gene suspect associated carcinoid cancer , two interest study Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type1 ( MEN1 ) , succinate dehydrogenase complex , subunit D ( SDHD ) gene .</detailed_description>
