	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway affect approximately 15 million individual U.S . The rate asthma exacerbation among woman twice men adolescence , large proportion female asthma report worsen asthma symptoms different phase menstrual cycle . Hormonal influence hypothesize account difference . Decreased peak flow rate increase symptom find female premenstrual phase menstrual cycle estrogen progesterone level low . Estrogen progesterone find reduce smooth muscle contractility increase bronchial smooth muscle relaxation . A perimenstrual shift toward Th2 ( allergic ) phenotype characterize decreased interferon-gamma interleukin-10 ratio demonstrate healthy woman use oral contraceptive compare midcycle ; however , effect blunt healthy oral contraceptive pill user , imply hormonal modulation allergic phenotype . Several case report demonstrate therapeutic benefit oral contraceptive decrease asthma exacerbation corticosteroid requirement . Human study demonstrate estrogen decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine generation , neutrophil recruitment , inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase activity , could lead low exhale nitric oxide level . The measurement fractional concentration exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) non-invasive method ass airway inflammation adult child asthma . The hypothesis current study woman use oral contraceptive low FENO level well asthma control assessed Asthma Control TestTM different phase menstrual cycle . This study may identify clinically important change FENO level asthma control menstrual cycle modification effect oral contraceptive pill . This data may lead future study aim identify therapeutic role hormone asthma therapy woman .</brief_summary>
