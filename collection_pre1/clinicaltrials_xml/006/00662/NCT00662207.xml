	<brief_title>Two Devices Reflex Voiding Following Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheters often used individual empty bladder follow spinal cord injury . Reflex void one bladder empty method , relies spontaneous bladder contraction void . These contraction occur normal bladder filling induce suprapubic tap hair pull . Poor void response reflex void occur unwanted contraction urethra bladder contraction and/or unsustained bladder contraction result high residual urine . The focus investigation method reduce high urethral resistance induce sustain bladder contraction . Obj.1 . Measure pelvic floor contractile activity include pelvic floor relaxation response ( urethral anal pressure , EMG bulbocavernosus reflex ) dilation anus digit balloon 60 sec diameter 2 , 3.5 5 cm . Obj . 2 . Measure urodynamic parameter ( urethral anal pressure , EMG , urine flow rate bladder pressure ) compare three somatic method induce bladder contraction , vibration ( 3 mm conduct 100 stroke per second ) suprapubic perineum ( scrotum anus ) location tapping/suprapubic hair pull . Conduct procedure use 80 % cystometric capacity define responder three intervention increase 10 cm H20 pressure great . For nonresponders go objective 4 . Obj . 3 . For responder Ob . 2 , evaluate effect perineum vibration conduct comparison ( 1 ) anal dilation dilation ; ( 2 ) A vibration stroke length 1.5 mm 3 mm ; ( 3 ) A bladder volume 50 % cystometric capacity 80 % . Obj . 4 . Compare urodynamic response spontaneous bladder contraction induce bladder filling ( cystometry ) without anal dilation . Obj . 5 . Conduct human factor assessment . Determine problem use current perineum vibration anal dilation device . Evaluate curve tip insertion device anal dilator would facilitate insertion use plastic bag would improve hygiene . Discuss feature important user-friendly home-use device . Design &amp; Methods : All objective conduct single , urodynamic , test protocol . Fifteen male SCI patient upper-motor-neuron injury enrol . Urodynamic response primary measure . These include urethral anal sphincter pressure anal surface EMG , bladder contraction include peak pressure duration pressure , void response include peak void rate duration void . These measure evaluate anal dilation perineum vibration method alone combination . Anal dilation protocol include random duplicated testing . Vibration method do limit risk autonomic dysreflexia . Analysis variance follow Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc test conduct assess significant difference . Importance Findings : Results study provide evidence anal dilation reduce DSD perineum vibration improve bladder contraction . Thus , study could provide important evidence improve method RV individual SCI . During pilot study , subject counsel conduct RV daily regular bladder management program .</detailed_description>
