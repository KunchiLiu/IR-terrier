	<brief_summary>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive method hold promise treating several psychiatric disorder . Yet effective location parameter treatment need exploration . Also , whether rTMS effective treatment individual DSM-IV diagnosis Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) empirically test . The goal pilot study evaluate whether fMRI guide rTMS effective reducing symptom GAD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Magnetic Transcranial Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study utilize 3-week open-label design evaluate efficacy fMRI guide rTMS treatment GAD . We first use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) gamble task localize anxiety-related brain activation individual participant , use information guide treatment repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . TMS deliver target site frequency 1 Hz 20 minute ( 900 total pulse ) . The intensity TMS set 90 % passive motor threshold participant . The primary efficacy measure include Clinical Global Impression Improvement ( CGI-I ) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS ) . Response treatment define reduction 50 % HARS symptom remission define CGI-I score 1 2 ( `` much improve '' `` much improve '' respectively ) score â‰¤ 8 HARS . Data enter anonymously Excel spreadsheet analyze UCLA Semel Institute Statistical Core . The analysis do intent treat sample use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . A one-sample paired t-test use compare endpoint baseline mean HARS , significance level set p= 0.05 , two-tailed .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject male female outpatient age 18 65 year , inclusive The subject meet DSMIV criterion Generalized Anxiety Disorder determine MINI . Sexually active female patient childbearing potential must practice least one follow method contraception study : intrauterine device ( IUD ) , barrier method combination spermicide , oral/hormonal contraception abstinence . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior receive study drug . Written informed consent must obtain subject prior study participation . The subject good medical health chronic medical condition currently stable . No current abuse alcohol substance . The subject total score 20 SIGHA screening . The subject Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Severity score 4 screening . The subject meet DSMIV criterion Axis I diagnosis ( GAD ) primary diagnosis ( i.e. , schizophrenia , mood disorder , psychosis , anorexia nervosa ) determine MINI . The subject clinically judge investigator risk suicide acutely suicidal objectively measure MINI MSE . The subject clinically judge investigator risk homicide acutely homicidal objectively measure MINI MSE . The subject psychiatric condition would require inpatient , partial psychiatric hospitalization . Seizure disorder . Significant history medical disease ( i.e . cardiovascular , hepatic ( e.g . cirrhosis , hepatitis B C ) renal , gynecological , musculoskeletal , neurological , gastrointestinal , metabolic , hematological , endocrine , cancer metastatic potential progressive neurological disorder ) could impair reliable participation trial necessitate use medication allow protocol . The subject pregnant , plan become pregnant , nursing . If subject becomes pregnant , discontinue immediately follow appropriately . Concomitant therapy another investigational drug , participation investigational drug study within one month prior enter study . Current psychotherapeutic treatment except treatment Specific Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRIs ) medication include : Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , Paroxetine ( Paxil ) , Sertraline ( Zoloft ) , Luvox ( Fluvoxamine ) , Citalopram . Potential subject may remain one SSRI medication provide stable dose least 4 week prior enter study ; dose remain stable throughout remainder study ; determine medication exacerbate anxiety symptom . History poor compliance Investigator 's judgment patient subject whose treatment outpatient would clinically contraindicate The subject attempt suicide one time within past twelve month The subject Structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( SIGHD ) score 38 suggests moderate severe clinical level depressive symptom</criteria>
