	<brief_summary>The radical treatment Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) surgery . However , 10 20 % patient 10 30 % relapse every year surgery . For inoperable case , consider Liver transplantation . But enough organ donor expensive . In case , various treatment modality HCC ( i.e. , transcatheter arterial embolization [ TAE ] percutaneous ethanol injection [ PEI ] , radiofrequency ablation etc . ) become clinically available . In addition , treatment , radiation therapy conduct combined treatment . If difficult , radiation therapy conduct alone . In case , radiation therapy use fractionate stereotactic radiation therapy [ FSRT ] 3D simulation minimize exposure normal tissue . In recent year , Proton therapy new radiation therapy remain energy release reach tumor , deliver effective dose radiation . The purpose trial improve therapeutic effect use proton therapy .</brief_summary>
