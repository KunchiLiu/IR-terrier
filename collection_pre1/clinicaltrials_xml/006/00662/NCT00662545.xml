	<brief_summary>This study evaluate HIV-HBV infected individual evidence HBV replication blood take 48 week HBV active medication tenofovir combination emtricitabine lamivudine . Eligible participant randomize receive 24 week entecavir ( ETV ) 1 mg versus continue standard care antiretroviral therapy . After 24 week , individual entecavir remain HBV viremic standard care receive ETV additional 24 week . The hypothesis intensification entecavir reduce HBV DNA 24 week continue antiretroviral therapy without entecavir .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This randomize , control pilot study open-label entecavir treatment persistent HBV viremia HIV-HBV coinfected individual fail suppress HBV replication 48 week tenofovir contain therapy . Primary Objective : To evaluate mean log reduction HBV DNA entecavir ( ETV ) intensification comparison continue standard therapy tenofovir lamivudine/emtricitabine 24 week therapy Study Population : HIV-HBV co-infected individual detectable HBV DNA 48 week therapy tenofovir lamivudine/emtricitabine whose HIV viremia well control ( &lt; 75 copy time enrollment ) Treatment : Subjects randomize continue standard therapy receive intensification 1 mg daily open label entecavir 24 week duration study . Sample Size : 24 subject enrol . Duration 24 week treatment Primary Endpoint : Mean log10 reduction HBV DNA 24 week standard therapy vs. entecavir intensification .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability willingness provide write informed consent HIV infection , document patient medical record . Acceptable form documentation include positive HIV antibody detectable HIV RNA . Chronic HBV infection , define HBsAg positivity . Both hepatitis B `` e '' antigen ( HBeAg ) positive negative subject eligible . Detectable HBV DNA ( &gt; 160 copies/ml ) 48 week therapy TDF conjunction either 3TC FTC Compensated liver disease , define ChildPughTurcot ( CPT ) Score &lt; 7 time enrollment . Note : If Bilirubin elevate , direct indirect bilirubin level evaluate . If indirect bilirubin elevate , direct bilirubin use CPT score . If BOTH direct indirect bilirubin elevate , total bilirubin use CPT score . Stable antiretroviral therapy change prior 8 week due antiretroviral failure . HIV therapy modification reason virologic failure without change tenofovir ( TDF ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) moiety antiretroviral therapy permit . HIV therapy must include TDF conjunction 3TC FTC , least one antiHIV agent . HIV RNA &lt; 75 copies/ml within 8 week study enrollment . Estimated creatinine clearance CockcroftGault ≥ 50 ml/min Serum alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) ≤50 ng/ml within 8 week study entry , elevate &gt; 50 ng/ml , image study demonstrate evidence hepatic tumor within 8 week enrollment . Female study volunteer must participate conception process ( e.g. , active attempt become pregnant ) . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female study volunteer must use follow form contraception receive studyspecific medication ( ) 30 day stop medication . One follow method MUST use appropriately : Condoms1 ( male female ) without spermicidal agent Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide intrauterine device ( IUD ) Hormonalbased method 1 . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV transmission . Note : Subjects concomitant Hepatitis C infection permit enroll . Allergy sensitivity study drug Pregnancy , breastfeed unwillingness/inability adhere contraceptive method duration study Prisoners subject incarcerate . Evidence malignancy would make subject , opinion investigator , unsuitable study . This include systemic antineoplastic immunomodulatory treatment radiation within 24 week prior study entry expectation treatment need time study . Receipt systemic corticosteroid within 90 day prior study entry ( medication may increase HBV replication ) . Investigational antiHIV agent allow casebycase basis approval protocol team . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Any active medical , psychiatric social circumstance opinion investigator put subject potential risk study participation make adherence study protocol unlikely . Receipt follow drug antiHBV activity within 90 day prior study entry anticipate receipt course study include : adefovir ( ADV ) , telbivudine , alpha interferon , penciclovir ( Denavir ) ( except give &lt; 4 week ) , famciclovir ( Famvir ) , diaminopurine dioxolane ( DAPD ) , clevudine ( LFMAU ) , thymosin alpha 1 , ganciclovir ( treatment limit &lt; 7 day acceptable ) ( Cytovene ) , Ldeoxythymidine , Ldeoxythymidine compound investigational agent antiHBV activity . Receipt nephrotoxic drug ( e.g. , aminoglycosides , amphotericin B , vancomycin , cidofovir [ Vistide ] , foscarnet [ Foscavir ] , cisplatin , intravenous pentamidine [ Pentam ] , oral tacrolimus [ Prograf ] , cyclosporine [ Sandimmune ] ) competitor renal excretion , probenecid ( Benemid ) , within 8 week prior study entry expect use agent course study . ( Topical tacrolimus allow . )</criteria>
