	<brief_summary>Well-documented health benefit may achieve prophylactic screen cardiovascular disease . The advantage few premature death reduction number hospital admission amputation . Furthermore , hospital benefit derive reduction pressure surgery intensive care capacity vascular surgery department . It therefore seem extremely relevant offer joint screen abdominal aortic aneurysm , peripheral arterial disease hypertension , even benefit cost measure currently know . Consequently , primary objective study establish effect cost-efficiency joint circulation screen programme 40,000 men age 65-74 year randomise , clinically control study . The project manager train six nurse measure ABI perform ultrasound scan aorta . The nurse form three team equip portable Doppler , blood pressure cuff portable ultrasound scanner . Each team operate hospital Region . Civil registration number ( Danish : CPR ) , name address information supply Clinical Epidemiological Department ( CED ) , also perform randomisation group approx . 1,000 avoid long period data extraction invitation . Half randomised subject invite participate circulation examination focus PAD , AAA hypertension , half control Men positive finding inform proper preventive action take . Annual control offer , AAA exceed 5.5 cm diameter offer operation . The primary efficiency variable death , cardiovascular death AAA-death . The secondary efficiency variable hospital service relate cardiovascular condition cost service accordance current DRG rate . The entire population , control well screen group , monitor period 10 year . Information concern death , include date death , obtain Civil Registration System , information visit outpatient clinic hospital admission cause cardiovascular condition include amputation obtain National Patient Registry . From Danish Causes Death Registry information cause death collect . The information classify regard cause ; AAA cardiovascular . The cardiovascular intervention identify vascular surgery database ( Karbasen ) . Major follow-up perform 3 , 5 10 year . A steer data validation group form include project manager representative Clinical Epidemiology Department . Furthermore , vascular surgeon two affect department region participate . Total mortality , cardiovascular AAA-related mortality initial cardiovascular hospital service compare two group use Cox proportional hazards-regression analysis facilitate description risk ratio . The cost-efficiency calculation adjust quality life .</brief_summary>
