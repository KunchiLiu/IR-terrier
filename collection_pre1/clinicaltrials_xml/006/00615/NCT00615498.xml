	<brief_summary>Current research show obesity greatly increase risk develop asthma . Although two condition clearly relate , expert fully understand link . Some researcher believe hormone release fat cell ( adipokines ) play role . Others believe excess weight press lung trigger hyperreactive response airway typical asthma . The goal Asthma-Bariatric Surgery Study determine weight loss affect lung function various biological parameter . Bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery refers various surgical procedure perform treat obesity . Specifically , study design answer follow question : - Does bariatric surgery help patient control asthma ? - How much asthma control achieve weight loss ? - How weight loss influence lung function ? Participants observational research study ask complete study visit enrollment , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month . Questionnaires , pulmonary function test , blood sample require time point . This research study observational ; cover cost ( provide ) bariatric surgery . Optional genetic bronchoscopy substudies include well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design explain unexpected effect obesity NO bioavailability airways asthmatic : Specifically , obesity induces systemic oxidative stress part increase production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) adipose tissue , parallel ( consequence ) , increase systemic level tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-Î± ) 8-isoprostanes . Furthermore , create imbalance regulation protective anti-oxidant thiol/disulfide pair glutathione/glutathione disulfide . We hypothesize asthmatic , lung target-organ obesity-related systemic oxidative stress . This manifest increased oxidation airway NO nitrate reactive nitrogen specie ( RNS ) include peroxynitrate nitrotyrosine , thereby reduce NO bioavailability exhale NO level . NO many key physiological property include bronchodilation , anti-tumoral/bactericidal activity , anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative activity . Thus , reduce NO bioavailability obese asthmatic could favor increased bronchoconstriction impair lung 's ability respond oxidative inflammatory challenge . Therefore , hypothesize : 1 ) obesity cause redox stress airway , turn decrease bioavailability NO shunting RNS , 2 ) weight loss decrease systemic oxidative stress thereby increase NO bioavailability due decrease oxidation RNS , 3 ) decrease systemic oxidative stress , weight loss reduce bronchial hyper-reactivity .</detailed_description>
