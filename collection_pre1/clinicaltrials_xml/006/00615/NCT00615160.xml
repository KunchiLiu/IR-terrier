	<brief_title>PTK/ZK Disseminated Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , open-label , parallel-group phase II study evaluate efficacy safety PTK-ZK treatment patient metastatic malignant melanoma qualify surgical resection : - progressive locoregionary disease control surgical measure - distant metastasis brain metastasis eligible surgical resection radiotherapy All patient treat PTK-ZK 1250mg administer orally day treatment cycle 28 day . In case unacceptable toxicity dose reduced 1000 mg 750 mg daily . Patients Arm B additionally receive intravenous DTIC 850mg/m² day 1 cycle . After informed consent give patient biopsy metastasis take first intake study medication end cycle 2 specify marker angiogenesis MVD ( Micro vessel density ) .</detailed_description>
