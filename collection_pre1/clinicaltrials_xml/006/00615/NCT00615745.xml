	<brief_summary>A single tablet regimen ( STR ) efavirenz , emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( tenofovir DF ) first complete HAART offer one tablet day . The individual component HAART regimen demonstrate efficacy safety HIV treatment-naive patient offer simplification turn may increase adherence improve clinical outcome . This study aim evaluate effectiveness ( efficacy , safety tolerability ) STR simplification strategy patient HAART achieve viral suppression real world clinical setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ONCE - Only Nocturnal Combination Evaluation Antiretroviral-Experienced HIV 1 Infected Subjects Switching Atripla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study evaluate pure virological response rate antiretroviral-experienced HIV infect subject initiate therapy Atripla . Subjects switch Atripla already establish individual component efavirenz , emtricitabine , tenofovir DF . Within Chelsea Westminster hospital approximately 540 subject identify currently receive individual component Atripla would eventually switch Atripla . The Royal Sussex County Hospital include ensure recruitment timeline meet . A minimum 150 subject switch within first 6 month allow initial 24 week data subject available approximately 12 month post launch .</detailed_description>

Undetectable plasma HIV 1 RNA ( less 50 copies/mL ) Screening great equal 12 week prior Screening . Greater equal 18 year old . Adequate renal function : Estimated creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min accord Cockcroft Gault formula Hepatic transaminase ( AST ALT ) less equal 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL Adequate hematologic function ( absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mm3 ; platelet great equal 25,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin great equal 8.0 g/dL Serum amylase less equal 1.5 time ULN ( subject serum amylase great 1.5 time ULN remain eligible serum lipase less equal 1.5 time ULN ) Negative serum pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential i.e. , surgically sterile least two year postmenopausal ) Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must willing use two method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 12 week last dose study drug manner risk pregnancy minimize . Subjects may choose two ( barrier highly effective method ) birth control method list : Hormonal birth control drug , Male female condom without spermicidal gel , Diaphragm cervical cap without spermicidal gel , Intrauterine device Female subject utilize hormone contraceptive one birth control method must use method least three month prior study dose . Female subject postmenopausal less two year require FSH great equal 40 mIU/mL . If FSH le 40 mIU/mL , subject must agree use highly effective method birth control ( describe ) participate study . Male subject sexually active must willing use effective barrier contraception ( e.g. , condom spermicide ) heterosexual intercourse screen completion study continue 12 week last dose study drug . Life expectancy great equal 1 year . The ability understand sign write informed consent form , must obtain prior initiation study procedure . Known hypersensitivity toxicity emtricitabine ( FTC ) , tenofovir DF ( TDF ) Truvada Known hypersensitivity toxicity Sustiva Have history resistance study agent time screen ( document presence resistance mutation ( ) define IASUSA 2007 Guidelines A new AIDSdefining condition diagnose within 30 day prior Baseline visit . Pregnant/lactating breastfeed female Severe hepatic impairment ( great 5 time upper limit normal define laboratory transaminase ) deem clinically significant investigator . Any currently know clinical laboratory parameter GSI Grade 4 . However asymptomatic grade 4 abnormality permit discretion investigator deem clinically appropriate ( exclude AEs laboratory parameter mention elsewhere inclusion/exclusion criterion ) . Abnormalities deem insignificant investigator must discuss sponsor prior enrollment . Receiving ongoing therapy prohibit medication . Administration medication must discontinue least 30 day prior Baseline visit duration study period . Active , serious infection ( HIV infection ) require parenteral antibiotic therapy within 30 day prior Screening visit . Current acute illness infection ( e.g. , opportunistic ) include active AIDS defining condition within previous six month . Hepatitis B coinfection Hepatitis C coinfection Malignancy cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) basal cell carcinoma . Subjects biopsyconfirmed cutaneous KS eligible , must receive systemic therapy KS 30 day Baseline visit anticipate require systemic therapy study . Prior history renal bone disease deem significant investigator . Subjects currently take part clinical trial use investigational product , exception study treatment study stop 1 month . Evidence alcohol and/or drug substance abuse judgment investigator would likely result patient unreliable fulfilling condition protocol . History psychological illness condition judgment investigator might interfere patient 's ability understand requirement study . Any clinical condition prior therapy , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study unable comply dose requirement cause patient unable complete study protocol .</criteria>
