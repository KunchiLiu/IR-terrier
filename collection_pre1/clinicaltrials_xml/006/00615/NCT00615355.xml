	<brief_title>Epidermal Cell Transplantation Vitiligo Skin With Without Narrow-band Ultraviolet B ( UVB ) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Surgical intervention vitiligo widely use additional UV exposure often recommend successful transplantation . However , little known additional efficacy ( narrow-band ) UVB due miss comparative study . Aim study : To perform prospective , control , randomize , intra-individual comparative study vitiligo lesion treat epidermal cell transplantation use ReCell method without additional narrow-band UVB treatment . Study design : Two week transplantation epidermal cell , one randomly choose half transplanted patch additionally treat narrow-band UVB therapy whereas half leave untreated . For control purpose , 2 additional patch ( two halfs one patch ) select treat either laser dermabrasion narrow-band UVB narrow-band UVB treatment alone . Grafting ReCell method : A superficial skin shave excision 2 x 2 cm obtain pigment skin ( UVA irradiation 4 week excision ) use Silver knife . A cell suspension obtain use ReCell transplantation kit , accord instruction manufacture . The vitiligo skin dermabraded Erbium : Yag laser local anaesthesia . Thereafter cell suspension spray dermabraded skin area fix special wound dressing . Narrow-band UVB treatment : The initial UVB dose 50 % minimal erythema dose , test next vitiligo lesion treat . Treatment perform 2 time week target UVB device ( Dualight , TheraLight ) . Dose increment 30 mJ/cm2 treatment dose induces slight erythema longer 24 hour . If dose reach , dose reduce last well tolerate dose increment follow . Narrow-band UVB treatment perform least 3 month 24 treatment . Evaluation treatment success : The grade pigmentation lesion evaluate clinically , photograph laser scan microscope every 3 week first 3 month study later every 3 month within first year . The clinical rating perform follow : 0 = repigmentation ; 1 = 1-25 % repigmentation ; 2 = 26 50 % repigmentation ; 3 = 51 75 % repigmentation ; 4 = 76 100 % repigmentation . The evaluation photograph laser scan microscopy picture perform blinded physician engage treatment phase study .</detailed_description>
