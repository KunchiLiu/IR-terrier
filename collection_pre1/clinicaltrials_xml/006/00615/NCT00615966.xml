	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Safety Diannexin Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia-reperfusion injury , occur blood supply organ , part organ , cut subsequently restore , important clinical problem organ transplant setting . Diannexin , recombinant form endogenous human Annexin V protein , development therapeutic agent design prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury follow organ transplantation . Pharmacology study indicate Diannexin protective effect various ischemia-reperfusion injury organ transplantation model . Diannexin bind phosphatidylserine cell surface , believe underlie ability attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury . In completed Phase 1 trial , Diannexin judge safe well tolerate healthy adult subject . The present study design determine safety tolerability single escalating dos Diannexin kidney transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
