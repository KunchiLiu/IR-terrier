	<brief_title>Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography Acute Chest Pain Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , encompass unstable angina ( UA ) ST elevation non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI non-STEMI ) , lead cause death United States . In addition , account significant number hospital admission ( 300,000 per year STEMI , &gt; 1,000,000 per year non-ST elevation ACS ) . Differentiation patient ACS chest pain due cause , well risk stratification within ACS group , critically important . In Emergency Department ( ED ) , ECG initially use distinguish patient STEMI non-STEMI ACS . Subsequent workup non-STEMI patient aim rapidly distinguish require admission possible intervention intensive medical therapy , safely discharge . However , frequent inability determine whether symptom relate ACS initial ED visit , evaluation often need , result estimate 5,000,000 admission per year . Currently , variety modality use process risk stratification , rest myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) often assume central role . This modality overall sensitivity 80 % excellent negative predictive value ( 95-97 % ) . Resting MPI therefore enables clinicians safely triage low risk patient delay stress test discharge . However , test , technique limitation , include increase incidence equivocal finding obese patient , low sensitivity patient without ongoing symptom , unsuitability patient previous myocardial damage . Perhaps importantly , alternative diagnosis aortic dissection pulmonary embolism evaluate myocardial perfusion imaging . If coronary Computed Tomographic angiography ( CTA ) could show robust technique clinical setting , could become powerful tool triage patient ACS . Computed Tomography ( CT ) chest currently consider gold standard evaluation two common serious alternative chest pain diagnose - aortic dissection pulmonary embolism . A single , rapid comprehensive imaging study could reliably diagnose exclude coronary artery disease , aortic dissection , pulmonary embolism would allow quicker appropriate triage acutely ill population . However , keep principle evidence-based medicine , comprehensive gate chest CT angiography recommend preference exist technique , systematic comparative study perform . In study , result CTA compare rest MPI , part standard ED evaluation chest pain institution . In addition , majority patient subsequently undergo stress MPI . It therefore anticipate stress MPI result also compare CTA finding .</detailed_description>
