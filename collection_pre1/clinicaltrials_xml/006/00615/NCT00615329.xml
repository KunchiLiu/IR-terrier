	<brief_summary>Bone soft tissue sarcomas currently classify base upon light microscopy supplement immunohistochemistry , within many tumor histologic type , considerable heterogeneity exist microscopic appearance also biologic behavior prognosis . Progress direct treatment tumor , particularly sarcoma , await characterization gene profile tumor . Orthopedic oncology researcher Huntsman Cancer Institute University Utah establish tumor bank purpose . The long term objective work include : 1. create tumor specific gene profile improve diagnostic accuracy 2. perform gene set validation diagnostic predictive power 3. define discriminate gene list implicate pathogenesis The tissue procure protocol SUNY Upstate Medical University limit excess soft tissue bone tumor tissue patient otherwise undergo clinically indicate procedure diagnosis treatment care local principal investigator ( PI ) forward central investigator , R. Lor Randall , MD Huntsman Cancer Institute use characterization gene profile tumor .</brief_summary>
