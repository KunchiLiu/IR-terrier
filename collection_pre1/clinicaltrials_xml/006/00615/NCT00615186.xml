	<detailed_description>In case surgery possibility , tumor removal usually indicate first step therapy glioblastoma . The goal surgery include removal much tumor mass possible preparation tumor bed adjuvant therapy . Except death arise adverse surgical event ( 1-2 % surgery ) , tumor removal enhance survival time . Unfortunately , without additional therapy , GBM recur near original tumor site within several month . Addition radiotherapy surgery part treatment regimen enhances survival patient compare surgery alone . The use benefit adjuvant chemotherapy GBM controversial . Some study suggest enhancement survival use agent carmustine ( BCNU ) cisplatin , generally 10-20 % patient population show response ( Stewart 2002 ) . The blood-brain barrier present major obstacle traditional us chemotherapy GBM , , therefore , clinical trial focus delivery agent directly brain/tumor mass via catheter pressure-driven infusion . At present , two pharmacologic therapy approve treatment GBM , Gliadel® Temodar® . Implantation BCNU-impregnated wafer ( Gliadel Wafer , Guilford Pharmaceuticals , approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 1996 ) surgery radiotherapy first pharmacologic-chemotherapeutic therapy GBM . It show modest enhancement overall survival ( 11.6 vs. 13.9 month ) add regimen surgery radiotherapy ( Westphal et al . 2006 ) . In patient population , agent demonstrate typical side effect associate antineoplastic chemotherapy , , therefore , often contraindicate . Nevertheless , despite FDA approval availability Gliadel nearly decade , utility remain controversial routinely use daily clinical practice . In 2005 , FDA approve use temozolomide ( Temodar ® , Schering-Plough ) give concurrently subsequent radiotherapy treatment newly diagnose GBM . In multicenter Phase III trial 573 GBM patient , radiation alone give median survival rate 12.1 month ; addition temozolomide lead median survival 14.6 month ( Stupp et al . NEJM 2005 ) . More importantly , 2-year survival rate increase 10 % initial radiation alone 27 % combine chemo- radiotherapy . This regimen consider standard care patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . Ongoing clinical trial explore alternative temozolomide administration schedule combination regimen novel chemotherapy target anti-tumor agent assess efficacy temozolomide alone various chemotherapeutic combination underway ( Herrlinger et al . 2006 , Mirimanoff et al . 2006 , Stupp et al . 2006 , Hau et . al . 2007 ) . The current study investigate whether addition Neuradiab surgery , radiation adjuvant chemotherapy ( temozolomide ) improve survival patient glioblastoma whether drug regimen safe . Earlier trial demonstrate patient-specific dosimetry yield best combination safety efficacy employ current trial . The anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody bind tenascin glycoprotein associate residual neuroblastoma cell , cause associate radioactive iodine fix close proximity tumor deliver cytocidal local radiotherapy . In way , anticipate residual tumor cell , represent primary reason treatment failure use conventional therapy , destroy , thus prolong patient survival . The surgery , radiotherapy , adjuvant chemotherapy administer patient control arm represent appropriate therapy disorder . In addition , tumor sample analyze methyl guanine methyl transferase ( MGMT ) activity see whether previously observe report correlation outcome observe ( Hegi et . al . 2005 ) .</detailed_description>
