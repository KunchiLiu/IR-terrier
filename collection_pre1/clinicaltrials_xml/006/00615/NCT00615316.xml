	<brief_title>Guaraná Radiation Related Fatigue Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate favourable effect Guaraná memory cognition human After approval Institutional Review Board , include consent patient histological diagnosis early stage Breast Cancer adjuvant radiation therapy indicate . We exclude patient previous history Radiation Therapy , anemia clinical depression . We also exclude patient unable grant inform consent medical contraindindications use Guaraná ( psycho stimulant effect ) uncontrolled hypertension , previous history cardiac arrhythmia insomnia . The radiation therapy patient underwent mastectomy consist 28 fraction 180cGy . This study double-blind randomized design crossover experimental arm . After get informed consent , randomized patient begin radiation treatment ( Phase I ) either 75 mg Guaraná extract daily ( Group A ) Placebo ( Group B ) . Randomization centralize pharmacist . Halfway radiation treatment ( Phase II ) , switch patient placebo guaraná vice versa . The protocol end last session radiation treatment ( Phase III ) . In three phase new assessment fatigue depressive symptom undertaken , ie : immediately first radiation treatment ( phase I ) ; switch ( phase II ) right start last radiation treatment ( phase III ) . At three assessment point , patient complete Chalder Fatigue Scale,4 MD Anderson Brief Fatigue Inventory ( available http : //www.mdanderson.org/topics/fatigue/ ) available Portuguese , Beck Inventory Depression Scale II also validate Portuguese . We conduct statistical analysis data Numerical Control Software Solution ( www.ncss.com ) . We employ repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) test compare test score within patient group ANOVA test compare test 's score two group ( similar phase study ) .</detailed_description>
