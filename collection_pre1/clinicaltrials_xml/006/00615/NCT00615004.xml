	<brief_summary>A direct comparison result surgery somatostatin analogue ( SSA ) cardiovascular complication acromegaly never perform . Our objective investigate whether first-line surgery SSA different outcome cardiomyopathy 12 month . The design study retrospective , comparative , non randomize , ethical problem . Setting University Hospital . All patient treat SSA [ either octreotide-LAR ( 10-40 mg/q28d ) , lanreotide ( 30-120 mg/q28d ) ; dosages up-titrated control GH IGF-I level ] operate transsphenoidal approach . For purpose study control patient include . Measurements Primary outcome measure change leave ventricular mass index ( LVMi ) , diastolic [ early atrial mitral flow velocity ( E/A ) ] systolic perform-ance [ LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ] . Secondary outcome measure reduction total/HDL-cholesterol ratio , cardiovascular ( CV ) risk parameter , improvement glucose profile pituitary function , indirect cause CV improvement . Expected result : SSA surgery group similar result term improvement cardiomyopathy . However , recent data suggest SSA reduce directly heart rate cardiomyocytes performance : clinical implication evidence suggest SSA improve cardiovascular outcome surgery . Moreover , surgery , replacement therapy already stabilise new onset , never consider far set .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We review file consecutive patient active acromegaly come Units Endocrinology Neurosurgery `` Federico II '' University Naples Jan 1st 1997 December 31st 2006 , primarily treat either surgery depot SSA , i.e . lanreotide ( LAN ) slow-release octreotide ( LAR ) , available follow-up least 12 month . Due study design , non randomize study . However , routine procedure generally consider first-line treatment SSA 6-12 month , unless tumor clearly non invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) and/or patient present surgical anesthesiological risk . Cure criterion consider accord Giustina et al . Acromegaly consider controlled mean fasting GH level ≤2.5 μg/liter presence normal IGF-I level sex age . Nadir GH oral glucose load ( oGTT ) ≤1 μg/liter also option evaluate disease control accord 2000 Consensus Statement . However , oGTT generally routinely perform patient receive SSA , since GH-induced glucose suppression likely mediate endogenous somatostatin tone . To avoid ascertainment bias , disease control surgery SSA base fast GH IGF-I level . The diagnosis acromegaly define previously report , high serum GH level 6 hr time course , suppressible &lt; 1 µg/l oGTT high plasma IGF-I level age [ express value upper limit normal range ( ULN ) ] . For purpose study patient control acromegaly include provide period follow-up long enough investigate change cardiomyopathy parameter . Study protocol : As routine procedure , diagnosis patient undergo complete metabolic endocrine screening . After overnight fasting , serum IGF-I level assay twice single sample time 0 GH profile ; GH level calculate mean value least 5 ( 8 ) sample draw every 30 min period three-six hour average value consider statistical analysis ; fast total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , glucose insulin level also measure . The total/HDL-cholesterol ratio , index cardiovascular risk , calculate .</detailed_description>
