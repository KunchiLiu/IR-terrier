	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease disease contribute significant morbidity mortality million Americans yearly . Very little known pathophysiology atherosclerosis peripheral artery disease . We plan collect peripheral artery muscle tissue patient undergo amputation end stage peripheral arterial occlusive disease . By extract RNA artery tissue compare RNA expression normal artery , hope well understanding pathophysiology atherosclerosis set . We aim prove hypothesis novel gene expression pattern discover successful extraction RNA plaques human peripheral artery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients schedule undergo low extremity amputation consent extraction plaque carotid artery arterial tissue amputate limb . The surgeon perform amputation , harvest team collect arterial tissue amputate limb . These sample immerse RNALater solution preserve integrity RNA . Tissues store -80oC RNALater RNA later extract use standardize protocol . The RNA examine quality use Agilent bioanalyzer , process Affymetrix U133A chip gene expression data . The data analyze MATLAB software package .</detailed_description>
