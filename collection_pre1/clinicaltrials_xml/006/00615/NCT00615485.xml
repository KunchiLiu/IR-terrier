	<brief_summary>Specific subgroup child survive treatment childhood malignancy show develop relative osteopenia follow chemotherapy felt risk develop osteoporosis later life due inability reach peak bone mass childhood . Based upon early study department , investigator report conclusive evidence approximately half survivor pediatric solid malignancy risk problem . However , proportion patient population show osteopenia/osteoporosis low similar cross-sectional study solid tumor osteosarcoma . The main difference report osteosarcoma study duration follow-up , short . Longer follow-up may prove large proportion patient affect . The purpose perform longitudinal follow-up study bone mineral density use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) adult survivor solid pediatric tumor previously study subject original cross-sectional study . The primary hypothesis proportion pediatric solid cancer survivor significantly low bone mineral density ( BMD ) compare establish age group control increase additional time elapse since original study despite fact patient young would normally expect osteopenia/osteoporosis age .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : The 38 patient SUNY Upstate Medical Center Pediatric Oncology Longterm Survivor Clinic subject original Georg Fund support study comprise patient population locatable willing participate . Patients must less 40 year age participate . Exclusion criterion : Patients receive interval treatment Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL ) receive subsequent cranial irradiation total body irradiation ( group already know high risk osteoporosis ) exclude . These would occur interval since original study , also exclusion criterion study . In addition , patient receive interval nonautologous bone marrow transplant exclude , patient may graft versus host disease ( also know associate osteopenia ) .</criteria>
