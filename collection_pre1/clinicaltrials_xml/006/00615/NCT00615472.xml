	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease common progressive degenerative disease affect 3 % patient age 65 . Given age frailty , patient frequently require surgical procedure general anesthesia . However , surgery , patient Parkinson 's disease longer hospital stay great chance return independent living compare age-matched control ( Berman MF , unpublished data ) . In part , due high rate post-operative delirium , incidence 60 % population one study . There anecdotal evidence neurologist specialize movement disorder suggest also significant deterioration parkinsonian motor symptom cognition lasting month year follow surgery anesthesia . The basis deterioration unknown . We hypothesize problem cause particular medication use inhaled anesthesia surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Versus Inhalational Anesthesia Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We compare group term postoperative delirium , cognitive motor function change . Patients randomize inhaled anesthetic receive standard anesthetic mix : inhale anesthetic intravenous agent rapid induction anesthesia , narcotic postoperative pain relief , muscle relaxation . Patients randomize IV anesthesia receive continuous infusion propofol remifentanil ( ultrashort act narcotic ) instead inhalation anesthetic maintenance phase anesthetic . Other component anesthetic `` inhaled anesthetic '' group . We hypothesize : 1 . Patients Parkinson 's disease less postoperative delirium less prolonged cognitive motor change total intravenous anesthesia follow inhaled anesthesia . 2 . Apolipoprotein E4 ( Apo E4 ) allele associate postoperative cognitive dysfunction Parkinsonian patient To test hypothesis : 1 . Randomize patient Parkinson 's disease surgery implantation current generator subthalamic stimulator receive either total intravenous anesthetic inhale anesthetic . 2 . Compare two group patient incidence postoperative delirium degree postoperative cognitive motor dysfunction . 3 . Test association ( Apo E4 ) allele postoperative cognitive change . A buccal sampling cheek cell sample method employ obtain DNA genotyping Apo E allele . During procedure , maintenance anesthesia differ two group : Group 1 Inhaled anesthesia : Patients maintain oxygen isoflurane 0 4 % , titrate need maintain standard blood pressure ( standard practice ) . Group 2 Intravenous anesthesia : Patients ventilate 50 % oxygen air . Patients receive continuous propofol infusion 0.05 mg/kgmin 0.15 mg/kgmin titrate neededÍ¾ remifentanil ( ultrashort act narcotic ) 0.1 ug/kgmin 0.5 ug/kgmin . These titrate need maintain standard blood pressure . Both infusion turn end procedure . Testing Motor Cognitive Status . Patients participate study give mental status examination , test Parkinsonian motor symptom , test cognitive function preoperative period implantation subthalamic electrode implantation current generator . Subsets test perform several time postoperatively ( 1 month 4 month ) Implantation Electrode ( Stage I sedation anesthesia ) Full test do preoperative period . Patients generally keep hospital overnight discharge follow day . Mental status rechecked MMSE recovery room postoperatively . Patients contact telephone mental status assess telephone use use two well know examination ( Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) Centers Disease Control Prevention Health-Related Quality-of-Life 14Item Measure ( CDC HRQOL14 ) ) series question investigate well patient able perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) . These test give two time point , surgery one month surgery . We look change quality life may correlate neuropsychometric test performance .</detailed_description>
