	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Acute Rheumatic Fever ( ARF ) , chronic rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) neuropsychiatric/ movement disorder relate group A beta haemolytic streptococcal infection ( GABAS ) remain major public health problem South Africa . RHD may require repeated hospital admission , invasive surgery often result premature death . In Africa ARF mortality 2-3 % . 1 Likewise , neuropsychiatric disorder Sydenham 's Chorea ( SC ) result GABAS result school difficulty , frequent absenteeism , behaviour problem obsessive compulsive disorder may progress Tourette Syndrome ( personal experience ) . Patients may suffer disable neurologic psychiatric symptom many year initial episode ARF ( personal experience ) . The morbidity condition demand enormous resource state term medical surgical treatment believe result preventable stress suffer patient family . Whilst ideal goal primary prevention measure secondary prevention attain use monthly prophylactic penilente . In case ARF occur , intervention desirable , prevent complication . At Rheumatic Fever Clinic ( RFC ) Red Cross Hospital patient establish RHD old case Sydenham 's Chorea ( SC ) see . There 2-4 new case ARF see per month . ARF remain notifiable disease appear new case often notify . ( personal communication PAWC health official ) SC major manifestation ARF follow 1992 update modify Jones Criteria , sufficient alone make diagnosis ARF.2 The duration SC range week 2 year . Recurrences occur one third patients.3 Current treatment SC purely symptomatic whether resolve 6 week 2 year dependent innate healing mechanism within individual . SC postulate mediate auto- antibody mis-recognise neuronal cell component . These complex result inflammatory response basal ganglion resultant clinical picture SC . 3 We hypothesise , use intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) decrease number circulate antibody thereby decrease symptom severity shorten course illness . Prophylactic penicillin must continue prevent re-exposure formation antibody . AIM We aim determine whether treatment SC IVIG expedite recovery thus cut morbidity frequent follow . METHOD Our aim collect minimum 20 patient acute SC , diagnose accord revise Jones Criteria ARF absence indicator cause chorea . ( Table 1 ) The study would run 4 year minimum number recruit . Patients would identify chorea would rat mild , moderate severe sign chorea carefully document per attach format . ( A ) Special investigation would perform ( Table 2 ) . Patients IgA deficiency would exclude study . Informed consent would obtain . Patients would randomly select receive IVIG standard treatment . Each patient allocate code number . Patients admit neurology bed , usually occur acute management moderate severe SC . Patients notify . Standard pharmacological treatment ( Table 3 ) haloperidol sodium valproate administer , addition trial group receive IVIG . All patient commence penicillin prophylaxis . On day two ( administration IVIG complete ) investigator ( KW ) blind observer ( WM ) examine patient sign chorea per addendum A . The patient remain hospitalise cope activity daily live . Patients review one month , 3 month , 6 month 1 year time necessary , consistent current management . They assess blind observer ( WM ) chief investigator ( KW ) . Follow RFC . IMI penicillin give discharge , 1.2 million unit 30 KG 600,000 unit weight less 30 KG NB . Improvement symptoms IVIG alone , expect third week post treatment.5 The aim therapy shorten overall course illness prevent complication . SAMPLE SIZE We aim get minimum twenty case , 10 receive IVIG 10 standard treatment . ANALYSIS Aim get minimum 20 new case . Statistical analysis outcome measure undertake . ETHICS / CONSENT In recent year IVIG use successfully safely number auto-immune condition . 4 Informed consent obtain . Parent consent form available English , Afrikaans Xhosa COSTING Salaries . No contract staff casual assistant would employ . Already salaried staff would look patient . Patients SC usually admit hospital treatment administer except administration IVIG , assessment serum gamma-globulins brain spectroscopy scan ( single photon emission compute tomographic scanning ) . The department Nuclear Medicine consent perform scan . It show hemichorea hypermetabolism occur contralateral basal ganglion disappear resolution symptoms.8 Nursing duty would remain current admission SC . The additional nursing duty would monitor IV infusion . The registrar senior house officer assist management patient . As state earlier ARF public health problem South Africa . It important therefore health professional aware preventative curative treatment available treatment SC .
