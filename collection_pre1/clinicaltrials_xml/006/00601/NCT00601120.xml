	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effect procedure call radiofrequency ablation kidney tumor patient undergo antiangiogenic treatment . Antiangiogenic treatment type treatment inhibits formation new blood vessel require tumor growth . Radiofrequency ablation ( RF ablation ) involve insert needle tumor tissue administer heat tumor tissue sufficient kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RF Ablation Treatment Metastatic Lesions Patients Undergoing Antiangiogenic Therapy Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants undergo RF ablation procedure one tumor go away undergoing antiangiogenic treatment . The RF ablation procedure perform operating room one Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center hospital perform general anesthesia . - Blood also draw 2-4 week procedure , time teh procedure 2-4 week procedure . - The RF ablation procedure perform specified time relation participant antiangiogenic treatment ( sorafenib sunitinib ) : ) If participant take sorafenib , ask stop take 2-5 day prior RF ablation procedure ; b ) participant take sunitinib , ask stop take 4-7 day prior RF ablation procedure . - Participants MRI CT scan tumor ( ) within 2-4 week procedure 2-4 week procedure . The MRI CT scan tumor ( ) determine much blood flow go . - At time RF ablation , participant biopsy tumor ( ) receive CT scan area ablation perform procedure ass bleed . They also monitor 4 hour RF ablation procedure .</detailed_description>
