	<brief_summary>This three-year research project . The major aim study : ( 1 ) compare functional recovery oncologic result patient advance rectal cancer treat either traditional open laparoscopic method randomize prospective clinical trial ; ( 2 ) investigate presence tumor cell peripheral blood patient undergo either laparoscopic open surgery ; ( 3 ) search clinicopathologic feature advance rectal cancer CCRT ; ( 4 ) conduct translational research regard difference gene expression prognostic significance advance rectal cancer chemoradiation therapy micro-array analysis method ; ( 5 ) exploration potential stem cell colorectal cancer use CD-133 cell surface marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Comparing Oncological Results Functional Recovery Between Laparoscopic Open Method Treatment Advanced Rectal Cancer After Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy ( CCRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With progress medical technology , minimally invasive laparoscopic colorectal surgery currently enthusiastically perform medical center world . Because preoperative CCRT induce fibrosis pelvic tissue , colorectal surgeon hesistant apply laparoscopic approach resection irradiate rectal cancer . However , base preliminary experience ( Liang et al . Dis Colon Rectum Sep,2005 ) , find rectal cancer resect laparoscopic approach , advantage include good visualization anatomical structure pair hypogastric nerve , presacral fascia , lateral ligament , seminal vesicle middle hemorrhoidal artery , compare traditional open method . Moreover , conduction laparoscopic double-stapling technique pull-through procedure jeopardize CCRT even pelvis narrow male patient . That , current surgical technique , feel laparoscopic procedure feasible safe inrradiated rectal cancer . Because application technique resection rectal cancer CCRT report academic importance , mandatory u conduct randomized prospective study . Remarkably , objective surgical stress-related factor include CD4+/CD8+ , ESR , CRP , IL-6 ( serum intra-peritoneal surgical wound ) , presence cancer cell either laparoscopic open group patient analyze compare . Moreover , translational research regard expression gene prognostic significance chemoradiation therapy scarce . In project , plan explore influence chemo radiation therapy gene expression microarray analysis accord reproducible experience develop colleague research gastric cancer ( JCO 2005 ; 23:7286-95 ) . Initially , focus expression difference commonly mention gene relate chemosensitivity colorectal cancer , include mismatch repair gene , thymidylate synthetase , Dipyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , extend screen whole genome . Moreover , recent report indicate cell population harbor CD-133 ther potential colorectal cancer stem cell . In project , also explore change histopathology CD-133 cellular population advance rectal cancer CCRT . Because randomized prospective clinical trial , uneasy accrue enough patient . According statistical estimation , least 558 patient recruit randomize either traditional open group laparoscopic group reach statistical significance . Moreover , report order represent overall survival , patient follow least 3 year treatment . Therefore , necessary project conduct least 3 year . Based preliminary result previous 2-year conduction project , find laparoscopic technique facilitate patient rectal cancer CCRT le surgical invasiveness , faster postoperative recovery , similar extent dissection number harvest lymph node , increase tumor dissemination surgical manipulation , compare traditional open surgery . This encouraging result inspire u complete 3-year project , view enhance academic reputation Taiwan Colorectal Surgery quality clinical management patient rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
