	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain good understanding effect lumbopelvic manual therapy lower extremity biomechanics arthrogenic muscle response . As result study , also hope physical therapist , athletic trainer , physical medicine rehabilitation provider gain well understand low extremity injury scientific evidence provide patient technique would allow efficient return activity daily live without restriction possibly prevent future injury minimize risk osteoarthritis . The objective study : - Determine amount duration arthrogenic muscle response quadriceps muscle follow lumbopelvic joint manipulation . - Determine effect lumbopelvic joint manipulation temporospatial parameter gait cadence , step length , velocity mean peak low extremity joint moment . - Determine correlation exist patellofemoral joint pain lumbopelvic joint dysfunction . - Determine amount change clinical outcome measure score follow lumbopelvic joint manipulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well know musculoskeletal dysfunction one joint limit joint related dysfunction joint proximal distal kinetic chain . Recent research focus relationship alter low extremity kinematics common musculoskeletal pathology . Pain often associate musculoskeletal pathology one strong stimulus affect functional activity negative manner . Following injury chronic dysfunction , inhibitory neuron decrease ability musculature fully recruit excitatory motor neuron . This lead aberrant movement pattern different activation muscle . Muscle inhibition attribute possible source alter motor activation pattern . Pain result cause musculoskeletal dysfunction necessarily precede inhibition , contribute effect . The presence muscle inhibition consider limiting factor rehabilitation musculoskeletal pathology . If muscle inhibition properly address , individual athlete alike , able appropriately meet demand activity decrease risk future injury . One technique use determine presence muscle inhibition measure ability muscle produce maximal voluntary isometric contraction compare value ability contralateral muscle . Since contralateral limb may also experience muscle inhibition , difficult obtain accurate measurement amount muscle inhibition occur ipsilateral limb . A suggested solution utilize burst-superimposition technique provide muscle supramaximal stimulus recruit remain muscle fiber stimulate . Treatment muscle inhibition multifaceted . Utilization manual therapy technique joint manipulation mobilization direct lumbopelvic region show successful disinhibiting low extremity muscle . Previous study demonstrate sacroiliac joint manipulation disinhibited quadriceps muscle individual anterior knee pain . One limitation study observe immediate decrease quadriceps inhibition duration treatment effect unknown . Effects disinhibition low extremity muscle duration disinhibition determine time . It also unknown effect manual therapy treatment direct lumbopelvic region functional activity walk , squat , ascending/descending stair . By examine effect , attempt provide scientific evidence validate common clinical practice rehabilitative medicine .</detailed_description>
