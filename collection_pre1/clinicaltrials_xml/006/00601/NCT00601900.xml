	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study tamoxifen citrate letrozole together bevacizumab see well work compare tamoxifen citrate letrozole alone treat woman stage III stage IV breast cancer . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen citrate* letrozole may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may help control breast cancer stop growth blood vessel tumor . It yet know whether give hormone therapy effective without bevacizumab treating advance breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Citrate Letrozole With Without Bevacizumab Treating Women With Stage III Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival letrozole therapy alone combination letrozole therapy plus bevacizumab first-line treatment woman estrogen- and/or progesterone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare proportion patient receive letrozole alone , remain progression-free 6 12 month , receive letrozole plus bevacizumab . II . To compare incidence objective response ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) patient receive letrozole without bevacizumab , determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , exclude patient non-measurable disease . III . To compare incidence clinical benefit ( CR + PR + stable disease &gt; = 6 month ) patient receive letrozole without bevacizumab . IV . To compare duration objective response patient receive letrozole without bevacizumab . V. To compare time treatment failure patient receive letrozole without bevacizumab ; time treatment failure define interval randomization progression , toxicity , withdrawn consent go onto non-protocol therapy . VI . To compare overall survival patient receive letrozole without bevacizumab , include probability survival 36 month . V. To compare toxicity level bevacizumab arm arm without bevacizumab letrozole-treated patient tamoxifen-treated patient . VI . To compare progression-free survival overall survival patient receive endocrine therapy without bevacizumab ( combine letrozole tamoxifen* patient subgroup ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare baseline change serial level circulate endothelial cell circulate tumor cell patient treat endocrine therapy alone endocrine therapy plus bevacizumab , explore relationship marker progression free survival . II . To conduct proteomic analysis longitudinal sample patient advanced-stage disease undergoing hormonal therapy define new serum-based biomarkers related disease activity . III . To identify biologic correlate predict progression-free survival ( PFS ) response therapy . IV . To conduct pharmacogenomic assessment candidate variant vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , cytochrome P450 system ( CYP ) family 2 , subfamily D , polypeptide 6 ( 2D6 ) , CYP family 19 ( CYP19 ) gene evaluate association PFS study outcome . V. To identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) associate progression free survival genome-wide approach ( GWAS ) . VI . To identify factor chronological age predict risk grade 3 , 4 5 toxicity bevacizumab endocrine therapy mean functional age assessment measure ; factor study include : functional status , comorbid medical condition , cognitive function , psychological state , social support nutritional status . VII . To perform exploratory analysis ability factor include functional age assessment ( either individual combination ) , predict risk grade 3 , 4 5 toxicity . VIII . To evaluate longitudinal change parameter factor describe objective VI therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . NOTE : The placebo-controlled portion study cancel 5-15-10 . ARM I : Patients receive endocrine therapy* ( tamoxifen citrate letrozole ) orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive endocrine therapy* ( tamoxifen citrate letrozole ) PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year annually 3 year . * NOTE : As 5/15/2011 , patient receive letrozole .</detailed_description>
