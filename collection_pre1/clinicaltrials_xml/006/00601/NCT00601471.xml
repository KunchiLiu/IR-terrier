	<brief_summary>The overall aim project determine effect tibiofibular joint manipulation neuromuscular response fibularis longus soleus muscle individual chronic ankle instability . Another aim study determine long term effect tibiofibular joint manipulation range motion self-reported function . We hypothesize manipulation apply distal tibiofibular joint result great muscle activation , improve functional dorsiflexion ROM , increase FAAM score compare tibiofibular joint manipulation apply proximal joint . We hypothesize distal proximal tibiofibular joint manipulation result great muscle activation , improve functional dorsiflexion ROM , increase FAAM score treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Muscle weakness common impairment follow injury joint . Individuals lateral ankle sprain show demonstrate weakness inhibition fibularis longus soleus muscle . Recently , change positional alignment talus , tibia , fibula implicate subpopulation individual chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) . Clinically manifest decrease posterior glide talus decrease dorsiflexion ROM . Another positional fault note occur distal tibiofibular joint . A subpopulation individual history CAI demonstrate slight anterior displacement fibula relative tibia . The cause malpositioning unknown , manual therapeutic intervention may offer ability restore normal joint arthrokinematics muscle function . It unknown correction positional fault effect muscle inhibition ankle . Since muscle inhibition neurological reflexive reaction , think traditional strengthening treatment technique may fully address dysfunction . Manual therapeutic intervention dual effect neuromuscular system restore normal joint arthrokinematics . Evidence suggest joint manipulation able disinhibit even facilitate local distant muscle . This likely occur due afferent response structure around manipulate joint . Comprehensive treatment intervention restore normal joint function , optimal motoneuron pool excitability , strength , pain-free previous level function need develop prevent future dysfunction osteoarthritis . Currently study examine effect tibiofibular joint manipulation neuromuscular response ankle musculature effect range motion function . The purpose study examine acute effect tibiofibular joint manipulation neuromuscular response fibularis longus soleus muscle determine long term effect range motion function individual CAI . The first research question address tibiofibular joint manipulation immediately affect activation fibularis longus soleus muscle . The second question address joint manipulation affect range motion functional outcome three week period . Changes ankle dorsiflexion range motion ( ROM ) , navicular drop , Step Down Test , Balance Error Scoring System , Foot Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) use determine clinically significant change occur intervention period .</detailed_description>
