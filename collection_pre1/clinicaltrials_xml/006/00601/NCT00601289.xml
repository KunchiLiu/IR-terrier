	<brief_title>Temozolomide Treating Patients With Invasive Pituitary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess effect temozolomide pituitary tumor growth patient invasive pituitary tumor . - To assess effect temozolomide pituitary tumor response duration tumor response patient . Secondary - To assess effect temozolomide pituitary tumor hormone secretion patient . - To assess effect temozolomide aspects pituitary function patient . - To assess overall safety tolerability temozolomide patient . - To assess overall quality life patient treat temozolomide . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 12 course , patient achieve complete partial tumor response may continue receive temozolomide investigator 's discretion absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample collect periodically assess methylation status methyl-guanine methyl-transferase promoter ( MGMT ) gene quantitate immunocytochemical expression tumor suppressor protein p53 , p16 , p27 . Tissue sample also analyze microarray proteomics determine genetic `` signature '' invasive v non-invasive pituitary tumor determine signature correlate response temozolomide . Blood sample also periodically biomarker laboratory study . Patients complete quality life questionnaire periodically . After completion study therapy , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
