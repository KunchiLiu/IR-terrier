	<brief_title>A Multi-Center Phase 2 Study VEGF Trap Single Agent Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate aflibercept single agent adult patient advance refractory , relapse , untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . - To determine 3-month progression-free survival follow treatment least 4 course aflibercept patient . Secondary - To determine correlation pre-treatment expression VEGFR1 VEGFR2 marrow myeloblast disease response aflibercept . - To determine bone marrow microvessel density ( MVD ) pre-treatment correlate disease response aflibercept , decrease MVD follow treatment correlate change bone marrow blast percentage ( disease response ) . - To assess change circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) pharmacodynamic marker aflibercept activity possible correlate disease response aflibercept . - To measure blood level free VEGF versus VEGF bound aflibercept post-treatment determine choose dose aflibercept sufficient bind detectable soluble VEGF patient . - To characterize population pharmacokinetics aflibercept associate interpatient variability explore demographic clinical covariates . - To derive individual estimate duration VEGF-saturating aflibercept concentration systematically present examine distribution across population . - To explore potential relationship systemic-free bound aflibercept level safety efficacy data . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyze peak plasma-free aflibercept level first infusion , trough plasma-free bound aflibercept level prior subsequent infusion 60 day last infusion , anti-aflibercept antibody via ELISA method ; circulate endothelial cell ( CEC 's ) via ELISA flow cytometry determine correlation change circulate endothelial cell change bone marrow blast percentage ( i.e. , disease response ) ; myeloblast expression VEGFR-1 VRGFR-2 via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; endothelial progenitor cell colony form unit ( EPC-CFU 's ) determine via situ stain change circulate endothelial progenitor follow treatment aflibercept correlate disease response , subpopulation patient identify pre-treatment circulate EPC-CFU 's may benefit aflibercept ; bone marrow microvessel density ( MVD ) determination via immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 60 day .</detailed_description>
