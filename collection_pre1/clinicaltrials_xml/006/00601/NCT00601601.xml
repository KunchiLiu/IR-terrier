	<brief_title>Identifying Biomarkers Early Detection Cancer Patients With Cervical Dysplasia Carcinoma Situ Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify catalogue genetic alteration protein change associate developmental stage cervical cancer . - To identify ranked list candidate gene drive transformation premalignant lesion tumor study validation molecular target novel early detection treatment design . Secondary - To complete genome scan high density analysis gene protein expression identify recurrent genetic protein change cancer . - To confirm change cluster specific chromosomal region harbor tumor suppressor oncogene . OUTLINE : Patients undergo biopsy cervical tissue follow loop electrocautery excision procedure ( LEEP ) ( remove tissue surround area biopsied ) . RNA , DNA , protein extract cell provide material construction libraries Serial Analysis Gene Expression ( SAGE analysis ) ; hybridization Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Comparative Genome Hybridization array ( BAC CGH array ) ; analysis use protein chip array proteomics . Resulting data cod sample provide gene expression protein profile . The coded molecular datasets link , analyze , compare use variety statistical software identify putative gene , gene alteration , proteins interest . Some sample may bank future study .</detailed_description>
