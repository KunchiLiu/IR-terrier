	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1. develop normative database serum creatine kinase ( CK ) responses basic military training ( BMT ) ; 2. determine incidence exertional rhabdomyolysis ( ER ) among large cohort recruit undergo BMT ; 3. assess impact climate incidence ER BMT ; 4. determine incidence candidate gene may associate increase risk ER .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based review scientific information , identify several genetic variety polymorphisms may associate increase risk muscle injury and/or heat illness . As part recruitment process provide write study information , present brief oral PowerPoint presentation study design schedule , time address question yet answer prior issue consent form agree participate . Participation study entirely voluntary ; either agree refuse participate absolutely effect status recruit stand basic training . You pay participation study . While drill sergeant company commander aware participate study , occur schedule purpose fellow participant excuse 3 blood draw take place basic physical training begin . When consent participate study , may place limitation use blood sample select one option provide last page consent form . If point decide continue study , detailed instruction withdrawal consent form . Potential Risks : Participation study increase risk develop rhabdomyolysis . If participant develop either rhabdomyolysis high CK level , perform additional DNA analyse certain condition associate exercise intolerance . Several inherited muscle disease may diagnose adulthood may first become apparent episode exercise intolerance . Diagnosis condition ground dismissal Army , essential family aware hereditary condition present . Risks Associated With Genetic Analysis : There certain additional risk uniquely associate study involve genetic testing . Using advanced genetic analysis , information DNA structure ( genetic information ) help determine risk develop certain genetic disease run family . This genetic information unique may indicate change future health status life expectancy , well possibly , child relative . Besides medical risk , genetic test carry certain social risk . It affect insurability , employability , personal family planning , family relationship , immigration status , instigate paternity lawsuit , associate social stigmatization . Finding either carry gene associate serious illness cause significant stress psychological harm . Privacy Confidentiality : All information provide , part study confidential protect full extent provide law . Information record relate study accessible person directly involve conduct study member Eisenhower Army Medical Center Institutional Review Committee ( IRC ) , USUHS Research Department , governmental agency , provide oversight protection human research volunteer . All questionnaire , form , chart keep restricted-access , lock cabinet use blood sample store restricted access , lock freezer USUHS five year , depend participant wish blood use . After five year remain blood sample destroy along code logbook . To enhance privacy information , data enter database individual response identify . After verification database information , paper copy contain identifier shred . You inform general result study since research study , may review literature publish result . However , result reveal mutation gene indicate susceptibility specific disorder ( malignant hyperthermia , CPT II deficiency , McArdle 's , AMP deaminase deficiency MCAD deficiency ) , inform ; also inform General Medical Officer ( GMO ) . If need genetic counselor , arrange well GMO . The genetic result associate dismissal military service release anyone include . Complete confidentiality promise , particularly military personnel , information bear health may require report appropriate medical command authority . Data Management : Data storage analysis conduct desktop computer . The computer store data back daily PI data manager access hard drive disc . One copy disc maintain secure lock office . A copy data set also store one USUHS server use secure site , back daily . Data file convert SPSS™ datasets process merge participant research data . For write questionnaire form , project use computer data management analysis system compose digital scan technology Teleform™ . This technique minimize data entry error clean data file on-going basis . In addition , built-in range detection strategy identify outlier may represent error . In brief , form complete participant scan optical scanner interpret Teleform™ Reader , check miss , illogical , out-of-range value . The Reader also identify data ( 1 ) incorrectly complete , ( 2 ) mistakenly mark , ( 3 ) character satisfy Reader 's confidence level . Those meet parameter hold manual review correction . Correction do Teleform™ Verifier . Once verification complete , data export SPSS™ database software statistical analysis . The database program check illicit value calculate parameter derive raw data . Storage Participant Samples : Your blood sample store appropriate condition . All sample give numerical code store without participant name identifier . This code enter logbook maintain Dr. William Campbell appropriate person . All sample store USUHS 5 year unless otherwise instruct participant . Use Sample Investigators : The protocol specify gene examine . However , course study , candidate gene identify polymorphism may appear literature . If clear justification examine association rhabdomyolysis , carry analysis contact obtain permission . All analysis relate specifically state objective unrelated research effort . There secondary use sample obtain subject since sample share investigator outside study . The blood sample obtain research use commercial purpose . Withdrawal Research : You right withdraw study option withdraw blood sample ( ) time . If decide stop participation study , need contact medical monitor and/or one member research team inform one decision . They withdraw study blood sample , questionnaire muscle exam perform . If participation study stop end study , information already collect keep research team include study result . This information maintain duration study . Participant Resource : Members study team available answer question time study , particular , three brief exam blood draws field . In addition , medical monitor study , Dr. Michael Campbell , also serve study ombudsman available resource study participant .</detailed_description>
