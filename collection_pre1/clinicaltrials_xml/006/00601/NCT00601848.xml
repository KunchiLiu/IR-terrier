	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Photodynamic therapy use drug , porfimer sodium , absorbed tumor cell . The drug become active expose light . When drug active , tumor cell kill . Giving photodynamic therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well photodynamic therapy give surgery work treat patient resectable non-small cell lung cancer spread pleura .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Treating Patients With Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Spread Pleura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall survival rate patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) malignant pleural spread treat standard front-line chemotherapy follow surgical resection intra-operative porfimer sodium ( Photofrin® ) -mediated photodynamic therapy . - To determine feasibility toxicity standard front-line chemotherapy follow surgical resection intra-operative Photofrin®-mediated photodynamic therapy patient . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival pleural progression-free survival patient . - To determine absolute Photofrin® level tumor normal tissue resect patient use spectrofluorometric method . - To determine tumor normal tissue ratio Photofrin® patient . - To measure optical property tumor normal tissue situ . - To compare Photofrin® concentration tumor normal tissue make situ measurement measurement make spectrofluorometric method . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 2-4 course standard front-line chemotherapy prior surgery ( complete front-line chemotherapy ) . Patients receive porfimer sodium ( Photofrin® ) IV 5-15 minute . Approximately 24 hour receive porfimer sodium , patient undergo surgery remove primary tumor pleural disease thickness 5 mm less* . Patients undergo intraoperative photodynamic therapy residual disease . Some patient may undergo postoperative radiotherapy mediastinum and/or surgical scar clinically indicate . NOTE : *If disease resect less 5 mm , PDT deliver Tumor normal tissue sample obtain surgical specimen examine prior light delivery time thoracotomy , light delivery . Tissue sample analyze porphyrin level use spectrofluorometric assay tissue specimens situ optical method intra-operatively . Samples also assess V-cadherin , marker oxidative stress , marker associate photosensitizer uptake , marker angiogenesis , marker hypoxia , activation signal pathway component ( include EGFR , p38 MAPK , Akt , p42/44 MAPK ) via immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
