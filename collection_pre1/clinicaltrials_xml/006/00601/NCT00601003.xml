	<brief_title>Study Nifurtimox Treat Refractory Relapsed Neuroblastoma Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study do test effect drug , nifurtimox , neuroblastoma medulloblastoma child . Nifurtimox drug use South America many year treat parasitic disease know Chagas Disease . It approve Food Drug Administration routine use neuroblastoma medulloblastoma United States , limit early observation suggest nifurtimox may anti tumor activity neuroblastoma medulloblastoma . From preliminary trial nifurtimox determine safely tolerate dose nifurtimox use neuroblastoma patient ( 30mg/kg/day ) . The dose determine Phase I study safe , dose use study . From clinical experience South America , know child tolerate nifurtimox give mouth , appear long-term side effect use treat Chagas Disease . Based laboratory animal study , believe drug level similar use treat Chagas Disease may shrink/kill neuroblastoma cell , especially combine chemotherapy drug . We know whether nifurtimox shrink/kill tumor cell effectively child . Therefore , major goal study learn nifurtimox combination chemotherapy drug effective shrinking/killing neuroblastoma medulloblastoma cell .</detailed_description>
