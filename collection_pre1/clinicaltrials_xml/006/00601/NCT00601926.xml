	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well bevacizumab work treat patient unresectable metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate progression-free survival bevacizumab administer patient unresectable and/or metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma . - To evaluate safety bevacizumab patient . Secondary - To examine , preliminary manner , response rate bevacizumab patient . - To collect store blood urine sample future analysis . - To evaluate overall survival bevacizumab administer patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
