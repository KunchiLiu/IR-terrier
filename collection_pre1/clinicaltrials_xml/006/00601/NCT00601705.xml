	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy , surgery , radiation therapy work treat patient locoregionally advanced cancer esophagus , gastroesophageal junction , stomach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epirubicin , Oxaliplatin Fluorouracil ( EOF ) Cancer Esophagus , Gastroesophageal Junction , Stomach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess feasibility tolerability induction chemotherapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil ( EOF ) , follow surgical resection postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprise fluorouracil cisplatin patient locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma esophagus , gastroesophageal junction , gastric cardia . Secondary - To determine rate complete partial response three course EOF induction chemotherapy . - To compare recurrence-free overall survival patient treat regimen vs historical control institution . - To compare patterns failure patient treat regimen vs historical control institution . OUTLINE : - Induction chemotherapy : Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV 3-15 minute oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Surgery : Four week completion induction chemotherapy , patient locoregionally confine disease ( T0-4 , N0-1 , M0-1a ) undergo transthoracic esophagogastrectomy total gastrectomy Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy , depend location extent tumor time surgery . - Postoperative chemoradiotherapy : Beginning 6-10 week surgery , patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week approximately 6 week . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously cisplatin IV continuously 96 hour week 1 4 radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8-12 week 3 year .</detailed_description>
