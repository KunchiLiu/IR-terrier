	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , capecitabine , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . External-beam radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Panitumumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving panitumumab together chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give panitumumab together chemotherapy external-beam radiation therapy work treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab , Chemotherapy , External-Beam Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate 1-year survival rate patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer treat panitumumab continuous infusion fluorouracil administer concurrently external-beam radiotherapy follow gemcitabine panitumumab . Secondary - To determine overall survival , time disease progression , confirm response rate , duration response , time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - To determine adverse event patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : - Panitumumab chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-38 . Patients also receive panitumumab IV 1 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour daily OR oral capecitabine twice daily begin day 1 continue last day radiotherapy . - Panitumumab chemotherapy : Beginning 4-6 week completion panitumumab chemoradiotherapy , patient receive panitumumab IV 1 hour day 1 15 gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course . Patients proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive panitumumab IV 1 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
