	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use eflornithine diclofenac may stop cancer grow patient sun-damaged skin . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect well eflornithine work compare diclofenac , give alone together , treat patient sun-damaged skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eflornithine and/or Diclofenac Treating Patients With Sun-Damaged Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine combination therapy topical eflornithine hydrochloride ointment topical diclofenac sodium gel 3-months increase efficacy versus either agent use alone treatment moderately sun-damaged skin . Secondary - To evaluate safety sequential administration topical eflornithine hydrochloride ointment topical diclofenac sodium gel . - To determine correlation karyometric change histopathologic , immunohistochemical , clinical , genetic polymorphism data . - To obtain material microarray analysis . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Eflornithine hydrochloride : Patients apply topical eflornithine hydrochloride ointment leave forearm twice daily day 1-90 . - Diclofenac sodium : Patients apply topical diclofenac sodium gel leave forearm daily day 1-90 . - Eflornithine hydrochloride/Diclofenac sodium : Patients apply topical eflornithine hydrochloride ointment arm I twice daily topical diclofenac sodium gel arm II daily day 1-90 . Prior treatment , three 4-mm punch biopsy take skin leave lateral forearm assessment histopathology , cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme p53 expression , apoptosis , nuclear chromatin karyometry . Tissue also obtain future use microarray analysis . Blood drawn assessment ornithine decarboxylase polymorphism banking subsequent study . Biopsies repeat 2-3 week completion treatment . Digital photograph take baseline 1-2 week completion study therapy document improvement sun damage , appearance new skin lesion , toxicity .</detailed_description>

Subjects may reconsider eligibility 30 day last topical treatment . Individuals treatment basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin leave forearm within six month prior evaluation study eligible . If interested , subject encourage return reevaluation sixmonth period . Individuals moderately highly immunosuppressed virtue medication disease allow participate . This category include individual undergo bone marrow solid organ transplant , receive immunosuppressive therapy systemic chemotherapy rheumatologic agent infliximab ( Remicade® ) . However , individual mildly suppressive disorder diabetes mellitus mildly immunosuppressive therapy inhale steroid asthma eligible participation . Doses 20 mg prednisone per day equivalent dose steroid allow .</criteria>
