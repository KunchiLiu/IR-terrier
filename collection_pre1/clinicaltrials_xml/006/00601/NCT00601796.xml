	<detailed_description>This protocol describe phase II study involve patient stage IV adenocarcinoma lung . Treatment consist Cyclophosphamide ( 300 mg/mÂ² ) give IV day 1 day 57 . On day 4 immunization intradermal vaccine injection 4 separate site ( bilateral upper arm bilateral upper thigh repeat every 14 day times 2 follow every 28 day times 3 ( day 4 , 18 , 32 , 60 , 88 , 116 ) . Decavac ( tetanus shot ) 0.5 cc intramuscular ( IM ) give first vaccine . ATRA ( 150 mg/m2/day ) oral three time daily ( TID ) dosing administer first fourth vaccine ( day 5-7 &amp; day 61-63 ) . Those patient achieve stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) restaging initial 6 vaccine receive additional vaccine every 3 month disease progression . The vaccine consist GM.CD40L bystander cell admixed equivalent number 2 allogeneic tumor cell line . There +/- 7 day window study related exam , test , procedure .</detailed_description>
