	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vandetanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vandetanib together temozolomide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose vandetanib temozolomide treat patient advance solid tumor remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vandetanib Temozolomide Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine maximum tolerate dose concurrently administer vandetanib temozolomide patient unresectable , advance solid tumor . - To describe toxicity profile regimen patient . - To describe response rate patient treat regimen . - To describe effect therapy angiogenesis-related translational endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients receive escalate dos oral vandetanib daily day 1-28 oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline prior treatment course correlative laboratory study , include evaluation plasma VEGF level ELISA , serum angiogenesis assay , measurement circulate endothelial cell population ( CD133 , CD34 , CD146 ) . Frozen serum plasma sample also store future research study .</detailed_description>
