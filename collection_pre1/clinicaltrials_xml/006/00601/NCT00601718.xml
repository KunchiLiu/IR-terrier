	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide see well work treat patient relapsed refractory lymphoma previously untreated T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma . Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vorinostat together rituximab combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose vorinostat combine RICE chemotherapy patient relapse lymphoid malignancy . II . To determine safety toxicity regimen . III . To gain preliminary assessment efficacy regimen . IV . To determine ability proceed peripheral blood stem cell collection follow regimen ( impact regimen stem cell reserve ) . V. To describe vorinostat concentration attain near MTD . VI . To evaluate change histone acetylation pattern pro-apoptotic protein primary target ( tumor ) non-target peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) cell follow high-dose HDAC inhibition . VII . To describe gene expression profile change tumor non-tumor cell follow high-dose HDAC inhibition . OUTLINE : This phase I/II dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 , ifosfamide IV continuously 24 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 4 , etoposide IV 1 hour day 3-5 . Patients CD20+ also receive rituximab IV day 3 , 4 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
