	<brief_title>Digital Colposcopy Finding Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify potential improvement noninvasive method diagnose cervical dysplasia neoplasia use digital colposcopy fluorescence spectroscopic imaging . - To measure fluorescence reflectance image human cervix vivo use digital colposcopy . - To evaluate effect acetic acid image contrast obtain . - To compare device performance colposcopic impression histopathologic interpretation tissue remove standard loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants undergo routine colposcopy part regular colposcopic evaluation . The digital colposcope use take fluorescence reflectance image vagina cervix . Participants also undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) . The digital colposcopic image compare tissue remove LEEP . Additional surrogate biomarkers development also measure use tissue sample remove LEEP , quantitative histopathology measurement , DNA test copy number change , test incorporation viral HPV DNA .</detailed_description>
