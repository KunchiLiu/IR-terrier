	<brief_title>F-18 16 Alpha-Fluoroestradiol-Labeled Positron Emission Tomography Predicting Response First-Line Hormone Therapy Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate ability [ ^18F ] FES positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET/computed tomography ( CT ) uptake level standard uptake value ( SUV ) &lt; 1.5 predict overall response ( OR ) first line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate independent role [ ^18F ] FES predict response time progression patient treat first-line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . II . Examine role [ ^18F ] FES predicting OR clinical benefit ( CB ) , concert tissue assay level estrogen receptor ( ER ) messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) measure use quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , semi-quantitative interpretation estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) , androgen receptor ( AR ) , human epidermal growth factor-2 ( HER2 ) , addition serial measure hormone level plasma . III . Evaluate relationship among [ ^18F ] FES , semi-quantitative ER immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , ER mRNA measure quantitative PCR . IV . Document safety profile [ ^18F ] FES PET newly diagnose patient metastatic breast cancer . V. Evaluate FES SUV &lt; 1.5 optimal cutpoint predicting OR first-line endocrine therapy metastatic breast cancer . VI . Estimate rate [ ^18F ] FES SUV &lt; 1.5 newly diagnose metastatic breast cancer patient plan course endocrine therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo [ ^18F ] FES PET scan . Patients also undergo standard clinical fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -PET FDG-PET/CT scan 14 day prior [ ^18F ] FES PET scan . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 6 month .</detailed_description>
