	<brief_title>Fludarabine Rituximab With Without Lenalidomide Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Symptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine two-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) remission induction four different chemo-immunotherapy combination patient untreated , symptomatic , lower-risk high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) decide four arm , , take forward randomize phase III trial . II . To determine induction response fludarabine phosphate rituximab ( FR ) fludarabine phosphate , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) arm , along consolidation response lenalidomide patient CLL . III . To determine toxicity four chemoimmunotherapy combination consolidation therapy lenalidomide . IV . To determine induction response toxicity FCR patient deletion ( del ) ( 11q22.3 ) along consolidation response , 2-year PFS toxicity lenalidomide specific genetic group . V. To determine effect pretreatment biologic characteristic clinical outcome , attain complete response induction therapy progression-free survival . VI . To collect relapse sample determine frequency clonal evolution among patient immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region ( IgVH ) mutate unmutated disease study mechanisms resistance chemoimmunotherapy . VII . To determine flow cytometry-negative status immediately post-therapy 24 month study entry effective surrogate marker prolong progression-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm ( Arms A , B , C ) . Patients Arm A B find del ( 11q22.3 ) positive assign Arm D begin course 2 induction therapy . ARM A ( remission-induction [ RI ] therapy fludarabine phosphate rituximab ) : Participants receive induction therapy ( every 28 day 6 cycle ) : rituximab intravenously ( IV ) 1-4 hour day 1 ( 50 mg/m^2 ) , 3 ( 325 mg/m^2 ) , 5 ( 375 mg/m^2 ) course 1 day 1 ( 375 mg/m^2 ) subsequent course . Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m^2/day IV 30 minute orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . ARM B ( RI therapy fludarabine phosphate rituximab follow remission-consolidation [ RC ] therapy lenalidomide ) : Participants receive induction therapy ( every 28 day 6 cycle ) : rituximab IV 1-4 hour day 1 ( 50 mg/m^2 ) , 3 ( 325 mg/m^2 ) , 5 ( 375 mg/m^2 ) course 1 day 1 ( 375 mg/m^2 ) subsequent course . Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m^2/day IV 30 minute PO day 1-5 . Participants without progression receive consolidation therapy : lenalidomide 5mg/day cycle 1 , 10 mg/day cycle 2-6 PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 28 day cycle . ARM C ( RI therapy fludarabine phosphate , rituximab , cyclophosphamide ) : Participants receive induction therapy ( every 28 day 6 cycle ) : rituximab IV 4 hour day 1 ( 50mg/m^2 ) 3 ( 325 mg/m^2 ) course 1 day 1 ( 500 mg/m^2 ) subsequent course . Patients receive fludarabine phosphate ( age &lt; 70 : 25 mg/m^2/day ; age &gt; = 70 : 20 mg/m^2/day ) IV piggyback 30 minute PO ( 32 mg/m^2/day ) follow cyclophosphamide ( age &lt; 70 : 250 mg/m^2/day ; age &gt; = 70 : 150 mg/m^2/day ) IV piggyback 30 minute day 1-3 . ARM D ( RI therapy fludarabine phosphate , rituximab , cyclophosphamide follow RC therapy lenalidomide ) : Patients receive first course induction therapy Arm A B re-assigned Arm D. Beginning course 2 , patient receive rituximab IV ( 500 mg/m^2 ) day 1 fludarabine phosphate ( age &lt; 70 : 25 mg/m^2/day ; age &gt; = 70 : 20 mg/m^2/day ) IV piggyback 30 minute PO ( 32 mg/m^2/day ) cyclophosphamide IV ( age &lt; 70 : 250 mg/m^2/day ; age &gt; = 70 : 150 mg/m^2/day ) piggyback 30 minute day 1-3 . Participants without progression receive consolidation therapy : lenalidomide 5mg/day cycle 1 , 10 mg/day cycle 2-6 PO QD day 1-21 28 day cycle . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 15 year .</detailed_description>
