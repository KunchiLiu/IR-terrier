	<brief_title>Deferasirox Treating Patients With Iron Overload After Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety deferasirox give 6 month reduce liver iron concentration patient transfusional iron overload undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Secondary - To evaluate efficacy deferasirox reduce liver iron overload patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral deferasirox daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
