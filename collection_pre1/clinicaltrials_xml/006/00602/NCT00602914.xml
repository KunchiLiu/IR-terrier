	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assess Safety , PK PD Insulin Injected Via MicronJet Conventional Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration insulin skin many potential advantage include improved kinetics reduce pain . Today , insulin inject SQ space , use , case , various device incorporate standard metal needle usually cause considerable pain discomfort patient . NanoPass develop microneedle base needle substitute intradermal injection . This device require minimal expertise expect cause minimal pain injection . The objective study compare pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics insulin Novorapid® ( Novo Nordisk ) inject via MicronJet device intradermally , conventional needle inject SQ space .</detailed_description>
