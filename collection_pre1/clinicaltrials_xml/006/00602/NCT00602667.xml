	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : In study combination anti-cancer drug ( chemotherapy ) use treat brain tumor young child . Using chemotherapy give brain time develop radiation give . The chemotherapy study include drug methotrexate . This drug important part two clinical trial result best survival result child le 3 year age medulloblastoma . Most patient treat trial also receive radiation carefully target area tumor . This type radiation ( focal conformal proton beam radiotherapy ) may result few problem think learn radiation whole brain spinal cord . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy work treat young patient newly diagnose central nervous system tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient medulloblastoma diagnose prior 3rd birthday contribute biology therapeutic primary objective protocol . Furthermore patient ≥3 &lt; 5 year old time diagnosis also include cohort primary objective long meet eligibility criterion outline Amendment 8.0 protocol . Patients 3-5 year old age cohort enrol previous version protocol meet criterion outline Amendment 8.0 protocol exclude outcome analysis biology therapeutic primary objective protocol . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify pattern methylation profile associate progression-free survival among young pediatric patient medulloblastoma treat risk-adapted therapy . - To estimate event-free survival distribution young medulloblastoma patient treat risk-adapted therapy . Secondary - To perform high-resolution genome-wide analysis chromosomal abnormality gene expression pattern , evaluate relationship clinicopathological variable . - To evaluate specific tumor type molecular abnormality suspect prognostic therapeutic significance . - To evaluate feasibility collect frozen fix tumor sample analysis use high-resolution molecular biology tool . - To estimate event-free overall survival patient treat proposed risk-adapted therapy regimen , descriptively compare survival rate historical control . - To estimate rate local distant disease progression patient treat focal radiotherapy ( RT ) post-operative tumor bed use 5 mm clinical target volume margin . - To estimate objective response rate ( sustain 8 week ) induction chemotherapy include high-dose intravenous methotrexate patient residual metastatic disease . - To evaluate feasibility toxicity administer low-dose intravenous vinblastine conjunction induction chemotherapy patient metastatic disease . - To evaluate feasibility toxicity administer consolidation therapy include cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetically targeted topotecan patient metastatic disease , estimate sustain ( 8 week ) objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) therapy patient measurable residual disease induction . - To evaluate feasibility toxicity administer oral maintenance therapy young child . - To use quantitative magnetic resonance ( MR ) measure ( volumetric , diffusion , perfusion ) young brain tumor patient receive chemotherapy include high-dose intravenous methotrexate assess impact treatment develop brain . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease risk ( low-risk v intermediate-risk vs high-risk ) . Therapy consist risk adapt induction , consolidation maintenance chemotherapy . Focal irradiation give intermediate risk patient reach least 12 month age upon completion induction . Intermediate risk patient receive low risk chemotherapy delay RT age 12 month . Patients may consent provide tumor tissue blood sample biological study . Tumor tissue analyze activation wnt signal pathway ( β-catenin ) , activation shh signal pathway ( Gli-1/SFRP1 ) , ERBB2 ; validation novel pattern gene expression via immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis ; loss chromosomes 6 , 8p , 9q22 , isochromosome 17q ; amplification MYCC , MYCN , MYCL ; validation genetic abnormality via interphase fluorescence situ hybridization ( iFISH ) ; construction gene expression profile via microarray analysis ; single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis DNA purity integrity use UV spectrophotometry agarose gel electrophoresis ; amplification DNA via PCR combination previously publish 'in-house ' generated primer ; potential oncogene tumor suppressor gene via DNA sequence analysis ; expression number cell signal protein implicate biology medulloblastoma via western blot ; expression additional protein encode gene associate SNP gene expression array analysis clinical disease behavior ; differential expression pattern gene detect use microarray analysis via RT-PCR . DNA extraction construction tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) tumor tissue also use future IHC FISH analysis . Blood sample analyze constitutional DNA patient whose tumor contain gene mutation via sequence analysis constitutional DNA ; cyclophosphamide metabolite via liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy method ; topotecan lactone via isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography assay fluorescence detection ; alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( AAGP ) concentration via immunoturbidimetric assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
