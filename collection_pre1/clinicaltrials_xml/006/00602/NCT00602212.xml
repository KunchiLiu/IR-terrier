	<brief_summary>Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) psychiatric disease characterize long-lasting anxiety focus specific object situation . According DSM-IV-TR essential feature GAD least six month `` excessive anxiety worry '' variety event situation . Anxiety worry often accompany variety physical symptom like restlessness , easily fatigue , difficulty concentrating , irritability , muscle tension disturb sleep . The high prevalence GAD general population severe limitation cause point necessity find new strategy treat efficient way . Within treatment GAD , physical ( relaxation control breathing ) , behavioral ( visualization control exposure ) cognitive control strategy ( challenge negative thought ) represent key part treatment , even hard learn . Given feature disease pervasive effect patient 's personal , occupational affective life , think could benefit ubiquitous treatment.We suggest , , improve treatment GAD use biofeedback enhance virtual reality ( VR ) system use relaxation , control exposure SIT . The use SIT context GAD motivate acknowledgment sometimes stressor ca n't avoid altered patient ca n't apply strategy focus finding solution . In instance , cop effort direct emotionally palliative set response acceptance , reframing perspective thinking . All cognitive change facilitate concomitant relaxation induce . The treatment involve two virtual reality component : I ) immersive virtual reality system experience therapist 's office ; II ) mobile exposure system allow patient perform virtual experience outpatient setting . The role mobile exposure system follow : - To present structure emotionally relevant content ubiquitous context . - To verify compliance patient eventually alert patient/therapist ; - To track real-time emotional level patient record later assessment therapist ; - To provide feedback patient able help cop content ; - To automatically contact therapist emotional level high preset cut-off value define therapist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient randomly assign follow group : ( 1 ) VR Mobile group ( VRMB ) include biofeedback - 7 subject ; ( 2 ) VR Mobile group ( VRM ) without biofeedback - 9 subject ; ( 3 ) wait list ( WL ) group - 8 subject : 1 . Virtual Reality + Mobile Phone without Biofeedback Condition ( VRM ) . In experimental condition patient receive eight-session VR-based treatment include relaxation exposure . In session 1 6 , patient explore beautiful VR tropical island ( experienced head-mounted display head-tracking ) follow predefined path lead different relax area : Campfire , Beach Waterfall . In area patient start relax observe flicker campfire , watch wave lap gently shore , look waterfall fish pond . Each experience support audio narrative base progressive muscle relaxation and/or autogenic technique . All environment develop ESIEA INTREPID team ( J.L . Dautin , J. Ardouin , F. Crison M. Le Renard -www.esiea.fr ) use 3DVIA 4.1 Virtools toolkit Dassault Syst√®mes - www.virtools.com.To improve efficacy train increase effect relaxation , patient experience home , use mobile phone , non-navigable version virtual reality environment experience therapy . The patient ask train relaxation ability least day entire duration treatment follow treatment plan provide therapist . In session 7 8 patient explored island reach Gazebo expose pre-selected word image relate personal stressful event . The patient ask use learned relaxation technique cope . 2 . Virtual Reality + Mobile Phone Biofeedback Condition ( VRMB ) . The patient experience protocol described , biofeedback support ( see Figure 2 ) . Specifically , session therapist , HR variation use modify specific feature virtual environment : 1 . Campfire ( session 1-2 ) . HR control fire intensity : reduction patient 's physiological activation reduces fire intensity disappear ; 2 . Beach ( session 3-4 ) . HR control movement wave : reduction patient 's physiological activation reduces movement wave ocean becomes completely calm ; 3 . Waterfall ( session 5-6 ) : HR control movement water : reduction patient 's physiological activation reduces movement water water flow become completely still ; 4 . Gazebo ( session 7-8 ) : HR control size stressful image video : reduction patient 's physiological activation reduces size stimulus disappear . This exercise design following procedure SIT . 3 . Waiting List Condition ( WL ) . This control condition , patient include wait list receive kind relaxation training .</detailed_description>
