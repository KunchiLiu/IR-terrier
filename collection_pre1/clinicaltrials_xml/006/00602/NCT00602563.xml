	<detailed_description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) characterize excessive , uncontrollable worry ( Barlow , et al. , 1986 ) lead medical over-utilization , poor perceive health , low rating quality life , impairment work result significant economic public health impact ( Wittchen et al. , 2002 ; Ballenger et al. , 2001 ) . Lifetime prevalence GAD high ( 5.7 % , Kessler , et al , 2005 ) , even high estimate primary care set ( 8.5 % , Roy-Byrne &amp; Wager , 2004 ) . Researchers establish relationship GAD attention bias threaten information ( Mogg &amp; Bradley 2005 ) . This knowledge , however , translate effective treatment disorder . This five-year , two site proposal aim test computerize treatment GAD double-blind , placebo-controlled study bridge basic attention bias research treatment outcome . We present result 7 study demonstrate efficacy attention modification program ( AMP ) ameliorate symptoms anxiety . Specifically , report result pilot study individual Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( n=24 , Dr Amir 's lab ) , high worry ( n=24 , Dr. Schmidt 's lab ) demonstrate effectiveness procedure describe proposal . In brief , intervention effective : ) change bias attention , b ) reduce symptom GAD , c ) maintain effect one year follow-up . This technique change attention bias GAD provide cost-effective easy administer treatment ground basic cognitive science may help reduce suffer individual anxiety . A large study would allow u test treatment examine generalizability intervention patient GAD along comorbid condition . Moreover , examine transportability intervention examine propose intervention two site . There currently 10 participant enrol new phase pilot data collection ( SDSU 6 , FSU 4 ) . The goal current proposal extend finding large group individual GAD examine generalizability result individual comorbid GAD . In current proposal test two hypothesis : 1 . Individuals GAD complete AMP show large reduction attention bias threat compare clinical monitoring group 2 . Individuals GAD complete AMP show large reduction anxiety symptom compare clinical monitoring group . 3 . Individuals GAD complete AR show large reduction anxiety symptom compare clinical monitoring group . Specifically , current proposal directly respond NIMH priority evaluate user-friendly intervention non-traditional delivery method increase access evidence-based intervention . We evaluate efficacy 12-week computer-delivered home-based treatment program GAD . Treatment comprise combination two intervention show efficacious treatment GAD . The Attention Modification Program ( AMP ) computerize program design facilitate attention disengagement threaten stimulus ( Amir et al. , 2009 ) . Applied Relaxation ( AR ) behavioral , skills-based intervention individual learn way reduce physiological cue associate anxiety worry ( Ã–st , 1987 ; Siev &amp; Chambless , 2007 ) . Following recommended guideline NIMH Workgroup Psychosocial Intervention Development ( Hollon et al. , 2002 ) , review evidence suggest treatment ideal candidate efficient , economical , widespread transportation evidence-based treatment GAD . This proposal potential significant public health impact evaluate new method deliver evidence-based intervention hard-to-reach population use innovative technology .</detailed_description>
