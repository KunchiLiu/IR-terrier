	<brief_title>Viral Therapy Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer That Did Not Respond Platinum Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability intravenous ( IV ) intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration wild-type reovirus ( REOLYSIN® ) . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose IP REOLYSIN® use fix dose IV REOLYSIN® . III . Determine objective response rate ( complete response partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) treatment IV IP REOLYSIN® patient recurrent , platinum-refractory ovarian epithelial , peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . ( Phase II ) ( phase II close 1/7/2011 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify viral replication tumor follow IV reovirus . II . To identify anti-reovirus antibody patient treat IV IP REOLYSIN® therapy . III . To identify viral replication abdominal washing patient undergo IV IP REOLYSIN® therapy . IV . To correlate response therapy Ras oncogene status . V. To evaluate double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase activity tumor . VI . To correlate molecular predictor response REOLYSIN® therapy . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study intraperitoneal ( IP ) wild-type reovirus administer fix dose IV wild-type reovirus . PHASE I : Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1-5 course 1 , follow insertion IP access port . Beginning course 2 , patient receive wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1-5 wild-type reovirus IP 10 minute day 1 2* . Treatment IV IP wild-type reovirus repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients undergo IP access port insertion begin treatment . Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1-5 IP ( maximum tolerate dose determine phase I ) 10 minute day 1 2* . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( phase II close 1/7/2011 ) . NOTE : *Patients receive IP wild-type reovirus day 2 3 course 3 . Prior IP wild-type reovirus administration , normal saline administer IP catheter withdrawn correlative study course 2 3 ( phase I ) course 1 2 ( phase II ) . Patients also undergo CT-guided percutaneous tumor biopsy day 2 course 3 ( phase I II ) . Samples analyze immunohistochemistry , RT-PCR , electron microscopy relevant molecular effect wild-type reovirus tumor normal tissue . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
