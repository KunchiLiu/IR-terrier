	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis psoriasis evolve epidermal hyperproliferation immune dysregulation recent year . A Th1 cytokine profile universally find psoriasis . Biologics target immune system become focus study . Raptiva ( Efalizumab ) one biologics indicate treatment psoriasis , first biologic approve use psoriasis EU ( EMEA ) . In USA , second biologic drug ( Amevive ) psoriasis . Raptiva humanize chimeric antibody CD11a ( LFA-1 ) , block interaction CD11and ICAM─1 , thus prevent lymphocyte trafficking . It use moderate severe chronic plaque type psoraisis . The first clinical trial Raptiva Asians iscurrently do department Dermatology , National Taiwan University Hospital incidence psoriatic arthritis ( either de novo aggravation preexist psoriatic arthritis ) significantly high previously report Western countries（30％ versus 7 % ，and personal communication doctor Hong-Kong Singapore also reveal similar safety profile . It seem likely racial difference present . Monocytes play central role pathogenesis psoriatic arthritis . It thus intrigue study pathogenesis Raptiva-induced aggravation psoriatic arthritis compare difference monocyes response presence Raptiva patient without Raptiva-induced psoriatic arthritis . In study , CD11a genomic polymorphism also investigate . The suudy provide u important information novel monoclonal antibody like Raptiva therapeutic detrimental action psoriasis . The short term benefit study pharmacogenomics pharmacoeconomics , find best candidate expensive drug . The long term goal clarification pathogenesis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis .</brief_summary>
