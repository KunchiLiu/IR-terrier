	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : The phase II trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , radiation therapy work treat patient undergo surgery locally advance pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To describe toxicity bevacizumab gemcitabine oxaliplatin , therapy give chemoradiotherapy , patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . - To describe toxicity bevacizumab oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , concomitant radiotherapy patient . - To define progression-free survival , time progression , overall survival patient treat regimen . Second - To determine percentage potentially resectable patient ultimately able proceed successful resection . - To determine relationship marker apoptosis tumor cell ( include MIF , CREB , HIF-1-alpha expression/polymorphism , others ) response therapy . - To define response rate patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 100 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Between 4-6 week completion initial therapy , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5-6 week . Beginning within 48 hour initiation radiotherapy , patient receive fluorouracil IV continuously completion radiotherapy . Patients also receive concurrent oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 15 29 bevacizumab IV day 1 15 . - Surgery : Four six week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo resection tumor . Patients evidence disease progression undergo successful surgical intervention ( i.e. , R0 resection ) proceed adjuvant chemotherapy within next 6-10 week . - Adjuvant therapy : Patients receive gemcitabine bevacizumab 4 course neoadjuvant therapy . Patients undergo collection tumor tissue sample time diagnosis , prior treatment endoscopic ultrasound laparoscopy , surgical resection follow neoadjuvant therapy . Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen obtain baseline analyzed immunohistochemistry assess tumor vascularity angiogenic activity . Tumor vascularity assess via immunostaining tumor specimens pan-endothelial cell marker , anti-CD34 , evaluation tumor blood vessel . Angiogenic activity assess analyze pERK1/2 , Ki67 , pericyte coverage index tumor specimen . Patients also undergo blood collection determine plasma level VEGF 4 week prior initial chemotherapy bevacizumab , 48 hour prior chemoradiotherapy bevacizumab , 48 hour prior adjuvant chemotherapy bevacizumab . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month first year , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
