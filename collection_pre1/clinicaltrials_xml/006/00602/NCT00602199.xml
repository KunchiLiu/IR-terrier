	<brief_title>ABT-510 Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Examine safety profile ABT-510 patient metastatic malignant melanoma . - Examine antitumor activity ( i.e. , time progression response rate ) patient treat ABT-510 . - Determine pharmacodynamic effect ABT-510 potential impact immune cell function patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive ABT-510 subcutaneously twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample obtain baseline , treatment day 1 cycle 2 3 , every course thereafter pharmacological ancillary study . Samples evaluate EC enumeration , expression profiling , circulate tumor cell quantification , analysis T-cell function ( i.e. , immunophenotyping NK- , T- B-cell phenotype well ELISPOT analysis common environmental pathogen T cell spectratyping ) , angiogenesis bioassay . Patients also undergo ultrasound-guided core tumor biopsy histological analysis microvascular density ( CD38 von Willebrand Factor immunohistochemistry ) baseline treatment day 1 course 3 5 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
