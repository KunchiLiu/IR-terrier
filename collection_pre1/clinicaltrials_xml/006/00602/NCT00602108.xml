	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving intraoperative radiation therapy lumpectomy follow external-beam radiation therapy may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well radiation therapy work treat woman undergo lumpectomy stage I stage IIA breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine feasibility acute patient tolerance intraoperative electron irradiation ( IOERT ) hypofractionated external-beam irradiation ( HYPORT ) lumpectomy patient stage I-IIA breast cancer treat breast conservation therapy . - To determine local tumor control distant tumor control rate patient stage I-IIA breast cancer treat breast conservation therapy use IOERT HYPORT lumpectomy . - To determine long-term side effect cosmetic outcome IOERT tumor bed HYPORT lumpectomy patient stage I-IIA breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo lumpectomy per standard procedure . Patients undergo intraoperative electron irradiation ( IOERT ) tumor bed right completion lumpectomy axillary lymph node dissection sentinel lymph node biopsy . Beginning 2-6 week lumpectomy axillary lymph node dissection/sentinel lymph node sample IOERT , patient receive hypofractionated external-beam irradiation daily 16 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter 8 year .</detailed_description>
