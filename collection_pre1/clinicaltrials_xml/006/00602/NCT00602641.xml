	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study melphalan prednisone thalidomide see well work compare melphalan prednisone together lenalidomide treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Thalidomide lenalidomide may stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . It yet know whether melphalan prednisone effective give together thalidomide lenalidomide treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan , Prednisone , Thalidomide Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival patient receive melphalan , prednisone , thalidomide versus melphalan , prednisone , lenalidomide newly diagnose multiple myeloma patient candidate high-dose therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival arm . II . To compare response rate depth response . III . To compare incidence toxicity . IV . To validate translocation ( TC ) classification myeloma prognostic tool use gene expression profile diagnosis . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare quality-of-life ( QOL ) change arm base Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity ( FACT-Ntx ) Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ) baseline end course 24 ( maintenance therapy ) . II . To examine impact differential treatment response , observe , QOL base FACT-Ntx TOI cycle 38 ( maintenance therapy ) . III . To obtain prospective data myeloma specific QOL attribute . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive melphalan orally ( PO ) prednisone PO daily ( QD ) day 1-4 , thalidomide PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive thalidomide PO QD continue absence disease progression . ARM II : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive melphalan PO prednisone PO QD day 1-4 , lenalidomide PO day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
