	<brief_summary>After surgery , patient cardiogram change consistent lack oxygen heart muscle , also know myocardial ischemia , find 9 time chance event heart attack subsequent 30 day . It known monitor treat ischemia prevent event heart attack . It known monitoring treatment do regular surgical ward . In pilot study , hope demonstrate study feasible , maintenance blind possible . The primary outcome show monitor surgery possible ≥ 95 % patient , show response treatment ischemia ≤ 1 hour possible ≥ 90 % patient , blind standard active treatment group possible 50 % ± 1 s.d.. With pilot study data , successful , apply peer-reviewed funding full study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Ischemia Reduction Study ( PROSE ) Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative myocardial ischemia study pre- , intra- , postoperative period . The intraoperative incidence similar preoperative period postoperative incidence double preoperative period . These result two implication : postoperative myocardial ischemia predict preoperative ambulatory ECG monitoring since half see preoperatively ; postoperative period significant myocardial ischemia occur . The role myocardial ischemia , especially prolonged ischemia , perioperative myocardial infarction ( PMI ) recognize number investigator . In presence postoperative myocardial ischemia , relative risk postoperative cardiac event 16 one study odds ratio ischemic cardiac event 9.2 another . Using 12-lead continuous monitoring , one study find PMI precede myocardial ischemia . Ambulatory ECG postoperative period well report past . Recently , Landesberg report sensitivity specificity lead placement detect myocardial ischemia postoperative period . Lead combination compare continuous 12-lead ECG 185 consecutive patient . Combining two precordial lead , sensitivity detect ischemia 97.4 % V3 + V5 ; 92.1 % V4 + V5 ; infarction 100 % V3 + V5 V4 + V5 . We believe pathogenesis PMI multifactorial . Apart coronary anatomy vulnerable plaque , stress hormone catecholamine surge perioperative period well report . Stress increase systolic BP , major determinant LV wall tension , hence , myocardial oxygen demand . The oxygen cost `` pressure work '' great `` volume work '' , area-under-the-curve LV pressure closely correlate myocardial oxygen demand . Hypercoagulable state also implicate PMI . With many possible pathogenesis , belief therefore postoperative myocardial ischemia may one final pathway postoperative ischemic cardiac complication . This especially PMI precede myocardial ischemia one study . With potentially multiple pathogenesis , unknown postoperative myocardial ischemia amenable treatment . It , however , belief postoperative myocardial ischemia abort use exist treatment modality . The implication reduction postoperative myocardial ischemia may reduce incidence postoperative ischemic cardiac complication , include PMI . Current standard care include telemetry real-time ST monitoring surgical patient . Traditional telemetry would impede low-risk patient postoperative recovery limit bed . In context real-time monitoring ST change low-risk patient , cost traditional telemetry nursing may also prohibitive . We propose novel technological application , transmit wireless ST segment monitoring alarm Blackberry . This alert research team verify via `` full disclosure '' ST monitor respond directly . SpaceLab , GlobeStar , Research Motion ( RIM ) develop hardware software respectively . We currently write assurance support SpaceLab , GlobeStar , RIM conduct pilot study novel application ( see attach ) . We therefore propose pilot study determine feasibility wireless ST-segment monitoring treatment post-surgical patient .</detailed_description>
