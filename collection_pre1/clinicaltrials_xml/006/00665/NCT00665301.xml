	<criteria>Adults Only : The FloWave device intend use adult patient . All subject 18 year old . Existing placement Pulmonary Arterial Catheter place medical reason study . Patients aortic balloon pump cardiac mechanical assist device exclude study enrollment device present screen process . If patient cardiac assist device insert enrollment study , cardiac output data collect PAC FloWave device evaluate subset analysis population conclusion study . Patients intracardiac shunt exclude study . FloWave cardiac output determination dependent detection pulse . If peripheral pulse detect device able perform measurement indicate user . Patients steady hemodynamic state shall exclude study . Presence arrhythmia : Patients arrhythmias exclude study steady hemodynamic state . If patient history arrhythmia currently experience arrhythmia maintain hemodynamic state , exclude enrollment study . Their clinical symptom cardiac rhythm evaluate noted patient data record . Inability unwillingness subject subject 's legally authorize representative give inform consent .</criteria>
