	<brief_summary>Background : This study use new experimental procedure treat melanoma us patient 's lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) , specially select target destroy tumor . Objectives : To determine whether experimental treatment cause patient 's tumor shrink . To test safety treatment effect immune system . Eligibility : Patients metastatic melanoma 18 year age old standard treatment effective take high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Patients must tissue type human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) 0201 . Design : Workup : Patients scan , x-ray , laboratory test , test need . Patients leukapheresis ( procedure collect lymphocyte similar collect whole blood ) collect cell laboratory treatment later reinfusion . Chemotherapy : Patients low-dose chemotherapy 1 week prepare immune system receive culture lymphocyte . Cell infusion IL-2 treatment : Patients receive lymphocyte infusion vein either high-dose IL-2 infused vein low-dose IL-2 injected skin . High-dose IL-2 give infusion vein every 8 hour 15 dos . Low-dose IL-2 give injection skin daily 5 day , follow 2-day rest , regimen repeat total 5 week . Recovery : Patients rest 1 2 week recover effect chemotherapy IL-2 . Tumor biopsy : Patients may ask biopsy ( removal small piece tumor ) receive treatment look effect treatment tumor . Follow-up : After treatment complete , patient return clinic physical examination , review side effect , laboratory test scan every 1 6 month disease worsen . Retreatment : Patients whose tumor grow treatment show evidence shrinking may able retreated tumor begin grow . They receive regimen chemotherapy , lymphocyte infusion IL-2 treatment ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) transfer study patient metastatic melanoma follow lymphodepletion result 50 % objective response rate 10-15 % rate complete response . - Pre-clinical clinical study adoptive immunotherapy suggest effective lymphocyte transfer high avidity target antigen , undergo limited vitro antigen IL-2 stimulation , high expression cluster differentiation 27+ ( CD27+ ) . - We develop novel vitro strategy use high throughput polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) screen rapidly isolate low frequency antigen specific cluster differentiation 8+ ( CD8+ ) T cell peripheral blood repertoire characteristic , recognize gp100:154-162 epitope , abundantly express melanoma antigen , present human leukocyte antigen ( HLAA2 ) tumor surface . - The current propose transfer gp100:154-162 reactive lymphocyte administer conjunction lymphodepleting preparative regimen aldesleukin would represent significantly novel approach adoptive immunotherapy . Objectives : - To determine whether gp100:154-162 reactive cluster differentiation 4+ ( CD4+ ) T cell deplete lymphocyte infused conjunction administration high-dose aldesleukin low-dose aldesleukin may result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma receive non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . - To evaluate safety treatment patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , cell transfer , high-dose low-dose aldesleukin . - To determine survival patient , infused cell follow administration non-myeloablative regimen , use analysis sequence variable region T cell receptor flow cytometry ( fluorescence activate cell sorting-FACS ) . Eligibility : -Patients refractory metastatic melanoma great equal 18 year age , HLA-A2+ , gp100:154-162 reactive peripheral blood lymphocyte available physically able tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy . Patients must refractory prior high dose aldesleukin treatment medically eligible receive . Patients tolerate high-dose aldesleukin receive cell infusion ; tolerate high-dose receive low-dose aldesleukin . Design : - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day X 2 day intravenous ( IV ) ) , fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV X 5 day ) . - Patients receive intravenous adoptive transfer gp100:154-162 reactive peripheral blood lymphocyte ( minimum 1 X 10^9 ) maximum 3 X 10^11 ) lymphocyte ) follow high-dose intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hour 15 dos ) low-dose subcutaneous ( SQ ) aldesleukin ( 125,000 IU IL-2/kg/dose 5 day 6 week 2 day rest per week ) . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 4-6 week last dose aldesleukin high dose arm 2-4 week last dose aldesleukin low dose arm . Patients enrol two cohort . The cohort receive high dose aldesleukin conduct use small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 21 patient enrol , two first 21 patient clinical response ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) , accrual continue 41 patient , target 20 % goal objective response . For cohort receive low dose aldesleukin , study conduct Minimax two-stage phase II trial . Initially 12 evaluable patient enrol cohort , 1 first 12 response , accrual would continue total 21 patient , target 20 % goal objective response .</detailed_description>
