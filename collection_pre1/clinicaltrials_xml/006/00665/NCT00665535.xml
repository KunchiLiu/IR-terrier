	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine optimal frequency reposition nursing facility resident limited mobility care high density foam mattress order prevent bed sore . It hypothesize participant moderate risk ( Braden Scale Scores 13-14 ) turn every 3 4 hour participant high risk ( Braden Scores 10-12 ) turn every 3 4 hour high incidence ulcer resident turn every 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose multi-site , randomize , control trial determine optimal frequency reposition nursing facility resident mobility limitation moderate high risk pressure ulcer development care high density foam mattress purpose prevent pressure ulcer . Pressure ulcer result primarily pressure bony prominence occludes blood flow tissue . Traditionally , soft surface mattress reposition individual every 2 hour relieve pressure gold standard care prevent ulcer . Recent improvement support surface may reduce need 2-hour repositioning . The specific aim study determine : 1 ) significant difference incidence pressure ulcer among : ) moderate risk ( Braden Scale Score , 13-14 ) resident randomly assign reposition every 2- , compare every 3- 4- hour ; b ) high risk ( Braden Scale Score , 10-12 ) resident turn every 2- compare every 3- 4-hours ; 2 ) mobility ( spontaneous assist ) measure actigraphy significant covariate repositioning frequency incidence pressure ulcer 3 ) resident characteristic resident influence factor significant covariates reposition schedule pressure ulcer incidence . A 2 X 2/2 X 3 experimental design use participant two level risk ( moderate high ) pressure ulcer development randomly assign one 3 repositioning schedule every 2-hours ( current standard care ) , contrast 3- 4- hour carry 3 week . Actigraphs wear 7 day ( Tuesday Tuesday ) determine mobility significant covariate . Residents ( 1080 ) 65 year , able give consent surrogate give consent moderate high risk pressure ulcer invite participate . Nursing facility select ability follow research protocol submit data accord protocol requirement , reputation good care select participation . Participants randomly assign reposition schedule carry Certified Nursing Assistants ( CNA ) document time reposition . A CNA supervisor monitor reposition documentation frequently . Data FAXED monitor investigator daily . With exception reposition intervention , participant receive preventive care resident . The primary outcome study , pressure ulcer ( yes/no ) document nurse assessor mask reposition timing . Data analysis management perform ISIS . The goal study shape Nursing Facility policy define level risk , mobility , frequency reposition resident reduce incidence pressure ulcer improve resident outcome . Less frequent repositioning would allow resident long period sleep , would reduce staff time repositioning , allow efficient allocation time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants : Be free pressure ulcer upon admission study . Have Braden Scale Score 10 12 ( high risk ) 13 14 ( moderate risk ) within one week admission ( new resident ) great 90 day ( establish resident ) study participation Have highdensity foam replacement mattress use transfer mattress . Are 65 year old . Younger resident present few number may different health issue comorbidities old resident . Can legally grant consent participate available surrogate grant consent . If able , participant assent surrogate grant consent . Expected length stay 21 day great . Pressure ulcer present upon initial examination . The Braden Scale score 15 great indicate mild risk risk , 9 indicate high risk . The resident turn 3 anatomical surface ( side , back , side ) contraindication repositioning .</criteria>
