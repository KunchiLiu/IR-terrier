	<brief_summary>Background : Infertility affect 15 % married couple . About half attributable female factor , among anovulation lead cause . Some 5 % woman reproductive age anovulatory due polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . PCOS cause also major health cosmetic problem significantly affect quality life . PCOS associate cardiovascular morbidity Type 2 diabetes mellitus , unclear whether caused ovarian dysfunction result common denominator . Working hypothesis aim : Whole genome analysis multigenerational family least one woman affect PCOS may significantly reduce number need verify specific gene , involve causation PCOS . Methods : Registration multigenerational family production personal file full workup presence PCOS absence ( woman participant ) . Drawing blood , extraction preservation DNA . Analysis informative SNPs genome participant specific microarray chip . Statistical analysis result . Expected result : Verification loci putative gene , associate appearance PCOS . Importance : Elucidation specific gene underlie pathology PCOS . Probable implication Medicine : Paving way target treatment problem , associate PCOS , base clear knowledge underlie cause ( ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Working Hypothesis The recent trend GWA comparison large number DNA sample affect individual large pool unrelated individual ( Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium ) . Whenever control group come family member , number patient need sample consistently small ( Dempfle et al 2006 ; The Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-Pair Linkage Group 2005 ) , due less degree freedom statistical analysis ( Chen WM &amp; Abecasis GR 2007 ) . 2 . Specific Aims 1 . What specific informative SNPs , associate PCOD ? 2 . What specific gene locate vicinity SNPs , could contribute development clinical syndrome ? Detailed description propose research Clinical data collection patient recruitment Patients Women diagnose suffer PCOD base Rotterdam criterion ( ) : 1 . Oligo- and/or anovulation 2 . Clinical and/or biochemical sign hyperandrogenism 3 . Polycystic ovary , exclusion aetiology ( congenital adrenal hyperplasia , androgen-secreting tumour , Cushing 's syndrome ) Routine test serum level relevant sex hormone perform 3rd day menstrual cycle . Glucose insulin level measure fast state . The individual data collection page present Appendix 1 . Controls Sisters , mother , father , aunt grandmother affect woman ask disclose relevant clinical history donate single blood test DNA extraction hormonal test , take 3rd day menstruation , applicable . The population serve Mayanei Hayeshua hospital characterize short generation interval , due mean early age marriage desire bear child right marriage . This allow formation genealogy tree informative . Data security term use sample Recruitment family member index case , participant receive complete explanation possible personal implication study result family ( none ) . Overall , included woman , patient family member alike , notify secrecy data use declare purpose research . They also make aware personal benefit harm derive data . In addition , participant inform future arise new reason re-analyze sample , specific address make every one obtain new permission use . Upon request participant receive full explanation storage system hierarchy responsibility sample data security . 3 . Compliance definition feasibility study The fund request herein meant enable formation DNA bank family tree , turn serve basis application receive full funding whole genome analysis , large funding resource . Towards team future participant worldwide consortium topic ( letter intention Bart Fauser , lead person consortium , attach ) . Our pronounced advantage within consortium , availability multigenerational family , member treat Bnei Brak . 4 . Potential Implications Medicine contribution expect outcome society Paving way target treatment problem , associate PCOS , base clear knowledge underlie cause ( ) .</detailed_description>
