	<brief_summary>Parkinson disease degenerative neurologic condition characterize slowness movement , tremor , loss balance control . It result significant degree disability affect individual . Exercise medication management two treatment frequently use treat Parkinson disease , although individual benefit treatment , effect exercise work presently know . We examine muscle structure movement control responses strengthen exercise compare therapeutic response observe result medication intake . This process allow u good understand mechanism underlie therapeutic effect strengthen exercise person Parkinson disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Parkinson disease ( IPD ) model movement disorder explore motor function basal ganglion . ( Morris ME , 2005 ) Alterations output basal ganglia lead reduction muscle force output movement amplitude inactivity impaired mobility contribute loss muscle size strength . Collectively factor lead reduction size speed ( hypokinesia ) functional movement gait . Hypokinesia gait initiation gait biomechanical event precipitate movement deficit bradykinesia fall . Previous study suggest resistance training beneficial management person PD . Although anatomic , behavioral , mobility related improvement demonstrate resistance training intervention , unclear observe change derive solely peripheral musculoskeletal change central nervous system mediate alteration force output movement amplitude . The responsiveness muscle force , movement amplitude , hypokinesia CNS mediate effect dopamine replacement provide model system effect resistance training compare . In order examine question , plan conduct control trial rigorously examine effect high force resistance training muscle structure , muscle force output , hypokinesia person moderate IPD process , characterize potentially differential effect resistance training effect dopamine replacement . This study assemble team investigator experience high force resistance training , measurement biomechanical clinical balance function person PD , statistical analysis expertise . Persons IPD recruit , examine , meet inclusion criterion randomly assign one two group ( experimental standard care control ) . A battery test include muscle structure , muscle force production , measure hypokinesia assess dopamine replacement medication prior 12 week resistance training intervention . The first specific aim study determine high force resistance training result improvement muscle structure , muscle force output , hypokinesia person moderate IPD . The second specific aim characterize compare differential effect high force resistance training dopamine replacement muscle force output hypokinesia person moderate IPD . We hypothesize dopamine replacement resistance training interact improve muscle force output reduce hypokinesia . In addition , hypothesize examination kinematic pattern gait initiation reveal differential effect low extremity hypokinesia . The result study help good understand differential contribution resistance training dopamine replacement hypokinesia person PD .</detailed_description>
