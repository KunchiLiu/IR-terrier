	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The grow use totally implantable venous access device ( TIVAD ) cause simultaneous increase various complication . The infection TIVAD subcutaneous pocket device position one encountered complication . The aim study evaluate role antibiotic prevention infection surgical site TIVAD 30 day implant . METHODS : The author enrol one hundred consecutive patient divide two randomized arm : group A ( antibiotic ) , group B ( antibiotic ) , 50 patient . All patient affect solid tumor need chemotherapy continuously . TIVADs implant surgically cephalic vein . Signs symptom consider : pain , localize swelling , redness , heat . White cell count consider first , third , seventh postoperative day , test make in-hospital laboratory . Body temperatures checked twice daily 7 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic Therapy Not Necessary Implant Totally Implantable Venous Access Devices : Randomized Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred consecutive patient enrol present study January 2004 September 2006 . The patient divide two arm , 50 patient , randomize use sealed envelope open operate room 30 min start procedure . All patient age 18 year affect solid tumor . In patient , TIVAD necessary infuse chemotherapy continuously . The type device utilize patient composed catheter polyurethane titanium portal reservoir cover polysulfone ( PORT-A-CATH , Smiths Medical Inc. , MN ) . Age , gender , comorbidity ( cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , coagulopathy , diabetes ) , white cell , platelet , prothrombin time ( le 70 % ) , kind tumoral disease , number chemotherapeutical cure surgical procedure , experience surgeon ( resident surgeon ) , preparation skin patient , time kind hand scrub surgeon , kind antibiotic use , time administration consider present study . All device implant operating room use cephalic vein dissect surgically ; technique use previously described.3 White cell count consider first , third , seventh postoperative day , test make in-hospital laboratory . Body temperatures checked twice daily 7 day . Eight day surgical procedure , suture skin remove . The skin wound cover sterile drape ninth postoperative day . After time , patient use skin protection , skin wound check one time week total 30 day . All device use infuse chemotherapy drug 10 day surgical procedure . From 10th 30th day , device use , minimum , one time . A single dose cephalosporin ( 1 gr amoxicillin clavulanic acid ) administer intravenously 10 min skin incision . For surgical site infection ( SSI ) , criteria Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , Atlanta , Georgia,9 apply . By criterion , SSIs classify either incisional organ/space . Incisional SSIs divide involve skin subcutaneous tissue ( superficial incisional SSI ) involve deep soft tissue incision ( deep incisional SSI ) . Organ/space SSIs involve part anatomy ( e.g. , organ space ) incise body wall layer open manipulated operation ( Fig . 1 ) . The following sign symptom define superficial incisional infection consider : pain , localize swelling , redness , heat.9 Infection consider sign symptom occur within 30 day surgical procedure , end point consider body temperature 37.5°C , white cell 11,000 K/æL , one follow sign : pain , localize swelling , redness , heat . The state skin evaluate people surgical team , compose surgeon ( one skilled , 400 previous procedure , one resident , 20 previous procedure ) two nurse . Following rule , depend result computer-generated randomization enclose sealed envelope , 100 patient divide two group 50 patient : group A ( patient submit short-term prophylaxis cefalosporin 10 min skin incision ) group B ( patient without antibiotic prophylaxis ) . All patient hospitalize night surgical procedure . A statistical study , compare mean standard deviation group , perform use Student 's t-test ( independent , two-sided ) .</detailed_description>
