	<brief_summary>Some patient multiple myeloma lymphoma need treatment high dose chemotherapy treat condition . This potent treatment kill many blood-forming cell bone marrow . The patient therefore need blood-forming cell replace chemotherapy treatment . This do collecting teh patient blood-forming stem cell chemotherapy , store infuse patient chemotherapy ( way blood transfusion give ) . The stem cell make way unto bone marrow re-populate . Having stem cell collect return later call `` Autologous Transplant '' . In patient blood-forming stem cell ( normally live bone marrow ) `` mobilize '' blood stream collect process call apheresis ( bit like donate blood ) . This process mobilization always successful . In study patient collect enough stem cell previous cell collection attempt autologous stem cell transplant participate . Patients mobilize G-CSF ( current standard treatment mobilize stem cell ) effect add AMD3100 G-CSF study compare outcome patient get G-CDF placebo ( non-active substance look like AMD3100 ) patient get G-CSF AMD3100 . AMD3100 member new class medication call `` chemokine inhibitor '' . The drug trigger movement stem cell bone marrow blood stream . In previous study healthy volunteer cancer patient , AMD3100 G-CSF use combination , great number stem cell mobilize blood stream use g-CSF alone . The purpose study measure many stem cell collect , number day collect cell safety mobilization regimen AMD3100 G-CSF compare G-CSF placebo . If enough cell collect transplant , study also evaluate well cell grow transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Addition AMD3100 G-CSF Mobilization Regimen Patients With Lymphoma ( NHL HD ) Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , comparative , patient-blinded study . Patients NHL , HD MM would benefit autologous stem cell transplant , fail previous collection collection attempt mobilization regimen chemotherapy wihoutG-CSF , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible receive AMD3100 ( 240µg/kg ) placebo ( give even dose ) . Patients undergo mobilization G-CSF ( 10µg/kg ) 4 consecutive day . On Day 4 , AMD3100 ( 240µg/kg ) placebo administer even prior first apheresis subsequent even prior apheresis thereafter , 10 11 hour interval dose initiation apheresis . Patients continue receive G-CSF day apheresis . G-CSF administer morning approximately 1 hour prior apheresis . Patients undergo minimum 2 maximum 7 aphereses minimum 2x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg great equal 5x10^6 CD34+cells/kg collect . More cell may collect , do within 7 aphereses . Patients receive tandem transplant undergo minimum 2 maximum 7 aphereses minimum 4x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg collect . Aphereses perform consecutive day ( include weekend day ) The patient peripheral blood ( PB ) sample collect measure number CD34+ cell PB baseline prior administration G-CSF , prior administration AMD3100 placebo initiation apheresis . In addition , sample obtain apheresis product measure number CD34+ cell collect apheresis product . Patients fail collect great equal 0.8x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 7 aphereses offer rescue arm give AMD3100 plus G-CSF . Patients undergo ablative chemotherapy transplantation . Patients transplant . The success transplantation evaluate . Graft durability evaluate 12 month post-transplant . In event sufficient number cell transplantation obtain collection , cell may retain , pool , transplant later date Investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible undergo autologous transplantation . Diagnosis NHL , HD MM [ patient plasma cell leukemia leukemia include chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , exclude ] . In last collection attempt prior entry trial , patient fail collect 0.8x10^6 cells/kg least 2 apheresis session 2x10^6 cells/kg 4 apheresis session use mobilization regimen chemotherapy , without GCSF . A minimum 7 day interval last collection attempt randomization . Cardiac , pulmonary renal function deem clinically adequate able undergo mobilization transplant . Performance status , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 ≥ 21 day last cycle chemotherapy randomization ( thalidomide , dexamethasone , corticosteroid , Rituxan® Velcade® consider prior chemotherapy purpose study ) . The patient recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy . WBC ≥ 2.5x10^9/l . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5x10^9/l . Platelet count ≥ 75x10^9/l . Adequate renal function demonstrate serum creatine ≤ equal 2.2 mg/dl creatinine clearance ( 24 hr urine collection ) ≥ 60 ml/min Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase ( SGOT ) , Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase ( SGPT ) total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Signed informed consent . All patient must agree use highly effective method contraception ( include female patient childbearing potential male patient childbearing potential partner ) . Effective birth control include : ) birth control pill , depoprogesterone , IUD PLUS one barrier method , b ) two barrier method . Effective barrier method : male female condom , diaphragm , spermicide ( creams gel contain chemical kill sperm ) . For patient use hormonal contraceptive method , information interaction MAD3100 hormonal contraceptive know . A comorbid condition , view Investigators , render patient high risk treatment complication . A residual acute medical condition result prior chemotherapy . Received thalidomide , dexamethasone corticosteroid , Rituxan® Velcade® within 7 day prior randomization . Brain metastases carcinomatous meningitis . Active acute chronic infection antiinfective therapy within 1 week prior randomization . Fever ( temperature ≥ 38 degree celsius ) . Hypercalcemia ( ≥ 1mg/dl ULN ) . Known HIVpositive . Pregnant nursing female . Patient unwilling implement adequate birth control ( include female patient childbearing potential male patient childbearing potential partner ) . Patients previously receive experimental therapy within 4 week randomization currently enrol another experimental protocol Mobilization phase . Patients fail previous collection attempt within 7 day less randomization .</criteria>
