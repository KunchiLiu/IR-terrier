	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance common people coinfected HIV Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) associate poor response treatment HCV . Pioglitazone FDA-approved medication treatment type 2 diabetes . It work increase body 's sensitivity insulin . The purpose study determine whether treatment pioglitazone prior HCV treatment peginterferon ribavirin safe effective improve treatment outcome insulin-resistant , HIV/HCV-coinfected people previous treatment peginterferon ribavirin unsuccessful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Before Peginterferon Ribavirin Hepatitis C Infection HIV/HCV-Coinfected Patients With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New good strategy treatment HCV HIV/HCV-coinfected people urgently need . Standard therapy HCV include treatment peginterferon plus ribavirin . Peginterferon modify form drug interferon use either alone combination ribavirin treatment HCV . Ribavirin work stop HCV multiply inside body . Sustained virologic response rate past large study peginterferon plus ribavirin use treat HCV type 1 4 range 11 % 29 % . Studies show insulin resistance HCV-infected people HIV uninfected lead poor HCV treatment response . Improving body 's response insulin may also improve outcome treatment HCV . Participants study take pioglitazone alone 28 week . At Entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12,18 , 24 participant receive clinical assessment . At Week 24 , participant undergo additional test ensure enter Step 2 study . Participants able continue take peginterferon ribavirin addition pioglitazone 48 additional week . Clinical assessment take place time entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 Step 2 . Participants exhibit response treatment Weeks 12 24 continue Step 2 , unlikely treatment elicit response . Participants continue study return study site clinical assessment Weeks 32 , 40 , 48 Step 2 . Follow-up visit hold Weeks 60 72 . The assessment do clinic visit may include follow test : thyroid function , hematology chemistry , fast plasma glucose , liver function , gamma-glutamyl transferase , pregnancy , CD4/CD8 , HIV-1 RNA , qualitative HCV RNA , quantitative HCV RNA . On November 18 , 2011 study close accrual due meeting target accrual goal .</detailed_description>
