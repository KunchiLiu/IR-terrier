	<brief_summary>1 . CPAP compliance significantly higher heated humidity Thermosmart™ nasal steroid phase compare double placebo phase . 2 . CPAP compliance comparably improve heat humidity Thermosmart™ phase versus nasal steroid phase . 3 . Improvement nasal symptom use CPAP significantly improve heated humidity Thermosmart™ nasal steroid phase compare double placebo phase , comparable heat humidity Thermosmart™ phase versus nasal steroid phase . 4 . Secondary improvement CPAP compliance , measure daytime function quality life improve heat humidity Thermosmart™ versus double placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Heated Humidity With Thermosmart™ Compared Intranasal Steroid Improving Compliance Nasal Symptoms Patients Using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participant undergo double-blind , placebo control , single-blind double placebo run-in , crossover trial determine efficacy heat humidity Thermosmart™ improve compliance nasal symptom patient use CPAP versus nasal steroid placebo ( heat humidity , nasal steroid placebo ) phase . After successful screening , participant undergo two week single-blind double placebo run-in phase use heat humidity nasal steroid placebo . The double-blind treatment phase last total six week . Participants undergo phase : three week use heated humidity Thermosmart™ nasal steroid placebo three week use nasal steroid heat humidifier . Treatment phase counterbalance . Study participation last total 8 week screen completion double-blind treatment .</detailed_description>

CPAP compliance past three week screen &gt; 5 hours/night , suggest compromise CPAP usage due adverse nasal symptom Wake rest SaO2 &lt; 90 % Currently use BiLevel therapy , supplemental oxygen CPAP therapy , use pressure outside inclusion criterion Currently use FullFace mask CPAP therapy Current prior use Fisher Paykel 604 CPAP machine Thermosmart™ heat humidity . Patients never prescribe heat humidifier CPAP machine ( i.e . humidifier passover humidifier ) . Intranasal steroid treatment within previous six month . Patient 's currently take intranasal steroid treatment washout steroid treatment include patient use nasal steroid treatment CPAP therapy Current upper airway tract infection , influenza , respiratory infection time screen nasal surgery within 90 day screen Prior surgical intervention obstructive sleep apnea Currently take medication would contraindicate use nasal steroid . Patients take hypnotic wake promote therapy participate stable dose prior CPAP therapy willing maintain current dose prescribed . Shift rotate shift worker individual routinely contribute least 6 hours/night sleep/attempting therapy Additional sleep disorder would interfere routine use CPAP</criteria>
