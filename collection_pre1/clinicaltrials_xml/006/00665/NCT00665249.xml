	<detailed_description>Motivational interviewing ( MI ) demonstrate effective intervention alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . The consistency , magnitude , durability effect suggest powerful mechanisms behavior change ( MOBC ) operate reduce drinking . A good understanding MOBC MI therefore important . Existing MOBC study MI yield limited contradictory finding . The project propose conduct small pilot study disaggregate MI component part test full MI compare MI without directive strategy . This test compare whether directive element MI ( Full MI , FMI ) critical whether MI effect may attributable solely Rogerian , non-directive component ( aka , Spirit-Only MI , SOMI ) .

Further , examine whether non-specific therapy factor alone ( SOMI ) significantly reduce drinking compare Feedback Followed Counseling ( FFC ) condition control non-therapy factor incorporate assessment self-monitoring . We also test whether SOMI 's main effect mediate increase mood great belief ability change , hypothesize various theory . Our work MOBC MI take place context study brief , stand-alone treatment individual primary AUD seek reduce , stop , drink . We recruit 90 individual AUD seek treatment ; collect daily process data pre-treatment week ; ass randomly assign 3 condition : FMI , SOMI , FFC . All participant follow 9 week use daily Interactive Voice Recording ( IVR ) in-laboratory assessment week 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 . Those treatment condition receive 4 session treatment week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 . FFC receive treatment complete week 8 assessment period . Participants FMI SOMI follow additional 4 week post-treatment ( week 12 ) .</detailed_description>
