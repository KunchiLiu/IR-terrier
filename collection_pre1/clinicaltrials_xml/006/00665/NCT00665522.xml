	<brief_title>A Prospective Safety Surveillance Study Fentanyl Iontophoretic Transdermal System ( 40 Mcg )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system evaluate number research study . Although research include patient acute moderate severe pain particular type surgery , include abdominal , pelvic , orthopedic procedure , safety associate use condition routine post-operative clinical care may completely characterize study database . This study surveillance study risk associate usage fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system condition . Approximately 3,000 patient schedule surgery need treatment acute moderate severe post-operative pain treat fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system hospital setting evaluate . In addition , group approximately 1,500 patient treat opioid intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( IV PCA ) match fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system patient respect ( 1 ) country ( match first seek within research center , extend patient country match find ) , ( 2 ) pre-surgical physical condition ( 3 ) surgery risk ( high risk versus low risk ) . Patients multiple research center multiple country include . Patients plan surgery anticipate use opioid pain management post-operative care candidate treatment fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system IV PCA opioid treatment study explain may participate give informed consent meet study entry criterion . Enrollment study begin prior surgical procedure . Patients receive treatment care accord standard practice study center , include : treatment choice , pain management set-up , operation . Data collection observational ( non-interventional ) study begin inform consent obtain admission study center surgical procedure continue discontinuation fentanyl HCl 40 mcg system IV PCA opioid treatment . Any significant change medical condition follow resolve become medically stable . Patients receive fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system 40 mcg ( fentanyl HCl 40 mcg deliver patient activation 10 minute maximum 6 doses/hour 24 hr 80 total dos ) Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( IV PCA ) opioid ( medication choice , treatment regimen , operation PCA pump consistent standard practice participate center ) . Treatment duration determine treat physician .</detailed_description>
