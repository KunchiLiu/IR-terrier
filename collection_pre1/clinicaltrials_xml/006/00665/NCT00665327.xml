	<criteria>Presence radiological evidence new progressive infiltrate ( ) consistent bacterial pneumonia least 2 follow : Productive cough purulent mucopurulent sputum/tracheobronchial secretion change character sputum ( increased volume purulence ) Dyspnea tachypnea Rigors chill Pleuritic chest pain Auscultatory finding pulmonary examination rales/crackles and/or evidence pulmonary consolidation Fever hypothermia White blood cell count &gt; /= 10000/mm3 &gt; /= 15 % immature neutrophil , regardless peripheral WBC count , leukopenia total WBC count &lt; 4500/mm3 Known hypersensitivity fluoroquinolones Presence endorgan damage shock need vasopressor &gt; 4 hour time study entry Need mechanical ventilation study entry Implanted cardiac defibrillator . Significant bradycardia heart rate &lt; 50 beats/minute . Hospitalized &gt; 48 hour develop pneumonia . Systemic antibacterial therapy 24 hour within 7 day enrollment unless patient deem treatment failure receive great 72 hour nonfluoroquinolone antibiotic . Coexistent disease consider likely affect outcome study ( e.g . active lung cancer , connective tissue disease affect lung , bronchiectasis ) . Mechanical endobronchial obstruction ( e.g . endobronchial tumor ) . Known suspect active tuberculosis endemic fungal infection Neutropenia ( neutrophil count &lt; 1000/Microliter ) . Chronic treatment ( equal longer 2 week ) know immunosuppressant therapy ( include treatment &gt; 15 mg/day systemic prednisone equivalent ) . Patient known HIV infection CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 . Known severe hepatic insufficiency . Renal impairment baseline measure calculate serum creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min . If recent value 24 hour creatinine clearance available creatinine clearance calculate use CockcroftGault formula . Known prolongation QT interval use Class IA Class III antiarrhythmic ( e.g. , quinidine , procainamide , amiodarone , sotalol ) . Uncorrected hypokalemia . Previous history tendinopathy quinolones . Previously enter study . Participated clinical investigational drug study within 4 week screen . Known suspected concomitant bacterial infection require additional systemic antibacterial treatment . Patients history hypersensitivity reaction multivitamin infusion ( MVI ) preexist hypervitaminosis .</criteria>
