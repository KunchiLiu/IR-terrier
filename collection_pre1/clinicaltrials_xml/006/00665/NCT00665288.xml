	<detailed_description>Background : Overall survival rate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rarely exceed 5 % . While bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) increase survival cardiac arrest victim four time , bystander CPR rate remain low Canada ( 15 % ) . Survivors quality life similar general population . Most cardiac arrest victim men sixty ; usually collapse home ( 85 % ) , bystander CPR rate even low . The event witness family member bystander 50 % time . These statistic appear support strategy target CPR train old population likely witness cardiac arrest event . Interest CPR train appear decrease advance age . Behaviour surround CPR training performance never study use theoretical construct well validated behavioural theory ( Theory Planned Behaviour ) . Objectives : The overall goal study conduct survey well understand behavioural factor associate successful CPR knowledge transfer independent-living old population ( age 55 ) . Specific objective : 1 ) To conduct semi-structured qualitative interview identify factor influence CPR training performance behaviour ; 2 ) To develop survey instrument factor influence CPR training performance behaviour base systematic review literature , result semi-structured interview , theoretical construct ; 3 ) To conduct telephone survey among independent-living population age 55 use survey instrument , identify factor strategy might target KT intervention . Methods : Objective 1 : We tape-record semi-structured qualitative interview conduct among 20 randomly select participant age 55 old , perform inductive analysis identify category theme . Objective 2 : The survey instrument develop base complete systematic review literature , result objective 1 . The two behaviour study �seeking CPR train provide CPR cardiac arrest victim� . Objective 3 : We develop conduct nation-wide telephone survey use random digit dialling . The telephone survey centrally administer stratified province large small community order obtain representative random sample Canadian population . The study population include men woman age 55 old , live independently community , ability communicate English French . We seek obtain participation rate 60 % great . We estimate require approximately 500 respondent identify factor strategy improve CPR KT target population . Analyses include measure sample bias , reliability measure , construct validity , well multiple regression analysis identify construct beliefs salient seniors� decision whether attend CPR class perform CPR .</detailed_description>
