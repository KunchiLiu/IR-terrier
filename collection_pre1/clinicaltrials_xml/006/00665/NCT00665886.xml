	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate , prospective randomize fashion , clinical performance close intravenous system versus open conventional one , respect ease handle effectiveness ( defined time survival without complication ) , security provide professional patient accidental blood exposure needlestick injury , catheter-related complication phlebitis , pain blockage overall cost two system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compact Closed System Versus Mounted Open System ( COSMOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study prospective , open , randomize , unblinded , group-sequential design . Study initiation proceed program education train nurse participant ensure proper handle system standard insertion maintenance technique catheter system . This standardization include disinfection skin access port well fixation catheter use standard transparent dressing . Also train give best practice procedure remove catheter , sterile technique culture catheter tip proper data capture method use Clinical Report Form ( CRF ) . All nurse participate study certify attendance training , acceptance present protocol voluntary participation signing Participant Registry conclusion training . They must give full names well personnel unit number , use constitute Investigating Group well protect identity provide traceable record participants.They must pass training examination consist 10 question relate study pass mark least 80 % question correct . The study preform three medical surgical unit University Clinical Hospital San Carlos Madrid , affiliate Madrid Health Service , integral part Autonomous Region ( Community ) Madrid.Trainings activity relate study begin formal approval protocol Ethics Committee ( abbreviate CEIC Spanish ) hospital . In order reduce variability study , catheter insert use 70 % alcohol disinfection skin access port . Following manufacturer recommendation , three-way tap ( USA , 'stop cock ' ) extension tube change every 72 hour split-septum connector change every 8 day . In order calculate colonization rate catheter system correlation colonization clinical complication , tip culture take representative sample catheter arm . This process randomize coincide catheter withdrawal . Additionally catheter remove pain , phlebitis suspect infection tip culture . Our sample size target culture tip 380 total . During study , six nurse-coordinators , experience intravenous therapy special training study procedure , actively supervise aspect catheter management report Principal Investigator ( PI ) regular basis . They ensure randomization process followed procedure establish Protocol , well correct fill CRF , rigorously adhere . In order accomplish make daily inspection catheter include study , check item CRF daily ensure properly promptly fill follow catheter tip culture certify result register CRFs . The coordinator otherwise intervene patient care . Any decision relate place remove peripheral catheter cause , decision care maintenance catheter system , treatment decision related patient sole responsibility doctor nurse care patient . Nurse-coordinators and/or PI intrude way decision . An intermediate analysis do unit reach 166 catheter insert . This analysis allow u confirm power calculation study determine final sample size target . All patient admit one three participate unit , need peripheral venous catheter gauge size18 G , 20 G 22 G , evaluate potential inclusion study . Using CRF determination eligibility make study purpose requirement explain layman 's term patient primary nurse . If accept study patient inform consent obtain . Informed consent may verbal condition witness one relative document CRF . After patient randomized experimental group ( closed system ) control ( open system ) .</detailed_description>
