	<detailed_description>Phase I Study Bevacizumab Sorafenib Combined Low Dose Cyclophosphamide Patients Refractory Solid Tumors Leukemia . Patients solid tumor ( include central nervous tumor ) recurrent refractory standard therapy , standard therapy available . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , tolerability dose test maximum 6 patient , cohort 3 , refractory recurrent leukemia maximum 24 evaluable patient , cohort 6 , refractory recurrent solid tumor . Approximately 21-24 patient refractory solid tumor define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 6 patient recurrent refractory leukemia,12 patient refractory recurrent bone soft tissue sarcomas 12 patient refractory recurrent solid tumor ( include lymphoma ) test tolerability MTD patient hematological malignancy . Bevacizumab administer intravenously start dose 5 mg/kg every 3 week sorafenib mouth every 12 hr start dose 90 mg/m2 every 12 hour cyclophosphamide mouth daily dose 50 mg/m2/day ( dose level 1 ) . A course therapy consider 21 day duration . Once maximum tolerate dose sorafenib ( sMTD ) combination bevacizumab cyclophosphamide determine , 6 patient recurrent refractory leukemia evaluate solid tumor MTD test tolerability combination patient hematological malignancy .</detailed_description>
