	<brief_summary>This study do see well new investigational medical device , StimRouter ( STR ) System , work treat chronic pain people fail previous treatment Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( CTS ) pain , include surgery . These people treat CTS pain include surgical carpal tunnel release , without good result , still pain . The study look good bad effect StimRouter System treat kind pain general peripheral nerve stimulation device treat chronic pain . The study also help understand possible us StimRouter System .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Human Study : StimRouter Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Discrete Peripheral Nerves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center , open label study design evaluate clinical use StimRouter ( STR ) peripheral nerve stimulation device treatment chronic pain . The clinical study propose serve evaluation preliminary StimRouter design , propose implantation technique , electrical stimulation parameter , outcome measure StimRouter . The current study utilize median nerve ( context carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) , status-post single fail carpal tunnel release ( CTR ) surgery ) model represent device 's general intend use peripheral nerve stimulator treat chronic pain .</detailed_description>
