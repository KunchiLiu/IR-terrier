	<brief_summary>Patients end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) commonly develop hyperphosphatemia due loss excretory function kidney . This turn may lead development secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) renal osteodystrophy . Lanthanum carbonate , phosphate binding agent , work release lanthanum ion gastrointestinal tract bind dietary phosphate effective management hyperphosphatemia prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism . Patients take lanthanum carbonate part phosphate binder therapy counsel chew tablet completely swallow , immediately meal . However , ESRD patient intubate receive enteral tube feeding unable chew lanthanum carbonate tablet . For patient , medication commonly crush administered gastrostomy tube ( G-tube ) . Some patient may also prefer crush lanthanum carbonate tablet mix food instead chew . To date , know crush lanthanum carbonate tablet prior administration take food efficacious chewing . The objective study compare efficacy phosphate binding chew crushed lanthanum carbonate patient undergoing hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
