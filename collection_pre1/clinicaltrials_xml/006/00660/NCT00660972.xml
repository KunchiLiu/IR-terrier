	<brief_summary>The HIV integrase inhibitor , raltegravir ( RAL ) , recently approve FDA , show several trial highly effective . The purpose trial estimate viral load decay rate treatment-naive HIV infect participant receive RAL emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Viral Load Decay Rates HIV Infected Participants Starting Treatment With Raltegravir ( RAL ) Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent data suggest early virologic response HIV intervention may predictive long-term virologic outcome . Defining early decay viral load carefully perform study viral dynamic may useful tool assess likely outcome long-term treatment . It may also useful screen tool define combination study . In trial , viral load decay rate estimate HIV infected , treatment-naive participant receive RAL FTC/TDF . This study last approximately 72 week . All participant take RAL FTC/TDF 72 week . RAL provide study . FTC/TDF provide . This study consist 16 study visit . These visit occur study entry , Days 2 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 56 , Weeks 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 . Blood collection pharmacokinetic study occur study visit . Self-reported adherence assessment submit visit . A targeted physical exam occur visit . Liver function test urine collection occur select visit . Pregnancy test occur whenever pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
