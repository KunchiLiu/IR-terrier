	<brief_summary>This study involve two phase . Phase I study design find maximum dose paclitaxel poliglumex safely give subject combine cetuximab radiotherapy head neck cancer . Once maximum safe dose paclitaxel poliglumex find , Phase II study continue find whether addition paclitaxel poliglumex increase tumor response survival compare treatment cetuximab radiotherapy alone . An additional 20 patient add , balance data . These patient must HPV negative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Radiation Therapy , Paclitaxel Poliglumex Cetuximab Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients locally advance ( stage III IV ) head neck cancer often manage radiotherapy without chemotherapy unresectable tumor , require extensive surgery , medically unfit go radical surgery . However , treatment result conventionally fractionate radiotherapy locally advanced head neck cancer poor term local control survival . Therefore , combination radiation chemotherapy study improve treatment result . Sequential radiation-chemotherapy ( give neo-adjuvant setting ) study extensively prospective pilot large randomize trial . So far , survival advantage standard radiotherapy demonstrate , organ preservation achieve many patient . Response rate chemotherapy high , decrease distant metastasis demonstrate trial . Despite high response rate trial compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy radiotherapy alone , improved locoregional control ( LRC ) show . Concurrent radiation cisplatin-based chemotherapy show survival advantage radiotherapy alone meta-analysis . However , administration cisplatin-based chemotherapy associate significantly increase local systemic toxic effect , may preclude many patient proceed combined therapy . Therefore , great interest define active regimen contain cisplatin . An alternative approach concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy emerge development molecular target agent . A recently report randomized phase III study demonstrate improved duration control locoregional disease overall survival addition antibody epidermal growth factor receptor , cetuximab , definitive radiotherapy patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Importantly , cetuximab administration increase radiation-related toxicity . The commonly use chemotherapy cisplatin chemotherapy treatment advance head neck cancer paclitaxel . There many study show improvement tumor control paclitaxel add radiotherapy . Paclitaxel poliglumex ( PPX , CT-2103 , Xyotax ) macromolecule consist biodegradable , water-soluble polymer glutamic acid , naturally-occurring amino acid , link paclitaxel . Preclinical study suggest increase tumor uptake PPX compare paclitaxel , result enhanced tumor cell kill . PPX may potentiate tumor radiocurability without affect acute normal tissue injury . Moreover , synergistic increase tumor cell death observe paclitaxel poliglumex administer cetuximab preclinical tumor model . The propose study assess rational combination PPX radiotherapy cetuximab . This regimen great interest potential improve therapeutic ratio compare approach either cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy radiotherapy cetuximab . There also optional tissue submission component study , subject require surgery follow treatment give permission block tumor tissue remove time surgery send Cell Therapeutics , Inc. ( manufacturer PPX ) evaluation PPX accumulation , level cathepsin B , estrogen receptor expression . This information use correlate tumor response survival patient future . Since initiation study , relationship HPV head neck cancer become evident . Our initial result many HPV positive subject , therefore add 20 HPV negative patient study , determine status affect outcome .</detailed_description>
