	<brief_summary>Asthma common chronic disease childhood major cause morbidity United States . If asthma symptom control , child asthma stay well lead normal life . Daily use inhale steroid control symptom reduces morbidity emergent health care utilization child persistent asthma , safe long-term use . However , inhaled steroid underused community asthma care . The Telephone Asthma Program ( TAP ) series brief , telephone call train coach help parent manage child 's asthma care . The coach teach self-management skill , help parent use child 's asthma medicine effectively , provide support remind parent go follow-up care pediatrician . We hypothesize Telephone Asthma Program reduce incidence acute exacerbation asthma require emergent care , improve quality life child asthma parent , increase daily use inhale steroid child persistent asthma . We evaluate Telephone Asthma Program randomize control trial involve 362 child age 5 12 year old care community pediatrician . Eligible child randomize TAP program usual care pediatrician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma morbidity largely preventable effective maintenance care . National guideline recommend 1 ) daily treatment inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) prevent asthma symptom activity limitation , minimize acute exacerbation maintain normal lung function ; 2 ) early intervention guide write Asthma Action Plan worsen symptom ; 3 ) partnership primary care provider , patient family develop share treatment goal , select appropriate treatment plan , resolve asthma-related concern , provide support day-to-day care , 4 ) periodic assessment ( every 1 6 month ) physician monitor asthma control assess goal therapy meet , asthma self-management education provide diagnosis reinforce every opportunity . Despite widespread dissemination guideline , under-use controller medication pervasive , home management acute exacerbation often delayed inadequate , 50 % asthmatic child report maintenance care visit twice year . Most primary care pediatrician provide education use preventive treatment self-management behavior cite lack confidence ability effect change , logistical issue lack time , educational material , support staff , inadequate reimbursement significant barrier activity . Practical , efficient intervention improve maintenance asthma care office-practice need . In response complaint community pediatricians practice-based research network child persistent asthma use controller medication prescribe collaborated local asthma expert telephone triage service child 's hospital develop evaluate 12-month telephone-coaching program provide education support parent improve asthma self-management child . The Telephone Asthma Program ( TAP ) provide addition usual care , evaluate randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The TAP program base Transtheoretical Model Behavior Change develop James Prochaska . This model postulate series 5 ordered stage readiness change desire behavior ( Precontemplation , Contemplation , Preparation , Action Maintenance ) . The desired behavior TAP : 1 ) use controller medication prescribe , 2 ) administer rescue medication child 's first sign asthma exacerbation , 3 ) up-to-date asthma action plan readily available may need , 4 ) collaborative relationship child 's PCP include regular asthma check-up visit least every 6 month . Our goal 4 behavior would address coach parent throughout 12-month program period . Guided computerize telephone protocol coach provide tailor care advice appropriate parent 's stage readiness behavior change . In way , coach could provide education support help parent provide effective asthma care home child , supplement care provide physician .</detailed_description>
