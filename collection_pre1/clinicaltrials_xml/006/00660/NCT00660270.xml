	<detailed_description>The adjuvant therapy pancreas cancer remain challenge oncology specialist discipline since initial development pancreaticoduodenectomy Whipple 1935 ( Whipple , Ann Surg , 1935 ) . A variety phase II experience utilizing radiation therapy 5FU-based chemotherapy follow curative surgery pancreas cancer consistently produce disappointing survival result 18-24 month median survival , 40 % -50 % 2-year survival 10 % -20 % 5-year survival ( Evans , DeVita , et.al Cancer Principles Practices Oncology , 1997 ) . Indeed , whether adjuvant therapy follow pancreaticoduodenectomy pancreas cancer benefit patient remain debated question . The landmark study perform GITSG patient pancreatic cancer display survival advantage patient receive postoperative radiation therapy 5FU compare receive pancreaticoduodenectomy ( 2-year survival 43 % vs. 18 % , p=0.03 ) . As result , study become standard care patient resect pancreas cancer US ( GITSG , Cancer 1987 ) . However , study rightfully criticize variety perspectives year ; furthermore , recent experience EROTC ESPAC fail reproduce GITSG result ( Klinkenbijl , Ann Surg 1999 , Neoptolemos , Proc ASCO 2000 ) . However , result two study also receive significant criticism . The EORTC data underpowered study fail use post-radiation chemotherapy optimum advantage . The ESPAC data criticize statistically invalid trial desig10/14/02n analysis . Thus , optimization adjuvant therapy follow pancreaticoduodenectomy pancreas cancer remain subject debate pose essentially challenge oncology specialist begin 21st century past sixty year . Confronted issue , investigator Virginia Mason Clinic begin 1995 phase II trial utilize cisplatin alpha-interferon conjunction 5FU radiation therapy follow pancreaticoduodenectomy pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The logic behind protocol follow : 1 . Recurrence follow surgery adjuvant chemoradiation protocol resect pancreas cancer date associate high incidence local systemic recurrence ; thus treatment must focus improvement relapse rate area . 2 . No chemotherapy regimens ( 1995 ) , either single agent multi-agent , show response rate markedly different see single agent 5FU ( typically order 10 % ) 3 . Therapeutic advance adjuvant therapy pancreas cancer must therefore focus systemic agent potential synergize tumoricidal activity radiation therapy and/or . 4 . Cisplatin alpha-interferon , like 5FU , radiosensitizing activity experimental tumor system thus potentially could add 5FU create `` combination '' radiosensitizing agent analogous way chemotherapy agent combine systemic effect . 5 . These chemotherapeutic agent also direct synergistic anticancer activity respect experimental tumor system . 6 . These agent also , large extent , non-overlapping toxicity deliver outpatient basis . Using logic , novel phase II protocol ( radiation therapy ) adjuvant therapy pancreas cancer develop . The protocol construct follow : - XRT 5000cGy/200cGy fraction give daily M-F wks 1-5 - CDDP 30 mg/m2 1 wks 1-5 - IFN-A 3,000,000U sq qod wks 1-5 begin 1 - 5FU 200mg/m2 wks 1-5 begin 1 ; repeat wks 10-15 wks 18-23 ( 2 6 wk chemotherapy course post chemoradiation ) . Patients , general , treat within 8 week follow pancreaticoduodenectomy ( general , perform pylorus preserve procedure without extend lymph node dissection ) include patient adenocarcinomas head , body tail pancreas . Other periampullary cancer include study . The phase II trial Virginia Mason publish variety form , abstract ( Picozzi , Proc ASCO 1999,2000 ) manuscript ( Nukui , Am J Surg 2000 ) . To date , 38 patient treat Virginia Mason use method . Average patient age 64 . Thirty three patient cancer pancreas head , 5 patient body and/or tail cancer . Noteworthy series particularly high incidence adverse disease prognostic factor recurrence nodal involvement ( 79 % ) non-surgical margin positivity ( 32 % ) . Using prognostic model disease recurrence develop Johns Hopkins incorporate factor plus tumor type ( pancreatic head versus periampullary cancer ) , tumor size , tumor differentiation estimate blood loss surgery , 37/38 patient ( 97 % ) judge high risk disease recurrence . Results trial update February , 2001include follow important result : - All patient ( 38/38 ) treat date complete chemoradiation phase treatment ( wks 1-5 ) ; 35/38 patient complete entire treatment course . - Approximately 90 % plan chemotherapy deliver ; virtually plan radiation therapy deliver . - Toxicity almost entirely GI-related ( anorexia/dehydration , mucositis , nausea/vomiting , diarrhea ) . - As result toxicity , majority patient require treatment delay chemoradiation approximately 30 % ( 13/38 ) require hospitalization . However , treatment-related fatality , patient regain full functional status . - Median follow-up present great 2 year ; 21/38 patient follow great 2 year . 28/38 ( 74 % ) patient remain alive , 25/38 ( 67 % ) patient remain alive disease free . - At present , median survivorship patient cohort excess 45 month ( 45.8 month , 95 % confidence limit 36-55 month ) ; actuarial 2-year 5-year survivorships 65 % 60 % , respectively . 13/21 patient follow two year remain alive time ( include 3 patient alive 5 year initial diagnosis ) . If 33 patient adenocarcinomas pancreas head phase II trial consider , median survivorship rise 49 month ( 95 % confidence limit 39-59 month ) . Actuarial 2-year 5-year survivorships 73 % 68 % respectively . - All recurrence take place 5 22 month time diagnosis ( none later ) . - The recurrence pattern see date follow ; 2 patient local recurrence , 7 patient systemic 4 patient local systemic recurrence . The local control rate thus approximately 85 % ( 32/38 patient ) systemic control rate approximately 70 % ( 27/38 patient ) . More detailed data 38 patient adenocarcinomas pancreas treat use protocol Virginia Mason date display Figure 1 . These data present Pancreas Cancer Committee ACOSOG December,2000 . Meeting participant agree development protocol give treatment result see comparison historical precedent previously cite . These outcome see particularly favorable give high-risk nature patient population study . However , protocol also receive follow criticism meet participant , include NCI reviewer . First , protocol study date single institution . Second , toxicity regimen see quite significant , especially chemoradiation , 30 % patient hospitalize . Finally , post-chemoradiation phase chemotherapy ( infusional 5FU ) see potentially suboptimal , several type chemotherapy regimen , include combination regimen utilizing infusional 5FU ( ref ) gemcitabine ( ref ) produce superior response rate phase II trial see single agent 5FU . As result dialog , decide ACOSOG Pancreas Cancer committee develop multi-institutional phase II trial base upon Virginia Mason protocol would incorporate comment . It also felt effort conflict phase III protocol plan committee compare multi-agent 5FU-based regimen develop UCLA radiation therapy single agent 5FU approach use GITSG . To address protocol-related concern mention , follow modification original Virginia Mason protocol suggest : The issue toxicity chemoradiation address three way . First , radiation therapy deliver confined field , particularly give predominance systemic recurrence therapeutic result date . Second , dose intensity chemotherapy agent ( cisplatin , 5FU , Alpha-interferon ) give radiation reduce slightly . This do remembering majority patient ( approximately 70 % ) require break treatment phase therapy . Finally , assist provider new protocol , supportive care pathway develop assist avoidance treatment relate toxicity ( e.g . nausea , gastritis , hyperglycemia ) treatment .</detailed_description>
