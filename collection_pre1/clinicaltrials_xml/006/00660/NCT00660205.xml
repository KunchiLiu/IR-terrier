	<brief_summary>Cancer well know risk factor venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Today know patient adenocarcinomas gastro intestinal tract ( GI-tract ) often hypercoagulable state . In observational study collect patient admit department tentative diagnosis upper GI cancer include pancreas cancer offer flow doppler ultrasound legs diagnosis DVT entire treatment time . The routine CT-scan chest modify diagnose PE . This compare blood sample analyse coagulation marker include D-dimer - fibrinogen degradation product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Armand Troussau observe back 1865 particular condition blood predisposes spontaneous coagulation patient gastric cancer . Today know adenocarcinomas gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract include tumour colon rectum accompany hypercoagulable state . Cancer well know risk factor venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . In fact PE cancer patient second common cause death . In analysis 13 cohort study publish observational data Otten Prins conclude prevalence VTE cancer patient vary 10 20 % . Variation could explain inconsistency . Patients suffer thrombosis secondary hemi paresis paraplegia include . Patients include time VTE time cancer diagnosis . Levitan et al look discharge diagnosis 1211944 cancer patient find among gastric cancer patient frequency VTE 85 per 10000 patient pancreatic cancer 110 per 10000 . Gastric cancer patient relative risk 1.49 compare non-cancer patient pancreatic cancer patient relative risk 2.05 compare non-cancer patient . This put pancreatic cancer among prone malignancy cause thromboembolic complication . In newly publish study 202 pancreatic cancer patient 19 develop venous thrombosis result 58 fold increase risk compare general population incidence 108/1000 patient-years cumulative incidence 6 month 74/1000 . 15 19 case VTE occur first 6 month since diagnosis cancer . Tumours locate corpus cauda twice risk caput . Chemotherapy result 4.8 fold risk venous thrombosis . Postoperatively VTE high cancer patient non-cancer patient surgery . A multicenter study include Danish patient - use phlebography - show VTE 23 % patient surgery colorectal cancer . Coagulation activity - assess sensitive biochemical marker - relate tumour load . Stender et al newly publish study show high preoperative prevalence DVT 193 colorectal cancer patient prevalence 16 % woman 2.6 % men . In another newly publish study asymptomatic DVT find ovarian cancer patient elevated level D-Dimer treatment . The mechanism cancer induce VTE present subject great interest . Plasma D-dimer ( DD ) , degradation product cross-linked fibrin , routinely used support exclude tentative diagnosis DVT , combine clinical assessment ultrasonography ( US ) . The accuracy DD assay cancer patient unknown , despite high negative predictive value ( NPV ) non cancer patient . A negative DD seem exclude PE cancer patient , DD combination image technique US compute tomography ( CT ) seem improve diagnostic work-up need investigation .</detailed_description>
