	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis B virus ( HIV/HBV ) co-infections frequently observe due share route transmission , report figure indicate 6-9 % HIV-infected individual develop country chronically infected HBV . HIV infection impact natural progression HBV infection , increase level HBV replication risk liver-associated mortality . Liver diseases associate HBV affect antiviral drug use HIV infection ( toxic side effect ) , current immune function patient , improvement immune system bring control HIV infection , development resistance antiviral agent use hepatitis B HIV infection . Tenofovir ( TDF ) new antiviral drug frequently use HIV infection also highly active hepatitis B ; however still unknown whether resistance TDF eventually develop affect long-term outcome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Surveillance Program Detection Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) Resistance Tenofovir HIV-HBV co-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) nucleotide analogue inhibit HIV HBV DNA polymerase , active wild-type HBV HBV strain contain lamivudine-associated polymerase gene mutation ( Dore , Cooper et al . 2004 ) . TDF approve use , combination antiretrovirals , HIV therapy April 2002 Australia . It currently approve use Australia treatment HBV mono-infection . TDF recently become available Thailand HIV/HBV co-infected individual predominantly infect genotype B C. In contrast , Australia Europe , dominant HBV genotype HIV/HBV co-infected individual A D. As antiviral agent concern long-term use development resistance . There report signature mutation lead TDF resistance rtA194T ( Sheldon et al. , 2005 ) . We recently conduct retrospective study HIV/HBV co infect individual Melbourne receive TDF least 3 month . Twenty-eight patient sample available TDF four ( ~14 % ) detectable HBV DNA PCR . We identify mutation rtA194T rtV214A/Q215S individual fail TDF find persist mutation LMV-resistant mutation . These finding highlight need surveillance system HIV-HBV co-infected individual receive TDF detection novel mutation four major HBV genotype . In addition , important determine clinical virological risk factor TDF failure . This particularly important give agent use indefinitely patient population development unique drug resistant mutation implication progression liver disease future therapeutic choice . This study recruit patient co-infected HIV HBV , currently take commence anti-HIV drug TDF . The study cohort include HIV-HBV co-infected individual Alfred Hospital Melbourne Sexual Health Clinic . Other site , cover application , St Vincent 's Hospital , Sydney King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital , Bangkok , Thailand . The aim study identify change HBV DNA might associate resistance TDF , determine long change take occur determine effect change clinical response TDF . This achieve 6 monthly assessment 2 year period , medical history , physical examination , routine clinical investigation , hepatitis B activity HBV DNA sequencing .</detailed_description>
