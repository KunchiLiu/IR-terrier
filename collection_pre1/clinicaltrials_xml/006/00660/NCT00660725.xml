	<brief_title>Study GemOx Vandetanib Advanced Solid Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalating , non-randomized study safety tolerability vandetanib combination fix dose gemcitabine oxaliplatin ( GemOx ) treatment patient advance solid malignancy . EGFR important target therapeutic drug development . It widely express cancer vital role regulation proliferation signal . EGFR express high degree ( &gt; 80 % ) pancreatic tumor rational target therapy . Vandetanib selectively inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity VEGF-2 receptor . It good oral bioavailability growth inhibitory activity wide variety human cell line include cell acquire resistance EGFR inhibitor . The growth inhibitory property vandetanib vivo correlate anti VEGF property , especially cell line acquire resistance EGFR inhibition . The combination gemcitabine oxaliplatin ( GEMOX ) well-established regimen demonstrate encouraging antitumor activity pancreaticobiliary cancer phase II study . Recent clinical trial also show activity hepatobiliary germ cell tumor . The combination vandetanib gemcitabine potential advantage may result additive synergistic effect . The GEMOX regimen well tolerate , toxicity overlap common toxicity rash diarrhea observe vandetanib . Thus , combination vandetanib GEMOX expect well tolerate , easily administer regimen improve efficacy overlap toxicity .</detailed_description>

Patients brain metastasis receive appropriate therapy stable disease least 4 week radiotherapy/surgery . Subjects recover side effect prior therapy grade 1 less Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make undesirable patient participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol . Clinically significant cardiovascular event ( e.g . myocardial infarction , superior vena cava syndrome ( SVC ) , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification heart disease ≥2 within 3 month entry ; presence cardiac disease , opinion Investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia . History arrhythmia ( multifocal premature ventricular contraction PVCs ) , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ) symptomatic require treatment ( CTCAE grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude . Previous history QTc prolongation medication require discontinuation medication . Congenital long QT syndrome 1st degree relative unexplained sudden death 40 year age . Presence leave bundle branch block ( LBBB . ) QTc Bazett 's correction unmeasurable , ≥480 msec screen ECG . ( Note : If subject QTc interval ≥480 msec screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must &lt; 480 msec order subject eligible study . ) Patients receive drug risk QTc prolongation exclude QTc ≥ 460 msec . Any concurrent medication may cause QTc prolongation induce Torsades de Pointes . Hypertension control medical therapy ( systolic blood pressure great 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 100 mm Hg ) Currently active diarrhea may affect ability patient absorb vandetanib tolerate diarrhea . Women currently pregnant breast feeding . Receipt investigational agent within 30 day commercially available agent within 21 day prior commence study treatment Last dose prior chemotherapy discontinue less 4 week start study therapy Last radiation therapy within last 4 week start study therapy , except palliative radiotherapy le 12 fraction Any unresolved toxicity great CTCAE grade 1 previous anticancer therapy Previous enrollment randomization treatment present study Major surgery within 4 week , incompletely heal surgical incision start study therapy Peripheral neuropathy grade 2 great severity cause More 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen advance stage disease . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy count prior regimen . Known severe hypersensitivity vandetanib excipients product .
