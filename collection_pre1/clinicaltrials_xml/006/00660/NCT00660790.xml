	<brief_title>Multifactorial Treatment Cardiovascular Risk Diabetic Patients : Identification Treatment Non-Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients type-2 diabetes face substantially elevate risk cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . This risk base traditional non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor . It , thus , partially mediate modifiable condition instance blood pressure , cholesterol , hyperglycemia . Indeed , control prospective intervention study highlight individual lowering risk factor result reduction vascular event acute coronary syndrome stroke . The STENO-2 trial convincingly prove multifactorial risk intervention , target risk factor substantially slow progression atherosclerosis . As result even great 50 % reduction vascular risk patient type-2 diabetes observe . Thus , state art treatment type-2 diabetic patient multifactorial risk intervention target glucose control , lipid , blood pressure , platelets rennin-angiotensin-system . Rationale : Risk normalisation type-2 diabetic patient reach STENO-2 trial . In addition , , , possible predict early treatment stage suffer progressive atherosclerosis future event despite intensive treatment risk factor . Such early identification treatment non-responders could enable intensify treatment develop new treatment strategy . Aim : To develop model allow early identification type-2 diabetic patient face progressive atherosclerosis despite intensive , multifactorial , target orient treatment . Experimental approach : To pursue mentioned aim , investigate , patient indication multifactorial risk intervention , either baseline characteristic treatment responses 3 month intensify , multifactorial risk intervention use predict progressive atherosclerosis study period 2 year . To construct model , traditional non-traditional vascular risk factor evaluate . Traditional vascular risk factor : Traditional vascular risk factor may group accord whether may modify . The major modifiable risk factor hypertension , lipid , hyperglycemia . All treat lifestyle modification pharmacologically . Smoking behaviour , sedentary lifestyle , nutrition weight hand may influence lifestyle advice . Classic risk model Framingham algorithm PROCAM model base traditional risk factor risk estimation . They , however , limited applicability diabetic patient due small number patient include lack diabetes-specific variable model . From UKPDS data risk model type-2 diabetes develop describes future vascular risk base traditional risk factor include glycemic control duration diabetes . It risk engine develop diabetic population . This model , however , take account lipid lower treatment general , treatment response intensify intervention , novel vascular risk factor . Novel , non-traditional vascular risk factor : Endothelial dysfunction well inflammatory activity , reduce endothelial progenitor cell , increase endothelial microparticles see integral vascular risk factor indicator , represent combine influence different traditional risk factor well specific vascular susceptibility . As , show influenced hyperglycemia , blood pressure cholesterol . Specific treatment risk factor result improvement endothelial dysfunction , reduction inflammatory activity , increase number endothelial progenitor cell . Very recently , data Hoorn-study indicate indeed 43 % excess vascular risk observe diabetic patient base endothelial dysfunction inflammatory activity . These data point importance non-traditional risk factor development atherosclerosis vascular event . Progression carotid artery IMT vascular endpoint : The intima-media-thickness carotid artery ( IMT ) closely related atherosclerotic burden coronary artery risk acute vascular event . It progressively increase time , drive age cardiovascular risk factor . A high progression rate IMT indicative future vascular event treatment risk factor reduce progression IMT . Consequently , progression IMT highly valid surrogate endpoint progression atherosclerosis future vascular event . Risk factor test : Traditional risk factor : Age , Gender , smoke behaviour , family history CAD stroke , physical activity , lipid ( total cholesterol , LDL-C , HDL-C , TG , ApoA1 , ApoB , Apo ( ) ) , office blood pressure , serum creatinine , albuminuria , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( ECG ) Diabetes specific risk factor : Duration diabetes , HbA1c , fast insulin , fast proinsulin , fast glycemia , HOMA , glucose tolerance , BMI , waist circumference Non-traditional risk factor : Carotid artery IMT , prevalence extend carotid plaque , pulse wave velocity , vascular stiffness , ankle-brachial-index , endothelial function , inflammatory activity ( accord Hoorn Study method ) , endothelial progenitor cell , endothelial microparticles , plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , tissue factor ( TF ) . Indication multifactorial risk intervention : Based present knowledge type-2 diabetic patient high risk subject development vascular disease event . The excess risk , depend population study range 2-6 fold . For reason , every patient type-2 diabetes per se indication multifactorial risk intervention . Intervention : Target orient treatment risk factor accord current treatment guideline . Pharmacological therapy either newly instal change accord outline . All patient receive comprehensive lifestyle counseling , personalize nutrition , exercise advice . After 3 month modifiable potentially variable risk factor evaluate . 18 month inclusion study carotid artery IMT measure . Outcome variable : The progression IMT baseline 18 month primary ( dependent ) outcome variable development model . Modeling process : All risk factor variable test model test univariate regression analyse progression IMT dependent variable . All variable p value 0.200 include multivariate regression analysis use stepwise inclusion process . Potential benefit : Early identification type-2 diabetic patient , despite intensified multifactorial risk intervention , face progressive atherosclerosis . Such patient , consequence could receive individualized treatment mean even intensive intervention application different treatment strategy . As result improve prevention vascular event type-2 diabetic patient could finally reach .</detailed_description>
