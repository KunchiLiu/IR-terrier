	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study ferumoxytol work contrast agent assess early response patient glioblastoma multiforme receive temozolomide radiation therapy . Ferumoxytol small form iron particle inject body take certain tissue may make tissue easy see image . Diagnostic procedure , MRI study ferumoxytol , may help measure patient 's response earlier treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Study With Ferumoxytol Assessing Early Response Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme Receiving Temozolomide Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) tumor vascular property use ferumoxytol ( ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite ) compare obtain use gadolinium ( Gd ) base MRI contrast agent . II . To characterize vascular change GBM tumor associate standard radio/chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , mean transit time ( MTT ) , time-to-peak ( TTP ) perfusion parameter measure contrast agent evaluate post-hoc analysis . II . To obtain qualitative assessment tumor vascularity use time-of-flight ( TOF ) magnetic resonance ( MR ) angiography technique . III . To characterize change apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) tumor water associate standard radio/chemotherapy GBM . OUTLINE : Patients receive gadolinium intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite IV day 2 undergo dynamic susceptibility contrast enhance ( DSC ) MRI , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) ( day 1 ) , TOF MR angiography day 1-3 4 time point : radiation , 3 week initiation radiation plus temozolomide , end radiation ( 6 week post first dose ) 6 week radiation ( 12 week post first dose ) . Ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite administration continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive temozolomide undergo radiation therapy per standard care . After completion ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite administration , patient follow 4-6 week periodically resolution stabilization unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
