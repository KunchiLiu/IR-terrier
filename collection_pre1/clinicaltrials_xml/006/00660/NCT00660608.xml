	<brief_summary>Fifty patient enrol study . The purpose study investigate relevance Hct level determine need transfusion operation employ bypass well test hypothesis , HCt level may decrease surgery , red blood cell mass tissue oxygenation remain fairly constant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty adult ( male female-nonpregnant ) whose weight 55-85 kg schedule undergo elective cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass CABG primary valve repair replacement eligible . Patients history abnormal bleeding disorder , urgent emergent need surgery , combination surgery exclude . Blood volume analysis perform DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer BVA-100 System Volumex HSA I-131 radiopharmaceutical use determine circulating volume . Multiple time sample point obtain . The DAXOR blood volume analyzer batch sample input patient height , weight , gender , time draw , correspond Hct , calculate circulating total blood volume . We hypothesize Total red cell mass relatively well conserve ( &lt; 20 % decrease ) immediately surgery long major bleed occur . We hypothesize decrease Hct surgery relate change circulate plasma volume . Total red cell O2 carry capacity O2 economics measure also hypothesize lower Hct value , even low 15 % , independently signal tissue whole body O2 deficit .</detailed_description>
