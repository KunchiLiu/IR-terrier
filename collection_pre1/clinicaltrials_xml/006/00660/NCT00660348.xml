	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving medication different way may change effectiveness control pain . It yet know whether intrathecal therapy effective standard therapy control pain patient pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study standard pain control see well work compare intrathecal therapy control pain patient locally advance , unresectable , metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Pain Control Intrathecal Therapy Controlling Pain Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare effectiveness pain control comprise intrathecal opioid delivery versus standard analgesia-delivery method patient locally advance , unresectable , metastatic pancreatic cancer . Secondary - To assess difference total amount opioid consumption ( parenteral morphine equivalent ) two different opioids-delivery group one month treatment . - To assess average percent change Karnofsky performance status respect baseline status two different analgesic-delivery group one month treatment . - To assess difference quality life two different opioids-delivery group one month treatment use EORTC QLQ-C30 . - To assess overall survival patient . - To assess safety profile two different analgesic-delivery method ( i.e. , adverse event serious adverse event ) . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord Karnofsky performance status ( 60-80 % v &gt; 80 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( standard pain management ) : Patients evaluate JHH Pain Medicine Integrated Team pain , potential diagnostic/neurolytic celiac plexus block , undergo institution modification continuation titration oral parenteral analgesic . Patients undergo limited , problem-oriented physical exam include weight , vital sign , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) , assessment previously abnormal finding new complaint , pain score , analgesia consumption , side effect ( i.e. , sleepiness , nausea , pruritus , constipation ) , quality-of-life score ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) every 2 week 3 month month thereafter . Patients also keep diary pain score side effect trial . Patients may treatment titrate need control pain . Patients adequately pain controlled develop debilitate side effect therapy may manage adjuvant analgesic allow crossover treatment arm study provide compassionate care . - Arm II ( intrathecal therapy ) : Patients undergo implantation Medtronic intrathecal pump catheter system delivery morphine sulfate directly spinal fluid . Following implantation , patient undergo limited , problem-oriented physical exam include vital sign , KPS , assessment previously abnormal finding new complaint , pain score , analgesia consumption , quality-of life-score ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) every 2 week 3 month month thereafter . Patients also evaluate Interventional Pain Treatment Team wound status , presence symptom post-dural puncture headache , sign infection , meningitis . Patients follow JHH Pain Medicine Integrated Team evaluation pain institution modification continuation titration oral parenteral analgesic . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
