	<brief_summary>This study measure antibody level blood people bleed swell retina treat bevacizumab ( Avastin [ Trademark ] ranibizumab ( Lucentis [ Trademark ] ) . These drug useful reduce retinal bleeding swell people eye diseases cause symptom , drug ' effect usually wear give repeatedly . In patient , benefit become less less . It possible time , patient take drug may produce antibody act drug , thus neutralize effect prevent work properly . People 18 year age old participate current NEI protocol meet follow criterion may eligible study : - Are receive injection bevacizumab ranibizumab bleed swell retina , treatment become less effective - Are receive injection bevacizumab ranibizumab bleed swell retina treatment still effective - Have bleed swell retina , never receive either bevacizumab ranibizumab Participants blood sample draw start study , middle study , end study . They ask permission study researcher review result eye examination NIH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Neutralizing Antibodies Patients Treated With Bevacizumab Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Over past two year , field ophthalmology witness dramatic paradigm shift treatment exudative hemorrhagic disease affect retina . This due largely introduction two agent , bevacizumab ranibizumab , clinical setting . These agent humanize monoclonal antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . We observe , patient , diminish response agent occurs time . One possible explanation emergence neutralize antibody patient become refractory bevacizumab ranibizumab . Study Population We recruit patient National Eye Institute ( NEI ) currently receive treatment bevacizumab ranibizumab various exudative hemorrhagic disease retina . We also recruit patient recently diagnose exudative hemorrhagic disease retina na medication go treated . Design This prospective , observational study . Outcome Measures The main outcome measure titer neutralize antibody measure patient serum use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . This compare three group patient : 1 ) 10 patient treat long term ( great 1 year ) bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab decrease drug efficacy document ; 2 ) 10 patient treat long term ( great one year ) bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab decrease drug efficacy document ; 3 ) 10 patient na treatment bevacizumab ranibizumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects include adult treat exudative AMD , macular edema secondary DR venous occlusion . The 3 clinical category , compose 10 subject , : 1 . Category 1 : Patients treat long term ( great 1 year ) bevacizumab ranibizumab decrease drug efficacy document . They must receive least one treatment prior 3 month . Decreased drug efficacy define follow : Presence therapeutic response ( reduction macula fluid determine optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) reduction extent leakage fluorescein angiography ( FA ) ) first 3 injection , follow subsequent decrease response evidence persistence intraretinal cyst and/or subretinal fluid OCT and/or leakage fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . 2 . Category 2 : Patients treat long term ( great 1 year ) bevacizumab ranibizumab decrease drug efficacy document . They must receive least one treatment prior 3 month . The presence continue drug efficacy define follow : Patients treat bevacizumab ranibizumab demonstrate good clinical response demonstrate presence fluidfree macula OCT and/or absence leakage FA treatment . 3 . Category 3 : Patients na treatment bevacizumab ranibizumab When possible , patient 3 category match underlie retinal disease type , race , gender , age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow category exclude participate study : 1 . Patients currently receive form systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulatory therapy , include corticosteroid . Immunosuppressive medication could lower titer neutralize present give patient , could give false impression patient little immune response bevacizumab ranibizumab . 2 . Patients autoimmune rheumatologic disease . Patients autoimmune disease tend various autoantibody serum . These naturally present autoantibody patient group could crossreact bevacizumab ranibizumab . This would give false impression patient develop neutralize antibody bevacizumab ranibizumab , fact naturally occur crossreactive autoantibody present patient along related bevacizumab ranibizumab exposure . 3 . Patients evidence active systemic infection . Patients active systemic infection could various antibody serum , could crossreact bevacizumab ranibizumab . This would give false impression patient develop neutralize antibody bevacizumab ranibizumab , fact crossreactive antibody present patient secondary presence active systemic infection relate bevacizumab ranibizumab .</criteria>
