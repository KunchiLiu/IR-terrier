	<brief_summary>This study determine acamprosate , drug approve treat alcoholism , decrease alcohol craving alcohol-dependent subject follow infusion yohimbine mCPP . Yohimbine cause anxiety may provoke desire alcohol ; mCPP induces feel drink , often create desire drink . If acamprosate prevent crave follow stimulus , effectiveness new experimental drug treat alcoholism test ability block yohimbine mCPP-induced craving . This type investigation would less expensive less time-consuming conduct clinical trial alcohol-dependent people . People 21 65 year age alcohol-dependent drinking regularly least 1 month enter study may eligible participate . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 35 day , time ask participate alcohol treatment program . They may request pass leave hospital day must return overnight . Upon return hospital , subject require take breathalyzer test alcohol urine screen drug use . Participants find use drug consume alcohol away hospital terminate study . Participants randomly assign take acamprosate placebo pill three time day 2 week . They give three intravenous ( vein ) infusion , 5 7 day apart , contain either yohimbine , mCPP placebo . The drug infuse 20 minute follow 1-hour infusion saline ( salt water ) . Subjects complete two questionnaire - alcohol urge questionnaire ass desire alcohol PASS rating scale assess anxiety - several time study infusion ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation Pharmacologically Induced Alcohol Craving Recently Detoxified Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective present study establish , laboratory , publish model pharmacologically induced alcohol craving , carry initial evaluation predictive validity efficacy treatment alcoholism . Two pharmacological challenge test : 1 . The alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine , reliably induce reinstatement alcohol seek experimental animal , produce less clear result human . 2 . The serotonergic compound mCPP , report robustly increase alcohol crave human alcoholic , animal data less clear . Our objective study evaluate craving response infusion yohimbine mCPP use optimal assessment tool subject population , establish sensitivity clinically effective alcoholism medication acamprosate . Study Population : The study carry 60 subject age 21-65 year , alcohol dependence primary complaint , without serious medical psychiatric condition . An additional inclusion criterion elevate trait anxiety measure Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory . Subjects admit NIAAA research inpatient unit NIH Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) platform train natural history protocol ( 05-AA-0121 Assessment Treatment People Alcohol Drinking Problems ) , provide basic assessment standard withdrawal treatment need . Patients enter present protocol treatment , need , complete . Design : Following inclusion , subject randomize acamprosate ( n=25 ) placebo ( n=25 ) , receive either 3 tablet 333mg acamprosate three time daily , receive identically look placebo . Following minimum 2 week treatment , subject undergo three challenge session , minimum 5 day apart , yohimbine , m-CPP placebo infusion , counterbalance order . Outcome Measures : During challenge session , subjective craving alcohol assess use Alcohol Urge Questionnaire . Neuroendocrine cardiovascular measure collect exploratory purpose .</detailed_description>
