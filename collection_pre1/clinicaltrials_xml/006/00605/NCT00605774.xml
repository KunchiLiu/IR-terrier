	<brief_summary>When patient Type 1 diabetes exercise , prone low blood sugar , hypoglycemia . It known antecedent exercise blunt defense response , call counterregulatory response subsequent hypoglycemia Type 1 DM , cause vulnerable another bout hypoglycemia . Epinephrine one important hormone defense blood glucose exercise hypoglycemia . We test hypothesis antecedent exercise blunt metabolic , neuroendocrine cardiovascular effect subsequent epinephrine infusion Type 1 DM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure Type 1 DM , Q5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recently perform study determine whether critical metabolic action epinephrine blunt Type 1 DM . These study obvious clinical relevance strategy aim increase circulating level epinephrine effective metabolic counterregulatory mechanism ( increase endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) , increase lipolysis reduce glucose uptake ) hormone also blunt . Epinephrine infuse reach circulating level ~ 1000 pg/ml ( This level epinephrine equivalent value hormone observe hypoglycemia 50 mg/dl healthy male T1DM men average glucose control ) group either intensively treat ( HBA1C &lt; 7.0 % ) , conventionally treat ( HBA1C &gt; 9.0 % ) type 1 DM age , weight match healthy control . In intensively treated DM group , epinephrine 's action increase EGP , lipolysis restrain glucose uptake significantly reduce ( &lt; 60 % ) . The mechanism find need determine . Our hypothesis antecedent exercise cause repetitive activation Autonomic-adrenomedullary response lead downregulation β-adrenoreceptor mechanism . Therefore , combination blunt epinephrine effect , increase insulin action reduce level catecholamine might fully explain vex clinical question post exercise hypoglycemia Type 1 DM . In application , test hypothesis antecedent exercise blunt metabolic , neuroendocrine cardiovascular effect subsequent epinephrine infusion Type 1 DM .</detailed_description>
