	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ablation procedure typically involve isolation pulmonary vein ( PVs ) , yet need extensive ablation strategy patient unclear . OBJECTIVE : We conduct randomize study compare safety effectiveness two interventional ablation technique treatment paroxysmal atrial fibrillation : segmental pulmonary vein ablation approach , ( 1 ) empiric isolation pulmonary vein ( 2 ) Segmental Isolation arrhythmogenic pulmonary vein ( ) . The single-blind interventional , randomize study include 106 patient arm . A reablation procedure , use technique first ablation , offer patient case symptomatic atrial fibrillation recurrence beyond third month ablation procedure . Follow-Up After discharge , patient w ill schedule repeat visit arrhythmia clinic 3 6 month first ablation . At visit , intensive question arrhythmia-related symptom ( fatigue , dizziness , nausea ) since last follow-up visit perform , especially patient experienced ablation . At every follow-up visit , 7-day Holter monitoring w ill perform . Multislice CT MRI pulmonary vein w ill obtain 3 month ablation procedure evaluation pulmonary vein anatomy detection radiofrequency ablation-induced pulmonary vein stenosis . Study End Points Definitions The primary end point study freedom atrial tachyarrhythmias ( &gt; 30-second duration ) include atrial fibrillation atypical atrial flutter document 7-day Holter monitoring perform 6-month follow-up . Two secondary study end point choose . The first freedom arrhythmia-related symptom 6-month follow-up . Because early recurrence atrial tachyarrhythmias within first month ablation may transient phenomenon , time interval exclude analysis . Second , composite periprocedural pericardial tamponade , thromboembolic complication , pulmonary vein stenosis &gt; 50 % lumen loss ( main vessel first branch ) define safety end point</detailed_description>
