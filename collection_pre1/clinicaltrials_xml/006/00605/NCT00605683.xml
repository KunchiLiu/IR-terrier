	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease major neurodegenerative disorder progressive loss nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron . The understanding PD syndrome dopamine ( DA ) deficiency lead introduction clinical practice L-dopa , precursor DA cross blood brain barrier , also use selective inhibitor MAO B , major DA metabolising enzyme man . This double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , randomised , multi-centre , multi national , Phase III trial , compare two dos safinamide ( 50 100 mg p.o . q.a.m . ) versus placebo add-on therapy stable dose single dopamine agonist subject early idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease . The principal efficacy measure , i.e. , change mean value UPDRS - Section III total score baseline endpoint , choose base regulatory guidance prior use trial similar population .</brief_summary>
