	<brief_summary>Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) severe lung condition cause respiratory failure . Symptoms usually develop within 24 48 hour original injury illness , people ALI/ARDS typically require care intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Little known prevent onset ALI/ARDS . The purpose study examine early infusion insulin , know intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) , help prevent ALI/ARDS hospitalized patient high level blood sugar severe infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Insulin Development ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS life-threatening condition involve inflammation lung fluid accumulation air sac , lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . Common cause include pneumonia , lung trauma , sepsis , condition lead widespread inflammation blood clot response infection . Recent study show insulin , regularly use control blood sugar level , may prevent lessen risk lung tissue inflammation and/or lung injury relate sepsis . Research show critically ill ICU patient often benefit receive insulin target 80-110 mg/dl , know insulin target level prevent onset ALI/ARDS . Therapies prevent ALI/ARDS occur early , preferably even prior ICU admission , least 38 % people ALI/ARDS diagnose condition reach ICU . The purpose study determine whether insulin target 80-110 mg/dl administer critically ill patient emergency department ( ED ) beneficial preventing ALI/ARDS insulin target 150-180 mg/dl ICU admission . This study enroll people hospitalize high blood sugar level severe sepsis . Participants randomly assign receive IIT within 6-12 hour ED presentation target 80-110 mg/dl target 150-180 mg/dl 48 hour admission ICU follow usual care . Prior ICU admission 1 , 3 , 7 day ICU admission , blood collect analyzed marker inflammation lung injury . Blood sample store future research study . While participant hospital , medical record review gather information medical family history , demographic , vital sign , laboratory test result , x-ray finding , lung function . Study researcher also monitor participant development severe lung failure organ failure .</detailed_description>
