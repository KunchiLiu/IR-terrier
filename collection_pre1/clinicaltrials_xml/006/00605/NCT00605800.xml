	<brief_summary>The result study may may establish useful baseline data , help u understand bone marrow derive adult liver stem cell behave normal healthy adults/volunteers ( control group ) , patient undergo liver surgery . The bone marrow locate within bone organ responsible produce blood cell stem cell . Bone marrow derive adult liver stem cell normal cell bone marrow . These liver stem cell capacity regenerate word rebuild liver liver surgery , process call liver regeneration . These cell important liver regrow tissue liver surgery . These cell think activate time need liver . Situations like liver surgery one occasion liver need `` extra help '' stem cell . The result study establish baseline data necessary understanding harness ability stem cell time liver surgery . Improvements ability liver regrow surgery thought decrease complication relate liver surgery . Harnessing unique ability stem cell may utilize future enhance regrow process liver tissue liver surgery , call liver regeneration .</brief_summary>
