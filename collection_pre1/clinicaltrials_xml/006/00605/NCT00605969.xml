	<brief_summary>One leading cause hip arthritis femoro-acetabular impingement mean hip joint deform hip joint jam front hip bent way forward . This lead significant damage hip joint may result need total hip replacement . However , detect early , deformity treat surgically reshape hip joint . If hip joint could better visualize surgery , surgeon would able develop less invasive surgical technique correct deformity . In study , try develop way help surgeon visualize hip joint surgery order assist pre-operative planning . This do comparing dynamic hip image patient femoro-acetabular impingement hip image healthy volunteer hip problem .</brief_summary>
