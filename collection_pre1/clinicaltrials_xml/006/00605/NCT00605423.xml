	<detailed_description>Treatment exudative age-related macular degeneration significantly improve advent Lucentis™ ( provide improve vision rather simply stabilization ) common ; however , monthly injection may require maintain effect . The use glucocorticoids triamcinolone acetonide adjunct treatment exudative age-related macular degeneration report enhance efficacy photodynamic therapy Visudyne® ( verteporphin injection ) . It hypothesize sustained release fluocinolone acetonide allow maintenance improve vision few Lucentis injection . This study pilot phase 2b study test hypothesis . The safety assessment continue 36 months.This study compare safety 2 dos FA/Medidur conjunction Lucentis ( need ) patient neovascular AMD treat Lucentis least 6 month reach plateau .</detailed_description>
