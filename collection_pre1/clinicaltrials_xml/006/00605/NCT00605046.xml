	<brief_summary>Purpose : The main objective proposal follow : To assess dynamic uptake washout 123-I AV151 , potential imaging biomarker β-amyloid burden brain , use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) similarly age healthy control Alzheimer 's ( AD ) subject To perform blood metabolite characterization 123-I AV151 healthy AD subject determine metabolic fate nature metabolites assessment 123-I AV151 single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) brain image agent Evaluate test/retest reproducibility 123-I AV151 SPECT AD subject healthy control</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation 123I AV151 SPECT Subjects w/ AD Comparison Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Design Methods . The underlying goal study assess 123-I AV151 SPECT image tool detect ß-amyloid deposition brain AD research participant age- gender-matched healthy subject . All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 20 patient Alzheimers disease ( AD ) 10 healthy control recruit participate study . Healthy control examined ensure evidence neurodegenerative change include cognitive decline . Informed consent obtain . All subject undergo screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo bolus injection 123-I AV151 . Subjects undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I AV151 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 6 hour . Subjects may ask undergo second image visit 2 6 week follow initial image visit follow similar procedure initial image visit evaluate reproducibility image measure use procedure . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I AV151 . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result AD patient control compare . For subject undergo repeat image visit , data initial scan compare second scan determine offer reproducibility image outcome measure .</detailed_description>
