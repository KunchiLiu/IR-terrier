	<brief_summary>This study examine microbe ( e.g. , bacteria , fungi , virus ) live human skin microbe contribute health disease . It analyze healthy human skin microorganism might change patient atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , skin condition also know eczema . Healthy volunteer , well patient moderate severe eczema ( AD ) , 2 40 year age may eligible study . We also wish enroll child adult age 2-40 diagnosed inherit immune disorder know HIES ( hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome ) , WAS ( Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ) , DOCK8 immunodeficiency frequently skin problem similar AD . Eligible participant undergo follow test procedure : - Medical family medication history - Skin examination - Blood test ( research blood well serum IgE , complete blood count ) - Skin sample analyze microbe . Samples obtain follow method : swab skin cotton swab ; scrap ( scratch ) skin gently blade remove outermost skin layer ; , adult , biopsy ( surgical removal ) small skin sample less 1/4-inch ( 5 mm ) diameter . - Nose swab analyze microbe . - Patients eczema may photograph skin take help monitor skin rash . Participants may contact periodically follow-up study . Patients atopic dermatitis may additional skin sample collect examine change skin bacteria time stag eczema . In addition , patient flare eczema ask undergo skin sample collection soon possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Skin microbiota ( bacteria , fungi , virus , phage , archae ) play significant role common dermatological condition , atopic dermatitis/AD ( eczema ) . - Since culture-dependent method often bias assessment microbial diversity , genomic method expand understand human microbiome skin disease . - Chronic dermatitis typical among rare primary immunodeficiency : Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ; hyper-IgE syndrome ; combine immunodeficiency associate DOCK8 mutation syndrome . The skin disease monogenic disorder resembles AD , associate microbial infection , may provide additional insight microbial-host disease interaction .</detailed_description>
