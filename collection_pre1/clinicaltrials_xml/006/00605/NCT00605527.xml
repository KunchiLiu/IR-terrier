	<brief_title>Understanding Role Genes Biomarkers Blood Clotting Process Children With Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS life-threatening condition involve inflammation lung fluid accumulation air sac , lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . Common cause include pneumonia , sepsis , lung trauma . Symptoms , include breathe difficulty , low blood pressure , organ failure , usually develop within 24 48 hour original injury illness . Most patient require immediate care intensive care unit , main form treatment mechanical ventilation , delivers oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung . Although progress make understanding ALI/ARDS develops , still unknown recovery outcome differ among people . Differences genetic basis protein C fibrinolysis pathway , play role prevent blood clot , may factor determine severity recovery ALI . The purpose study analyze plasma DNA child ALI/ARDS identify biomarkers genetic variation may relate clinical outcome . This study enroll child hospitalize ALI/ARDS . Participants ' medical record review gather information symptom , physical exam finding , mechanical ventilator setting , laboratory test result . A blood collection occur Days 1 3 . Study researcher analyze plasma biomarkers use high throughput DNA sequence technology analyze participant ' DNA .</detailed_description>
