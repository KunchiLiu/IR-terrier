	<brief_summary>This study determine experimental vaccine prevent Ebola virus infection Marburg virus infection safe side effect , , cause . Ebola virus infection may range mild severe , may cause breathe problem , severe bleeding , kidney problem shock lead death . Marburg virus infection cause illness similar cause Ebola virus . The vaccine use study contain genetic material produce laboratory cause body make small amount either Ebola Marburg virus protein . No Ebola Marburg virus vaccine . Normal healthy volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Participants assign receive injection either Marburg Ebola vaccine . The first group participant receive Marburg vaccine second group receive Ebola vaccine . The injection give 4-week interval ( study week 0 , 4 8 ) . They give muscle needleless system call Biojector ( Registered Trademark ) 2000 . Participants keep diary home ( paper electronically ) 5 day , record temperature , symptoms reaction injection site . They call study nurse day vaccination report feel return clinic follow-up 2 week injection ( week 2 , 6 10 ) . The visit include check vital sign , blood urine test , medical history review medication take .

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This open label Phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity two recombinant DNA vaccine : one Marburg virus infection one Ebola virus infection . The hypothesis vaccine safe human administration elicit humoral T cell mediate immune response . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine healthy adult . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine . Product Description : VRC-MARDNA025-00-VP ( Marburg DNA ) compose one closed-circular DNA plasmid encode glycoprotein ( GP ) Angola strain Marburg . VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP ( Ebola DNA WT ) compose two closed-circular DNA plasmid , one encode GP Zaire strain one encode GP Sudan-Gulu strain Ebola . DNA vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use Biojector [ R ] 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) . Subjects : A total 20 healthy adult , age 18-60 year , enrol two group 10 subject . No one subject per group may age range 51-60 year . Study Plan : Subjects sequentially enrol two group . Group 1 subject receive Marburg DNA vaccine Group 2 subject receive Ebola DNA WT vaccine . The first 3 enrollment group occur fast one per day . Before complete enrollment group , study pause review Protocol Safety Review Team ( PSRT ) least 2 week safety follow-up third subject 's first injection . Before initiation Group 2 , FDA must assess administration Ebola DNA WT vaccine safe proceed . In addition , study pause review PSRT least two week safety follow-up last subject enrol Group 1 . VRC 206 Group 1 receive Marburg DNA , accrue 10 subject deliver injection Day 0 dose 4 mg , Day 28 plus minus 7 dose 4 mg Day 56 plus minus 7 dose 4 mg. VRC 206 Group 2 receive Ebola DNA WT , accrue 10 subject deliver injection Day 0 dose 4 mg , Day 28 plus minus 7 dose 4 mg Day 56 plus minus 7 dose 4 mg . The total accrual 20 subject . The injection administer least 21 day DNA injection . The original protocol design require 9 clinic visit 3 telephone follow-up contact subject . The Version 4.0 protocol amendment allow 4th injection consent . Consent administration 4th injection could occur anytime interval start Study Week 32 Study Week 52 . The 4th injection follow-up schedule include 1 telephone contact 4 follow-up visit injection . Study Duration : The original study require 32 week clinical follow participant . Subjects consent amend schedule 4th injection additional 12 week follow .</detailed_description>
