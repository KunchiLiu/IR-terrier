	<brief_summary>The subject symptoms overactive bladder ( many trip bathroom , urgency without inability hold urine get toilet ) invite participate research study . Overactive bladder common sequela long-term bladder outlet obstruction men . Unfortunately , often resolve treatment obstruction ( transurethral resection prostate ) . These patient usually start empirically alpha-blocker occasionally anticholinergic agent , former use treat enlarged prostate medically , latter , treat overactive bladder . We hypothesize patient would significantly improve long-acting anticholinergic agent long act Fesoterodine Toviaz . Earlier study show anticholinergic drug seem beneficial effect symptom patient bladder outlet obstruction overactive bladder . In addition , anticholinergic drug Toviaz associate increased incidence complication like acute urinary retention , state patient unable empty bladder adverse effect drug . A large proportion patient undergoing treatment bladder outlet obstruction also overactive bladder . We propose open label trial evaluate efficacy Toviaz ( fesoterodine ) 4mg 8 mg patient continue symptom overactive bladder one month follow transurethral resection prostate . Toviaz antimuscarinic anticholinergic agent , new formulation Detrol . Patients overactive bladder urodynamic test preoperatively consider . If patient continue symptoms one-month post-operative visit , enrol study . We expect total 25 patient enrol within 4 month . All patient receive Toviaz 4mg 8 mg . The patient follow 3 month post-op , 4 month post-op , 7 month post-op . At post-op visit , patient fill AUA symptom score questionnaire , noninvasive uroflowmetry perform , post-void residual measure bladder scan . Using standard statistical analysis , see difference symptom , post-void residual , maximum flow rate baseline 7 month post-op . We continue study evaluate long-term efficacy , dropout rate , complication . An FDA approve flexible dose regimen allow duration study .</brief_summary>
