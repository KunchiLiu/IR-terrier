	<brief_title>Enteral Nutrition Congestive Heart Failure Cardiac Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac cachexia show powerful independent predictor mortality patient congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Unlike starvation , cachectic CHF patient present decrease muscle and/or fat tissue . This probably depend , least part , level inflammatory activation . Theoretically , seem clear nutritional status improve cardiac cachexia . It suggest inflammatory activation CHF may due endotoxin translocation edematous gut wall . Elevated endotoxin level find patient acutely decompensated CHF , level normalize diuretic treatment . This finding may utmost importance . From one side underscore need aggressive diuretic treatment prevent translocation , another side however , suggest potential area enteral treatment . Enteral route nutrition may highly beneficial diminish bacterial translocation gut and/or endotoxin transfer , finally result low inflammatory activation Numerous experimental study display enteral feeding reduces bacterial translocation , endotoxin absorption positively modulate function local immune tissue . A search literature show little known effectiveness nutritional support functional performance cachectic CHF patient actually report concern influence enteral feeding immune activation cachectic CHF patient . Recent information link exist leptin , increase CHF , inflammatory activation syndrome speculate functional role leptin immune activation CHF . As leptin one important hormone regulation body energy metabolism , think reasonable look also enteral feeding -induced change leptin concomitant fluctuation plasma cytokine . During last 12 month use nutritional support cachectic patient CHF adjunct standard therapy . We surprise significant functional improvement observe many instance . As patient subject aggressive multi-drug diuretic therapy well , impossible appreciate role enteral nutrition respect . We think , observation worth verification control prospective study .</detailed_description>
