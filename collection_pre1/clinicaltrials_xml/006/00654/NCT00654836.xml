	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving carboplatin paclitaxel together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give carboplatin paclitaxel together bevacizumab work treat patient locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Paclitaxel , Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine progression-free survival patient locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer treat carboplatin , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , bevacizumab first-line therapy . Secondary - To determine response rate patient . - To determine overall survival patient . - To evaluate toxicity profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive carboplatin IV 1 hour bevacizumab IV day 1 , 22 43 . Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 ,15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archived tumor tissue sample assess IHC various biomarkers . Levels Notch-1 , Notch-4 , cyclin A , cyclin B , Jagged-1 , DLL4 tumor-associated endothelial cell correlate response estrogen- progesterone-positive negative tumor , independently p53 status . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
