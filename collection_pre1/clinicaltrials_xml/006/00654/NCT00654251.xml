	<brief_summary>Measuring various difficulty patient spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) report accurate manner important able test therapy may develop . As basic research identifies therapy type , clinician plan study either prove disprove treatment actually effect . Walking problem problem eye movement give rise visual complaint common SCA 's . Existing neurological scale `` SARA '' base usual neurological examination item carry degree subjective bias . Also intervals number score often carry `` weight '' difference score 1 2 may equal difference 2 3 . Lastly , scale do clinic setting capture brief period patient 's day . We propose examination home base gait monitoring , time test motor function quantitative measure visual problem patient SCA useful measure disability patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Neurological Impairment Functional Visual Assessment In Spinocerebellar Ataxias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA 's ) relatively rare , inherited disorder cerebellum cause inexorably progressive imbalance incoordination well speech problem . Recent molecular genetic study raise hope meaningful treatment condition . Before one embark therapeutic study SCA 's essential validated instrument measure disease progression . Rating scale base neurological examination report recently sensitivity change reproducibility still examine . In attempt produce readily quantifiable sensitive measure motor function SCA 's , propose examine utility home base gait monitoring , time test motor function quantitative measure visual problem patient SCA 's . These measurement produce continuous rather categorical variable , may subject less arbitrariness part examiner , hypothesize valid measure also sensitive . The overall aim project assess utility home base gait monitoring , time performance measure functional visual testing measure monitor disease progression SCA 's . The concurrent validity measure test correlate establish examination base ataxia scale ( Scale assessment rating ataxia : SARA ) , activity daily live scale ( Barthel index ) functional staging . Aim 1 : Hypothesis : Motor impairment SCA 's assessed validly home set utilizing step activity monitor ( SAM ) . Aim 2 : Hypothesis : Motor impairment SCA 's quantified use performance measure : 9-hole peg board test time 25 foot walk . Aim 3 : Hypothesis : Visual problem report patient SCA 's quantified low contrast vision test , stereoacuity measure , color vision vergence amplitude utilizing well-established ophthalmologic technique . Aim 4 : Hypothesis : The neurological impairment measure measure correlate , score SARA , Barthel index score functional staging . Aim 5 : Hypothesis : Ataxia grade use SAM , time performance measure functional visual score sensitive SARA measure disease progression</detailed_description>
