	<brief_title>Endo-Laparoscopic Approach Versus Conventional Open Surgery Obstructing Left-sided Colon Cancer : RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : First report 1991 , laparoscopic assist colectomy increasingly practise world-wide . Abundant evidence exist literature suggest laparoscopic assist colectomy , compare open counterpart , associate favourable short-term outcome , good cosmesis , good patient 's satisfaction . Moreover , recent report large-scale randomized trial support use minimally invasive technique treatment colorectal cancer , malignant condition common many part world . However , around 8-29 % patient colorectal cancer present acute large bowel obstruction , condition use consider contraindication laparoscopic surgery due poor exposure potential hazard injury distend bowel . Thus , case malignant large bowel obstruction mandate emergency open surgery relieve obstruction resect tumour , many patient , especially obstruct left-sided colon cancer , end temporary permanent stoma adversely affect health-related quality life . Self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) first describe Dohmoto 1991 endoscopic palliative alternative treat inoperable colon cancer . Three year later , Tejero et al . publish preliminary report use SEMS 'bridge ' surgery two patient colonic obstruction 13 . Since , number publication well systemic review show endoluminal stenting relatively simple safe alternative standard surgical management acute malignant obstruction leave colon , thereby obviate need emergency surgery colostomy . However , whether temporary endoscopic bowel decompression SEMS could allow patient malignant leave colonic obstruction undergo successful laparoscopic resection ( endo-laparoscopic approach ) never study detail . We therefore conduct current trial study outcomes endo-laparoscopic approach patient obstruct left-sided colon cancer . Patients Methods : This study randomize control trial design evaluate outcome endo-laparoscopic approach patient obstruct left-sided colon cancer , use patient undergoing emergency open surgery control . Only patient obstruct left-sided colon cancer study report high incidence stoma creation condition10,11 , homogeneous group patient could ensure facilitate comparison two different approach . A single surgical team consist two surgeon ( C.C.C . M.K.W.L . ) one camera assistant case laparoscopic resection perform operation patient general anesthesia . The study approve hospital ethical committee support commercial fund sponsorship .</detailed_description>
