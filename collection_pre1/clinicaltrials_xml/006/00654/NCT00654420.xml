	<brief_summary>This Phase I/IIa study evaluate safety efficacy dalotuzumab ( MK-0646 ) combination erlotinib participant recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The Phase I part study determine high tolerate dose dalotuzumab give combination erlotinib . The primary hypothesis Phase I part study administration erlotinib combination dalotuzumab participant recurrent NSCLC generally well-tolerated evidenced accumulated safety data trial . The Phase II part study investigate well dalotuzumab work conjunction erlotinib treat recurrent NSCLC . The primary hypothesis Phase II part study administration erlotinib combination dalotuzumab participant recurrent NSCLC result improvement Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) compare participant treat erlotinib alone . PFS define time randomization either emergence radiographic evidence disease progression ( documented independent core laboratory ) death due cause , whichever occur first .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dalotuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) target Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor ( IGF-1R ) . Dalotuzumab may act : - Inhibition IGF-1-mediated cell signal cause reduction tumor growth spread - Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity In preclinical study , dalotuzumab improve activity anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mAb activity Erlotinib , small molecule inhibitor EGFR Trial Duration Treatment : Participants continue study long disease progress unmanageable side effect treatment .</detailed_description>
