	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm thyroid cancer metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Patients may receive multiple treatment radioactive iodine , one prior biologic treatment , least half patient prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . At least 3 week must elapse since prior treatment . Measurable disease define least one malignant lesion accurately serially measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) , use caliper ( diameter &gt; 10 mm ) superficial cutaneous disease , use contrastenhanced CT spiral CT ( diameter &gt; 20 mm ) visceral nodal/soft tissue disease . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Appendix 1 ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Adequate organ function determine within 7 day prior enrollment , define : Leucocyte count &gt; 3,000/uL ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl ; Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN , 24hour creatinine clearance &gt; 75 cc/min . ( Note : creatinine clearance need determine baseline serum creatinine within normal limit ) ; Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; serum glutamyloxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 ULN ; alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 time ULN ; PTINR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal . Intellectual , emotional , physical ability comply oral medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Patients disease accessible biopsy preferentially select participation study . Accessible disease include lymph node metastasis .

Use experimental therapy within 3 week prior baseline evaluation do prior enrollment . Patients carcinomatous meningitis exclude study . Excluded therapy medication , previous concomitant : Anticancer chemotherapy immunotherapy study within 4 week prior first dose study drug ; Radiotherapy treatment symptomatic ( e.g . bone metastasis ) clinically indicate allow long evidence progressive disease ( see 4.5.2 ) ; Biological response modifier , GCSF , within 3 week prior study entry . ( GCSF hematopoietic growth factor may use management acute toxicity febrile neutropenia clinically indicate discretion investigator ; however may substitute require dose reduction ) ; Patients take chronic erythropoietin permit provide dose adjustment undertaken within 2 month prior study study ; Investigational drug therapy outside trial within 4 week prior screen assessment ; Use ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir ; Use carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital ; Previous exposure Ras pathway inhibitor ( include herceptin , EGFr inhibitor , farnesyl transferase inhibitor MEK inhibitor ) ; Use grapefruit juice product ; Use cyclosporin ; Pregnant breast feeding .</criteria>
