Subjects eligible regardless whether receive active drug placebo participation previous study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability Activity Oral Fampridine-SR Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under original protocol , patient treatment dose titrate upwards start dose 10mg b.i.d . 15mg b.i.d . stable ( maintenance ) dose 20mg b.i.d . The protocol subsequently revise low maximum maintenance dose . In current protocol , patient down-titrated 10mg b.i.d . maintain dose great part duration study . Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) disorder body 's immune system affect central nervous system ( CNS ) . Normally , nerve fiber carry electrical impulse spinal cord , provide communication brain arm legs . In people MS , fatty sheath surround insulate nerve fiber ( call `` myelin '' ) deteriorate , cause nerve impulse slow stopped . As result , patient MS may experience period muscle weakness symptom numbness , loss vision , loss coordination , paralysis , spasticity , mental physical fatigue decrease ability think and/or remember . These period illness may come ( exacerbation ) go ( remission ) . Fampridine-SR experimental drug report possibly improve muscle strength walk ability people MS . This study evaluate effect possible risk take Fampridine-SR MS patient long period time .</detailed_description>
