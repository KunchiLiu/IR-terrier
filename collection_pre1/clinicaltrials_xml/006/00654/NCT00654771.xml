	<brief_title>Comparison Catheterized Clean Catch Urine Specimens Protein/Creatinine Ratio Preeclampsia Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia new onset hypertension proteinuria twenty week gestation pregnant woman . The gold standard evaluation proteinuria diagnosis preeclampsia twenty-four hour urine collection . However , single-specimen protein/creatinine ratio use detect preeclampsia without delay inconvenience twenty-four hour urine collection would entail . At institution , woman routinely catheterized urine collection protein/creatinine ratio concern vaginal contaminant would falsely elevate protein measurement urine . However , study specifically evaluate whether catheterized urine specimen correlate clean catch urine specimens protein estimation . Thus , purpose prospective study examine whether protein/creatinine ratio catheterize urine specimen correlate clean catch specimen pregnant patient evaluate preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
