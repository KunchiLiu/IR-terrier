	<brief_summary>Intake cocoa-containing food find low blood pressure ( BP ) several clinical trial . It suppose cocoa polyphenols represent active principle , lower BP increase formation vasodilative nitric oxide . However , direct evidence assumption control clinical study lack . Moreover , hypertensive subject vascular dilation appear impaired due endothelial dysfunction vascular smooth muscle remodeling , unclear whether BP response cocoa phenols differs subject high blood pressure optimal blood pressure . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) intake cocoa phenol cause dose-dependent , acute elevation circulate bioactive NO level reduction BP , ( 2 ) NO elevation BP reduction impair patient hypertension . To test hypothesis , investigator conduct prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , sample size-calculated , three-period crossover study pre-planned statistical analysis trial monitoring , cocoa phenol orally administer subject mild essential hypertension subject optimal blood pressure . The effect blood pressure , heart rate , arterial function plasma level cocoa phenol , circulate bioactive nitric oxide , plasma marker oxidative stress evaluate . After 7-day cocoa-free run-in period 12-hour overnight fast , 48 subject ( 24 hypertension 24 sex- , age ( +/- 2yrs ) -matched subject optimal blood pressure ) receive either single dose 1000 mg cocoa polyphenols , 250 mg cocoa phenol placebo ( capsule equal form weight ) . Each intervention follow 7-day cocoa-free washout period cross-over subsequent intervention . Subjects allocate intervention sequence permute block randomization ( i.e . permute block 2 subject high BP 2 subject optimal BP , assign permutation tree intervention ) . Measurements hemodynamic plasma parameter perform directly 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 300 , 480 min capsule administration . Included subject counsel maintain usual diet physical activity abstain cocoa product study . Analysis data perform intention-to-treat basis .</brief_summary>
