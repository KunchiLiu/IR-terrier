	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) kill three million people annually . It estimate one third world 's population latently infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) . Multi-drug resistant strain M.tb , co-infection M.tb HIV present major new challenge . The currently available vaccine , M. bovis BCG , largely ineffective protect adult pulmonary disease endemic area widely agree new effective tuberculosis vaccine major global public health priority1 . However , may unethical impractical test deploy vaccine strategy include BCG , BCG confer worthwhile protection TB meningitis leprosy . An immunisation strategy include BCG also attractive population vaccine candidate need test already immunise BCG . M.tb intracellular organism . CD4+ Th1-type cellular response essential protection increase evidence animal human study CD8+ T cell also play protective role2 . However , generally difficult induce strong cellular immune response human use subunit vaccine . DNA vaccine induce CD4+ CD8+ T cell thus offer potential new approach TB vaccine . DNA vaccine encode various antigen M. tuberculosis evaluate murine model , date DNA vaccine alone show superior BCG . A heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategy involve give two different vaccine , encode antigen , several week apart . Such regime extremely effective induce cellular immune response . Using DNA- prime/MVA-boost immunisation strategy induces high level CD8+ T cell animal model malaria HIV5 , high level CD4+ CD8+ T cell animal model TB . BCG immunisation alone induce CD4+ T cell mice . A prime-boost strategy use BCG prime recombinant MVA encode antigen M.tb also present BCG ( antigen 85A : 'MVA85A ' ) boost , induces much high level CD4+ T cell BCG MVA85A alone . In addition , regime generates specific CD8+ T cell undetectable follow immunisation BCG alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recombinant virus vaccine . Recombinant virus use alone year represent promising vaccine delivery system , particularly induce cellular immune responses8 . The recombinant virus encodes immunise protein peptide . Immunisation recombinant virus vaccine occur host cell take express inoculate attenuated virus encode protective antigen . The expressed protein often native conformation , glycosylation , post-translational modification occur natural infection . Recombinant viral vaccine may elicit antibody cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response , persist without immunisation . Many virus investigate potential recombinant vaccine . The successful worldwide eradication smallpox via vaccination live vaccinia virus highlight vaccinia candidate recombinant use . The recognition recent year non-replicating strain poxvirus MVA avipox vector immunogenic traditional replicating vaccinia strain enhance attractiveness approach . MVA ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara ) strain vaccinia virus passaged 570 time though avian cell , replication incompetent human cell line good safety record . It administer 120,000 vaccinee part smallpox eradication programme , adverse effect , despite deliberate vaccination high risk group . This safety man consistent avirulence MVA animal model . MVA six major genomic deletion compare parental genome severely compromise ability replicate mammalian cell . Viral replication block late infection cell importantly viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired even abortive infection . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA see exceptionally safe viral vector . When test animal model study recombinant MVAs show avirulent , yet protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . The useful data safety efficacy various dos recombinant MVA vaccine come clinical trial data recombinant MVA express number CTL epitopes Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigen fuse complete pre-erythrocytic stage antigen , Thrombospondin Related Adhesion Protein ( TRAP ) . These trial give total 169 immunisation recombinant MVA , 49 UK vaccinee 38 Gambian vaccine ( 20 child age 1-5 ) . 6 dos 1 x 10^7 pfu , 139 dos 5 x 10^7 pfu , 6 dos 1 x 10^8 pfu 18 dos 2.5 x 10^8 pfu administer , without serious adverse effect . Recombinant MVA encode antigen 85A Secreted antigen M. tuberculosis release actively metabolise bacteria , important target protective immunity . Antigen 85A major secrete antigen M. tuberculosis form part antigen 85 complex ( A , B C ) . This complex constitute major portion secrete protein M.tb BCG . It involve fibronectin binding within cell wall mycolyltransferase activity . MVA85A induce CD4+ CD8+ epitope use immunise mouse . When mouse prim BCG give MVA85A boost , level CD4+ CD8+ T cell induce high either BCG MVA85A alone . We evaluate safety immunogenicity follow 3 group : 1 . BCG alone 2 . MVA85A alone 3 . BCG prime-MVA85A boost BCG-BCG provide control group BCG-MVA85A . Many country tradition repeat BCG vaccination criterion revaccination differ country .</detailed_description>
