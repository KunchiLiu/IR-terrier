	<brief_summary>This single institution , open label , phase II study androgen-independent prostate cancer patient chemotherapy-naïve . Patients receive Revlimid® 25 mg daily Days 1-21 follow 7 day rest repeat every 28 day . Treatment continue disease progression , patient 's withdrawal , unacceptable toxicity investigator 's discretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Toxicity &amp; Efficacy Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) Chemotherapy-Naïve AIPC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard care patient androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) debate . Systemic chemotherapy show survival advantage Taxotere-based regimen , therapeutic approach associate significant toxicity morbidity . Furthermore , patient AIPC asymptomatic minimal disease burden make systemic chemotherapy less attractive option . Identifying active agent effective patient population vital importance , may delay need chemotherapy , palliate symptom , delay progression , potentially prolong survival . Acceptable approach set include vaccine therapy , target agent , immunotherapy , non-taxotere base chemotherapeutic program . Targeted therapy particular interest usually avoids side effect chemotherapy attack tumor cell spar normal tissue . Ongoing research continue identify pathways prostate cancer cell become refractory androgen blockade . During development prostate cancer , cell survival depend primarily androgen receptor , bound heat shock protein cytoplasm . The active metabolite testosterone , namely dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) bind receptor relocate nucleus dimerizes , activate transcription gene involve growth survival cancer cell . Plausible etiology development hormone resistance continue cell growth despite adequate castration include change antigen receptor expression , change receptor structure , change androgen receptor function one mechanism contribute resistance . Several investigator show androgen receptor gene gene consistently regulate tumor progression . This increase androgen receptor mRNA protein necessary sufficient convert prostate cancer growth hormone-sensitive hormone-refractory , dependent functional ligand-binding domain . Consequently , one divide mechanism androgen resistance involve androgen receptor not.Pathways involve androgen receptor allow prostate cancer progression amplification mutation receptor , deregulation growth factor cytokine , alteration activator . Amplification androgen receptor gene lead enhance activation receptor even low level androgen . In addition , mutation receptor gene allow activation receptor different ligand . Peptide growth factor , insulin-like growth factor , keratinocyte growth factor , epidermal growth factor , interleukin-6 ( IL 6 ) activate antigen receptor independent androgens.Deregulation apoptotic gene another important pathway AIPC development . PTEN tumor suppressor gene ( Phosphatase Tensin Homologue ) mutate AIPC allow loss inhibitory effect usually exhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway , cause overproduction akt allow cell survival continue . Another deregulate proapoptotic oncogene , namely bcl-2 allows cell survival eventually progression disease . It postulate year tumor need alternative source nutrient outgrow supply . Folkman suggest angiogenic switch take place , accelerate tumor proliferation . Inhibiting tumor proangiogenic factor without affect normal vasculature become attractive theory inhibit tumor growth . Since prostate cancer , like malignancy , require blood vessel formation develop metastasis , find method would disrupt process become paramount importance . Two separate study show elevated level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) correspond advanced stage , progression , poor survival prostate cancer . Since VEGF major regulator angiogenesis ; process increase AIPC since VEGF also correlate increased microvessel density well prognosis , logical step evaluate activity VEGF inhibitor anti-angiogenesis agent AIPC . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) analogue thalidomide demonstrate enhanced immunomodulatory property favorable toxicity profile . The fact AIPC depend angiogenesis lack appropriate immune reaction malignant cell fact Revlimid® exhibit activity inhibit angiogenesis appropriate immunomodulation , make agent attractive option study disease setting.Several investigation suggest activity thalidomide AIPC study patient fail systemic chemotherapy . In addition , Revlimid® show phase I trials safe , less toxic tolerable Thalidomide , potential activity . This study aim evaluate toxicity efficacy Revlimid® AIPC patient chemotherapy-naive .</detailed_description>

Adequate liver function test ALT/AST &lt; 3x normal , total bilirubin 1.5 less , adequate renal function measure creatinine 2.0 mg/dl less . Alkaline phosphatase value never exclusion criterion deem related bone metastasis . 9 . Patients need adequate bone marrow function . ANC 1000 , Hgb 9.0 g/dl , Platelets 100,000 . If cause affect plts count autoimmune disorder , patient allow study . Patients inadequate bone marrow function deem related bone marrow involvement prostate cancer allow investigator 's discretion . 10 . Patients malignancy allow long evidence malignancy present entry time , 3 year since treatment disorder complete . 11 . Patients prior exposure investigational therapy include vaccine allow study long last exposure 4 week prior study entry . Erlotinib exposure GMCSF exclusion criterion consider chemotherapy . 12 .
