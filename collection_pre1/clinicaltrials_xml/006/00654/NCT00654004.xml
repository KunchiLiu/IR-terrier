	<brief_summary>Several hormone involve body weight regulation increase subject 's ability burn fat energy . The purpose study investigate burning fat energy may affect hormone body weight child . The study also determine eat diet high protein alters amount fat burn hormone control body weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders &amp; Body Weight Regulation Grant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A role mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation peripheral signal cascade leptin , adiponectin insulin recently propose animal study investigate human . Children trifunctional protein ( TFP , include deficiency long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ) long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency , inherited disorder long-chain fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation , lack ability oxidize fatty acid energy . They increase level body fat circulate leptin high incidence obesity . Current therapy child disorder base frequent meal consume low fat , high carbohydrate diet . Despite treatment , exercise induced rhabdomyolysis common complication TFP VLCAD deficiency frequently lead exercise avoidance . The effect genetic defect body composition weight regulation investigate . The contribution fatty-acid oxidation moderate intensity exercise child also report . Two group subject recruit : one group subject long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder ( n=13 ) . The group group control ( n=16 ) . We study peripheral signal body weight regulation , glucose tolerance , body composition , exercise metabolism subject long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder compare normal control .</detailed_description>
