	<brief_summary>We propose develop personalize pharmacogenetic approach include major genetic marker warfarin ( coumadin ) dose patient ' age weight . The known genetic determinant include several functional common polymorphism CYP2C9 VKORC1 gene , explain low-end warfarin dose range mostly occur patient Caucasian Chinese origin . We identify new VKORC1 polymorphism specifically indicative high dose requirement dominant dose-reducing effect know CYP2C9 VKORC1 marker . This marker significantly over-represented Jews Ethiopian origin , also common Ashkenazis , also link VKORC1 genetic marker characteristic Afro-American population ( publish Blood 2007 , 109:2477-80 ) . This information prompt development inclusive universal diagnostic approach individualize warfarin therapy . The present study aim evaluation novel pharmacogenetic model predict warfarin ( coumadin ) dose response basis patient 's genetic marker warfarin sensitivity resistance , patient specific factor . To end , propose re-evaluate previously develop pharmacogenetic model stabilize warfarin treat patient ( N=200 ) implement prospective study patient new warfarin compare `` traditionally '' treat patient ( N=500 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Study Warfarin Dose-Response : Prospective Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To date , warfarin-related pharmacogenetic study cross-sectional retrospective association study . There prospective study design evaluate impact genotype-guided compare `` traditional '' trial error approach currently use clinical practice . The present study design prospectively evaluate impact combine pharmacogenetic warfarin dose prediction model safety efficacy warfarin treatment community base setting . Specific Aims : 1 . To develop validate genotype-based prediction model warfarin dose optimization . 2 . To prospectively compare anticoagulation quality clinical outcome genotype-guided warfarin dose patient versus `` traditional '' dose patient . Study Design : The study perform Molecular Lab Institute Human Genetics , Sheba Medical Center collaboration Maccabi Health Care facility , Israel . Study I : A cross sectional study develop validate genotype-based prediction warfarin dose model , include two hundred ( 200 ) unselected patient steady-state warfarin anticoagulation define stable therapeutic INR 's ( ±10 % ) achieve stable warfarin dos ( ±10 % ) 3 month identify Maccabi database . Informed consent obtain treat physician also document demographic clinical data include age , gender , body weight , ethnic background , indication warfarin treatment , additional medical problem concomitant medication appropriate form ( included CRF ) . A 5cc fresh whole blood sample drawn patient next routine INR monitoring venepuncture anonymization , deliver Genetics laboratory DNA extraction genotyping . Genetic analysis include multiplex analysis least 10 polymorphism associate warfarin dose response perform use Sequenom Mass Spectrograph technology ( CYP2C9*1/*2/*3 , VKORC1*1/*2/*3/*4 , VKORC1 Asp36Tyr , CALU Arg4Glu EPHX1 Tyr113His ) . Data analysis include multiple regression analysis employ data create accurate prediction model individual therapeutic warfarin steady-state maintenance dose ( dependent variable ) function demographic variable genotype group ( independent variable ) . The accuracy prediction model cross-validated previous data warfarin-treated patient steady state . Study II : A prospective control trial compare laboratory clinical anticoagulation outcomes genotype-guided warfarin dose patient versus `` traditionally '' dose patient , include five hundred ( 500 ) patient commence warfarin therapy standard indication confirm informed consent recruit Maccabi physician ( receive training session prior study ) time 1st Maccabi laboratory INR monitoring visit . Demographic clinical data record . Patients randomly assign one two dose group : ( 1 ) genotype-guided warfarin dose group ( N=250 ) ; ( 2 ) traditional dose group ( N=250 ) .A single 5cc fresh whole blood sample drawn venepuncture use INR determination , DNA extraction anonymized genotyping . Genetic analysis include immediate analysis 4 significant marker warfarin dose response ( CYP2C9*1/*2/*3 , VKORC1*2 haplotype VKORC1 Asp36Tyr ) perform use Real Time PCR PRONTO methodology . Controlled trial : For patient genotype-dosing group Maccabi physicians receive dose recommendation base prediction model validate study I , within 48 hour . Genotype-based dosing recommendation subject change treat physician base clinical judgment . All dose-recommendation change record analyzed . Patients assign traditional dosing group dose Maccabi physician accord accepted clinical practice , ( use repeat INR measurement warfarin dose change require physician judgment ) . For standardization purpose , warfarin dose adjustment carry accord predefined algorithm . All patient follow achieve stable anticoagulation , define 3 schedule visit anticoagulation clinic follow program within least 12 week . Each follow visit include short interview , INR measurement warfarin dose schedule include time next visit . At visit follow data record : major active medical problem , INR value next warfarin daily dose , use change concurrent medication , dietary intake change possible explanation inadequate ( excessive ) anticoagulation , change schedule warfarin daily dos occurrence minor major bleed episode . Data analysis : Efficiency safety warfarin anticoagulation compare two study group apply appropriate statistical method follow outcome variable : 1 . Mean number visit recruitment stable anticoagulation . 2 . Mean number INR measurement require recruitment stable anticoagulation . 3 . Proportion visit excessive INR value ( upper limit therapeutic INR value ) . 4 . Proportion visit INR value low limit therapeutic INR value ) . 5 . Number require change warfarin daily dos study period . 6 . Number major minor bleeding episode . Patient Benefit : Participating patient benefit early delivery treat physician information relevant genetic propensity require high , intermediate low warfarin dos , possible shortening time treatment titration possible decrease likelihood experience dose-related complication . There envisaged harm recruit patient . Organizational Benefit : Positive result implement proof concept , project develop user-friendly point-of-care pharmacogenetic diagnostic technology .
