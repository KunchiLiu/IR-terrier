	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Prior definitive treatment radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy ( external beam brachytherapy ) . Patients may receive post prostatectomy radiation therapy adjuvant set biochemical recurrence . Hormone sensitive prostate cancer evidence serum total testosterone level within institution 's normal range £4 week registration . ( Patients may receive hormonal therapy adjuvant set provide last dose ³ one year date enrollment . ) All patient must evidence biochemical progression determine 3 PSA measure . ( PSA2 , PSA1 PSA 0 ) The recent PSA value ( PSA0 ) serve baseline . All PSA value must obtain reference lab early ( PSA2 ) ≥ eight week prior registration , ≤ six month prior enrollment . The recent PSA value ( PSA 0 ) must draw £ seven day treatment must great 0.4 ng/ml ( prostatectomy ) great ³1.5 ng ml ( radiation therapy ) time registration . The patient must high risk develop distant metastasis one follow criterion : Gleason score 810 original tumor specimen Prostate specific antigen doubling time ( PSADT ) less nine month calculate use follow formula PSADT day = 0.693 ( ) ln ( PSA1 ) ln ( PSA2 ) = number day PSA 2 PSA1 PSA1 recent PSA value PSA2 next recent PSA value Ln = natural log PSADT month = PSADT divide 30.4 Age &gt; 18 year old ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow : Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN ALT AST &lt; 2.5 time ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN INR &lt; 1.5 PT/PTT within normal limit patient therapeutic anticoagulation . Patients receive anticoagulation treatment agent warfarin heparin may allow participate . For patient warfarin , INR measure prior initiation Sorafenib monitor least weekly , define local standard care , INR stable . Men agree use adequate birth control least three month last administration Sorafenib . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . A sign informed consent must obtain prior study specific procedure . Consideration must give definitive local therapy ; patient may either refuse consider candidate . Therapy modulate testosterone level ( leuteinizinghormone release hormone agonists/antagonists antiandrogens ) treatment biochemical recurrence prostate cancer . Treatment neoadjuvant set permissible great 1 year prior registration . Agents 5 alpha reductase inhibitor , ketoconazole , megestrol acetate , systemic steroid , herbal supplement know affect PSA ( PC Spes , saw palmetto oil ) permit time period PSA value collect screen treatment Evidence measurable evaluable metastatic disease chest xray bone scan CT scan perform ≤ four week registration . Patients must receive investigational agent concurrent anti cancer therapy £4 week treatment . Cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA . Patients must unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) new onset angina ( begin ≤ last 3 month ) myocardial infarction ≤ past 6 month . Cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy . Known brain metastasis . Patients neurological symptom must undergo CT scan/MRI brain exclude brain metastasis . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg , despite optimal medical management . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection chronic Hepatitis B C. HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Sorafenib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study may undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy future Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 . Thrombolic embolic event cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ≤ past 6 month . Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 £4 week registration . Any hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 3 £ 4 week registration . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy Major surgery , open biopsy significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 week registration . Concurrent use cytochrome P450 enzyme induce antiepileptic drug ( phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital ) , rifampin St Johns Wort . Patients must discontinue medication ³14 day start protocol therapy Known suspect allergy Sorafenib agent give course trial . Any condition impair patient 's ability swallow whole pill . Any malabsorption problem . Prior history cancer ( except basal cell squamous cell skin cancer ) ≤ past five year .</criteria>
