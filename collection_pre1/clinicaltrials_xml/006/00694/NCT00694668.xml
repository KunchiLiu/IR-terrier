Data-analysis/power : Based previous study least medium effect treatment repetition DSH may expect . Assuming medium effect one treatment compare TAU ( delta =.75 ) attrition rate 20 % , least 42 patient per study arm need detect minimal clinical relevant difference repetition DSH power 80 % alpha set .05 .</brief_summary>
