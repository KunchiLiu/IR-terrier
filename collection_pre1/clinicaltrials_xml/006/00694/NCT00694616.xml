	<brief_title>Prevalence Metabolic Syndrome Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Effect Treatment With Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( Auto-CPAP ) Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) condition collapse upper airway sleep , result decrease complete cessation airflow . This lead repeat episode hypoxia sleep sleep fragmentation . OSA highly prevalent though under-recognized clinical problem . The Wisconsin study estimate prevalence 24 % male 9 % female . A population-based study Delhi , India find prevalence OSA 13.7 % obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) 3.8 % . OSA associate various systemic complication neurocognitive dysfunction , cardiovascular disease , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia . There increase risk motor vehicle occupational accident people suffer OSAS . Metabolic syndrome co-occurrence several cardiovascular risk factor abdominal obesity , hypertension , impair glucose tolerance dyslipidemia . Presence OSA together metabolic syndrome know 'Syndrome Z ' . Although many study show OSA associate metabolic syndrome , exact causal relationship two entity proven . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) standard treatment OSA significant symptom . However , costly treatment option , poor compliance important limit factor . CPAP treatment show improve daytime somnolence neurocognitive function people OSAS . However , effect metabolic syndrome people OSAS unclear . This study aim assess effect CPAP treatment metabolic syndrome patient OSAS .</detailed_description>
