	<brief_summary>This exploratory clinical study design obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessment 20 evaluable patient metastatic renal cell cancer ( RCC ) early post therapy assessment baseline various early time point ( 1 week 5 patient , 2 week 5 patient , 3 week 5 patient 4 week 5 patient ) institution standard approve sunitinib therapy 37.5 mg/day . The clinical imaging biomarkers include assessment tumor metabolism [ Bannasch 1986 , Frauwirth 2002 , Garber 2006 , Kelloff 2005 , Pauwels 1998 , Semenza 2001 , Smith 1999 , Smith 2000 , Sokoloff 1977 , Warburg 1956 , Weber 1977A , Weber 1977B ] ( dynamic FDG-PET ) ; tumor proliferation [ Rasey 2002 , Shields 2001 , Shields 1998 , Vesselle 2002 , Schwartz 2003 ] ( dynamic FLT-PET ) ; tumor blood flow ( H215O-PET , DCE MRI ) [ Lodge 2000 ] , tumor perfusion ( DCE-MRI ) [ Tofts 1999 , Tofts 1997 , Parker 1999 ] ; tumor blood volume ( H215O-PET , DCE MRI ) [ Lodge 2000 , Tofts 1999 , Tofts 1997 ] patient baseline patient one post therapy time point ( 1 week , 2 week , 3 week 4 week ) . We hypothesize use set image assessment possible determine individual likely set image derived biomarkers accomplish several goal initiative provide funding study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our propose clinical study : - Provide exploratory yet reliable validated cadre image study do patient yield mechanistically-based understanding : 1 ) predictive assay clinical benefit standard sunitinib therapy , 2 ) measurement efficacy standard sunitinib therapy , 3 ) prognosis long term outcome . - Reveal detailed understanding vivo mechanism standard sunitinib therapy patient tumor , mechanistic information particular functional imaging pattern see treated patient , clinical measure useful physician decision make explanation efficacy outcomes patient . - Predict patient may benefit standard sunitinib therapy . - Determine early course treatment whether standard sunitinib therapy efficacious whether used future comparable patient . - Show outcome patient standard sunitinib treatment . - Shed information biological mechanism rapid decrease FDG uptake FDG-PET image standard sunitinib treatment . It hypothesis set biologically relevant image biomarkers ( tumor metabolism assess dynamic FDG-PET ; tumor proliferation assess dynamic FLT-PET ; tumor blood flow assess H215O-PET DCE MRI ) ; tumor perfusion assess DCE-MRI ; tumor blood volume/volume distribution assess H215O-PET DCE MRI ) patient baseline patient one post therapy time point ( 1 week , 2 week , 3 week 4 week ) provide either alone likely combination information predict patient likely benefit standard sunitinib therapy early response assessment possible predictive durable response therapeutic drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 18 year old inclusion study . Since experience [ F18 ] FLT child would inappropriate study individual age 18 safety data available . After entry study , patient expect follow least 2 month part standard care . All patient , legal guardian , must sign write informed consent HIPAA authorization accordance institutional guideline . The patient , female , must postmenopausal minimum one year surgically sterile , one follow method birth control minimum one month prior entry study : IUD , oral contraceptive , DepoProvera Norplant . These criterion waive discretion investigator patient 's tumor consider life threaten one month wait require best interest patient . Negative pregnancy test accept . Pretreatment laboratory test patient receive [ F18 ] FLT must perform within 21 day prior study entry . These must less 4 time upper low limit range respective laboratory test . These include liver enzyme ( SGOT , SGPT , ALK Phos , GGT , LDH ) , bilirubin ( direct total ) , amylase , serum electrolyte , CBC platelets absolute neutrophil count , prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , BUN , creatinine , urinalysis . Pretreatment radiological clinical scans/studies ( Gd enhance MRI CT document metastatic renal cell carcinoma ) must perform within 30 day study entry . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical Gd use MRI image . Patients significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion . Patients pregnant lactate suspect might pregnant . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET MRI scan . HIV positive patient due previous toxicity note FLT . Renal Insufficiency Exclusion MRI contrast injection . All subject screen renal status patient renal insufficiency exclude undergoing dynamic contrast enhance MRI scan . This response recent association MRI contrast agent development Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) . The patient creatinine value determine within 4 week prior propose MRI scan GFR determine creatinine value data use various website determine GFR . If GFR great 60 ml/min/then patient deem eligible contrast injection . If GFR value 40 ml/min 60 ml/min risk versus benefit perform contrast injection discuss refer physician patient . If GFR le 40 ml/min dynamic contrast study perform . The noncontrast MRI scan however obtain anatomic reference PET study . MRI exclusion criterion : Presence ferromagnetic metallic implant foreign body , include pacemaker certain type stent orthopedic hardware . Claustrophobia inability remain stationary within MRI system ~3045 minute . Inability breath hold period least 20 second . Known history adverse reaction Gd chelate contrast agent . Pregnancy breastfeed . Nonimageable tumor , include tumor small dimension le 10mm tumor locate region excessively affect susceptibility artifact bone airtissue interface motion artifact due peristalsis pulsatile flow .</criteria>
