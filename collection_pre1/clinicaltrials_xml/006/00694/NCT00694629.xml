	<brief_summary>Protocol Synopsis The goal Phase 2 clinical trial evaluate antimicrobial activity safety experimental intensive phase ( first 8 week treatment ) tuberculosis treatment regimen rifapentine substitute rifampin . Primary Objective - To compare antimicrobial activity safety standard daily regimen comprise rifampin ( approximately 10 mg/kg/dose ) + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol ( RHZE ) experimental regimen comprise rifapentine ( approximately 10 mg/kg/dose ) + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol ( PHZE ) . Secondary Objectives - To determine compare regimen time culture-conversion , use data 2- , 4- , 6- , 8-week culture ( 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 dos ) . - To determine compare regimen proportion patient Grade 3 4 adverse reaction - To determine correlation MGIT/BACTEC liquid culture growth index mycobacterial clinical biomarkers time culture conversion treatment failure - To store serum future assessment biomarkers TB treatment response hypersensitivity study drug . - To compare adverse event 2-month culture conversion rate among HIV-infected patient vs. HIV-uninfected patient - To determine tolerability safety , estimate antimicrobial activity , experimental regimen include isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol plus either rifapentine 15 mg/kg/dose rifapentine 20 mg/kg/dose , administer daily . Assessment dos rifapentine perform extension main study enrollment main study complete . Design This prospective , multicenter , open-label clinical study . Adults suspect pulmonary tuberculosis meet eligibility criterion randomize receive either experimental intensive phase tuberculosis treatment regimen standard intensive phase tuberculosis treatment regimen . Randomization stratify presence/absence cavitation baseline chest radiograph , geographic continent . All dos study drug give direct observation administer 5 day per week . After subject completes intensive phase therapy , he/she treat non-experimental continuation phase tuberculosis treatment regimen . The study extension prospective , multicenter clinical trial . Eligibility criterion main study . Participants randomize one four regimen : standard intensive phase treatment regimen , investigational regimen rifapentine 10 mg/kg/dose substitute rifampin , investigational regimen rifapentine 15 mg/kg/dose substitute rifampin , investigational regimen rifapentine 20 mg/kg substitute rifampin . Randomization stratify presence/absence cavitation baseline chest radiograph , study site . Study drug administer 7 day per week . After subject completes intensive phase therapy , he/she treat non-experimental continuation phase tuberculosis treatment regimen . Subjects blood drawn one pharmacokinetic determination rifapentine concentration week 2 visit intensive phase therapy . This study conduct 2 phase . 1 . The main study compare 10 mg/kg dose rifapentine , open label , 10 mg/kg rifampin otherwise standard intensive phase regimen treatment pulmonary tuberculosis . The projected sample size 480 enrollment ; 530 patient actually enrol . 2 . The study extension evaluate high dos rifapentine , specific rifapentine dos ( 10 mg/kg , 15 mg/kg , 20 mg/kg ) blind patient clinician , data collection endpoint otherwise similar main study . The projected sample size study extension 320 enrollment .</brief_summary>
