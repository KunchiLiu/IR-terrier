	<brief_title>Non-Operative Management High Grade Blunt Hepatic Injury : Clinical Complications Role Collateral Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Modern approach liver injure patient favour non-operative management liver injury ( NOMLI ) include endovascular artery occlusion . Numerous study past two decade confirm feasibility NOMLI 95 % hemodynamically stable patient blunt trauma mechanism . To improve outcome patient hepatic injury , investigation focus overall morbidity mortality NOMLI . Purely hepatic-related complication rate series low , range 0-7 % parallel grade liver lesion . But majority patient include study suffer low-grade liver injury ( LI ) . Regarding safety NOMLI high grade lesion , result may bias . Complications patient high-grade LI frequent management considerably complex . Regarding sparsely available literature focus morbidity NOMLI high grade LI , hepatic-related complication rate 11 13 % described . Only LI grade amount pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfusion 24 hour postinjury predict hepatic-related complication . No data available concern impact collateral intra- extra-abdominal damage complication NOMLI patient . Of note , 75 % patient LI suffer collateral intra- extra-abdominal lesion . These injury vary surgical importance severe complication LI independent laparotomy must expect significant number patient . Rates nonspecific laparotomy describe 20 % patient hepatic trauma . Over past decade , overall mortality liver injure patient remain relatively constant , average 10-15 % . This mortality rate represent deaths cause clinical course complex trauma patient . There study already suggest , early death patient LI also cause uncontrolled bleeding associate intra- extra-abdominal injury , late death result collateral head injury sepsis multi-organ-failure ( MOF ) . But detailed data occurrence extra-abdominal complication NOMLI publish far . Objective : We first hypothesize NOMLI safely achieve also high-grade liver injured patient , management trauma patient LI mainly consist treatment collateral damage complication , cause death majority case liver relate . A retrospective study involve 183 patient blunt hepatic injury therefore carry investigate hypothesis . Methods : The study conduct Bern University Hospital , Switzerland January 2000 December 2006 . An average 286 ( range , 204-344 ) multiple injured patient treat level I trauma centre year . Only blunt liver injured patient include . All chart ( include surgery autopsy report ) review retrospectively . Demographic data collect included age , gender , mechanism injury . Injury pattern define Abbreviated Injury Score ( AIS ) Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) . The grade hepatic injury determine experienced radiologist two experience hepatobiliary surgeon parallel base contrast enhance compute tomography ( CT ) scan finding ( SiemensÂ® Somatom Sensation 16 ) laparotomy accord American Association Surgery Trauma Organ Injury Scale hepatic injury . For current study , high-grade injury consider grade 3 5 . Other data collect include number type surgical procedure , hepatic-related overall complication , cause death .
