	<brief_title>Lapatinib Circulating Tumor Cells Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer consider systemic disease since early tumour cell dissemination may occur even patient small tumour ; several investigator use immunocytochemistry real time PCR ( RT-PCR ) show cytokeratin-positive epithelial cell could identify bone marrow aspirate peripheral blood otherwise metastases-free patient stage I II breast cancer . The clinical importance immunocytochemical detection occult tumour cell bone marrow confirm many prospective study represent independent predictive prognostic factor distant relapse reduce survival . Patients metastatic breast cancer persistent detection tumour cell peripheral blood ( ≥5 cells/7.5 ml ) despite least one line chemotherapy receive lapatinib minimum one month unless disease progression occur early time point .</detailed_description>
