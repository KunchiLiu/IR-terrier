	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Patients newly diagnose superficial transitional cell carcinoma completely resect papillary tumor high probability recurrence risk i.e . stage T1 Grade 2 , T1 Grade 3 &amp; CIS . Ta T1 disease increase risk recurrence define 2 tumor ( primary recurrent 2 recurrence ) within 1 year , 3 within last 6 month and/ carcinoma situ least one random biopsy . 18 year ECOG 02 range life expectancy least 24 week . Absolute neutrophil count≥1,500/c.mm platelet count≥100,000//c.mm Hemoglobin ≥9.0g/dL No patient eczema allow participate study . Patients immunocompromised enrolled . Patients severe hepatic dysfunction evidence Cirrhosis enrol . Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus enrol study No evidence residual tumor cystoscopy do 6 week TUR Note : The effect Investigational product develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman child bear potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients cytotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy prior enter study . No patient eczema allow participate study . Patients immunocompromised enrolled . Patients severe hepatic dysfunction evidence Cirrhosis enrol . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition agent use study . Pregnant woman nurse woman exclude study agent use study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because know potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother investigational agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated investigational product . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Hypersensitivity celecoxib , sulfonamide , aspirin , NSAIDs , study reagent Previous splenectomy Clinically significant active infection Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus .</criteria>
