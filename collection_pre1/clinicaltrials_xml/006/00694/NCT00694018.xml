	<brief_title>Veterans Walk Beat Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Background/Rationale : Chronic pain , especially back pain , common among VA patient , affect approximately 60 % veteran use VA primary care service . Chronic pain associate increased disability , poor health status , anxiety depression , decrease quality life , decreased employment increase health service use cost . Current evidence suggest exercise one effective strategy manage chronic pain . However , clinical program use generally available tool relatively low cost approach help patient chronic back pain initiate maintain exercise program . Project Objectives : The primary objective study assess efficacy Internet-mediated pedometer base intervention design increase walk improve pain-related function among individual chronic back pain . The Specific Aims randomize , control trial : 1 ) To determine whether internet-mediated pedometer base intervention reduce pain-related functional interference among patient chronic back pain short term 12-month timeframe ; 2 ) To assess effect intervention walking ( measured step count ) , quality life , pain intensity , pain related fear self-efficacy exercise among patient chronic back pain ; 3 ) To identify factor associate sustained increase walk 12-month timeframe among patient randomize intervention . Project Methods : We conduct randomize controlled trial Internet-mediated , pedometer base intervention promote walk improve pain-related function among patient chronic back pain compare enhance usual care . Participants follow 12 month investigate efficacy intervention assist patient initiate maintain regular walk program improve pain-related function . We recruit patient chronic back pain ( primarily low back pain ) receive care one VA health care system . Study patient randomize one two group : 1 ) enhance usual care 2 ) Internet-mediated , pedometer base intervention . All participant attend educational program design specifically individual chronic back pain . Study participant randomize intervention give enhance pedometer access study website provide step goal feedback , tailor motivational message e-community . Those control group receive pedometer access website . Both group complete on-line survey assessment baseline , 6 , 12 month ask report adverse event regular basis . The primary outcome study pain-related functional interference . Secondary outcome include average daily step 12 month measure use study pedometer , health relate quality life , pain intensity , pain related fear self-efficacy exercise . The analysis conduct base intention treat principle use multivariable modeling procedure determine effect intervention outcome .</detailed_description>
