	<brief_title>Effects Re-Feeding Duration Weight Maintenance After Weight Loss With Very-Low-Energy Diets ( VLEDs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VLED program : During initial 12 week , patient encourage follow strict liquid very-low-energy diet ( 470-820 kcal ) . They select pay one follow commercially available diet ; Modifast® ( 820 kcal ) , Nutrilett® ( 560 kcal ) Cambridgekuren® ( 470 kcal ) . Free consumption non-caloric drink ( &lt; 6 kcal/100 g ) allow . All patient schedule nurse visit week 0 ( baseline ) , 2 , 5 , 8 , 12 . Body weight registered visit patient give support counsel enhance VLED compliance . Side effect monitor frequent contact offer need . All patient encourage physically active . Dietary treatment : Following VLED , dietary treatment advice give individual dietician counseling nine study visit ( week 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 26 , 32 , 38 , 44 , 52 ) . At week 12 , dietician assign patient ≥10 % weight loss treatment group accord randomization . Standardized write oral instruction one six week re-feeding provide ; hence , participant well study staff aware group assignment . During re-feeding , ordinary meal gradually re-introduced VLED portion remove . Patients one week re-feeding ( Group 1 ) ( instruct week 12 ) start breakfast three day , add lunch ( dinner ) next four day , thereafter third meal re-introduced VLED discontinued . Patients six week re-feeding ( Group 6 ) ( instruct week 12 , 15 , 18 ) start one regular meal ( patient 's choice ) three week . A second meal add next three week , week eight third meal re-introduced VLED discontinued . For group between-meal snack ( e.g . fruit ) recommend completion re-feeding period . Recommended energy intake base estimate energy requirement minus 30 % achieve energy-reduced level . Energy requirement calculate equation Harris-Benedict estimation basal metabolic rate , adjust factor 1.3 total energy expenditure ( moderate level physical activity ) . Recommended energy distribution breakfast , lunch dinner 20 , 35 35 % daily energy intake , 10 % snack . Dietary prescription follow Swedish Nutrition Recommendations . All patient encourage increase level physical activity . Power calculation randomization : Sample size calculation base data similar study . A sample size 75 patient per treatment arm derive , assume 80 % power detect 4 kg weight loss difference , SD 7 kg , statistical significance level P &lt; 0.05 , 35 % dropout week 12 52 . Two-hundred sixty-nine patient start VLED regimen , 12 week eligible randomization lose ≥10 % initial body weight . The randomization stratify combination sex degree weight loss ( strictly great less 17.1 % weight loss ) . Eligible patient randomly assign within four stratum one two treatment ( one six week re-feeding ) block size two , equal allocation treatment within block . The randomization list generate pseudo-random number generator , result treatment sequence reproducible unpredictable . The treatment allocation order arrange number , seal envelope keep separate box stratum . At patient assignment , envelope next order drawn appropriate stratum box .</detailed_description>
