Patient Characteristics : Age : 18 complete year Performance status : ECOG 02 Life expectancy : At least 24 week Hematopoietic : Hemoglobin â‰¥ 9.0 g/dL Comorbidity No patient eczema allow participate study . Patients immunocompromised enrolled . Patients severe hepatic dysfunction evidence Cirrhosis enrol . Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus enrol study . Note : The effect Investigational product develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman child bear potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients cytotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy prior enter study . Intractable urinary tract infection . No patient eczema allow participate study . Patients immunocompromised enrolled . Patients severe hepatic dysfunction evidence Cirrhosis enrol . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition agent use study . Pregnant woman nurse woman exclude study agent use study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because know potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother investigational agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated investigational product .
