	<brief_summary>This research study test safety vaccination cell call GM-K562 cell mixed participant irradiated tumor cell . The GM-K562 cell modify laboratory secrete protein GM-CSF . This protein effective stimulate immune response cancer . This newly develop vaccine may stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination With Lethally Irradiated Glioma Cells Mixed With GM-K562 Cells Patients Undergoing Craniotomy For Recurrent Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants undergo craniotomy ( brain surgery ) remove much tumor possible brain . A pathologist examine tissue determine whether cell viable . If , able make vaccine participant eligible proceed treatment protocol . - The dose vaccine determine number tumor cell able collect surgery . We also try determine appropriate number GM-K562 cell give safely . We assign group participant different dose level GM-K562 . - For first three week study , vaccine give week . After first three week , vaccine give every week . - Before first fourth vaccination , small amount participant irradiated tumor cell injected skin see immune system react . If participant develop rash , may ask undergo small skin biopsy additional evaluation . These biopsy optional . - During course study , also collect blood sample evaluate effect vaccination may immune system . These test do every month . - Participants MRI every two month . - The following test procedures do participant receive vaccine every two week ( During first month , perform Days 1 , 3 4 , 15 , 29 31 32 ) : medical history ; physical exam ; vital sign ; neurological exam ; routine blood test ; research blood test .</detailed_description>
