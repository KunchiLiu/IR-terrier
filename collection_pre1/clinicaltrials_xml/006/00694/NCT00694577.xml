	<brief_title>Partial Breast Irradiation ( PBI ) Selected Patients With Early Invasive Non-Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In study , radiotherapy give portion breast around tumor bed use external radiation treatment . This approach call `` partial breast irradiation '' . - Participants undergo plan session radiation treatment . This plan do CT scan day week start treatment . This planning process use plan conventional radiation therapy treatment . - Radiation therapy begin 4-12 week last surgery breast individual receive chemotherapy first . For individual receive chemotherapy radiation therapy , radiation therapy start 2-6 week end chemotherapy . - We study three level radiation dose see best . The dose participant receives depend upon enrol trial . - Participants receive radiation treatment twice day 4 5 treatment day , overall treatment time one week .</detailed_description>
