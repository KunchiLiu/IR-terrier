	<brief_summary>Pilot Immunotherapy Study Combination Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen ( PSMA ) T-cell receptor Î³ alternate reading frame protein ( TARP ) Peptide With Poly IC-LC Adjuvant Human Leukocyte Antigens ( HLA ) -A2 ( + ) Patients With Elevated prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) After Initial Definitive Treatment The purpose study see PSMA/TARP protein vaccine , along Hiltonol , arouse train immune system kill prostate cancer cell . Prostate cancer common cancer second lead cause cancer death U.S. male . It curable confine prostate ( kept spread ) use surgery radiation treatment . In patient cancer come back treatment . Treatment option prostate cancer come back include procedure medication may significant risk side effect . Another plan look use body 's immune system attack prostate cancer cell . A vaccine developed protein find prostate cancer cell . One proteins call PSMA call TARP . In addition protein , another substance call Poly IC-LC ( Hiltonol ) add vaccine boost ability start immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed Objectives : 1 . Estimate frequency immunological efficacy vaccine comparison vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISpot ) test result , antigen ( PSMA , TARP ) peripheral blood specimen collect period time define `` '' , `` '' `` '' vaccination . 2 . Study safety toxicity vary dos polypeptide vaccine : PSMA27-35-PSMA687-701 ( VLAGGFFLLYRHVIYAPSSHNKYA ) TARP13-35 ( LQLLKQSSRRLEHTFMFLRNFSL ) administer fix dose Poly IC-LC ( 2 mg total/treatment ) adjuvant . 3 . Describe impact vaccine pattern PSA change 2 subset patient : castrate testosterone ; non-suppressed testosterone level/not hormone therapy . 4 . Identify basis selection dose PSMA TARP polypeptide vaccine future phase II development vaccination strategy , consider dose range test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History histologically confirm prostate cancer . Competence understand patient information provide write informed consent , willingness ability return H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center plan treatment followup . Absence evidence metastatic disease current physical exam current imaging study ( compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] pelvis , bone scan within 60 day first treatment ) . Patients hormone therapy ( stratum `` N '' ) must meet : 1 . At least 1 year prostatectomy , definitive prostate radiation , definitiveintent local therapy . 2 . No testosterone suppression therapy least 6 month . 3 . PSA least 1 ng/ml , 2 measurement , least 2 week apart . 4 . Testosterone level &gt; 100 ng/ml , start ( `` noncastrate '' ) . Patients hormone therapy ( stratum `` Y '' ) must meet : 1 . On treatment gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist ( orchiectomy ) least 6 month . 2. testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/ml , start . 3 . PSA least 1 ng/ml , 2 measurement , least 2 week apart . Laboratory value obtain 014 day prior start therapy : 1 . White blood count ( WBC ) 3,500/micro L. 2 . Platelet count 100,000 micro L. 3 . Hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL . 4 . Serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL . 5 . Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 6 . Aspartic transaminase ( AST ) 2.5 x ULN . Life expectancy least 6 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Known standard therapy patient 's disease potentially curative . A known immunodeficiency include HIV . Appropriate trial individual HIV may consider later date . History malignancy besides prostate cancer last 5 year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer treat local resection . ( The effect study treatment , potentially dormant malignant disease know ) . Use oral inhale parenteral corticosteroid immunomodulatory drug within 60 day start . [ Use steroid start consider principal investigator ( PI ) casebycase basis . ] Use estrogens ( include herbal phytoestrogens ) ketoconazole within 30 day start , study . Failure fully recover grade 1 good effect prior chemotherapy regardless interval since last treatment . Other concurrent chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational agent last 30 day ( one month washout start treatment ; patient could register start washout ) . Known hypersensitivity one component study medication . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
