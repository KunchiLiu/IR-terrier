	<brief_summary>This trial set determine whether combination azithromycin artesunate ( AZ+AS ) good current standard treatment uncomplicated malaria Tanzania , artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) . There two reason important 1. limited range drug combination work malaria area Tanzania 2. azithromycin antimalarial property , also broad-spectrum antibiotic , combination effective antimalarial might place diagnostic facility syndromic treatment fever . Artesunate azithromycin use alone combination drug child Tanzania many year , consider safe . There trial evidence effectiveness combination adult Asia , well in-vitro ( laboratory ) evidence work malaria parasite . The trial randomize child non-severe malaria new combination AZ+AS standard care arm AL . The primary outcome parasitological failure rate day 28- meaning malaria parasites get clear , stay clear least 28 day . Secondary outcome include safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azithromycin + Artesunate v Artemether-lumefantrine Uncomplicated Malaria .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial drug . Artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) select drug use treat uncomplicated malaria Tanzania . There extensive efficacy , effectiveness safety data combination Tanzania . Artesunate key component ACTs . It use monotherapy , highly effective antimalarial use combination another drug antimalarial property . There many year experience artesunate combination Africa appear safe child . Azithromycin license use childhood infection trachoma . It well tolerate appear safe child ; example effect occasional bone-marrow toxicity see chroramphenicol , skin reaction sometimes see sulpha-drugs . It active majority childhood bacterial infection . There extensive safety data azithromycin , include data azithromycin safety tolerability African child . Azithromycin show significant antimalarial activity vitro . There good vitro data artemisinin + azithromycin combination malaria include test interaction . As prophylactic drug malaria azithromycin effective West East Africa . Azithromycin-artesunate use antimalarial drug combination Asia . There experience small trial combination artemisinin drug azithromycin treat P. falciparum Southeast Asia less effective artesunate-mefloquine artemether-doxycycline several factor , especially low dos azithromycin use two study pattern antibiotic use locally may well contribute ; combination appear safe . This contrast evidence East Africa azithromycin effective antimalarial use prophylaxis , several reason may well effective East Africa SE Asia . Objectives . The overall study objective therefore compare efficacy azithromycin-artesunate artemether-lumefantrine treatment non-severe falciparum malaria child area high antimalarial drug resistance . Specific objectives ) compare effect drug parasitological failure rate 28 day arm , unadjusted adjust reinfection judge genotyping ii ) compare drug clinical failure rate 28 day . iii ) compare drug clinical parasitological failure day 42. iv ) compare drug combination adverse event side effect v ) undertake cost-effectiveness analysis two drug combination . Study design . A randomised controlled trial azithromycin-artesunate artemether-lumefantrine treatment non-severe falciparum malaria child 6 month 5 year old . The trial conduct among child attend MCH clinic one hospital Tanga region ( Muheza Designated District Hospital ) symptoms compatible malaria . Those malaria parasite blood smear consider inclusion . The trial 1 . A randomised , open-label trial carry . The slide reader assess primary endpoint blind treatment allocation , analysis perform intention-to-treat . 2 . All study drug regimen oral . After educate patient need complete course prescribed clinician , drug administer direct observed therapy ( DOT ) nurse study team morning dose even dose ( AL ) take home . Screening . Patients non-severe ( WHO definition ) slide proven malaria &gt; 2000 parasites/microL recruit Maternal Child Health ( MCH ) clinic Teule Hospital follow initial pilot study identify solve logistic problem . Project nurse interview parents/guardians febrile child recent ( past 48 hour ) history fever exclude cause fever . Those clearly seriously unwell ( unconscious , fitting etc ) triaged immediately emergency admission team . Those fever history fever refer rapid diagnostic testing ( RDT ) blood take fingerprick . A slide take time , use study team hospital team appropriate . If RDTs positive study slide make , stain read refer study physician ; RDTs negative Teule hospital doctor . Duplicate thick thin blood smear make probable malaria case , Giemsa stain pH 7.2 , examine microscopically . All patient see study team re-assessed physician study team exclude concomitant infection ( ) . Regimen allocation Random number generate computer allocate two study regimen block random size . Patients consent participate study register numerically present . The registration ( enrolment ) number patient determine drug regimen give . Registration number correspond seal opaque envelope treatment allocation . Opening envelope deem randomisation , intention treat analysis proceed basis Once randomise , child treat study drug allocate unless withdraw withdrawn study . Follow-up Patients would observe day 0,1,2,7,14,28 42 . Finger-prick malaria blood slide , haemacue filter paper blood specimen genotyping take day 0 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 28 42 day child present unwell , venous blood drawn full blood count liver enzymes day 0 14 . Rescue medication Quinine dose 10-mg/kg body weight 7 day rescue medication , per Tanzanian national guideline . 1 . If patient find deteriorate clinical condition presence asexual parasites day 0-3 treatment deem early treatment failure ; admit parenteral treatment . 2 . If patient develop severe complicate malaria ( WHO ) stage admitted parenteral treatment . 3 . Patients recrudesce without symptom study period treat oral quinine visit every day VHCs support guardian detect problem early . If sign deterioration unexpected side effect admit . At day 7 post commencing rescue treatment patient blood film ; positive admit directly observe therapy . 4 . Patients recrudesce quinine treatment treat inpatient accord local guideline . Recrudescence versus reinfection . Blood PCR collect patient enrolment follow-up outline . PCR analysis parasite gene perform patient re-appearance parasitaemia order differentiate re-infection recrudescence . Adverse event If patient unable tolerate trial medication reason discontinuation record Clinical Record Form `` adverse event '' alternative rescue medication initiate . Any significant clinical laboratory abnormality judge senior attend physician ( PI ) record adverse event . Assessment efficacy ; primary outcome : day 28 slide clearance The day first treatment day 0 . The day 28 slide clearance rate primary end point therapeutic efficacy trial . It proportion treat patient asexual parasitaemia double-read microscopist blind treatment allocation , receive rescue medication within period . Assessment efficacy ; secondary endpoint . All analysis intention-to treat unless otherwise specify . ) Day 14 slide clearance rate slide double-read blind treatment allocation ii ) Clinical failure rate day 28 iii ) Clinical failure rate day 14 iv ) Parasitological clinical failure day 42 v ) Day 28 recrudescence rate assess PCR vi ) Day 14 42 recrudescence rate assess PCR vii ) Day 28 hemoglobin level viii ) Differences side effects/AE group ix ) A per-protocol analysis day 14 day 28 outcome</detailed_description>
