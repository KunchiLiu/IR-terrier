	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , tolerability efficacy combretastatin A4 phosphate ( CA4P ) , also know fosbretabulin , combination bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , carboplatin paclitaxel patient chemotherapy naïve non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This randomized parallel arm study . All participant receive carboplatin , paclitaxel bevacizumab , half additionally receive CA4P . Patients complete first 6 cycle therapy experience disease progression receive maintenance therapy bevacizumab alone bevacizumab plus CA4P . The rationale study potential additive synergistic action vascular disrupt agent like CA4P anti-angiogenic agent like bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Carboplatin , Paclitaxel , Bevacizumab CA4P Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer become leading cause cancer death men woman US Europe , account 29 % cancer death . Non-Small Cell Lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account approximately 80 % lung cancer case . Currently , curative treatment available advanced stage disease ( stag III IV ) , comprise majority case . Treatment combination carboplatin paclitaxel show effective well tolerate advanced stage NSCLC . Targeted therapy , bevacizumab , often act synergistically chemotherapy . Bevacizumab inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , necessary endothelial cell proliferation new blood vessel formation . CA4P target exist abnormal vasculature tumor , impede tumor blood flow lead extensive tumor cell death consequence oxygen nutrient deprivation . This study compare effect CA4P combine chemotherapy bevacizumab progression free survival ( PFS ) PFS chemotherapy bevacizumab alone .</detailed_description>
