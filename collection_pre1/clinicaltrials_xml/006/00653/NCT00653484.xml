	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Calories physical exercise may affect risk develop cancer . It yet know whether low-calorie diet and/or physical activity program effective prevent cancer participant increase risk develop colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study diet physical activity healthy overweight , obese , inactive participant risk develop colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare four 12-week energy-balance intervention comprise physical activity intervention ( +2,000 kcal/wk ) , dietary energy restriction intervention ( DER ) ( -2,000 kcal/wk ) , combined physical activity DER intervention ( +1,000/-1,000 kcal/wk ) v intervention healthy , overweight , moderately obese participant increase risk develop colorectal cancer . - To quantify change circulate biomarkers ( e.g. , insulin , IGF-1 , leptin , c-reactive protein , isoprostanes ) propose mediate anticarcinogenic effect DER participant . OUTLINE : This study consist 2-week run-in period ( baseline ) follow 12-week intervention period . Participants undergo three study visit Vanderbilt University General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Beginning study visit 1 , participant undergo 2-week run-in period obtain baseline measure body composition ( via dual x-ray absorptiometry ) , cardiorespiratory fitness ( via treadmill test ) , physical activity , dietary intake , energy expenditure , metabolic activity . Dietary assessment use 24-hour dietary recall conduct GCRC dietitian run-in period . GCRC dietitians complete three 24-hour recall randomly select day 2-week assessment period provide estimate participant 's habitual food intake baseline . Baseline energy need assessed activity monitor run-in period obtain measure participant 's rest energy expenditure total daily energy expenditure . Participants also assess use brief psychological profile use individualize study intervention participant . Approximately 10-14 day initial visit baseline assessment complete , participant undergo second study visit . Participants randomize 1 4 intervention arm . - Arm I ( physical activity ) : Participants undergo in-person , 30- 60-minute counseling visit , follow five brief 10- 15-minute telephone-counseling call 12 week . During initial counseling session , participant learn goal set develop personalized plan meet intervention goal . Participants instruct wear proper shoe monitor exercise duration intensity . Participants also give pedometer help track activity pattern monitor progress meeting program objective . Participants must wear pedometer 7 day baseline 12 week . The information provide used estimate overall physical activity energy expenditure ( PAEE ) , step per day , time spend different level activity . Participants monitor periodically adherence exercise program behavioral counsel self-reported log daily exercise pedometer step . Dietary intake measure periodically use multiple 24-hour dietary recall carefully ass possible change energy intake dietary quality course study . - Arm II ( dietary energy restriction [ DER ] ) : Based initial estimate energy need determine run-in period , participant receive reduced-calorie , food exchange-based diet 12 week . Each diet individualized achieve desire daily energy deficit 300 calorie per day base physical activity level . All meal prepare GCRC metabolic kitchen . Participants receive one multivitamin per day nutritional supplement . Fluids include coffee , water , drink allow pre-study level . Each week , participant meet dietitian discus participant 's progress , submit daily report food intake , return uneaten food item , provide urine sample assessment urinary biomarkers . Adherence diet monitor compliance food pick-up , dietary record , measure urinary metabolite . Participants also provide individual instruction , counseling , assessment study dietitian . - Arm III ( physical activity DER ) : Participants undergo 12-week DER physical-activity program , describe arm I II , exception dose PAEE DER combine intervention ( i.e. , +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week ) half individual intervention ( +2,000 kcal/week arm I -2,000 kcal/week arm II ) . Participants arm III receive individualize reduced-calorie diet design achieve desire daily energy deficit 150 calorie per day base participant physical activity level . - Arm IV ( wait-list control ) : Participants follow periodically . At study visit 3 , completion 12-week study intervention , participant undergo repeat assessment body composition , fitness , diet , activity measure . Participants undergo blood urine sample collection baseline 12 week correlative laboratory study . Blood sample assess circulate biomarkers involve energy homeostasis metabolic control ( e.g. , insulin , IGF , leptin ) inflammation oxidative stress ( e.g. , c-reactive protein , PGE-2 , isoprostanes ) . Urine sample examine biomarkers dietary protein intake ( i.e. , nitrogen content ) , dietary sodium , potassium intake . Participants complete Community Health Activities Model Program Seniors Physical Activity Questionnaire baseline 12 week assessment PAEE non-occupational activity , include social activity , recreation , hobby , housework , walking , jogging , 14 type exercise .</detailed_description>
