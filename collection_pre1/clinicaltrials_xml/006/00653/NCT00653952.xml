	<brief_title>CAELYX Versus Paclitaxel HCl Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Following Failure First-Line , Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , comparative study CAELYX versus Paclitaxel HCl treatment patient epithelial ovarian carcinoma follow failure first line chemotherapy platinum-based regimen . Patients enter trial stratify prospectively platinum-sensitivity bulky disease analyze retrospectively prior anthracycline therapy . Protocol-eligible patient , measurable disease , receive one prior regimen , platinum-based , randomized receive either one-hour intravenous infusion CAELYX , 50 mg/m2 every 28 day , Paclitaxel HCl , 175 mg/m2 3 hour infusion every 21 day . Patients treat one year . It suggest respond patient receive least 6 cycle treatment . Patients ongoing clinical benefit may continue study drug upon approval sponsor long patient 's interest absence severe toxicity . It suggest patient exhibit complete response ( CR ) receive 2 subsequent cycle treatment . Patients exhibit partial response ( PR ) may continue receive study drug long therapeutic benefit derive suggest receive least 3 subsequent cycle study drug . Patients undergo appropriate radiological imaging ( x-ray , CT scan , MRI ) document baseline disease , well chest x-ray assessment leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) MUGA scan within 30 day prior first dose study drug . Patients follow weekly hematological toxicity . Radiological imaging repeat every 7-8 week assess disease status . Patients achieve complete partial response reevaluate 4 week later confirm initial observation response . All patient follow minimum one year disease progression survival . LVEF assess MUGA scan baseline , cumulative anthracycline dose reach 300 mg/m2 ( 500 mg/m2 epirubicin ) , every 2 cycle CAELYX thereafter . Endomyocardial biopsy recommend patient receive &gt; 400 mg/m2 CAELYX alone cumulative anthracycline dose &gt; 550 mg/m2 ( include CAELYX ; 900 mg/m2 epirubicin ) . [ NOTE : This study initiate 7-May-1997 . Due poor accrual , study enrollment terminate 31-Aug-1999 . Patients follow study completion 12-Apr-2000 . During preparation study report ( begin May 2003 ) , sit re-queried clarification safety survival data . ] DOXIL , dose 50 mg/m2 i.v . infusion 1 hour every 28 day 1 year . Paclitaxel , dose 175 mg/m2 i.v . infusion 3 hour start Day 1 21-day cycle 1 year .</detailed_description>
