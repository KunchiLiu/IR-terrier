	<brief_title>Laryngeal Mask Supreme™ Versus I-gel™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LMA Supreme™ I-gel™ new develop supraglottic airway device provide patent airway general anesthesia . So far , prospective randomize controlled trial compare performance yet publish . Both device use difficult airway situation , pre-hospital hospital . In prospective , randomize , control cross-over trial , go evaluate performance device simulate difficult airway scenario use extrication collar limit mouth open neck movement . In maximum total 60 patient undergoing elective surgery , place airway device consecutively ventilate patient . First attempt success rate time success record . Secondary outcome include oropharyngeal pressure leak , ease gastric catheter insertion , adverse event side effect . Our hypothesis difference exist two device . Our 0-hypothesis difference</detailed_description>
