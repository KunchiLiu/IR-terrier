Study design : Study conduct randomize control trial tertiary care neonatal unit . Healthy neonates born 35 complete week gestation eligible enrolment clinically evident jaundice first week life . In enrolled neonate , level jaundice assess two method - CaB follow TcB ( BiliCheck® , SpectRx Inc , Norcross , GA ) . By random allocation method , one estimate use decide need blood sample confirm STB .

	<detailed_description>Introduction/objectives : As bilirubin concentration serum increase , deposit skin subcutaneous tissue , produce physical sign jaundice.1 There well-established relationship serum total bilirubin ( STB ) concentration intensity jaundice neonates.2 But variation color perception human eye , difference neonatal skin pigmentation , variation intensity color available light affect ability individual estimate STB clinical assessment alone.3-10 Transcutaneous bilirubin ( TcB ) measure spectrophotometry positive linear correlation STB , therefore , useful screen tool measure clinically significant jaundice.11-14 Newer device BiliCheck® even correct effect skin pigmentation TcB measurement therefore report closer agreement STB.15-17 American Academy Pediatrics guideline management hyperbilirubinemia term near-term neonate , caution rely clinical assessment severity jaundice.18 Therefore , blood sample STB measurement need significant proportion healthy clinically jaundiced neonate . As compare clinical assessment TcB think accurate objective estimate STB , use may decrease need blood sample measure STB . Observational retrospective analysis estimate routine use Tc bilirubinometry jaundice assessment result 34 % 80 % reduction need blood sample STB measurement.19-21 Objective randomize clinical trial determine routine use transcutaneous bilirubinometry decrease need blood sample confirmation STB healthy term near term neonate ? In addition , also assess correlation agreement TcB CaB measure STB . Methodology : Study conduct randomize control trial tertiary care hospital . Neonates born 35 complete week gestation eligible enrolment develop clinical jaundice 25 168 h life . Neonates Rh hemolytic disease , require NICU admission 24 h , major congenital malformation receive phototherapy exclude . Study carry November 1 , 2006 July 7 , 2007 except month March 2007 primary investigator post clinical service area . A log book maintain delivery area hospital identify neonate born 35 week gestation . Gestation assign base 1st trimester ultrasound . In event non-availability ultrasound report , gestation assign date last menstrual period confirm Expanded New Ballard Score22 within 24 h age . After receive write informed consent parent , identify neonate assess every 8-12 h clinical jaundice . On identification clinical jaundice , primary investigator assign clinically assess level bilirubin ( CaB ) . This assessment perform adequately illuminated room . Skin blanch digital pressure , reveal underlie color skin subcutaneous tissue five dermal zone ( described Kramer ) . Both extent intensity yellowish discoloration use assign CaB . Each clinical assessment immediately follow transcutaneous measurement bilirubin ( TcB ) . TcB average five sequential measurement forehead obtain use BiliCheck® ( SpectRx Inc , Norcross , GA ) . Clinical assessment always precede transcutaneous measurement prevent primary investigator get bias TcB value . We conduct pilot study unit find 15 % neonate ( ≥35 wk gestation ) undergo blood sample measurement STB first week life ( unpublished data ) . Sample size relative reduction 40 % need blood sampling ( absolute reduction ( 15 % 9 % ) , power 80 % two-sided significance 5 % 492 assessment group . By random allocation method , either CaB TcB use decide need blood sample measure STB . Need blood sample defined present bilirubin assess allocate method exceed 80 % age-specific cut-off phototherapy per American Academy Pediatrics 2004 guidelines.7 STB measure use twin-beam spectrophometry ( Gineveri , Italy ) . Neonates discharge complete 72 h age bring hospital assessment jaundice 24-72 h discharge per AAP recommendation . Up three assessment conduct least 12 h apart neonate could include study . Such repetitive assessment independently randomize irrespective previous assignment . Randomized sequence generate fixed block size six use web-based random number generator.The random code keep serially number , opaque seal identical envelops . The envelope open obtain CaB TcB value . Chief investigator unaware process randomization . We aware possibility erroneously miss significant jaundice baby qualify sample randomized method assessment . To safeguard occurrence , clinical team authority take over-riding decision measure STB . Incidence 'overriding decision ' outcome term need phototherapy record . We analyze relationship two method assessment bilirubin : transcutaneous bilirubinometry ( TcB ) clinical assessment bilirubin ( CaB ) serum total bilirubin ( STB ) . This relationship describe correlation agreement two STB . All base line outcome data record prospectively pre-tested proforma . The data enter Epi infoTM version 3.3.2 . The data check completion , consistency accuracy . For quality control ten percent record check independent investigator random basis . Data analyze use Epi infoTM version 3.3.2. Stata software version 9.1 . Group characteristic compare χ2 test two-sample t-test discrete continuous variable respectively . P value &lt; 0.05 take statistically significant . Analysis intention-to-treat . Correlation STB value TcB CaB determine Pearson correlation analysis . We determine limit agreement could apply whole population statistical analysis describe Bland Altman . The protocol clear institutional Ethics Committee . Informed consent take one parent enrol infant . Keywords : jaundice , neonate , transcutaneous bilirubinometry , clinical assessment bilirubin</detailed_description>
