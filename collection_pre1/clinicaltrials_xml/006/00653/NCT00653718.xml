	<brief_summary>In 2005 , EBCIG demonstrate efficacy tamoxifen improve overall survival hormone receptor positive breast cancer . However , tamoxifen show partial estrogen agonist activity , responsible drug 's detrimental effect endometrial carcinoma , thromboembolism , tamoxifen resistance . More recently , aromatase inhibitor show superior tamoxifen metastatic adjuvant setting . The ATAC trial demonstrate improved disease-free survival ( DFS ) 5 year anastrozole compare 5 year tamoxifen 3 . The BIG 1-98 trial result demonstrate median follow-up 25.8 month , letrozole improve DFS distant DFS compare tamoxifen . Based result , adjuvant hormonal therapy Aromatase Inhibitors ( AI ) become preferred therapy post-menopausal woman . However , AI therapy also associate toxicity merit in-depth study , one increase musculoskeletal pain . In ATAC trial , median follow-up 5.7 year , arthralgia significantly high ( 35.6 % vs. 29.4 % ) fracture also increase ( 11.0 % vs. 7.7 % ) anastrozole administer 5 year follow surgery without chemotherapy 3 . The incidence arthralgia also significantly high MA-17 trial , 25 % patient receive letrozole develop arthralgia compare 21 % placebo group follow 5 6 year tamoxifen 5 . Traditionally cancer clinical trial , report musculoskeletal pain base `` Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events '' , cover wide range symptom facilitate documentation pain syndrome specific manner . Therefore , need design study describe nature pain associate administration AI therapy use tool validate capture multidimensional phenomenon pain .</brief_summary>
