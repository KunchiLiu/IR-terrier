	<detailed_description>PROBE test three biomarkers PD subject control determine feasibility potential utility marker risk prognosis PD . This case control study , PD subject compare neurologically healthy control disease control ( MSA PSP ) . The blood biomarker sample draw evaluate blood alpha-synuclein level well collection lymphocyte mass array analysis . Olfaction measure use UPSIT subject . The UPSIT conduct part PostCEPT PD subject repeat study PD subject do within 6 month . Control subject may also choose submit blood specimen process storage Coriell Institute Medical Research , research resource support NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center . Follow-up PD population 3-year period allow u evaluate prognosis important motor aspect PD occur frequently cohort . These complication PD include motor complication , postural instability , non-motor impairment cognitive decline . Healthy disease control subject may give permission Baseline visit contact follow previously establish PSG FOUND study use mail telephone contact assess clinical status . Participation FOUND study provide another mechanism maintain contact subject collect supplemental data beyond collected PROBE Baseline visit .</detailed_description>
