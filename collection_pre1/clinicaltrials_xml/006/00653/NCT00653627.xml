	<brief_title>A Study Quantify Bacille Calmette Guerin ( BCG ) Characterise Immune Response After BCG Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last 3 year , McShane group Oxford establish clinical trial programme evaluate safety immunogenicity BCG prime-MVA85A boost vaccination strategy series Phase I study UK . To date , Oxford , safety immunogenicity MVA85A ( dose 5x10^7 pfu ) assess 14 mycobacterially BCG naïve individual , 27 individual previously vaccinate BCG 12 individual latently infect M.tb . In 53 individual serious severe adverse event , single vaccination MVA85A highly immunogenic BCG naïve volunteer , significantly moreso BCG prim volunteer . ( 23 ) Following success UK study , 21 healthy individual ( 11 BCG naïve , 10 BCG prim ) Gambia 24 healthy adult Cape Town , South Africa ( ongoing age de-escalation phase II trial ) , vaccinate MVA85A , serious severe adverse event , safety immunogenicity profile comparable UK . A study infant Gambia underway adolescent arm age de-escalation study Cape Town also underway . Interferon-gamma protective correlate need identify immunological correlate protection : In study date , ( preclinical clinical ) , main immunological readout ex-vivo interferon-gamma ( IFN- ) Elispot assay , use ass specific T cell response tuberculin PPD , purify antigen 85 complex pool overlap 15mer peptide span length antigen 85A . The secretion IFN-y antigen-specific T cell best available immunological correlate protective immunity . The rationale evidence support use assay determine IFN- production correlate protection substantial , alone , may sufficient . There increase evidence CD4 ( + ) T cell possess IFN-gamma-independent mechanism limit growth intracellular pathogen dominant secondary response M. tuberculosis . It clear new immunological correlate protection need identify , give considerable time cost involve Phase III efficacy trial new TB vaccine , therefore urgent need identify protective correlate help distinguish candidate demonstrate safe immunogenic phase I trials . Whilst infect human volunteer TB address issue , use another replicating mycobacteria , BCG , surrogate . A good vaccine TB also reduce BCG replication increase BCG clearance . The objective proposal perform preliminary work necessary develop BCG 'challenge ' model bacterial ( BCG ) load skin assess follow vaccination MVA85A . Such challenge model base evidence animal give subunit vaccination TB attenuate T cell response replicate mycobacteria administer challenge agent . The hypothesis model replication BCG hence induction BCG induce immune response abrogate pre-existing immunity induce subunit vaccine , MVA85A . In addition , replication intradermal BCG administer challenge agent assess biopsy volunteer ' skin . So , method would allow correlation immune response elicit MVA85A vaccination direct indirect measure diminish intradermal mycobacterial ( BCG ) replication human . There three part model : 1 . Preliminary mouse pilot study This involve current ongoing work identify time mycobacterial load BCG vaccination site ( ear ) may high ( therefore detectable bacterial quantification method ) , murine model : Mice vaccinate intradermal BCG , ear , sacrifice different timepoints , ear lymphoid tissue harvest BCG quantitation . Real -time PCR ( RTPCR ) , histological analysis use stain Ziehl-Nielson mycobacterial culture technique perform tissue quantify BCG present . Numbers BCG present timepoints compare . Preliminary work suggest BCG replication vaccination site decrease time , investigate . The result advise timing biopsy blister human pilot study , chance recover significant number BCG maximise . 2 . Human pilot study base result 1 ) This proposal refer part model . 24 BCG naïve human volunteer vaccinate BCG ( SSI strain ) intradermally deltoid muscle arm . The total dose give standard dose use BCG vaccination program worldwide : 0.1ml 2-8x10^6 pfu/ml , i.e. , 2-8x10^5 pfu . In study half dose ( 1-4x10^5 pfu ) administer arm . All volunteer punch biopsy one vaccination site suction blister form , ( volunteer comparison ) , 3 different timepoints post-vaccination . Preliminary BCG quantitation method biopsy tissue first 6 volunteer ( biopsy 2 week post-vaccination ) show 5x10^2 4x10^3 BCG cfu present vaccination site , 2 week post-vaccination . We yet know replication BCG skin peak , , timepoint . Results preliminary murine experiment suggest BCG replication skin decrease time , would seem necessitate another early timepoint human trial , `` catch '' replication . However , also know ( murine experiment ) maximal BCG replication local drain lymphoid tissue occur 3-4 week post-vaccination , quantitating BCG skin 4 week may miss peak BCG replication . In addition know BCG replication intradermally mouse ear necessarily resemble human skin . For reason , order fully characterise kinetics BCG human skin post-vaccination , shall vaccinate 3 group volunteer outline section 4 , `` Trial Design '' , incorporate early late timepoints biopsy blister ( 1 , 2 4 week ) . The suction blister create use standard technique use number dermatology research group ; negative pressure 25-40 kPa ( 200-300mmHg ) atmospheric pressure apply via suction chamber , 2 4 hour use clinical suction pump ( VP25 portable suction unit , Eschmann , Sussex , UK ) unilocular blister measure 10-15mm diameter form . This procedure painless . Mycobacterial quantification technique apply biopsy fluid specimen ( RT-PCR culture ) , timepoint yield high number BCG choose randomise human trial . In addition , flow cytometry assay apply blister fluid specimen characterise local cellular reaction BCG . 3 . Future Prospective randomise human trial ( base result 1 &amp; 2 ) : 2 group BCG naïve subject randomise receive either single immunization MVA85A saline . The number per group decide basis result murine work BCG pilot study , account level variability BCG replication , number per group able reliably detect significant difference BCG replication 2 group ( exist ) . The vaccine-induced immune response fully characterise . At 4 week , volunteer `` challenge '' ( intradermally ) BCG . BCG-induced immune response monitor 6 month . In addition , punch biopsy ( +/- suction blister ) take BCG vaccination site amount bacteria present quantified . The correlation reduction BCG replication MVA85A-induced immune response assess , order identify potential correlate protection . Future candidate vaccine assess capacity induce immune response . Potential risk human subject : The general risk participant human pilot study associate phlebotomy , vaccination , punch biopsy suction blister technique . Mild tenderness , bruising , fainting may result venepuncture . The volume blood drawn study period ( 504.5ml +/- 20ml ) compromise otherwise healthy subject . BCG license vaccine use last 100 year , give 4 billion people , excellent safety profile . Potential vaccination risk include follow : ( Local reaction : An inflammatory reaction manifest redness swelling , form small ulcer , may occur site vaccine injection . This usually heal leaf small flat scar . It also possible develop swell gland armpit , less one centimetre across . These natural reaction vaccine . Uncommonly ( less 1 100 people ) swell gland armpit 1cm across ulcer discharge fluid injection site may occur . Rare side effect ( less 1 1000 people ) include inflammation gland , sometimes abscesses discharge fluid swelling . Systemic Reactions : Systemic reaction immunization BCG could potentially occur rare ( less 1 1000 people ) include low-grade fever headache , allergic reaction . Disseminated complication BCG osteitis osteomyelitis also report extremely rare usually report immunocompromised , immunocompetent individual . Punch biopsy suction blister risk : There small risk punch biopsy site blister site may become infected . If occur , treatment antibiotic may require . The punch biopsy site heal form small scar . A small scar might develop blister site often barely visible several month . Allergic Reactions Anaphylaxis : As vaccine , allergic reaction possible . Very rarely allergic reaction local anaesthetic ( administer prior punch biopsy ) may occur . Known Potential Benefits : Volunteers benefit partial protection TB , vaccination BCG . Volunteers gain information general health status pre-study screen assessment . It also hop information gain study contribute development safe effective TB vaccine HIV negative positive individual .</detailed_description>
