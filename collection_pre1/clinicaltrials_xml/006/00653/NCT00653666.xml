	<detailed_description>With advent enhance screening ( via tandem mass spectroscopy , MS/MS ) , Northwest Regional Newborn Screening Program ( NWRNSP ) identify high incidence carnitine palmitoyl transferase type 1A ( CPT1A ) deficiency Alaska Native infant . Since October 2003 approximately 80 Alaska Native infant identified condition ; previously 30 published case know worldwide . All infant homozygous c.1436C-T sequence variant CPT1A gene , result substitution leucine proline amino acid position 479 ( P479L ) , approximately 80 % reduction CPT1A activity ( non-classic CPT1A deficiency ) ( 7 ) . The clinical implication restrict level enzyme activity know . However , patient severe reduction CPT1A activity ( result mutation ) know high risk hypoketotic hypoglycemia , liver dysfunction , sudden unexplained death ( 1 ) . Hepatomegaly micro- macro-vesicular steatosis also common ( 16 ) . Currently treatment Alaska Native infant child CPT1A deficiency base data patient severe form CPT1A deficiency fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) disorder . Our ultimate goal establish evidence-based guideline treatment form CPT1A deficiency prevalent Alaska Native population . This pilot study address two specific question provide first glimpse physiologic effect homozygosity c.1436C-T sequence variant CPT1A gene . These data aid development strategy clinical management evaluate future prospective study , provide preliminary data require application NIH fund in-depth characterization clinical consequence condition .</detailed_description>
