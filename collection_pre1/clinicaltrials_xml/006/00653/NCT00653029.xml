	<brief_summary>Approximately 1.1 million people year suffer mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) , concussion , United States . Although MTBI patient fully recover , many 28 % physical , cognitive , and/or emotional symptom 6 month post-injury . When symptom persist past three month , know post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) . The cause PCS unknown , structural neuroimaging neuropsychological ( NP ) test result often normal . However , recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) research concuss adult show difference brain activity compare control work memory task , despite normal structural MRI neuropsychological finding . We propose improve research assess brain activation pattern simple versus complex attention work memory task 10 concuss adult via fMRI . This first study examine brain activation pattern associate degree effort apply test , factor know confound interpretation NP test performance . Validated computerized measure selective attention ( Modified Stroop Interference Task ) , work memory ( n-back ) , effort ( Green 's Medical Symptom Validity Test ; MSVT ) use . Ten pay control use comparative purpose . We hypothesize concussed patient show less brain activation control complex versus simple work memory task activation pattern concuss patient generally low suboptimal effort . We also characterize self-reported emotional physical symptom PCS patient , do prior fMRI research population .</brief_summary>
