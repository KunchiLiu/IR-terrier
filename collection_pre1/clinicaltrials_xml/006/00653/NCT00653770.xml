	<brief_summary>This Phase I study whose primary outcome ass safety new tuberculosis vaccine , FP85A , administer individually sequentially MVA85A prime-boost regime , healthy volunteer , previously vaccinate BCG . The secondary outcome ass cellular immune response population . The trial consist 36 subject 3 group . The first group vaccinate FP85A alone , second group vaccinate MVA85A follow FP85A 28 day later third group vaccinate FP85A follow MVA85A 28 day later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recombinant fowlpox virus vector Fowlpox virus infectious avian specie , able express antigen mammalian cell induce protective immune response , make suitable candidate vector . Recombinant fowlpox virus develop express antigen tumour cell , HIV malaria . FP9 live , highly attenuated form European strain fowlpox virus . It derive multiple passage avian cell , follow plaque purification genome fully characterise . Fowlpox virus initially use recombinant avian vaccine , also show potent inducer CD8+T cell preclinical mammalian model human trial . In fact , FP9 find immunogenic wild type fowlpox , use recombinant MVA prime boost regime induce protective immune response Plasmodium berghi . Clinical experience recombinant fowlpox virus Oxford Three FP vaccine encode different malaria antigen use far clinical trial Oxford , FP9 ME-TRAP , FP9 CS FP9 PP . To date 87 dos FP9 ME-TRAP give 55 volunteer Oxford use various regimen combination DNA well recombinant MVA vaccine . The local systemic safety profile FP9 ME-TRAP comparable describe recombinant MVA vaccine . No vaccine-related serious adverse event observe . Pain erythema injection site predominant local side effect , erythema maximal within 2 3 day post-vaccination receding . The common systemic side effect FP9 ME-TRAP feel feverish although always associate document fever . Other solicited side effect myalgia , arthralgia , headache nausea . FP9 CS use recently phase I study 25 healthy volunteer Oxford , dose 1x10^8 pfu . Analysis safety tolerability suggest similar side effect profile FP9 ME-TRAP . No serious adverse event note study . In phase I/IIa study near completion , 15 volunteer immunise 5x10^7 pfu FP9 PP , vaccine-related serious adverse event comparable adverse event .</detailed_description>
