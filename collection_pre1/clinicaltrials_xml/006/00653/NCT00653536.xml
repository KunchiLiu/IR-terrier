	<brief_summary>Patients acute ischemic stroke persistent arterial occlusion follow fail mechanical revascularization , undergo NeuroFlo treatment within 18 hour last time symptom free , eligible enrollment ass safety feasibility NeuroFlo catheter treat ischemic stroke patient persistent arterial occlusion follow attempted thrombectomy . The NeuroFlo catheter design partially obstruct abdominal descending aorta thereby increase blood flow brain . Cerebral perfusion improve divert blood vessel well expansion collateral circulation . Improved regional perfusion lead clinical improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Neuroflo Device People Who Have Had Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients occlusion proximal artery experience prompt diversion flow collateral retrograde perfusion occlude arterial tree . Collateral perfusion sustains penumbra may lessen stroke severity provide recanalization occlude artery occurs . Thrombectomy attempt achieve recanalization occlude artery , 36 % patient ( 90/252 MERCI MultiMERCI study ) experience persistent arterial occlusion ( PAO , define TICI flow 0-1 ) . PAO follow attempted thrombectomy associate high mortality , 53 % dead 90 day . Of survivor , 5 % achieve mRS 0-2 . At present , therapy show improve risk . Data obtain clinically indicate CT 24 hour use monitor safety . The safety endpoint study proportion patient experience : - Mortality neurological deterioration ( defined increase ≥4 point NIHSS ) 5 day post treatment - Change neurological status adverse event baseline 30 day treatment Other endpoint include : - Change neurological status adverse event baseline 90 day treatment - The incidence hemorrhagic transformation intracerebral bleeding assess 5 day post treatment . - Cerebral blood flow change associate device therapy assess multimodal CT MRI study acquire baseline 3 hour post treatment . - Potential patient benefit assess collection neurological index ( NIHSS etc . ) baseline , 24 hour post-procedure , day 5 ( discharge ) , 30 day 90 day .</detailed_description>
