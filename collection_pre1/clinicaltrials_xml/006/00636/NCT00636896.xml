	<brief_summary>This study design 3 week , randomize , double blind , placebo control , trial . Olanzapine modafinil titrate 10mg 200mg respectively . Feeding lab assessment conduct baseline endpoint . Assessments hunger/satiety , kilocalorie consume weight obtain . Plasma ghrelin PYY3-36 level draw baseline endpoint prior breakfast two hour post . Study hypothesis : The modafinil/olanzapine group gain less weight olanzapine/placebo group three week drug intake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atypical antipsychotic become drug choice treatment schizophrenia well acute maintenance therapy bipolar disorder . In addition , affective disorder find benefit agent ( Masan 2004 ) . These disorder represent chronic condition require extend treatment year lifetimes . In light ever widen use atypicals , attention must focus adverse reaction may limit compliance agent . Weight gain sedation proven associate many atypicals ( Allison et al . 1999 ; Wirshing et al . 1999 ) include clozapine , olanzapine , risperidone quetiapine . These side effect reduce compliance detrimental effect patient 's health long term treatment . In previous study , olanzapine risperidone demonstrate affect eating behavior weight/BMI compare placebo 2 week paradigm normal healthy human subject . Behaviors affect included appetite , report calorie consume per day , observed calorie consume feed laboratory . No effect see rest energy expenditure correct lean body weight . Also , sedation report 81.3 75 % olanzapine risperidone group respectively . Sedation primary reason , group , medication dose reduction . Weight gain sedation postulate associate blockade central nervous system ( CNS ) histamine-1 receptor ( H1 ) atypical agent ( Heisler 1998 ; Wirshing et al . 1999 ) . In light postulated mechanism , reasonable assume overcome H1 blockade histamine agonist may aid reduce side effect tolerable level . Thus , follow study propose . This study design randomize double blind , parallel group trial evaluate effect modafinil ( propose H1 agonist ) vs. placebo eat parameter , weight/BMI sedation healthy human subject receive olanzapine three week study period . This project utilize current state art feed lab procedure , review Mitchell colleague ( Mitchell et al . 1998 ) , good characterize effect modafinil olanzapine associate eating behavior . This project help determine efficacy utilize H1 agonist adjunctive medication patient receive atypical antipsychotic therapy prevent weight gain excess sedation .</detailed_description>
