	<brief_title>EL625 Persistent Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) think different manifestation disease . Treatment option CLL/SLL range watch wait approach bone marrow transplant . Currently consensus best treatment regimen new approach treatment need . EL625 20-mer antisense molecule bind cod region exon 10 p53 RNA transcript . It bind mutant wild type p53 . p53 involve regulate apoptosis DNA repair cell . When genetic damage occur p53 upregulated . As expression p53 increase normal cell likely undergo apoptosis rather cell cycle arrest DNA repair . However malignant cell , give level DNA damage likely undergo cell cycle arrest repair rather apoptosis . Because EL625 theorize increase response chemotherapy , propose add EL625 combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide rituximab .</detailed_description>
