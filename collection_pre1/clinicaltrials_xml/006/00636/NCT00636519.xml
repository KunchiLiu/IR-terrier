	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study : 1 . To evaluate model determine ability botulism antitoxin ( bivalent , Aventis ) neutralize Botulinum toxin Extensor Digitorum Brevis model muscle paralysis Stage A . 2 . To assess ability botulism antitoxin ( heptavalent , Cangene ) neutralize Botulinum toxin Extensor Digitorum Brevis model muscle paralysis Stage B .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Botulism rare disease ; however Botulinum toxin ( neurotoxin ) may use biological weapon especially form aerosol . Botulism cause neurotoxin produce obligate anaerobic , gram-positive , spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum ( 1 ) . C. botulinum produce 8 serologically distinct neurotoxin identify serotypes A , B , C1 , C2 , D , E , F , G ( 2 ) . Therapy botulism include supportive care passive immunization antitoxin . Antitoxin administer patient neurologic sign botulism soon possible clinical diagnosis ( 3 ) . Botulism antitoxin prepare plasma obtain horse immunize specific subtype botulism toxoid toxin . The BT-002 exploratory pharmacodynamic study perform evaluate effect Botulism Antitoxins prevent paralysis extensor digitorum brevis muscle follow BOTOX®/ MYOBLOC® administration . This study compare bivalent heptavalent product placebo . Safety data collect . NP-018 ( heptavalent equine-derived botulinum antitoxin ) prepare plasma obtain horse immunize specific subtype botulinum toxoid toxin . Each individual horse immunize single botulinum toxin subtype . Plasma pool horse immunize botulinum toxin subtype . For antitoxin serotype ( A-G ) , despeciated product produce pepsin digestion IgG monomer equine plasma , yield predominantly F ( ab ' ) 2 fragment . Following formulation , seven antitoxin serotypes blend heptavalent product fill single-use vial . ' This research study conduct two stage - Stage A Stage B . If enrol Stage A study , subject equal chance get either bivalent botulism antitoxin placebo . If enrol Stage B study , subject equal chance get heptavalent botulism antitoxin ( NP-018 ) placebo . The subject receive injection Botox Myobloc next day antitoxin administration leave right foot respectively . The subject 's participation study maximum 57 day .</detailed_description>
