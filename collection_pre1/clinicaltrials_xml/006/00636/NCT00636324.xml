	<brief_summary>Despite widely use nasal CPAP preterm infant , uncertainty regard aspect application remain . Clinical indication vary greatly institution , especially combined variety system , device , technique available . One controversial aspect need clarify level pressure use . The objective study compare effectiveness two range nCPAP pressure within spectrum current practice post-extubation support preterm infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Level Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Preterm Infants After Extubation ( L-CPAP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use nCPAP establish effective respiratory support prevent extubation failure treatment pulmonary disease . An upsurge popularity result controversial aspect , include level pressure use . The level use preterm infant extubation , mostly come anecdotal data , vary 3 10 cmH2O . Physiologic study show high nCPAP pressure improve lung mechanical property . Though potential side effect concern practical application , formal evidence support concept increase CPAP pressure result high risk complication . In relatively stable preterm infant , range optimal CPAP level need establish order adequately support upper airway lung , without increase complication secondary pressure apply . Given uncertainty nCPAP pressure use preterm infant , conduct randomize controlled trial compare effectiveness two range nCPAP pressure post-extubation support preterm infant . The purpose trial compare rate successful extubation use nasal CPAP level 7 9 cmH2O compare level 4 6 cmH2O .</detailed_description>
