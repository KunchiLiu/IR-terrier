	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent ( parent ) assent ( child ) , screen procedure include administration abbreviate intellectual test battery , work memory battery , computerize attention measure survivor ( see specific Measures ) . Our goal enroll 24 ( 12 ALL , 12 brain tumor ) participant intervention phase prospective pilot study . To reach goal , anticipate need screen approximately 50 survivor , though enrollment end , continue , 24 eligible participant identify randomize intervention phase . Parents complete questionnaire measure regard child 's adaptive , behavioral , emotional , attentional functioning . Follow-up interviewing conduct clarify potential problem identify questionnaire . The entire screening procedure estimate take approximately 90 minute survivor 30-45 minute parent . To maximize efficiency , two study personnel work family - one complete test child , complete questionnaire follow-up interviewing parent . The design double-blind , placebo-controlled trial half participant randomize intervention condition half receive comparison computer program . Specifically , participant assign comparison ( placebo ) condition complete modify version CT home . The treatment comparison CT program begin identically , low difficulty level . Those treatment condition complete activity increase difficulty intervention period . Those placebo condition , contrast , complete basic task session intervention , regardless performance . In way , true estimate obtain efficacy treatment program .</detailed_description>
