	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin , Gemcitabine , Erlotinib Study Patients With Advanced Chemo-na√Øve Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan GEMOX-Erlotinib consist erlotinib 100 mg orally daily start day 1 , Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 10 mg/m2/min ( 100 minute ) infusion day 1 follow day 2 oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 2-hour infusion . Treatment repeat every 2 week . Each two week cycle . Tumor response evaluation perform every 2 month . If tumor progress , patient study , disease stable PR , CR obtain continue treatment total 12 cycle . If end 12 cycle response continue , administer Gemox erlotinib till achieve maximum response . Then start Erlotinib maintenance therapy . Sample size : A total 34 patient need assume expect response great 10 % ( 27 % ) power = 80 % . Fourteen patient treat first stage ; one patient achieve PR additional twenty patient enrol study total 34 patient . Statistical Methods : Response rate 95 % CI median time progression disease calculate . Success declare low limit 95 % CI response rate great 10 % . The 95 % CI response rate calculate use exact method . Survival curve estimate use Kaplan-Meier Method . Descriptive statistic use describe patient demographic , adverse event , serious adverse event reason termination . Two approach efficacy safety analyse do ; ITT ( intent-to-treat ) efficacy analysis safety . The ITT analysis consist patient receive least one dose study drug least one on-treatment measurement primary efficacy endpoint ( overall response ) . The safety analysis consist patient receive least one dose study drug least one safety measurement do . A detailed description statistical method , table listing shell provide statistical analysis ( SAP ) database lock data transfer study biostatistician .</detailed_description>
