	<brief_summary>1 . Primary Objective : - To determine efficacy tolerability palonosetron dexamethasone prevent acute CINV brain tumor patient first 24 hour receive Irinotecan /Bevacizumab regimens . 2 . Secondary Objective - To determine safety tolerability palonosetron brain tumor patient . - To determine effect glucocorticoid anticonvulsant efficacy palonosetron . - To determine efficacy palonosetron dexamethasone prevent delay CINV brain tumor patient day 2-5 . - To determine patient receive palonosetron less fatigue baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aloxi Prevention Chemotherapy Induced Nausea Vomiting Malignant Glioma Patients Receiving Irinotecan With Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before patient receive palonosetron , physical exam blood test perform determine eligibility . If eligible willing , subject give Palonosetron intravenously . Subjects give Palonosetron Dexamethasone 30 minute first dose Irinotecan Bevacizumab chemotherapy . The total expected duration participation 57 day . Subjects also ask complete 4 questionnaire nausea vomiting , well daily function fatigue . Subjects ask complete questionnaire start chemotherapy , day start chemotherapy next 4 day receive chemotherapy , total 6 time . Subjects ask complete set questionnaires 3 time receive chemotherapy 6-week treatment cycle . The treatment subject would normally receive brain tumor routine care affect study .</detailed_description>
