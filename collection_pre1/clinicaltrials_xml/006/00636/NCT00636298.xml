	<brief_title>Study Cetuximab Bevacizumab Cancer Esophagus After Failure Patient 's First Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer esophagus often poor outcome since many patient advanced disease diagnose . The average survival rate five year increase 4 % 1970s around 14 % currently . Surgery remove tumor treatment radiotherapy alone lead disappointing result patient . Chemotherapy activity patient advance disease , although response usually short . New strategy try combine three treatment approach improve survival patient . This study test combination cetuximab bevacizumab patient locally advanced esophageal cancer . This group patient usually poor outcome treatment surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy alone . Scientifically , study help assess value combine two different type drug .</detailed_description>
