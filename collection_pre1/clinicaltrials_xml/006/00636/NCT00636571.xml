	<detailed_description>Using single-group , prospective design , potential participant identify screened eligibility PI ( LWJ ) via medical record review patient schedule primary adjuvant chemotherapy consultation DUMC Durham VA. As routine part clinical care , treatment consultation attend oncologist perform physical examination screen cardiovascular risk factor , result record patient ' medical record . Immediately follow consultation oncologist approval , potential participant provide thorough review study principal investigator ( LJ ) ask willing participate . Interested participant give information package provide information study participation . Two five day follow treatment consultation prior initiation chemotherapy , interested participant contact telephone PI answer question schedule baseline assessment visit . At baseline visit , participant ask sign informed consent give copy record . After consent , give baseline ECG physician monitor cardiopulmonary exercise test ( stress test ) screen undiagnosed cardiovascular disease . Following successful completion baseline assessment , participant schedule initial exercise training session . Finally , different group patient perform random retrospective medical chart review 50 completely-resected NSCLC patient receive usual care ( i.e. , exercise training ) study period obtain comparative information treatment toxicity/compliance rate . The chart review perform Drs . Jones , Garst Crawford ass treatment toxicity compliance entire course adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
