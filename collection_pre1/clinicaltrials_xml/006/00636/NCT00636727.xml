	<brief_summary>Many patient suffer disorder know temporomandibular joint dysfunction . This disorder jaw joint pain limited function key element . Many treatment advocate last 40 year , many deleterious . Currently treatment divide four category . The first non-surgical involves vocal rest , soft diet , heat , anti-inflammatory medication , muscle relaxant , splint therapy physical therapy . All patient benefit degree utilize one non-surgical approach . Controversy exist respect next three category treatment ideal . Some advocate arthrocentesis involve place two small needle joint allow irrigation instillation anti-inflammatory medication . This minimally invasive procedure perform local anesthetic alone intravenous sedation . Others advocate arthroscopy involves place arthroscope ( thin tube 2mm diameter optical element allow one see inside joint ) visualize inside joint . Furthermore joint irrigate , scar band remove , ligament stretch medication instill . This perform general anesthesia . Depending study , success arthrocentesis arthroscopy report 80-90 % . Still others recommend arthroplasty open joint surgical procedure allow surgeon enter joint directly repair remove damage cartilage disc within joint . This perform general anesthesia . Similar success rate 80-94 % report . It clear patient require arthrocentesis , others arthroscopy others arthroplasty . We currently real mechanism predict patient benefit procedure . This study enable patient undergoing procedure follow closely hope determine objective factor allow u stratify patient one three surgical option : arthrocentesis , arthroscopy arthroplasty . Our current approach empiric typically proceed arthrocentesis arthroscopy arthroplasty . All patient study offer opportunity arthrocentesis perform . It anticipate minority achieve long-term benefit term pain function . We hope able identify factor predict patient benefit future patient select arthrocentesis much high success rate . Patients fail improve arthrocentesis initially decline procedure offer opportunity undergo arthroscopy . It anticipate majority patient achieve long-term benefit term pain function . Again hop identify factor predict patient benefit future patient select arthroscopy even high success rate . Patients fail improve arthroscopy initially decline arthrocentesis arthroscopy offer opportunity undergo arthroplasty provide clinical radiographic evidence exist support presence either diseased displaced cartilage disc . Our ability adequately treat patient temporomandibular joint dysfunction significantly improve well stratify patient follow evidence base surgical algorithm provide great opportunity success reduce potential complication . Each surgical procedure standard care throughout USA unfortunately choice procedure perform often empiric guide train surgical experience .</brief_summary>
