	<brief_summary>Clinical trial identify intervention reduce adverse outcome fall nursing home ( NH ) resident attempt translate practice quality improvement ( QI ) techniques successful . Using complexity science framework , previous RO1 show low connection , information flow , cognitive diversity among NH staff explain quality care complex problem fall . Our pilot `` Connect , '' multi-component intervention encourage staff engage network-building use simple strategy make new connection others , enhance information flow , use cognitive diversity , suggest staff improve density quality interaction . This 5-year study use prospective , cluster-randomized , outcome assessment blind design , NHs ( n=16 ) randomize either Connect fall QI program ( Connect + Falls ) QI alone ( Falls ) . About 800 resident 576 staff participate . Specific aim , nurse home : 1 ) Compare impact Connect intervention plus fall reduction QI intervention ( Connect+Falls ) fall reduction QI intervention ( Falls ) fall risk reduction indicator ( orthostatic blood pressure , sensory impairment , footwear appropriateness , gait ; assistive device ; toileting need , environment , psychotropic medication ) ; 2 ) Compare impact Connect+Falls Falls alone fall rate injurious fall , determine whether mediated change fall risk reduction indicator ; 3 ) Compare impact Connect+Falls Falls alone complexity science measure ( communication , participation decision making , local interaction , safety climate , staff perception quality ) determine whether mediate impact fall risk reduction indicator fall rate injurious fall . Cross-sectional observation complexity science measure take baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month . Resident fall risk reduction indicator , fall rate , injurious fall measure 6 month prior first intervention 6 month final intervention complete . Analysis use 3-level mixed model account complex nesting patient staff within nursing home , control covariates associate fall risk , include baseline facility fall rate staff turnover rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although clinical trial identify intervention reduce adverse outcome fall nursing home ( NH ) resident , attempt translate intervention practice use current standard care quality improvement ( QI ) program [ 1 , 2 ] lead expected improvement . [ 3 , 4 ] Barriers encounter previous study point directly need effective nursing management practice ( NMPs ) . [ 1 , 3 , 5 ] Many study show relationship-oriented NMPs open communication , participation decision-making , teamwork , leadership result well resident outcome . [ 5-10 ] Our recent case-studies describe NMPs work day-to-day practice , identify new NMPs associate well NH care . We find staff level engage NMPs , albeit erratically , suggest NHs substantial untapped capacity provide good resident care . [ 11-15 ] Thus new intervention foster systematic use NMPs may provide foundation effective QI program . QI program current standard improve resident outcome common costly condition fall , pressure ulcer , pain , depression . Such geriatric syndrome inherently multifactorial , require modification multiple risk factor improve outcome . [ 16 , 17 ] Clinical trial use study staff implement multiple risk factor reduction improve resident outcome , [ 18-20 ] QI program teach exist NH staff implement multiple risk factor reduction show significant effect . [ 1 , 21-24 ] One propose reason failure QI program seek change individual clinician behavior fail account interactive dynamic care . We propose CONNECT , intervention foster systematic use NMPs , enhance effectiveness Falls QI program NHs strengthen one-on-one staff interaction necessary clinical problem-solving geriatric syndrome . We develop Connect intervention base complexity science empirical research [ 25 ] target local interaction among staff new approach facilitate organizational learning . Connect multicomponent intervention include : 1 ) help staff learn new strategy improve effectiveness day-to-day interaction ; 2 ) help staff identify important relationship encourage interaction point care ; 3 ) mentor reinforce sustain newly acquire interaction behavior . Complexity science empirical research suggest interaction pattern determine information flow , ease knowledge transfer , capacity monitor behavior outcomes health care setting . [ 10 , 26-28 ] Thus , Connect potential improve resident outcome combine QI program clinical problem fall . Falls excellent outcome initial test Connect : 1 ) ample evidence multifactorial risk factor reduction intervention effectively reduce fall rate NHs ; 2 ) accept practice guideline fall prevention program exist ; [ 29-32 ] 3 ) fall important clinical problem right . The specific aim longitudinal , two arm , randomize intervention study : Aim 1 : Compare impact Connect intervention plus fall reduction QI intervention ( Connect+Falls ) fall reduction QI intervention alone ( Falls ) fall-related process measure nurse home resident . Aim 2 ( exploratory ) : Compare impact Connect+Falls Falls alone fall-related outcome measure nurse home resident , determine whether mediated change fall-related process measure . Aim 3 ( exploratory ) : Compare impact Connect+Falls Falls alone staff interaction measure report NH staff , determine whether mediate impact fall-related process measure fall-related outcome measure . With focus improve local interaction , Connect innovative new approach target learn environment maximize NH staff 's ability adopt content learn Falls QI program integrate knowledge action . Our pilot work show Connect feasible , acceptable appropriate . Connect result empirical finding ; local interaction behavior already exist NHs , albeit limited extent way effectively enable staff adopt evidence-based current practice fall prevention inherent Falls approach . We confident NHs capacity exist develop focus behavior use exist staff resource , therefore , Connect intervention potential enhance effectiveness Falls promote adoption . Also , system intervention , Connect apply future project examine adoption evidence-based practice wide variety clinical problem pressure ulcer , pain , depression . This study offer unique opportunity understand circumstance prove intervention ( e.g. , Falls ) likely translate practice . Our future work build study establish correlate sustainability intervention NHs examine transferability clinical problem health care setting . The result research interest NH leadership policy maker , particularly light ongoing state national initiative improve care NHs .</detailed_description>
