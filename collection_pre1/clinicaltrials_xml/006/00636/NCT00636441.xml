	<brief_summary>This multi-center randomized Phase II study assign HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer patient receive preoperative systemic chemotherapy either `` genomic-guided '' arm `` non-guided arm . '' The `` genomic-guided '' method ( Arm 1 ) use genomic expression profile assign preoperative therapy ( Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide ( AC ) versus Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide ( TC ) , Arm 2 use random assignment two therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1 test arm difference pathological complete response rate . Secondary Objective 2 estimate test difference pathologic complete response rate drug-sensitive patient receive preferred drug drug-resistant patient randomize AC TC . Secondary objective include : determine 60 % cutoff genomic profile result large pathologic CR rate guide arm unguided arm ; compare pathologic CR rate patient whose genomic predictive probability indicate resistant chemotherapy regimens pathologic CR rate patient whose genomic predictive probability indicate sensitive one treatment randomly assign treatment resistant ( combine AC TC subgroup ) ; Secondary Objective 3 patient T2 T3 tumor classify require mastectomy baseline , compare guide non-guided treatment arm rate breast conserve surgery negative final margin ; Secondary Objective patient T2 tumor classify potential candidate breast conservation , compare guide non-guided arm rate breast conserve surgery first attempt ; Secondary Objectives 5 , 6 , 7 8 correlate genomic profile ( i.e. , genomic predictive probability ) clinical response , disease-free survival , sit recurrence , overall survival ; Secondary Objective 9 : compare mean cost guide versus non-guided treatment ; Secondary Objective 10 ass patient perception participate clinical trial evaluate cancer genomics preoperative systemic therapy early-stage breast cancer . Objective 10 detail : Due space limitation Outcome Measure Description field , detail supply : To assess patient motivation participation study participation clinical trial evaluate cancer genomics treatment patient provide response follow question baseline ( day chemotherapy start ) follow post-surgical medical oncology evaluation : One goal study tailor cancer treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor . How much knowledge treatment potentially tailor specifically tumor influence decision participate study ? ( Select One ) Response 1 : I know treatment tailor . Response 2 : I understand `` tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis `` tumor '' mean . Response 3 : The information tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor decrease willingness participate study . Response 4 : The information tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor neutral value decision make process participate study influence decision participate . Response 5 : The information tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor play minor role help decide participate study . Response 6 : The information tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor play major role help decide participate study . Response 7 : The information tailor treatment base upon genomic analysis tumor primary reason I decide participate study .</detailed_description>
