	<brief_title>Effects Infliximab Insulin Sensitivity Beta Cell Function Insulin Resistant Human Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity rapidly become one press health problem . Obese subject face increase risk cardiovascular event closely related cluster metabolic disturbance ( i.e . insulin resistance , hypertension , dyslipidemia impaired fibrinolysis ) , collectively refer syndrome X . The actual mechanism underlie development syndrome X elucidate . Increased TNF-alpha activity propose key factor . The objective study test whether neutralize TNF-alpha infliximab obese subject affect insulin resistance phenotypical manifestation metabolic syndrome : - fast plasma insulin - ivGTT derive parameter insulin resistance beta-cell function - total body fat - plasma lipid profile - vascular endothelial dysfunction</detailed_description>
