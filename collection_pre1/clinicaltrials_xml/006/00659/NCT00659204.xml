	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study compare antimicrobial efficacy silver nanoparticle gel commercialize alcohol-based hand gel bacterial count isolate hand 40 volunteer seed Serratia marcescens , surrogate microbial marker . Specific aim study : Aim # 1 : Compare immediate antimicrobial efficacy one-time application silver nanoparticle gel ( SilvaSorb , AcryMed , Inc. , Portland , OR ) versus alcohol-based hand gel ( Purell , GoJo Industries , Akron , OH ) reduce transient bacterial count isolate hand seed S. marcescens . Aim # 2 : Compare persistent antimicrobial efficacy one-time application silver nanoparticle gel ( SilvaSorb ) versus alcohol-based hand gel ( Purell ) 10 minute time frame produce persistent reduction transient bacterial count isolate hand seed S. marcescens . Aim # 3 : Compare user acceptability silver nanoparticle gel ( SilvaSorb ) versus alcohol-based hand gel ( Purell ) use self-assessment questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective randomized control , double blind , 2x3 experimental study evaluate antimicrobial efficacy silver nanoparticle gel compare alcohol-based hand gel bacterial count isolate hand 40 healthy , adult , military student volunteer . The study conduct two phase : first phase consist method development period second phase consist formal pilot study . For phase I , first four participant sample pool assign one two group ( nano-silver gel alcohol-based gel ) whereas Phase II , participant randomize one two group . Participants phase follow 7 day washout period subject refrain use antimicrobial product week prior test . Testing participant phase start baseline bacterial hand count . This accomplish use surrogate biomarker ( S. Marcescens ) . This microorganism select consider standard surrogate marker use hand hygiene evaluation produce characteristic red colony easily distinguishable normal microbial population hand make colony count accurate . Sampling bacterial flora accomplish utilize establish `` modify glove juice '' technique participant 's dominant hand place large sterile bag contain sample solution , remove surrogate bacteria . Once baseline sample collect , participant complete two additional random order timed condition involve surrogate biomarker one two test gel . For test condition , five mL solution withdrawn collection bag , dilute , plat , incubate 36 hour . For immediate efficacy testing , glove juice sample obtain 1 minute application gel . For persistent efficacy testing , glove juice sample obtain 10 minute application gel . To ensure biomarker remove , subject wash hand 70 % ethanol surgical handwash . The use UV-C light also implement 20 second additional precaution . Participants phase I additional glove juice sample end degerming validate protocol . All participant end study complete 4 question visual analog questionnaire determine user acceptability gel . The percent difference total bacterial count baseline use outcome variable . An unpaired Student 's t-test ( appropriate non-parametric test ) use data analysis study aim .</detailed_description>
