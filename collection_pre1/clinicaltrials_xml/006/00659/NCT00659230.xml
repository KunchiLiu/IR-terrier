	<brief_summary>This study propose multi-site , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial dopamine-ß-hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor , nepicastat , treatment posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) outpatients previously serve combat zone Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Enduring Freedom ( OIF/OEF ) Southwest condition since 19800 . A DBH inhibitor 's mechanism action decrease neuronal noradrenaline ( NA ) release inhibit DBH conversion dopamine ( DA ) NA . Animal model PTSD human study find substantial increase NA activity animal model PTSD human . Furthermore , recent clinical study improve PTSD hyper-arousal symptom reduce NA over-activity use agent like NA post-synaptic antagonist . Key support propose study base similar improvement PTSD symptom treatment DBH inhibitor , disulfiram . In experience clinical investigator , common chief complaint OIF/OEF veterans PTSD hyperarousal ( DSM-IV criterion D symptom cluster ) . These symptom significantly interfere social , occupational , interpersonal function . Standard treatment antidepressant fully effective treating symptom PTSD veteran ; thus , new treatment need . An intervention , nepicastat , aim reduce hyperarousal , well PTSD symptom , would significant impact restore overall function quality life OIF/OEF veterans PTSD . Since hyperarousal symptom respond relatively quickly medication type , study 120 outpatient veteran PTSD compare nepicastat 120 mg/day vs. placebo 6-week double-blind , randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) . The veteran follow additional 8 week RCT , , priori define positive clinical response study medication , nepicastat vs. placebo , continue study medication , order ass improvement safety . Those patient positive clinical response 6 week RCT offer addition standard first-line PTSD pharmacotherapy , paroxetine , 8 week extension phase . Thus , week 7-14 offer opportunity evaluate longer-term nepicastat efficacy compare treatment response nonresponders augmentation paroxetine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES Primary Hypothesis : Compared placebo treatment , nepicastat-treated OIF/OEF veteran PTSD significantly reduce PTSD hyperarousal symptom define Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [ CAPS ] , subscale D ( CAPS-D ) . Secondary Hypotheses : Compared placebo , nepicastat-treated OIF/OEF veteran PTSD : - Significantly reduce PTSD symptom ( total CAPS ) - Significantly reduce PTSD reexperiencing symptom ( CAPS-B ) - Significantly reduce PTSD avoidance symptom ( CAPS-C ) - Significantly high rate PTSD response remission - Significantly improve quality life Biomarker Hypotheses : - The NE ( norepinephrine ) DA ratios nepicastat-treated subject significantly low end study baseline assessment low end study placebo-treated subject . - Baseline NE DA ratios hyper-arousal symptom severity correlate . - Reduction baseline hyper-arousal symptom NE DA ratio PTSD patient positively correlate . This correlation may stronger nepicastat-treated subject placebo-treated subject .</detailed_description>
