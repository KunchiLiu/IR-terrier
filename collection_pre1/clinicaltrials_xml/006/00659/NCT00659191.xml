	<criteria>Parts A B : The subject healthy . Healthy determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test 12lead ECG . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Male female 18 55 year age . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) include female : Is premenopausal documented bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ( removal ovary ) hysterectomy , Is postmenopausal defined 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . A follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level perform confirm postmenopausal status . For study , FSH level &gt; 40 mlU/ml confirmatory . A male eligible enter participate study surgically sterile OR either agree abstain sexual intercourse female partner agree use condom/spermicide , addition female partner use another form contraception protocol Body weight &gt; / 50 kg ( 110 lb . ) men &gt; / 45 kg ( 99 lb ) woman body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18.531.0 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . A signed date write informed consent obtain subject subject 's legal representative prior screen . Subject must capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Part C : HIVinfected cohort : CD4 cell count &gt; / 200 cells/mm3 plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; / 5,000 copies/mL . Part C : HIVinfected cohort : A prebaseline viral load measurement obtain 714 day screen visit . The prebaseline viral load must within 0.7 log screen HIV1 RNA must meet screen HIV1 RNA ( i.e. , &gt; 5000 ) requirement subject include . As result medical interview , physical examination , screen investigation , Investigator considers subject unfit study . Has positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen ; positive hepatitis C ( HCV ) antibody detectable HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ; positive HIV1 antibody result . NOTE positive HIV1 antibody result acceptable entering study subject infect HIV1 ( Part C ) Has history regular alcohol consumption average &gt; 7 drinks/week woman &gt; 14 drinks/week men within 6 month screen visit . Note : 1 drink equivalent 12 g alcohol = 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . Unwilling abstain alcohol 48 hour prior start dose collection final pharmacokinetic sample treatment period . Unwilling refrain use illicit drug adhere protocolstated restriction participate study . The subject receive investigational drug participate research trial within 30 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose current study medication . Participation study would result donation blood excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Note : This include plasma donation . â€¢ History presence allergy intolerance study drug component drug class , history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . In addition , heparin use PK sample , subject history sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia enrol . Note : `` Study '' `` investigational '' drug include GSK1265744 placebo . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Subjects history cholecystectomy exclude . Exclusion criterion screen ECG outline protocol . Evidence previous myocardial infarction ( Does include ST segment change associate repolarization ) . Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , AV block [ 2nd degree high ] , WPW syndrome ) . Sinus Pauses &gt; 3 second . Any significant arrhythmia , opinion principal investigator GSK medical monitor , interfere safety individual subject . Nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( &gt; /3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) . The subject 's systolic blood pressure outside range 90140mmHg , diastolic blood pressure outside range 4590mmHg heart rate outside range 50100bpm female subject 45100 bpm male subject . History/evidence symptomatic arrhythmia , angina/ischemia , coronary artery bypass graft surgery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty clinically significant cardiac disease . History/evidence clinically significant pulmonary disease . Has history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month screen visit . The subject positive prestudy drug and/or alcohol screen . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include antacid , vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort iron supplement ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , total bilirubin value great upper limit normal . A single repeat allow eligibility determination . History significant renal hepatic disease . Exclusion Criteria 24Hour Screening Holter : Any symptomatic arrhythmia ( except isolate extra systole ) . Sustained cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation flutter , supraventricular tachycardia ( &gt; /10 consecutive beat ) , complete heart block ) . Nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( define &gt; / 3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) . Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right complete bundle branch block , atrioventricular ( AV ) block [ 2nd degree high ] , WPW syndrome etc. ) . Sinus Pauses &gt; 3 second . 300 supraventricular ectopic beat 24 hour . 250 ventricular ectopic beat 24 hour . An HIVinfected subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : An active Center Disease Control ( CDC ) Category C disease [ see Appendix 6 ] , except cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma require systemic therapy trial . Prior treatment integrase inhibitor ( &gt; / 1 dose ) . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2 time upper limit normal screening . A single repeat allow eligibility determination . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/uL , hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 50,000/uL creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute . A single repeat allow eligibility determination . History clinically relevant pancreatitis hepatitis within previous 6 month .
