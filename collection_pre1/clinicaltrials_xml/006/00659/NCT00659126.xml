	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use contrast imaging agent ferumoxytol work comparison standard image agent gadolinium measure tumor patient undergo treatment brain tumor tumor spread brain . Diagnostic procedure , MRI , may help find diagnose disease find far disease spread . MRI scan use radio wave powerful magnet link computer create detailed picture area inside body . The contrast imaging agent ferumoxytol consist small iron particle take blood stream brain area tumor . It highly visible MRI , may help visualize blood flow go tumor well gadolinium . Using sensitive faster 7 Tesla ( 7T ) magnet MRI conjunction contrast image agent may provide good way measure tumor 3 Tesla ( 3T ) magnet MRI patient brain tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare quantitative blood brain barrier permeability measurement ( derive transfer coefficient [ Ktrans ] ) standard gadolinium ( Gd ) MRI contrast agent 3T 7T use dynamic contrast enhancement ( DCE ) MRI . II . To compare dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) base perfusion measure 3T 7T . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe blood brain barrier permeability ferumoxytol ( ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite ) standard gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent use signal intensity change describe . II . To describe cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) measurement obtain use standard gadolinium MRI contrast agent ferumoxytol . III . To evaluate tumor microvascularity susceptibility-weighted image ( SWI ) . IV . To describe microscopic distribution ferumoxytol particle tissue remove subject undergoing surgery . OUTLINE : Patients assign 3T 7T magnet within subgroup . Patients receive gadolinium intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite IV day 2 . Patients undergo anatomical MRI sequence 3T 7T baseline day 1-3 . Patients also undergo DSC MRI DCE MRI day 1-2 . Day 1 day 2 imaging session may separate 7 day . After completion study , patient follow approximately 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
