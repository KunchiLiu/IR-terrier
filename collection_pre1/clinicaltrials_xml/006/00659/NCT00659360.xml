	<brief_title>AZD0530 Treating Patients With Recurrent Locally Advanced Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy AZD0530 , term disease control rate ( i.e. , response rate stable disease rate ) , patient recurrent locally advanced metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . II . To assess toxicity , time progression , response duration AZD0530 patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD0530 daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
