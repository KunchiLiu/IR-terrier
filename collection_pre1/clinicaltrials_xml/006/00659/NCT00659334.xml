	<brief_summary>Combidex ( ferumoxtran-10 ) ultra-small iron oxide particle cover sugar coat . It evaluate MRI contrast agent use image well perfuse organ liver spleen image lymph node . In study , Combidex use compare standard imaging agent , Gadolinium , image brain tumor area adjacent tumor location . Combidex may provide ability well see brain tumor inflammatory lesion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Combidex may useful ability cross blood vessel brain tumor , size ability get area next brain tumor , could assist treatment brain tumor drug future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit patient one neurology , neurosurgery neuro-oncology clinic OHSU . There four group study : - Subjects receive combidex infusion . - Subjects receive Combidex undergo previously schedule neurosurgery . - Subjects undergo surgery provide sample tumor tissue use pathology study Combidex . - Subjects MS stroke invite participate receiving Combidex evaluate effectiveness enhance area damage within brain . Subjects deem eligible study undergo baseline MRI within 28 day receive Combidex . Subjects receive Combidex admit half day Oregon Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute ( OCTRI ) . Combidex infuse I.V . 30 minute . Subjects monitor side effect discharge within 5 hour infusion , complication note . Subjects return 24 hour infusion post infusion MRI scan return one neurology clinic one month follow-up . Subjects enrol group 2 undergo surgery 1-2 day Combidex infusion also undergo 24 post infusion MRI return one month follow-up . These subject also follow closely neurosurgical physician course follow-up . Subjects enrol group 3 undergo surgery agree piece tumor resection biopsy donate use study . Group 4 group 1 , except patient population include multiple sclerosis stroke instead patient brain tumor .</detailed_description>
