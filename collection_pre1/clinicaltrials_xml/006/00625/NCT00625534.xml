	<brief_summary>Background : Large acceptance mesh reinforcement technique groin hernia repair lower recurrence rate technique . Recurrence rate alone main quality criterion hernia repair anymore . Chronic significant post operative pain common , clinically relevant , poorly understood poorly study entity 3 5 time common hernia recurrence . As subgroup chronic significant post operative pain separate entity , sexual dysfunction due ejaculatory genital pain inguinal hernia repair may happen approximately 2.5 % patient . Patient 's preoperative psychological profile well pain exposure history show important development chronic significant post operative pain . The objective study analyse chronic significant post operative pain functional outcome status patient laparoscopic repair compare open repair . Methods : A randomized control non-blinded clinical trial design compare open inguinal hernia mesh repair laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair chronic significant post operative pain , pain related sexual function disorder , complication , health relate quality life outcome , recurrence rate , cost . Volunteers recruit Geneva University Hospital , department surgery , visceral surgery unit . Eligibility criterion male patient age 21 year , reducible inguinal unilateral bilateral primary hernia candidate elective surgery medically fit general anesthesia.130 patient enrol group achieve Î±-Level 0.05 power 80 % . Follow-up take place 10th , 30th day well 3 12 24 post operative month questionnaires clinical exam independent expert . An overall cost-analysis realize .

	<brief_title>Functional Outcome After Groin Hernia Mesh Repair : Open Versus Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hernia repair frequent elective operation perform general surgery . Chronic pain persistent neuralgia recognize complication inguinal hernia repair report 1980s rare infrequent condition . Studies mid 1990s report high frequency , 50 % patient report pain hernia repair 1 year surgery . Chronic pain hernia repair disabling , considerable impact quality life . The natural history postoperative pain , include prevalence , etiology , duration , associate disability 's social economical impact remain undefined . The Cooperative Hernia Study ( 1996 ) assess postoperative pain prospective trial include 315 open non-mesh repair patient 2 year follow-up find 1 year , 62.9 % groin inguinal pain 11.9 % patient moderate severe pain ; 53.6 % pain 10.6 % patient continued report moderate severe pain 2 year postoperatively . In prospective consecutive case series study 500 consecutive operation 466 unselected adult patient open groin hernia repair Denmark ( 1994-1996 ) , 1 year surgery , 19 % patient degree pain , 6 % moderate severe pain . Pain restrict daily function 6 % patient . A cross-sectional cohort study base Danish Hernia Database ( 1998 ) determine incidence groin pain 1 year inguinal hernia repair assess influence chronic groin pain function , detect 28.7 % pain groin area 11.0 % patient report pain interfering work leisure activity . There difference incidence pain regard different type hernia , different type surgical repair , different type anesthesia . A questionnaire survey historical cohort 351 patient underwent inguinal hernia surgery Aberdeen - Scotland ( 1995-1997 ) report 30 % chronic pain . Character pain predominantly neuropathic . Definition chronic pain The definition `` chronic pain '' International Association Study Pain `` pain lasting 3 month '' . There consensus neither definition , severity grade CSPOP literature . In Cooperative Hernia Study , Cunningham et al . clearly described mild , moderate , severe pain . Mild pain define occasional pain discomfort limit activity , return lifestyle hernia ; moderate pain , pain prevent return normal preoperative activity ( i.e. , inability continue activity hernia golf , tennis , sport , inability lift object without pain , patient lift hernia occurrence ) ; severe pain , pain incapacitated patient frequent interval interfered activity daily live ( i.e. , pain constantly present , intermittently present severe impair normal activity , walk ) . Other study define chronic pain `` persist one year postoperatively '' . One Dutch study define pain pain groin scrotum last 1 month surgery . In study chronic pain define minimal score &gt; 4 use quadruple visual analogue scale ( VASQ ) 3 month procedure . Characteristics etiology chronic pain Somatic , neuropathic , visceral chronic pain syndrome describe . Cunningham et al . report somatic pain syndrome common type chronic post hernia pain . The pain localized common ligamentous insertion pubic tubercle . Somatic pain may due damage pubic tubercle staple mesh prosthesis deep muscle layer . Incorporation periosteum pubic tubercle medial suture open hernia repair accuse . Neuropathic pain probably attributable damage ilioinguinal genitofemoral nerve . Neuropathic pain usually develop sensory distribution injure nerve . Chronic residual neuralgia occur result surgical handing sensory nerve . The nerve trauma due partial complete division , stretch , contusion , crushing , electrical damage , suture compression . Secondary nerve damage occur due irritation compression adjacent inflammatory process granuloma . Neuropathic pain describe pulling , tug , tear , throb , stab , shoot , numb , dull . The onset neuropathic pain often delay , occur latent period day week . Pain often aggravate ambulation , stoop hyperextension hip sexual intercourse ; alleviate recumbent position flexion hip thigh . In laparoscopic hernia repair staple mesh , penetrate wall inguinal canal entrap irritate sensory nerve . Kinking nerve may cause chronic irritation . The third pain syndrome described literature visceral . For example , pain encountered ejaculation due dysfunction periurethral structure involve ejaculation . One possible mechanism injury either somatic sacral sympathetic nerve , result dyssynergia ejaculatory effector muscle . It also due stricture spermatic duct scar tissue twist cord . Prognosis chronic pain Once chronic pain instal , change without radical treatment . Cunningham et al . report prevalence mild , moderate , severe pain 63 % 1 year postoperatively , reduce 54 % 2 year . Those patient report moderate severe pain 1 year ( 12 % ) continue report persistent pain 2 year ( 11 % ) . Risk develop chronic pain - Predisposing psychological factor Preoperative psychological state patient ( Depression , dependency , drug consumption etc . ) history chronic pain previous surgery accident may predict factor . - Surgical factor Recurrent hernia , preoperative pain absence visible bulge surgery , delay onset symptom surgery , high pain score one week postoperatively requirement four week return work report risk factor develop chronic pain . Impact surgical technique Several different surgical technique study literature different meta analysis , different point interest , give different lecture reality . Despite fact consensus literature , surgical technique clearly one key parameter . The overall frequency chronic pain high study specific measurement , pain primary outcome interest . - OMR vs. non-mesh repair The hypothetical advantage tension free repair chronic pain issue confirm . Two retrospective cohort study come tenor open mesh repair , report less chronic pain mesh repair . This advantage mesh repair pain score versus conventional no-mesh repair confirm randomize control trial . - LR vs. OMR The study compare laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal ( TEP ) repair ( Polypropylene mesh without fixation ) classic OMR ( Lichtenstein ) come Kumar et al . They find overall 30 % `` chronic pain discomfort '' ( 22,5 % LR , 38,3 % OMR ) mean 21 month post hernia repair . Medical Research Council trial report significantly high incidence chronic pain open repair laparoscopic repair ( 37 % versus 29 % ) 1 year . This trial , however , include non-mesh repair open group transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAP ) TEP repair laparoscopic group . In meta-analysis randomize control trial laparoscopic open prosthetic mesh repair groin hernia , EU Trialists find chronic pain less likely occur laparoscopic repair open repair . - TEP TAP ? The TAP repair historically technique choice north america . Most literature compare TAP another technique . In technique , flat , heavy weight polypropylene mesh use fixed stapler tacker . Peritoneal tear also close technique . Higher rate chronic pain report TAP repair versus TEP repair . Nerve entrapment several stapling procedure probably main reason . TAP also strongly associate `` rare serious vascular visceral complication '' . The Medical Research Council trial report serious complication occur patient undergo TAP approach . Most postoperative complication sepsis bowel fistula mesh , mechanical ileus adherence port site hernia see TAP repair . In practice TEP repair technique choice . Dissection realize without use balloon dissector , anatomic , preformed anatomic polyester mesh implant without fixation stapling , tack suture .</detailed_description>
