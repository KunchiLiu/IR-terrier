	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , RAV12 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving RAV12 together gemcitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect best dose monoclonal antibody RAV12 give together gemcitabine treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine maximum tolerate dose monoclonal antibody RAV12 administer standard gemcitabine hydrochloride patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer . - To determine proportion patient survive 8 month initiation regimen . - To provide point estimate response rate duration response patient treat regimen . - To define toxicity profile drug patient administer standard gemcitabine hydrochloride . - To estimate , preliminarily , progression-free survival overall survival patient treatment regimen . - To explore utility tumor marker , carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9 ) , assessment patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study monoclonal antibody RAV12 , follow efficacy study . The study conduct two segment . - Segment 1 ( dose escalation RAV12 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 subsequent course . Patients also receive RAV12 IV weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 twice weekly day 1 , 4 5 , 8 , 11 12 , 15 , 18 19 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Segment 2 ( efficacy ) : Once MTD determine , patient receive RAV12 MTD gemcitabine hydrochloride segment 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample obtain pharmacokinetic sample dose-escalation segment study . Samples analyze determine plasma concentration RAV12 , gemcitabine hydrochloride , difluorodeoxyuridine . Blood sample also examine periodically expression serum biomarkers ( i.e. , CA19-9 , RAAG12 , HACA ) DNA analysis Fc-gamma receptor polymorphism . Archival paraffin block slide biopsy primary metastatic deposit fresh/frozen tissue may obtain baseline additional correlative study . Samples analyze immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) expression RAAG12 development companion RAAG12 diagnostic assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 8 week 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : This study accrue total 18 patient dose-escalation segment 63 patient efficacy segment trial .</detailed_description>
