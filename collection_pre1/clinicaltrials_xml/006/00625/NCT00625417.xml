	<brief_title>Optical Spectroscopy Evaluating Tumor Margins Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Breast Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To develop non-invasive detection tool evaluate breast tumor margin real-time guide tumor resection partial mastectomy procedure . - To conduct ex vivo optical spectroscopic study operate room breast tissue sample obtain immediately follow resection ass efficacy use tool differentiate breast tumor tumor margin normal breast tissue . OUTLINE : Breast tissue sample obtain immediately follow resection examine operating room use optical spectroscopy evaluate margin tissue . During spectroscopy , light , except surgical light , turn lateral , superior , medial , inferior , deep , anterior margin breast tissue sample examine use fiber-optic probe , nitrogen laser , broad band white light source . Reflectance fluorescence spectrum measure margin system operator . The measured margin immediately mark suture place surgeon . Additional margin may measure surgeon 's system operator 's discretion . The breast tissue sample deliver surgical pathology , shave biopsy perform suture-marked site provide direct correlation spectroscopy measurement tissue pathology . Data collect study , include spectral data , gross diagnosis patient 's tumor , histological identity specimen collect , keep research record least 6 year study finish .</detailed_description>
