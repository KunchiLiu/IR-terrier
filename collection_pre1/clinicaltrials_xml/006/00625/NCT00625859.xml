	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy male subject age 18 55 year inclusive . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 1935kg/m2 ( inclusive ) , minimum body weight 45kg . Subject must read write comprehension level sufficient provide write informed consent , able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . Subject provide informed consent participate study indicate provide sign dated write informed consent form prior initiation study procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : General Presence clinically relevant abnormality identify screen medical assessment , laboratory examination 12lead ECG , medical condition circumstance make volunteer unsuitable participation study . These include unstable medical disorder ; disorder would interfere action , absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion bupropion GSK189075 ; disorder may pose safety concern interfere accurate assessment safety efficacy . Laboratory Clinically significant abnormality Screening include : Systolic blood pressure outside range 90 140 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure outside range 50 90 mmHg , pulse rate rest &gt; 100 &lt; 45 bpm . Positive test hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , HIV . Positive cotinine , drug and/or alcohol test . Significant ECG abnormality define follow : Parameter Range Heart Rate &lt; 40 &gt; 100 bpm PR Interval &lt; 120 &gt; 220 m QRS duration &lt; 70 &gt; 120 m QTC Interval ( Bazett ) &gt; 450 m ALT , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin ³ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( Note : Subjects increase total bilirubin may enter study direct bilirubin within normal limit ) . Fasting triglyceride &gt; 400 mg/dL ( &gt; 11.3 mmol/L ) . Clinically significant abnormality T3 TSH . Serum creatinine clearance &lt; 60ml/min ( estimate serum creatinine ( SCr ) demographic data use MDRD calculation ) : A validated webbased calculator find : http : //nephron.com/cgibin/MDRDSIdefault.cgi To calculate estimate GFR ( mL/min/1.73m2 ) manually : = 186 x ( SCr mg/dL ) 1.154 x ( age ) 0.203 x ( 0.742 female ) x ( 1.210 AfricanAmerican ) = exp ( 5.2281.154 x ln ( SCr ) 0.203x ln ( age ) ( 0.299 female ) + ( 0.192 African American ) ) Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality determine Principal Investigator consultation GSK Medical Monitor . Central Nervous System Current diagnosis previous history mania , psychosis , major depression , major psychiatric disorder . Current past history seizure disorder brain injury ( traumatic diseaserelated ) ; condition , opinion investigator , predispose seizure ; treat medication treatment regime low seizure threshold ; undergoing abrupt discontinuation alcohol sedative ( include benzodiazepine benzodiazepinelike agent ) . Note : A single childhood febrile seizure exclusionary . History current diagnosis anorexia nervosa bulimia . Subjects , investigator 's judgement , pose homicidal suicidal risk , ever make suicide attempt , ever homicidal . Hepatic Gastrointestinal system History hepatic disease know hepatic biliary abnormality , ( exception previously document diagnosis Gilbert 's syndrome ) and/or history biliary gastrointestinal disorder , might affect absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug ( except appendectomy cholecystectomy 12 week prior study ) . Endocrine system Untreated unstable thyroid disease . Subjects take thyroid medication must stable dose regimen least 4 week prior first dose study drug completion Followup visit . Cardiac system Subject history clinically significant cardiac rhythm disorder QTc interval ³450 milliseconds Screening . Subject history ischemic heart disease , include stable/unstable angina acute myocardial infarction . Uncontrolled hypertension systolic blood pressure &gt; 140mm Hg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mm Hg . Drugs Alcohol Subject history alcohol abuse average weekly intake great 21 unit per week ( one unit = 1 glass wine = 1 measure spirit = ½ pint beer ) . Unwilling unable abstain use illicit drug adhere protocolstated restriction participate study . Use tobacco form ( smoke cigarette , cigar , and/or pipe , chew tobaccocontaining product ) , 4 week prior Screening completion Followup visit . Unwilling unable abstain use prescription nonprescription drug , vitamin , dietary/herbal supplement within 1 week prior first dose study drug completion Followup visit . Subject currently use medication may alter gastric/small bowel motility , result diarrhea , bind concomitant medication . For example , limit : erythromycin , antacid , prokinetic agent cholestyramine . Subject history drug allergy , opinion Principal Investigator , contraindicate participation study . • Concomitant medication usage include : Use agent know inhibit induce cytochrome P450 enzymes within 14 day prior first dose study medication , include grapefruitcontaining product St. John 's Wort . Use bupropion hydrochloride GSK189075 within last 6 month prior Screening . Use antidepressant medication clinically significant depression . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement within 7 day prior first dose Treatment Period 1 , unless opinion Investigator Sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Note : Occasional use acetaminophen ibuprofen accord direction provide product label may acceptable study , discretion Principal Investigator . Acetaminophen limit dos 2 grams/day ibuprofen dose 1.2 grams/day . Drug hypersensitivity History hypersensitivity WELLBUTRIN SR , ZYBAN , GSK189075 constituent closely related compound . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Other Past treatment new molecular entity ( investigational drug ) trial previous 30 day , 5 halflives , whichever longer . A new molecular entity define compound Phase 3 . ( The washout period 30 day count last dose study drug previous study first dose study drug ) . Participation study would result subject 's donation blood excess 500mL within 56day period .</criteria>
