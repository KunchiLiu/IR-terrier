	<brief_title>BETH Study : Treatment HER2 Positive Breast Cancer With Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab v Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab Plus Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , open-label trial determine whether regimen chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus bevacizumab improve invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) relative regimen chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . Secondary aim include determine whether addition bevacizumab chemotherapy plus trastuzumab improve disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , recurrence-free interval ( RFI ) , distant recurrence-free interval ( DRFI ) . The benefit add bevacizumab IDFS , DFS , OS , RFI , DRFI also evaluate two chemotherapy regimen . The cardiac non-cardiac toxicity regimens also evaluate . Following local determination tumor HER2-positive gene amplification situ hybridization IHC 2+ 3+ , tumor sample must submit HER2 test designated central laboratory . If central test confirms tumor HER2-positive ( either positive FISH IHC 3+ ) eligibility criterion meet , patient randomize regimen chemotherapy trastuzumab without bevacizumab . Patients trial enrol one two chemotherapy regimen cohort . One cohort receive 6 cycle docetaxel/carboplatin plus trastuzumab ( TCH ) without bevacizumab ; cohort receive 3 cycle docetaxel plus trastuzumab give without bevacizumab follow 3 cycle 5-Fluorouracil , Epirubicin , Cyclophosphamide ( TH-FEC ) . With regimen , patient continue trastuzumab without bevacizumab follow chemotherapy complete 1 year target therapy . Following completion chemotherapy , patient also receive adjuvant radiotherapy endocrine therapy clinically indicate . The trial conduct investigator affiliate Cancer International Research Group ( CIRG ) National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) . CIRG NSABP investigator enroll patient TCH regimen cohort . Additional investigator , refer protocol Independent Investigators , enroll patient TCH regimen TH-FEC regimen cohort depend institutional preference one regimen use institution duration trial . Patients give option allow tumor sample use BETH translational research correlative science study . Also , patient ask consent submission blood serum sample schedule time point study . LVEF assessment perform study entry schedule time point therapy 18 , 36 , 60 month follow randomization . The planned sample size trial 3,000 patient randomize faster accrue cohort minimum 3,500 patient overall .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Life expectancy least 10 year , exclude diagnosis breast cancer . Women breast reconstruction utilize tissue expanders must agreement delay surgery replace tissue expanders permanent implant 3 month follow last dose bevacizumab Women reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception ( example condom , intrauterine device , diaphragm , vasectomized partner , abstinence ) therapy least 6 month last dose bevacizumab and/or trastuzumab . Submission tumor sample breast surgery central HER2 testing required patient prior enrollment BETH Trial Signed date IRB/ECapproved consent ECOG performance status 0 1 The tumor must unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma breast histologic examination . The breast cancer must HER2positive base test result follow : Local testing ( available ) demonstrate tumor IHC 2+ 3+ consider HER2positive gene amplification FISH , CISH , situ hybridization ( ISH ) method . If local ISH test result consider equivocal , tumor submit central HER2 testing . ( If local test possible , tumor submit central HER2 testing . ) Central testing ( requirement ALL patient ) must demonstrate tumor HER2positive define FISHpositive and/or IHC 3+ . All follow stag criterion ( accord 6th edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual ) must meet : By pathologic evaluation , primary tumor must pT13 ; By pathologic evaluation , ipsilateral node must pN0 , pN1 ( pN1mi , pN1a , pN1b , pN1c ) , pN2a , pN3a , pN3b . If pN0 , least one follow criterion must meet : Pathologic tumor size &gt; 2.0 cm ; ER negative PgR negative ; Histologic and/or nuclear grade 2 ( intermediate ) 3 ( high ) ; Age &lt; 35 year Patients must undergo either total mastectomy breast conserving surgery ( lumpectomy ) . For patient undergo lumpectomy , margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) determine local pathologist . If pathologic examination demonstrate tumor line resection , additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin . If tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) , patient must undergo total mastectomy eligible . ( Patients margin positive lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible without additional resection . ) For patient undergo mastectomy , margin must free gross residual tumor . Patients microscopic positive margin eligible . Patients must complete one follow procedure evaluation pathologic nodal status : Sentinel lymphadenectomy follow removal additional nonsentinel lymph node sentinel node ( SN ) positive ; Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone pathologic nodal stag base sentinel lymphadenectomy pN0 , pN1mi pN1b ; Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure .
