	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Selenomethionine may slow growth tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together With selenomethionine radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well selenomethionine work give together capecitabine , oxaliplatin , radiation therapy treat patient undergo surgery newly diagnose stage II stage III rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Oxaliplatin , Selenomethionine , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery For Newly Diagnosed Stage II III Rectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine complete pathological response rate combination capecitabine , oxaliplatin , selenomethionine , radiotherapy patient stage II III rectal adenocarcinoma . - To determine T-downstaging rate regimen patient stage II III rectal adenocarcinoma . Secondary - To determine safety regimen assess toxicity dose intensity various component regimen . - To determine rate local relapse . - To determine rate distant relapse . OUTLINE : Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy comprise oral selenomethionine twice daily 1 week prior radiotherapy daily 6 week . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1-7 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 6 week undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 4-8 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo curative-intent surgery . Beginning 4-8 week surgery , patient may receive 9 course standard adjuvant combination chemotherapy ( FOLFOX ) . Blood sample collect baseline weekly treatment analyze absorption spectrophotometry selenium measurement drug concentration . Pharmacokinetic study also perform . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
