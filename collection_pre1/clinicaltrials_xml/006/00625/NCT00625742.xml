	<brief_summary>The primary aim proposal present novel , multimodal treatment strategy increase lean body mass individual cancer experience cachexia baseline day 29 ( +/- 3 day ) . The strategy include grade resistance training aerobic exercise , target nutrient supplementation pharmacologic intervention ( melatonin ) . We postulate strategy , together simultaneous management symptom decrease appetite ( e.g . depression , pain , nausea ) , also accomplish secondary objective improve clinical outcome strength function baseline day 29 ( +/- 3 day ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Melatonin hormone help reduce inflammation poor food absorption cause cancer . It may also enhance effect ibuprofen . Juven nutritional supplement design help build muscle slow muscle breakdown . Screening Tests : Before start treatment study , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test perform : - Blood ( 1 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - Additional blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check thyroid function level two B vitamin , check within past 3 month . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - Your rest energy expenditure ( energy use rest ) measure . calorie-measuring device . For test , breathe mouth 10 minute allow calorie-measuring device measure oxygen body use , calculates much energy body use rest . - You ask fill questionnaire rate overall physical well-being , another questionnaire rate level fatigue , third questionnaire rate experience 10 common symptom past 24 hour ( pain , fatigue , nausea , depression , anxiety , drowsiness , shortness breath , change appetite , sleep difficulty , feel well ) . In total , questionnaire take 30 minute complete . - You complete diary entry list food drink last 3 day . It take 10 minute complete . - Your strength stamen evaluate . This measure hand-grip pinch strength test do hand . These test see hard grip device hand pinch pad another device call pinch gauge . These test do 3 time best score use . Your strength stamen also check use Get-Up-and-Go test 6-minute walk test . The Get-Up-and-Go test measure long take get sit chair arm , walk 10 foot , turn around walk back chair , sit . The 6-minute walk test measure distance walk 6 minute 100-foot loop . You walk 50 foot turn walk back begin . You walk speed feel comfortable many time 6 minute . - Blood ( 1 2 tablespoon ) draw check marker inflammation nutrition status . Study Drug Administration : You take one ( 1 ) 20mg capsule melatonin every night . It take without food . It take 8 ounce ( 1 cup ) water . You drink 90 calorie Juven , twice day . Juven powder supplement mix 8 ounce water . It available orange grape flavor . You also instruct increase daily calorie intake least 1,000 calorie . To assist , dietary advice give nurse physician . Exercise Training : You complete 2 exercise training session week . The session combine resistance grade aerobic training . Resistance training ( Thera-bands ) design increase muscle-building effect hormone call testosterone . Thera-bands rubber band hold put around foot provide resistance muscle bend flex arm legs . You instruct 3 upper-body exercise ( chest press , shoulder press , arm pull ) 3 lower-body exercise ( leg press , leg extension , leg flexion ) . At first visit , physician educate make sure exercise do correctly . Each repetition take 12 second complete ( 6 second bend , 6 second straighten arm leg ) . When 6 repetition complete , next week 's set increase 1 repetition . Graded aerobic exercise walking/running program may help exercise longer . Graded aerobic exercise involve walk run 3-4 minute 70-80 % maximum predicted heart rate . There 3-minute warm-up 3-minute cool-down exercise . During first visit , show monitor heart rate exercise 70-80 % maximum heart rate . You add 1 minute aerobic exercise start week . You receive customize aerobic resistance exercise program base range motion risk fall , evaluate study staff . If experience chest pain , temperature 100.4 °F , platelet count lower certain level , fresh bruise , shortness breath rest , advise stop exercising relieve . Evaluations : While study , within 3 day day list , follow measurement monitor : - Your lean body mass weight check Days 15 29 use Tanita TBF-310 body composition analyzer/scale . For measurement Tanita TBF 310 , ask wear light clothes take shoe sock weigh . You stand special scale send extremely low-energy , high-frequency electrical signal one foot foot . You able feel . - Your muscle mass ( mid-arm muscle area ) measure special tape . - The thickness skin fold triceps ( back upper arm ) measure 3 time use skin fold caliper . Calipers gentle clamp-like device use outside body measure skin thickness . - At Day 29 , rest energy expenditure measure . - On Days 15 29 study cycle , complete 3 questionnaire screen . - Your caloric intake measure Days 15 29 . - Your strength stamina evaluate Days 15 29 . - On Day 29 , blood ( 1 2 tablespoon ) draw check marker inflammation nutrition . - Blood ( 1 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 15 day on-study . You also fecal occult blood test time . Length Study : You study 29 day ( 1 cycle ) . This investigational study . Melatonin Juven commercially available nutritional supplement exempt FDA approval . However , patient cancer cachexia , study treatment ( resistance training , aerobic exercise , use Juven , melatonin ) consider experimental . At time , use research . Up 40 patient enrol study . Up 30 patient enrol M.D . Anderson , 10 enrol University Alabama-Birmingham .</detailed_description>
