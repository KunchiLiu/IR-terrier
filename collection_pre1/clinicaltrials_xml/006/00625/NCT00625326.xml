	<brief_title>Study Dose-Effect COL-121 Ointment Patients With Plaque-Type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis affect 7 million Americans . Plaque-type psoriasis ( common type psoriasis ) inflammatory skin condition reactive abnormal epidermal differentiation hyperproliferation . It characterize raise , thicken , plaques erythematous skin cover silvery-white scale . Plaque-type psoriasis commonly find knee , elbow , scalp appear anywhere body . While patient psoriasis may complain itchiness discomfort , psychological effect disease debilitate . In 1998 survey conduct National Psoriasis Foundation , find 79 % psoriasis patient survey report disease negative impact live 40 % felt frustrated ineffectiveness current therapy . Although exact cause skin disease unknown , clear immune-based inflammatory mechanism initiate accelerated growth skin cell . This accelerated growth result agglomeration skin cell surface epidermis body shed . This agglomeration create thickened patch scaly skin characteristic disease . Clinical use systemic vitamin D treat psoriasis limit induction hypercalcemia . In contrast , low dos topically administer vitamin D analog show anti-psoriatic effect without risk hypercalcemia . Topical vitamin D analogs ability inhibit proliferation promote differentiation keratinocytes psoriatic skin . In addition , vitamin D analog may also act inhibit cytokine production keratinocytes lymphocytes . Calcipotriol , thoroughly study vitamin D analog , first approve Europe early 1990s . It show comparable slightly effective class II corticosteroid ointment . In patient extensive psoriasis , calcipotriol ointment show effective . However , patient reduce level parathyroid hormone ; mean serum urine calcium increase treatment hypercalciuria record 3 patient . These effect reversible discontinuation therapy . In review effect calcium homeostasis , note calcipotriol ( 50 Âµg/g ) effect serum urine calcium administer dose 40-50 g/week two report hypercalcemia dose 70-100 g/week . Thus , calcipotriol ointment show effective , potential alteration calcium homeostasis limit use 100 g ointment per week ( 0.5 mg calcipotriol/week ) . Subsequently , calcipotriol tacalcitol , another vitamin D analog , become first-line therapy management `` mild moderate '' psoriasis several country Western Europe , Japan USA . Work continue creation new vitamin D analog , COL-121 , intent eliminate adverse effect hypercalcemia hypercalciuria compound stable easily administer .</detailed_description>
