	<brief_summary>Background : Midline incisional hernia report 0,5 11 % abdominal operation . Primary repair without mesh reinforcement almost abandon high recurrence rate ( 24 46 % ) . Use prosthetic mesh incisional hernia repair lower recurrence rate 10 % . Recurrence rate alone main quality criterion incisional hernia repair anymore . Large series meta-analyses confirm value laparoscopic repair least equal good compare open repair . Discomfort , pain , diminish quality life body image alteration influence functional well . No baseline information exist field treat pre- post-operative phase patient incisional hernia . Respiratory function medico-economic evaluation rarely investigated field consider trial . The objective study analyse functional outcome status patient laparoscopic incisional hernia repair compare open repair . Methods : A randomized control non-blinded clinical trial design compare laparoscopic incisional hernia mesh repair open repair post operative pain , health relate quality life outcome , body image cosmetic measurement , respiratory function , recurrence rate , cost . Volunteers recruit Geneva University Hospital , department surgery , visceral surgery unit . Eligibility criterion male patient age 18 year , reducible incisional hernia candidate elective surgery medically fit general anesthesia.30 patient enrol group . Follow-up take place 10th , 30th day well 3 12 24 post operative month questionnaires clinical exam independent expert . An overall cost-analysis realize .

	<brief_title>Functional Outcome After Incisional Hernia Repair : Open Versus Laparoscopic Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Midline incisional hernia report 0,5 11 % abdominal operation . Discomfort , pain , body image alteration diminish quality life influence functional well . Alteration pulmonary function , risk visceral incarceration cutaneous complication potential medical complication . Primary repair without mesh reinforcement almost abandon high recurrence rate ( 24 46 % ) . Recurrence rate prosthetic repair publish series vary 4 % 29 % . Different technique mesh placement variety mesh fixation material explain wide range recurrence rate nevertheless , large series standardize technique report le 4 % recurrence rate . Laparoscopic repair incisional hernia first publish 1993 . Following report large personal series recent year evolution adapt materiel , technique gain popularity . The main difference open laparoscopic technique reconstruction abdominal wall . In open technique , abdominal wall reconstruct ( hernia edge bring together ) reinforcement abdominal wall mesh insert onlay , sublay inlay . In laparoscopic repair , fascial defect leave in-situ reinforced mesh , overlap largely edge hernia . Advocated advantage laparoscopy : less abdominal wall dissection ( less surgical complication ) , tension-free mesh repair ( suture ) , less postoperative pain , less respiratory complication , short hospital stay , fast return professional activity . Disadvantages attribute laparoscopic repair steep learning curve , high material cost , long operation time rare serious complication . Large series meta analysis confirm value laparoscopic repair least equal good compare open repair . Most trial focus recurrence , complication rate , hospital stay sick leave . Only recently , quality life pain start evaluate . No valuable data exist chronic pain persistent neuralgia , body image , cosmesis neuroticism neither open laparoscopic repair . Chronic pain persistent neuralgia recognize complication inguinal hernia repair report 1980s rare infrequent condition . Studies mid 1990s report high frequency , 50 % patient report pain hernia repair 1 year surgery . Chronic pain hernia repair disabling , considerable impact quality life . The natural history postoperative pain , include prevalence , etiology , duration , associate disability 's social economical impact remain undefined . We know experience inguinal hernia chronic pain need investigate scrupulously identify . 20 27 % chronic pain associate open repair series without specific questionnaire . Overall frequency chronic pain high study specific measurement , pain primary outcome interest . Preoperative psychological state patient ( depression , dependency , drug consumption etc . ) history chronic pain previous surgery accident may predict factor . The definition `` chronic pain '' International Association Study Pain `` pain lasting 3 month '' . There consensus neither definition , severity grade CSPOP literature . In study chronic pain define minimal score &gt; 4 use quadruple visual analogue scale ( VASQ ) 3 month procedure . Somatic , neuropathic chronic pain syndrome describe . Neuropathic pain usually develop sensory distribution injure nerve . Chronic residual neuralgia occur result surgical handing sensory nerve . The nerve trauma due partial complete division , stretch , contusion , crushing , electrical damage , suture compression . Secondary nerve damage occur due irritation compression adjacent inflammatory process granuloma . Neuropathic pain describe pulling , tug , tear , throb , stab , shoot , numb , dull . The onset neuropathic pain often delay , occur latent period day week . Pain often aggravate ambulation sexual intercourse . Once chronic pain instal , change without radical treatment . Preoperative psychological state patient ( Depression , dependency , drug consumption etc . ) history chronic pain previous surgery accident may predict factor . The definition `` Body image '' give person 's perception , satisfaction , attitude toward body general particular area body . Little known subjective feeling cosmetic consequence scar patient undergo either conventional laparoscopic abdominal surgery . Few data report body image patient cancer , particular mutilate operation mastectomy . Three paper ileocolectomy , proctectomy live donor nephrectomy publish Dutch group , compare laparoscopy laparotomy . Body image presence incisional hernia certainly degrade surgery , unfortunately baseline data exists date . Therefore , hypothetic , relative , significant improvement body image laparoscopic treatment compare open repair need evaluate . The standard open technique institution two declination , first technique retromuscular sublay second , open onlay mesh repair . In technique fascial defect close suture repair mesh reinforcement . Superiority one technique compare another prove , properly do , achieve low recurrence rate . Laparoscopic technique need meet widely accept good-practice principle : complete adhesiolysis abdominal wall viscera , use specific bilayer mesh ( non adherent visceral surface ) , coverage totality previous scar length least 5cm overlap , adequate fixation .</detailed_description>
