	<brief_summary>This study look use take tumor mixed special immune stimulating cell another person 's blood give back series `` fusion cell '' injection , effect body . The primary goal study see give experimental fusion cell injection safe . We also look see effect experimental treatment immune system whether effect cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Assess Safety Efficacy Vaccinations With Allogeneic Dendritic Cells : Autologous Tumor-Derived Cells Subjected Electrofusions Patients With AJCC Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo tumor aquisition short-term tumor cell culture establish . Leukopheresis perform monocyte-derived DC generate ex-vivo standard culture technique , utilize GM-CSF Il-4 . PEG fusion generate , follow irradiation , vaccine frozen . The thawed vaccine administer SC single site every three week . Each study examine dose-escalating strategy base apon number PEG-fused generated PEG process express tumor cell DC marker determine immune staining .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must _ &gt; 18 year age The patient must diagnose AJCC stage IV ( primary relasped ) RCC The patient must baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Clinical performance 01 The patient must accessible tumor ( minimum 2.5cm diameter aggregate accessible ) vaccine production The patient must measurable tumor lesion ( use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) follow resection tumor lesion ( ) use vaccine production . If patient receive previous radiation intratumoral investigational treatment , measurable disease must outside previous radiation port treatment area unless document tumor progression follow completion therapy . The patient must adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function parameter within 21 day prior first vaccination ( day 0 treatment ) : White blood cell ( WBC ) count &gt; _ 3,000 cell/mm3 Platelet count &gt; _ 100,000 platelets/mm3 Creatine ( serum ) &lt; 2.0mg/dL Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase ( SGPT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.0 x Upper limit normal Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 2.0 x Upper limit normal The patient must serologically negative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 , HIV2 , human T lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) 1 Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test , refrain nursing must agree ton use appropriate contraception duration trial The patient must sign date write informed consent prior study procedure . The consent process must document patient 's medical record The patient receive prior chemotherapy The patient 's tumorderived cell meet predetermine manufacture specification , example : human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) Class 1 molecule expression , sufficient tumor derive cell vaccine manufacture , pathologic confirmation RCC The patient receive 2 prior regime treatment RCC recent within 2 week first screen procedure The patient receive radiation therapy within 2 week first sceeening procedure The patient clinically significant autoimmune diorder The patient active infection time first screening procedure require parenteral antibiotic The patient clinically significant hematolgic , cardiac , renal , hepatic disease underlying condition would contraindicate study therapy confuse interpretation study result The patient active clinically significant central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases The patient previous unrelated malignancy second malignancy within 5 year prior first screening procedure , except nonmelanoma skin cancer situ carcinomas The patient receive chronic immunosuppressive , and/or oral steriod treatment The patient reason Investigator 's opinion would make protocol compliance unmanageable may compromise patient 's ability give inform consent The patient treat nononcologic investigational drug , biologic medical device within 30 day first screen procedure</criteria>
