	<brief_title>Biological , Genetic , Lifestyle Risk Factors Developing Colorectal Adenomas Polyps Participants Undergoing Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To recruit 7,000 participant plan undergo colonoscopy . - To collect questionnaire medical record participant . - To collect biological sample , include urine , blood , buccal cell and/or saliva , rectal tissue , colorectal polyp participant . - To evaluate risk factor difference participant find polyps polyp . OUTLINE : Participants undergo screen colonoscopy removal polyp . Within 1 month colonoscopy , participant undergo 30-minute telephone interview and/or complete mail survey provide information lifestyle medical history may relate colorectal polyp risk . Participants undergo removal polyp colonoscopy also complete 20-minute survey 3-year follow-up colonoscopy . Participants ' medical record may also review . Blood sample collect time colonoscopy . Some participant may also provide blood sample 1-2 week prior colonoscopy . Tissue bisect portion colorectal polyp &gt; 5 mm size remove colonoscopy also obtain . Some participant may also undergo normal colorectal tissue sample saliva sample collection time colonoscopy urine sample collection 2 day prior , , and/or 8 week colonoscopy . Tissue sample may store future genetic study evaluate genetic factor may cause related colon polyp colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
