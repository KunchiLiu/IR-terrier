FP253 contain ovine atadenovirus express E. coli enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) control prostate-directed promoter . PNP convert systemically administer fludarabine ( prodrug ) 2-fluoroadenine ( active agent ) site FP253 administer ( prostate ) . This localized conversion expect provide organ-targeted chemotherapy reduce systemic side effect associate classical chemotherapy also reduce risk debilitate damage tissue surround prostate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The primary objective study determine safety tolerability FP253 prostate cancer . FP253 contain ovine atadenovirus express E. coli enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) control prostate-directed promoter . SUBJECT POPULATION : Up eighteen male subject ( 6 group 3 subject ) histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate , still prostate situ , evidence progressive disease despite continuous androgen deprivation therapy meet eligibility criterion , enrol study . STUDY DESIGN : This study design open-label , dose escalation trial patient cohort receive single define dose . Subjects enrol consecutively 6 escalate dose group 3 subject . Each subject receive treatment outline protocol follow 2 year regular interval life , define current standard care . TREATMENT : Subjects administer single injection FP253 follow five dos Fludarabine phosphate outline Intervention section . SAFETY PARAMETERS : Adverse event record physical examination , 12-lead ECG , vital sign monitoring , urinalysis collection blood sample pathology laboratory test perform regular interval study monitor safety . The shed viral vector monitor per regulatory requirement negative . ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS : In order ass haematological immunological effect novel agent effect tumour response survival , follow assess : - Biochemical Haematological Markers : include Prostate-Specific Antigen , - Immunopathological Markers : include haematological marker indicator cytotoxicity , - ECOG assessment , - Assessment disease progression survival . DATA ANALYSIS : Descriptive statistical method use summarize key data include demographic , vital sign measurement , ECG parameter , clinical laboratory parameter , immune response , tumour response , adverse event concomitant medication . The general strategy safety analysis examine data summary trend safety parameter across dose level . No formal hypothesis test . A formal data analysis perform subject complete study period ( 28 day ) interim analysis perform first 3 dose cohort complete . For first year , three monthly follow report produce follow 6 monthly report second year final follow report subject complete 2 year follow . Descriptive statistical method use summarise key data include demographic , vital sign measurement , ECG parameter , clinical laboratory parameter , immune response , tumour response , adverse event concomitant medication . The general strategy safety analysis examine data summary trend safety parameter across dose level . No formal hypothesis test .</detailed_description>
