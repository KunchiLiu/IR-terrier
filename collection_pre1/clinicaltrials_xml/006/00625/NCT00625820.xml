	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) albuminuria increase risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) often associate hypertension , leave ventricular hypertrophy , endothelial dysfunction increase generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . These patient also manifest decrease nitric oxide ( NO ) availability think play important role progressive vascular disease . Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , essential cofactor endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , important regulator NO key mediator endothelial dysfunction . Changes NO availability believe contribute endothelial dysfunction see CKD common CVD state . 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin ( 6R-BH4 sapropterin dihydrochloride ) investigational oral drug evaluate determine whether restore NO availability , lead beneficial effect vascular function ultimately positive clinical outcome patient CKD . The primary endpoint study level albuminuria , easily measure marker serve predictor kidney disease progression . If 6R-BH4 reduces albuminuria patient kidney disease , may implications slow disease progression well decrease risk CVD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Background : Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) characterize high propensity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) ; therefore treatment impact CKD CVD need . CKD accompany endothelial dysfunction nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency . Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , important co-factor endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) increase availability NO . Administration BH4 potential improve endothelial function thereby reduce albuminuria CKD . Patients Methods : This Phase 2 open-label study design ass efficacy safety twice daily oral dose 6R-BH4 30 subject CKD ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) â‰¥40ml/min/1.73m2 ) . Trial Design : Subjects receive 6R-BH4 400mg bid 6 week , sequentially follow 6R-BH4 plus Vitamin C 500mg bid another 6 week . Patients schedule visit Weeks 0,3,6,9 12 , exit-visit week 16 . Albuminuria assess 24-hour urine collection well early morning spot urine sample albumin : creatinine ratio . Blood urine test routine clinical laboratory test , blood NO , also archive later assay special biomarkers . The primary outcome level albuminuria measure 24-hour urine collection 6 12 week therapy . Secondary outcome include urine albumin/creatinine ratio , eGFR , blood pressure . Adverse event monitor closely . Data analysis : For patient combine outcomes , sequentially compare time point baseline level use paired t-tests . For comparison 6R-BH4 versus 6R-BH4+vitamin C , compare albuminuria 6 12-weeks , adjusted baseline value , use regression analysis . We also use regression test interaction baseline value treatment group . Anticipated result : We postulate 6R-BH4 alone conjunction high dose vitamin C reduce albuminuria patient CKD improvement endothelial function integral glomerular filtration . Future Implications : Reduction albuminuria demonstrable , implication simultaneous renal cardiovascular protection . This need confirm large randomize control clinical trial subject CKD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients control hypertension ( blood pressure ( BP ) less 150/90 mmHg ) use standard antihypertensive medication . Stable chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 4090 ml/min/173m2 abbreviate Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation rate decline eGFR great 1ml/min/1.73m2 per month prior 3 month albuminuria ( urine albumin excretion 24hr urine sample 3003000mg ) . No concomitant use : Vitamin C supplement Multivitamins contain vitamin C Any dietary supplement , nutraceuticals , overthe counter product contain vitamin C Vitamin E contain supplement Concurrently take study approve antihypertensive medication stable dose least 3 month prior screen . Sexually active subject must willing able use acceptable method contraception Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Females consider childbearing potential include menopause least 2 year , tubal ligation least 1 year prior screening , total hysterectomy . Uncontrolled hypertension BP great 150/90 frequent change antihypertensive regimen last 3 month . Concurrent disease condition would interfere study participation safety , bleed disorder , history syncope vertigo ; severe gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) gastric ulcer ; heart failure ; symptomatic coronary peripheral vascular disease ; arrhythmia ; serious neurologic disorder , include seizure ; organ transplant . Diabetics uncontrolled , unstable , newly diagnose , undergone major change therapy last three month HbA1C consistently great 9.0 . Any severe comorbid condition would limit life expectancy le 6 month . Advanced stage III CKD worse , i.e . eGFR less 40 ml/min/1.73m2 ( abbreviate MDRD formula ) . History nephrolithiasis . Patients albuminuria due cause hypertension /or diabetes ; e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . Hepatic enzyme concentration great 2 time upper limit normal . HIV infection , hepatic cirrhosis , preexist liver disease , positive HIV , Hepatitis B C test screening . Concomitant treatment drug know inhibit folate metabolism , Levodopa , phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 5 inhibitor PDE 3 inhibitor . Myocardial infarction , stroke , surgery within last 60 day prior screen . History alcohol and/or drug abuse . Pregnant breastfeed screening , plan become pregnant ( subject partner ) time study . Previous treatment tetrahydrobiopterin ( 6RBH4 ) . Has know hypersensitivity 6RBH4 excipients . Any condition , view principal investigator ( PI ) , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study .</criteria>
