Low HRV occur patient PTSD , General Anxiety Disorder , Coronary Artery Disease , correlate negative affect hostility . HRV Biofeedback train show effective increase HRV group patient , well improve psychological well-being physiological function patient Depression , Fibromyalgia , Cardiovascular Disease . Therefore , interrelationship HRV ATTN/IM problem PTSD+ Combat veterans warrant investigation . If HRV Biofeedback significantly improve ATTN/IM subject , offer VA clinician treat combat PTSD effective new treatment tool .</brief_summary>
