	<brief_summary>The purpose study : To assess whether difference antibody persistence eight month post primary ( pre−booster ) responses booster regard Meningococcal C Conjugate ( MCC ) vaccine give infancy . To examine level diphtheria tetanus antibody pre− post−booster , regard carrier protein contain conjugate vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Immune Response United Kingdom ( UK ) Infants Receiving DTaP/Hib/IPV , Meningococcal C Conjugate Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines , Antibody Persistence Responses Booster Doses Second Year Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There well recognised benefit reduce number injection include immunisation programme , particularly infant delivery many antigen first month life essential provide protection deadly diseases . Reducing number injection would reduce distress infant , parent healthcare worker , make schedule cost effective possible would give great flexibility include vaccination novel antigens future . The UK recommend immunisation schedule 13 month age revise 4 September 2006 infant receive three dos Pediacel ( diphtheria , tetanus , whooping cough , Hib polio contain vaccine ) , two dos Prevenar ( pneumococcal vaccine , PNC ) two dos meningococcal C vaccine , MCC , one three licensed product , Meningitec , Menjugate NeisVacC . Previous study however show three MCC product behave quite differently give vaccine different dose schedule . To end two product seem viable single dose option UK schedule , Menjugate NeisvacC , include study . Assessment absolute number dos vaccine need protect disease essential maximising efficiency schedule study examine dose requirement meningococcal C conjugate ( MCC ) vaccine data suggest would possible , publish peer review literature ongoing study conduct group . This study first test accelerate UK schedule presence pneumococcal conjugate vaccine . This study also include booster phase child receive dose MCC , PNC Hib second year life accordance national schedule . There need booster second year life increase circulate antibody drop significantly year age . As expect , responses boost show significantly high achieve primary immunisation variation product follow similar pattern see primary series . The current study design allow assessment single dose MCC vaccine give three month age two product show potential afford protection ongoing study . In previous study first dose give two month age response tend improve age anticipate single dose give later result high antibody see study . The aim study provide data base decision reduction MCC vaccination infancy two dos single dose would afford benefit discuss .</detailed_description>
