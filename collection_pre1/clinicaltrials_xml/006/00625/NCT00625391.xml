	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis major health problem postmenopausal woman . Our long-term goal develop new alternative treatment include dietary supplement ( green tea extract ) mind-body exercise ( Tai Chi ) lessen bone loss postmenopausal woman low bone mass . A combination dietary supplement moderate intensity exercise become new alternative treatment reduce bone loss postmenopausal woman low bone mass , due possible strong effect combination individual treatment . Objective : To test CAM intervention include green tea polyphenol ( GTP ) Tai Chi ( TC ) exercise feasibility , quantitatively assess individual conjugate effect postmenopausal woman osteopenia . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) 24 week GTP supplement , TC exercise , combination benefit bone remodel measure bone biomarkers muscle strength/physical function postmenopausal woman osteopenia compare receiving placebo , ( 2 ) change bone biomarkers associate bone remodeling correlate change oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 24-week , randomize , placebo-controlled intervention trial investigate effect green tea polyphenols ( GTP ) Tai Chi ( TC ) relevant primary secondary endpoint postmenopausal woman osteopenia . Women least 2 year menopause , osteopenia , recruit primarily local senior independent/assisted living facility , municipal senior community center , obstetrics gynecology clinic . After screen , qualified participant match age randomly assign one four treatment group : placebo , GTP , placebo+TC , GTP+TC . During 24-week intervention , participant provide calcium vitamin D daily . The participant placebo group receive medicinal starch 24 week . The GTP participant receive GTP 24 week . The placebo+TC participant receive placebo TC treatments 24 week . The GTP+TC participant receive GTP TC treatments 24 week . Participants receive primary secondary outcome measure baseline , 4 , 12 , 24 week . The primary outcome measure concentration bone biomarkers . The secondary outcome measure biomarker oxidative stress DNA damage . Additional secondary outcome muscle strength/physical function . Investigators evaluate endpoint blind intervention allocation .</detailed_description>
