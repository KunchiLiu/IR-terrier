	<brief_summary>Summary : A picture emerge dendritic cell migrate blood airway follow allergen inhalation atopic asthmatic . Although Koh McCarthy article present novel finding , provide comprehensive view sputum DCs follow allergen challenge . Therefore , propose study examine kinetics mDCs pDCs induce sputum atopic asthmatic follow inhalation allergen . Hypothesis : Following allergen challenge , sputum myeloid plasmacytoid DCs migrate airway lumen atopic asthmatic timeframe late asthmatic response . Objective : The objective study examine kinetics dendritic cell induce sputum follow allergen challenge atopic asthmatic subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects put two study period . Each study period consist four visit separate 2-4 week . On first visit , subject undergo screening procedure , include complete history physical examination . In addition , methacholine inhalation challenge skin-prick testing preform assess airway hyper-responsiveness determine atopic status respectively . Lastly , sputum induced challenge ( 0 hr ) peripheral blood collect . On second visit , subject inhale diluent allergen sputum collect 7 hour follow inhalation challenge . Next , third visit , subject return 24 hour follow inhalation challenge sputum induce . On final visit , subject return 72 hour follow inhalation challenge sputum collect , along peripheral blood . Before next study period begin , washout period 2-4 week . On first visit second study period , methacholine challenge perform ensure return PC20 within one double dose baseline value . Also , sputum induced challenge ( 0hrs ) peripheral blood collect . On second visit , subject inhale diluent allergen sputum collect 7hrs follow inhalation challenge . Next , third visit , subject return 24 hour follow inhalation challenge sputum induce . On final visit , subject return 72 hour follow inhalation challenge sputum collect , along peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
