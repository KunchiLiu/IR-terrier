	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety efficacy GW786034 ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) therapeutic patient afflict differentiated , medullary anaplastic thyroid cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Assessment impact therapy GW786034 serum/plasma vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level . II . To explore potential relationship change thyroglobulin level tumor response patient advance differentiated thyroid cancer know thyroglobulin antibody negative . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month 3 year registration .</detailed_description>
