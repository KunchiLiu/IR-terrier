	<brief_summary>This observational study parents/ guardian child receipt preschool booster approach child ( ren ) take part . Following write informed consent Vaccine Research Nurse explain purpose study would involve . Participation involve completion health diary week follow vaccination document child term local reaction systemic symptom well visit doctor ( GP hospital ) . The nurse telephone family 48−72 hour follow vaccination see child . Information vaccine give current campaign vaccine administer infant schedule include date administration , product batch number record available . Should large local reaction report nurse may visit child take photograph document illustrate - photograph take without child 's face visible . Subjects recruit two centre - Hertfordshire Gloucestershire . Recruitment start soon necessary approval place . Monthly report observe data submit MHRA though formal analysis conduct end study . Recruitment figure incidence ESLs review six−monthly basis . At point difficult predict parental attitude take part , though experience recruitment previous study hop positive , afford large number participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Gather Safety Data Following Administration Hib-containing Booster Vaccine Children Aged Two Five Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medicines , include vaccine , monitor Medicines Healthcare Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) use commonly know `` yellow card system '' patient healthcare professional may submit notification . This involve report untoward medical event suspect may relate administration give medicine . Through system concern raise large local reaction , particularly extensive limb swell ( ESL ) usually define area equal 50mm , young child receipt pre−school booster . The preschool booster vaccine contain diphtheria ( D ) , tetanus ( T ) , pertussis ( P ) inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) . Most child yellow card safety report submit would prim whole cell pertussis ( wP ) contain vaccines infancy . In case report note blister cellulitis vaccinate limb antibiotic treatment prescribe . There recognise risk ESL small proportion child , 2−13 % , follow administration fourth fifth dose acellular−pertussis contain vaccine . In previous study local reaction fully resolve without treatment within day . Acellular pertussis ( aP ) contain vaccine use exclusively routine infant immunisation programme teh UK since September 2004 . The first child receive primary immunisation course exclusively aP contain vaccine reach 3.5 year , age preschool booster give , December 2007 . This fourth dose aP contain vaccine therefore provide opportunity define great precision incidence ESL follow vaccination UK child regard primary immunisation history aP v previously use whole cell pertussis ( wP ) vaccine . These child subject unique vaccination schedule compare previous study mention . They vaccinate accelerated schedule compare country , 2 , 3 4 month , meningococcal conjugate vaccine time primary immunisation . To end ask parents/ guardian individual receipt pre−school booster complete health diary week follow vaccination . Changes routine pre−school booster recently announce . These instituted provide fourth dose Hib vaccine cohort child , virtue birth date , dose . The lack fourth dose Hib vaccine recognise UK Department Health Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation potentially put group child great risk Hib disease . These child birth date 13 March 2003 3 September 2005 young include Hib catch campaign 2004 , include child bear April 1999 October 2002 ( ie 6 month 4 year start campaign ) become 6 month age campaign ( ie bear October 2002 March 2003 ) old receive dose Menitorix since introduction national schedule September 2006 . The objective recently announce programme deliver safe effective booster vaccine logistically simple cost−effective way . To end eligible child give Hib vaccine alongside routine pre−school booster . At pre−school , child vaccinate DTaP inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) . The Hib vaccine deliver form Infanrix−IPV−Hib Pediacel DTaP−Hib−IPV combination . There small percentage child identify already pre−school booster without Hib component , re−called offer dose Menitorix , MenC Hib conjugate vaccine . The vaccine use Hib campaign may give child upper age limit specify Summary Product Characteristics ( SPC ) addition differ antigen content normally give age : - Pediacel contain high dos diphtheria acellular pertussis component Repevax . The diphtheria content previously show affect reactogenicity aP exception swell =3 cms day 2 vaccination swell &gt; =3cm occur 17.5 % DTaP recipient compare 10.0 % DT recipient ( p= 0.02 ) . - Older child receive tetanus conjugate Menitorix month receipt pre−school booster may therefore high tetanus antibody level . This previously show association reactogenicity study tetanus conjugate dose similar include Menitorix vaccine . One main objective UK Vaccine Evaluation Consortium provide data use plan refine national immunisation programme . Though body evidence support safety campaign , nevertheless provide natural opportunity specialist Vaccine Research Nurses interact parent collect safety data follow administration preschool booster .</detailed_description>
