	<brief_title>CT Scans Screening Lung Cancer Current Former Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess feasibility establish lung cancer screen program University Nebraska Medical Center use CT scan normal study participant least 30 pack-year history cigarette smoking . - To determine possible screen 100 high-risk individual high-resolution CT scan presence suspicious pulmonary nodule . - To compare effective definitive work-up study participant abnormal result within defined time period initial screening . OUTLINE : Study participant complete detailed questionnaire ( paper electronic version ) baseline provide personal family information inclusion registry database . Registry data include information participant ' medical history , diet , lifestyle habit , past current environmental exposure , well family history cancer within participant 's extend family tree . An instruction manual completing questionnaire provide study participant . The System Coordinator registry may provide additional information clarification information provide questionnaire via structure telephone interview . Data study participant family enter registry database either manually via paper-based questionnaire electronically via interactive Web-based questionnaire complete participant registry website . Study participant also undergo low-dose spiral CT scan baseline . The resulting image store electronically link web-based participant registry . A radiologist review image , report abnormality , render interpretation scan positive negative lung nodule . The radiologist 's finding convey study participant 's primary care physician follow determination make : participant negative finding ( i.e. , non-calcified solid nodule &lt; 5 mm non-solid nodule &lt; 8 mm ) return home schedule repeat CT scan 1 year ; participant abnormality relate lung cancer refer primary care physician action ; participant positive finding undergo additional diagnostic work-up treatment* describe . - Non-calcified solid nodule ≥ 5 ≤ 15 mm : Study participant undergo course antibiotic follow high-resolution CT scan 3 month . If CT finding stable , participant return repeat CT scan 1 year . If nodule grow , participant undergo additional diagnostic work-up , may include biopsy positive nodule treat clinician . - Non-solid nodule ≥ 8 mm : Study participant undergo treatment antibiotic , CT follow-up , additional diagnostic work-up , appropriate , describe previously . - Non-calcified solid nodule &gt; 15 mm : Study participant undergo work-up positive nodule , . NOTE : *Study participant demonstrate radiographic abnormality suspect inflammatory nature give 10-day course broad spectrum respiratory antibiotic , preferably fluoroquinolone , participate physician enrol participant study . Study participant negative CT finding undergo CT screen yearly five year , absence diagnose malignancy . Diagnostic work-up repeat CT scan follow : - Any new lesion : Study participant undergo work-up previously describe non-calcified solid non-solid nodule . - Any non-calcified nodule present earlier grow size : - Growth &lt; 3 mm : Study participant undergo repeat CT scan 6 month . If growth , participant worked-up positive nodule , , scan stable , participant undergo repeat scan 1 year recent scan . - Growth 3 mm 5 mm : Study participant undergo high-resolution CT scan 3 month diagnostic work-up positive nodule , describe previously , growth . If complete resolution nodule , participant undergo repeat screen CT scan 1 year recent scan . If partial resolution nodule , another high-resolution CT scan perform 3 month later . Participants stable nodule undergo repeat screen CT scan 1 year recent scan . - Growth ≥ 5 mm : Study participant receive course antibiotic undergo high-resolution CT scan 1 month . The following assessment also perform : work-up positive nodule , growth ; repeat screen CT scan 1 year recent scan , complete resolution nodule ; high-resolution CT scan 3 month , partial resolution nodule ; repeat screen CT scan 1 year recent scan , nodule stable . All study participant undergo blood sample collection baseline use future study . Additional blood sample obtain study participant positive CT scan future research smoking-related disease . Tissue sample obtain diagnostic biopsy surgical specimen also store future research . Once malignancy diagnose definitive intervention perform , study participant follow periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
