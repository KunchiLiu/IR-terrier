	<brief_title>Dose Range Finding Study BF2.649 Versus Placebo Treat Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Parkinson 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterize rest tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia loss postural reflex affect 1 % North American population . Besides motor problem also call non-motor problem . Excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) bothersome non-motor problem , affect 20 % 50 % PD patient currently , n't register treatment trouble . The study medication BF2.649 test novel , highly potent , selective , orally active inverse agonist histamine H3 receptor , therefore strengthen histaminergic transmission brain increase wakefulness EDS characterize daytime somnolence sudden sleep episode . This problem several consequence , e.g. , impairment quality life , interference activity daily live handicap management social family affair . The primary endpoint study measure change well-validated Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS ) . The ESS simple self-administered 8-item questionnaire . The outcome get impression level daytime sleepiness several real-life situation . On basis pharmacological clinical rationale consider relevant carry dose-finding study original , non-amphetamine molecule PD patient affect excessive daytime sleepiness . PD severity assess routinely use UPDRS .</detailed_description>
