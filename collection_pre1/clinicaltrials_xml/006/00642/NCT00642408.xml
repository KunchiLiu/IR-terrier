	<brief_summary>Intrauterine Growth Retardation important determinant mortality morbidity neonatal period . It also important factor predict nutritional status , health development childhood . It even influence health adult life , contribute vicious cycle disease poverty . The high rate IUGR DCs represent therefore major public health problem . Maternal malnutrition usually assume major determinant problem country . An increase amount evidence point potential role play micronutrient deficiency pregnancy . The adverse effect birthweight maternal iron deficiency anaemia , lack zinc lack iodine document . A similar effect suspect Vitamin A , Magnesium , Calcium , Copper , Thiamine , Pyridoxine Folic acid . It seem one specific deficiency alone responsible adverse effect , rather combination . Therefore , expect cover need pregnant woman multivitamin-mineral supplement effect public health importance child 's health . This study objective improve child 's health prevent intrauterine growth retardation provision multivitamin-mineral supplement pregnancy . This research include 2 constituent : 1. pilot phase socio-anthropological , nutritional epidemiological aspect IUGR assess qualitative epidemiological method . 2. double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled trial , include 1215 pregnant woman aim test 3 hypothesis : supplement pregnant woman multivitamin-minerals mix improve fetal growth ; improve fetal growth positive effect health growth infancy ; cover nutritional need lactate woman multivitamin-minerals mix 3 month delivery improve health growth infant . The trial plan Hounde District , Burkina Faso , collaboration Centre Muraz , play leader role research service provide district level policy recommendation national level . This ensure study finding incorporate on-going district programme possible replication national level . The research last June 2003 October 2006 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Intrauterine Growth Retardation Hounde District , Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low birthweight ( LBW ; birthweight &lt; 2500g ) important predictor mortality morbidity neonatal period early postnatal growth growth childhood . It also associate cognitive behavioural development first year life , health status childhood , adult health human capital . As much 16 % live birth worldwide present LBW , 90 % low-income countries.Rates particularly high Asia sub-Saharan country . In Burkina Faso , estimate 19 % live birth 1999-2005 LBW . In develop country , case LBW attribute intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) rather preterm delivery.Factors interact fetal development numerous . Among maternal malnutrition , particularly micronutrient deficiency , malaria pregnancy assume major determinant IUGR . Dietary survey consistently show multiple micronutrient deficiency , rather single deficiency , common . It therefore expect provide multiple micronutrient ( MMN ) , instead iron folic acid ( IFA ) currently recommend WHO , could effect public health importance fetal growth correlate . The UNICEF/WHO/UNU multiple micronutrient supplement pregnancy lactate woman ( UNIMMAP ) design expert propose field test . A recent systematic review conclude additional evidence need establish effect maternal MMN supplement infant maternal health . The study describe part series efficacy study effect UNIMMAP supplement pregnancy outcomes . The study take place health district Houndé ( south-west Burkina Faso ) surround 2 health center ( 12,000 inhabitant ) June 2003 October 2006 . Houndé situate Sudano-Sahelian climate belt . The diet essentially cereal-based . In 2004 2006 , food consumption survey estimate average caloric intake pregnancy 8.6 MJ 8.1 MJ postharvest pre-harvest season respectively . Malaria transmission permanent seasonal variation . In 2002 , HIV prevalence among consult pregnant woman district estimate 2 % . The incidence LBW term infant around 17 % District Hospital 2000-2001 . The recruitment participant community-based . During preliminary census , house study area map numbered unique identification code allocate every woman child-bearing age . Twenty-five locally trained home-visitors visit monthly every compound early detection pregnancy referral health center pregnancy test . Once pregnancy confirm extensive explanation study purpose procedure Bwamu , Moré Dioula , participant ask provide sign consent thumbprint . There exclusion criterion plan leave area within next 2 year . This study double-blind , randomize control trial , directly observe drug intake . Pregnant woman randomly assign receive either IFA ( iron 60 mg folic acid 400µg ) MMN ( UNIMMAP : vitamin A 800µg , vitamin E 10 mg , vitamin D 5 µg , vitamin B1 1.4 mg , vitamin B2 1.4 mg , niacin 18 mg , vitamin B6 1.9 mg , vitamin B12 2.6 µg , folic acid 400 µg , vitamin C 70 mg , iron 30 mg , zinc 15 mg , copper 2 mg , selenium 65 µg , iodine 150 µg ) 3 month delivery . Intervention control micronutrient tablet identical appearance manufacture Scanpharm ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) container letter code ( A/B ) intervention group . This code keep secret study participant study personnel data analysis . Micronutrients keep cool room allocation . Vitamin C level , identify labile component MMN , monitor year find remarkably constant trial . Participants also randomly assign receive either malaria weekly chemoprophylaxis ( chloroquine 300 mg ) versus intermittent preventive treatment ( sulphadoxine 1500 mg pyrimethamine 75 mg 2nd 3rd trimester ) . The malaria component analyse separately . In case maternal illness , appropriate treatment provide accord national guideline . Severely anemic woman ( hemoglobin &lt; 70 g/L , without dyspnea ) receive ferrous sulphate ( 200 mg ) + folic acid ( 0.25 mg ) twice daily , 3 month whatever allocation group . All participant also receive Albendazole 400 mg second third trimester . In case malaria episode despite preventative treatment , quinine ( 300 mg , 3 time day ) give 5 day . Vitamin A ( 200.000 IU ) give woman delivery , conformity national recommendation .</detailed_description>
