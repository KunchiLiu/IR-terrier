	<brief_summary>This study apply polysomnography ( PSG ) evaluate effect quetiapine fumarate sleep architecture . Most previous study evaluate sleep self-reported questionnaire antipsychotic treatment ( clozapine , risperidone , olanzapine , et al ) , study PSG evaluation limitation , : small sample size , respective cross-sectional , potential sleep disorder , et al . In study , investigate subjective objective effect quetiapine fumarate improve sleep quality schizophrenic patient PSG well psychiatric scale . The control drug study typical antipsychotic - haloperidol . It could increase sleep duration efficiency mostly increase S2 without effect rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep slow wave sleep ( SWS ) . The patient randomise two group parallel design . This study design rater blind reduce bias evaluation . It suggest sedative effect quetiapine fumarate could diminish 2 week , therefore , use 4 week ensure change sleep quality study , could helpful evaluation relative short middle term effect quetiapine fumarate sleep quality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . The objective sleep structure quetiapine fumarate haloperidol use mono-therapy respectively treatment patient acute schizophrenia measure change composite variable PSG test ( sleep stage , time bed , total sleep time , sleep efficiency , sleep latency ) baseline Week 4 ( LOCF ) . 2 . The subjective sleep quality quetiapine fumarate haloperidol use mono-therapy respectively treatment patient acute schizophrenia measure change Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory ( PSQI ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) baseline Week 4 ( LOCF ) . 3 . The clinical efficacy quetiapine fumarate haloperidol use mono-therapy respectively treatment patient acute schizophrenia measure change Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) Clinical Globe Impression ( CGI ) , Calgary Depression Scale Schizophrenia ( CDSS ) baseline Week 4 ( LOCF ) . 4 . The clinical safety tolerance quetiapine fumarate haloperidol use mono-therapy respectively treatment patient acute schizophrenia measure Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale ( TESS ) day 14 day 28 .</detailed_description>
