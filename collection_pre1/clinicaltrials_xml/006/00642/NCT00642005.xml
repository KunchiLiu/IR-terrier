	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery allow surgeon remove bowel via small incision . To allow insertion camera instrument , cold dry gas blow abdominal cavity . This project investigate use warm , humidify gas laparoscopic surgery . The hypothesis result less damage internal surface , shorten recovery time . Previous study demonstrate positive outcome laparoscopic gallbladder operation . The investigator plan study patient undergo laparoscopic colon operation , operation longer effect humidification magnify . The investigator enroll 74 patient : 37 operation cold dry gas , 37 warm , humidify gas . The investigator measure intraoperative heat loss , postoperative pain , fatigue , nausea vomiting , time return bowel function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The key determinant return normal activity major colorectal surgery pain fatigue . Our research group interest enhance perioperative care reduce postoperative fatigue . We investigate effect peritoneal inflammation local production cytokine fatigue . Our data indicate association development postoperative fatigue concentration peritoneal cytokine follow colorectal surgery . ( Paddison , Hill - manuscript submission ) . It know follow surgery , two possible mode communication cytokine brain . One hormonal routine cytokine produce site surgery enter blood proceed cell surface receptor act directly brain . The second method neural route represent paracrine action cytokine primary afferent neuron innervate body site injury take place . In abdominal cavity , vagus nerve play important role latter form communication . Vagal sensory neuron express large number receptor immune derive mediator , include number cytokine involve inflammation show major function vagus may involve signal immune inflammatory situation . The vagus unique termination nucleus tractus solitarius ( NTS ) brain . The NTS intensely activate follow peripheral immune challenge also far sensitive area brain follow immune stimulation . The NTS project monosynaptically many region brain mediate sickness response . Pro-inflammatory cytokine find blood , skin , central nervous system surgery injury , however follow major abdominal surgery colectomy cytokine find high concentration peritoneal cavity . This local production cytokine far excess amount find serum suggest important local role potentially significant role metabolic change associate colonic surgery . Therefore , inflammation consequent production large concentration cytokine site surgery may activate rich neurosensory vagal afferent stimulate region brain mediate `` sickness '' response . Therefore , feasible hypothesize strategy lead reduction concentration pro-inflammatory cytokine lead reduction post-operative fatigue . In laparoscopic surgery , insufflate CO2 deliver define United States Pharmacopoeia National Formulary , require impurity le 200 part per million , include water vapor . It deliver room temperature ( 21Â°C ) relative humidity approach 0 % . Heat lose body warm humidify cold , dry gas 1 , animal model demonstrate induce hypothermia . Initial human investigation show simply heat insufflate gas , core temperature maintain pain score improve . Additional finding show heat humidification help maintain core temperature porcine model 4 . There clinical evidence suggest heat humidification increase intraoperative core body temperature reduce post-operative use analgesia pain score 14 day postoperatively . This intervention also link significantly early return normal activity patient undergo cholecystectomy . Experimental study also show humidify gas associate less peritoneal systemic inflammation compare unhumidified gas . Furthermore , demonstrate use warm , humidify gas associate reduction concentration peritoneal IL-6 . The magnitude change even large effect see administration anti-inflammatory agent similar setting . Significant reduction inflammatory peritoneal cytokine ( TNF , IL-1 ) also observe patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy warm CO2 insufflation gas . Currently , study examine effect humidification patient undergo laparoscopic colonic surgery . We hypothesize use warm , humidify insufflation gas lead reduction hypothermia concentration peritoneal cytokine , consequently decrease post-operative pain fatigue , early return normal bowel function activity . Our aim design execute double-blinded randomise control trial test hypothesis . Research Design Methods Patients recruit out-patient clinic across three Auckland public hospital . On day operation , use opaque envelope computer generate random number ; patient allocate 2 group . The intervention group receive warm , humidify insufflation gas control group receive standard dry gas . Other intraoperative variable standardize control . The patient , operate surgeon member clinical team blind treatment give . Using data previous study measure post-operative pain follow colonic surgery ; 37 patient require group provide 20 % reduction post-operative hospital opiate use alpha 0.05 power 0.8 . In order achieve require number aim enroll patient undergo laparoscopic colectomy North Shore , Auckland Middlemore Hospitals . Exclusion criterion : Patients 15 year , acute case , stoma formation ( preop intraop decision , decision change open surgery preoperatively ( intraop conversion include intention treat ) , rectal lesion define less 15cm anal verge image and/or sigmoidoscopy / colonoscopy , steroid dependence , inability consent answer SRS question due cognitive impairment language barrier , ASA &gt; = 4 . A reduction postoperative morphine use form primary outcome study . Secondary outcome include postoperative pain , fatigue , intraoperative heat loss postoperative inflammatory response measure plasma peritoneal pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration . Other outcome measure include nausea vomiting , antiemetic use , return bowel function ; reduction variable contribute endpoint earlier return normal activity . Morphine equivalent analgesia usage document PACU , day operation , day 1 , day 2 , day 3 . Visual analog scale measure pain rest obtain preoperatively , 2 , 4 , 8 12 hour , day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 30 , 60 postoperatively . Intraoperative temperature measure 15min interval use naso-pharyngeal probe . A drain place peritoneal cavity conclusion surgery . On morning follow operation , fluid drain well simultaneous sample blood collect , centrifuge store . Antioxidant level measure , cytokine assay carry multiplexed cytometric bead immunoassay use LINCOplex system ( LINCO Research , St Charles , MO , USA ) . Drain fluid assay pro-inflammatory cytokine , IL-1a , TNF-a , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 concentration . Data acquire use Luminex cytofluorimeter analyze use Luminex 100 IS software version 2.3 run 4-parameter curve fit . The SRS score use measure surgical recovery , administer preoperatively also day 1 , 3 , 7 , 30 , 60 . Anti-emetic use well time return normal bowel function ( ability eat drink one complete hospital meal , passages flatus bowel motion absence nausea vomit ) also record . Patients contact discharge ascertain time return normal preoperative function .</detailed_description>
