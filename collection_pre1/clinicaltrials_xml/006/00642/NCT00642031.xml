	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TCN-PM ( Triciribine ) administer approximately one-hour intravenous infusion weekly schedule day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle patient advance hematologic malignancy ; To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Triciribine follow study drug administration . Secondary objective : To observe anti-tumor effect Triciribine , occur</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Triciribine design prevent development certain protein participate abnormal growth cancer cell . Before start treatment study , `` baseline test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . Your complete medical history record . You ask ability perform everyday activity . You blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . You also bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy perform baseline testing . To collect bone marrow aspirate biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Certain patient risk involvement disease central nervous system may require lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) do . A lumbar puncture involve insert needle vertebra back remove small amount spinal fluid . The fluid check diseased cell , use measure level study drug fluid , use measure level substance show study drug handle body . If find eligible study , start receive Triciribine needle vein , 1 hour , Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day study `` cycle . '' On day receive Triciribine , vital sign measure start infusion , 30 minute ( half-way infusion ) , end infusion , 1 hour complete infusion . An ECG do end infusion Day 1 first cycle . The amount Triciribine receive infusion depend enter study . At least 3 participant enrol dose level . Each new group participant receive high dose level group , unless level reach side effect consider intolerable . This help researcher find high tolerable dose Triciribine . During study , researcher check status cancer see respond study drug . You check week , often , depend accord blood cell count . Each check-up include measurement vital sign blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You ask side effect may experience medication take . During Cycle 1 , blood sample ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn measure amount study drug blood different time . This call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . During Cycle 1 , blood sample drawn receive first dose Triciribine , 2 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour Day 1 Triciribine dose . If doctor decides necessary , additional blood sample also draw 120 144 hour ( 5-6 day ) Day 1 dose Triciribine . During Cycle 1 , may also blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure action study drug tumor cell . This call pharmacodynamic study ( defines drug work tumor cell ) . During Cycle 1 , blood sample drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) receive first dose triciribine 2 24 hour Day 1 triciribine dose . Before receive additional cycle , physical exam , include vital sign . Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test , urine collect . You ask ability perform everyday activity . You bone marrow exam ( include aspiration and/or biopsy ) every 28 day , order check response . Certain participant risk involvement disease central nervous system may require repeat lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) perform week . You may move high dose level first cycle therapy , increase dose level consider safe disease stable respond treatment . If , however , experience serious side effect therapy , doctor may decide hold therapy Triciribine side effect go away , may decide stop therapy altogether , side effect intolerable . Depending fast side effect go away , may able re-start Triciribine infusion low dose . You may continue receive Triciribine study limit number cycle receive , long doctor find benefit therapy experience intolerable side effect . On hand , may stop receive study drug take study effective and/or disease get bad , develop another illness interfere ability safely give study drug , unable tolerate study drug . If leave study reason , ask return follow-up visit end therapy ( possibly 30 day last dose Triciribine , receive another type treatment ) . A physical exam perform , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test , visit . If side effect possibly relate treatment , may need follow-up visit . Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) may need drawn routine test time . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Triciribine authorize FDA use research . Up 34 patient take part multicenter study . Up 30 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must relapsed/refractory leukemias standard therapy anticipate result durable remission . Patients poorrisk myelodysplasia ( MDS ) [ i.e . refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB1 RAEB2 ) WHO classification ] chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) also candidate protocol . 2 . CONTINUATION # 1 : Relapsed/refractory leukemia include acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( AML ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) blast crisis . Patients agnogenic myeloid metaplasia ( AMM ) also eligible ; 3 . ECOG performance status 0 3 ; 4 . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment trial . Nursing patient exclude . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . Pregnant nursing patient exclude effect Triciribine fetus nursing child unknown ; 5 . Must able willing give write informed consent ; 6 . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 2 week cytotoxic agent , least 5 halflives noncytotoxic agent . If patient hydroxyurea control peripheral blood leukemic cell count , patient must hydroxyurea least 48hours initiation treatment protocol . Persistent chronic clinically significant toxicity prior chemotherapy must great grade 1 ; 7 . Patients must follow clinical laboratory value , unless abnormal parameter level consider related leukemia : Creatinine ( Cr ) less equal 2.0 mg/dL , Bilirubin Normal limit ( less equal 1.5 * Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) liver metastasis ) unless consider due Gilbert 's syndrome , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 3.0 * ULN , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 3.0 * ULN 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement ; 2 . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure ; 3 . Patients receive standard investigational treatment hematologic malignancy .</criteria>
