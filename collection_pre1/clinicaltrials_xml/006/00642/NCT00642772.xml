	<detailed_description>Background / Rationale : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common chronic condition among veteran , half VA health care user OA report limit daily activity joint symptom . Physical therapy ongoing exercise help reduce pain improve physical function . However , majority veteran OA physically inactive . Furthermore , physical therapy appointment VA health care system limit resource , demand often exceed supply , result long wait period limit number visit ( 1 2 ) per patient . Extending physical therapy service large number veteran OA , cost effective manner , may play key role improve outcome large patient group . Objective : The objective pilot study perform preliminary evaluation group-based physical therapy program veteran knee OA , preparation large grant submission . This pilot work allow u assess feasibility group-based session , refine intervention session component need , assess plan recruitment enrollment method , estimate number potentially eligible veteran Durham VAMC , conduct sample size power analysis large clinical trial . Methods : All participant involve 12-week group-based physical therapy program , study measure obtain baseline immediately follow program completion . Participants Durham VAMC patient symptomatic knee OA . Our goal enroll 20 participant complete program follow-up measure , may recruit 25 participant total , participant drop program completion . Participants attend group physical therapy session bi-weekly twelve week ( total six visit ) , session last approximately one hour . Two study team member , license physical therapist research assistant training exercise knee OA , lead session . The research assistant lead group exercise , physical therapist ass progress monitor potential problem special need individual patient . During first 10-15 minute group session , one study team member talk participant topic relate OA care , joint protection , weight management , joint injection surgery , stress management . The remainder session involve group warm-up / stretching exercise , series strengthening exercise tailor patient knee OA . Participants also instruct perform stretching exercise daily strengthen exercise three time total week . Primary outcome measure self-reported pain function . Statistical analysis compare pre- post-intervention pain function , include effect size calculation assist sample size estimate large study . Impact : This study significant examines novel health service delivery method improve outcome among patient OA - highly prevalent condition also one main cause pain among veteran . Specifically , pilot study key first step toward examine efficacy cost-effectiveness method deliver physical therapy service large number veteran OA . This delivery method could also applied common orthopedic neurologic condition require physical therapy service .</detailed_description>
