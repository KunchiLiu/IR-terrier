	<detailed_description>Only one-fourth one-third fertilize human eggs likely survive produce term baby . The cause reproductive failure substantially unknown , scientific evidence suggest may , part , due exposure pre-conception nutrition , may result insult oocyte periconceptual embryo . Early reproductive event may long-lasting impact several recently identify antecedent adult-onset disease . The goal prospective epidemiologic study evaluate hypothesis increase oxidative stress result delay time-to-pregnancy early pregnancy loss . Recently , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) associate spontaneous abortion , preeclampsia , premature preterm rupture membrane woman defective sperm function men . In live cell ROS form continuously consequence biochemical reaction external factor . In prospective cohort study healthy couple plan pregnancy , evaluate time-to-pregnancy , define number menstrual cycle cessation contraception clinically recognize pregnancy , early unrecognized pregnancy loss . Unrecognized pregnancy subsequent early loss determine measure urinary human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . Diet assess partner prior conception use Block food frequency questionnaire serum assay antioxidant vitamin C E , carotenoid , selenium . Two urinary biomarkers oxidative stress , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine F2a-isoprostanes , serum biomarker antioxidative capacity , oxygen radical absorbance capacity , measure woman . The propose study number strength : 1 ) large prospective design , diet oxidative stress measure prior conception ; 2 ) highly sensitive specific assay hCG use detect conception early time implantation ; 3 ) dietary intake biomarker assay antioxidant status assess twice preconception period use state-of-the-art assessment method include diet calibration substudy ; 4 ) propose research potential fill gap understand role diet achieve successful conception , area little investigation do .</detailed_description>
