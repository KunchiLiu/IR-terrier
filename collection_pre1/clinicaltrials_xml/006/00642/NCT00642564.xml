Up , still limit information relationship frequency seizure attack headache occurrence . Thus , purpose study investigate incidence headache , explore relationship seizure attack headache occurrence , classify headache , document frequency , characteristic , effect migraine headache among patient epilepsy . This study multi-centre survey collect data patient diagnose epilepsy follow epilepsy clinic . Patients participate study sign date inform consent . There two stage study : Stage I : On enrollment , data demographic characteristic , epilepsy profile , seizure frequency , epilepsy treatment would obtain . Body weight height would measure . Information prior headache occurrence relationship seizure would also collect . Stage II : Patients enrol study divide three group : patient seizure free past 6 month , patient &gt; 1 attack every month within past 6 month , patient .
