	<brief_title>Portable Monitoring Diagnosis Management Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomize , parallel group , unblinded , multicenter study compare two approach [ home-based , portable monitoring ( PM ) versus attend , laboratory-based polysomnography ( PSG ) ( Lab ) ] adult , least 18 year age , moderate high probability obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) refer sleep medicine specialist AASM-accredited sleep center evaluation and/or management . The study design compare utility two approach ( PM group v . Lab group ) diagnosis management OSA adult . Approximately 372 eligible adult randomize screen either PM Lab arm ( 186 per arm ) , undergo baseline OSA test confirm diagnosis study eligibility , receive positive airway pressure ( PAP ) titration study determine level pressure need treat OSA . For qualify participant , titration study lab-based Lab group home-based use commercially available portable , automatic PAP device ( APAP ) PM group . All qualify study participant access study CPAP equipment supply treat OSA . Primary outcome ( time diagnosis effective treatment , patient outcome , relative resource utilization ) determine 1 3 month start CPAP treatment . Study participant complete study visit keep CPAP machine end study .</detailed_description>
