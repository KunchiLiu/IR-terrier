	<brief_summary>It common many population baby develop iron deficiency iron deficiency anemia ( , healthy red blood cell due lack iron ) . This due rapid growth infancy combine limited source iron infant diet . The amount iron baby receive across placenta pregnancy another important factor . This study focus infant bear less usual amount iron body . The purpose study assess effect low iron birth infant behavior development determine provide iron supplement infant begin 6 week foster healthier development . Another part study determine effect iron deficiency anemia different time infant development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Behavior Depending Timing Iron Deficiency Human Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project focus brain-behavior effect depend time iron deficiency ( ID ) iron repletion human infant . Iron deficiency ( ID ) world 's common single nutrient disorder , differentially affect pregnant woman infant everywhere . The study promise first systematic investigation brain behavior effect prenatal dietary iron deficiency human infant . The design support comparison brain/behavior effect depend time duration ID . The study assess reversibility effect , depend time ID treatment , examine maternal vs. fetal iron regulatory mechanism placenta white blood cell . State-of-the-art neurophysiologic behavioral measure test specific hypothesis regard effect ID sensory , motor , cognitive , affective-social regulatory function relate impaired myelination sensory/motor system alter structure , neurotransmitter function neurometabolism target brain region ( basal ganglia hippocampus ) . The study conduct China , rapidly develop country ID often occur among pregnant woman infant absence generalize undernutrition . Cord blood hemoglobin ( Hb ) ferritin concentration measure 1300 rural full-term infant , iron status determine 9 18 mo . Brain-behavior assessment perinatal period involve 359 infant ( `` newborn cohort '' ) : 59 low Hb ( `` low birth iron '' group ) receive iron ; 200 marginal Hb low cord ferritin ( `` marginal birth iron '' group ) randomly assign 6 wk , 50 iron therapy 150 vitamin ; 100 normal cord Hb ferritin level ( `` normal birth iron '' group ) receive vitamin . The remain 763 infant cord blood test form `` blood screen cohort . '' At 9 18 mo , newborn cohort reassess , along IDA infant blood screen cohort - 58 9 mo ( `` early postnatal IDA '' ) 48 18 mo ( `` late postnatal IDA '' ) . Approximately 39 marginal-birth-iron vitamin only-treated infant newborn cohort may also IDA 9 mo ( `` combine ID '' ) . IDA infant treat vitamin iron . Differential effect and/or reversibility depend time ID treatment could inform health policy practice worldwide . However , effect prenatal iron deficiency receive little study human infant due large part previous thinking , longer accept , infant protect . Up 75 % pregnant woman worldwide anemic , half due ID . An estimated 20-25 % 6- 24-mo-old infant IDA , ID without anemia . Thus , public health implication study finding could profound . The project expect continue 5-year follow-up ( Aug 2013-July 2017 ) .</detailed_description>
