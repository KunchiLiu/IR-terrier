	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrolment study must meet following criterion : Male adult female adult nonchildbearing potential 40 75 year age ( inclusive ) . Note : female eligible enter participate study nonchildbearing potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant ) . This include female postmenopausal . For purpose study , post menopausal define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom . Postmenopausal status may confirm serum FSH oestradiol concentration screen deem necessary PI . Surgical sterility define female hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis : establish clinical history COPD accordance follow description American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [ American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society , 2004 ] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease preventable treatable disease characterise airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . Subjects cigarette smoke history ≥10 pack year ( 1 pack year = 20 cigarette smoke per day 1 year equivalent ) . Both current former smoker eligible enrol . A former smoker define subject smoked ≥6 month Visit 1 . Subjects postbronchodilator FEV1 FVC ratio ( FEV1 : FVC ) &lt; 0.7 Visit 1 .
