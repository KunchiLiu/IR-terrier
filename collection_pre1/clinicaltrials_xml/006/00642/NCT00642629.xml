	<brief_summary>It fully clear rheumatoid arthritis originate develops , understood multiple genetic environmental factor interact trigger onset . The immune system attack joint synovium , damage cartilage bone joint increase number inflammatory cell form new blood vessel joint space . STA-5326 mesylate inhibits production IL-12 IL-23 therefore may inhibit Th-1 cytokine production . A reduction Th-1 response potential minimize eliminate joint damage cause immune response rheumatoid arthritis . This study design ass whether propose mechanism action associate reduction inflammation synovium patient rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
