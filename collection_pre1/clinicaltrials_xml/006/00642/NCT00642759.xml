	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn whether combination drug carboplatin , Abraxane Avastin help treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . One standard treatment advance NSCLC combination drug carboplatin , paclitaxel Avastin . Paclitaxel associate severe side effect may make treatment difficult tolerate . Some side effect cause solution use dissolve paclitaxel administer . Abraxane different form paclitaxel need dissolve solution . Abraxane approve treatment breast cancer approve treat NSCLC . We also try learn drug Avastin may work treat cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Abraxane , Bevacizumab Previously Untreated Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive single dose Avastin 2 week schedule start combination carboplatin , Abraxane Avastin . Before dose Avastin give , perfusion CT scan blood work perform . The perfusion CT scan blood draw repeat 12 day teh Avastin dose ( 2 day begin study treatment ) . - The combination carboplatin , Abraxane Avastin give 3 week cycle drug give infusion . On day 1 , Avastin , Abraxane carboplatin wil give . On Day 8 15 , Abraxane give . Participants receive 6 cycle carboplatin , Abraxane Avastin disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . - The following assessment procedure perform day 1 cycle : physical exam ; routine urine test ( every cycle ) ; Performance status assessment . Routine blood test perform day 1 , 8 15 . - Additional procedure perform cycle 2 4 6 month begin study treatment follow : CT scan , PET scan , perfusion CT blood work . - After 6 cycle carboplatin , Abraxane Avastin , participant receive Avastin alone three week . Participants continue receive Avastin long experience unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
