	<detailed_description>1 . Abstract The feasibility , toxicity efficacy Partial Brest Irradiation ( PBI ) currently study major cooperative group NSABP , RTOG well several major academic institution . PBI entail definitive radiation lumpectomy site minimize radiation remain breast tissue . The success PBI dependent small part proper target localization . In radiation therapy , treat internal structure , external landmark must use calculate position internal target . These external landmark easily change non-rigid structure ( e.g . breast ) , would nullify use reference . To address problem , recent advance application ultrasound ( US ) technology target localization especially respect prostate . Transcutaneous track US emerge suitable non-invasive daily prostate localization tool . In procedure US probe track spatially registered respect treatment machine , linear accelerator . Thus one localize target anatomy US image , position target automatically know respect linear accelerator , accelerator correctly aim . Unfortunately , contemporary US image sufficiently sensitive delineate lumpectomy bed PBI . We propose supplant B-mode imaging novel US elasticity imaging ( USEI ) method delineate subtle complex boundary lumpectomy cavity . Our preliminary study suggest USEI may superior B-mode imaging ( see statistical section Ref . 6-7 ) . However work do ex-vivo tissue model . In literature , many study show superior sensitivity specificity strain image compare regular B-mode imaging7 . The benefit develop way use ultrasound target localization clear . Identification target would longer dependent unreliable external landmark direct internal information . As consequence , target error , commonly associate patient positioning , could significantly reduce practically eliminate . Thus , propose study ability USEI detect characterize lumpectomy bed in-vivo use CT data ground truth . We pursue work two specific aim : Aim 1 : Describe concordance lumpectomy bed 's center-of-mass ( COM ) determine USEI CT . Aim 2 : Describe concordance lumpectomy bed volume measure USEI CT .</detailed_description>
