Insertion needle skin ( 60 second Jet ) 4 . Post-needle insertion ( 1 minute completion insertion ) Secondary outcomes measure assess satisfaction . All patient parent ask `` Based IV start today , would like numb medicine future ? '' ( 8 ) The provider report satisfaction relate cooperation `` difficulty find vein '' use 5-point likert scale . The patient 's demographic data , location placement , diagnosis , number attempt include study documentation . All data collection sheet file locked collection cabinet , review principal investigator completion . Study number age identify data collection document .
