	<brief_summary>Breast conserving therapy , ( BCT ) , consist wide local excision tumor follow 6 week whole breast irradiation , ( WBI ) , integral management breast cancer . Evidence suggest WBI may necessary treatment involve area , partial breast irradiation , ( PBI ) , may suffice . PBI achieve interstitial intracavitary brachytherapy , intra-op , post op external beam radiation therapy . The feasibility , toxicity efficacy PBI currently study U.S. Europe . Review small study suggest PBI prove comparable WBI . Chemotherapy combine radiation show increase local control BCT compare radiation alone . However little data sequence timing therapy respect one another affect outcome . As result consensus optimal combination . There real potential benefit concurrent chemo-radiation therapy . Concurrent therapy 1 ) allow treatment start close surgery , theoretically maximize benefit modality ; 2 ) shorten overall treatment program ; 3 ) may also improve local control via chemo-sensitization residual cancer cell . However , concurrent chemotherapy WBI associate prohibitive skin toxicity . Since less breast tissue treat PBI , skin toxicity may longer prohibitive . We show J0381 PBI concurrent dose dense AC safe . As follow-up , propose phase I/II trial address toxicity efficacy associate PBI deliver concurrently various chemotherapy regimen .</brief_summary>
