	<brief_title>Study New Catheter &amp; Pressure Monitor System Help Prevent Compartment Syndrome From Developing Injured Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compartment Syndrome ( CS ) may occur patient fracture crush injury extremity . The current standard-of-care patient risk develop CS clinical watching sign symptom CS , need , measure pressure within muscle compartment ( intramuscular pressure , IMP ) . Currently , IMP measurement make place percutaneous pressure sensor target muscle compartment , attached pressure monitor . Whenever clinical exam and/or pressure measurement suggest CS developing , fasciotomy generally perform immediately . Twin Star Medical develop novel Compartment Monitoring System ( CMS ) consist pressure monitor module two type catheter . Both Twin Star Catheters remove interstitial tissue fluid , may contribute reduction compartment pressure , may use clinical analysis determine certain analyte indicator muscle injury ( biomarkers ) predictive CS development . One type catheter Pressure Measurement/Fluid Collection , ( PMFC ) , remove fluid monitor pressure via solid-state fiber optic transducer tip catheter . The type catheter , Fluid Collection ( FC ) , remove fluid pressure transducer tip . The monitoring module sens , display record pressure measure PMFC catheter well provide vacuum source , require operation fluid removal catheter . The Twin Star CMS Monitoring Module successfully test ( 1 ) ensure delivery specified functional performance requirement need reliably operate Twin Star Catheter , ( 2 ) meet current electrical safety standard establish clinical use . The first model Twin Star catheter monitor review approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) indication pressure measurement withdrawal interstitial fluid . The device use clinical study represent newly design catheter monitor FDA approve therefore consider investigational . It anticipate second-generation model catheter monitor submit FDA approval study conduct . The purpose Study determine removal interstitial fluid Twin Star Catheter low muscle compartment pressure impact measure subject clinical status , include possible reduction need fasciotomy . The Study population Subjects suffer isolated tibial fracture ( open close ) require surgical stabilization within 72 hour injury . This Study use Adaptive study design total 90 subject enrol . All Subjects receive Twin Star catheter , inserted end surgical procedure stabilize tibia fracture connect pressure monitor leave surgical room . The catheter use first 24-hours surgical fixation affect low leg order ( 1 ) measure record muscle compartment pressure , ( 2 ) remove accumulate interstitial fluid subset subject randomize Treatment Group . The first 20 Subjects ( Phase 1 ) randomize ; actively treat different combination catheter vacuum level . The purpose Phase I study optimize treatment parameter use remain 70 subject , constitute Phase II . All subject receive total 3 catheter place anterior compartment . Subjects Phase 1 enrol two group : 1 ) receive constant vacuum ( -150 mmHg ) fluid removal , 2 ) receive intermittent vacuum ( -50 mmHg ) fluid removal . Within anterior compartment , one PMFC 2 FC catheter insert . The first 10 subject Phase 1 treat single-fiber catheter , one two different vacuum level ( intermittent -50 mmHg constant -150 mmHg ) . After first 10 subject complete study , fluid removal result analyze . If result demonstrate fluid anterior compartment withdrawn rate â‰¥ 0.5 mls/24 hour , second group 10 subject continue use single fiber catheter . If result first 10 subject demonstrate fluid withdrawn anterior compartment &lt; 0.5 mls/24 hour , next 10 subject instead receive treatment two multi-fiber FC catheter plus PMFC catheter . After first 20 subject enrol study , remain subject enrol Phase 2 randomize either Treatment Control group . Both group receive treatment whichever combination catheter type ( single multi-fiber ) vacuum ( constant intermittent ) efficacious term fluid removal Phase 1 . The randomization determine whether subject receive vacuum ( Control Group : Monitoring alone ) fluid removal mode show best first phase study ( Treatment Group : Monitoring plus Fluid Removal ) . The rationale adaptive study design develop second-generation catheter whose fluid removal function optimize vivo human . Although first generation catheter use multi-fibers , animal study result demonstrate single-fiber catheter remove amount fluid vivo multi-fiber catheter , make much small multi-fiber catheter . The Subject 's length initial hospital stay determine attend physician base subject 's medical condition ( ) . The standard-of-care routine clinical compartment pressure monitor apply vacuum non-vacuum group Study catheter leave place 24 hour . Compartment syndrome dignosis depend clinical assessment supplement pressure measurement . Throughout study , treat physician monitor subject accord standard clinical practice apply standard clinical judgment regard diagnosis compartment syndrome . Treating physician may end study perform fasciotomy feel necessary clinical suspicion compartment syndrome developing . A two-week 3-month follow-up visit require post discharge , coincide typical clinical follow-up visit . The purpose two-week visit primarily ass whether adverse consequence relate catheter . The purpose three-month assessment primarily look evidence sequela miss untreated compartment syndrome , claw toe persistent neurologic dysfunction . Functional outcome measure follow-up visit well occurrence adverse event since discharge . Functional outcome include assessment whether loss motor function result part primary injury .</detailed_description>
