	<brief_summary>Leg pain cause peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) severely impede walk ability . Our preliminary finding indicate drug ramipril much effective improve walk ability current therapy . To accept new treatment PAD finding require validation much large clinical trial.We propose examine effect ramipril therapy 6 month randomize , control trial patient PAD . If positive , study identify ramipril potential new therapy PAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal extend novel find angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , ramipril markedly improve walk ability patient peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , conduct large clinical trial include broad cross-section PAD patient . Hypothesis : That ramipril therapy 24 week result clinically significant increase pain-free maximum walking time improve quality life patient PAD . Background Synopsis : Peripheral arterial disease common disorder , 12 % adult 50 ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) diagnostic PAD ( &lt; 0.9 ) . Approximately one third patient experience intermittent claudication walking , limit ability old individual participate normal activity . The aim PAD treatment improve walk distance quality life intermittent claudication , decrease long term cardiovascular morbidity mortality . However , range medical treatment improve walk distance patient limit . Our pilot study demonstrate treatment PAD patient , infra-inguinal disease without diabetes ramipril 24 week , markedly improve wake ability . Relative placebo , ramipril increase mean treadmill-assessed pain-free waking time 227s ( 160 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) mean maximum walking time 451s ( 240 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Assuming constant speed 0.89 m/s ( 3.2 km/hr ) , correspond clinically significant increase walk distance 401m ( 95 % CI 330m 480m ) would impact appreciably daily functional capacity . The magnitude effect significantly great report conventional medical therapy provide worthwhile clinical benefit . Research Plan Synopsis : The dramatic finding pilot study clearly warrant verification large clinical trial include diabetic patient aorto-iliac disease well infra-inguinal disease . The current proposal expand pilot study large trial broad inclusion criterion . We propose include patient diabetes mellitus currently medicate ACE inhibitor . 264 PAD patient randomise either ramipril ( 10mg daily ) match placebo 24 week randomise , double-blind placebo control trial . All patient undergo treadmill exercise test determine pain free maximum walk time , ABI measurement Duplex scan determine stenosis severity , baseline follow 6 month ramipril therapy . Functional capacity daily life setting , assess use standardise questionnaire ( Walking Impairment Questionnaire Quality Life Questionnaire ) . Outcomes Significance : If positive trial validate pilot finding ACE inhibitor ramipril efficacious new therapy treatment patient claudication result PAD . Given escalate prevalence PAD , work potential widespread impact .</detailed_description>
