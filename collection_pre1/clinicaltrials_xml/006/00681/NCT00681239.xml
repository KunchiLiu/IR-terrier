	<brief_summary>The modified Atkins diet ( MAD ) relatively new , alternative dietary therapy intractable childhood adult epilepsy . Recent evidence suggest strict , highly ketotic , first month may advantageous immediate long-term efficacy . KetoCal® pre-mixed powder use create 4:1 ketogenic diet shake meal substitute .

	<detailed_description>The modified Atkins diet ( MAD ) treatment intractable epilepsy use 100 child adult worldwide since 2002 . It mimic ketotic state ketogenic diet ( KD ) , yet without fluid , calorie , protein restriction , without need inpatient admission fast period . Children start daily allotment 10 gram carbohydrate per day , gradual increase 20-30 gram per day several month . To date , six study demonstrate MAD effective , approximately 50 % patient least 50 % reduction seizure frequency . The MAD work relatively quickly , beneficial result present , within 2-4 week . Over past 5 year since introduction , center others research method make MAD tolerable efficacious . Important clue come 2007 , initial carbohydrate limit 10 gram per day compare 20 gram per day randomize , prospective , crossover design . Although hypothesis two carbohydrate limit equivalent , true 3-month crossover period . At diet onset , significantly high likelihood &gt; 50 % seizure reduction stricter , 10 grams/day MAD use ( 60 % vs. 10 % , p=0.03 ) . Ketosis high group 1 month well , similar previous finding 1-month ketosis level correlate efficacy . These result suggest strict , higher ketotic , start MAD important - although loosen restriction 1-3 month also reasonable adversely affect seizure control . That year , research study South Korea evaluate initial ratio ( 3:1 vs. 4:1 ) traditional ketogenic diet similar randomize , crossover design find identical result . A 4:1 initial ketogenic diet ratio correlate high likelihood seizure freedom ( 55 % vs. 31 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) , although ketosis 3 month different . After 3 month , reduce 3:1 lead reduce seizure control child . Recent result use KD center Chicago Memorial also confirm initial month KD may crucial . In study 99 child traditional KD , nearly 90 % child respond KD within first 28 day . This study suggest early KD titration improve efficacy important . The result data within past year confirm first month either MAD KD may critical . In addition , suggestion high ketone level 1 month correlate well seizure reduction . Therefore , strict , highly ketotic initial month dietary therapy may result good seizure reduction . Realizing loosen restriction automatically occur one month , `` tough month '' approach likely follow compliant manner parent know time-limited . What best way achieve high ketosis level initially ? One option fast child start MAD . However , approach raise concern regard hypoglycemia acidosis , especially set outpatient approach , typically use start MAD . Some family specifically ask MAD avoid admission fast period . Another option would give KD first , switch MAD one month . However , significant time financial burden involve KD admission training would decrease interest MAD approach family contact center , truly test MAD effectiveness primary therapy . Other potential way increase ketosis include carnitine supplementation , MCT oil inclusion , calorie restriction . All option , however , financial safety implication . Our proposal , therefore , use 4:1 KetoCal® , proven ability induce high level ketosis , partial supplement MAD . Our concept use supplement first month boost ketosis improve seizure control , data suggests may key important time period . After study complete , would acceptable family use KetoCal® periodic supplement help meal creation , wish . **The study involve 3 trip Baltimore ( travel cover ) 2 month ( baseline , 1 month 2 month ) . Labs cover . The clinic visit , print information , carb-counting book , case KetoCal powder/formula , Ketostix free .</detailed_description>
