Penetration mastoid air cell partial mastoidectomy permit record . A patch autologous fascia pericranium suturable collagenbased dura substitute cut size suture dura defect . The hem native dura expose along craniotomy edge wide enough facilitate suture allow sufficient surface area adherence investigational product . Preoperative Female subject breastfeed , pregnant , intend become pregnant clinical study period Subjects dura lesion recent surgery still potential cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leakage unless expect lesion excise completely , include old suture hole Chemotherapy schedule within 7 day follow surgery Radiation therapy head schedule within 7 day follow surgery Subjects severely alter renal ( serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL ) and/or hepatic function [ ALT , AST &gt; 5 x upper limit norm ( ULN ) ] Evidence infection indicate one following : fever &gt; 101°F , white blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3500/μL &gt; 13000/μL , positive blood culture , positive chest Xray . A positive urine culture ( &gt; 10^5 colonyforming unit ( CFU ) /mL ) lead exclusion unless acute cystitis sole cause . Evidence infection along plan surgical path . A WBC count &lt; 20000/μL permitted patient treat steroid absence infection parameter . Conditions compromise immune system ; existence autoimmune disease Known hypersensitivity aprotinin component investigational product Noncompliant insufficient treatment diabetes mellitus [ glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 7.5 % ] Hydrocephalus , except occlusive hydrocephalus cause posterior fossa pathology treat Existing CSF ( ventricular , etc . ) drain . Burr hole permit long dura remain intact . Cushing cannulation excludes subject . Female subject childbearing potential positive urine serum pregnancy test within 24 hour prior surgery Participation another clinical trial exposure another investigational drug device within 30 day prior enrollment Scheduled foreseeable surgery within followup period Intraoperative Dura injury craniotomy / craniectomy eliminate recreate sufficiently wide native dura hem Failure administer preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis Use implant make synthetic material come direct contact dura ( e.g. , polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) patch , shunt , ventricular subdural drain ) Placement Gliadel wafer Chiari 1 subject without injury arachnoid Persistent sign increase brain turgor Use product ( ) FS VH S/D 500 sapr seal dura suture , include pack Gelfoam Brain surface visible suture loop manifestation increase suture tension CSF leakage complete dura suture present drip drop , grow bead run trickle .
