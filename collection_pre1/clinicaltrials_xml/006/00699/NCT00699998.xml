	<brief_summary>This study evaluate relative efficacy safety prasugrel clopidogrel medically manage Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( UA/NSTEMI ) acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) population ( , patient manage acute coronary revascularization ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Prasugrel Clopidogrel Acute Coronary Syndrome Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based upon significant number subject UA/NSTEMI ACS manage medically high risk future cardiovascular event , exploration novel treatment strategy population , under-represented large clinical trial , warrant . Potential subject recent UA/NSTEMI event medically manage . Eligibility study determine time medical management decision prior commercial clopidogrel treatment time randomization . The TaRgeted platelet Inhibition cLarify Optimal strateGy medicallY manage Acute Coronary Syndromes ( TRILOGY ACS ) Study assess efficacy safety prasugrel aspirin compare current standard care , clopidogrel aspirin , long-term treatment medically manage UA/NSTEMI ACS subject .</detailed_description>
