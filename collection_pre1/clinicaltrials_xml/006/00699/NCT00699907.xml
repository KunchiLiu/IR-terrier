	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood tissue laboratory patient high risk develop ovarian cancer may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor learn effect flutamide biomarkers . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study effect flutamide biomarkers blood tissue sample patient high risk ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Flutamide Biomarkers Blood Tissue Samples From Patients High Risk Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify biomarkers flutamide action ovarian epithelial cell 6 week treatment flutamide patient high risk ovarian cancer . - Examine effect flutamide patient . - Compare result pilot study patient high risk ovarian cancer undergo prophylactic oophorectomy interested take flutamide v patient high risk ovarian cancer undergo prophylactic oophorectomy interested take flutamide ( control ) v patient undergo oophorectomy medical indication ( control ) . OUTLINE : Patients elect receive flutamide undergo prophylactic oophorectomy oophorectomy medical indication . Patients elect receive flutamide randomize 125mg/day . Interested patient elect receive flutamide receive oral flutamide daily 6 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo prophylactic oophorectomy . All patient undergo blood ovarian tissue sample collection time surgery biomarker laboratory study . Proteomic , microarray , polymorphism analysis perform blood tissue sample .</detailed_description>
