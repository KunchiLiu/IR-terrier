	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Each subject must meet follow criterion enrol study : 1 . Provide write informed consent sign subject legal guardian prior enter study undergo study procedure ( If write informed consent provide legal guardian subject unable , write verbal assent subject must also obtain ) . 2 . Be consider reliable willing available study period able record seizures report Adverse Events ( AEs ) self caregiver record seizures report AEs . 3 . Male female great equal 12 year age ( within course study ) . 4 . Females either nonchildbearing potential ( define undergone surgical sterilization , postmenopausal [ age 50 amenorrheic 12 month ] ) childbearing potential . Females childbearing potential must negative serum Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( ßhCG ) Visit 1 negative urine pregnancy test prior randomization Visit 2 . Female subject childbearing potential must agree abstinent use least 1 medically acceptable method contraception ( eg , doublebarrier method [ eg , condom + spermicide , condom + diaphragm spermicide ] , IUD , vasectomise partner ) start Visit 1 throughout entire study period 2 month last dose study drug . Those woman use hormonal contraceptive must also use additional approve method contraception ( describe previously ) start Visit 1 continue throughout entire study period 2 month last dose study drug . ( It require male subject use contraceptive measure base preclinical toxicology data ) . 5 . Have diagnosis epilepsy partial seizure without secondarily generalize seizures accord International League Against Epilepsy 's Classification Epileptic Seizures ( 1981 ) . Diagnosis establish clinical history electroencephalogram ( EEG ) consistent localizationrelated epilepsy ; normal interictal EEGs allow provide subject meet diagnosis criterion ( ie , clinical history ) . 6 . Have compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) within last 10 year rule progressive cause epilepsy . 7 . Have uncontrolled partial seizure despite treat least 2 different antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) within approximately last 2 year . 8 . During 6week Prerandomization Phase subject must ≥5 partial seizure per 6week ( ≥2 partial seizure per 3week period ) 25day seizurefree period 6week period , document via valid seizure diary . Only simple partial seizure motor sign , complex partial seizure , complex partial seizure secondary generalization count toward inclusion . 9 . Are currently treat stable dos 1 , 2 maximum 3 approve AEDs . Only 1 inducer AED ( define ; carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone ) maximum 3 AEDs allow . 10 . Are stable dose concomitant AED ( ) 1 month ( le 21 day ) prior Visit 1 ; case new AED regime initiate subject , dose must stable 2 month ( less 49 day ) prior Visit 1 . 11 . If stable dose ( intermittent rescue use ) benzodiazepine epilepsy ( anxiety sleep disorder ) prescribe dose must stable 1 month ( le 21 day ) prior Visit 1 . ( Note : use intermittent rescue benzodiazepine define exclusion criterion # 22 . ) When use case ( epilepsy , anxiety sleep disorder ) , benzodiazepine count 1 AED ; therefore , 1 maximum 2 additional approve AEDs allow . 12 . A vagal nerve stimulator ( VNS ) allow must implant ≥5 month prior Visit 1 . Stimulator parameter change 1 month ( le 21 day ) prior Visit 1 thereafter study . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Participated study involve administration investigational compound device within 1 month ( le 21 day ) prior Visit 1 , within approximately 5 halflives previous investigational compound , whichever longer . 2 . Pregnant and/or lactating . 3 . Participated previous perampanel study . 4 . Presence nonmotor simple partial seizure . 5 . Presence primary generalize epilepsy seizure , absence myoclonic epilepsy . 6 . Presence previous history LennoxGastaut syndrome . 7 . A history status epilepticus within approximately 12 month prior Visit 1 . 8 . Seizure cluster individual seizure count . 9 . A history psychogenic seizure . 10 . Evidence clinically significant disease ( eg , cardiac , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal disease ) opinion Investigator ( ) could affect subject 's safety study conduct . 11 . Scheduled and/or confirm epilepsy surgery within 6 month Visit 1 ; however previously document `` failed '' epilepsy surgery allow . 12 . Evidence significant active hepatic disease . Stable elevation liver enzyme , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) due concomitant medication ( ) allow less 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 13 . Evidence significant active hematological disease ; white blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; = 2500/µL ( 2.50 1E+09/L ) absolute neutrophil count &lt; = 1000/µL ( 1.00 1E+09/L ) . 14 . A clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , include prolonged QTc define &gt; 450 msec . 15 . Suffering psychotic disorder ( ) and/or unstable recurrent affective disorder ( ) evident use antipsychotic suicide attempt ( ) within approximately last 2 year . 16 . Presence progressive central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , include degenerative CNS disease progressive tumor . 17 . History drug alcohol dependency abuse within approximately last 2 year . 18 . Have multiple drug allergy severe drug reaction AED ( ) , include dermatological ( eg , StevensJohnson syndrome ) , hematological , organ toxicity reaction . 19 . If felbamate use concomitant AED , subject must felbamate least 2 year , stable dose 2 month ( less 49 day ) prior Visit 1 . They must history white blood cell ( WBC ) count 2500/µL ( 2.50 1E+09/L ) , platelets 100,000 , liver function test ( LFTs ) 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , indication hepatic bone marrow dysfunction receive felbamate . If subject receive felbamate past , must discontinue 2 month ( less 49 day ) prior Visit 1 . 20 . Concomitant use vigabatrin . Subjects take vigabatrin past must vigabatrin approximately 5 month prior Visit 1 must documentation show evidence vigabatrin associate clinically significant abnormality visual perimetry test . 21 . Concomitant use barbiturate ( except seizure control indication ) within 1 month ( le 21 day ) prior Visit 1 . 22 . Use intermittent rescue benzodiazepine ( ie , 12 dos 24hr period consider onetime rescue ) 2 time 1month period prior Visit 1 ; 23 . Any condition ( ) make subject , opinion Investigator , unsuitable study .</criteria>
