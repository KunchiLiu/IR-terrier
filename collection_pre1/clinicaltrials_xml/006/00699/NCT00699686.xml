	<brief_summary>Endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) level represent surrogate marker cardiovascular risk indicator ongoing vascular damage . Moreover , EPCs involve pathogenesis virtually diabetic complication . Therefore , way modulate EPCs currently consider utmost importance , especially high-risk subject . While many drug pleiotropic vasculoprotective effect show ability positively modulate EPCs , data effect specific insulin formulation . This human randomise cross-over comparison trial . The purpose compare effect two basal insulin analogue ( detemir glargine ) add oral antidiabetic therapy poorly-controlled type 2 patient cardiovascular disease endothelial function EPC level . The aim test whether optimized glycemic control add-on basal insulin analogues improve endothelial damage regeneration type 2 diabetes macroangiopathy compare effect glargine vs detemir marker endothelial damage regeneration . EPC level innovative outcome measure study represent primary endpoint . Endothelial dysfunction/damage , evaluate use soluble marker , secondary outcome . Given suppose inverse correlation EPC endothelial damage , expect EPC increase reflect amelioration endothelial biology , result may significant clinical implication cohort high-risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus associate strikingly high incidence cardiovascular event . This likely attributable widespread vascular damage due uncontrolled hyperglycaemia associate risk factor . Endothelial dysfunction universally recognise first step natural history atherosclerosis . Therefore , effort deserve understanding pathogenesis new strategy prevent limit development . High glucose concentration one detrimental factor negatively affect endothelial cell function . Through classical damage pathway ( include oxidative stress , PKC MAP kinase activation AGE accumulation ) , hyperglycaemia hamper homeostasis vascular endothelial layer . Besides favour endothelial cell damage , hyperglycaemia also prevent endothelial regeneration negatively modulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) [ 1 ] . EPCs bone marrow-derived cell capable differentiating mature endothelial cell repopulating damage endothelial layer , thus contribute maintain endothelial homeostasis [ 2 ] . Consistently , EPC level directly correlate measure endothelial function [ 3 ] . The pool circulate EPCs reduce presence cardiovascular risk factor , EPC level consider biomarker vascular health , negatively associate measure cardiovascular risk extent vascular damage [ 4 ] . Most importantly , EPC depletion predict cardiovascular event independently risk factor relevant hard measure , leave ventricular function [ 5 ] . In fact , number clinical experimental study indicate alteration EPCs contribute pathogenesis cardiovascular disease virtually diabetic complication [ 6 ] . In light , way expand EPC pool actively pursue : instance , modulation EPCs study demonstrate pleiotropic effect vasculoprotective drug , statin , glitazones ACE inhibitor ( review [ 7 ] . Diabetes associate profound depletion circulate EPCs , related metabolic control ( HbA1c fast glucose ) , adiposity concomitant risk factor [ 8 , 9 ] . Short long-term glycaemic control probably one important determinant EPC pool diabetes . Actually , advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs ) show exert detrimental effect EPCs vitro [ 10 ] . We also demonstrate number function EPCs provide valuable marker vascular damage healthy subject type 2 diabetic patient [ 11 , 12 ] . Interestingly , mild EPC depletion also present pre-diabetic state [ 13 ] , observation strengthens link glucose metabolism EPC biology . Correction hyperglycaemia insulin potential restore circulate EPC pool , likely mobilisation bone marrow . In fact , show experimental hyperglycaemia ( streptozotocin-induced diabetes ) impair ischemia-induced EPC mobilisation , correct basal insulin therapy [ 13 ] . The favourable effect antidiabetic therapy intensification substantiate short-term study human [ 14 ] , mechanism responsible effect incompletely understood . One putative mechanism stimulation nitric oxide production inside bone marrow microenvironment . This compliance one recent observation insulin indeed stimulate production NO [ 15 ] . In bone marrow , follow activation MMP9 , cleavage membrane-bound c-kit ligand , , turn , weaken cell-matrix interaction trigger EPC mobilisation [ 16 ] . It currently unknown whether phenomenon mediate insulin per se reduction plasma glucose , whether exist difference among insulin formulation . Likely , act central EPC compartment ( bone marrow ) , insulin need reach marrow microenvironment sufficiently high concentration , goal could achieve preferentially specific insulin analogue , insulin detemir . It suggest weight gain , follow initiation insulin therapy , may exert negative effect major cardiovascular outcome . Related notion , EPC pool reflect global cardiometabolic profile , also negatively related visceral adiposity [ 4 ] . In mouse model obesity diabetes , generation function EPC profoundly alter [ 17 ] , suggest leptin adipokines may mediate effect [ 18 ] . Hence , net modulation EPCs insulin therapy may result balance marrow mobilisation negative impact increase adiposity . Therefore , use weight-neutral insulin , insulin detemir , may provide additional benefit increase EPC pool . Study design Randomised cross-over trial compare insulin detemir insulin glargine add current oral antidiabetic regimen poorly-controlled ( HbA1câ‰¥8.5 % ) type 2 diabetic patient cardiovascular disease . The crossover design allow control previous treatment provide thorough comparison two treatment investigation . Recruitment randomization perform 6 month . 1 . Basal measurement ( time zero ) 2 . Randomization receive insulin detemir glargine ( time zero ) 3 . First 3 month treatment 4 . Ad interim measurement ( 3 month ) 5 . Shift insulin 3 month 6 . Final measurement ( 6 month ) Initial result available 6 12 month begin study , depend upon time need recruitment .
