	<brief_summary>Mohs ' micrographic surgery ( MMS ) treatment choice high recurrence risk basal-cell carcinoma ( BCC ) . Realized local anaesthesia , induces low recurrence rate spar unnecessary excision intact surround tissue , thus decrease need flap , skin graft , allow immediate reconstruction… . Its disadvantage mainly : need significant training operator , pathologist non-medical personnel ; long duration procedure , high priori cost , constraint patient relate duration intervention . Traditional surgical excision immediate differ reconstruction technique reference . Provided re-excisions perform long previous one guarantee free margin , give good result . Its real cost poorly know enhanced several consideration : multiplicity operational act initial excision insufficient , complex reconstruction procedure , duration post-operative dressing , … . The investigator ' objective know cost surgical treatment high risk CBC , compare CMM surgical excision immediate differ reconstruction , along effectiveness define absence recurrence . impact quality life patient . It prospective , multicentric , comparative , randomize , open , cohort study , type `` elsewhere '' . Patients high-risk CBC , define French ANAES Guidelines ( 2004 ) , include : - clinically morpheaform aspect ill-limited margin , aggressive histological form ; - already recur BCC ( except superficial BCCs ) ) ; - nodular BCC locate high-risk zone ( nose , peri-orificial area head ) diameter large 1 cm . The effectiveness measure rate recurrence 5 year ( measure prolongation follow-up surgical procedure ) . The utility patient point view evaluate specific dermatologic quality life questionnaire ( Skindex ) generic questionnaire ( Euroqol 5D ) , supplement questionnaire satisfaction care ( Attkisson ) . The economic perspective study hospital , payer society . Direct medical cost evaluate micro-costing . The main production factor imply realization one CMM one traditional surgery dermatology/surgery anatomopathology ward identify , count , develop . The measure unit estimate time devote individual procedure , report total activity ward wag various category personnel imply , unit cost consumable redeemable material , report utilisation factor . The hospital indirect cost estimate financial service hospital . Accrual 150 CMM 300 traditional excision perform within two year period time .</brief_summary>
