	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Patients Diagnosed With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine IGIV3I Grifols 10 % consistently effective treatment patient diagnose immune thrombocytopenic purpura respect : 1 . Increase platelet count ≥ 50x10^9/L ( primary objective ) . 2 . Time take platelet count reach ≥ 50x10^9/L . 3 . The length time platelet count remain ≥ 50x10^9/L . 4 . The maximum platelet level . 5 . Regression bleed episode first 10 14 day . To determine IGIV3I Grifols 10 % safe respect : Nature , severity frequency adverse reaction infusion percentage subject percentage infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Be age 18 82 time write consent . 2 . Have confirm diagnosis chronic ITP fulfil follow criterion : irrelevant history except symptom bleed , pattern bleeding associate platelet disorder , physical examination irrelevant ITP , except sign bleed , isolate thrombocytopenia blood count ; apart thrombocytopenia , blood count normal patient 's age , abnormal , readily explain , peripheral blood smear consistent ITP : thrombocytopenia platelet normal size slightly large normal , absence platelet clump giant platelet ; normal red blood cell white blood cell morphology , confirm diagnosis immune thrombocytopenic purpura , abnormal finding present , additional diagnostic evaluation exclude cause thrombocytopenia . Previous know diagnosis ITP least 3 month . 3 . To show platelet count platelet count ≤ 20x10^9/L moment first infusion study product . 4 . Have read patient information consent sheet , agree participate trial , sign consent sheet . 5 . Be expect receive treatment 5 day followup 3 month . 6 . For woman childbearing age , use adequate contraceptive method oral contraceptive , intrauterine device tubal ligation onemonth period first infusion study . 1 . Have immune thrombocytopenia secondary pathology drug mediate thrombocytopenia . 2 . Have know diagnosis autoimmune disease , establish medical history laboratory finding positive result determination antinuclear antibody , anticardiolipin antibody , lupus anticoagulant direct Coombs test . 3 . Present important active bleeding due reason apart ITP . 4 . Exhibit identifiable alternative cause thrombocytopenia , splenomegaly , family thrombocytopenia , bacteraemia , sepsis active infection require therapy . 5 . Are present renal dysfunction . 6 . Have noncontrolled arterial hypertension . 7 . Have document liver cirrhosis hepatic disorder alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level 2.5 time normal upper limit bilirubin great 2 mg/dL . 8 . Are present cardiac disease include history coronary artery disease , angina pectoris congestive heart failure . 9 . Present known infection due HIV hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . 10 . Have previously treat IVIG antiD immunoglobulin unresponsive . 11 . Have history serious adverse reaction nonserious frequent adverse reaction intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) preparation product derive blood . 12 . Have know allergy IGIV3I Grifols component , Dsorbitol . 13 . Are simultaneously participate clinical study receive investigational drug 3 month prior start study . 14 . Have involve present study treat formulation 5 % ( IGIV3I Grifols 5 % ) . 15 . Have condition might affect patient compliance . 16 . Are unable provide storage serum sample first dose IGIV3I Grifols . 17 . Are pregnant nursing infant child unwilling practice adequate birth control 1month period first infusion study .</criteria>
