	<brief_summary>The present study defines blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , prospective study , aim determine influence effective treatment Type 1 angiotensin II ( Ang II ) receptor ( AT-1R ) antagonist , use candesartan ( target dose 16 mg ) stenotic aortic valve . The investigator specifically quantify whether candesartan attenuates key pathogenic mechanism aortic valve stenosis , namely inflammation , fibrosis , elastin degradation , calcification , neovascularization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We include study 120 consecutive patient clinically significant , symptomatic aortic stenosis refer Helsinki University Central Hospital consideration valve replacement surgery . Patients put hospital 's normal wait list elective angiography ( i.e need urgent surgery ) give inform consent , randomize two group start therapy candesartan ( 8 mg/d 2 week , 16 mg/d surgery ) placebo . On average , overall duration drug intervention 3 month , i.e. , average time institution referral surgery . In addition , patient ( n=50 ) undergo aortic valve replacement surgery due aortic regurgitation cause dilation aortic root include . This population consist patient early sclerotic , i.e. , pre-stenotic , change aortic valve ( n=30 ) patient without sclerotic stenotic change aortic valve ( n=20 ) . The group sclerotic change aortic valve ( n=30 ) divide two group receive candesartan ( 8 mg/d 2 wk , 16 mg/d surgery ) ( n=15 ) placebo ( n=15 ) . The removed aortic valve examine utilizing real-time PCR , autoradiography , fluorometry , immunohistochemistry , double immunofluorescence , confocal microscopy , enzyme immunoassay . With technique , several marker inflammation , calcification , fibrosis , amount lipid accumulation oxidation LDL valve examine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>120 consecutive patient clinically significant , symptomatic aortic stenosis refer Helsinki University Central Hospital consideration valve replacement surgery . Individuals past myocardial infarction , mild mitral valve disease , previous cardiac surgery exclude . Patients heart failure need urgent surgery hypotension ( systolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg ) exclude . Patients already take ACE inhibitor AT1R antagonist exclude study population . Other exclusion criterion include follow : Complicated diabetes Primary cardiomyopathy Pregnant woman , woman breast feeding , woman childbearing potential use chemical mechanical contraception positive serum pregnancy test History malignancy ( unless document disease free period exceed 5years present ) exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Women history cervical dysplasia would permit enter study provide 3 consecutive clear Papanicolaou ( Pap ) smear Hypothyroidism ( TSH 1.5xULN ) History alcohol drug abuse within last 5 year ( may affect compliance ) Unexplained creatine kinase ( CK 3xULN ) ( To protect patient safety ) Serum creatinine &gt; 176 umol/L ( 2.0mg/dL ) Participation another investigational drug study le 4 week enrolment study , accord subject local ethic committee requirement large period stipulate ( avoid potential misinterpretation overlap adverse event )</criteria>
