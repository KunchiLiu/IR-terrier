	<brief_summary>Revlimid® ( Lenalidomide ) indicate type blood cancer , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , 10mg specific type myelodysplastic syndrome genetic abnormality call `` deletion 5q '' Low Intermediate-1 ( INT-1 ) patient ( stag system accord International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) ) . The purpose Phase I/II study determine optimal dose Revlimid® ( Lenalidomide ) MDS Low MDS INT-1 patient without deletion 5q slowly increase dose monitoring blood count safety evaluation well observe adverse event . Efficacy also observe phase II portion study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Range Finding Study Lenalidomide Non-5q Chromosome Deletion Low Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little option non deletion 5q Low INT-1 patient . This study aim find early clinical signal high activity well response lenalidomide patient non deletion 5q Low INT-1 MDS patient . Lenalidomide immunomodulatory agent . Thalidomide , parent compound , immunomodulatory anti-angiogenic property could confer anti-tumor anti-metastatic effort . Lenalidomide demonstrate possess anti-angiogenic activity inhibition basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) induce endothelial cell migration ( movement cell preparation form new abnormal blood vessel cancer cell ) , due least part inhibition Akt phosphorylation response bFGF . In addition , lenalidomide variety immunomodulatory effect . Lenalidomide stimulate T cell proliferation , production interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-10 interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , inhibit IL-1 beta IL-6 modulate IL-12 production . Although exact anti-tumor mechanism action lenalidomide unknown , number mechanism postulate activity Lenalidomide MDS .</detailed_description>
