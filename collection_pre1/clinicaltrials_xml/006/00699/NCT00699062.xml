	<detailed_description>Accumulated data suggest distal lung , include airway &lt; 2mm diameter lung parenchyma , contribute asthma pathogenesis symptom . In addition persist inflammation , distal lung undergoes remodel , demonstrate reduce elastic fiber content abnormal alveolar attachment , latter think result loss elastic recoil reduction FEV1.0 . Furthermore , recent study show airway remodel observe early onset disease may , therefore , characteristic asthma . Amounting evidence reveal airway remodel asthmatic airway account large component airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) excessive airway narrow . Since remodel process occur parallel , may even obligatory , establishment persistent inflammation , pathogenesis airway remodel implication therapeutic intervention design diminish airway remodel remain important area research clinic . Inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) mainstay treatment asthma , however , ICS provide little benefit airway remodel . Cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLT ) play important role pathogenesis airway remodel antileukotrienes work exert certain degree anti-inflammatory effect . The cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist Montelukast , example , vivo show significantly inhibit ovalbumin induced airway smooth muscle hyperplasia subepithelial fibrosis sensitize mouse . Montelukast , systemically deliver leukotriene receptor antagonist , strongly recommend treat asthma several guideline . Clinically , systemically act oral agent montelukast show improve proximal distal lung physiology . In particular , improvement distal lung function correlate improvement asthma symptom . The vivo experiment perform rodent animal challenge OVA show Montelukast reverse airway remodel , well inhibit inflammation . To determine occurrence airway remodel human , bronchial biopsy sample obtain bronchoscope subject histological examination . However , bronchial biopsy invasive cause considerable pain , assessment peripheral small airway change deep submucosal tissue airway smooth muscle large airway technically difficult . This technique allow longitudinal analysis airway wall dimension . Noninvasive evaluation airway mean image high-resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) therefore try alternative procedure , find potential evaluate airway patient obstructive pulmonary disease . The measurement airway wall thickness HRCT patient asthma demonstrate correlate severity asthma . Computed tomographic imaging airway HRCT widely apply investigate alteration structure airways term airway remodel patient airway obstructive disease ( see reference 1-4 ) . So far knowledge , study aim evaluate Montelukast could reverse airway remodel asthma patient HRCT . Our encouraging preliminary data perform 4 patient moderate severe asthma accord GINA definition receive oral Montelukast 3 month demonstrate without combination ICS+LABA significant improvement airway wall thickness air trap evaluate measurement HRCT lung function patient oral Montelukast compare without oral Montelukast . We adopt WA % WA/BSA reflect degree airway thickness publish method . We find patient received oral montelukast 3 month experienced improvement airway remodel . WA/BSA WA % significantly decrease compare baseline . The purpose proposal present examine , relatively large number patient , Montelukast improve structural change large airway air trap mean HRCT , relationship pulmonary function patient moderate severe asthma .</detailed_description>
