	<brief_summary>A total 20 subject participate four week , group , double-blind , placebo control study . Subjects participate two experimental session separate approximately one week . Subjects randomize receive either 50 mg cycloserine placebo combine cue exposure . Several physiological subjective outcome measure ( e.g. , heart rate , blood pressure , galvanic skin response ) obtain session . Experimental session last approximately 4.5 hour follow-up session last approximately thirty minute . Our aim : 1 . To examine effect cycloserine vs. placebo extinction smoke cue reactivity overnight abstinent smoker . Reactivity smoke cue capture self-report smoking urge physiological measure ( heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance ) . We hypothesize cycloserine , relative placebo , facilitate extinction smoke cue reactivity . 2 . To examine effect cycloserine vs. placebo combine two 4.5 hour laboratory cue exposure training session , smoke behavior smoker . Smoking behavior measure self-report smoking saliva cotinine level . 3 . To examine effect cycloserine vs. placebo memory performance nicotine dependent smoker . Memory performance measure verbal learning , recognition recall task . 4 ) To examine safety tolerability cycloserine treatment smoker . We hypothesize cycloserine well tolerated smoker .</brief_summary>
