	<brief_summary>Patients undergone vitro fertilization ( IVF ) produce four less follicle four less oocyte ( egg ) retrieve often refer poor responder . We refer patient point forward `` low responder '' avoid use potentially offensive label . We currently use 2 different IVF medication protocol practice treat low responder patient infertility : `` Microdose Leuprolide '' protocol `` Luteal Phase Ganirelix '' protocol . We would like conduct randomized-controlled trial randomize patient one treatment group determine medication protocol effective treat infertility group patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Microdose Leuprolide Protocol vs. Luteal Phase Ganirelix Protocol Women Who Are Who Are Predicted Low Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women demonstrate suboptimal response control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) challenge treat assist reproductive technology vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . Such patient often refer clinically medical literature poor responder . A variety different protocol study used treat patient . One protocol use treat poor responder microdose leuprolide flare protocol 1,2 . This widely-used protocol first described 1997 Schoolcraft et al . 1 The microdose leuprolide flare protocol name administration gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) early follicular phase cause initial rise endogenous gonadotropin call `` flare '' cause downregulation suppression gonadotropin . Use oral contraceptive pill ( OCPs ) precede cycle prevents corpus luteum formation could support exogenous GnRH-a subsequent cycle . The microdose leuprolide flare protocol show safe effective protocol may lead decreased cycle cancellation rate increase clinical ongoing pregnancy rate poor responder 2,3 . The development GnRH antagonists lead additional treatment option poor responder 4 . With GnRH antagonist use , suppression early follicular phase may avoid . The GnRH antagonist add late follicular phase prevent LH surge . This protocol may enable poor responder recruit follicles early follicular phase thus optimal response stimulation . A randomized-controlled multicenter trial compare GnRH antagonist ganirelix GnRH agonist ( Buserelin , intranasal preparation ) patient use recombinant FSH ( rFSH ) show ganirelix safe well-tolerated 5 . They find mean duration stimulation 1 day short ganirelix group group use significantly less rFSH . A randomized-controlled clinical trial poor responder compare use ganirelix microdose leuprolide acetate ( GnRH-a ) patient undergo COH IVF find outcomes similar group 6 . There differences total number day stimulation , amount rFSH use , peak estradiol level , number oocyte retrieve , fertilization rate , implantation rate , pregnancy rate . However , study limit small sample size . Another randomized-controlled trial Akman et al . 7 compare use microdose leuprolide GnRH antagonist ( Cetrotide ) poor responder undergo IVF . They find difference implantation rate clinical pregnancy rate also limit small sample size . In IVF cycle , poor responder often develop dominant follicle multiple small follicle rather multiple large follicle goal treatment . In case , IVF cycle often cancel . The physiology behind asynchronous follicular growth COH poorly understood . Such discrepant growth may result size difference early antral follicle 8 . It also possible premature FSH elevation occur late luteal phase menstrual cycle play role process 9 . FSH prevents follicular atresia end luteal phase10 . Some follicle intrinsically sensitive FSH able respond low level hormone others . Given fact large follicle often FSH-responsive small follicle , make sense exogenous gonadotropin may lead worsen follicular asynchrony COH 11 . It recently show use estradiol luteal phase precede menstrual cycle may facilitate growth follicle coordinate fashion 8 , 11 . Fanchin et al.11 prospectively studied 90 woman undergo IVF cycle use GnRH antagonist randomly assign receive either 4 mg oral micronized estradiol cycle day 20 day 2 next cycle serve control receive estradiol treatment . They find group receive estradiol significantly small follicle day 8 cycle less discrepancy follicle size.. The group receive estradiol also follicles 16 mm great , mature oocyte , embryo control group . The clinical pregnancy rate great estradiol group although find statistically significant ( 34 vs. 25 % ) . Recently , GnRH antagonists also show coordinate follicular size subsequent growth use luteal phase precede menstrual cycle 12,13 . Dragesic et al . 13 develop novel protocol poor responder incorporate transdermal estradiol ( E2 ) GnRH antagonist use luteal phase , follow gonadotropin stimulation follicular phase addition GnRH antagonist late follicular phase . From point , protocol refer Luteal Phase Ganirelix ( LPG ) Protocol . During LPG protocol , subject apply 0.1 mg transdermal estradiol patch 10th day LH surge replace patch fresh 0.1 mg patch every day . On second day patch use , subject begin take daily ganirelix acetate 0.25 mg subcutaneously 3 day . Subjects present ultrasound day 2 menses FSH , LH , E2 ultrasound stimulation start per protocol gonadotropin ( rFSH human menopausal gonadotropin ( HMG ) ) . Ganirelix start 13mm follicle measure ultrasound , E2 exceed 300 pg/mL , cycle day 7 . Human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) give final oocyte maturation oocyte retrieval perform 35-36 hour later . All embryo transfer perform 72 hour oocyte retrieval . This retrospective study 68 subject compare response LPG protocol response prior IVF cycle protocol , include microdose leuprolide , low-dose leuprolide , coflare protocol . They find patient use LPG Protocol significantly low cycle cancellation rate , oocytes retrieve , mature oocyte , normally fertilize oocyte , embryo available transfer compare prior cycle . Patients use gonadotropin LPG protocol day stimulation , although latter statistically significant . Our goal propose study determine whether Microdose Leuprolide LPG Protocols equally efficacious treat poor responder .</detailed_description>
