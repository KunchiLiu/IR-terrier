	<brief_title>Role Pioglitazone Berberine Treatment Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedentary lifestyle poor dietary choice lead weight gain epidemic increase risk develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . NAFLD group diseases much fat liver absence excess alcohol consumption . NAFLD encompass histological spectrum range simple hepatic steatosis nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , advanced fibrosis , cirrhosis . NAFLD estimate affect 25 % worldwide population [ 1 ] 15.35 % adult shanghai urban area [ 2 ] . Epidemiological data show fatty liver may predict , independent factor , metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease . Therefore , may prevent disease treat NAFLD.Life style intervention include activity reduce energy intake recommend health care provider optimal health common prescribe therapy individual diagnose NAFLD . TZDs oral glucose-lowering medication use treat type 2 diabetes enhance insulin sensitivity . The strong relationship insulin resistance NAFLD suggest insulin sensitize therapy TZDs might beneficial prevention improvement NAFLD.TZDs bind peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARs ) , part , facilitate enhance TG storage adipocytes , suppress ectopic storage lipid liver skeletal muscle . In addition , TZDs appear anti-inflammatory property , inhibit adipocyte gene expression reduce circulating level TNFα [ 3 ] resistin [ 4 ] , increase adiponectin concentration [ 5 ] . Some research demonstrate pioglitazone ( TZD ) significantly reduce liver fat content NAFLD , ameliorate biological parameter liver histology NASH [ 6 ] . However , similar data treat chinese NAFLD pioglitazone . Berberine ( BBR ) , compound isolate Chinese herb identify Weijia [ 7 ] new cholesterol-lowering drug mechanism different statin drug . BBR elevate LDL receptor ( LDLR ) expression post-transcriptional mechanism stabilize LDLR-mRNA . Considering close relationship NAFLD lipid metabolism , assume BBR may effective NAFLD improve lipid metabolism . In order evaluate hypothesis , plan treat group NAFLD patient impair glucose regulation ( IGR ) T2DM pioglitazone BBR randomize , open , control trial 16 week .</detailed_description>
