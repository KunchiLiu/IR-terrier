	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving erlotinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well erlotinib work treat patient breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine situ antitumor effect neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride measure reduction Ki67 and/or increase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) -positive tumor cell patient treatment-naive , operable breast cancer . Secondary - To identify molecular profile , base measurement Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , Human Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 ( HER2 ) , protein expression profile patient treatment-naïve , operable breast cancer responsive erlotinib hydrochloride . - To correlate tumor concentration erlotinib hydrochloride serum level immediately surgery . OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily 5-14 day . Patients undergo surgical resection within 24 hour last dose erlotinib hydrochloride . Tumor tissue sample collect baseline surgery correlative laboratory study . Tissue sample stain ER , HER2 , EGFR level , proliferation ( Ki67 ) , apoptosis ( TUNEL ) immunohistochemistry . Levels erlotinib hydrochloride tissue sample measure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry . Blood sample collect day surgery . Levels erlotinib hydrochloride blood sample measure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry . Patients follow within 6 week surgery .</detailed_description>
