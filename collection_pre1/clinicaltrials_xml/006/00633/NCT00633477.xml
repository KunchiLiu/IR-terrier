	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Resatorvid Patients With Sepsis-induced Cardiovascular Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis major cause in-hospital death , high mortality rate event stroke acute myocardial infarction , le 20 % risk death first 30 day . Sepsis clinical condition cause innate inflammatory host response systemic infection result organ failure potentially death . Under certain circumstance , many component innate immune response normally involved host defense cause cell tissue damage subsequently multiple organ failure , clinical hallmark severe sepsis . The host response infection characterize synthesis release proinflammatory cytokine . Cytokines release signal transmit surface inflammatory cell , bind pathogen-associated molecule cell surface pattern recognition receptor know toll-like receptor . TAK-242 ( resatorvid ) toll-like receptor 4 inhibitor clinical development treatment patient severe sepsis . Study participation anticipate 28 day , additional 9 month follow-up period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Suspected proven bacterial fungal infection patient receive parenteral antimicrobial therapy . Developed least 3 4 follow systemic inflammatory response syndrome criterion within 36 hour prior start study drug administration : A temperature site great 38째C ( great 100.4째F ) core temperature le 36째C ( less 96.8째F ) . Heart rate great 90 beat per minute . If subject know medical condition ( eg , heart block ) receiving treatment ( eg , beta blocker ) would prevent tachycardia , 2 remain 3 criterion systemic inflammatory response syndrome must meet . Respiratory rate great 20 breath per min arterial partial pressure carbon dioxide less 32 mm Hg mechanical ventilation acute process . A total white blood cell absolute count great 12,000 cell per mm3 le 4,000 cells/mm3 ; white blood cell differential count show great 10 % immature ( band ) form . Has septic shock diagnose within 36 hour prior study drug administration.. Has develop respiratory failure within 36 hour prior study drug administration . Females childbearing potential sexually active must agree use adequate contraception , neither pregnant lactating Screening throughout duration study . Exclusion Criteria Received investigational compound within 30 day ( 5 halflives drug , whichever long ) prior initiation study drug infusion participate another investigational study , include investigational compound , without prior approval Vanderbilt Coordinating Center sponsor . Currently receive immunosuppressive therapy ( exclude glucocorticoid ) methotrexate , azathioprine , anti tumor necrosis factor alpha , cancer relate chemotherapeutic agent . Known history glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency . Methemoglobin level great equal 5 % pretreatment period know history methemoglobinemia . Moribund death consider imminent . Prior onset sepsis , subject would otherwise expect survive 28 day complete functional recovery due preexist unstable medical condition ( eg , recent acute cerebral hemorrhage infarct , recent acute unstable myocardial infarction , severe traumatic injury ) . Poorly control metastatic neoplasm . The participant , participant 's family physician commit full aggressive management presence unstable medical condition make receipt full aggressive management support unlikely view coordinate center . Severe end stage chronic respiratory failure lung disease significantly impair physical function equivalent New York Heart Association functional classification III IV . Documented history moderate severe chronic heart failure define New York Heart Association functional classification III IV . Received electrocardioversion pulseless rhythm chest compression current hospitalization . Known immunocompromised subject human immunodeficiency virus CD4 count le 50 mm3 , primary immune deficiency chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Chronic end stage hepatic failure significant sequela chronic hepatic failure ( eg , esophageal varix , jaundice , chronic ascites ) ChildPugh hepatic impairment Classification C. In chronic vegetative state similar longterm neurological impairment , continue aggressive care would unlikely . Acute third degree burn involve 30 % body surface area within 120 hour first qualify organ failure . Known hypersensitivity sulphonamides . Known hypersensitivity component resatorvid ; example , allergic egg , egg product , soybean .</criteria>
