	<brief_summary>Subjects ask participate clinical trial examine safety 2-deoxyglucose ( agent quite similar glucose ) treatment solid tumor hormone refractory prostate cancer . This agent work block metabolism glucose cell body . Although cell require glucose metabolism , believe cancer cell require significantly glucose normal cell grow . Therefore , even slight effect glucose metabolism cancer cell might result shrinkage certain cancer . This agent give human cause mild nausea , vomit glucopenia ( low blood sugar ) dose give study . This study examine safety 2-deoxyglucose treatment advance solid tumor hormone refractory prostate cancer . The information obtain study use design future clinical study 2-deoxyglucose . Subjects asked take oral solution 2-deoxyglucose daily , mouth , study . They ask CT Scans , Bone Scans , optional PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) Scans prior start study . PET scan also perform shortly start study 2 cycle ( 6 week ) therapy . Subjects ask comprehensive physical examination blood work prior start study . During first 2 cycle study subject ask blood drawn different time interval first 2 day cycle . While study , ask return clinic interval 1 week physical examination blood test . Subjects also ask CT Scans Bone Scans interval 9 week study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically proven metastatic solid tumor malignancy , without standard option therapy eligible Phase I portion trial . Patients prostate cancer metastatic disease , progression initial hormonal therapy eligible Phase I II portion trial . Phase II patient must either measurable disease PSA value &gt; 5 ng/ml . Patients prostate cancer bicalutamide flutamide recently withdraw , must demonstrate progression disease least 6 week 4 week respectively beyond discontinuation agent . LHRH agonists continue . Age &gt; 18 year estimate life expectancy least 6 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . ( see Appendix B ) Patients must ³ 4 week since last prior therapy ( include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy ) . All previous clinically significant treatmentrelated toxicity resolve less equal Grade 1 . An ANC &gt; 1500/µl , hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl , platelet count &gt; 100,000/µl require . Adequate renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ) Total bilirubin must within normal limit . Transaminases ( SGOT and/or SGPT ) must less 2.5X institutional upper limit normal . Serum potassium within institutional limit normal . Fasting blood glucose &lt; institutional ULN . In Phase I portion study patient may prior chemotherapy . In Phase II portion study patient may prior chemotherapy . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( Phase I trial ) . Men woman childbearing potential must consent use effective contraception treatment 3 month thereafter . Known infection HIV . Patients without prior HIV testing require test . History glucose intolerance . Patients ongoing coagulopathies and/or receive oral anticoagulant . Second primary malignancy except situ carcinoma ( e.g . situ carcinoma cervix , adequately treat nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin ) malignancy treat least 5 year previously evidence recurrence . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event Patients diabetes mellitus , hypoglycemia , history seizure disorder , know autonomic dysfunction , clinically significant uncontrolled gastrointestinal disorder , know G6PD deficiency , allergy methylparaben propylparaben exclude , base know potential toxicity . The effect 2deoxyglucose develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason Agent Class well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 3 month thereafter . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Active clinically significant infection require antibiotic . History clinically significant unexplained episode hypotension , fainting , dizziness , lightheadedness.5.2.10 History symptom cardiovascular disease ( NYHA Class 2 , 3 , 4 ; see Appendix D , New York Heart Association Criteria ) within last 6 month , particularly coronary artery disease , arrhythmia , conduction defect risk cardiovascular instability , uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant pericardial effusion , congestive heart failure . History transient ischemic attack , stroke , seizure disorder CNS disease consider significant investigator . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery . Antitumor therapy within 28 day start study treatment ( within 6 4 week bicalutamide flutamide , respectively ) . Phase I : Inability discontinue prohibit medication 24 hour dose Cycle 1 , Day 1 Weeks 1 2 . Patients unable ( per Investigator discretion ) unwilling give write informed consent .</criteria>
