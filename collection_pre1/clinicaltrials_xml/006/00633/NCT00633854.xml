	<brief_summary>The objective research improve care ocular disease disorder , particular change eye associate diabetes , provide clinician dramatically improve ultrasonic image entire eye . The research combine advance high-frequency , high-resolution ultrasonic annular array transducer new process technique design overcome several limit reach conventional high-frequency ultrasound system . We propose diagnosis eye disease use annular array effective conventional ultrasound image least 50 % ; i.e. , every 2 posterior vitreous detachment detect conventionally , 3 detect annular array .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , deploy annular-array system assess experimental clinical utility ophthalmic imaging . We hypothesize 20-MHz annular array detect posterior vitreous detachment ( PVD ) reliably conventional single element ultrasound system . Clinically , test hypothesis 20-MHz annular array improve detection PVD , important risk factor disease progression diabetic retinopathy . Diabetic retinopathy lead cause blindness work population ( 25 65 year ) third major cause legal blindness U.S. We propose carry study 30 human subject , age 60 year , PVD likely present consequence normal age . The study compare ability detect PVD use commercial ophthalmic ultrasound system equip 10- 20-MHz sector scan probe ( Cinescan A/B-S , Quantel Medical ) , OCT ( OCT/SLO , Ophthalmic Technologies , Inc. ) , 20-MHz annular array . The annular array use synthetic focusing simulate single-element mode . The end point fraction eye PVD visualize technique . This comparison design demonstrate improvement ability visualize pathologic entity use advanced signal processing mode explore study . PVD represent risk factor retinal detachment retinal neovascularization diabetic localization vitreoretinal traction point may crucial management . The present study , however , limited visualization PVD old normal subject , 75 % would expect PVD present . Thus , aim purely develop improved imaging modality rather demonstrate clinical efficacy management diabetic retinopathy ocular disease . The image technology develop could potentially result patent intellectual property , would manage Cornell Research Foundation Riverside Research Institute .
