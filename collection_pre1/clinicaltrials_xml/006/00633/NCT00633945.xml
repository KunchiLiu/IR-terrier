	<brief_title>Evaluation Lenalidomide ( REVLIMID® ) Treat Subjects With Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus ( CLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) chronic often disable disease affect skin . Many patient experience scar inflammation skin , often occur face . Moderate severe CLE frequently treat antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine , quinacrine chloroquine . Up 70 % CLE patient treated antimalarial experience beneficial clinical response , remainder patient show response continue experience progression disease . Thalidomide use successfully patient , 75 % clinical response rate refractory CLE patient . However , thalidomide know teratogen cause severe birth defect , include short , malformed limbs damage peripheral nerve extremity , require patient monitored pregnancy . In addition , 25 % patient thalidomide develop peripheral neuropathy . A new drug , lenalidomide ( REVLIMID® ) , analogue thalidomide , develop treat neoplastic inflammatory condition , include various oncologic condition multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic syndrome solid tumor . Unlike thalidomide , lenalidomide ( REVLIMID® ) know cause extent serious side effect cause thalidomide ; however , must also monitor side effect distribute RevAssist program authorize drug manufacturer , Celgene Corporation . The primary goal investigator-initiated , small pilot study evaluate safety effectiveness lenalidomide ( REVLIMID® ) CLE subject use measurement CLASI ( Cutaneous Lupus Activity Severity Index ) . The study drug use off-label indication treat 6 subject , lenalidomide ( REVLIMID® ) provide cost drug manufacturer . Men woman age 18 , biopsy proven diagnosis refractory CLE fail standard treatment hydroxychloroquine three month , include study . Secondarily , study evaluate biologic effect lenalidomide pathogenic immunologic mechanism CLE disease process treatment period collect skin specimen ( biopsy ) blood sample .</detailed_description>
