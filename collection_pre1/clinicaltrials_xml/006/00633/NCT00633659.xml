	<brief_title>Pilot Study Hemospan® Patients With Chronic Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemospan® novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier develop perfuse oxygenate tissue risk ischemia hypoxia . Because molecular size oxygen bind characteristic , Hemospan selectively off-loads oxygen tissue predispose low oxygen tension . Preclinical evidence suggest Hemospan provide volume expansion enhances tissue perfusion . Hemospan therefore develop oxygen-carrying plasma expander patient tissue risk inadequate perfusion oxygenation . In patient chronic critical low limb ischemia ( CCLI ) , primary cause ischemic symptom leg insufficient perfusion . As many patient suffer CCLI elderly concomitant disease , surgical procedure may always possible . The goal treatment improve blood flow nutritional vessel ischemic area ; one possibility may use oxygen-carrying plasma expander . Hemospan show improve oxygenation tissue preserve functional capillary density . In addition , Hemospan high affinity oxygen - feature specifically design target unload oxygen microcirculation local PO2 level much low ( e.g. , ischemic region ) . Since Hemospan cell-free oxygen carrier , able perfuse capillary constrict red blood cell unable flow .</detailed_description>
