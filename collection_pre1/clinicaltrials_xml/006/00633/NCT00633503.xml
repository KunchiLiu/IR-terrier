	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To develop safe , non-contact , intra-operative &amp; post-operative device , use adjunct clinical evaluation tissue transfer flap reconstructive surgery . 2 . To develop adjunctive device reliably detect distinguish arterial venous occlusion clinical manifestation occlusion , thus provide scientific basis future study may use device potentially improve salvage rate re-exploration complication . 3 . To evaluate change optical property tissue transfer flap immediate post-operative period use predict development late complication tissue transfer flap , development fat necrosis and/or flap atrophy . Specific aim : 1 . To record intra-operative post-operative image pedicle free tissue transfer flap use reconstructive surgery device shine low energy near infrared light spatially modulate sinusoidal configuration amplitude call Modulated Imaging ( MI ) . 2 . To study MI device describe able collect data regard optical property tissue transfer flap , use detect acute post-operative occlusion artery vein go tissue transfer flap . 3 . To study correlation immediate post-operative optical property tissue transfer flap development late complication fat necrosis flap atrophy . Hypotheses : 1 . Prior author demonstrate tissue spectroscopy use animal &amp; human experiment detect differentiate tissue transfer flap adequate vascular supply vs. flap either artery and/or vein occlusion prior detection complication use standard clinical observation post-operative period . These author demonstrate detection change baseline value post-operative period total hemoglobin [ Hb-total ] , deoxygenate hemoglobin [ Hb-deoxy ] , oxygenate hemoglobin [ Hb-O2 ] concentration use tissue spectroscopy correlate clinical development arterial venous occlusion . 1,2 As MI device develop Beckman Laser Institute demonstrate able detect [ Hb-total ] , [ Hb-deoxy ] [ Hb-O2 ] well concentration water , [ H2O ] non-contact manner ; believe MI device also able detect development arterial and/ venous occlusion tissue transfer flap without require direct tissue contact tissue spectroscopy device , case instrument use authors.3 , 4 2 . There high rate fat necrosis flap atrophy occur specific type free tissue transfer flap , [ i.e. , high rate occur Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator ( DIEP ) flap vs. Transverse Rectus Abdominis ( TRAM ) flaps.5 , 6 Some author suggest early flap congestion development late fat necrosis may due venous insufficiency , without complete venous occlusion 7 . We hypothesize early post-operative change flap 's optical property may use predict development late complication fat necrosis flap atrophy , complication think due relative arterial and/or venous insufficiency tissue transfer flap ; thus reflect tissue 's optical property detect MI device . Rationale : The use tissue pedicle free tissue transfer flaps allows increase reconstructive possibility patient disfigurement loss function trauma oncological surgical resection . Generally , process create pedicle tissue transfer flap involve isolation tissue onto single artery vein rotate tissue donor site site require reconstruction . A free tissue transfer flap involve process similar creation pedicle flap except artery vein go flap 's tissue divide re-implanted site reconstruction . This process use tissue transfer flap however know complication , include acute complication arterial venous occlusion late complication development fat necrosis flap atrophy . Acute complication involve vascular structure flap either partial complete occlusion artery vein go tissue flap . Both pedicle free tissue transfer flap develop severe complication either artery vein compromise , include complete death tissue flap . If vascular structure go flap ( ) compromise tissue use reconstructive surgery may undergo damage . This tissue damage become extensive result loss part entire tissue mass tissue transfer flap , turn result increase morbidity mortality patient . In reconstructive surgery literature , show frequent monitoring first 48-72 hour reconstructive surgery allow early detection intervention vascular compromise flap occurs . This early detection translate earlier intervention include surgical re-exploration , show improve salvage rate vascular compromise tissue transfer flaps.8 , 9 It generally know venous thrombosis bad out-come , compare arterial thrombosis surgical re-exploration reestablishment blood flow . This difference arterial venous thrombosis think due difference pathophysiology involve venous congestion . In venous thrombosis tissue fluid content increase due initially continue arterial inflow , thus venous out-flow re-established tissue edema continue inhibit diffusion oxygen interstitial space capillary tissue cell vascular bed edema remain . The fact venous thrombosis difficult clinically detect early may also contribute poor prognosis associate venous thrombosis compare arterial thrombosis.10 Given difficulty early detection venous thrombosis , decrease rate successful salvage surgical re-exploration venous thrombosis , author employ successfully use tissue spectroscopy detect venous thrombosis several hour clinical manifestation thrombosis 2 . These author employ spectroscopy device , require direct contact tissue evaluate provide small surface area tissue flap 's optical property measure . The device , however , able provide diffuse optical tomography rapid wide-field quantitative mapping tissue 's optical property single measurement platform device require direct contact tissue evaluate 3 , 11 . As theMI device new novel device develop Beckman laser Institute use evaluate human tissue transfer flap would pilot study . This pilot study would seek determine specific device also able detect vascular occlusion prior clinical detection occlusion , well differentiate arterial venous occlusion similar manner device use author , employ tissue spectroscopy monitor tissue transfer flap . As mentioned , delayed complication develop tissue transfer flap use reconstructive surgery , include fat necrosis flap atrophy . These late complication think cause relative vascular insufficiency supply flap . It propose increase venous congestion increase rate fat necrosis use DIEP flap compare TRAM flap breast reconstruction due relative venous insufficiency diminish enough cause flap loss , occasion great enough result development fat necrosis 7 . The late development flap atrophy may also due relative arterial venous insufficiency occur time surgical reconstruction , result relative global tissue flap ischemia lead development flap atrophy . One goal experiment determine characteristic optical property tissue transfer flap near post-operative set predict development either fat necrosis flap atrophy . The MI device novel unique device compare spectroscopic device use study tissue transfer flap . MI use non-contact optical imaging technology develop Beckman Laser Institute unique capability perform diffuse optical tomography rapid , wide-field quantitative mapping tissue optical property within single measurement platform . While non-contact spectroscopic device use time-modulation method , MI alternatively use spatially modulate illumination image tissue constituent . The MI system consist 1 ) light projection system illuminate tissue spatial sinusoid pattern , 2 ) CCD camera , collect diffusely reflect light non-contact geometry . The wavelength illumination select bandpass filter broadband source ( i.e . tungsten lamp ) , use monochromatic source ( i.e . laser diode ) . Lastly , tissue fluorescence measurement perform place combination source-blocking bandpass emission filter front camera . 3 , 11 The diffusely reflect amplitude modulate wave carry optical property ( absorption , fluorescence , scatter ) depth information . Specifically , sample depth spatially modulate wave function frequency illumination tissue optical property . This share many analogy broadband frequency-domain photon migration ( FDPM ) approach . { 12 , 13 } Consequently , measurement multiple spatial frequency ( periodicity ) allow MI perform two function . First , use wide range frequency pattern allow depth-selective image thus tomography internal 3D tissue structure . Secondly , rapidly quantitatively map optical absorption , fluorescence yield , scatter coefficient near-real time , high resolution wide field-of-view . The ability separate optical absorption scatter distinguishes MI conventional planar reflectance image method . Absorption scatter map use characterize tissue 's biochemical composition structure . We show intrinsic tissue contrast element vary tissue type , wavelength dependence provide spectral `` fingerprinting '' use delineate spatial relationship among tissue different optical property use determine amount H2O , [ Hb-total ] , [ Hb-deoxy ] , [ Hb-O2 ] &amp; Tissue Oxygen Saturation [ StO2 ] . MI able detect concentration [ Hb-total ] , [ Hb-deoxy ] &amp; [ Hb-O2 ] absolute amount unit millimoles / unit volume tissue measure . MI also able determine percent fraction mass , comprise H2O term percent mass.11 , 14 . This feature critical performance MI quantitative diagnostic method , combine tomographic capability , underscore uniqueness method , potential use monitoring diagnostic device evaluate tissue transfer flap reconstructive surgery .</detailed_description>
