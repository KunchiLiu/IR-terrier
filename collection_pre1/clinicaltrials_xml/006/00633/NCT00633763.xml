	<brief_summary>The pancreas organ play major role digestion food . A part pancreas call islet beta-cells produce insulin , regulate amount glucose ( sugar ) present blood time . Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) , autoimmune disorder characterize destruction pancreatic islet beta-cells ( cell produce insulin ) , affect least million individual US alone . In T1DM , type white blood cell call T lymphocytes attack destroy pancreatic islet beta-cells , leading loss insulin , increase blood glucose , dependence insulin injection survival . Despite rigorous control blood sugar , majority diabetic patient develop serious complication include retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , microangiopathy stroke . Non-invasive method monitor pancreatic beta-cell loss associate type-1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) could improve early diagnosis , provide tool measure responsiveness new therapy , evaluate efficiency pancreatic transplantation graft survival . Our goal develop non-invasive PET-CT imaging method base binding molecule ( 18F-fallypride ) track beta-cell loss progression T1DM . In preliminary study demonstrate specific bind 18F-fallypride D2 receptor rat pancreatic section demonstrate loss pancreatic beta cell streptozotocin-treated rat associate correspond decrease 18F-fallypride binding pancreatic section . A preliminary 18F-fallypride PET-CT study do collaborator Ohio healthy volunteer , reveal 18F-fallypride-uptake pancreas distinguishable surround tissue . Aim-1 project measure variability 18F-fallypride PET-scanning pancreas six healthy volunteer scan twice interval 4-6 week . In Aim-2 project , compare fallypride PET-CT scan 12 patient long-standing T1DM ( nearly beta cell destroy ) 12 age- sex-matched healthy volunteer . If able distinguish two group , future ( ) optimize method able detect 20-30 % loss beta cell , ( b ) perform PET-CT study new-onset T1DM patient at-risk first degree relative T1DM patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>T1DM patient 18 year age , T1DM great 5 year show great 80 % reduction Cpeptide blood level follow intravenous glucagon injection eligible participate study . Healthy control 18 year age , show normal Cpeptide blood level follow intravenous glucagon injection , age sexmatched one T1DM patient include study , eligible participate study . T1DM patient healthy control 18 year age eligible participate study . Pregnant female eligible participate study chance PET/CT scan might risky develop baby . Females physically capable get pregnant require get urine pregnancy test cost PET/CT scan . If pregnancy test positive , T1DM patient healthy control exclude study . The consent form describe risk detail need woman childbearing age undergo pregnancy test . Subjects history psychiatric illness , substance abuse history , clinically significant head trauma , active neurological disease , cardiovascular disease , liver disease renal impairment , claustrophobia ( ( upset afraid small space ) eligible study . Dr. Ping Wang use subject history , blood chemistry , identify individual cardiovascular disease , liver disease , renal impairment . T1DM patient Cpeptide level follow intravenous glucagon injection reduce great 80 % eligible study . Healthy volunteer Cpeptide level follow intravenous glucagon injection reduce great 20 % compare establish control value eligible study . To determine safe procedure , T1DM patient healthy volunteer expect tell researcher radiation exposure individual may ( include diagnostic treatment xrays ) , history head injury , kidney bladder disease , serious medical condition . T1DM patient healthy volunteer expect tell researcher surgical clip metallic prosthesis ( i.e. , replacement body part , hip joint ) pacemaker piece metal body ( shrapnel , metal filing , etc. ) . Patients history alcoholism significant alcohol consumption exclude study . The consent form English , nonEnglish speaker therefore exclude study . Pregnant woman exclude 18Ffallypride radioactive substance , inject patient could hazardous fetus .</criteria>
