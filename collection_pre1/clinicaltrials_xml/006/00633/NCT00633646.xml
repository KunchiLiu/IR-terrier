	<brief_summary>Current therapy recommendation suggest low protein diet preserve residual renal function ( RRF ) start dialysis , high protein intake dialysis prevent protein-energy wasting ( PEW ) . We conduct randomized trial test whether low protein intake also treatment peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) would safe associate preserved RRF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dietary protein major source nitrogen excrete urea kidney , decrease protein intake associate retardation kidney function loss non-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient . While low protein diet recommend end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient start dialysis preserve residual renal function ( RRF ) , current therapy recommendation dialysis normal protein intake less 1.2 g protein/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) /day prevent protein-energy wasting ( PEW ) . We hypothesize low protein intake would safe able slow loss RRF also dialysis patient conduct two prospective , randomized trial involve total 94 peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
