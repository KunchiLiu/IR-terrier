	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine complex lymphedema therapy effective decreasing disease severity improve quality life patient post thrombotic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Trial Post-Thrombotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) spectrum disease manifestation range minor skin discoloration severe skin change venous ulceration . Pain often prominent symptom PTS impair patient quality life . Prevention PTS use compression stocking emphasize . There paucity validate , effective treatment PTS condition develops . While pathophysiology PTS incompletely understand , chronic venous hypertension insufficiency may increase workload lymphatic system result over-capacitance secondary damage eventual lymphatic insufficiency . In selected patient PTS , note symptomatic improvement patient receive lymphedema therapy limb . Complex lymphedema therapy ( CLT ) noninvasive treatment include four key component : meticulous skin care , manual lymph drainage , compression therapy , exercise patient education home management continuation treatment . These technique design enhance lymph flow intact cutaneous lymphatics reduce swell restore function affect limb .</detailed_description>
