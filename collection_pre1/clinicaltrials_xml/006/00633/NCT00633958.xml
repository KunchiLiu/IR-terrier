	<brief_summary>In spite numerous advance neuroimaging technique , diagnosis pediatric brain tumor rely pathologic evaluation material obtain time initial operation . While 18F-FDG-positron emission tomography ( PET ) help identify higher-grade lesion due increase glucose metabolism , high tracer uptake normal adjacent brain make modality limited value . Fluorine-18 fluorothymidine ( FLT ) new image agent two significant advantage image CNS tumor . First , agent detects cellular proliferation directly , second , normal brain take agent , make positive area ( ) easy identify . Before embark large pediatric disease stratify assessment FLT image pediatric neurooncology patient , investigator propose limited patient pilot study evaluate biodistribution , dosimetry specificity compound compare immunohistochemical assessment mitotic activity newly diagnose patient undergo surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study 18F-FLT Pediatric Patients With Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo standard pre-diagnostic imaging site disease use standard MRI technique . If disease suspect brain spine , image modality obtain . This imaging obtain 21 day surgical resection . As close possible completion MRI scan , patient undergo 18F-FLT imaging use single administration tracer , PET image acquisition four different time point ( baseline , 1 hr post injection , 2 hr post injection 4-6 hour post injection ) . A whole body PET scan ( top head mid thigh ) perform immediately injection ( PET acquisition # 1 ) . These data acquire 2 minute emission 2 minute transmission scan bed position . Following acquisition , subject empty bladder . At 45 minute post-injection , brain and/or spine ( body ) PET scan acquire 10 min emission scan 5 min transmission scan ( PET acquisition # 2 ) . This scan include area suspect tumor ( brain , spine , brain spine ) . Following PET acquisition # 2 , whole body PET scan acquire accord protocol ( PET acquisition # 3 ) . If possible , final whole body scan acquire 4-6 h post-injection ( PET acquisition # 4 ) . All PET acquisition acquire 3D mode reconstruct FORE re-binned OSEM algorithm measure attenuation correction . Blood sample obtain completion whole body scan . Patients receive dose 18F-FLT fresh intravenous catheter per standard PET procedure . Patients undergo maximal surgical resection . Pieces different area tumor mark correlation image study possible . Tumor sample undergo standard immunohistochemical analysis cellular activation include mitotic index MIB-1 proliferation stain . Serial blood draw also obtain four different time point ( baseline , 1 hr post injection , 2 hr post injection , 4-6 hour post injection ) evaluate clearance 18F-FLT blood . For biodistribution , 3D region interest ( ROIs ) drawn major organ identify whole body scan . This performed whole body scans time activity curve generate . The residence time organ determine . The blood data pipetted counted estimate activity blood bone marrow . For brain and/or spine image , PET data register subject ' MRI . The PET scan grade subjective 4-point scale . 3D ROIs drawn around tumor . In addition , analogous ROI drawn normal brain background whole brain comparison . For tumor , tumor-to-background , tumor-to-whole brain ratio determine . In addition , standard uptake value ( SUVs ) determine tumor background .</detailed_description>
