	<brief_summary>Lipoprotein ( Lp ) ( ) associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Niacin show low Lp ( ) patient normal moderately elevated level . However , study assess effectiveness niacin Lp ( ) level 30 mg/dl . In addition , study investigate effectiveness niacin include small number patient . Also , Lp ( ) assess secondary endpoint . The aim present study , therefore , evaluate whether Niacin effective compare placebo reduction elevate Lp ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect NICOtinic Acid ( Niacin ) Elevated Lipoprotein ( ) Levels ( NICOLa Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise , multicentre , placebo-controlled , 2-arm , parallel group , phase III , intervention study . Following randomisation visit 1 , subject receive 20 week treatment niacin placebo . The research question : niacin therapy effective lowering elevate Lipoprotein ( Lp ) ( ) level comparison placebo ? Sample size calculation base test equal mean unequal group size ( ratio : treatment group / control group = 2:1 ) . The significance level Î±=0.05 power 90 % . Assuming drop-out rate 20 % , sample size 100 niacin group 50 placebo group . The active ingredient modify ( prolonged , extend ) release tablets nicotinic acid , B-complex vitamin . Modified release tablet contain 500 mg nicotinic acid , daily oral use , used.te 20 % , sample size 100 niacin group 50 placebo group . Subjects recruit consecutively participate lipid clinic . Subjects assess week -4 ( run-in / wash-out ) , 0a+b ( screen phase ) , 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 20 . Descriptive statistic use summarize continuous categorical variable . Mean change Lp ( ) level compare treatment placebo group . Subjects grouped accord treatment randomise ( intention-to-treat , ITT population ) . For miss data , last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . Comparisons group perform use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) treatment factor , adjust baseline Lp ( ) level potential confounders . Subgroup analyse perform accord Lp ( ) phenotype , Lp ( ) baseline level ( &gt; 30-60 mg/dl , &gt; 60 mg/dl ) , concurrent statin therapy ( yes / ) . Risks : Flushing common side effect niacin . Other side effect include gastrointestinal disorder ( common ) ( diarrhoea , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , dyspepsia ) cardiac disorder ( uncommon ) ( tachycardia , palpitation ) . A reversible elevation liver enzymes report , well decrease glucose tolerance , reduction platelet count , increase prothrombin time , elevation uric acid level , reduction phosphorous level ( uncommon rarely ) . Hypersensitivity reaction report rarely . Single report rhabdomyolysis patient combine therapy niacin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) report . Careful monitoring sign symptom myopathy muscle pain , tenderness , weakness therefore required case combination therapy . Benefit : Niacin show improve lipid profile patient reduction total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol triglycerides increase HDL cholesterol . Niacin may also reduce elevate Lp ( ) level may thus lower cardiovascular event long term . The following variable assess prior randomisation : socio-demographic factor , physical examination , medical history , concurrent medication , health-related quality life , cost prior study entry , lipid well laboratory parameter . Lipid parameter include Lp ( ) , total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride . At follow-up , respective laboratory analysis physical examination assess visit . Subjects investigated regard safety tolerability . Health-related quality life cost assess week 9 20 .</detailed_description>
