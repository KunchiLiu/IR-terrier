	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) determine effect herbal formula Sho-saiko-to ( SST ) compare placebo treat hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) person respond current conventional therapy ( peginterferon alfa ribavirin ) relapse conventional therapy contraindicate ; ( 2 ) determine influence SST participant report depression/sadness , fear uncertainty relate HCV disease progression , renewal hope individual ; ( 3 ) collect preliminary data need examine feasibility , patient acceptance , potential limitation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persons infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) suffer multiple symptom cause disease current conventional treatment ( peginterferon alfa ribavirin ) tolerate treatment contraindication take . Most HCV-infected individual eventually develop chronic liver disease may progress complication hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatic decompensation , cirrhosis . What known whether modulation HCV disease use standardize herbal formulation Sho-saiko-to ( SST ) , 3 capsule contain 700 mg SST herbal extract/capsule 28 mg excipients , magnesium stearate silicon dioxide/capsule 2 time day , 12 week might reduce prevent prevalence severity liver deterioration symptom . Thus , objective project : ( ) demonstrate quantitatively sample person infect HCV expect SST treatment-driven change serum level liver enzymes , viral load , CD4+ CD8+ T-cell count longitudinal statistical modeling , correlate severity individual symptom , liver enzyme level , CD4+ CD8+ T-cells measure screening , 4 , 8 , 12 week ; ( b ) examine vitro response line HCV-infected cell standardize herbal formulation ; ( c ) ass mechanism herbal formulation may affect HCV-infected cell vitro . Taken together , clinical laboratory component study provide strong test primary hypothesis compare placebo standardize combine herbal formulation , SST , reduce viral load , liver enzymes , improve CD4+ CD8+ T-cell count person infect HCV respond relapse peginterferon alfa ribavirin conventional therapy contraindicate . Our long-term objective identify basic mechanism underlie chronic HCV infection-related cytokine immune mediator provide rationale mechanism-driven SST disease treatment . Confirming effect SST chronic HCV infection create foundation potentially supportive approach manage HCV disease-related treatment-related symptom . Ability reduce liver damage even prevent side effect conventional therapy use standardize herbal formula , SST , would potential benefit thousand person infect HCV provide herbal treatment current conventional therapy effective contraindicate .</detailed_description>
