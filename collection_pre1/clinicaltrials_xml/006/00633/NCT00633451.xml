	<brief_summary>The purpose randomized double-blind clinical trial determine effectiveness manual therapy patient subacromial impingement syndrome shoulder . We hypothesize combination therapeutic exercise manual therapy shoulder spine effective reduce pain shoulder disability short-term ( 6 wk ) long-term ( 3 , 6 , 12 month ) compare therapeutic exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Rehabilitation Subacromial Impingement Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subacromial impingement syndrome ( SAIS ) frequent cause shoulder pain . Clinical trial investigate effectiveness manual therapy demonstrate improvement outcomes manual therapy add program therapeutic exercise . However , clinical trial ( 3 ) significant limitation generalizability . Two three 3 trial small number subject ( 14 &amp; 22 subject ) 3 trial short term follow ( &lt; 12 week ) use non-validated self report outcome measure . These limitation reduce confidence clinician apply result patient treat SAIS . Clear evidence need justify cost clinician time require perform manual therapy delivery patient care . Therefore , purpose randomized clinical trial examine short-term long-term effectiveness manual therapy addition therapeutic exercise compare therapeutic exercise patient diagnose SAIS .</detailed_description>
