	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study rituximab , bortezomib , lenalidomide first-line second-line treatment patient Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab , Lenalidomide , Bortezomib Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination lenalidomide bortezomib study patient MCL , feasibility tolerability demonstrate patient multiple myeloma . Thus , almost every 2-drug combination rituximab , lenalidomide , bortezomib test , test . We hypothesize three drug important MCL , therefore propose combine 3 agent ( rituximab , bortezomib , lenalidomide ) schedule convenient lymphoma patient . Approximately 18 patient may enrol Phase I portion study . Approximately 45 patient plan enrollment Phase II .</detailed_description>
