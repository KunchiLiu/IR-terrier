	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis study occult catheter-related DVT child cancer common directly contribute development serious catheter complication , specifically bacteremia/fungemia and/or recurrent occlusion catheter tip . Accordingly , anticoagulant treatment clinically silent ( occult ) DVT reduce rate catheter-related infection occlusion , delay therapy need catheter replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-part study initial diagnosis component follow treatment component . The number subject consent diagnosis component 350 , 50 treatment portion ( 25 observation arm , 25 enoxaparin treatment ) . Study Procedures : Patients diagnose cancer Center Cancer Blood Disorders catheter insert cancer relate treatment . After insertion , eligible patient provide consent enrol diagnosis component study . The principal investigator research team monitor catheter complication ( occlusion bacteremia/fungemia ) . After two complication , participant screen occult CVC-related DVT contrast venography , ultrasonography , magnetic resonance venography . If DVT diagnose , participant go study . If DVT diagnose , participant ask consent enroll treatment study . After enrollment , participant randomize two arm observation enoxaparin treatment . After 6 week , patient another image ; represent end treatment period . After follow-up imaging , patient monitor 10 week obtain primary outcome . Once primary outcome ( progression symptomatic DVT/ PE , blood stream infection catheter removal ) achieve participant treat anticoagulation necessary , primary oncologist determine treatment . Analysis : The hypothesis enoxaparin treatment group median adverse catheter event free survival time 12 week versus 4 week control group hazard ration 0.4 . A total sample size 50 ( 25 arm ) detect difference 90 % power α=0.05 . If drop rate 10 % arm , difference still detect 80 % power . Approximately 200 250 patient diagnose cancer year Children 's Medical Center Dallas , base prior institutional experience , two-thirds catheter insert facilitate chemotherapy . However , one-quarter patient brain tumor eligible due potential increase risk intracranial hemorrhage anticoagulation . There 100 patient year risk CVC-related DVT . Based previous study , 50 % patient develop occult DVT ; however , 35 % patient likely screen radiographic imaging . Approximately 17 patient year enrol diagnosis study may diagnose DVT eligible randomization . Therefore , total enrollment complete approximately 3 year additional 4 month necessary complete follow-up period .</detailed_description>
