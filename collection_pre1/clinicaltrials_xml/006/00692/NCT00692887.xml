	<brief_title>Correlation Between Visual Field Defects Foresee Preferential Hyperacuity Perimeter ( PHP ) Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Patients With Choroidal Neovascularization ( CNV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Foresee PHP use recent year detect Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) lesion . The device capable differentiation stage AMD early detection change include choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) The Foresee PHPâ„¢ demonstrate high level sensitivity specificity different stage AMD include newly diagnose early detection CNV . The OCT May use well identify choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Comparison two method allow well understanding device . The Foresee PHP use assessment tool progression success treatment give AMD lesion . Therefore , evaluation size location treat lesion may serve additional tool .</detailed_description>
