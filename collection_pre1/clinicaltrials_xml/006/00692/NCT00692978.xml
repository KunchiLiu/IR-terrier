	<brief_summary>Asthma effectively treat deliver inhaled drug inhaler ( puffer ) directly lung . Inhaled steroid use asthmatic patient dampen lung inflammation , unchecked , often lead patient symptom . Inhalers deliver mist contain particle lot different size ( like hairsprays ) . Medical puffer use patient produce 'coarse ' mist drug particle , potential side effect , different size particle reach different part airway include ; mouth , throat , windpipe , bloodstream ( place want inhaled drug go − give rise important side effect ) , lung ( want drug 'deposit ' ) . Our aim study test inhale steroid give subject 'fine ' mist contain drug particle nearly one size use research nebuliser ( Spinning Top Aerosol Generator ) . We shall use small , intermediate large drug particle mist . We aim find much drug go blood stream particle mist compare standard puffer use routine clinical practice . We hope study provide information rationale improve efficiency drug delivery ( change drug particle size ) one may improve inhaled drug delivery ultimately , clinical patient benefit . Healthy volunteer asthmatic patient recruit Royal Brompton Hospital London . The study fund GlaxoSmithKline , Research &amp; Development , U.K .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Inhaled Monodisperse Fluticasone Propionate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial investigate pharmacokinetic effect ( much drug blood ) Fluticasone Propionate ( Flixotide ) , commonly use steroid drug inhale patient asthma . We use standard clinical Flixotide Nebules use clinical nebuliser ( machine use hospital home − deliver drug patient asthma ) . Current clinical nebuliser deliver 'coarse ' mist drug , potential side effect important consideration steroid . These Flixotide nebule use deliver drug ( fluticasone propionate ) monodisperse aerosol cloud ( drug deliver 'fine ' mist cloud patient ) . In order deliver drug monodisperse aerosol , Flixotide Nebules use spin top aerosol ( large research nebuliser machine ) able selectively generate aerosol cloud fine mist . A fine mist cloud lead less deposition throat patient great control inhale drug reach lung , fine mist drug cloud potential reduce side effect . We also compare use standard routine clinical dose Flixotide metered−dose inhaler ( 'press breathe ' inhaler ) spacer ( plastic bubble end inhaler ) deliver patient .</detailed_description>

Patients able willing give write informed consent take part study 5 . Not take regular medication contraindicate receive fluitcasone propionate ( indicated British National Formularly ) ; oral contraceptive pill . Healthy Volunteers Asthmatics 1 . Those require maintenance oral parenteral corticosteroid therapy airways disease patient cease maintenance oral parenteral corticosteroid therapy within four week prior visit 1 2 . Those require great 500 microgram inhale beclomethasone dipropionate alternative inhale corticosteroid ( budesonide ciclesonide ) . 3 . Subjects receive inhaled intravenous fluticasone propionate last 2 month . 4 . Those whose reversible airway obstruction unstable last four week ( indicated change maintenance therapy ) . 5 . Those participant low respiratory tract infection previous four week 6 . Those donate 450ml blood within previous 1 month . 7 . Those history drug allergy , opinion Unit Physician , contraindicate his/her participation study . 8 . Any evidence positive pregnancy urine test female volunteer females pregnant lactate likely become pregnant trial . Women child−bearing potential may include study , opinion investigator , take adequate contraceptive precaution . 9 . Participants know suspected allergy corticosteroid component formulation and/or Suspected hypersensitivity inhale corticosteroid ( ask directly screen visit ) . 10 . Any patient contraindication take inhaled steroid specifically FP , list British National Formularly enter study 11 . Those experienced acute asthma exacerbation require emergency room treatment and/or hospitalization within one month visit 1 .</criteria>
