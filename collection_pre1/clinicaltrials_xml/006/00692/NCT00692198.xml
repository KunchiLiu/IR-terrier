	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) serious respiratory disease airways lung partially block , result symptom chest tightness , cough , difficulty breathing . Currently , many available treatment manage COPD symptom improve quality life , include medication , lifestyle change , oxygen therapy , pulmonary rehabilitation . For people severe COPD characterize low blood oxygen level rest , long term oxygen therapy help prolong life promote feeling well-being . However , effectiveness supplemental oxygen therapy people COPD characterize moderately low blood oxygen level rest normal blood oxygen rest desaturation exercise know . This study evaluate effectiveness supplemental oxygen therapy treat people COPD moderately low blood oxygen level rest normal blood oxygen level rest , low low blood oxygen level exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD fourth lead cause death United States , 12 million people currently diagnose disease . Risk factor COPD include smoking , environmental exposure lung irritant , genetic predisposition . People COPD often experience symptom chronic cough , shortness breath , excess mucus production , wheeze . In COPD , airways lung chronically obstruct , leave untreated , obstruction cause significant damage lung last disability . The quality life person COPD decrease disease progress , make treat manage COPD moderate stage important . Long-term oxygen therapy show help people severe COPD characterize low blood oxygen level rest live longer healthy life . This study determine whether supplemental oxygen therapy helpful people COPD characterize moderately low blood oxygen level rest normal oxygen level rest low low level exercise . Participation study last least one year 7 year . Potential participant first undergo screen visit include questionnaire , breathe test , measurement rest walk blood oxygen level , brief physical exam , blood draw . Eligible participant return second screen visit , complete questionnaire . At end second visit , eligible participant assign randomly supplemental oxygen therapy oxygen therapy . Participants assign supplemental oxygen therapy receive stationary portable oxygen system . Shortly receive portable oxygen system , participant return 1-hour visit determine much oxygen use walk learn use equipment . Participants low blood oxygen level rest instruct use supplemental oxygen 24 hour per day . Patients normal rest blood oxygen level , low low blood oxygen level exercise instruct use physical activity sleep . Throughout treatment period , participant ask keep record number oxygen tank empty pound oxygen deliver , meter reading , change equipment . Study official contact participant weekly first month , monthly next 5 month , every 2 month Year 1 study visit . Participants also complete form oxygen equipment usage every 2 month . Participants assign receive oxygen treatment contact 1 week study group assignment check-up . All participant return study visit year 7 year . At visit , participant complete test questionnaire screen visit . At Year 1 visit , participant also undergo blood draw . Both treatment group receive two phone call year check status use oxygen . Participants group ask complete quality life questionnaire mail 4 month 16 month . Participants also sign release medical record form year Medicare claim collect time study .</detailed_description>
