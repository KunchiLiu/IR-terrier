	<brief_title>Impact HIV Infection Latent Tuberculosis ( TB ) Among Patients With HIV-TB Co-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During natural course HIV disease , emergence opportunistic infection imposes morbidity HIV-TB co-infected patient , also facilitate viral replication cause faster disease progression . Tuberculosis , commonest among opportunistic infection among HIV infect person deserve special attention . Moreover , disruption latency TB infection ( LTBI ) development severe clinical form relatively early stage HIV disease CD4 count still remain 300/ul , make TB unique opportunistic infection negatively influence outcome dual infection.This suggestive impairment critical immune function involve relatively less frequent fine T cell subset functional hierarchy bulk T cell , weaken immune containment LTBI result reactivation M. tuberculosis manifestation severe form TB.HIV recently report preferentially infect , destroy incapacitate two key immune-regulatory T cell subset , namely NKT Treg cells.Therefore , study along course HIV disease impact change function effector T cell direct M.tuberculosis important .</detailed_description>
