	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability XL147 combination erlotinib ( Tarceva® ) subject solid tumor . XL147 new chemical entity inhibit PI3 Kinase . Inactivation PI3K show inhibit growth induce apoptosis ( program cell death ) tumor cell . Erlotinib orally administer inhibitor EGFR ( also know HER1 ) tyrosine kinase . It approve FDA single agent treatment patient locally advanced metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) failure least one prior chemotherapy regimen combination gemcitabine first line treatment patient locally advance , unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects accrue one two phase : Dose Escalation Phase , subject histologically confirm solid tumor metastatic unresectable long respond therapy know prolong survival standard therapy , disease standard therapy exist monotherapy erlotinib consider standard therapy . Cohort Expansion Phase , subject advance metastatic NSCLC longer respond therapy know prolong survival standard therapy : 1. previously currently treat erlotinib gefitinib 2. agreement sponsor , previously currently treat EGFR/VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor The subject measurable nonmeasurable lesion Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor ( RECIST ) criterion .
