	<brief_summary>The broad objective proposal identify functional neuroanatomical correlate impairment sustain attention smoking abstinence . We measure change performance regional blood oxygenation level use fMRI smoker non-smokers complete task design assess sustain attention—or continuous monitoring stimulus . Our primary hypothesis smoking abstinence result impair sustained attention accompany decrease blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI signal region associate sustained attention include right fronto-parietal cortex , thalamus reticular activation system . Abstinence may also result performance-related increase activation brain region associate effortful processing include anterior cingulate cortex . We also hypothesize smoker satiate state exhibit brain activity similar non-smokers . In addition task relate brain response , also measure change absolute regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) hypothesize abstinence result significant decrease region associate arousal ( e.g. , reticular activation system ) ; information processing ( e.g. , thalamus ) ; emotional regulation ( e.g. , anterior cingulate cortex , prefrontal cortex ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following extended training period performance become stable , smoker test 4 Tesla MRI scanner ( GE LX NVi system ) 24 hour quit smoking , test satiate , non-smokers test scanner normal condition . This design provide assessment tobacco abstinence alters information processing . Included smoker participant smoke least 10 cigarette per day brand deliver least 0.5 mg nicotine ( FTC method ) least two year afternoon end tidal carbon monoxide ( CO ) concentration least 10 ppm ( confirm inhaler ) . Inclusion criteria non-smoker participant smoke less 50 cigarette lifetime , smoke use nicotine product last 6 month , afternoon end tidal CO le equal 5 ppm . In order reduce variability ensure comparable stimulus exposure , participant require right-handed , least 20-30 corrected vision . During screen session , aspect study described subject inform consent acquire . Breath saliva sample collect order verify smoking status ; paper-and-pencil measure smoke history , nicotine dependence , mood collect . Each subject also complete Brain Imaging Analysis Center ( BIAC ) approve fMRI subject screen form . For female child bear potential , blood sample take pregnancy test . For participant , urine sample take illicit drug test . Finally , subject escort hospital view place mock fMRI scanner short time order increase familiarity study procedure . Subjects meet selection criterion schedule remainder session . Participants learn practice sustain attention task . The plan sustained attention task , call rapid visual information processing task ( RVIP ) require participant identify series three odd three even number among series number present one time computer monitor . A control task participant press button see ' 0 ' also practice . Total task time 15 minute ( practice version ) participant require complete many 8 practice version 50 % accuracy achieve two consecutive attempt . Training may require 2-8 visit exceed 2 hour 40 minute total duration . One practice version task conduct mock fMRI scanner . Following training period , smoker participant complete two fMRI scan non-smokers complete one fMRI scan complete 1 ) undergo five minute rest state BOLD scan , 2 ) two 12.5 minute version RVIP 3 ) 12.5-minute 'cue-viewing ' task view picture people smoke . For 'satiated ' session , smoker participant instruct smoke usual session . For 'abstinent ' session , smoker participant require quit smoke 24 hour prior scan 24 hour follow scan . Quitting verify use CO salivary cotinine nicotine level collect time scan short session 24 hour scan . All smoker participant give information quit smoke 48 hour answer question quit smoking . The order sessions—satiated first vs. abstinent first—will randomly assign . One week second scan , participant attend 30-minute office visit complete questionnaire RVIP task .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. smoked average 10 cigarette per day two year 2. brand delivers ( Federal Trade Commission rat yield ) least 0.5 mg nicotine 3. expire air carbon monoxide read least 10 ppm . 4. general good health 5 . Participants control medical condition ( e.g. , hypertension ) consider treatment thought interfere fMRI measure potentially ameliorate smoke withdrawal symptom 1 . Individuals major medical condition would make participation unsafe ( e.g. , pacemaker metallic implant ) , 2. uncomfortable ( e.g. , chronic pain ) , 3. confound result ( e.g. , psychiatric condition ) 4. suffer claustrophobia ; abnormally afraid closedin place exclude participation , 5 . Current alcohol drug abuse , 6. smokeless tobacco use , use nicotine replacement therapy smoke cessation treatment also basis exclusion evaluate via urine test .</criteria>
