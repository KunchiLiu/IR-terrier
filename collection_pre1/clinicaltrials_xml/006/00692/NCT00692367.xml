	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine effect physical activity patient substantial surgery-induced weight loss . We propose employ randomize controlled physical activity intervention trial group patient undergo bariatric surgery weight loss . The study involve two site active bariatric surgery program , strong track record bariatric surgery research . Recruitment goal 160-200 gastric bypass patient undergo 6 month moderate physical activity compare educational control group engage structure exercise . Subjects include BMI le 55 kg/m2 prior surgery locate relatively close center intervention session . At baseline ( 3 month follow surgery ) 6 month later ( 9 month follow surgery ) , subject CT scan , IV glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) muscle biopsy ( ~8 hour visit ) . They schedule separate visit test physical fitness ( VO2max ) general body composition ( DXA scan ) ( ~2 hour visit ) , 15-min sub-maximal exercise session . 1 . Physical activity group : Subjects progress 4-5 day per week , 30-45 min per session ( 120-180 min per week ) moderate intensity exercise . 2 . Control ( educational ) group : Subjects receive usual care follow surgery include information physical activity . They also ask participate monthly health education session . We promote study one help determine whether physical activity may beneficial addition weight loss . Aim 1 : Insulin resistance metabolic risk factor . Approach : To address Aim 1 , determine 6-month change insulin sensitivity subject 3-month initial weight loss bariatric surgery . As outlined , employ randomize controlled physical activity intervention trial half subject enter physical activity group , half participate monthly health education session ( control ) . By randomize group three month initial weight loss , group begin intervention similar baseline characteristic ( e.g . insulin sensitivity , body weight , physical fitness , etc. ) . We attempt determine effect weight loss per se insulin sensitivity . However , realize amount weight loss could potentially major confound influence detecting change insulin sensitivity two group . Thus , examine degree weight loss covariate analysis . Aim 2 : Intramyocellular lipid body composition . Approach : We examine pre post intervention , change intramyocellular lipid determine percutaneous biopsy , well abdominal intermuscular adipose tissue determine CT image . Aim 3 : Mitochondria content , function fat oxidation . Approach : We use three complimentary measure quantify change oxidative metabolism randomize controlled trial described . All three measure make specific contribution specific aim . Rates rest post-absorptive fat oxidation measure indirect calorimetry . Since skeletal muscle account vast majority energy production physical activity , sub-maximal exercise good model assess skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism . We employ whole body gas exchange indirect calorimetry moderate exercise design elicit high rate fatty acid oxidation . The non-invasive measure systemic fat oxidation rest exercise condition procedure take little time present relatively little burden volunteer technical staff , thus provide efficient mean obtain significant information concern capacity fat oxidation vivo . Muscle biopsy sample obtain trial measure change oxidative capacity ( electron transport chain activity , vitro fatty acid oxidation , muscle fiber type oxidative enzyme ( succinate dehydrogenase ) staining activity muscle .</detailed_description>

Disqualifying finding physical examination include : Lower extremity thrombophlebitis Evidence peripheral neuropathy , paresis edema . If rest EKG prior exercise test show abnormality , test conduct . If abnormality develop test , test stop . On occasion , participant refer PCP evaluation allow continue study write clearance his/her PCP cardiologist . American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) criterion use halt maximal exercise test adverse cardiovascular response develop . Only cardiologist interprets rest exercise ECG participant clear exercise , subject able continue study</criteria>
