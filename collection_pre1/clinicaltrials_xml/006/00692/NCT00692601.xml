	<brief_summary>Capsiate non-pungent analogue capsaicin , component hot pepper make hot spicy . Unlike capsaicin , capsiate spicy hot . Ingestion capsiate show increase rest oxygen consumption , body temperature , burn fat . As , capsiate appear act manner similar many substance energize u , increase alertness cause rush feel affect system body responsible release adrenaline . The major difference , however , capsiate break stomach two component : vanilla fatty acid , absorbed capsiate blood stream . This imply way capsiate work likely act cell gut ( break ) rather affect cell body would end blood . Therefore , gut cell think one responsible trigger full-body adrenaline response . In case , use capsiate show effective preventing weight gain may represent possible therapy treat obesity . Many obesity-related program involve medication advocate use diet and/or exercise . However , one big problem weight loss diet alone general decrease body 's ability burn food eat energy . This problem reason people turn adrenaline-releasing drug like caffeine ephedra . Unfortunately though , much consume , high risk bad side-effects . However , low dose caffeine/ephedra compound ( within specify FDA limit ) recently report effective . Moreover , compound use great frequency people attempt lose weight . Given capsiate increase body temperature , promote burn body fat exceptionally great side-effect profile , look effective supplement use treatment obesity overweight . As , would important test supplement along exercise . This consume capsiate exercise may enhance effectiveness increase burn body fat . The primary purpose study examine response young healthy male 90 minute bout moderate intensity cycling consume 0 mg , 3 mg , 10 mg capsiate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Acute Effects Capsiate During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses Based rationale brief background propose follow substantive hypothesis : 1 . Ingestion capsiate 30min prior exercise elevate rest exercise oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) hierarchical manner : 10 &gt; 3 &gt; 0mg 2 . Respiratory exchange ratio shift toward great lipid oxidation ( i.e. , toward 0.7 ) hierarchical manner : 10 &gt; 3 &gt; 0mg Our secondary hypothesis : - A great rise glycerol FFA rest exercise hierarchical manner : 10 &gt; 3 &gt; 0mg - A great rise catecholamine ( Epinephrine Norepinephrine ) concentration hierarchical manner : 10 &gt; 3 &gt; 0mg Protocol We use double-blind repeated measure study design subject complete 3 trial - 0 , 3 , 10mg - capsiate . Based acute effect see previous study 1 , 4 anticipate sample size 12 subject ( subject male control possible sex-based difference substrate oxidation exercise ) would appear adequate see significant effect capsiate oxygen consumption substrate oxidation . Randomization do counterbalance blocked basis 3 condition 6 possible order combination 12 subject , subject randomize counterbalance manner 2 subject complete trial order . : ABC , ACB , BCA , BAC , CAB , CBA , order treatment assignment perform random complete control McMaster University Pharmacy . The chief pharmacist - Dr. Gita Sobhi - give code treatment PI completion data analysis . We use cycle protocol intensity 55 % subject 's individual peak VO2 90 minute . Workload determine 55 % peak VO2 accord algorithm detail Latin et al . 17 This exercise intensity adequate elevate lipolysis ( i.e. , glycerol FFA ) , catecholamine , show substantial shift RER toward lipid oxidation increase exercise duration . The PI experience protocol measure substrate oxidation previously use similar protocol . 18-20 Moreover , type exercise intensity represent intensity elicits exercise RER around 0.9 thus good blend ( 65:35 carbohydrate : lipid ) fuel oxidize , also intensity close refer 'fatmax ' , define intensity exercise maximal rate lipid oxidation occur . 16 , 21-23 Thus , term select exercise intensity reveal impact capsiate energy expenditure substrate oxidation believe intensity optimal one . We collect breath ( breath-by-breath ensemble average 30 bin ) blood sample 30min recovery ass degree excess post-exercise oxygen consumption elevate whether accompany significant fat oxidation elevate plasma catecholamine . We use recreationally active subject ( peak VO2 &gt; 40 ml/kg/min ) 're assure able complete protocol . Subjects screen use standard health questionnaire ( see attach consent form ) maximal exercise test . Subjects healthy non-smokers age 18-30 recruit local McMaster University campus surround community . Exercise trial take place overnight fast state ( last meal 2000h ) consume standardized diet day prior exercise trial . Having subject fast state present risk barrier subject complete trial base past experience protocol . It emphasize fasted state also easy state interpret data standpoint substrate oxidation . The pre-trial day diet consist energy estimate subject base Harris-Benedict equation 24 activity factor 40 % . The diet 50:30:20 term percent energy carbohydrate : fat : protein . Subjects consume diet day prior exercise trial control pre-study calorie carbohydrate/fat intake , could affect substrate oxidation . Subjects refrain consumption alcohol caffeine day trial . Trials take place least 5d ( 7d ) apart commence time ~7-10am proceed accord schematic timeline show figure 1 . The testing time subject remain consistent throughout study . We also believe prudent subject consume fix constant volume water ( 1000ml ) trial prevent dehydration allow subject complete ride safe manner . All data analyze use repeated measure two-way analysis variance time within factor dose factor . Significant ANOVA effect scrutinize use Tukey 's test post-hoc procedure . Where significant correlation one variable another exist analysis covariance may also perform . Significance accept P &lt; 0.05 . Analysis VO2 RER energy expenditure substrate use - standard equation use revise non-protein RER describe Jeukendrup Wallis . 26 HR - use Polar™ monitor on-line collection via AEI metabolic cart BP - use Finapres™ blood pressure monitoring . Blood glucose , glycerol , lactate - fluorometric method detail Passoneau Lowry 27 perform previously PI . 18 , 20 , 28 Free fatty acid - colorimetric micro-assay method WAKO diagnostics ( http : //www.wakodiagnostics.com/r_nefa.html ) Catecholamines - use reverse phase HPLC electrochemical detection describe previously . 18 , 20</detailed_description>
