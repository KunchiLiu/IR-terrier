	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : To document presence absence proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) high-mobility group-1 protein ( HMG-1 ) serum myocardium child undergo cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) correlate presence absence cytokine clinical outcome CPB BACKGROUND : MIF , 12.5 kD protein discover 1960s substance produce sensitized T lymphocytes involve delayed type hypersensitivity , emerge key cytokine innate immune response infectious inflammatory stimulus . Sources MIF include monocytes/macrophages , anterior pituitary , liver , kidney , spleen , brain . MIF release response various stimulus include lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interferon ( INF ) . Once release , MIF promote secretion proinflammatory mediator macrophages T-cells thus intensify body 's immune response . In addition , MIF unique ability override anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive effect glucocorticoid ( Calandra et al. , Nature Medicine , Feb 2000 ) . MIF combination LPS potentiate lethality murine endotoxemia model , administration anti-MIF antibody increase survival murine sepsis model . ( Calandra et al. , Nature Medicine , Feb 2000 ) . Additionally , MIF knockout mouse model resistant lethal dos LPS ( Bozza et al. , J Exp Med , Jan 1999 ) . HMG-1 , 30kD protein discover 1973 , nonhistone chromatin-associated protein serve DNA bind protein involve nucleosome stabilization , facilitation gene transcription , modulator steroid home receptor activity . More recently HMG-1 implicated monocyte/macrophage derive cytokine serf late mediator endotoxin lethality ( Wang et al. , Science 1999 ) . Murine human macrophages/monocytes release large amount HMG-1 18 hour exposure bacterial endotoxin . Serum HMG-1 level rise 16-36 hour LPS administration murine lethal endotoxemia model . Administration anti-HMG antibody attenuate lethality model even administer 2 hour LPS exposure . Purified rHMG-1 lethal LPS-responsive LPS-resistant mouse . HMG-1 level increase patient sepsis high non-survivors survivor . ( Wang et al. , Science 1999 ) . HMG level also increase patient hemorrhagic shock ( Ombrellino et al. , Lancet 1999 ) . HMG-1 induces TNF release culture human peripheral blood monocyte ( Andersson et al. , J Exp Med , 2000 ) . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) trigger inflammatory state associate endotoxemia cytokine elevation ( Lequier et al. , Chest , Jun 2000 ) . Cytokines know profound effect cardiac function sepsis . Cardiac depression occur commonly CPB may relate cytokine elevation . The role MIF HMG-1 CPB-induced inflammatory state unknown . We demonstrate presence MIF murine heart tissue response LPS currently perform time course study functional assay examine murine cardiac myocyte response MIF stimulus . In order examine clinical relevance laboratory data characterize inflammatory state occur CPB , would like obtain human data correlate MIF level human serum myocardium clinical outcome follow CPB . Additionally , since myocardial depression see CPB occur 12-24 hour CPB suggest late mediator inflammation may important post-CPB myocardial depression , would like assess HMG-1 serum patient undergo CPB correlate presence absence HMG-1 clinical outcome . CONCISE SUMMARY OF PROJECT : We propose study population infant child undergo operative repair congenital heart disease expectation cardiac tissue remove . Patients assessment cardiac function echocardiography well blood assay tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , interleukin-10 , complement 3a , MIF , HMG-1 prior surgery . Cardiac tissue , remove planned part surgical procedure assay MIF well evidence apoptosis , potential mechanism cell death myocardial dysfunction response MIF HMG-1 . The patient monitor PICU number clinical outcome indicator include vital sign , fluid status , inotropic requirement , acid-base status , etc . Blood obtain prior surgery 1 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour post-operatively cytokine assay characterize inflammatory response patient . We determine MIF and/or HMG-1 level correlate clinical outcome . SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL : Blood obtain pre- postoperatively describe . Heart tissue obtain time surgery routine part procedure . The biochemical assay perform sample research purpose . Clinical data obtain routinely record data patient 's electronic PICU chart . RECRIUTMENT OF SUBJECTS : Subjects recruit preoperatively cardiology clinic PICU . Written inform consent obtain parent/legal guardian one study investigator . POTENTIAL RISKS : Study participation pose additional discomfort stress patient/family . Cardiac tissue removal plan portion cardiac surgical repair regardless study participation . Blood sample obtain indwell vascular catheter routinely place prior surgery collect time routine pre post-operative test normally obtain . The amount blood drawn ( ~4cc/sample ) cause hemodynamic compromise result additional blood product replacement . All patient receive quality care monitor PICU regardless study participation . Patients responsible cost generate solely research . SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS : All blood sample obtain sterile fashion . Cardiac tissue obtain operating room routine part surgical procedure . BIOSTATISTICS : A random sample 30 subject select determine whether MIF HMG-1 present cardiac tissue well serum obtain prior follow CPB outline . Descriptive statistic patient demographic plasma tissue concentration indicate cytokine correlate clinical outcome variable .</detailed_description>
