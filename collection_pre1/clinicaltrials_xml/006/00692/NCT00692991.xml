	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) cause narrow blood vessel supply blood oxygen heart . Balloon angioplasty stent placement two treatment option people reduce heart function cause CAD . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedures evaluate heart function time people CAD undergone balloon angioplasty stent placement procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluate Heart Vessel Function After Angioplasty Stent Placement Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAD common type heart disease United States . It occur artery supply blood heart become harden narrowed build-up cholesterol plaque inner wall artery . Over time , less blood able flow artery , deprive heart blood oxygen need . If leave untreated , CAD lead heart failure , heart attack , arrhythmia . Someone plaque build-up may undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) unblock narrow artery increase blood flow . PCI encompass variety procedure , include balloon angioplasty stent placement . In balloon angioplasty , small balloon inserted heart artery inflate . This push plaque artery wall widen artery . Stents wire mesh tube permanently implant artery keep prop open . Although balloon angioplasty stent placement procedure open blockage large vessel heart , tiny vessel heart may become blocked procedure , may affect heart heals . This study use MRI examine heart function people undergo PCI procedure . Study researcher attempt define often blockages tiny vessel occur PCI procedure , factor lead blockage , often blockages affect heal heart . This study enroll people undergo PCI procedure . Participants undergo MRI scan heart PCI procedure . During 72 hour procedure , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) use monitor heart electrical activity . At study visit 10 day PCI procedure follow-up visit 6 12 month later , participant undergo MRI , EKG , blood collection . Study staff call participant every 6 month 5 year collect medical information .</detailed_description>
