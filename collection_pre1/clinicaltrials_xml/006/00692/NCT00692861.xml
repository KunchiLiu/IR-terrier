	<brief_summary>This study , do collaboration Cornell University New York , explore potential role body immune response gluten ataxia . Celiac disease autoimmune disorder trigger ingestion wheat gluten related protein genetically susceptible individual . Some people celiac disease also develop ataxia , loss muscle coordination , lead imbalance . The cause associate ataxia well understood , suspect related immune response towards gluten patient . Preliminary result indicate antibody people celiac disease react brain protein , might role associate neurologic deficit . The aim study characterize immune response ataxia associate celiac disease . People 18 year age old 1 ) ataxia celiac disease , 2 ) ataxia plus celiac disease 3 ) match healthy control subject enrol NIH . People celiac disease enrol Cornell University . All participant blood sample drawn various test immune function well genetic test . Healthy volunteer also history physical examination one do NIH past year . Some patient may require additional clinical evaluation clinical diagnostic reason .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To understand role immune system neurologic complication celiac disease ( CD ) gluten sensitivity ( GS ) . Study population : We plan study 15 patient CD ataxia , 15 patient hereditary ataxia , 30 healthy match control . Design : Four group patient enrol study . The first group consist patient CD ataxia , second group consist CD patient without neurological manifestation , third group consist patient hereditary cerebellar ataxia without CD , final group consist healthy 30 race match volunteer . The second group recruit NIH . Standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) technique use assess presence synapsin I group patient . Using affinity assay , cross-reactivity antibody gliadin synapsin 1 evaluate . Antibody epitope map perform antibody cross-react synapsin 1 gliadin . HLA class II genotypic phenotypic frequency assess compare matched volunteer exploratory measure look genetic risk protective factor group patient . Outcome measure : outcome measure follow : A . To determine whether association antibody reactivity synapsin I neurological deficit CD/GS . B . To characterize cross-reactive antibody patient determine subclass affinity C. To map epitope ( ) synapsin I target patient cross-reactive antibody D. To explore HLA association subset patient CD ataxia</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We plan evaluate serum blood patient gluten sensitivity ( include biopsyproven CD , biopsynegative case high antigliadin antibody titer ) accompany cerebellar ataxia . Serum sample acquire prior initiation glutenfree diet . Therefore , several inclusion criterion exist base study group : INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH CD PLUS CEREBELLAR ATAXIA : The patient meet criteria CD base modify ESPGAN criteria The patient ataxia without neuropathy base clinical evaluation The patient free neurological psychiatric deficit All know cause ataxia rule routine clinical evaluation The patient least 18 year old willing participate protocol The patient take medication commonly know immune modulating effect . The patient gluten free diet INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH HEREDITARY CEREBELLAR ATAXIA WITHOUT CD : The patient test negative serologic marker CD ( i.e . antigliadin , antireticulin , antiendomysial antibody test perform protocol 93N0202 ) The patient ataxia routine clinical examination neurological psychiatric problem The patient know autosomal dominant ataxia ( i.e. , SCA , DRPLA , Friedreich ataxia , etc ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MATCHEDCONTROLS : They CD ataxia base clinical evaluation history Serologic test antigliadin , antireticulin , antiendomysial antibody reveal negative result They race agematched patient CD ataxia group . They neurological psychiatric condition base clinical evaluation history They rheumatological autoimmune condition first degree relative . They least 18 year age able provide consent participation They immune modulate medication . Final diagnosis CD strictly follow modify criterion European Society Pediatric Gastroenterology Nutrition ( ESPGAN ) recommendation recently hold National Institutes Health Consensus Development Conference Celiac Disease . Assessment diagnosis cerebellar ataxia make magnetic resonance imaging brain , clinical examination genetic test spinocerebellar ataxia Friedreich ataxia . Additional routine test do necessary exclude cause . Healthy disease control group evaluate CD neurological deficit . Only symptomfree , antibodynegative individual recruit control group . Exclusion neurological deficit psychiatric illness healthy disease control subject history neurological examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For group , neurological psychiatric diagnosis present , individual qualify participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL GROUPS : Subject already glutenrestricted diet . Is take know immune modulate therapy Have neurological condition ( except neuropathy ) psychiatric condition Not willing blood drawn Is know immune dysfunction Being pregnant lead numerous physiological change . It unclear antibody characteristic influence change .</criteria>
