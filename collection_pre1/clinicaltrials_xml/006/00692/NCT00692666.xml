The drug use adjuvant treatment obesity 1990 2002 withdrawn market manufacturer . The basis number spontaneous report patient die treatment Letigen® . The causal relation never address . There sparse data randomise study above-mentioned report conclusive . We propose control study base data Statistics Denmark hold complete copy Prescription Register Danish Medicines Agency Danish Hospital Discharge Register . The aim study would determine whether excess frequency death serious cardiovascular event explain particular characteristic user drug .

Thus , uncritical comparison user non-users Letigen® regard serious cardiovascular event probably show excess frequency necessarily attribute drug . This problem address special epidemiological technique - case-crossover design - particularly robust comparability problem . In brief , case include . Controls person earlier time , , case-defining disease yet develop . The exposure case compare exposure person ' case history . To account effect chronic exposure , also perform , secondary analysis , conventional case-control study nest within cohort Letigen user , employ risk-set sampling technique .</brief_summary>
