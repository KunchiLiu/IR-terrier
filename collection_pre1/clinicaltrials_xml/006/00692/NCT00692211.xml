We compare proportion subject undergo colorectal cancer screen 3-month study period randomly-selected sample 400 eligible patient require clinic visit initiate screening . Because adherence fecal occult blood test low , also propose evaluate new screen technology -- fecal immunochemical stool test target intact human hemoglobin . These test perform without require patient follow onerous dietary medication restriction . We evaluate whether screen adherence ( proportion complete test ) high fecal immunochemical testing ( n = 400 ) compare standard fecal occult blood test ( n=400 ) .
