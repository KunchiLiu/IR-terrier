	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease consider immune-mediated disease intestinal tract , typically treat use immune modulate immune suppressive therapy . These treatment include local anti-inflammatory agent 5 aminosalicylic acid product , broad immune suppression use corticosteroid , azathioprine , methotrexate ; cytokine suppression antibody TNFα ; IL-12 antibiotic ciprofloxacin metronidazole work decrease putative antigen exposure intestine . There little literature available mortality data relate Crohn 's Disease , one series Farmer et al show 6 % mortality attributable Crohn 's disease . The mortality rate selective patient refractory severe disease probably higher . This protocol base premise sustain inflammation GI tract characteristic Crohn 's disease result defective mucosal T cell tolerance . The mucosal tolerance normally maintain CD4 + T cell characterize T helper 3 ( Th3 ) T regulatory 1 ( TR1 ) T cell clone produce TGFβ IL-10 respectively . There much speculation possible infectious etiology IBD implicate primarily mycobacterial organism , though despite extensive research pathogenic organism definitively identify . In genetic cytokine knockout animal model IBD , typical nonpathogenic enteric flora sufficient induce chronic inflammatory reaction . Autoreactive T cell appear break mucosal tolerance characteristic T helper 1 cytokine profile secrete IL-1 IFNγ . In theory efficient approach eradicate autoimmune T cell clone replacement defective immune system hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) healthy allogeneic donor . However , risk morbidity mortality associate allogeneic HSC transplantation currently appear justified even treatment refractory case Crohn 's disease . An alternative approach use autologous HSC potential autoreactive T-cells eliminate , base hypothesis T-cell deplete autologous graft reconstitution normal immunity occur without regeneration autoimmune clone . Pilot trial Crohn 's autoimmune disease confirm validity hypothesis . T-cells CD34 select PBSC product significantly deplete . If active disease recur despite intensive immunoablation , likely either CD34 selection adequately remove cell responsible autoreactive state , emerge genetically predispose immune system re-exposed autoantigens . Unlike allogeneic transplant , autologous transplant approach greatly reduced morbidity mortality due absence graft rejection graft versus host disease reaction . Currently , autologous HSCT demonstrate transplant-related mortality around 5 % transplant acute leukemia .</detailed_description>
