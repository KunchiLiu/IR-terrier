	<brief_title>Pain , Sexual Dysfunction , Depression Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : There currently 500,000 individual end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) United States , 100,000 new patient develop condition annually . Recent estimate suggest 35,000 veteran currently receive chronic hemodialysis . Although life-sustaining , hemodialysis associate substantial morbidity mortality . Numerous study seek identify intervention reduce mortality patient dependent hemodialysis , yet recent clinical trial dialysis dose , dialysis membrane , lipid lower therapy fail demonstrate survival benefit . With recognition provider limit mean beyond renal transplantation prolong live patient hemodialysis , investigator begin refocus research effort identify intervention improve patient ' quality life , substantially impaired population . Several major factor contribute poor quality life identify , include large burden physical emotional symptom patient population . Of many symptom affect patient hemodialysis , pain , sexual dysfunction , depression among prevalent , severe , highly correlate impaired quality life . These observation particularly noteworthy recent data document safety efficacy pharmacologic therapy symptom . Nonetheless , preliminary study suggest even severe , symptom untreated under-treated patient hemodialysis . The reason sub-optimal treatment clearly elucidate , investigator research demonstrate renal provider largely unaware presence severity pain , sexual dysfunction , depression hemodialysis patient . Although increase provider awareness symptom would seem important provision therapy , clear simply inform clinician would sufficient improve treatment . The broad objective 3-year project determine effective strategy management pain , sexual dysfunction , depression patient chronic hemodialysis . The investigator postulate merely informing renal provider patient ' pain , sexual dysfunction , depression provide evidence-based treatment algorithm significantly improve management symptom . Rather , optimal symptom management require assessment treatment symptom dedicate renal symptom management nurse . In randomized clinical trial 350 patient receive hemodialysis 9 dialysis unit , investigator compare two symptom management strategy : ( ) provide feedback patient ' symptom renal provider along evidence-based algorithms treatment ; ( b ) use renal symptom management nurse identify facilitate treatment symptom . This study involve nurse research assistant bring treatment plan algorithms attention renal provider involve treatment research assistant nurse . By determine effective approach management overall pain , sexual dysfunction , depression , investigator hope introduce patient-centered management approach improve quality life patient receive chronic hemodialysis . METHODS : Overview Study Design The investigator propose randomize , clinical trial compare two strategy treatment pain , sexual dysfunction , depression patient chronic hemodialysis . The investigator recruit 315 patient nine local VA non-VA dialysis unit . After enrollment , baseline data collect 289 patient , observation period least 2 month longer 12 month ensue . Pain , sexual dysfunction , depression assess monthly observation period , allow u establish stability symptom study patient obtain valid estimate impact investigator intervention domain . Additionally , quality life , overall symptom burden satisfaction care assess every 3 month . The investigator assessment sexual function focus ED men , decrease libido , arousal , dyspareunia , satisfaction woman . The investigator also conduct monthly assessment patient ' attendance dialysis , compliance treatment duration , emergency room visit , hospitalization . After observational phase , investigator launch 12-month intervention phase compare two intervention . During phase , investigator continue assessment pain , sexual dysfunction , depression , quality life , overall symptom burden satisfaction care . The investigator continue track attendance compliance dialysis , emergency room visit , hospitalization monthly basis . Patients randomize one two study arm day dialysis treatment ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday versus Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday ) . Sites treat patient Monday/Wednesday/Friday dialysis schedule randomize time dialysis shift within day , patient a.m. shift randomized one arm study p.m. shift . One group randomize `` feedback intervention '' renal provider receive data presence severity patient ' pain , sexual dysfunction , depression along algorithms treatment symptom ( For sexual dysfunction , provider receive treatment algorithm ED recommendation refer woman symptom gynecologic care ) . Treatment decision leave discretion provider ( ) . The group renal symptom management nurse ass facilitate treatment pain , sexual dysfunction , depression ( management intervention ) .In arm , treatment sexual dysfunction men focus ED , symptom management nurse facilitate referral woman sexual dysfunction gynecological care give lack pharmacologic therapy . Study Status : Intervention Phase complete , analysis ongoing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Our target population male female hemodialysis patient age 18 year great English speaker . We exclude child comprise minority dialysis population enrollment would require adult decision maker 's consent . We exclude patient significantly cognitively impaired hence , unable comprehend study survey . Cognitive function assess baseline use miniCog , validated measure cognitive capacity use previously , patient score &lt; 3 exclude . Based prior study , estimate approximately 5 % patient exclude base criterion . Similarly , nonEnglish speaker exclude . Finally , patient undergo active workup live donor kidney transplant , and/or consider transfer peritoneal dialysis exclude less likely remain hemodialysis duration study .</criteria>
