	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine best dose combination two approve drug , intravenous topotecan oral erlotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I , Dosage-finding PK Study IV Topotecan Erlotinib With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial include : - To determine maximum tolerated dosage ( MTD ) intravenous topotecan give combination oral erlotinib . - To define dosage-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) combination . - To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters intravenous topotecan without erlotinib The secondary objective include : - To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect topotecan erlotinib combination - To evaluate correlation presence CYP3A4/5 polymorphism topotecan / erlotinib disposition measure frequency MDR1 BCRP peripheral blood sample correlate result topotecan pharmacokinetics - To measure frequency UGT genotypes peripheral blood sample - To evaluate objective response rate use RECIST criterion .</detailed_description>
