	<brief_title>Massage Therapy Study : Massage Therapy Labour Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goal Objectives : The overall purpose project evaluate effectiveness massage therapy provide registered massage therapist manage pain among woman active labour . Specific Aims : Our specific aim randomly assign woman admit hospital active labour receive maximum five hour massage regulate massage therapist usual care order study effect massage therapy pain relief , labour management patient outcomes . Research Questions : We compare among healthy , nulliparous woman experience health pregnancy access massage therapy admission hospital active labour vs. woman receive usual care : - severity quality pain contraction - among woman carry fetus occiput posterior position , severity back pain - length first second stage labour - need use entonox , sterile water injection , intravenous intramuscular narcotic , epidural analgesia - stage labour ( cervical dilatation ) among woman receive epidural analgesia - position occiput onset second stage - mode delivery : spontaneous vaginal , assist ( vacuum/forceps ) , caesarean section - time first breastfeed delivery Hypotheses : We hypothesize healthy woman receive massage therapy active labour : - give cervical dilatation , experience less severe pain contraction - carry fetus occiput posterior position , give cervical dilatation , report le severe back pain - experience shorter first second stage labour - likely request entenox - likely request sterile water injection - likely request intravenous intramuscular narcotic - less likely request epidural analgesia - request epidural analgesia , request later stage ( great cervical dilatation ) labour - The fetal occiput likely anterior vs. posterior onset second stage labour - less likely deliver caesarean section - undertake first breastfeed quickly delivery Design : We propose randomize two-arm unblinded control trial . The treatment condition massage therapy active phase labour register massage therapist . The control condition usual care . The primary outcome cervical dilatation request epidural analgesia . Study sample : Our study sample drawn healthy nulliparous woman experience healthy pregnancy present intrapartum care BC Women 's Hospital . Study Setting : The study take place BC Women 's Hospital Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . BC Women 's academic teaching hospital . It provide primary care woman resident City Vancouver , regional referral care resident Lower Mainland southwest corner province , tertiary referral care entire province . Approximately 7500 take place hospital annually ; 7000 woman reside Vancouver . All woman delivery imminent triaged large assessment room adjacent delivery suite prior admit intrapartum care . Women labour one-to-one care private labour room . They may whomever else want room support . Recruitment : Women approach participation study register , experience obstetrical nurse admission assessment area hospital . At present , service provide Maternal/fetal Medicine Division Department Obstetrics Gynecology , fee . Randomization : Randomization take place immediately obtain write consent . A statistical software package ( SPSS - Statistical Program Social Sciences ) utilize randomly assign sequential number one two treatment arm . Cards number sequentially label treatment allocation . These card place opaque envelope box keep locked cupboard recruitment nurse hold key . Envelopes open sequential order study participant write informed consent obtain . A log book maintain recruitment nurse detail patient approach , decision participate , randomization number , allocation . Protocol : Immediately randomization , recruitment nurse contact massage therapist call mean cell phone . Massage therapist name application agree call study period total cover 7 day per week . The massage therapist leave immediately come provide massage therapy . The massage therapist receive brief report woman 's labour delivery nurse nature woman 's labour point . She explain woman would suggest specific massage technique begin soon woman ready . It note woman may continue use non-invasive pain management modality wish . This pragmatic trial massage therapy see one additional choice woman access addition repertoire choice routinely available . Study Outcomes : Our primary outcome time epidural analgesia respect cervical dilatation . This outcome choose 67 % nulliparous woman institution epidural analgesia association epidural use intrapartum intervention . In current study would like able detect mean decrease cervical dilation time request epidural small 1 cm . In order find decrease 1 cm cervical dilation , clinically important difference , would need 42 study subject per group 80 % power type I error set p =.05 , one side . Since learn previous study 61 % woman meet study inclusion criterion receive epidural prior 10 cm dilatation , know recruit 70 woman per study arm 42 people arm receive epidural .</detailed_description>
