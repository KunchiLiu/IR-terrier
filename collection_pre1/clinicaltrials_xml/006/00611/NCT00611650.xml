	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use Polyphenon E , substance find green tea , may keep cancer form current former smoker bronchial dysplasia . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect well green tea extract work treat current former smoker bronchial dysplasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Green Tea Extract Treating Current Former Smokers With Bronchial Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy safety Polyphenon E , define green tea catechin extract , current former smoker bronchial dysplasia increase inflammatory load measure C-reactive protein . Secondary - To evaluate ability Polyphenon E modulate surrogate endpoint biomarkers oxidation stress , inflammation , aberrant methylation , cell cycle regulation , apoptosis , oncogene/tumor suppressor gene expression , well phase I II enzyme regulation biological sample patient . - To establish library optical coherent tomography ( OCT ) image bronchial epithelium correspond histopathology , nuclear morphometry , biomarker information . - To assess potential OCT non-biopsy method evaluate chemoprevention agent . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify gender . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral Polyphenon E twice daily 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo twice daily 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo standard white-light bronchoscopy fluorescence bronchoscopy optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) baseline 3 month . During procedure , patient evaluate use Onco-LIFE clinical device , digitally record OCT image abnormal area area suspicious intraepithelial neoplasia invasive carcinoma . Once area localize , patient biopsied fluorescence bronchoscopy guidance obtain dysplastic bronchial epithelial tissue normal bronchial mucosa . Biopsy specimen examine immunostaining tissue-based biomarkers ( i.e. , Ki-67 , cleave caspase-3 , p53 , VEGF ) . Patients also undergo oral brushing , bronchial brushing , bronchoalveolar lavage baseline 3 month obtain bronchial epithelial cell differential gene expression methylation biomarker study ( e.g. , cDNA microarray analysis , polymerase chain reaction , northern blotting ) . Cytokines molecular biomarkers ( i.e. , C-reactive protein , surfactant protein D , oxidize glutathione , interleukin [ IL ] -6 , IL-13 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1 level ) measure blood bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample enzyme-linked immunoassay . Plasma EGCG level assess high-performance liquid chromatography . Urine cotinine level exhale carbon monoxide level also assess . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
