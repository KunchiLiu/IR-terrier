	<brief_title>Mechanisms Effect Physical Activity Adaptation High-Fat Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high fat diet link weight gain obesity . An adjustment acute exposure high fat diet abrupt take time . In previous study laboratory , show high level physical activity accelerate adaptation high fat diet increase fat oxidation . In study determine mechanism involve adjustment . Our hypothesis : 1 . High fat diet decrease skeletal muscle glucose metabolism decrease mitochondrial biogenesis upregulation PDK4 downregulation PGC1Î± ; increase physical activity prevent deleterious effect . 2 . A high fat diet increase hepatic skeletal muscle lipid ; increased physical activity prevent deleterious effect . 3 . These effect pronounce individual low mitochondrial content</detailed_description>
