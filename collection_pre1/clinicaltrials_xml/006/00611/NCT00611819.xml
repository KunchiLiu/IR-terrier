	<brief_summary>The rapidly progression disease HIV-HCV co-infected patient justify treatment . Combination Peg interferon Ribavirin best treatment improve compliance treatment . In APRICOT study genotypes 2 3 patient receive 48 week rate end treatment response 64 % sustained virological response ( 24 week end treatment ) 62 % . In mono-infected patient trial show difference sustain virological response 24 48 week treatment , however exit doubt concern different kinetic viral HIV-HCV co-infected patient could relate lost profit shorter duration treatment , 24 week . In study woud like evaluate 24 week treatment HIV-HCV co-infected patient genotype 2 3 rate clearance virus end follow-up period .</brief_summary>
