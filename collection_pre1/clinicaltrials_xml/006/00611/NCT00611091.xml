The specific aim study evaluate , among population old adult discharge hospital , impact enhance discharge information system initiate upon transition ambulatory setting : ( 1 ) rate follow-up outpatient provider within 14 day hospital discharge ; ( 2 ) prevalence appropriate monitoring select high risk medication 30 day time hospital discharge ; ( 3 ) incidence adverse drug event ( ADEs ) 30 day discharge ; ( 4 ) rate emergency department visit hospital readmission within 30 day discharge . A secondary aim study determine cost directly relate development installation HIT-based transitional care intervention . This research allow examination integrate HIT intervention quality follow-up , outpatient clinician workflow , occurrence ADEs , health care utilization gain insight effective use clinical alert coordinate delivery actionable information outpatient clinicians management ambulatory elderly patient subsequent hospital discharge .</brief_summary>
