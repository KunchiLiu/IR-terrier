	<brief_title>Dyspnea Patients With Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis common form chronic fibrosing lung disease see pulmonologists , estimate 128,000 case United States alone . It almost surely disorder related aging , median age time diagnosis approximately 65 year ; IPF almost unheard age 50 . Dyspnea common patient IPF , often primary symptom disease . It tightly link quality life IPF , suggest experience dyspnea wide-ranging clinically-significant consequence . Despite importance , surprisingly little known etiology functional impact dyspnea disease . This research proposal focus define relationship dyspnea comorbidity rate functional decline patient IPF Aim 1 : To determine relationship dyspnea condition present patient IPF . Dyspnea complex symptom , related mechanical cognitive factor . The mechanisms dyspnea IPF remain unknown , several likely contributor IPF non-IPF relate . Although IPF chronic disease elderly , one investigate relationship common geriatric condition dyspnea . It well establish perception dyspnea depend equally factor influence intensity experience breathlessness ( thoracic restriction weakness ) distress intensity produce . Gender , ethnicity , anxiety , pain , depression may contribute distress cause dyspnea ( therefore intensity ) IPF . Aim 2 : To define relationship dyspnea rate functional decline IPF . Numerous study look predictor survival patient IPF , baseline change dyspnea time show significantly associate . The prediction future morbidity , however , largely unstudied . Established marker functional decline geriatric patient include weight loss , decline walk speed 4 meter , onset disability define ability perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) . Dyspnea likely impact patient ' activity level and/or motivation stay active , may contribute worsen functional decline .</detailed_description>
