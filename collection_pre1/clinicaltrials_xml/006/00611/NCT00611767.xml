	<detailed_description>This project explore hypothesis individual family history positive alcohol dependence ( FHP ) ( without current DSM-IV Axis I disorder , except nicotine dependence ) , experience alteration reward `` valence '' ( balance positive negative effect ) GABA-A receptor agonist barbiturate ( thiopental ) compare family history negative ( FHN ) age-matched subject . Further , effect variation gene important regulate brain GABA function may alter component discriminative stimulus effect ethanol . FHP individual define individual least one first-degree relative another first- second-degree relative . Preliminary result suggest FHP individual show attenuate response thiopental measure descend limb BAES thiopental infusion relative FHN group . Further , preliminary result suggest variation gene involve brain GABA function , glutamate decarboxylase-65 ( GAD65 ) , may influence risk alcoholism alter component discriminative stimulus effect ethanol . We plan recruit 2 group healthy subject age 21-30 , one family history alcoholism ( family history positive=FHP ) sex-matched control group without family history alcoholism ( family history negative=FHN ) , undergo two test day schedule 3 day apart , randomize double-blind fashion . Test day involve 60-minute intravenous infusion 2 condition : saline thiopental , randomize order double-blind condition . Behavioral rating include Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ( BAES ) Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) . Exploratory measure include event-related potential recording ( ERP ) measure eye-to-hand coordination . Blood collect Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) extraction genotyping .</detailed_description>
