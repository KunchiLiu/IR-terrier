	<brief_summary>Delirium rather common among patient Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) , little known incidence ventilator-dependent patient transfer Weaning Center ( WC ) , phase clinical stability . We prospectively evaluate presence delirium ventilator-dependent patient admit WC period two year . They monitor use Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) , previously validate ICU set . This evaluation base score base 8 item obtain simple examination attend physician . The final sum generates score consider normal ( 0-1 ) , borderline ( 2-3 ) pathologic ( &gt; 4 ) . All patient , except normal score , also evaluate psychiatrist , use Diagnostic Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV ) , consider gold standard . The score assess patient 's admission , mid-hospital stay discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delirium define , accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM IV ) , disturbance consciousness characterize acute onset fluctuate course . This impairment cognitive function , account pre-existing dementia , reduce patient 's ability receive , process recall information main feature inattention , disorganize thinking reduce clarity awareness environment . All patient transfer intensive care unit respiratory wean centre ( RWC ) screen occurrence delirium . Our RWC 7-bed unit locate within respiratory department rehabilitation hospital fully equip invasive non-invasive mechanical ventilation ( MV ) invasive noninvasive cardiorespiratory monitoring . Patients generally transfer unit general surgical ICU weaning MV , case patient already wean , rehabilitation , monitor intensive nursing care . All patient next kin give write informed consent participate study study protocol approve local ethic committee . For assessment delirium use Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) , diagnostic tool already validate intensive care set even mechanically ventilated patient . It base assessment 8 different item deal patient 's mental status : one score 0 1 case , respectively , absence presence item final score resultant sum different item ( see appendix 1 detail ) . The evaluation perform daily basis physician charge ICDSC score rank following way : 0 1 consider normal , 2 3 consider borderline , ( i.e . indicative subsyndromal delirious state ) 4 great consider diagnostic delirium ( 13 ) . In presence score great 1 psychiatrist call consultation diagnostic confirmation . Upon discharge patient RWC score trend drawn every patient use three high score sample phase admission , mid stay discharge . Cases overt delirium ( patient ICDSC score ≥4 ) categorize hyperactive hypoactive , accord currently accept classification . Treatment delirium , properly diagnose , institute accord psychiatist 's prescription . Patient 's data collection include demographic data ( age , gender ) , severity score ( SAPS II ) , reason admission ( i.e . need mechanical ventilation ( MV ) ( NMV ) ) previous episode delirium ( hyperactive form ) occur ICU stay link pre-existing mental disease acquire brain failure vascular , metabolic infectious origin . The Kelly scale use assessment level consciousness : patient consider comatose presence persistent ( &gt; 24 hour ) Kelly score ≥4 . As far use sedative analgesic RWC concern , policy base avoidance continuous infusion regimens limitation use drug know suspected capability induce delirium ; drug prescribe strictly need accord judgement physician duty target treatment specific symptom : pain , anxiety , insomnia etc . Analysis variance repeat measure ( MANOVA ) employ statistical analysis , p value low 0.05 consider threshold value statistical significance .</detailed_description>
