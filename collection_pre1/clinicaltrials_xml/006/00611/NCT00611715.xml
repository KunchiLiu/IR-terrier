	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving letrozole together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II clinical trial study well give letrozole together erlotinib work treat postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Letrozole + OSI-774 ( Tarceva ) Post-menopausal , w/ ER and/or PR-positive Met Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine rate clinical benefit ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] patient hormone-dependent locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer treat letrozole combination erlotinib hydrochloride . Secondary - To determine time progression ( TTP ) patient treat regimen . - To evaluate anti-tumor activity , determine CR PR rate , regimen patient . - To evaluate safety regimen patient . - To determine tumor positive epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) Ser118 ER , overexpress human epidermal receptor ( HER2 ) exhibit longer TTP combination compare tumor express overexpress molecule . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior hormone therapy ( hormone-therapy naive/first-line therapy v prior hormonal therapy either tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor adjuvant metastatic setting/second-line therapy ) Patients receive oral letrozole oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
