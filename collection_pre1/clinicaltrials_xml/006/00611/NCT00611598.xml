	<brief_summary>The purpose study help u good understand cellular change may lead development lung cancer . We want compare people second primary lung cancer first primary lung cancer . We hope use information obtain study basis future study regard result study final . We analyze blood cell DNA measure change several gene believe may involve lung cancer . We also want evaluate capacity DNA repair .</brief_summary>
