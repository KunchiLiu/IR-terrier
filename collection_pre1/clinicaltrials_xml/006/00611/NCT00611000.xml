	<brief_title>Effect Folate DNA Colon Tissue Blood Samples From Patients Increased Risk Developing Colorectal Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To analyze effect change level dietary folate intake damage DNA repair capacity , mRNA expression , DNA uracil incorporation peripheral blood mononuclear cell rectal biopsy cell sample patient increase risk develop colorectal neoplasia . OUTLINE : Patients enrol 1 2 intervention groups.. - Group I ( folate depletion [ in-patient ] ) : Patients consume weight-maintaining , average folate diet high folate-containing food 8 week . Patients admit The Rockefeller University Hospital place weight-maintaining , low-folate diet 12 week . During last 4 week in-patient period , patient receive oral folic acid supplementation daily 4 week . - Group II ( folate supplementation [ out-patient ] ) : Patients consume weight-maintaining , average folate diet high folate-containing food 16 week out-patient . After first 8 week diet , patient also receive oral folic acid supplementation daily 8 week . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically biomarker correlative study . Samples analyze serum red cell folate homocystine level assess folate depletion ; methylentetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) polymorphism test inherit alteration folate metabolism ; serum plasma biomarkers ; DNA study . Patients also undergo tissue sample collection sigmoidoscopy rectal biopsy periodically . Tissue sample assess mucosal folate concentration mucosal folic acid metabolite ; DNA methylation ; gene assay microarray analysis . After completion study intervention , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
