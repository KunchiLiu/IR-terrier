	<brief_summary>In phase I study , investigator determine maximum tolerated dos imatinib PTK/ZK administer two different dose schedule . Due different mechanism action minimally-overlapping toxicity profile two novel oral agent , hop combination regimen incorporate compound produce increased activity without enhanced toxicity . After completion phase I study , investigator propose follow-up phase II study patient previously treat metastatic renal cell cancer - VEGF PDGF appear play important role malignant phenotype - determine antitumor efficacy recommend dose combination regimen .</brief_summary>

Adequate end organ function , define follow : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN , ANC &gt; 1500/µL , platelet &gt; 100,000/µL . 7 . Serum bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x institutional upperlimit normal alkaline phosphatase , AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 x institutional upperlimit normal ( within 7 day prior initial treatment ) . 8 . Hemoglobin &gt; = 9 gm/dL ( may transfuse receive erythropoietin maintain exceed level ) . 9 . Patients history brain metastasis eligible , previous treatment metastasis inactive asymptomatic time enrollment study . 10 . Patients must able understand nature study give write informed consent . 11 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day initiation study drug dosing . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Male female patient reproductive potential must agree employ effective barrier method birth control throughout study 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . Oral , injectable , injection contraceptive consider effective may affect cytochrome P450 interaction . 12 . Must evaluabledisease 13 . Must &gt; 18 year age . 14 . Patients may receive prior systemic chemotherapy , i.e . limit number prior regimen patient may receive . 1 . Female patient pregnant lactate . 2 . History acute myocardial infarction within 6 month . In addition , patient ineligible clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g . uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina ) , New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , &gt; grade II peripheral vascular disease . 3 . Patients prior malignancy ( except adequately treat basalcell squamouscell skin cancer , situ carcinoma , low grade [ Gleason score 3+3 less ] localized prostate cancer ) past 5 year exclude . 4 . Patients active concurrent infection patient serious underlying medical condition exclude study . 5 . Women pregnant lactate ineligible .

Patients grade 3 thromboembolic event ineligible unless inrange INR ( usually 2 3 ) stable dose low molecular weight heparin unfractionated heparin . In addition , patient clinical radiologic evidence clot renal vein , inferior vena cava , hepatic vein , portal vein ineligible . Since warfarin metabolize CYP450 system , therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin ( e.g . Coumadin Coumadine ) permit patient participate study . As alternative , therapeutic anticoagulation may accomplish use lowmolecular weight heparin ( e.g . Lovenox ) heparin .
