	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives To determine maxi tolerate dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity SU011248 + Irinotecan recurrent MG pts EIAEDs To characterize safety &amp; tolerability SU011248 + Irinotecan among pt w recurrent MG Secondary Objectives To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile SU011248 &amp; Irinotecan co-administered pt w MG To evaluate anti-tumor activity SU011248 + Irinotecan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I SU011248 + Irinotecan Treatment Pts w MG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary interest combine SU011248 w irinotecan malignant glioma pt derive dramatic anti-tumor activity recently demonstrate among RMG pt treat w humanize anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , combine w irinotecan . 63 percent radiographic response rate observe follow treatment w regimen every wk , &amp; median progression-free survival 23wks . Similar enhancement chemo activity VEGF-directed therapy w bev previously demonstrate colorectal &amp; lung cancer pt . SU011248 evaluate current regimen may exert potent anti-angiogenic effect bev among MG pt due ability inhibit PDGFR-mediated pericyte stabilization tumor neovasculature . Current propose ph I study design determine MTD &amp; DLT SU011248 combo w irinotecan pt w RMG . Both SU01148 &amp; irinotecan know metabolized CYP3A4 cytochrome system . Current study limit enrollment pts CYP3A4-enzyme induce anti-epileptic drug .</detailed_description>
