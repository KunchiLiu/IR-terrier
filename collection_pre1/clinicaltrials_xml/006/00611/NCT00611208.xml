	<brief_summary>This Phase II clinical trial aim treat subgroup patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . The drug consist toxin , call diphtheria toxin , attach antibody specifically target cancerous T-cells . Our primary objective , therefore , determine patient subgroup respect disease burden best responds experimental drug treat CD3 positive T cell malignancy . We determine patient disease respond research agent . The Clinical Response Data analysis October 2014 do completion Phase I portion A-dmT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) fusion protein clinical trial show 25 evaluable patient receive 8 dos vary 2.5 11.25 µg/kg per dose . There responses low dose level 7.5 µg/kg per dose . The overall response rate 36 % complete response rate 16 % ( followed 6 month ) . We identify subgroup CTCL patient high response rate . If exclude patient whose mSWAT score never exceed 50 ( 50 % skin surface area time multiplier ) never lymph node involvement stage III disease leave 9 patient . This subgroup overall response rate 89 % complete response rate 50 % ( followed 6 month ) . Of 4 patient currently complete remission , three long-term responder . Two 6 year duration one 5 year duration . These may represent cure . The long time period transition partial response complete response without treatment , 6 month two year , suggest study drug addition exert direct kill effect tumor also function immunomodulator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate clinical response include response rate duration correlate patient disease stage , tumor burden , anti-DT titer degree T cell depletion induce A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) fusion protein patient surface CD3+ malignant disease . The secondary objective explore toxicity profile A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) fusion protein high-response subgroup patient CTCL whose disease stage progress beyond stage IB/IIB mSWAT &lt; 50 % . Patients receive full supportive care include transfusion irradiate wash blood blood product , antibiotic , antiemetic , etc , appropriate . However , anti-neoplastic drug hematopoietic growth factor ( e.g. , erythropoietin , interleukin-11 , G-CSF GM-CSF ) allow . Treatment consist one 4 day cycle consist 2 daily infusion total 8 treatment give outpatient basis . Patients monitor day 14 sign late drug toxicity daily phone call health care provider . Subjects instructed monitor blood pressure home encourage measure chart daily weight report health care provider . Off-treatment follow-up base upon response . Patients experience partial complete remission later relapse receive radiation treatment new lesion remain study course typical response immunomodulating drug . Patients follow-up visit test day 37 . Patients partial complete remission another follow-up visit day 60 , every three month 1 year , follow annual visit assess duration response . To accommodate patient , offer travel reimbursement program . Due 4 day consecutive infusion , reimburse expense patient would incur travel participate institution treatment . Objectives : 1 . Evaluate overall clinical response include response rate duration large group CTCL high-response patient see high current therapy ( &gt; 49 % ) . 2 . Determine complete response rate duration response A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) fusion protein large group CTCL high-response patient see high current therapy ( &gt; 20 % ) . 3 . Further define toxicity A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) regimen patient CTCL select free preexist cardiac disease never treat Campath . 4 . Determine correlation exist disease stage , tumor burden , anti-DT titer degree T cell depletion response rate response duration .</detailed_description>
