	<brief_summary>We conduct clinical research trial determine role self-managed walking therapy improve walk ability patient diabetes mellitus peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . PAD , commonly refer poor circulation leg , common disease patient diabetes mellitus . For patient PAD , significant risk poor walk ability limb loss . One major treatment PAD walk therapy traditional method delivery treatment require frequent visit university hospital-based site . We address role self-managed walk program , conduct near home , improve limb function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) prevalent illness affect 12 % U.S adult . Diabetes mellitus one strong atherosclerotic risk factor disease . Among patient diabetes mellitus , prevalence PAD high 29 % . An underutilized component care PAD walk therapy . Walking specifically show improve functional status patient PAD leg symptom . Leg symptoms PAD include intermittent claudication atypical leg symptom ( leg discomfort intermittent claudication ) . Patients symptomatic PAD impair low extremity functioning , clinically manifest slow walk speed , reduce walk distance , low physical activity level . These functional deficit often hinder ability live independently community ( e.g. , walk bus stop time next bus , shop independently grocery ) . Reduced physical activity associate increase risk mobility loss high risk functional decline subsequent inability perform activity daily live . Walking therapy burden something patient routinely perform without need regular supervision , treadmill , report hospital ( i.e. , self-managed walk therapy ) . As patient diabetes mellitus special need self-management behavior ( e.g. , diet , medication adherence ) , PAD , high burden atypical leg symptom , role self-managed walk program specific group PAD patient overemphasize . Thus , clinical trial 2 novel aspect : 1 ) evaluate role self-managed walk therapy patient symptomatic PAD 2 ) focus patient PAD diabetes mellitus .</detailed_description>
