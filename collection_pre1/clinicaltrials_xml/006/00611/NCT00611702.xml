	<brief_summary>Doctors success prevent certain type kidney transplant rejection suppress immune system . However , individual 's genetic make-up strength immune response transplant may also determine whether transplanted organ reject . The purpose study look genetic profile immune response people kidney transplant correlate finding kidney transplant rejection episode . Donor genetic profile also study correlated recipient 's information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomics Chronic Renal Allograft Rejection ( The GoCAR Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New immunosuppressive drug improve short-term transplant survival affect long-term transplant survival . Rejection cause immunological non-immunological factor donor recipient . Although exact cause chronic rejection know , associate presence C4d , degradation product antibody response cascade , presence circulate donor-specific antibody ( DSAs ) . The purpose study determine role cell- antibody-mediated response chronic rejection transplant , determine gene expression profile associate development chronic rejection , determine whether variant specific gene cause susceptibility rejection . This observational study people receive kidney transplant participant follow 2 year . Study visit kidney transplant recipient occur study entry month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 transplant . At visit , adverse event assessment , rejection assessment , medication history questionnaire , blood collection occur . At visit , physical exam kidney biopsy occur . Blood also collect live kidney donor time donation donor recipient agree study . This study take place 4 clinical site : Mount Sinai School Medicine , University Wisconsin-Madison , Westmead Hospital , Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Brigham Women 's Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital also participate study central laboratory .</detailed_description>
