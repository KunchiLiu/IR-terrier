	<brief_summary>Evaluating novel MR image technique volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectroscopy High Field</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study twofold . The first aim evaluate new MRI technique develop investigator protocol human volunteer . The second aim assist investigator need use MR image obtain device research . MR image and/or spectroscopy data acquire participant protocol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy normal volunteer image protocol optimization . Patients implanted surgical clip ( hemostatic clip ) ferromagnetic material , Patients engage occupation activity may cause accidental lodge ferromagnetic material , may imbed metal fragment military activity , Patients permanent ( tattoo ) eyeliner facial makeup ( severe eye irritation report ) , Patients compromise thermoregulatory system ( e.g . certain cancer patient ) , Patients metallic implant , may cause artifact diagnostic image due magnetic field distortion , Patients implant prosthetic heart valve , Patients pacemaker , neurostimulation device , Pregnant patient ( safety magnetic resonance examination completely establish embryos fetus ) , Subjects receive orthodontic work involve ferromagnetic material , Subjects claustrophobia , The patient unwilling participate study fail sign consent form . Subjects pregnant breastfeeding exclude contrast enhance MRI study . Subjects allergic response contrast agent previously exclude contrast enhance MRI study . Subjects know history asthma , allergic condition , severe renal insufficiency , sickle cell anemia , chronic hemolytic anemia , gastrointestinal disorder also exclude contrast enhance MRI study .</criteria>
