	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together chemotherapy may effective treatment colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect vaccine therapy give together cyclophosphamide treat patient undergone surgery liver metastasis due metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Liver Metastases Due Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety feasibility vaccination two irradiated allogeneic colorectal carcinoma cell administer GM-K562 cell vaccine sequence immunomodulatory dose cyclophosphamide . Secondary - To evaluate feasibility measure T-cell response Ep-CAM potential surrogate target vaccine-induced immune response . - To assess efficacy , disease-free , overall survival vaccinate patient . OUTLINE : At least 1 month 3 month last course adjuvant systemic chemotherapy hepatic metastectomy , patient receive cyclophosphamide IV day -1 vaccine therapy comprise allogeneic colorectal carcinoma cell K562/GM-CSF cell intradermally day 0 . Treatment repeat every month 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect prior first vaccine administration , one month ( 1st 4th ) immunization correlative study . Samples analyze ELISPOT assay peripheral blood mononuclear cell , HLA type HLA-A2 expression standard NIH microlymphocytotoxicity test , peptide ELISPOT assay , immunologic response exploratory assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
