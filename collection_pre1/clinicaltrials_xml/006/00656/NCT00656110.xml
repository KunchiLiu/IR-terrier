	<brief_title>Neuroma Injections Treat Restless Legs Syndrome - RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) medical condition almost irresistible urge move legs response uncomfortable , difficult-to-describe leg sensation usually worse even especially noticeable inactive sit chair watch TV rest bed try go sleep back sleep awakening . Most patient RLS , asleep , also involuntary leg movement call periodic limb movement sleep ( PLMS ) . During sleep study , brain wave monitoring patient RLS/PLMS often show nighttime leg movement associate brain stimulation arousal light stage sleep . When many brain arousal happen night , natural pattern deep sleep may severely disrupt . Such disturbed sleep poor quality less refreshing . The combination RLS-related delay initiation resumption sleep PLMS-related poor quality sleep may result severe sleep disorder manifest morning sluggishness increase daytime fatigue . The cause ( ) RLS PLMS determine . Neurologists believe originate brain area control movement may relate localize low level dopamine ( chemical messenger nerve cell ) relate disordered brain iron metabolism , theory never proven . RLS PLMS generally lifelong condition cure . RLS treat medication target brain category drug use treat symptom ( vary success ) include mainly dopaminergic drug also sedatives , anti-seizure drug , pain medication narcotic . Two dopaminergic drug approve FDA treatment RLS : ropinirole ( `` Requip '' ) 2005 pramipexole ( `` Mirapex '' ) 2006 . However drug far ideal , addition problem side effect , patient may respond drug symptom may partially improve . Also , improvement occur continue take drug , finally , symptom may sometimes become much bad initial period improvement , phenomenon call augmentation . Foot neuromas nerve entrapment ( `` pinch nerve '' ) form point common interdigital nerve must stretch ligament metatarsal head ball foot . Repeated irritation damage nerve stretch point eventually result fibrous thicken enlargement nerve tissue lump call neuroma . This commonly involve nerve ball foot third fourth toe ( `` Morton 's Neuroma '' ) , neuromas also often form entrapment/stretch point nerve second/third fourth/fifth toe . Neuromas may completely asymptomatic foot may cause variable degree unilateral bilateral foot pain numbness bring make worse tight shoe , high heel , prolong walk standing . When neuromas become severely symptomatic , may cause neuropathic symptom burn , tingle , numbness , electric shock shooting pain , hypersensitivity . Neuromas treat series injection ( local anesthetic combine either steroid and/or alcohol solution ) give neuroma-containing space ball foot . It believe injection serve calm nerve irritability usually result improvement sometimes even complete resolution neuropathic symptom ( burn pain , etc. ) . Previous study group determine many patient neuropathic foot symptom ( burn , tingle , electric shock , numbness , etc . ) previously diagnose `` peripheral neuropathy , '' actually neuromas foot cause symptom . The causative role neuroma patient demonstrate fact chronic pain symptom improve ( case markedly ) standard neuroma injection treatment . In addition improvement neuropathic foot pain , many patient also report sleep much good . Such patient report decrease RLS-type leg restlessness also spouse noted decrease PLMS-type nighttime leg movement , direct result bilateral neuroma injection . These report prompt study patient RLS/PLMS without neuropathic foot pain . Most patient RLS/PLMS major foot complaint . However patient consistently find u physical evidence neuromas examination foot standard treatment bilateral neuroma usually result prompt improvement symptom related RLS/PLMS along quality sleep . 15 patient study intensively neuroma treatment 9 patient complete relief RLS symptom average 2 month series neuroma injection ( Lettau LA , Gudas CJ . Bilateral Morton 's neuromas etiology restless legs syndrome . J SC Med Assoc 2005 ; 101 : e341-e347 ) . However , prevail theory remain RLS brain origin , control study do support foot neuroma origin RLS compare response two randomized group adult RLS - one group receive series 3 bilateral neuroma treatment ( equal part 0.5 % plain Marcaine 2 % lidocaine mixed 0.8 mg Depo-medrol/4 % absolute alcohol total injection volume 1 ml inject weekly 3 week ) second `` control '' group receive placebo ( normal saline ) injection similar time period . Neither group tell whether get actual treatment solution placebo 3 week . After 3 week , patient receive placebo , tell status give real injection treatment next 3 week . One follow-up visit ( 4 week last treatment injection ) plan assess short term duration treatment ( ) .</detailed_description>
