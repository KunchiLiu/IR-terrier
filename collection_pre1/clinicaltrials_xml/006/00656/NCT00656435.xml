	<brief_summary>Persistent recurrent vitreous hemorrhage vitrectomy diabetic retinopathy complication common occurrence incidence 12 % 63 % . This complication may prolong vitreous clear-up delay visual rehabilitation significantly , sometimes require additional procedure surgery . The cause bleed diverse . Evidence suggest fibrovascular proliferation sclerotomy sit vitreous base may important source recurrent vitreous hemorrhage ; source bleed include iatrogenic intraoperative injury retinal vessel , incomplete removal fibrovascular tissue . We report possible benefit peripheral retinal cryotherapy cryotherapy treatment sclerotomy sit prevent delayed-onset recurrent vitreous hemorrhage , possible benefit intravitreal long-acting gas reduce occurrence early postoperative recurrent vitreous hemorrhage , especially case active fibrovascular proliferation . However , minor recurrent vitreous hemorrhage prolong reabsorption lysed blood clot surgical trauma remain important factor cause medium opacity long enough prevent quick visual rehabilitation . Intravitreal bevacizumab note induce rapid regression retinal iris neovascularization proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Further , presurgical administration intravitreal bevacizumab may reduce intraoperative bleeding membrane dissection PDR traction retinal detachment . We hypothesize presurgical treatment intravitreal bevacizumab may reduce intraoperative bleeding amount residual blood clot , intraoperative infusion long-acting gas may facilitate post-operative recovery surgically injured retinal vessel . These combined effect would thus enhance early clear-up vitreous opacity clot lysis recurrent retinal bleeding . To investigate hypothesis , clinical prospective study undertaken evaluate effect bevacizumab pretreatment combine intravitreal infusion long-acting gas clearance speed recurrence rate early postoperative vitreous hemorrhage vitrectomy active diabetic fibrovascular proliferation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From December 2006 August 2007 , consecutive patient undergo primary par plana vitrectomy active proliferative diabetic retinopathy recruit prospective study . Included case active fibrovascular proliferation vitreo-retinal adhesion 3 site extend beyond equator one quadrant . Active fibrovascular proliferation define visible new vessel within proliferative membrane degree fresh vitreous preretinal hemorrhage . Exclusion criterion : 1 . History preoperative postoperative anticoagulant therapy ; 2 . History blood disease associate abnormal coagulation ; 3 . Severe proliferation anticipation silicone oil usage . Informed consent obtain every patient surgery . The protocol approve review board research ethic committee National Taiwan University Hospital . All case study group prospectively enrol ( group 1 ) . Consecutive patient fulfil enrollment criterion receive intravitreal bevacizumab ( 1.25mg 0.05ml ) injection 7 9 day surgery intravitreal 10 % C3F8 infusion end surgery . The surgical outcome compare non-concurrent control group receive gas infusion ( group2 ) . The control group match baseline characteristic severity diabetic proliferation study group . The comparison two group possible relevant parameter carefully document control group . A single surgeon ( CMY ) perform operation . Operative Technique For intravitreal bevacizumab injection , topical anesthesia , patient disinfect three time povidone-iodine solution drape . After eyelid speculum put place , eye anesthetize proparacaine -soaked cotton-tip applicator . Bevacizumab ( 1.25mg 0.05ml ) drawn 1 ml syringe 27-gauged needle newly open vial injected 30-gauged needle vitreous cavity via temporal low par plana . Anterior chamber paracentesis perform . Standard 3-port par plana vitrectomy describe previously do every case . In short , vitreoretinal traction , fibrovascular tissue , opacified vitreous well blood clot adherent peripheral vitreous skirt remove completely safely possible . Hemostasis obtain raise infusion bottle , mechanical compression use soft-tipped cannula , endodiathermy , combination technique . Blood clot form tissue dissection remove carefully except bleed site trim small island . Panretinal photocoagulation non-laser treated eye supplementary laser previously laser-treated eye extend beyond level equator perform . Further peripheral retinal cryotherapy ( 10 12 spot one row ) do . 10 % C3F8 intravitreal infusion do case wound closure . Finally , cryotherapy sclerotomy site ( 1 spot , 6 second , 3 sclerotomy site ) perform . After surgery , patient keep prone position overnight , maintain head-down position waking hour . The patient allow lie either side sleep 3 week thereafter . Ophthalmological examination perform first 4 day surgery , weekly 4 week , biweekly 1 month , monthly least 6 month . The preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative data collect patient . These demographic clinical finding include age , gender , study eye , type , duration treatment regiment diabetes mellitus , systemic disease hypertension , renal insufficiency , intraoperative diagnosis , extent vitreo-retinal adhesion , degree intraoperative bleeding , duration surgery , combine lens extraction . The extent neovascularization , severity retinal traction , amount fresh vitreous hemorrhage one week bevacizumab injection document , possible , photograph . Data regard duration vitreous clear-up ; time , duration , frequency treatment recurrent vitreous hemorrhage ; duration postoperative follow-up also compile . The extent fibrovascular proliferation grade follow : grade 1 , focal adhesion ; grade 2 , broad adhesion ≥ one site ( ) vitreous-retinal adhesion disc , macula , arcade ; grade3 , vitreous-retinal attachment extend periphery . Intraoperative bleeding classify 3 grade : grade 1 , minor bleeding stop either spontaneously transient bottle elevation ; grade 2 , moderate bleeding require endodiathermy formation broad sheet clot extend away bleed site ; grade 3 , thick clot formation cover least half posterior pole interfere surgical plane . Results ophthalmological examination , include best correct visual acuity , intraocular pressure , lens status , intravitreal gas amount , record . We define vitreous clear-up time ( VCUT ) interval end surgery time visualization retinal vessel regain gas bubble . VCUT equal 3 week consider prolonged . We define recurrent vitreous hemorrhage recurrent hemorrhage obscure retinal vessel ( grade 2 Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study14 ) one week VCUT . Both early ( ≤ 4 week ) late ( &gt; 4weeks ) recurrent vitreous hemorrhage record . The severity vitreous hemorrhage classify accord scale define Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study , reconfirm another ophthalmologist every patient . The VCUT , rate treatment recurrent vitreous hemorrhage , change best-corrected visual acuity compare group 1 2 . Visual acuity grade three level : low ( ≤1 meter count finger ) , moderate ( &gt; 1 meter count finger , &lt; 20/200 ) , good ( ≥ 20/200 ) . Statistical Analysis To examine difference among group 1 2 , discrete variable perform statistical analysis chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation Wilcoxon rank sum test perform make comparison among group 1 2 . To verify effect combine bevacizumab gas treatment examine possible factor affect vitreous clear-up time , would perform multivariate logistic regression analysis determine significance follow factor : age , gender , duration diabetes ( &lt; 10 year ≥ 10 year ) , treatment regiment diabetes , prior pan-retinal photocoagulation , hypertension , renal insufficiency , extent fibrovascular proliferation , duration surgery , intravitreal bevacizumab . All statistical analysis perform use STATA 8.2 software ( StataCorp LP , College Station , Texas , USA ) . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
