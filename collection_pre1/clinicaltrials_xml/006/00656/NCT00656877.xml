	<brief_title>Incidence Fat Embolism With Computer Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computer assist total knee arthroplasty inception currently . There many unknown specific technique , particularly come fat embolism syndrome . There high incidence fat embolism total knee arthroplasty see echocariography well sample right atrial blood . During jig-based , traditional , total knee arthroplasty , rod place inside femur , sometimes tibia well . Intrusumentations medullary canal know cause fat embolism . Fat embolism syndrome produce post-operative confusion , hypoxemia , way post-op intra-operative death . Computer assist total knee arthroplasty use intramedullary jig . It presume instrument medullary canal , rate fat embolism significantly reduce . Fifty patient study computer assist total knee arthoplasty . A PICC line place arm interventional radiologist pre-operatively . This PICC line thread right atrium . Right atrial blood send pathology every 10 minute 60 90 minute procedure interval post-op . The right atrial blood stain bone marrow element . This study presume show yet another benefit computer assist surgery .</detailed_description>
