	<brief_title>Effectiveness Efficiency Two Models Delivering Care Chronic Wound Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management chronic wound community press issue home care authority . The care leg ulcer represent considerable expense health care system .

These international study provide optimism reorganization care within Canadian context deliver community service improve outcome . However , rigorous evaluation effectiveness efficiency understand change Canadian context beneficial . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness efficiency two model service delivery : traditional single service delivery model ( home visiting ) compare nurse-led community clinic . Research Questions : 1 .
