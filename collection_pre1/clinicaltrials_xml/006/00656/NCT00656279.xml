	<brief_title>Intensive Dietary Education Lower Serum Phosphorus Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High serum phosphorus concentration ( hPhos ) commonly occur chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) secondary decline renal function . hPhos increase risk develop metastatic calcification , secondary hyperparathyroidism , renal osteodystrophy cardiovascular complication . Patients hPhos advise restrict dietary phosphorus intake 800-1000mg/d , per National Kidney Foundations'Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative ( KDOQI ) . Adherence phosphorus restrict diet often challenge CKD patient , may require follow various dietary restriction , significant quantity hide phosphorus process food . This randomize controlled trial design compare effectiveness intensive phosphorus education ( IPE ) use innovative Phosphorus Point System Tool© versus standard phosphorus education ( SPE ) use Choose/Avoid list 1 ) serum phosphorus level ( primary outcome ) 2 ) dietary adherence , dietary knowledge satisfaction patient pre-dialysis CKD . We hypothesize patient receive IPE low serum phosphorus receive SPE . Fifty patient attend pre-dialysis CKD clinic serum phosphorus &gt; 1.49 mmol/L randomly assign IPE SPE follow 12 week . Serum phosphorus , dietary intake use 5-pass repeat 24-hour dietary recall method , dietary knowledge satisfaction validate questionnaire , measure baseline , 6 week 12 week . The study 's finding impact intensive innovative dietary phosphorus education patient pre-dialysis CKD serve towards develop best practice care potentially reduce long-term complication .</detailed_description>
