	<detailed_description>Background : Bleeding frequent complication surgery . The peri-operative administration blood product , include pack red blood cell , thrombocyte fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , often deem necessary . Beside expense blood product product carry risk infection , allergic reaction immune-modulation . Therefore transfusion allogenic blood product mandate strategy optimize clinical decision transfuse . Bleeding surgery dynamic process ; happen within minute result major blood loss , also coagulation aberration . The indication transfusion base reliable coagulation study . Traditional coagulation study require 1 hour . Therefore , decision administer FFP usually make absence data . Point care test prothrombin time ensure major parameter coagulation readily available operation theatre within 3 minute . It fast , easy perform , inexpensive may enable physician rationally determine need FFP . Objective : To determine effectiveness point care coagulation test prothrombin time reduce administration FFP . Methods : Patient assessor blind , single center randomize controlled parallel group trial 220 patient age 18 90 year undergo major surgery ( type , except cardiac surgery liver transplant ) estimate blood loss surgery exceed 20 % calculate normal total blood volume requirement FFP accord judgment treat surgeon anesthesiologist . Patients randomize usual care plus point care coagulation test usual care alone without point care test . Primary endpoint relative risk receive FFP peri-operatively . Significance : Point care coagulation test operation theatre may reduce administration fresh frozen plasma considerably , turn may decrease cost complication usually associate administration allogenic blood product .</detailed_description>
