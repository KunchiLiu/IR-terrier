	<brief_summary>Incretin hormone hormone produce gut response food intake . These hormone help body control metabolism glucose ( sugar ) . In particular , two incretin hormone ( GLP-1 GIP ) cause pancreas secrete insulin response high blood glucose level . This help body metabolize glucose effectively , lower blood sugar level . GLP-1 GIP work well patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) subject diabetes . This study test whether medicine call pioglitazone ( Actos ) , commonly use treat T2DM , improve ability GIP increase insulin secretion . To address question investigator recruit patient T2DM whose diabetes control either diet exercise metformin ( another medicine commonly use treat T2DM ) . Subjects undergo measurement body fat DEXA scan series study characterize metabolism . These study include oral glucose tolerance test ( test sometimes use diagnose diabetes ) , mixed-meal challenge ( measure much GLP-1 GIP produce response meal ) measurement insulin secretion response glucose GIP give vein . The investigator also obtain small sample fat ( skin belly ) use needle measure level receptor GIP . Subjects randomly assign 12 week treatment either pioglitazone match placebo ( inactive tablet contain medication ) . The dose pioglitazone increase first 4 week maximum prescribe dose 45 mg per day . Subjects see every 2-4 week treatment phase study . After 12 week treatment study perform begin study repeat . The pioglitazone treatment continue end testing , approximately 4 week . The result study may give u information glucose control deteriorate T2DM . This information might also lead new way prevent treat T2DM .</brief_summary>
