	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus 2CdA Patients With Advanced Relapsed Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue ( MALT ) Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , chemotherapeutic standard treatment patient MALT lymphoma either presenting disseminate disease relapsing/refractory disease follow local treatment ( include radiation ) eradication HP . Various compound test , include alkylating agent cyclophosphamide chlorambucil , nucleoside analog cladribine ( 2CdA ) , well combination regimen include CHOP MCP ( mitoxantrone , chlorambucil , prednisone ) , limited data exists prospective trial . Thus , trial evaluate potential new compound patient advance MALT lymphoma justify , seem warrant . While systemic approach recently think justified patient disseminated disease , emerge data suggest also patient localize disease potentially amenable radiation may benefit systemic treatment . This demonstrate ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma recently also gastric MALT lymphoma randomize fashion , application chemotherapy result significantly long time relapse oppose surgery radiation without impair overall survival . Both 2CdA rituximab demonstrate active single agent MALT lymphoma mild toxicity profile data combination therapy rituximab plus chemotherapy MALT lymphoma publish date . This study therefore evaluate efficacy safety Rituximab plus 2CdA patient advance relapsed lymphoma mucose associate lymphoid tissue .</detailed_description>
