	<brief_summary>This study use eye image test call high speed indocyanine green angiography ( HS-ICG ) , examine leaky vessel eye , try find individual respond differently ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) treatment wet age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . The drug recently approve Food Drug Administration treat disease , response treatment varies markedly among individual . People 50 year age old wet AMD vision meet research protocol criterion may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Ranibizumab injection study eye month 4 month . Additional injection give study eye show sign bleed leak fluid . The eye numbed injection eye area clean antiseptic . Antibiotic drop use 3 day follow injection prevent infection . Clinic visit month 2 year evaluation monitor response treatment . The evaluation may include follow examination test : - Eye examination dilation , optical coherence tomography photography : The examination measure visual acuity , thickness retina ( back eye ) andeye pressure . Bright light also use doctor see back eye . Photographs eye may take . - Fluorescein angiography examine blood vessel eye : A dye call fluorescein injected vein arm . The dye travel vein blood vessel eye . A camera take picture dye flow blood vessel . This test do eight time study . - Indocyanine green angiography examine blood vessel eye : The procedure fluorescein angiography , use dye call indocyanine green . This test do month first year study every 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings Ranibizumab Treatment Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness among elderly United States.1 Ranibizumab , inhibitor form vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , first FDA-approved treatment AMD significantly improve vision quarter third patient maintain improves vision great 90 % patient . Ranibizumab decrease vasopermeability measure decreased leakage fluid fluorescein ( FA ) optical coherence tomography . However , effect ranibizumab structure hemodynamics choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) AMD , measure high-speed indocyanine green angiography ( HS-ICG ) , know . The effect lack effect physical structure CNV may help explain variability injection frequency visual response among different patient . Since anti-VEGF therapy design inhibit exudative CNV , clinically important develop standard reproducible method assess HS-ICG . In observational study , primary objective ass whether induction/pro nata ( Induction/PRN ) 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab-based treatment neovascular AMD decrease size pattern CNV measure HS-ICG , oppose simply decrease leakage fluid see FA OCT . Although combination therapy likely standard treatment AMD future , participant allow receive AMD experimental agent ( e.g. , immunosuppressive drug ) either study fellow eye study . In consultation various reading center , attempt develop reproducible schema evaluation HS-ICG review pre-treatment post-treatment HS-ICGs . The grade system development secondary objective achieve good understanding anatomical functional result important task future research . In study , first 10 case use attempt develop reproducible grading system . The NEI retina group review ICGs attempt identify gradable aspect lesion consistently present ICGs . During time continue collect additional case evaluation . The grading system propose first 10 case implement next 10 case . There two independent grading ICG . The result dual grading review problematic area grade identify . The grading system modify base experience reproducibility modify grade system assess re-grading image mask fashion . The modify grading system utilized next 10 case . This iterative process continue either develop reproducible useful grading system complete full participant analysis . Another important secondary objective examine whether increase dose 1 mg intravitreal ranibizumab-based treatment ( administer 1 mg monthly 0.5 mg bi-monthly ) decrease leakage fluid see FA OCT and/or decrease size pattern CNV HS-ICG participant become fluid-free standard dose .</detailed_description>

Acceptable method birth control include hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy tubal ligation ) . The participant must willing able comply protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The participant CNV , associate ocular disease pathologic myopia , ocular histoplasmosis posterior uveitis , etc . The participant geographic atrophy fibrosis fovea prevents visual acuity improvement discretion investigator . The participant decrease vision due retinal disease attributable CNV , nonexudative form AMD , geographic atrophy , inherit retinal dystrophy , uveitis , epiretinal membrane . The participant additional ocular disease irreversibly compromise could likely compromise visual acuity study eye include amblyopia , anterior ischemic optic neuropathy , clinically significant diabetic macular edema , severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy . The participant decrease vision due significant medium opacity corneal disease cataract , opacity preclude photography retina ; tear RPE ; vitelliformlike lesion outer retina ( e.g. , pattern dystrophy basal laminar cuticular drusen ) , idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasis , central serous chorioretinopathy . The participant history treatment CNV study eye focal laser photocoagulation ( subfoveal , juxtafoveal extrafoveal ) , verteporfin/photodynamic therapy , transpupillary thermotherapy , external beam radiation therapy , local treatment ( submacular surgery ) result significant subfoveal atrophy fibrosis determine investigator . The participant previous ranibizumab , bevacizumab pegaptanib sodium treatment study eye less four week prior enrollment . The participant prior verteporfin/photodynamic therapy fellow eye le one week prior enrollment . The participant evidence ocular toxoplasmosis ; external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis ; chalazion ; significant blepharitis ; aphakia study eye .
