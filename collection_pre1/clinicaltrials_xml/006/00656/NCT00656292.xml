	<brief_summary>The purpose present study quantify degree modulation , , perioperative inflammatory response associate statin use . Specifically , hypothesize : In population patient undergo elective orthopedic spine surgery , administration specific statin ( Simvastatin , ZocorÂ® , Merck Pharmaceuticals ) , associate decrease perioperative inflammatory marker compare patient take statin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Role `` Statin '' Therapy Perioperative Inflammatory Response Patients Undergoing Major Orthopedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study report activation body 's immune system perioperative period.1 Typically , `` stress response '' limit go unnoticed patient health care team . However , physiologic insult occur major surgery may elicit pronounced response know systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Such response great clinical consequence , know significantly worsen perioperative morbidity mortality.1 HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors ( hereafter identify common name , `` statin '' ) potent inhibitor cholesterol synthesis , role treatment atherosclerosis prevention coronary artery disease well documented.2-5 Interestingly , data animal study show statin unique anti-inflammatory property independent lipid lower effects.6 Recently , statin therapy associate reduced incidence perioperative cardiovascular neurologic complication major vascular thoracic surgery patient well improve outcome patient experience acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) .7-13 In ACS patient population study , improvement outcome attribute coronary plaque stabilization , presumably result statin mitigate local inflammatory response level coronary plaque . The purpose study quantify magnitude perioperative inflammation major orthopedic spine surgery determine whether statin alter systemic physiologic response .</detailed_description>
