	<brief_title>Inhaled Corticosteroids Versus Observation Patients With Decreased Lung Function Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Fluticasone propionate design stop inflammatory action asthma cell PTCB . Screening Tests : Before start treatment study , pulmonary function test ( PFT ) . For test , ask breathe several different way mouthpiece mouth test lung function . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , participant assign receive fluticasone propionate . Study Drug Administration : You receive fluticasone propionate twice day oral inhalation . The study drug take metered-dose inhaler . You give detailed instruction research nurse clinic nurse first study visit . You use Albuterol MDI ( rescue inhaler ) need shortness breath . This inhaler commonly use treat asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , respiratory problem . Your clinic nurse tell use . You fill diary record often use rescue inhaler . You also record take study drug week . The diary collected visit . The diary take minute fill . Study Visits : On Day 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You 6-minute walk test . To perform 6-minute walk test , walk far possible around cone flat indoor course 40 yard long . You walk pace take breaks time . After 6 minute , study staff check total distance walk . Your vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) measure walk . Your oxygen saturation level check throughout test . To measure oxygen saturation , wear small clip finger send oxygen saturation data small computer . - You also complete St. George 's respiratory questionnaire.The questionnaire 17 multiple choice true/false question lung function overall health . A research nurse available help questionnaire . It take 30 minute complete . - You also complete NIOX flex test . This measure amount nitric oxide lung . While seat , exhale place NIOX filter mouth . You inhale full lung capacity 2-3 second . Then exhale slowly keep constant flow aid meter computer screen . This repeat 3 valid reading measure test complete . Between Weeks 4 6 , PFT . At 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , follow test procedure perform : - You PFT . - You complete St. George 's respiratory questionnaire . - You 6-minute walk test . - You exhale nitric oxide ( NIOX ) Flex test , baseline , 3 6 month . Length Study : You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . All patient whose condition stay improved end 1 year continue study drug visit schedule . End-of-Study Visit : Before consider off-study , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You PFT . - You complete St. George 's respiratory questionnaire . - You 6-minute walk test . Follow-Up : Patients may contact mail phone answer follow-up question . Follow-up question contact frequency base condition . If contact phone , conversation last 15 minute . This investigational study . Fluticasone propionate FDA approve commercially available use asthma COPD patient . It 's use PTCB investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
