	<brief_title>ExAblate ( Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery ) Treatment Metastatic Bone Tumors Palliation Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone third common organ involve metastatic disease behind lung liver [ 7 ] . In breast cancer , bone second common site metastatic spread , approximately 85 % patient die breast cancer bone metastasis . Breast prostate cancer metastasize bone frequently , reflect high incidence tumor , well prolonged clinical course . The increase longevity population couple well therapeutic management cancer patient contribute high incidence prevalence metastatic bone lesion . Pain bone metastasis common cause cancer pain patient live bone metastasis , improve quality life become major challenge . In patient die breast , prostate , lung cancer , autopsy study show 85 % evidence bone metastasis time death [ 7-9 ] . Current treatment patient bone metastasis primarily palliative include localized therapy [ 10 ] , systemic therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiopharmaceutical , bisphosphonates ) , analgesic ( opioids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) . Recently , radiofrequency ablation test treatment option bone metastases [ 11 ] . The main goal treatment improvement quality life functional level . These goal describe : 1 . Pain relief 2 . Preservation restoration function 3 . Local tumor control 4 . Skeletal stabilization Treatment external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) standard care patient localize bone pain , result palliation pain majority patient . More 66 % patient limited number well-localized bony metastasis treat effectively external-beam irradiation . However , approximately 30 % patient treat radiation therapy experience pain relief [ 8 , 12-16 ] . Furthermore , increase risk pathologic fracture peri-irradiation period due induce hyperemic response periphery tumor . This weaken adjacent bone increase risk spontaneous fracture . Adding , patient recurrent pain site previously irradiate may eligible radiation therapy secondary limitation normal tissue tolerance . The speed response radiation therapy varies ; patient respond symptomatic bony metastasis begin respond course 10 14 day , 70 % patient experience pain relief within 2 week start therapy , within 3 month 90 % patient achieve pain relief . Patients , EBRT fail improve , may need seek therapy radio frequency ablation , surgical resection , etc. , less efficient high treatment related morbidity . Because ExAblate system design non-invasively ablate tissue , ExAblate may meet need EBRT fail patient . The ExAblate system potential achieve first three four mention goal , well change treatment limit result morbidity accordance above-mentioned goal [ 17 ] . The palliative effect ExAblate achieve heat bone periosteum , thus ablate sensory origin pain . Based FDA approve phase-1 initial study ( IDE # G050177 ) result result study performed outside United States sponsor do , palliation effect significant term mean improvement , number treat patient report symptomatic improvement potential durability . Based ExAblate treatment potential treatment choice radiation</detailed_description>
