	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find Procrit ( epoetin alfa ) help decrease need blood transfusion patient Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) receive chemotherapy . Researchers also want learn remission rate ( rate recovery ) patient cancer receive treatment epoetin alfa . The safety effectiveness therapy also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Procrit vs. No Procrit AML High Risk MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa medication help body make red blood cell . Researchers want find effective reduce need blood transfusion patient AML high-risk MDS receiving chemotherapy . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . Participants one group give epoetin alfa along blood transfusion , doctor think necessary . Participants group receive epoetin alfa . Instead blood transfusion , standard care . No matter group , receive transfusion hemoglobin ( element red blood cell carry oxygen ) drop certain level doctor think necessary . You ask keep diary listing date transfusion receive . The study doctor monitor hemoglobin level check standard blood test do treat doctor . If hemoglobin rise certain level , treatment epoetin alfa may temporarily stop hemoglobin level decrease . If assign receive epoetin alfa , receive week subcutaneous ( skin ) injection regularly schedule chemotherapy . You receive treatment epoetin alfa 12 week . If experience intolerable side effect disease get bad , take study . Participants group continue receive chemotherapy study regularly schedule . During chemotherapy ( part standard care ) , around 1 tablespoon blood drawn every 1-2 week routine blood test . This investigational study . Epoetin alfa FDA approve commercially available . Up 54 patient take part study . All enrol University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis AML highrisk MDS ( base International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) : refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB ) RAEB transformation [ RAEBt ] ) receive frontline induction chemotherapy high dose conventional dose cytarabinecontaining regimen clofarabinecontaining regimen MD Anderson Cancer Center . Patients must enrol study within two week start induction chemotherapy . Patients document iron , vitamin B12 , folate deficiency eligible , receive replacement therapy study . Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Patients prior treatment form erythropoietin within previous month . Patients uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; =140/90 ) , uncontrolled , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , history pulmonary embolism thrombosis within last 5 year . New onset ( within 3 month prior randomization ) poorly control seizure . Patients know hypersensitivity active substance excipients . Pregnant lactating woman . Acute Erythroleukemia ( M6 FrenchAmericanBritish ( FAB ) classification ) Hemoglobin great equal 10g/dl Patients head neck cancer receive radiation therapy erythropoiesisstimulating agent ( ESAs ) give maintain hemoglobin level 12 g/dL . Patients metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy ESAs give maintain hemoglobin level 12 g/dL . Patients chronic kidney failure ESAs give maintain hemoglobin level 12 g/dL . Patients require major surgery would take study due high chance blood clot report take ESAs .</criteria>
