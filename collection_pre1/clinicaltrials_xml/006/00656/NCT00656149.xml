	<brief_summary>1 . To evaluate improvement hand function stable , cervical spinal cord injure ( SCI ) subject treated functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) -assisted exercise ; 2 . To compare information obtain exist qualitative quantitative hand function test newly develop test sensorimotor performance . Hypotheses : 1. performance task representative activity daily live ( ADL ) improve daily tele-supervised exercise affect hand . 2 . The improvement great one exercise protocol , protocol ) FES-assisted exercise workstation , b ) cyclical FES , weight train precision task . 3 . Scores derive quantitative data obtain sensor workstation correlate qualitative score primary outcome measure , ARAT hand function test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic C5 , 6 7 SCI subject sustain cervical SCI result complete incomplete quadriplegia . Time since injury least one year time entry study . Subjects may complete incomplete injury must demonstrate loss finger grasp release well loss thumb lateral ( key ) pinch bilaterally unilaterally . Subjects must stable neurologically medically , cognitively intact , willing able attend requisite appointment participation study . Two treatment , deliver 1 hour per day , five day week six week give randomized order . Treatment A Subjects perform 1 hour per day FES-assisted hand exercise instrument exercise workstation home , supervise remotely Internet . Four manipulanda workstation use per exercise session . Each manipulandum object spring-loaded doorknob , represent task daily life . As motor skill improve consecutive session , subject present manipulanda increase difficulty . A muscle stimulator garment provide subject FES-assisted exercise ( Prochazka et al . 1997b ) . Hand open closing wirelessly trigger earpiece detects small voluntary tooth-clicks . The stimulator system CSA-approved . Treatment B Subjects perform follow task 1 hour per day home , supervise remotely Internet . 1 . 20 minute weight training : range motion ( ROM ) movement wear wristlet , weight select reduce ROM maximum effort 50 % . 2 . 20 minute accuracy train use large computer mouse play simple enjoyable computer game provide subject feedback performance . 3 . 20 minute therapeutic electrical stimulation ( TES ) . This consist ON-OFF cyclical stimulation hand muscle stimulator garment , e.g . subject watch TV . The outcome measure test 2-week interval require visit Center Neuroscience University Alberta . A maximum CDN $ 2,000 available reimburse participant ' travel accommodation cost .</detailed_description>

Subjects may complete incomplete injury must demonstrate loss finger grasp release well loss thumb lateral ( key ) pinch bilaterally unilaterally . Subjects must stable neurologically medically , cognitively intact , willing able attend requisite appointment participation study . Subjects unresolved medical issue easily trigger autonomic dysreflexia and/or hypotension . Subjects demonstrate severe spasticity affect upper extremity , fix hand contracture loss suppleness range movement metacarpalphalangeal joint , absence voluntary ability extend wrist gravity and/or insufficient muscle strength abduct ( lift ) arm gravity . Subjects unresolved substance abuse problem Subjects history head injury , epilepsy self close relative and/or cognitive impairment Subjects intracranial metal inclusion Subjects , upon initial testing , demonstrate partial complete denervation ( loss nerve supply ) nerve target muscle .</criteria>
