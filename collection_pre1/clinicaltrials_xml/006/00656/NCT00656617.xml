	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dose vorinostat give combination idarubicin ara-C treatment AML high-risk MDS . Once high safe dose find , researcher try learn combination treatment help control AML high-risk MDS newly diagnose patient . The safety treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Idarubicin , Cytarabine , Vorinostat With High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Vorinostat design change gene expression profile leukemia cell , may cause cell die . Idarubicin design cause break DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may cause cancer cell die . Ara-C design insert DNA cancer cell stop DNA repairing . This dose combination test human , dose level schedule . Study Drug Administration : Induction Therapy : If find eligible take part study , begin induction therapy . During induction therapy , dose level vorinostat may vary base join study side effect see participant . The first group 3 participant receive high dose level vorinostat . If intolerable side effect experience , next group 3 participant receive low dose vorinostat . This continue high dose vorinostat intolerable side effect find . The dose level drug change . In Induction phase , receive 1 2 induction cycle therapy follow schedule : - On Days 1-3 , take vorinostat mouth 3 time day . - On Days 4-6 , receive idarubicin needle vein 1 hour . - On Days 4-7 , receive ara-C vein non-stop infusion . - On Days 4-7 , receive solumedrol dexamethasone help reduce risk side effect associate ara-C . The drug give vein second . Consolidation Therapy : If disease respond Induction , may able receive 5 additional 4-6 week study cycle . During Consolidation Cycles , take study drug follow cycle : - On Days 1-3 , take vorinostat mouth 3 time day . - On Days 4 5 , receive idarubicin needle vein 5 minute . - On Days 4-6 , receive ara-C vein non-stop infusion . - On Days 4 5 , also receive either solumedrol dexamethasone vein second . Maintenance Therapy : If go remission , begin maintenance therapy . While maintenance therapy , take vorinostat mouth 3 time day Days 1-14 28-day study cycle . You may 12 Maintenance Cycles . Study Visits : At least every week Cycle 1 , least month additional cycle , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You also routine bone marrow aspirate biopsy initiate treatment approximately Day 21 Day 28 initiate therapy . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug 18 cycle . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Idarubicin FDA approve use combination approve drug treatment AML . Vorinostat FDA approve commercially available treatment form cutaneous lymphoma . Ara-C FDA approve use treatment leukemia . The use drug together investigational . Up 105 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
