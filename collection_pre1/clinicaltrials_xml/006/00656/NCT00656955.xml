	<brief_summary>Background : In Central Europe , mortality rate kidney cancer higher survival rate lower United States Western Europe overall . The Central Eastern European Renal Cancer Case-Control Study ( CEERCC ) , complete 2002 , offer opportunity identify determinant predict 5-year survival among kidney cancer patient . Objectives : To assess disease recurrence progression among former participant CEERCC . To investigate effect genetics , lifestyle factor , medical condition , occupation diet outcome kidney cancer patient Europe . Eligibility : Former participant next-of-kin former participant CEERCC study . Design : Participants next-of-kin interview 60 minute request permission collect relevant information family member hospital cancer registry record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previously propose conduct follow-up study kidney cancer high risk region Central Eastern Europe . This study conduct follow-up group patient kidney cancer , previously enrol study entitle , Occupation , Genetic Susceptibility Kidney Cancer : Central European Case-Controls Study , PI Dr. Wong-Ho Chow , OEEB , DCEG , NCI , protocol No 01-C-NO63 , study field work data analysis case control study complete . We originally plan conduct follow-up study seven center four country , include Romania , Poland , Russia , Czech Republic . In center , cancer-related information extract vital statistic , cancer registry , and/or medical record . For deceased patient , next-of-kin interview use brief questionnaire . A pilot study conduct determine feasibility collect survival information include 5-year survival status , date death , cause death , date last follow-up alive 220 case across seven collaborate center . The feasibility extract additional data include surgical medical treatment procedure use treat primary disease , recurrence progression primary disease also determine . However , base result obtain pilot study , determine feasible collect follow-up data kidney cancer case four center Czech Republic one center Poland Russia . Medical records/archives Romanian case locate hospital completely destroy reconstruction therefore , impossible collect information subset patient . Exclusion record affect study power since case Czech Republic . The objective propose study remain : ( 1 ) ass 5-year survival status kidney cancer patient Central Easter European Renal Cell Carcinoma Study ; ( 2 ) examine prevalence recurrent disease progression ; ( 3 ) investigate additional patient-tumor-and genetic determinant 5-year survival case .</detailed_description>
