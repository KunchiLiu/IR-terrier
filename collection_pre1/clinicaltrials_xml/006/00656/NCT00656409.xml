	<brief_summary>Ataxia Telangiectasia ( AT ) autosomal recessive inherited condition cause mutation ATM gene1 . Patients suffer neuro-degenerative problem , usually commence second year life , affect predominantly cerebellum . They also develop characteristic superficial telangiectases . Between 60 80 % affected child immunodeficient . This associated deficiency immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) 2 , IgG23 antibody responses pneumococcal polysaccharides4 . Patients suffer recurrent sino-pulmonary infection recent study suggest poor correlation immune status immunological parameters5 . If uncontrolled , recurrent pulmonary infection contribute development chronic lung disease bronchiectasis . Preventative management include continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment need replacement immunoglobulin therapy small proportion case . Antibiotics reasonably effective situation emergence resistance amongst community acquire pneumococcal isolates cause concern . Appropriate immunisation strategy may also role . This study design look antibody responses one versus two dose regimen cohort AT patient recruit AT Society national charitable organisation involve provide support family condition foster education research field .</brief_summary>
