	<brief_summary>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-β1 ) consistently express fibrotic disease display variety profibrotic effect fibroblast . Activation TGF-β receptor induces activation several kinase signal cascade lead phosphorylation SMAD proteins well activation SMAD-independent kinase collectively activate ECM synthesis fibroblast growth differentiation myofibroblasts . TGF-β1 one main mediator fibrotic process , associate scar long list pathology relate chronic inflammation affect type organ tissue . An increase TGF-β1 mRNA protein level describe process . Peptide 144 ( P144 ) acetic salt 14mer peptide human TGF-β1 type III receptor ( betaglycan ) . P144 TGF-β1-inhibitor specifically design block interaction TGF-β1 TGF-β1 type III receptor , thus block biological effect . P144 show significant antifibrotic activity mouse receive repeat subcutaneous injection bleomycin , widely accept animal model human scleroderma , could contribute development . The purpose study assess tolerability safety topical application P144 healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerability Bioavailability P144 Peptide Inhibitor TGF-β1 After Topical Administration Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three different formulation DIGNA P144 cream ( contain 100 μg/mL , 200 μg/mL 300 μg/mL ) test healthy volunteer . Tolerability evaluation perform specific cutaneous tolerability visual scale Frosch Kligman . Safety assessment carry study vital sign , physical examination , perform laboratory test , electrocardiogram report adverse event experience . This first time P144 administer human . The topical route choose since indication P144 go clinically develop cutaneous sclerosis associate scleroderma . Systemic sclerosis scleroderma multisystemic disorder characterize excessive synthesis deposition extracellular matrix protein result fibrosis skin visceral organ ( include gastrointestinal tract , lung , heart kidney ) . The pathogenesis scleroderma complex still poorly understood , major pathway involve development condition microvascular immunological abnormality , well dysregulation fibroblast activity . One key molecule involve pathogenesis skin fibrosis TGF-β1 ; TGF-β1 cytokine directly responsible fibroblast proliferation collagen extracellular matrix overproduction . The affected skin patient systemic sclerosis gradually become firm , thicken eventually tightly bound underlie subcutaneous tissue ( indurative phase ) . It lose hair , oil , sweat gland become dry coarse . Changes begin distally extremity advance proximally . Lesions develop period time varying month year . In patient limited scleroderma , skin finger , hand , face low arm legs affected . On contrary , patient diffuse cutaneous disease , skin change become generalized , involve initially extremity follow face trunk . Rapid progression change 2 3 year period usually associate great risk visceral disease . After several year disease , skin may soften return normal thickness become thin atrophic . There currently approve specific treatment skin fibrosis systemic sclerosis neither European Union United States America . P144 belong peptide family able inhibit TGF-β1 vitro vivo model characterize excessive TGF-β1 function . Topical application P144 exert preventive effect preclude induction skin fibrosis accumulation collagen animal also show therapeutic property reduce skin fibrosis soluble collagen content mouse establish fibrosis .</detailed_description>
