	<brief_title>Dose-response Inhaled Formoterol Using Methacholine Challenge Bioassay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During screen visit , subjects'vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure temperature ) measure perform standard spirometry . If result test 70 % normal great , examined physician , blood ( 1 teaspoonful ) urine collect routine laboratory test ( CBC routine urinalysis ) . If female , pregnancy test perform . During second visit , subject inhale 1 2 dos formoterol , ( Foradil Aerolizer 12 mcg/capsule ) long-acting bronchodilator 1 hour later , perform methacholine test . At end methacholine test , give albuterol reverse effect methacholine . On third study day , repeat second visit opposite dose Foradil .</detailed_description>
