	<brief_summary>We develop train intervention successfully improve old adult ' memory . We also show old adult whose memory good young adult ' memory ( Hi-Old ) use alter pattern memory-related brain activity compare young adult , whereas healthy old adult poor memory ( Lo-Old ) . We also show individual amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( aMCI ) impairments conscious , effortful , Recollection-based memory process , whereas automatic , Familiarity-based memory process intact . Our primary current goal investigate whether successful memory intervention improve Recollection produce induce alter pattern brain activity Lo-Old aMCI . Young , Lo-Old , Hi-Old , aMCI scan use functional magnetic resonance image perform two memory task . Half Lo-Old half aMCI receive memory intervention , half group receive control program consist information game age . The Lo-Old aMCI rescanned perform two memory task . We predict memory intervention improve performance number memory task , induce alter pattern brain activity . In Lo-Old , brain activity memory intervention look like Hi-Old , brain activity become focal aMCI .</brief_summary>
