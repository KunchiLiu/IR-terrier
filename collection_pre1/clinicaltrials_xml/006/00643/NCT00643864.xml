	<brief_summary>The purpose project assess effect four week mirror-box training weakness one arm secondary stroke . Primary measure function strength . Secondary measure evaluate muscle tone , flexibility , subject 's perception everyday function improvement . Research Hypothesis : For chronic upper limb hemiparesis secondary stroke , four week mirror-box training movement unaffected limb result mean increase 10 point Fugl-Meyer Test Motor Recovery ( Upper Extremity ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirror-Box Training Adults With Chronic Hemiparesis Secondary Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due relatively new nature mirror training , randomize controlled study . This pilot case series serve initial step try identify frequency , duration , treatment exercise need population . Additionally , pilot allow u ensure outcome measure appropriate detect meaningful treatment change . After obtain informed consent , patient undergo two separate baseline assessment strength , function , tone 4 week apart . Training session consist supervised activity use unaffected arm observe mirror reflection ; affect arm remain still . Sessions one hour day , five day week , four week . Patients tested strength , function tone affect arm completion four week treatment period occupational therapist perform pretests .</detailed_description>
