	<brief_title>Rapid Switch From Flolan Remodulin Outpatient Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define elevation pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance , severe hemodynamic abnormality common variety disease syndromes . Elevation pulmonary arterial pressure cause increase right ventricular afterload , impair right ventricular function ultimately leading inactivity death . The goal PAH treatment lengthen survival time , ameliorate symptom PAH improve health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) . RemodulinÂ® ( treprostinil sodium ) , stable analogue prostacyclin , possess potent pulmonary systemic vasodilatory platelet anti-aggregatory action vitro vivo . Recently , Remodulin receive FDA approval intravenous therapy base upon bioequivalence IV SC rout administration . Remodulin chemically stable epoprostenol may offer potential safety convenience advantage compare intravenous epoprostenol may impact Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) and/or patient satisfaction . Unlike epoprostenol , Remodulin need mixed daily stable room temperature eliminate need ice pack . Furthermore , since Remodulin remain body longer epoprostenol ( 4 hr instead less 5 minute ) less risk cardiovascular collapse sudden interruption infusion , line clog . In open-label study Europe , patient use type portable medication pump call CADD Legacy pump rapidly switch Flolan Remodulin serious side effect . This study examine effect switch therapy epoprostenol Flolan IV Remodulin compare change HRQOL treatment satisfaction rapid switch epoprostenol Remodulin patient pulmonary hypertension use CADD legacy pump .</detailed_description>
