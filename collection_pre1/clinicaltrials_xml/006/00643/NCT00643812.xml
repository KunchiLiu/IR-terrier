	<detailed_description>Rates suicide among young Alaska Native male ten-fold high among similar age cohort rest United States . A high proportion death associate firearm . Firearms important part subsistence lifestyle population , however restriction access gun youth may promise strategy reduce risk suicide population . Recent work HIPRC show locked gun associate 73 % reduce risk suicide , compare unlocked gun . Similar protective association find unloaded gun . A recent pilot project improve storage gun conduct southwest Alaska increase proportion household gun lock 15 % 85 % . The aim propose study estimate prevalence firearm ownership specific firearm storage practice among resident live Bristol Bay Yukon-Kuskokwim region southwest Alaska work Alaska Native health corporation plan execute randomized trial intervention improve firearm storage practice among resident select village . This 3-year study consist two phase . The first phase regional survey household within 20 randomly select village southwest Alaska estimate extent firearm ownership exist storage practice community . This weighted sample would extrapolate overall estimate variable two Native corporation region . The second phase study two-arm randomize control trial intervention increase proportion household store firearm lock safe . A secondary outcome reduce proportion home reporting presence load gun . Households randomly assign either early late intervention group . The 'early ' intervention group receive intervention baseline . The 'late ' intervention group receive intervention 12 month baseline . All eligible household within participate village educate potential protective value safe firearm storage practice , offer gun safe store firearm . Household adult train use safe carefully restrict access gun youth . Each household complete questionnaire storage practice important co-variates baseline , 12 month , 18 month . Data analyze detect difference , group , proportion home unlocked gun , load gun , 12 18 month baseline . We estimate enrollment 350 home baseline provide 90 % power detect difference 16-20 absolute percentage point difference group , depend baseline prevalence variable . This study potential important effect firearm storage pattern population high risk suicide . If prove successful , could disseminate throughout Alaska high risk community .</detailed_description>
