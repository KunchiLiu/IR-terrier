	<detailed_description>Our long-term objective reduce incidence HIV people serious persistent mental illness ( SMI ) develop effective primary secondary HIV risk reduction intervention population easily deliver `` real world '' setting patient routinely receive care . Research find document incidence HIV infection , sexually transmit disease , sexual drug use behavior high among people serious mental illness , evidence rate HIV infection sexually-transmitted disease ( STDs ) . A variety factor underlie risky behavior SMI , include cognitive impairment , poor judgment , affective instability impulsiveness . Skills-building ( SB ) HIV risk reduction intervention , typically deliver small group format , modest success increase HIV-related knowledge improve risk reduction skill people SMI , although effect transient . As skills-building intervention currently standard care research clinical setting HIV prevention , important identify new way augment intervention . A relatively new promise addition armamentarium individualized intervention Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) . MI approach design reduce ambivalence enhance intrinsic motivation change problematic behavior . Previous researcher note effect SB MI intervention independently , however , effect tend fairly modest . Integrating approach systematize way allow u test degree combination useful , give motivation skill clearly important effect health behavior change . Our specific primary aim follow : 1 . To adapt SB MI intervention HIV risk reduction men woman serious persistent mental illness ( SMI ) . Interventions HIV risk reduction people SMI typically offer group format focus primarily skills-building . We develop refine brief , individually-tailored skills-building intervention ( SB Intervention ) , base exist manual . We also adapt refined brief individually-tailored Motivational Interviewing intervention target HIV risk behavior , incorporate skills-building technique analogous SB intervention , result Motivational-Interviewing &amp; Skills-Building Intervention ( SB-MI Intervention ) . Adaptation refinement SB SB-MI intervention inform consult expert MI , SMI , HIV risk reduction , elicit feedback advisory board provider consumer , conduct feedback interview participant complete participation study . 2 . To pilot test obtain preliminary data regard feasibility intervention differences outcome associate SB SB-MI intervention reduction HIV-related risk behavior cohort SMI adult . Comparison SB SB-MI intervention propose pilot study allow u assess degree incorporation motivational technique helpful augment skills-building intervention HIV risk reduction people SMI . These preliminary analysis inform need refine adapt intervention ( SB SB-MI ) . 3 . To offer HIV counsel test at-risk individual SMI , emphasis connect participant appropriate medical mental health service . To date , increase rate HIV counsel test SMI primary focus clinical research , believe significant public health deficit . As part intervention provide information HIV counseling test service participant identify HIV-seropositive encouraging access service . We track degree participant follow referral part follow-up evaluation . This allow u test degree intervention helpful increase rate HIV test . 4 . To begin explore relationship participant characteristic , HIV risk behavior , response intervention . One unique feature intervention assume individually-tailored approach , address unique patient characteristic inherent heterogeneous sample . Indeed , use heterogeneous sample greatly facilitate primary long-term objective , develop useable intervention adapt real-world setting . This project allow u begin identify characteristic likely associate positive outcome ( i.e . great risk reduction , increase rate HIV test ) .</detailed_description>
