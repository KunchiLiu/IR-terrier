	<detailed_description>( IRB # Pro00005035 ) The purpose study determine role nitric oxide ( NO ) asthma characterize symptom associate inhaled endotoxin normal subject . The effect inhale endotoxin exhale NO determine healthy African Americans , without NOS2 promoter polymorphism . The protocol involve use NIH Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin approve FDA IND BB-IND-10035 . Background &amp; significance : Asthma significant cause morbidity mortality African Americans asthma increase prevalence . Both environmental genetic factor contribute pathogenesis asthma . In addition allergen , environmental lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) endotoxin play important role chronic inflammation associate asthma . There convince evidence endotoxin exacerbate airflow obstruction airway inflammation allergic asthmatic . Endotoxin increase inducible nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ) expression nitric oxide ( NO ) production vitro vivo human . In asthma , NOS2 expression upregulated several cell type include bronchial epithelium , macrophages inflammatory cell . The increase NOS2 expression associate increase exhale NO individual asthma compare healthy individual . This prompt search NOS2 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) subsequent identification three NOS2 promoter SNPs . Two SNPs associate increase systemic NO level . Another SNP create predict bind site human homolog delta EF1 , transcriptional repressor predict SNP would associate low NO level . Importantly , three NOS2 promoter SNPs link , segregate together present primarily individual African ancestry . Design &amp; procedure : The study exhale NO level individual asthma confound presence cell type besides bronchial epithelium produce NO , differences severity asthma use medication corticosteroid alter exhale NO level . Therefore , protocol exhale NO level measure asymptomatic healthy African Americans . Thirty individual ( 10 individual polymorphism ) heterozygous NOS2 promoter SNPs 10 individual without NOS2 promoter SNPs study . The decision study 10 individual group base power analysis ( 80 % power , 0.05 alpha ) use available data NO level normal individual follow endotoxin challenge . Because basal NO level patient asthma approximately twice normal individual , decide two-fold difference exhale NO level follow endotoxin challenge represent meaningful difference . The general design study identify healthy nonasthmatic , nonatopic , never cigarette smoker history airway reactivity , subject specific incremental challenge inhale LPS determine airway reactivity inhale endotoxin . Upon recruitment , study subject schedule seven separate visit , option 3 additional visit challenge . During initial visit , study participant undergo thorough clinical evaluation include 2 questionnaire , physical examination , skin test assess presence atopy , full pulmonary function testing , chest x-ray , EKG , methacholine challenge test ass airway hyperreactivity , exhale nitric oxide exhale breath condensate sample measure inflammatory mediator . During challenge visit , subject undergo specific incremental challenge inhale endotoxin vehicle ( saline ) . The initial evaluation endotoxin inhalation challenge separate minimum two week . A brief follow visit schedule collect blood sample , exhale gas 24 , 48 , 72hours 7 day endotoxin challenge obtain full pulmonary function test airway resistance perform baseline . To avoid problem diurnal variation pulmonary function , test session begin 8:00 AM . All test perform Rankin Duke Clinical Research Unit Duke University . Serum pregnancy test perform initial visit day endotoxin saline inhalation challenge exclude pregnant woman study . Administration endotoxin saline occur result pregnancy test return negative . In addition serum pregnancy test , blood sample obtain determine IgE level ( determine whether subject allergy ; determine visit 1 ) , cotinine level ( metabolite nicotine use determine whether subject smoke ; determine visit 1 , 2 , 4 6 ) , CRP cytokine level ( marker inflammation use determine whether systemic response inhale endotoxin occur ; determine visit 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 ) , RNA level ( analyze use gene array use determine whether systemic response inhale endotoxin occur ; determine visit 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 ) . On visit 2 , 4 6 , CRP , cytokine RNA level determine three time , initially establish baseline level 2 6 hour endotoxin saline challenge . On visit 3 , 5 7 , CRP , cytokine RNA level determine . The URI questionnaire administer begin visit ass whether subject symptoms consistent URI cold . The Duke Investigational Pharmacy prepare inhaled solution endotoxin accord standard protocol use successfully investigator , well laboratory . Each subject receive initial dose Saline Solution baseline . During second visit , inhalation contain increase concentration endotoxin ( Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin ( CCRE ) , lot endotoxin prepare bacterial strain E. Coli O:113 maintain Pharmaceutical Development Service , Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center , National Institutes Health ) accord follow schedule : 5,000 EU ( endotoxin unit ) ; 10,000 EU ; 20,000 EU . During high dose challenge visit , inhalation contain 40,000 EU 80,000 EU endotoxin . Following inhalation dose endotoxin saline challenge , obtain several spirometric measure airflow . Airflow assess 1 , 10 , 20 , 30 minute follow dose inhale LPS saline . If study subject 's FEV1 80 % baseline measurement , inhalation challenge continue next high dose endotoxin administer . During control visit , saline control administer three occasion . After dose inhale endotoxin saline , non-pulmonary adverse event assess grade . The protocol conclude follow criterion meet : 1 ) subject wish continue reason ; 2 ) subject 's FEV1 decrease 20 % baseline saline inhalation ; 3 ) total dose 35,000 unit ( low dose challenge visit ) 120,000 unit ( high dose challenge visit ) achieve ; 4 ) subject experience adverse event rat severe adverse event deem significant opinion investigator . Following completion inhale endotoxin saline challenge , pulmonary function study , vital sign symptom assessment perform assess safety inhale endotoxin procedure ( see attach IND protocol detail ) . We also collect exhaled breath condensate sample measure inflammatory mediator include leukotrienes control confound effect airway inflammation exhale NO level . Exhaled breath condensate collect subject breathe normally approximately 10 minute apparatus trap condensation cool exhale breath . We measure airway resistance 1 , 2 , 6 24 hour endotoxin saline challenge . Measurement spirometry , lung volume , diffuse capacity repeat 6 hour 24 hour post challenge . We measure exhale NO level use online chemiluminescent detector ( Sievers 280i ) prior 1 , 2 6 hour endotoxin saline challenge . We also measure exhale NO level 24 hour exposure endotoxin saline . Subjects request come additional optional physiologic measurement 48 , 72 168 hour post challenge gather data time course . For optional visit challenge , subject vital sign measure , CRP serum inflammatory marker draw . Subjects perform spirometry , lung volume , diffuse capacity , exhale NO level , airway resistance , complete short questionnaire . NOTE : In separate relate IRB protocol prior study : In Phase 1 , ( IRB # Pro00005046 ) determine effect promoter polymorphism gene NO produce enzyme , nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ) , exhale NO healthy African Americans . Individuals consent Phase 1 ask willing contacted future study include described Phase 2 study . 30 individual ( 10 individual polymorphism ) identify Phase 1 heterozygous NOS2 promoter SNPs 10 individual without NOS2 promoter SNPs study . Because SNPs TLR4 gene result lack airway obstruction response endotoxin , genotype 1000 DNA sample Asp299Gly Thr399Ile TLR4 polymorphisms Phase 1 exclude individual study propose Phase 2 . Likewise , CD14 serve coreceptor endotoxin polymorphism CD14 gene promoter associate asthma responsiveness endotoxin . Therefore , control potential confounder analysis , also test whether polymorphism CD14 gene promoter associate responsiveness inhale endotoxin .</detailed_description>
