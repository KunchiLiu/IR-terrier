	<brief_summary>Research Question : Are anastomotic leak surgical site infection rate equivalent patient laparoscopic bowel resection without bowel preparation v bowel preparation ? Bowel preparation distress uncomfortable procedure patient undergo laparoscopic colorectal surgery , also carry risk morbidity due dehydration , electrolyte inbalance possible infectious complication . If find difference patient preoperative bowel prep , save patient additional distress risk time surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The question whether bowel prep need colon resection open surgery answer . However , laparoscopic colorectal resection , prospectively investigate . Usually , reason still use bowel prep laparoscopic colon resection small instrument grasp colon tear , without prep , stool spillage result . As well , may difficult manipulate colon fill stool , difficult identify lesion resect . There previous randomized trial laparoscopic literature compare laparoscopic colorectal resection without bowel preparation . There number trial open resection one trial include laparoscopic open resection . Unfortunately trial separate data analysis two group . Primary Secondary Outcomes : The question identify whether anastomotic leak , surgical site infection rate equivalent patient laparoscopic resection without bowel prep versus prepped patient . Methodology : Once consent obtain , patient randomize two groups-the study group eat low residue diet prior surgery undergo bowel preparation , control group complete standard bowel preparation protocol . Both group schedule surgery . All patient monitor sign anastomotic leak surgical wound infection daily hospital routine follow visit 2 6 week postoperative . If two complication observe , standard treatment follow .</detailed_description>
