	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia encounter clinical practice . The incidence prevalence AF increase exponentially increase age AF associate high mortality , frequent hospitalization , low quality life . Furthermore , AF often associate heart failure . The majority AF initiate ectopic focus find primarily pulmonary vein . It show catheter ablation vein could eliminate episode AF . In patient heart failure , catheter ablation could improve cardiac function , symptom quality life . It remain still unknown whether AF ablation effective conventional treatment term mortality morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia encounter clinical practice ; incidence prevalence increase exponentially increase age associate increased mortality , frequent hospitalization , decrease quality life . An initial approach cure patient suffer AF surgical intervention Maze procedure , involve creation linear lesion atria break re-entrant wavefront responsible maintenance AF . Subsequently , less invasive procedure develop achieve result . One catheter base radio frequency ablation , catheter place heart percutaneously , follow application electrical energy target region , thereby create permanent lesion . The origin AF often localize pulmonary vein ( PVs ) ; therefore one common approach ablate order electrically isolate leave atrium ( LA ) . Several strategy develop , linear , segmental , circumferential , double-lasso . Additionally , anatomical region right atrium ( RA ) , superior vena cava ( SVC ) , coronary sinus ( CS ) ablate order eliminate non-PV driver AF . Heart failure ( HF ) frequently chronic lethal condition , cause substantial morbidity , initial diagnosis , result mortality rate come close exceed many malignancy . Both AF HF significant impact health care expenditures . The two disease often coexist , complex interaction : many process predispose HF , hypertension , diabetes , coronary artery disease , valvular heart disease , also risk factor development AF . Similarly , many echocardiographic finding common patient HF , include LA enlargement , increase leave ventricular ( LV ) wall thickness , reduce LV fractional shortening , predispose patient development AF . In small group patient suffer HF AF , radio frequency ablation perform ; restoration sinus rhythm result improvement quality life , exercise performance , cardiac parameter like ejection fraction fractional shortening . It still unknown therapy also effective reduce mortality morbidity . CASTLE-AF prospective , unblinded , randomize , multicenter study whose aim compare effect radio frequency catheter-based ablation mortality morbidity conventional treatment HF subject AF . About 420 patient LV dysfunction ( ejection fraction ≤ 35 % ) New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class ≥ II , already implant dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) Home Monitoring® capability , enrol randomized 1:1 undergo either AF ablation standard treatment indicated American College Cardiology ( ACC ) /American Heart Association ( AHA ) /European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) 2006 guideline management patient AF . In addition plan unplanned visit , ablate patient constantly monitor remotely via Home Monitoring® , order detect recurrence AF episode , even non-symptomatic short duration , observational period minimum 3 year patient .</detailed_description>
