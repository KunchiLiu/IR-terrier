	<brief_summary>The objective trial : - To determine localisation within primary tumor therapy resistant cell , radiotherapy determine possible accurate boost volume . - To determine change treatment intra- extratumoral within irradiated area . ( Intratumoral : change up-take - decrease , increase , change localization/ Extratumoral : effect temporal change up-take - e.g . due oedema ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients harbor primary intracerebral high grade tumor ( WHO III- IV ) median survival six 12 month . Combined chemoradiotherapy temozolomide standard care since result joint EORTC-NCIC phase III study randomize radiotherapy alone combine radiochemotherapy temozolomide show significant improvement 2-years survival 8 % 24 % combine treatment arm ( Stupp 2005 ) . A differentiation possible responder non-responders start irradiation may eventual possible use 18F-FDG PET-CT . Preliminary result show high metabolic activity glioblastoma measure simulation 18F-FDG PET-CT scan prognosticator shorten survival ( Baumert , 2006 ) . Our preliminary data show high uptake 18F-FDG PET-CT scan radiotherapy glioblastoma could marker reduce survival . Popperl et al show dual phase FDG PET image superior differentiate low-grade high-grade recurrent astrocytomas ( Popperl , 2006 ) . Visual analysis delineation glioma show delayed image ( image first 0-90 min twice later 180-480 min injection ) well distinguish high uptake tumor relative uptake gray matter . SUV comparison also show great uptake tumor gray matter , brain , white matter delay time ( Spence et al ) . These finding support view use FDG-PET scan could image active area within tumor . Indeed , vivo , cancer make different type cell , include hypoxic cell , cell proliferate fast , well non-malignant tissue , include inflammatory cell vasculature . Intra-tumor heterogeneity malignant glioma often observe visualise also current PET-CT technique . The dynamic tracer uptake different tumor sub-volumes may give important information biological characteristic well . Indeed , dynamic FDG uptake per cell dependent blood flow , uptake cell phosphorylation . All step give information biology cancer particular area tumor .</detailed_description>
