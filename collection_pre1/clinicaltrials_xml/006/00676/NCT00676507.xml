	<brief_summary>Rationale : Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may help body build immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether vaccine therapy effective placebo maintenance therapy treatment subject non-small cell lung cancer . Purpose : This randomized phase III trial study vaccine therapy see well work compare placebo treat subject stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Lucanix™ Vaccine Therapy Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Following Front-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Efficacy Endpoints : - Compare overall survival subject stage III IV non-small cell lung cancer treat belagenpumatucel-L ( Lucanix™ ) v placebo . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : - Evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) subject treat Lucanix™ compare treatment within BSC control group . - Evaluate quality life ( QOL ) determine Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ( LCSS ) compare treatment within BSC control group . - Evaluate time-to-progression subject treat Lucanix™ compare treatment within BSC control group . - Evaluate best overall tumor response subject treat Lucanix™ compare treatment BSC control group . - Evaluate response duration subject treat Lucanix™ compare BSC control group . - Evaluate rate CNS metastases development subject treat Lucanix™ compare BSC control group . - Adverse event subject treat Lucanix™ compare subject control group . Outline : This multicenter study . Subjects stratify accord disease stage ( IIIA vs IIIB IV ) , response prior treatment front-line chemotherapy ( stable disease vs partial response complete response ) , prior treatment front-line chemotherapy radiotherapy ( front-line chemotherapy radiotherapy v front-line chemotherapy alone ) , prior treatment front-line chemotherapy anticancer therapy ( front-line chemotherapy bevacizumab v front-line chemotherapy alone combination another anticancer agent ) . Subjects randomized 1 2 treatment arm . - Treatment Arm : Subjects receive belagenpumatucel-L ( Lucanix™ ) intradermally ( ID ) monthly 18 month 21 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Control Arm : Subjects receive placebo ID monthly 18 month 21 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect analyzed routine chemistry , cytokine , chemokines , instance circulate tumor cell , include response multiple lung cancer-associated antigen IFN-γ ELISPOT CD8+ assay ; CEA CD4 class II assay ; lung tumor-associated antigen vitro proliferation assay ; regulatory T-cell ( Treg ) phenotype flow cytometry ; Treg function . Subjects complete Lung Cancer Symptom Scale quality life questionnaire baseline , day treatment , 30 day completion study treatment , every 3 month 1 year . After completion study treatment , subject follow every 3 month 1 year annually 4 year . In two phase II trial , many subject receive Lucanix™ dose administer trial long-term disease stability good quality life .</detailed_description>
