	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) follow myeloablative non-myeloablative conditioning therapy proven curative treatment number inherit acquire hematologic disorder . The success allogeneic transplantation largely determined compatibility donor recipient , predict risk fatal graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Unfortunately , less one third patient need allogeneic transplant available compatible donor family . Registries establish match patient compatible volunteer ( unrelated ) donor , many patient , particular minority patient , still lack stem cell donor . Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) rich source hematopoietic stem cell , readily available placenta follow childbirth . Blood bank establish United States abroad collect , process store UCB use allogeneic transplantation . To date , 2000 UCB transplant perform adult child around world . Rationale use Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation UCB number proven theoretical advantage alternative source hematopoietic stem cell transplantation : 1 . Placental umbilical cord blood abundantly available source stem cell , currently discard harvest risk mother infant . 2 . Important infectious agent , particularly CMV , much less common newborn adult , less likely contaminate UCB collection . 3 . UCB collection , type , cryopreserved bank , available demand , eliminate delay uncertainty complicate marrow collection unrelated donor . At present , UCB deliver infusion within day initiation search . This compare median 3 month search delivery stem cell registry volunteer adult donor . 4 . The intensity graft-versus-host reactivity fetal lymphocytes appear less adult cell consequently fetal lymphocyte tolerant HLA incompatibility . Published study show transplantation UCB match 4-5/6 antigen result comparable incidence GVHD transplantation unrelated stem cell fully match 6/6 antigen . 5 . Frozen UCB easily ship , store treat institution , thaw use need , compare freshly donate stem cell limit shelf-life one day less , necessitate coordination harvest surgeon , transportation , transplantation team . This research study design people diagnose blood tumor , respond treatment recur , bone marrow failure state aplastic anemia , one certain inherit metabolic disorder ; whose doctor feel best treatment allogeneic stem cell transplant ( alloSCT ) relate unrelated adult donor available . Instead , single unit umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) use source subject 's immune system . This study design determine whether single unit UCB substitute adult bone marrow cell standard stem cell transplant regimen use hospital subject stem cell donor .</detailed_description>
