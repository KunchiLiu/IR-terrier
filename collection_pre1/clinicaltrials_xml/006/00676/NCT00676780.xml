	<detailed_description>To evaluate short-term effect daily dose Polyphenon E administer interval prostate biopsy radical prostatectomy men recently diagnose prostate cancer . Endpoints change serum tissue biomarkers related progression cancer . The effect Polyphenon E tumor cell c-Met expression phosphorylation primary objective . Secondary objective include effect tissue serum biomarkers . Evaluation safety tolerability Polyphenon E subject population another objective . 1.1 Determine effect Polyphenon E tumor cell c-Met expression phosphorylation level patient prostate cancer 1.2 Determine effect Polyphenon E PI-3K activation patient prostate cancer 1.3 Determine effect Polyphenon E MAPK activation patient prostate cancer 1.4 Determine effect Polyphenon E expression level proteins involve motility invasion Rho GTPases extracellular proteinase patient prostate cancer 1.5 Determine effect Polyphenon E marker angiogenesis patient prostate cancer 1.6 Determine effect Polyphenon E serum Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) patient prostate cancer 1.7 Determine effect Polyphenon E serum marker : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Insulin-Like Growth factor I ( IGF-I ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) , Hepatocyte Growth Factor HGF 1.8 Evaluate safety tolerability Polyphenon E subject population</detailed_description>
