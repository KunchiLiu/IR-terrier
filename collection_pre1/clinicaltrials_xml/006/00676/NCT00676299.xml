	<detailed_description>JNJ-26483327 , multi-targeted reversible kinase inhibitor , new drug development treatment cancer . This study test safety ( effect body ) JNJ-26483327 high dose JNJ-26483327 patient advance cancer tolerate determine . Antitumor activity JNJ-26481585 evaluate . JNJ-26483327 administer continuous regimen ( orally twice daily ) 28-day treatment cycle . The dose JNJ-26483327 start low increase study group 1 6 patient . If patient group patient severe side effect , next group patient get high dose . The dose increase patient severe side effect . The dose decrease dose level severe side effect observe less 1/3 patient . Once safe dose level determine additional group 12-18 patient treat . The amount JNJ-26483327 blood measure effect disease evaluate patient . Patients screen eligibility within 4 week study treatment give . The treatment consist 28-day treatment cycle continuous twice daily dose regimen . During Cycle 1 , patient require stay hospital 2-3 night 2 full day . In addition 5 daytime visit Cycles 1 2 ( combine ) may take 6 hour morning dose . From Cycle 3 onwards , one hospital visit require cycle treatment . Throughout study , especially Cycles 1 2 , patient undergo frequent blood urine test , procedure assess safety include heart function , test assess course patient 's illness . The duration treatment depend adverse effect whether benefit treatment . Two week last dose study drug , patient require return study site follow-up assessment . Patients take JNJ-26483327 capsule mouth twice day throughout treatment . Patients allow continue dose level long unacceptable side effect , benefit patient base study doctor 's evaluation .</detailed_description>
