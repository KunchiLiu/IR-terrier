	<brief_title>Combined aPproach Treatment Using Ranibizumab Efalizumab Diabetic Macular Edema Study : The CAPTURE DME Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cell adhesion molecule key mediator inflammatory process , show play role pathogenesis diabetic retinopathy . Efalizumab inhibit bind leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 ( LFA-1 ) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) thereby inhibit adhesion leukocyte cell type . Clinical study demonstrate bioactivities intravitreal ranibizumab , Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antagonist , reduce retinal thickness improve visual acuity patient diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . The objective CAPTURE Study assess safety tolerability efalizumab , administer subcutaneously weekly ( 1 mg/kg ) dose , compare combination ranibizumab , administer intravitreally ( 0.5 mg ) , treatment DME .</detailed_description>
