	<detailed_description>Rational : TBI cause life-long impairment physical , cognitive , behavioral social function usually disable residual physical deficit . Recovery continue many year initial trauma . Little known optimal methodology treat vast complicated secondary manifestation combat relate TBI . Applicability : The goal rehabilitation program eventually optimally define telerehabilitation service Veterans polytrauma , include accurate efficient screen instrument , educational material patient family , family support , family counsel enhance care coordination maximize functional outcome quality life . Patient population : The program help wound Veterans diagnosis TBI combat operation Iraq Afghanistan . Many Veterans reside rural underserved area . Although access health care rural patient remain critical challenge , telerehabilitation may represent viable mean delivery therapeutic service patient , particularly serve VA . The program implication civilian population well include injure automobile industrial accident similar illness cohort Veterans investigator intend follow . Clinical application , benefit risk : The goal rehabilitation project enhance wound Veteran 's capacity process interpret information improve ability function aspect family community life . It involve combination restorative training focus improve specific cognitive function compensatory training educates Veterans adapt presence cognitive deficit may may curable use singular one one interventions well integrated interdisciplinary approach target multiple condition . The investigator see risk involve clinical intervention . Projected time achieve consumer-related outcome : The result telerehabilitation project immediately available dissemination throughout VA . The VA already commit nationwide rollout similar telerehabilitation project wound Veterans . Hence , finding immediate application VA care returnees combat . The investigator recently add MyHealtheVet TeleRehab I care coordination exist TeleRehab I subject .

A total 75 85 IRB-approved subject initially enrol . The investigator want enroll 10 new subject , exist TeleRehab I subject ask sign revise ICF add MyHealtheVet study , make change ICF require Tampa VA R &amp; D . If subject consent require register authenticate use MyHealtheVet order participate continue participate study . An additional 6 subject enrol total 81 subject demographic data collect . Sufficient data collect 75 subject analysis responses survey . MyHealtheVet enrollment secure message authentication require continue study , change protocol reflect additional eligibility criterion . All method communication subject exist survey continue . Eventually MyHealtheVet replace LAMP secure communication Care Coordinator .</detailed_description>
