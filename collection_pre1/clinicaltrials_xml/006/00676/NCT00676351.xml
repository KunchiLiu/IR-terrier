	<detailed_description>Asthma affect large population throughout world two million person France , kill two hundred patient year . A significant proportion case asthma diagnose childhood . Understanding relation early-life infectious exposure asthma atopy appear considerable interest . Respiratory infectious illness , mostly viral , common childhood . Bronchiolitis common low respiratory tract illness ( LRI ) early life ( 1 ) . It commonly cause respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) often associate subsequent wheeze childhood asthma ( 2 ) . Respiratory infectious illness cause agent RSV also associate asthma atopy ( 3 ) . However , relation respiratory infectious illness early life asthma childhood much debate since study show relationship bronchiolitis atopy ( 4 ) others ( 5 , 6 ) . The present work prospective study undertaken highlight possible relationship LRI early life trigger atopy asthma 3 year-old childhood , use paediatric lung function test . Twenty nine infant ( 8 female 21 male ) include study 8 29 infant premature birth . The young patient 3 month old old fourteen month old . The beginning study start least three week first bronchiolitis episode . Pulmonary function test realize use body plethysmography ( Babybody , Erich Jaeger , Germany ) . Same test perform 18 24 month . At 30 36 month , pulmonary function evaluate measure respiratory resistance use oscillometry system occlusion system ( Masterlab-IOS , Erich Jaeger , Germany ) . All respiratory test perform patient asymptomatic respiratory condition least one month apart respiratory infection . If measure data show obstruction , bronchodilator inhale assess reversibility . When result normal , bronchial provocation test , use inhaled metacholine , perform . Skin prick test ( SPTs ) perform first exam , 24 36 month ( Stallergenes-DHS ) . Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus , alternaria , cat dander , cockroach , orchard grass timothy grass systematically test . The SPTs consider positive wheal diameter 3 mm 50 % large positive control , negative control remain negative ( 7 ) . The possibility dermographism eliminate negative reaction negative control . Collection data largely incomplete due number patient lose follow . Briefly , base available data , lung test result normal range although proportion patient experience recurrent wheeze episode follow . Nevertheless bronchial hyper reactivity metacholine document 41 % . Atopy , screen SPTs , detect minority infant ( 13.5 % ) . Coexistence bronchial hyper reactivity atopy present one patient . These incomplete result highlight complex interplay symptom , bronchial obstruction , bronchial hyper reactivity atopy subsequent development asthma wheezy child . Long term follow necessary ass prognostic value parameter .</detailed_description>
