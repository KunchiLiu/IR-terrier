	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand tuberculosis ( TB ) risk infection TB , Peru . TB disease cause bacteria transmit droplet air come lung infect person . The risk infection compare two group : household member , live people TB respond well treatment household member , live people TB respond well treatment . Study participant include 4,500 TB infect people 22,500 household contact . Study procedure include answer questionnaire , TB skin test , blood sample , chest x-ray . Individuals symptoms indicate TB ask provide sputum sample . Individuals TB involve study 48 month ; household contact involve study 12 month . The knowledge gain study use improve tuberculosis control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The emergence drug-resistant multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium ( M ) tuberculosis pose significant threat global tuberculosis ( TB ) control strategy . The prospective design study allow direct study infection risk , population among TB case arise identify monitored course study . This study design permit characterization comparison TB strain differential success cause new infection . The study conduct within well-established public health TB control program region Peru , drug-resistant strain already account 20 percent new TB case . This study protocol implement collaboration 52 Ministry Health outpatient health center 4 district Lima , Peru . This prospective cohort study enrollment period 36 consecutive month . Two type study subject enrol : patient find active TB disease routine testing ( TB index subject ) , individual live household patient ( household member ) . Study participant include 4,500 subject active TB approximately 22,500 household member . Ages range less 1-100 year . The tuberculin skin test use diagnose latent TB infection household member . This product use routinely health center staff household member child age group less than1-15 year . In study protocol , also use household member age 16 year old . Each TB index subject remain study minimum 12 month maximum 48 month . Each household member remain study 12 month . The primary objective study measure risk infection household member index case drug-resistant TB compare risk infection household member subject drug-sensitive TB . This refers household member tuberculin-skin-test negative begin follow-up . Secondary study objective : assess impact sociodemographic clinical confounders risk modifier age , sex , comorbidity , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , nutritional status , Bacille Calmette Guerin ( BCG ) vaccination association risk infection exposure drug-resistant drug-sensitive strain ; measure association specific mutation associate drug resistance M tuberculosis phenotype include resistance profile , clinical presentation , transmissibility ; measure rate true relapse versus reinfection drug-resistant drug-sensitive TB subject use molecular-epidemiologic method ; measure rate reversion ( negative ) tuberculin skin test among household member positive tuberculin skin test result . The primary study outcome measure relative risk TB infection ( tuberculin skin test ) household member subject sick drug-resistant M tuberculosis strain compare household member subject drug-sensitive strain . Secondary study outcome measure rate relapse rate reinfection among TB subject treat routine TB therapy outpatient health center ; rate reversion ( negative ) tuberculin skin test among household member positive tuberculin skin test result .</detailed_description>
