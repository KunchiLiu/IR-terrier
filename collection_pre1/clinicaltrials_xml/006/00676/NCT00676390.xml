	<brief_summary>The treatment follow-up congestive heart failure ( CHF ) represent major part France 's health expense . The beneficial effect cardiac rehabilitation well establish , especially regard reduction dyspnea , exercise limitation fatigue lead ultimately well quality life . Maintaining benefit secondary prevention require improvement daily physical activity , challenge supposes close follow-up difficult perform daily live basis . However , good knowledge type dose daily physical activity population would beneficial practitioner prescribe advise individually type dose physical activity require maintain benefit cardiac rehabilitation . To date , physical activity questionnaire adapt CHF could provide information regard type dose daily physical activity . Such questionnaire develop research team allow estimation daily energy expenditure well daily energy expend physical activity dimension ( rest , activity &lt; 3 MET , activity 3 5 MET , activity &gt; 5 MET ) . During first step validation , daily physical activity energy expenditure estimate questionnaire correlate various factor physical condition notably , peak V'O2 ( R=0.71 ) , prognostic factor largely recognize CHF . A second step validation pilot study compare estimation daily energy expenditure questionnaire measurement free-living daily energy expenditure doubly label water ( DLW ) method 11 middle-aged male patient suffer CHF ( NYHA I III ) . Daily energy expenditure estimate questionnaire close daily energy expenditure measure DLW method ( R2 = 0.81 ; individual relative error &lt; 7 % ) . However , high cost DLW method reduce population study small sample , major limitation study since sample somewhat different general CHF population France .</brief_summary>
