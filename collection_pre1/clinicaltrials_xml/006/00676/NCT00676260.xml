	<brief_title>Efficacy Pioglitazone Microcirculation Type 2 Diabetes Patients Treated With Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pioglitazone thiazolidinedione compound mode action peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist . Activation receptor cause increase transcriptional activity number location important carbohydrate lipid ( fat ) metabolism . Insulin resistance reverse enhance action insulin , thereby promote glucose utilization peripheral tissue , suppress gluconeogenesis liver , reduce lipolysis adipocyte . In previous study pioglitazone , peripheral edema ( swell hand , foot , leg ) report adverse event often pioglitazone group appear dose dependent phenomenon pioglitazone . The incidence peripheral edema monotherapy study 3.2 % pioglitazone patient compare 0.7 % placebo patient report female male . This incidence high pioglitazone combine sulphonylurea insulin ( 5.9 % 15.6 % , respectively ) . In comparison , incidence edema , sulphonylurea insulin combine placebo , 2.1 % 7.5 % , respectively . This study design identify mechanism underlie peripheral edema formation pioglitazone patient Type 2 diabetes . Individuals participate study provide write informed consent require commit screen visit approximately 4 additional visit study center . Study participation anticipate 10 12 week ( approximately 3 month ) . Multiple procedure occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination electrocardiograms .</detailed_description>
