	<brief_summary>This research aim find inflammation patient suffer severe asthma different non−severe asthma , may prevent corticosteroid work efficiently severe asthma . It look , particular , protein enzyme call p38 mitogen−activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK short ) control activation several important pathway cell . We wish find whether enzyme active cell obtain patient severe asthma compare non−severe asthma . We would like understand enzyme cause cell respond le well anti−inflammatory effect corticosteroid . We also wish find whether specific inhibitor p38 MAPK improve severe asthma improve effect corticosteroid cell . We hypothesise activation intracellular MAPK signal pathway underlies inflammatory process severe asthma , lead diminution anti-inflammatory action CS histone modification .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN Comparative study analyse difference characteristic lung macrophage blood monocytes non-severe severe asthmatic . AIMS 1 . To determine whether difference term cell expression activation lung macrophage blood monocytes non-severe severe asthma 2 . To determine mechanism lung macrophage blood monocyte relative resistance effect corticosteroid severe asthma , particularly focus role p38 MAPK 3 . To determine difference airway smooth muscle cell non-severe severe asthma OUTCOME MEASURES 1 . Clinically differences inflammatory remodelling marker non-severe severe asthma 2 . Differences histone phosphorylation , NF-kB activity glucocorticoid receptor activation action macrophages monocyte non- severe severe asthma 3 . Differences behaviour airway smooth muscle cell culture biopsy obtain non-severe severe asthma Severe non-severe asthmatic subject classify follow ATS criterion . They undergo spirometry reversibility testing , PC20 , skin prick test , exhale nitric oxide measurement induce sputum . They blood take PBMCs undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy obtention alveolar macrophage bronchial biopsy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1860 Physician diagnosis asthma Nonsevere asthmatic subject : mild moderately severe asthma . The group define follow , accord need treatment ( establish Asthma Management GINA BTS guideline ) : 1 . Mild : intermittent symptom need reliever bronchodilator less day 2. moderate asthma : wellcontrolled asthma minimal symptom inhale corticosteroid therapy exceed 2,000 μg beclomethasone equivalent . Severe asthmatic subject : least 1 major 2 minor criterion ( ) Major characteristic ( least one follow criterion ) Treatment continuous near continuous ( &gt; 50 % year ) oral corticosteroid Requirement treatment high dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) Minor characteristic ( least 2 follow ) 1 . Requirement daily treatment controller medication addition ICS e.g . LABA , theophylline , leukotriene antagonist 2 . Asthma symptoms require SABA daily near daily basis 3 . Persistent airways obstruction ( FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict , diurnal PEF variation &gt; 20 % ) 4 . One emergency care visit asthma per year 5 . 3 steroid `` burst '' per year 6 . Prompt deterioration ≤ 25 % reduction oral ICS 7 . Near fatal asthma event past Current smoker , less 3 year since quit smoking ( &lt; 5 pack/years ) Less 4 week exacerbation On steroidsparing agent immunosuppressant azathioprine , methotrexate ciclosporin Concomitant antiIgE therapy On antiplatelet anticoagulant drug Low platelet count Pregnancy breastfeed Intubation asthma within 6 month entry study ( undergoing bronchoscopy )</criteria>
