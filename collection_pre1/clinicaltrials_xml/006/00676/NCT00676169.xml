	<detailed_description>The EPIC Observational Study longitudinal , prospective , observational study originally conduct 59 site . The current five-year extension study conduct 54 site . The EPIC Observational Study serve freestanding epidemiologic study risk factor clinical impact initial Pa acquisition anti-pseudomonal therapy . Defining risk factor Pa acquisition potentially allow preventive measure identification high-risk population require closer monitoring . Despite rigorous data collection , previous study limit small sample size conduct one two center . This study include much large sample size many center previous study . It thus provide generalizable result precise risk estimate previously identify risk factor Pa acquisition , allow exploration novel risk factor include early study . Better understanding clinical outcome associate Pa acquisition outcomes associate different type anti-pseudomonal therapy inform development rational early intervention treatment regimen . Better knowledge temporal relationship respiratory sign symptom , Pa serology , CF airway microbiology may lead improved strategy early detection Pa could important implication time intervention aim prevent treat early Pa acquisition . Finally , study serve important source Pa S. aureus isolates , serum sample , DNA sample use banked study design enhance understanding pathogenesis CF , e.g. , microarray investigation early Pa isolates , investigation identify proteomic biomarkers airway inflammation , investigation identify genetic factor relate CF disease progression , include early lung disease , clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
