	<brief_title>A Study Enzyme Activity Safety Pancrelipase Patients With Severe Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancrelipase , active ingredient pancrelipase microtablet ( MT ) 21 capsule , pancreatic enzyme preparation ( PEP ) oral administration aid digestion fat , sugar protein . Approximately 20 men woman 18 85 year age enrol study . Patients enrol must severe pancreatic insufficiency steatorrhea ( presence fat stool result insufficient fat absorption digestive track ) due severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) , condition body unable digest food body digestive enzyme make pancreas digest fat , sugar proteins properly normal nutritional need . The study last approximately 25 day consist screen phase take place within 21 day open-label ( patient know identity treatment receive ) treatment phase consist 2 treatment period ( treatment period approximately 4 hour long ) , 2-day washout period treatment period , end-of-study evaluation upon successful completion sample collection treatment period 2 . Study participant arrive study center later 6 p.m. day treatment period 1 stay overnight study center end-of-study evaluation treatment period 2 ( approximately 5 day ) . During study , patient may consume food beverage contain alcohol , must refrain use methylxanthine-containing product , ( eg , chocolate bar beverage , coffee , tea , cola ) , must eat meal provide study reside study center , must refrain jogging , strenuous exercise type , sunbathe . At screen visit , patient ask sign inform consent form indicate understand purpose procedure require study willing participate study . Patients ask provide information regard medical history complete physical examination ( include heart respiration rate , blood pressure , temperature , height , weight ) perform . In addition , blood sample ( 10 mL approximately 2 teaspoon blood ) urine sample collect assess patient 's general health . A urine pregnancy test also perform woman childbearing age . If patient eligible participate study , he/she ask stop take exist pancreatic enzyme , prescription nonprescription medication ( include vitamin herbal supplement ) could affect stomach intestine 3 7 day return study center treatment period 1 2 . During study , patient receive either Treatment A Period 1 Treatment B Period 2 ; Treatment B Period 1 Treatment A Period 2 . The day ( Day -1 ) treatment period 1 , patient randomly ( chance ) assign 1 2 treatment sequence ( Treatment A Treatment B ) . Treatment A consist high-fat liquid meal ( 500 mL Ensure Plus contain 22.9 g fat ) . Treatment B consist 3 PANCREASE MT 21 capsule take orally ( mouth ) along high-fat liquid meal ( 500 mL Ensure Plus contain 22.9 g fat ) . Following overnight fast ( without eat ) least 10 hour , patient intubate ( ie , tube insert nose small intestine [ duodenum ] ) order collect sample fluid stomach intestine treatment treatment period 1 2 . In treatment period 1 , patient give study treatment ( Treatment A Treatment B ) orally ( mouth ) 20-25 minute period , follow 2-hour sample collection period . After sample completion period , intubation tube remove patient washout period least 48 hour rest receive treatment . At end washout period , patient enter treatment period 2 receive second study treatment . Patient 's may require stay overnight observation completion sample collection Period 2 , otherwise , patient permit leave study center Day 1 treatment period 2 follow physical examination collection blood urine sample safety assessment . The primary outcome study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( enzyme activity ) intraduodenal enzyme ( lipase , amylase , protease ) delivery single dose 3 pancrelipase MT 21 capsule gastric duodenal fluid sample collect patient treatment 15 minute interval 2 hour treatment Day 1 treatment period . During study , safety tolerability study drug monitor time screening ( Day -21 ) end study procedure perform Day 1 treatment period 2 evaluate adverse event ( side effect ) , result clinical laboratory test ( serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , body temperature ) measurement , finding physical examination report . Adverse event report patient also monitor 30 day follow discharge study center . On Day 1 first treatment period , patient receive Treatment A ( high-fat liquid meal 500 ml Ensure Plus ) OR Treatment B ( 3 pancrelipase microtablet ( MT ) 21 capsule take orally mouth addition high-fat liquid meal 500 ml Ensure Plus ) ingest within 20-25 minute . After 2-day washout period , second treatment period , patient receive Treatment A period 1 receive Treatment B patient receive Treatment B receive Treatment A .</detailed_description>
