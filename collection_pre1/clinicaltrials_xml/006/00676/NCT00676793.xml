	<brief_title>A Study Effect Polyphenon E ( Green Tea Extract ) Breast Cancer Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate short-term effect daily dose Polyphenon E administer interval breast biopsy surgery woman recently diagnose breast cancer . Endpoints change serum tissue biomarkers related progression cancer . The effect Polyphenon E tumor cell c-Met expression phosphorylation primary objective . Secondary objective include effect tissue serum biomarkers . Evaluation safety tolerability Polyphenon E subject population another objective . 1.1 Determine effect Polyphenon E tumor cell c-Met expression phosphorylation level patient breast cancer 1.2 Determine effect Polyphenon E PI-3K activation patient breast cancer 1.3 Determine effect Polyphenon E MAPK activation patient breast cancer 1.4 Determine effect Polyphenon E expression level proteins involve motility invasion Rho GTPases extracellular proteinase patient breast cancer 1.5 Determine effect Polyphenon E marker angiogenesis patient breast cancer 1.6 Determine effect Polyphenon E serum marker : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Insulin-Like Growth factor I ( IGF-I ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) Hepatocyte Growth Factor HGF 1.7 Evaluate safety tolerability Polyphenon E subject population</detailed_description>
