	<brief_summary>To investigate compare efficacy , safety tolerability ziprasidone versus placebo treatment conduct disorder ( CD ) , oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) disruptive behavior disorder otherwise specify ( DBD-NOS ) old child adolescent outpatient set . Conduct behavior disorder common form psychopathology child adolescent . The main characteristic disorder repetitive persistent pattern antisocial , aggressive defiant behavior involve major violation age-appropriate expectation norm . According guideline German Society Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry &amp; Psychotherapy ( Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und -psychotherapie DGKJPP ) , European Society Child Adolescent Psychiatry ( ESCAP ) , American Academy Child Adolescent Psychiatry ( AACAP ) currently standard pharmacotherapy establish recommend child adolescent .

	<detailed_description>Trial Design : A placebo-controlled , parallel-group , randomize , double-blind , single center design include 3-weekly baseline period find best individual dose , 6-weeks treatment period 2-weeks washout period . Study Agent / Placebo - Dosage Route Administration : Study medication first dispense Visit 2 ( day 1 ) . Treatment assignment make accordance randomization sequence . At medication visit ( Visit 2 Visit 7 ) , subject receive one bottle follow week ( Visit 2 Visit 4 ) resp . follow two week ( Visit 5 Visit 7 ) . Only qualified personnel may dispense study medication . The study population randomize equally verum placebo group Visit 2 . All patient receive initial oral course start 5mg/d Ziprasidone Hydrochloride placebo patient body weight ≤ 50 kg 10 mg/d Ziprasidone Hydrochloride placebo patient body weight &gt; 50 kg first week study . At Visit 3 therapist increase dose double initial dose accord clinical response tolerability . At Visit 4 dose increase double last dose reduce initial dose . At Visit 5 effective best tolerate dose give 6 week fix dose phase trial . Therefore maximum daily dose 20 mg ( patient body weight ≤ 50 kg ) 40 mg ( patient body weight &gt; 50 kg ) . The total dose split half-dose give twice day ( morning evening ) . Planned Study Time Schedule : The study end 11 week enrollment last patient ( total study end ) . Study duration patient 11 week ( inclusion ) last visit ( close-out visit ) . Patients pre-treatment psychotropic drug individual washout period inclusion study . This individual washout period last 5 elimination half-life take drug . After randomization patient enter 3 week dose escalation phase weekly visit . Then 6 week stable drug dose phase follow visit every second week , follow two week washout period final visit . Statistics : Sample size calculation : Sample size calculation base assumption treatment Ziprasidone show effect size ES=1 compare treatment placebo . In order demonstrate difference significance level 5 % power 80 % , 17 patient per group require , drop-out rate approximately 8 patient per group ( data available analyzed accord intention-to-treat principle ) must account . Analysis efficacy : The trial analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . The effect treatment Ziprasidone assess analyze change score scale describe . Changes calculate evaluation treatment analyze mean analysis covariance , consider baseline measurement covariate . The difference treatment group estimate 95 % confidence interval test within model correspond two-sided test 5 % level significance . Analysis safety : Safety analysis perform patient receive least one dose investigational drug . Rates adverse event serious adverse event calculate correspond 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
