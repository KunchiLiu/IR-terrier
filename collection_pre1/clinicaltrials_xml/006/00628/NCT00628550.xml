	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest poor prognosis , especially prolonged effort resuscitation , unfortunately , survivor often severely neurologically impaired . CPA child often result prolonged illness rather sudden , primary cardiac event frequent adult . This necessitate resuscitation research must conduct separately pediatric adult patient . Authorities currently endorse use epinephrine restore spontaneous circulation base ability maintain diastolic blood pressure subsequent blood flow heart resuscitation . However , human study show clear survival benefit epinephrine elucidate concern adverse effect . Recently , European Resuscitation Council American Heart Association recognize use vasopressin promise vasoconstrictor alternative adjunct epinephrine resuscitation adult . Vasopressin cause profound vasoconstriction without adverse effect epinephrine associate improved blood flow heart brain . This increase cerebral blood flow associate good neurologic outcome animal study . In light compel animal human study combine vasopressin epinephrine , pediatric trial indicate vasopressin usage pediatric CPR . This study evaluate addition administration vasopressin standard advance CPR therapy ( epinephrine alone ) pediatric patient experience in-intensive care unit CPA assess improve time return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) , survival 24 hour , survival hospital discharge , neurologic outcome . When patient experience CPA , standard Pediatric Advanced Life Saving ( PALS ) protocols endorsed American Heart Association initiate . This include receive epinephrine first vasopressor medication . Patients randomize receive vasopressin ( treatment group ) epinephrine ( control group ) second vasopressor medication , need . If two dos vasopressor medication require either group , epinephrine administer accord PALS algorithm end event . All CPA event meet inclusion criterion enter National Registry Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( NRCPR ) Database , tracts CPA event Children 's Medical Center Dallas . Prior commencement RCT , pilot trial 10 patient complete assess preliminary safety , feasibility , effectiveness combination epinephrine-vasopressin pediatric in-intensive care unit CPA refractory initial epinephrine dosing .

	<brief_title>Trial Vasopressin Epinephrine Epinephrine Only In-Hospital Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONCISE SUMMARY OF PROJECT : The study design prospective , randomize , control clinical trial conduct PICU CMC Dallas ( UT Southwestern Medical Center ) follow pilot trial enrol 10 patient . This study undertaken consultation acceptance resuscitation committee PICU CMC . Pediatric patient experience in-hospital CPA remain cardiac arrest despite CPR initial , standard dose epinephrine ( 0.01 mg/kg ) , randomly assign receive either standard dose epinephrine ( 0.01 mg/kg ) vasopressin ( 0.8 units/kg ) rescue second vasopressor medication . SUMMARY OF STUDY PROCEDURES : When patient experience CPA , standard Pediatric Advanced Life Saving ( PALS ) protocols follow . This include : establishment airway , support breathe include supplemental oxygen , evaluation cardiac rhythm , chest compression , electrical defibrillation appropriate , administration epinephrine first vasopressor medication . The quality CPR monitor report document nurse event , include rate ventilation , rate depth chest compression , no-flow time ( time without chest compression ) . In addition , monitor end-tidal CO2 , diastolic blood pressure via arterial line present , human observation coach employ track CPR quality . The patient randomize receive either epinephrine ( control group ) vasopressin ( treatment group ) second vasopressor medication need . If dos medication require either group , epinephrine administer accord PALS algorithm end CPA event define . Thus , difference group replacement epinephrine vasopressin second vasopressor medication algorithm . A total 120 patient enrol randomize , control trial portion study . After completion PICU staff train prior randomize , control trial , pilot trial vasopressin resuscitation involve 10 patient conducted test feasibility safety study methodology . Pilot participant meet inclusion criterion enrol serially PICU CMC . Study protocol treatment group randomize , control trial ( vasopressin + epinephrine ) follow . Collected information review member Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) proceed next phase trial . These patient include final analysis . The requirement two dos resuscitation medication provide adequate time randomization use vasopressin . It also exclude child rapidly reversible condition would time benefit vasopressin versus epinephrine intervention . Stratified randomization technique use control effect vasopressor infusion patient receive time cardiac arrest . Stratification base 4 group i.e. , epinephrine , vasopressin , , neither . In order avoid extreme imbalance size treatment arm , permute block design use size block set 6 . SPSS pseudo-random number generator use design randomization chart . Randomization accomplish PICU pharmacist via sealed envelope designate study arm assignment available every code cart PICU . Thus , study medication blind pharmacist . On admission PICU , family patient inform educate ongoing study exception inform consent ( EFIC ) via poster wait room brochure regard study clearly explain `` opt '' inclusion . The number patient `` opt '' inclusion document available IRB request . Representatives study available phone 24 hour day person wait room daily discuss study answer question . Parents informed inclusion within 24 hour person phone letter unavailable . This notification document consent elicit follow data collection . CPA event limit occur PICU . Providers respond CPA event in-serviced regard study protocol prior implementation via didactic session . Input pharmacists provider PICU seek assure easy implementation possible . Vasopressin currently available administration resuscitation ( code ) cart CMC . Inclusion exclusion criterion post code cart assist provider . Current protocol CMC enter CPA event National Registry Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( NRCPR ) follow . This data complete account event CPA sufficient meet study 's state goal objective . Only data pertinent outcome study review database . This data also review assure standardization execution study protocol . Time Completion Given 89 CPA event meet inclusion criterion January 2005 June 2006 PICU CMC , approximately 30 month require enroll 130 total patient study ( 10 patient pilot trial , 120 patient main study ) . Subjects enrol study discharge in-hospital death . Definition CPA End Event 1. . ROSC sustain &gt; 20mins need chest compression , include pacemaker extracorporeal membrane oxygenation OR 2. . Resuscitation event terminate patient declare dead ( unresponsive advance life support , medical futility , advance directive , restriction family member ) SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS : A full resuscitation team present whenever vasopressin administer include physician , nurse , respiratory technician , clinical technician , pharmacist . A sign clearly post bed patient whose proxy `` opt '' patient study meet exclusion criterion . The DSMB evaluate study clear benefit harm , lack efficacy , unacceptable toxicity vasopressin . SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIALS/ COLLECTION OF FOLLOW UP DATA : Data CPA event collect NRCPR database complete conclusion every CPA event currently CMC . Data collect six major category variable : ( 1 ) Facility data , ( 2 ) Patient demographic data , ( 3 ) Pre-event data , ( 4 ) Event data , ( 5 ) Outcome data , ( 6 ) Quality improvement data . All patient identifier destroy early possible opportunity . Data de-identified analysis . This data include laboratory treatment data hospitalization PICU CMC , , resuscitation . Specifically , data include : age , gender , vital sign , treatment , laboratory result , neurologic exam ( PCPC POPC score ) physical exam . The data collection base in-hospital Utstein-style guideline .</detailed_description>
