	<brief_summary>This research study cell use somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) , and/or genetic reprogramming research may result production stem cell line . This study provide treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Create Potential Cell-Based Therapies Treat Human Disease Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It think study genetic reprogramming SCNT use human cell potential give u new basic knowledge human development . Current work focus develop basic knowledge . In future , human embryonic stem cell line ( hESC ) derive genetic reprogramming SCNT may also potential develop cell type useful cell-based therapy treat human disease disability .</detailed_description>
