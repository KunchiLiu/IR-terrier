	<brief_summary>Patients sustain broken low jaw traditionally treat one three way . The first involve teeth jaw wire together period 4 6 week order allow break jaw heal . The second third way involve surgical procedure require expose broken bone stabilize metal plate screw allow patient able function relatively normally heal period . One surgical method use small plate screw alternate method use large plate screw . Currently two school think respect plate screw use . One group support use large rigid plate due increase strength plate . The use large strong plate principle behind AO technique , originally develop 1970 's Switzerland popular technique USA . The group support use small plate screw must place certain anatomical position allow natural muscular force exist jaw stabilize break facilitate complete heal broken bone . This technique develop France Maxime Champy 1970 's standard care throughout Australasia part Europe . This technique simpler , quick cheap . The need patient maintain diet soft food consider many important success less rigid small plate go use . Many critic Champy technique feel less compliant patient population might see county hospital make technique less readily suit population . This contrary publish data Europe , Australia recently USA . The question interest whether small plate screw equally effective treatment break low jaw urban county hospital ? If equally effective , benefit term fewer patient complication decrease health cost ? If small plate screw adequate , modification original Champy technique improve usefulness ? Patients present broken low jaw require surgery treat one three way . Some patient treat large plate screw attend surgeon routinely use large plate screw break low jaw . Another group patient treat small plate screw use Champy principle . A third group patient also treat small plate screw use modification original Champy technique involve use additional small plate screw add stability . Patients follow three month period evaluate heal break jaw . The three technique compare . Larger plates/ screw small plates/ screw standard care . Regional difference throughout USA continue ensure difference opinion regard technique well although historically large plates/screws popular USA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Champy Versus AO Mandible Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient ORIF fracture mandible general anesthesia . Patients either treat small 2 mm plate screw accord Champy principle ( modify Champy technique utilize additional 2mm plates/screws ) large plates/screws ( 2.3mm large ) accord AO principle . No patient teeth wire together patient able function normally . All patient immediate post operative orthopantogram verify adequacy fracture reduction . Patients discharge soon medically appropriate . Patient Assessment Patients assess regularly 1 week , 3 week , 6 week 3 month ensure continue healing fracture . This typical post-operative follow-up schedule fracture patient . As standard care , orthopantogram x-ray take 6 week 3 month assess fracture heal . Additional x-ray take clinical picture suggestive inadequate heal infection . Additional data regard presence infection , nonunion , fibrous union , malunion , malocclusion , facial nerve weakness inferior alveolar nerve paresthesia record follow-up visit . Additional complication also record manage necessary .</detailed_description>
