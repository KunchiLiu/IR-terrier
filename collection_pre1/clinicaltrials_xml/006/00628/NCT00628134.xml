	<brief_summary>Inhaled medication often use treat lung diseases cystic fibrosis . We perform study determine whether inhaled medication dissolve surfactant-based solution distribute evenly throughout lung compare standard saline-based solution . We think inhale medication surfactant-based liquid result medication reach partially block part lung . This study use special nuclear medicine test call aerosol deposition scan compare drug spread lung use surfactant-based aerosol compare saline-based aerosol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) inherit chronic disease affect lung digestive system 30,000 child adult United States ( 70,000 worldwide ) . The lung person cystic fibrosis often contain thick sticky mucus clog lung lead life-threatening lung infection . A major milestone treatment CF development inhale form antibiotic drug call tobramycin . For inhaled antibiotic work must deliver infected part lung . Many study show blockage lung , like find CF patient , prevent inhale medicine reach part lung . Usually aerosolized medication dissolve saline water . Most medication could dissolve surfactant solution aerosolize . Soaps common example surfactant . Surfactants may ability spread medication inside surface lung similar way dish soap spread water . We think inhale medication surfactant-based liquid result medication reach partially block part lung . We believe normal movement lung associate breathe spread surfactant-based aerosol medication , contribute even even drug distribution long period time . A surfactant-based inhaled antibiotic would potential reach site infection lung , possibly get rid infection together . This study use special test call aerosol deposition scan compare drug spread lung use surfactant-based aerosol compare saline-based aerosol . The study include one screening two test visit .</detailed_description>

Subjects receive treatment diagnostic procedure involve radioisotope within last 30 day . Subjects CF arm study also exclude prestudy pulmonary function test ( FEV1 ) 15 % depress last baseline pulmonary function test , baseline value within last 6 month , experience exacerbation require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic within last month .</criteria>
