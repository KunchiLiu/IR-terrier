	<detailed_description>Upon obtain informed consent , patient begin two course oral cyclophosphamide topotecan x 14 day . During first two course , patient perform 14C-Erythromycin Breath Test topotecan pharmacokinetics perform day 1 14 . The subject also various medical test procedure perform part regular cancer care include : Medical history physical examination do weekly , blood test do weekly , heart kidney function test , various scan do two course treatment , pregnancy test female childbearing age do prior start treatment . Patients may continue receive additional course oral cyclophosphamide topotecan provide experience tumor progression intolerable side effect .</detailed_description>
