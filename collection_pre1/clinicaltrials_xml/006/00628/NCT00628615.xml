	<brief_summary>Rationale : The sensation need urination ( urge ) complex partially understood mechanism . It hypothesis mechanism disrupt patient suffer overactive bladder syndrome . The Overactive Bladder syndrome ( OAB ) define spectrum symptom incontinence may may overlap urgency , frequency nocturia . This syndrome estimate affect approximately 17 % adult population Europe United States . The symptom overactive bladder many potential cause contribute factor . One factor outlet obstruction bladder due benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . Nowadays antimuscarinic drug use treatment overactive bladder . Antimuscarinic agent proven work slightly moderately well placebo 's associated side effect dry mouth , blur vision constipation . Many patient low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) develop OAB . In group patient LUTS OAB , always clear obstruction find . So , least patient , LUTS , must another reason OAB obstruction . The autonomous bladder activity introduce , among others Maastricht Urology research group . In animal model , bladder show rhythmic low amplitude contraction ( micro motion ) . It hypothesize activity sensory function micturation regulation system mainly locate bladder wall . These call micromotions never demonstrate human bladder . The sense function bladder micturation reflex remain mainly unclear . We hypothesise disregulation autonomous bladder activity ( micro motion ) patient OAB . We want explore study relationship OAB , obstruction micro motion order gain well understanding bladder ( patho ) physiology . reason This turn , help u quest well treatment strategy patient suffer OAB . Objective : The study divide two distinct group male female group : The male group consist patient low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . The female group consist patient overactive bladder syndrome OAB . The primary objective pilot experiment describe via observational study relation non-micturation bladder activity sensation fill phase bladder woman . We want explore relation non-micturation bladder activity sensation urgency fill phase . Furthermore men , want study relationship non-micturation bladder activity amount obstruction . We would also like visualize micro motion bladder men woman fill phase study influence ( visual cognitive ) stimuli bladder activity . We want explore relation non-micturation bladder activity sensation urgency fill phase male patient Lower urinary tract symptom . In order gain well understanding bladder ( patho ) physiology . Study design : A pilot observational study describe non-micturation bladder activity sensation measurement fill phase . Study population : The study population consist two group . First group patient ( female ) undergo ambulatory urodynamic investigation investigate bladder complaint . All patient older 18 year . The second group consist male patient undergo conventional urodynamic investigation normal work lower urinary tract symptom . All patient older 18 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Micturation Bladder Activity Relation Self-Consciousness During Filling Phase Sensation Measurement During Filling Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Importance problem : Incontinence , increase urge increase frequency micturition affect nearly 100 million people western world 1,2 ( 33 million US 66 million European Union ) . These condition life threaten seriously affect quality life ability work . OAB study report incidence 17 % western population great consequence quality life . The low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) prevalent old population , 40 % age 70 year affect . Therefore , LUTS represent major problem individual , health profession society . Importantly , people generally live longer , number affect LUTS increase . Economic cost : The total economic cost group condition high . In 2002 cost US approximately $ 12.7 billion1 ( estimate $ 17 billion â‚¬22 billion/year 2005 ) . Approximately 25 % expenditure spend treatment ( drug therapy , clinical consultation surgery ) . Of suffer 28 % seek help half currently receive treatment . Less 3 % regain long lasting normal control . Therefore , cost under-estimate problem large . Aetiology : The primary clinical problem overactive bladder syndrome increase urge pas urine , without incontinence . Remarkably , despite prevalence cost involve , mechanisms underlie increased urge know . In order simply describe condition term 'Over Active Bladder ( OAB ) Symptom Complex ' introduce . In many case , study use conventional urodynamics , sensation urge correlated rise intra-vesical pressure , condition classify detrusor activity ( DO ) . In remainder patient , sensation accompany pressure change condition describe bladder activity ( BO ) , previously describe sensory urgency . These difference relationship sensation bladder activity may indicative different clinical state . However , likely n't yet understand nature clinical condition . Lower urinary tract symptom mostly cause obstruction often cause benign prostatic hypertrophia ( BPH ) . The study conduct among two distinct group . male female group . The Female group : In female group patient ask describe complaint standard ambulatory urodynamic investigation take place . Patients ask spend one hour six hour time normal time ambulatory urodynamics u clinic . During time patient ask sit stand right answer question bladder sensation . Normally patient free go home study woman ask spend first hour clinic . Patients ask fill self-consciousness questionnaire period around urodynamic measurement . They measurement home . This take 10 minute . Patients also ask think answer question show computer screen , urodynamic measurement . They also show picture , e.g . toilet landscape picture . After obtain informed consent , begin normal procedure ambulatory urodynamic measurement vesical catheter insert patient purpose ambulatory urodynamic measurement connect sensitive measuring device ( PASAQ ) 601 certification , design IDDEE department Maastricht university approve Maastricht university hospital technical department . ( Mr. Frank Meeuwissen ) . The bladder patient fill physiologically kidneys drink fluid , measure high sensibility , try study small bladder contraction . At interval 15 minute patient show computer screen 2 question write . ( e.g . Do desire void ? ) patient need answer question . We hypothesize think question trigger small bladder contraction allow brain , feel ' bladder filling . The patient also show picture ( e.g . toilet landscape picture ) order assess effect , difference visual stimulus bladder contraction . The male group : In study male patient undergoing standard stationary urodynamic measurement normal diagnostic work lower Urinary tract symptom ask take part study . This mean measurement take 10 minute ask fill questionnaire . There extra catheter insertion invasive measurement add normal procedure conventional urodynamic measurement undergo symptom . Patients ask fill self-consciousness questionnaire period around urodynamic measurement . They measurement home . This take 10 minute . Patients also ask think answer question show computer screen , urodynamic measurement . They also show picture , e.g . toilet landscape picture . We want study effect visual cognitive stimulus bladder contraction . After obtain informed consent , end normal procedure conventional urodynamic measurement vesical catheter remain patient ten minute longer . This catheter connect sensitive measuring device ( PASAQ ) 601 certification , design IDDEE department Maastricht university approve Maastricht university hospital technical department . ( Mr. Frank Meeuwissen ) . The bladder patient fill like normal urodynamic measurement 3 different filling , 100 , 200 300 ml . At fill amount , pomp stop 2 minute measure high sensibility , try study small bladder contraction . At 300 ml fill patient show computer screen 2 question write . ( e.g . Do desire void ? ) patient need answer question . We hypothesise think question trigger small bladder contraction allow brain , feel ' bladder filling . The patient also show picture ( e.g . toilet landscape picture ) order assess effect , difference visual stimulus bladder contraction . Main study parameters/endpoints : In female group main study parameter characterize non-micturition activity bladder fill relation visual cognitive stimulus . This new high definition device allow u measure small delicate change bladder pressure allow u relate activity bladder volume sensation , determine nature change activity associate OAB . The secondary study parameter identify possible mechanism underlie OAB , explore possibility therapeutically important drug OAB exert action via inhibition non-micturition activity The main study parameter male group characterize non-micturition activity bladder filling , relate activity bladder volume sensation , determine nature change activity associate OAB ass relationship OAB symptoms amount obstruction . The secondary study parameter identify possible mechanism underlie OAB , explore possibility therapeutically important drug OAB exert action via inhibition non-micturition activity . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients participate study expose serious adverse event side effect . The investigation undergo normal workup complaint take ten minute longer . The patient ask fill extra question list call self-consciousness questionnaire . Patients benefit study directly , helpful get information non-micturation activity relation sensation . The result hopefully lead well understanding normal pathological bladder .</detailed_description>
