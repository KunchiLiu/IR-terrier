	<brief_summary>Preliminary study suggest response antidepressant medication accelerate target insomnia adjunctive use eszopiclone . It yet know mechanism ( ) support acceleration response , though preliminary finding support hypothesis early restoration sleep may facilitate BDNF-based effect antidepressant medication . The optimal duration co-treatment also unknown . This study test specific hypotheses brain mechanism evaluate effect continue eszopiclone beyond time window response acceleration observe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Mechanisms Targeting Insomnia Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A critical challenge management major depressive disorder ( MDD ) delay initiate treatment antidepressant medication clinical improvement . Preliminary study ( Fava et al. , 2006 ; Krystal et al. , 2007 ) suggest target insomnia eszopiclone ( ESZ ) patient receive fluoxetine may lead rapid resolution symptom . Studies yet able differentiate compete explanation phenomenon : whether co-treatment ESZ actually accelerate change brain associate antidepressant treatment response , effect insomnia component confine symptomatic level ( `` masking '' ) . As non-benzodiazepine GABA-receptor agonist FDA approval long-term use treatment sleep disturbance , ESZ appropriate agent target insomnia MDD without major concern around development tolerance . Further research co-treatment would advance understanding mechanism ( ) underlie accelerate improvement . Our prior work ( Cook et al. , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 ; Leuchter et al . 2002 ) study new physiologic biomarker response SSRI mixed-action antidepressant . The EEG-based cordance biomarker detect physiologic effect successful antidepressant treatment 48 hour , 1 week , 2 week treatment ; contrast , symptom difference responder non-responders separate 4 week treatment placebo-controlled trial . Additionally , magnitude early physiologic change associate completeness clinical response . Our biomarker independently study finding replicate ( Bareš et al. , 2007 ) . The cordance biomarker consider leading indicator predictor treatment outcome . As non-invasive probe brain physiology , may detect early neurophysiologic change associate accelerate clinical response eszopiclone . Other research report brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) reduce many patient MDD ( Karege et al. , 2002 , 2005 , Shimizu et al. , 2003 ) may rise course treatment antidepressant medication ( e.g. , Gonul et al. , 2005 ; Yoshimura et al. , 2007 ; Huang et al. , 2007 ) . BDNF-related neuroplasticity suggest mechanism medication lead mood improvement ( Duman 2002 ; Manji et al. , 2003 ) . Sleep pattern also show impact neuroplasticity ( Taishi et al. , 2001 ; cf . Benington &amp; Frank , 2003 ) . A simple acute phase-shift sleep impact BDNF level ( Sei 2003 ) , suggest link sleep symptomatic recovery depression might operate via BDNF mechanism reflect change brain physiology . While Krystal colleague ( 2007 ) previously report beneficial clinical effect 8 week co-treatment diminish significantly two week follow ESZ discontinuation , control study examine outcomes clinically-likely scenario employ short co-treatment period ( e.g. , 4 week , much acceleration occur ) . Based previous study , study ass patient MDD treatment SSRI antidepressant , escitalopram ( ESC ) , administer along either ESZ placebo ( PBO ) , use ( ) clinical symptom rating , ( b ) serum level BDNF , ( c ) cognitive function , ( ) brain physiology EEG .</detailed_description>
