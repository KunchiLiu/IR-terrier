	<brief_summary>The study look new treatment wrist finger contracture -- condition affect hand `` close '' position , wrist finger stiff difficult move position . We want study stimulation wrist finger muscle use implanted neuromuscular stimulator ( BION ) less effective passive exercise affect hand improve range movement wrist finger joint . Subjects study randomize one three group : one passive movement therapy ; one receive surface stimulation ( electrical stimulation electrode skin arm ) one BION® therapy . The passive movement group therapy 12 week . Subjects either stimulation group receive stimulation 6 week passive therapy 6 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BION™ Experimental Group Following implantation , patient receive BIONs 3 7 day heal period . During period , subject receive active therapy . At end heal period , subject come test center examiner program exercise pattern . They instruct increase strength muscle contraction tolerance permit . The goal BION™ patient achieve 30 minute stimulation twice daily , use cycle stimulation frequency adequate produce tetanic contraction , ( typically 25-35 pps ) raise joint full range motion gravity ( range grade 3/5 ) base available range motion . The intensity , duration frequency exercise program modify accord progress participant , strength contraction increase time . Surface Stimulation Group Patients instruct stimulate twice daily 30 minute surface electrode place accord instruction subject give . Stimulus parameter similar report earlier successful stimulation study . The parameter achieve tetanic contraction raise joint full range motion gravity ( graded 3/5 ) base patient 's available range motion , cycle , typically 25-35 pps , use stimulus ramp necessary contraction smoothly grade comfortable . Every effort make ensure parameter need group choose produce similar type contraction obtain BION™ stimulation . Control Group conservative therapy ( Range motion exercise ) The research participant instruct self-administered , standard range motion stretch exercise . If patient unable stretch finger extension , family member care-giver instructed assist . They instruct exercise affected hand twice daily , repeat exercise minimum 15 time session 6 week . Control subject return clinic every two week first 6 week every 3 week follow-up period . During visit , passive range motion test administer .</detailed_description>
