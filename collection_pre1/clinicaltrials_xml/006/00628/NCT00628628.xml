	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : To determine efficacy rasburicase administer single dose follow need dosing ( investigational arm ) compare fix dose 5 day ( standard treatment arm ) treatment patient high risk potential risk tumor lysis syndrome . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate plasma uric acid area curve ( AUC ) baseline 7 day 2 . To evaluate incidence renal insufficiency electrolyte abnormality . 3 . To determine safety immunogenicity rasburicase . 4 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness experimental treatment ( investigational arm ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drug TLS Rasburicase design help decrease prevent high level uric acid may occur start chemotherapy . A high level uric acid blood may lead decreased kidney function kidney failure . TLS occur high uric acid level cause breakdown tumor cell start chemotherapy . The dead tumor cell release uric acid cause symptom kidney failure , release large amount potassium phosphorus ( chemical ) blood . Screening Tests Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . Blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( use sample routine blood draw ) urine pregnancy test . Study Groups If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . There equal chance either group . Group A Participants Group A receive rasburicase vein , 30 minute , Day 1 Cycle 1 chemotherapy . On Days 1-7 Cycle 1 chemotherapy , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include check level uric acid blood . During Days 2-5 Cycle 1 chemotherapy , receive rasburicase ( day ) level uric acid high day . Group B Participants Group B receive rasburicase vein , 30 minute , day Days 1-5 Cycle 1 chemotherapy . On Days 1-7 Cycle 1 chemotherapy , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include check level uric acid blood . Both Groups Treatment rasburicase give Cycle 1 chemotherapy . The chemotherapy give least 4 hour ( 24 hour ) first dose rasburicase . Length Study When blood test result show antibodies rasburicase , participation study . You take study TLS get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Rasburicase commercially available , FDA approve treat TLS . It FDA approve pediatric patient leukemia , lymphoma , solid tumor cancer receive anti-cancer therapy expect increase blood level uric acid ( result cancer cell die treatment ) . For treat TLS adult patient , authorize use research . Up 80 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients hematological malignancy ( leukemia/lymphoma ) high risk potential risk tumor lysis syndrome . High risk : hyperuricemia malignancy ( Uric acid level &gt; 7.5 ) ; diagnosis aggressive lymphoma/leukemia base Revised EuropeanAmerican Lymphoma ( REAL ) classification ; acute myeloid leukemia , chronic myelocytic leukemia ( CML ) blast crisis ; high grade myelodysplastic syndrome &gt; 10 % bone marrow blast involvement give aggressive treatment similar acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( continued # 2 ) 2 . ( continued # 1 ) Potential risk : diagnosis aggressive lymphoma/leukemia base ( REAL ) classification . Plus one follow criterion : lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) &gt; /= 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Stage IIIIV disease ; Stage III disease least 1 lymph node/tumor &gt; 5cm diameter . 3 . ECOG performance status 03 4 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month 5 . Negative pregnancy test ( female child bear potential ) within &lt; /=2 week rasburicase dose use efficient contraceptive method ( male female ) . Pregnancy test may perform serum ( HCG ) urine ( HCG ) 6 . Signed write inform consent ( approved Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ) obtain prior study entry 1 . Patient receive investigational drug hyperuricemia within 30 day plan first treatment rasburicase 2 . Pregnancy lactation 3 .
