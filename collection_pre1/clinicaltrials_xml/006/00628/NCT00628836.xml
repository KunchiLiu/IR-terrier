	<brief_summary>The study look treatment reverse chronic shoulder subluxation stroke . It compare electrical stimulation surface electrode ( stimulation skin ) intra-muscular stimulation ( inside muscle ) use implant micro-stimulator ( BION ) . Subjects put either surface stimulation BION® group . In BION® group , two BION®s implant shoulder , medial deltoid supraspinatus muscle . Treatment consist baseline 6 week , 6 week therapy , consist 2 session per day 10 30 minute time . This follow 6 week without therapy . If test show 6 week therapy reversal subluxation , intense therapy carry another 6 week . Treatment similar surface electrode group , surface electrode deliver stimulation instead BION®s . A total 30 subject expect complete study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BION™ novel implantable neuromuscular stimulator whose intend use study reanimate shoulder muscle stroke survivor shoulder subluxation . Strokes consider important cause adult disability North America , 500,000 new case per year U.S. ( National Stroke Association ) 45,000 Canada ( Langton-Hewer , 1990 ; Shuaib &amp; Hachinski , 1991 ) . Three-quarters patient survive half survivor substantial muscle weakness 6 month ( Gresham et al. , 1979 ) little chance spontaneous recovery ( Anderson , 1990 ; Bonita &amp; Beaglehole , 1988 ) . The commonly affected region early phase recovery shoulder ; 80 % hemiplegic stroke patient suffer shoulder subluxation associate chronic pain ( Smith et al. , 1980 ) . The shoulder muscle normally active tonically flaccidly paralyze ; weight pendant arm gradually stretch damage atrophic muscle ligament , allow head humerus descend glenoid fossa . This result chronic shoulder pain difficult treat tends obstruct physical therapy direct toward regain use paretic arm . Our hypothesis electrical stimulation deliver BIONs fundamentally equivalent muscle activation achieve voluntarily transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , BIONs prove clinically acceptable effective approach . The BION system consist BION implant , controller operate study participant , fit hardware software use clinician implant , test , program BION function . In study , BION use reanimate shoulder muscle stroke survivor experience shoulder subluxation . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy intramuscular stimulation BIONs correct establish , symptomatic shoulder subluxation chronic stroke survivor . The result intramuscular stimulation BIONs compare result treatment conventional therapy : surface stimulation . Degree shoulder subluxation primary outcome measure study . We include ( secondary ) outcome measure ( i.e. , muscle strength , range motion , functional activity , spasticity/tone , subject satisfaction pain ) may reveal secondary benefit treatment BIONs . The investigation expect last 21 week study participant . The study complete 5-year period .</detailed_description>
