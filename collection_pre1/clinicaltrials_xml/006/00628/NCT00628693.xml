	<brief_summary>The design protocol prospective observational study objectively measure rate , depth quality chest compression ventilation deliver cardiac arrest Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) Emergency Department ( ED ) setting utilize MRx/Q-CPR . The data collect analyzed several purpose - comparison current American Heart Association ( AHA ) Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) guideline determine chest wall stiffness CPR modeling effort construction biofidelic manikins test dummy CPR auto safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative Measurement Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) During In Hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) guideline recommend target value select CPR parameter related rate depth chest compression ventilation , avoidance CPR-free interval . Recent study adult patient however show rescuer often adhere guideline . There currently little data quality CPR perform pediatric patient , give close similarity therapy expect adherence Guidelines suboptimal patient group well . Feedback quality chest compression ventilation deliver CPR frequently guide subjective `` code leader '' , objective measurement . Quantitative system provide CPR feedback demonstrate improvement adult patient treatment . Based study , feedback system ( termed Quality CPR Q-CPR system ) improve new device call Heartstart MRx Q-CPR option ( MRx/Q-CPR ) . These device approve FDA use patient &gt; 8 year . The MRX/Q-CPR , attach cord defibrillator/monitor , detects , display record rate , force depth compression accelerometer force transducer inside compression pad . These device currently approve CHOP Resuscitation Committee Medical device committee clinical implementation CHOP Intensive Care unit ( ICU ) Emergency Department ( ED ) . Objectives : The goal study record analyze data MRx/Q-CPR in-hospital cardiac arrest child &gt; 8 year two research objective . The primary research objective evaluate rate , depth , quality chest compression ventilation deliver child in-hospital CPR . A secondary research objective determine chest wall stiffness child order improve quantitative CPR modeling effort facilitate construction biofidelic pediatric manikin CPR simulation test dummy automotive safety</detailed_description>
