	<brief_summary>A control , randomize study treatment schizophrenic psychosis cannabidiol , phytocannabinoid perform . This approach base upon recent finding indicate human endogenous cannabinoid system significantly involve pathogenesis schizophrenia . Our group show , example , Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) able provoke schizophrenia-like psychotic symptom healthy volunteer . This , well capability Δ9-THC exacerbate productive psychotic symptom schizophrenic patient , recently confirm others . Furthermore , find en-dogenous brain constituent anandamide , endogenous Δ9-THC agonist , significantly elevate CSF schizophrenic patient . Cannabinergic substance anandamide may enhance dopaminergic neurotrans-mission increase dopamine turnover . They may also influence onset course schizophrenia yet unidentified mechanism We seek investigate efficacy cannabidiol treatment schizophrenic schizophreniform psy-choses , evidence CB1 antagonists SR141716 cannabidiol antipsychotic effect comparable classic neuroleptic drug . Furthermore , cannabidiol well tolerated show side effect human . Cannabidiol may serve antipsychotic medication primarily base upon antidopaminergic upon different mechanism , especially anticannabinergic one . It may therefore effec-tive medication least subgroup schizophrenic schizophreniform patient may expect show additional anxiolytic effect minor side effect . The control condition parallel design establish neuroleptic treatment amisulpride primarely antidopaminergic drug . Thus , study antipsychotic efficacy cannabidiol , also compare effect treatment strategy side effect neuropsychological functioning .</brief_summary>
