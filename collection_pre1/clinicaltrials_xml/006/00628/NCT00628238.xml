	<brief_title>Multi-center Trial Revlimid® Rituximab , First-Line Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CLL Research Consortium ( CRC ) conduct two-arm , multi-center phase II trial Revlimid® rituximab first-line treatment patient CLL . Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) derivative thalidomide immune-modulating property . Revlimid® FDA approve treatment relapse multiple myeloma 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome . Revlimid® promise clinical activity relapse CLL two early clinical trial . However , mechanism ( ) whereby Revlimid® active CLL unknown . Rituximab ( Rituxan® ) protein bind CD20 express normal leukemia B cell . Rituximab FDA approve treatment lymphoma use commonly treatment CLL . The purpose study evaluate safety activity combination Revlimid® rituximab CLL , elucidate mechanism Revlimid® CLL , ass whether prognostic factor might predict patient likely benefit therapy future . As old patient commonly under-represented CLL clinical trial less tolerable frontline therapy utilizes combination fludarabine cyclophosphamide trial two arm ; one specifically assess tolerability regimen old subject . The primary objective study determine response rate combination Revlimid® Rituximab previously untreated CLL patient two arms- age 65 year younger 65 . Secondary objective evaluate safety combination Revlimid® Rituximab , response duration , improvement hematologic parameter , activity combination high-risk CLL subset , significance tumor flare reaction . All patient baseline assessment know CLL prognostic factor include : immunoglobulin variable heavy chain ( IgVH ) gene mutational status , interphase cytogenetics , intracellular ZAP-70 expression , CD38 expression CRC tissue core . These know prognostic feature CLL together novel prognostic factor evaluate ability predict response treatment Revlimid® combination Revlimid® Rituximab . Extensive biologic corollary study design evaluate mechanism Revlimid® CLL , impact Revlimid® CLL microenvironment , Revlimid® 's impact rituximab mediate cytotoxicity . All patient receive treatment . Revlimid® start low dose slowly escalate base patient tolerability . Rituximab administer follow 21 day Revlimid® monotherapy . Patients continue treatment 7 cycle unless toxicity progressive disease . There three plan response assessment subject : single agent Revlimid® response assessment prior addition rituximab , 3 cycle treatment , follow therapy .</detailed_description>
