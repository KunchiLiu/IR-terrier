	<brief_summary>Twenty per cent intensive care patient mechanically ventilate suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . These patient stay longer Intensive Care costly prone nosocomial infection.In addition , long bedridden develop muscular weakness.Prolonged inactivity result respiratory skeletal muscle weakness curtails simple daily activity.The principal purpose study compare two type muscular rehabilitation ( electrical stimulation thigh and/or cycloergometer training ) classic passive mobilization leg.The second purpose analyse effect type rehabilitation muscular fiber ( structural functional analysis ) muscular biopsies.Two hundred forty COPD patient admit intensive care unit acute respiratory failure randomize 4 : 1 fashion receive passive mobilization leg ( group 1 , n=60 ) , electrical stimulation thigh ( group 2 , n=60 ) , cycloergometer training ( group 3 , n=60 ) electrical stimulation thigh cycloergometer training ( group 4 , n=60 ) .The rehabilitation program last 4 week 5 session per week.In group patient , muscular biopsy do local anaesthesia begin end rehabilitation programme discharge service .</brief_summary>
