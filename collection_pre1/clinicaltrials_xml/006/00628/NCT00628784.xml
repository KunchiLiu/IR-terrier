	<brief_summary>In prospective single center study , 25 patient Barrett 's esophagus LGD dysplasia ( Group 1 ) , 25 patient HGD/IMCA ( Group 2 ) , 25 patient esophageal carcinoma confine esophageal wall ( Group 3 ) 25 patient severe esophageal squamous dysplasia ( Group 4 ) treat endoscopic cryotherapy . This study single arm blinding utilized . Interim analysis data review DCI statistician 14 patient group treat cryotherapy safety efficacy document point time , request ability extend enrollment maximum allowable amount 25 patient per group . The propose study duration seven year , allow two year patient enrollment 5 year post treatment follow-up . Study duration per patient total approximately six year . Patients Barrett 's esophagus dysplasia low grade dysplasia ( group 1 ) treat cryotherapy six week interval Barrett 's mucosa ablate six treatment administer . Patients Barrett 's HGD IMCA severe esophageal squamous dysplasia ( group 2 4 ) treat cryotherapy six-week interval Barrett 's mucosa ablate six treatment administer . More advanced mass lesion typically difficult eradicate ablative therapy may progress fast patient IMCA , therefore , patient advance cancer ( group 3 ) treat every 2 week lesion eradicate eight treatment . After cryotherapy treatment complete ( i.e . esophagus re-epithelialized normal squamous epithelium Groups 1 , 2 , 4 tumor locally controlled/absent Group 3 ) , patient assess endoscopy biopsy every three month one year , every six month two year , annually two year ( flow sheet - appendix 1 ; study schedule - appendix 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline evaluation include follow ( consider standard care except # 8 ) : 1 . Informed consent . 2 . Evaluation inclusion/exclusion criterion 3 . Demographics- date birth , age , gender , ethnicity 4 . Medical history physical exam 5 . Imaging ( group 2 , 3 4 ) i. CT scan chest abdomen oral intravenous contrast ( allergic ) ii . Endoscopic Ultrasound , evaluation esophageal wall mediastinum upper abdomen evidence abnormal lymph node . Suspicious lymph node ( round , hypoechoic , homogeneous , &gt; 5mm ) undergo EUS-guided fine needle aspiration appropriate , deem principal investigator . 6 . Pathology review ( group 2 4 ) - two independent reviewer , include least one WRAMC Pathology Department , review pathology slide esophageal biopsy . This review serve confirm diagnosis Barrett 's esophagus high grade dysplasia and/or IMCA agreement diagnosis adenocarcinoma degree dysplasia . 7 . Presentation Tumor Board prior enter protocol ( group 2 , 3 4 ) . 8 . Dysphagia score ( see Appendix 4 ) research purpose . Prior cryotherapy : As part research protocol , patient treat high dose proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) ( lansoprazole 30mg , esomeprazole 40mg , pantoprazole 40mg , omeprazole 40mg rabeprazole 40mg ) BID maximal acid suppression complete ablation achieve patient exit study . All agent consider equally effective dos list one agent consider superior . Treatment research dose begin least one week prior first cryotherapy session . Pre-enrollment standard dose PPI restart patient enters surveillance phase exit study . Care take avoid , possible , potentially toxic medication esophageal mucosa ( i.e . non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , bisphosphonates , potassium supplement ) . EGD/Cryotherapy Patients schedule EGD cryotherapy designate day support cryotherapy device available accord study timeline ( Appendix 2 ) . A commitment CSA Medical Inc. ( Baltimore , MD ) provide technical support session allow patient timely treatment . Patients prepare EGD standard fashion use overnight fast sip clear liquid require medication allow 2 hour procedure . Patients interview prior procedure use standardized questionnaire ( Appendix 3 ) . This questionnaire ass overall sense well-being , general state health , ability perform activity daily live , ability eat . It specifically solicit symptom chest pain , irregular heart rate , shortness breath , dysphagia odynophagia . A dysphagia score also measure ( appendix 4 ) . Moderate sedation intravenous meperidine fentanyl midazolam administer staff investigator perform EGD use therapeutic upper endoscope adherence standard protocol . A 14 18 French nasogastric tube modify decompression port span distal 12 inch tube ( allow decompression stomach esophagus ) place stomach direct visualization . This connect continuous suction allow decompression cryotherapy procedure . During procedure assistant monitor record heart rate , blood pressure oxygen saturation per WRAMC moderate sedation guideline . All subject treat narcotic analgesic anti-emetics needed procedure . Groups 1 , 2 4 At first procedure , proximal edge squamocolumnar junction ( SCJ ) tip gastric fold ( gastroesophageal junction GEJ ) mark submucosal tattoo India ink ( SPOT , GI Supply , Camp Hill , PA ) use standard sclerotherapy needle ( already perform ) . The ink tattoo guide measurement response ablation sample neo-squamous segment residual Barrett 's follow exam . For severe esophageal squamous dysplasia , tattoo apply proximal distal margin dysplastic area . If allergic iodine , Lugol 's solution use stain squamous mucosa exam outline area severe squamous dysplasia guide tattoo placement . Lugol 's chosen since normal squamous , dysplasia carcinoma stain vital stain . These mark place research purpose help ensure accurate measurement assess change Barrett 's segment therapy record . ( 30 ) The location squamocolumnar junction ( SCJ ) , esophagogastric junction ( EGJ ) diaphragmatic hiatus ( DH ) document term centimeter incisor . Any island squamous tissue within Barrett 's segment photograph , measure , record . If SCJ well visualized , chromoendoscopy Lugol 's solution , highlight squamous epithelium , perform . The cryocatheter pass therapeutic channel endoscope extend one cm beyond distal tip scope . Liquid nitrogen spray cryocatheter , cause white frost ( cryoburn ) adjacent mucosa . The distal aspect Barrett 's esophagus segment treat first endoscope slowly withdraw proximally , maneuver tip cryocatheter cryoburn extend `` paint '' white frost cryoburn circumferentially . The spray apply duration 10 second measure integrated device timer . During cryotherapy session , process repeat four time piecemeal fashion give area treat maintain frozen state total 40 second . A frozen state define mucosa appear white . At completion endoscopic procedure , patient monitor recovery area completely awake , alert able discharge accord standard conscious sedation policy . Following discharge endoscopy suite , patient contact one week telephone ass immediate complication . A questionnaire complete study physician nurse ( appendix 3 ) . Patients see day clinic endoscopy center serious concern ( patient study personnel ) . Patients return 6 week ( group 1 , 2 4 ) reassessment repeat EGD cryotherapy residual Barrett 's mucosa . The interview questionnaire dysphagia score repeat EGD . The location SCJ , EGJ DH dysplastic region record photograph characterize precise size location islands squamous tissue within Barrett 's segment . If gross evidence mucosal injury due previous cryotherapy ( mucosal break include erosion , tear , ulcer ) procedure terminate ablation hold additional 2 week . If gross evidence esophageal mucosal injury , cryotherapy repeat . The process continue complete ablation Barrett 's mucosa achieve maximum number treatment session perform ( 8 treatment total ) . When appear endoscopically nearly mucosa replace normal appear squamous mucosa , biopsy several biopsy may take discretion endoscopist suspicious area confirm cryotherapy complete . When `` quick look '' biopsy take , cryotherapy perform day . If pathology result return reveal sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia dysplasia , cryotherapy may resume two week biopsy take ( allow adequate time mucosa heal ) . If biopsy confirm resolution , patient schedule post-cryotherapy surveillance . Biopsies take endoscopy use clinical purpose assess patient 's histologic response cryotherapy . As , excess tissue collect stored purpose . Group 3 : Group 3 patient undergo cryotherapy intent ablate neoplasia . Group 3 patient long segment Barrett 's esophagus undergo ablation nodular area and/or mass lesion . Flat Barrett 's treat . The mass lesion treat entirety frozen 20 second . This repeated total treatment time 60 second . Follow endoscopy allow repeat treatment cryotherapy every two week lesion eradicate treat 8 time , whichever come first . These patient offer aggressive therapy ( every 2 week rather every 6 week ) , due presence advance disease . Treatment withhold evidence active ulceration resume heal . When appear endoscopically cancer eradicate nearly mucosa replace normal appear squamous mucosa , biopsy several biopsy may take discretion endoscopist suspicious area confirm cryotherapy complete . When `` quick look '' biopsy take , cryotherapy perform day . If pathology result return reveal sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia cancer , cryotherapy may resume . If biopsy confirm resolution , patient schedule post-cryotherapy surveillance . Biopsies take endoscopy use clinical purpose assess patient 's histologic response cryotherapy . As , excess tissue collect stored purpose . No blood drawn study . The initial EGD procedure estimate require 45 minute perform due possible need perform Lugol 's stain and/or India ink mark esophagus . Subsequent re-treatment EGD 's estimate require 30 minute perform . An EGD reveals heal `` quick look '' biopsy take take 10 minute perform .</detailed_description>
