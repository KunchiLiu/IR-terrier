	<brief_title>BION Treatment Dysphagia After Radical Head-Neck Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disseminated head neck cancer serious , often life-threatening medical problem require immediate heroic therapeutic intervention . Treatment typically begin extensive surgery follow soon possible intense series radiation chemotherapy treatment . Typically patient recover sufficiently surgery 2-4 week withstand new assault result chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) , kill cancer cell , also cause muscle atrophy scar permanently ruin swallow apparatus . Thus , majority patient undergo CRT develop severe swallow problem , call dysphagia , typically become bad 3-4 week follow begin CRT . In anticipation problem , subject tube place stomach ( gastrostomy tube ) feed tube immediate postoperative period incision fragile dysphagia develop CRT . Clearly management dysphagia CRT primary importance prognosis patient . Recent study show electrical activation swallow muscle CRT improve prognosis reduce dysphagia , currently available technology require current apply transcutaneously . Thus , large electrical current must apply damaged skin , electrical stimulation result uncomfortable , diffuse uncontrolled . It difficult approach stimulate deepest muscle prefer target stimulation . The primary goal propose study improve long-term swallow capability subject undergoing radical modify radical neck surgery follow CRT , selective stimulation swallow muscle use implanted microstimulators call BIONs . The mechanism electrical stimulation think rehabilitative approach muscle , i.e. , help maintain strength mobility muscle post-operative treatment period muscle use particularly vulnerable scar atrophy . Two different paradigm stimulation employ order compare gain insight mechanism involve remediation . This study also present opportunity examine directly change muscle produce stimulation . Thus , secondary research goal study take advantage opportunity present intervention gain insight cellular change think underlie effect radiation subsequent electrical stimulation . By implant device time neck surgery , possible target nerve supply specific muscle thus ensure excitation specific muscle use current strength much low require transcutaneous stimulation .</detailed_description>

Subject previous surgery disease upper esophageal tract vocal structure change normal anatomical relationship epiglottal region , make swallow abnormal , damaged nerve target muscle control swallowing , make difficult stimulate swallowing muscle effectively . 5 . Subject active immunosuppressive disorder AIDS may result muscle wasting , neurological injury disease affect function nerve neuromuscular endplate throat , myasthenia gravis multiple sclerosis . The subject significant concurrent recently diagnose ( less 3 month ) medical condition , opinion medical investigator , could affect ability patient tolerate complete study . Such condition might include second malignancy , heart disease stroke . 6 . Subject major psychological disorder , poorly control schizophrenia paranoia , may affect clinical interaction subject result poor compliance therapy . 7 . Subject significant respiratory problem asthma chronic obstructive lung disease require regular use inhale systemic corticosteroid . Subject tracheostomy previous surgery trachea damage swallow muscle make inhalation swallow food likely . 8 . Subject currently enrol another investigational study .</criteria>
