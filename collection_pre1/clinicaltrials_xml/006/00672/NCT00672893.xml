	<brief_summary>Vibration response imaging ( VRI ) technology , provide radiation-free dynamic image lung , visualize vibration energy emit respiration cycle ( lung sound ) . Airflow lung respiration cycle create vibration propagate lung tissue ; vibration affect structural property lung may vary space , time frequency . Moreover , structural alteration , bronchial obstruction space occupy infiltration , reflect corresponding modification vibration response . As obstruction occur airway alter airflow , VRI may provide additional lung function information prior treatment airway obstruction follow-up . Moreover , VRI may provide physician immediate evaluation improvement air flow distribution , quantitative qualitative measurement . Furthermore , VRI non-invasive , radiation free procedure simple n't require level patient effort require lung function test evaluation .</brief_summary>
