	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) major public health problem country . It estimate least one every seven woman society victim childhood sexual abuse least 18th birthday . Previous study show stress associate damage neuron hippocampus , brain area involve learning memory . Also , image study brain function consistent dysfunction medial prefrontal cortex presentation traumatic cue . We previously show serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication ( paroxetine ; Paxil ) change memory function hippocampal structure PTSD . We propose perform placebo control study Paxil CR ( paroxetine hydrochloride controlled-release tablet ) , think paroxetine less side-effects . The main purpose study determine effect Paxil CR memory deficit measure neuropsychological testing , hippocampal volume measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , medial prefrontal lobe cortical function estimate PET , cortisol response ( reflect intensity stress ) men woman PTSD . We plan recruit 40 subject . After complete physical examination evaluate neuropsychiatric history , patient undergo initial group test include memory testing , MRI PET brain scan , measurement cortisol saliva . Afterwards , half receive Paxil CR 12.5 62.5 mg half receive placebo ( sugar pill ) begin first 12 week `` Double Blind Phase '' . After 12 week , administered memory test , PET MRI scan post-treatment phase . After period , Paxil CR offer placebo group follow additional 12 week . They final memory test , MRI scan . We hypothesize Paxil CR exert efficacy act abnormal neural circuit , include hippocampus prefrontal cortex , PTSD .</brief_summary>
