	<brief_title>Susceptibility Chronic Post-Traumatic Extremity Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective association study recruit patient experience single extremity trauma , schedule elective surgery single extremity . HRQoL determine recruitment . We identify haplotype genotype 4 link SNPs cod region COMT describe Diatchenko [ 2 ] . Patients receive follow-up 3 6 month follow trauma surgery . Individuals report either neuropathic pain reduce HRQoL score closely examine , order identify CPSP CRPS . Statistical analysis perform determine whether haplotype associate development either condition , determine strength association .</detailed_description>
