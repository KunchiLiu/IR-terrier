	<brief_summary>New evidence suggest autistic disorder ( AD ) may associate abnormality folate metabolism , process affect genetic expression facilitate formation methyl donor DNA methylation . Limited data show child AD show behavioral improvement folic acid ( FA ) therapy , others show worsen effect . If behavioral worsening link abnormality folate metabolism , nutritional modification could normalize process result clinical improvement . To address premise , propose randomize , placebo-controlled crossover pilot study two phase . The first phase focus behavioral biochemical response child AD high-dose folic acid supplementation . Because FA inactive folate require biochemical conversion become active , select genotype impede conversion , general hypothesis FA yield behavioral improvement child exacerbate problem behavior others . During second phase , child worsen behavioral response FA phase 1 participate open-label trial high-dose Metafolin® supplementation . The focus would similarly behavioral biochemical outcome participate child follow treatment study supplement . Because Metafolin® active folate metabolite affect genotype folate pathway , general hypothesis phase 2 Metafolin® would yield behavioral improvement without risk behavioral worsening . Results project may provide support continue study potential relationship folate metabolism problem behavior among child AD , potentially justify need examine effect folate supplementation among large sample affect child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There limit data use folic acid treatment child autistic disorder ( AD ) . Most experimentation thus far focused effect folic acid supplementation small sample male fragile X syndrome ( FRAX ) , many participant meet criterion AD say exhibit autistic-like feature . Initial case report suggest folic acid might effective treatment FRAX , note reduced expression fragile site Xq27 blood culture . Subsequent work find high dos folic acid supplementation reduce percentage FRAX positive cell increase plasma-folate concentration among 9 male FRAX . Autistic-like behavior say improve 5 young participant ( age range 3 year , 5 month 9 year , 10 month ) ; however , one adult , age 49 , develop increase motor activity aggressiveness treatment . His behavior return pretreatment level follow discontinuation folic acid . In similar work , researcher employ crossover design use 4 boy ( age 6 14 ) comorbid autism FRAX ass efficacy folic acid supplementation . Favorable behavioral change note 3 boy ; however , 2 , carryover effect folic acid placebo period may cloud magnitude potential difference folic acid versus placebo effect . No change throughout trial evidence fourth child , also old one commence puberty . Overall , investigation folic acid supplementation small group FRAX participant yield inconsistent finding , favorable behavioral and/or biochemical effect others . Moreover , finding generalize broad population child AD FRAX . Our search literature uncover one report folic acid treatment prescribe 2 child without FRAX , one describe psychotic mental retardation , diagnosis autism . For child , behavior notably improve treatment return problematic level folic acid therapy stop . In addition empirical study , numerous anecdotal report family use folate treatment child , promulgate Internet websites Autism Research Institute 's ( ARI ) publication , Autism Research Review International . For part , report favorable . Additionally , ARI recently publish finding web-based investigation parent-reported use efficacy wide range treatment child AD . Of 1437 family indicate use folic acid therapeutic supplement , 42 % say child get well , 54 % say child exhibit noticeable change , 3 % say child get bad . Taken together , limit data support possibility folic acid folate generate favorable outcome among child AD ; may hold true particularly pre-adolescent child . The lack empirically sound information folic-acid efficacy among child AD , however , also leave open possibility increase supplementation may helpful could , fact , harmful . There evidence suggest high dos folic acid supplementation produce negative physiological and/or behavioral response , gastrointestinal disturbance , sleep difficulty , malaise/irritability , excitability/overactivity sample typical adult . Many symptom similar identical described generally child AD . Additionally , favorable anecdotal report folic acid treatment , negative one , well . For example , parent one teenager AD tell u , son participate stepwise-administered supplement program folic acid administer final supplement , become extremely agitate , self-injurious , aggressive toward parent , prone frantic gesturing , develop sleep difficulty . When folic acid withdrawn , behavior gradually subside pre-supplementation level ( personal communication , September 27 , 2003 ) . As whether folic acid supplementation might `` good '' `` bad , '' alternative explanation folic acid may beneficial circumstance harmful others . This explanation potentially attractive one hypothesize conversion homocysteine methionine ( folate necessary ) beneficial , high dos folic acid lead anti-folate effect accumulation `` free folic acid . '' For individual imbalanced metabolic profile adequate level B12 , seem folic acid supplementation would yield favorable effect normalize profile . However , folic acid supplementation could lead problematic behavior one combination biological scenario , include accumulation unmetabolized pteroylglutamic acid ( PGA ) serum , B12 deficiency , and/or genotype know impede biochemical conversion folic acid . Given negative response folic acid supplementation typically report among adolescent adult , possible phenomenon regulate maturational process . One possibility achieve maximum folate benefit without risk anti-folate effect supplementation form folate , Metafolin , serve directly methyl donor . Metafolin L-form isomer 5- methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5-MTHF ) , presumably , active compound folic acid folinic acid ( leucovorin ) . Metafolin approve use U.S. dietary supplement since 2001 . While study around globe test safety 5-MTHF dos 17mg , yet study examine efficacy therapeutic agent specific neurodevelopmental disorder . However , folinic acid ( 5,10- MTHF ) , immediately precede 5-MTHF folate-metabolism cycle , investigate repeatedly potential therapeutic agent population . In one study , James et al . examined biochemical effect folinic acid supplementation conjunction betaine vitamin B12 biochemical outcome child imbalanced metabolic profile . This team initially discover , compare control group , child AD significantly low baseline concentration methionine , S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) , homocysteine significantly high concentration S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) adenosine -- metabolic profile consistent impaired capacity methylation . Following supplementation study treatment , metabolic imbalance within AD group normalize . This research team recently publish result extension work assessed level folate-related metabolite genotype select enzyme . Approximately 50 % child AD severely abnormal metabolic profile ; additionally , `` ... several susceptibility allele perturb common metabolic pathway increase among autistic child . The hypothesis genetic component autism could involve multiple susceptibility allele interact create fragile , environmentally sensitive metabolic imbalance worthy pursuit , '' ( electronic copy ; page number available ) .</detailed_description>
