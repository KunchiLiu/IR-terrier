	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy Lovaza ( formerly know Omacor ) reduce triglyceride level youth age 10-19 year old whose baseline triglycerides range 150 mg/dl 1000 mg/dl . Seventy subject recruit baseline randomize treatment condition , Lovaza 4 grams/day 6 month control condition , corn oil placebo , 4 tablet day 6 month . Participants treatment control group receive standard care , dietary advice follow low , refined carbohydrate low saturate fat diet emphasize increase intake fruit vegetable eat 2 serving per week fish rich omega-3 fatty acid , consistent American Heart Association recommendation . The primary outcome change fast triglyceride baseline 3 month . The investigator hypothesize patient receive LOVAZA significantly great reduction plasma triglyceride level compare patient placebo 3 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose conduct placebo control , double blind , parallel group randomize trial evaluate efficacy Lovaza ( formerly know Omacor ) reduce triglyceride level youth age 10-19 year old whose baseline triglycerides range from150 mg/dl 1000 mg/dl . Seventy subject recruit baseline randomize treatment condition , Lovaza 4 grams/day 6 month control condition , corn oil placebo , 4 tablet day 6 month . Participants treatment control group receive standard care , dietary advice follow low , refined carbohydrate low saturate fat diet emphasize increase intake fruit vegetable eat 2 serving per week fish rich omega-3 fatty acid , consistent American Heart Association recommendation ( Kris-Etherton , 2003 ) . Subjects randomized treatment control condition 4 week run-in period dietary education advice . The primary outcome change fast triglyceride baseline 3 month . 2.0 SPECIFIC AIMS 2.1 Primary Aim/Outcome - To determine efficacy LOVAZA reduce plasma triglyceride level among adolescent , age 12-19 year mild moderate hypertriglyceridemia . We hypothesize patient receive LOVAZA significantly great reduction plasma triglyceride level compare patient placebo 3 month . 2.2 Secondary Aims/Outcome - To determine whether efficacy LOVAZA vary duration treatment , 3 month versus 6 month . - To determine effect LOVAZA plasma HDL LDL cholesterol 3 month 6 month . - To determine effect LOVAZA systolic diastolic blood pressure 3 month 6 month . 2.3 Exploratory Aims - To describe effect LOVAZA vascular reactivity/endothelial function measure pulse amplitude 3 month 6 month . - To describe effect LOVAZA level biomarkers inflammation measure C-Reactive Protein 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
