	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety effectiveness investigational drug , Ixabepilone , men high risk prostate cancer plan receive surgery . Prostate cancer common important health issue face men United States . Most patient prostate cancer identify disease limited prostate gland ( localized prostate cancer ) . A standard treatment patient localized prostate cancer removal prostate gland operation know `` radical prostatectomy . '' A sub-set patient localized prostate cancer identify high-risk suffering recurrence prostate cancer radical prostatectomy . For patient , additional treatment investigate combine surgery hop increase chance cure . Several kind chemotherapy medicine use advanced prostate cancer return initial therapy . Epothilones newly develop class chemotherapy drug appear promise treatment many form cancer . Ixabepilone drug epothilone class chemotherapy medicine show encouraging result treatment advanced prostate cancer cancer clinical trial . This trial include men high-risk localized prostate cancer receive treatment ixabepilone ( 4 cycle 12 week ) prior radical prostatectomy . The goal trial determine analysis gene protein prostate cancer tissue take treatment use predict ixabepilone response . In addition , trial evaluate safety feasibility administer ixabepilone prior radical prostatectomy patient high-risk develop recurrent prostate cancer . The study three phase : Screening , Treatment Follow-up - Screening : Eligibility verify - Treatment : Subjects receive Ixabepilone , administer every 21 day 4 cycle prior surgery - Follow : Subjects follow every 6 month 5 year . In addition , tissue collect time surgery genetic protein study . Blood also collect pre post therapy proteomic and/or genetic study .</brief_summary>
