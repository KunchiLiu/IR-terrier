	<detailed_description>Considerable interest recently generate dietary fiber ( DF ) , soluble fiber emerge subject research therapeutic application . The 'fiber hypothesis ' , put forward Denis Bukitt Hugh Trowel ( 1-4 ) , suggest consumption unrefined carbohydrate food protect many western ailment include colon cancer , diverticular disease , appendicitis , constipation , haemorrhoid , diabetes , heart disease , gall stone , obesity among others . In line hypothesis , many basic laboratory clinical work do . The term 'dietary fiber ' used denote plant polysaccharide lignin resistant hydrolysis human digestive enzyme ( 5,6 ) . The detailed chemistry metabolism DF also study ( 7-10 ) . The classification fiber base chemical structure ( 11 ) , divide non-polysaccharides non-starch polysaccharide . Lignin non-polysaccharide fiber , polymer phenolic alcohol water insoluble . The non-starch polysaccharide divide cellulose non-cellulose fiber . Cellulose consist un-branched D-glucose chain 1,4-ß linkage water insoluble . Non-cellulose polysaccharide include hemicelluloses , mucillages , gum pectin , consist various ß linkage wide variety hexose pentose sugar . The polysaccharide chain heteroglycans ( chain one type monosaccharide ) . The hemicellulosic material polymer xylose , mannose glucose side chain galactose arabinose . The pectic substance polymer galacturonic acid . Likewise , gum mucillages branch carbohydrate polymer ( e.g . gum , linear mannan galactose side chain ) . Non-cellulose polysaccharide vary degree water solubility ( 7,9,10 ) . In man , fiber mainly degrade large intestine bacterial flora . Many effect fiber stool output arise degradation . The main product fiber fermentation short chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) include acetate , propionate butyrate , major anion colon . Bacteria utilize SCFAs proliferate , absorb water colonic epithelium course metabolism , thus decrease free water content lumen ( 11 ) . The SCFAs utilized bacteria largely absorbed colon ( 12 ) . Their transepithelial transport associate stimulation sodium transport colon several specie include human ( 13-15 ) . This effect may particularly important acute diarrhoeal diseases purge , associate reduce food intake might deplete colon SCFAs lead colonic dysfunction ( 16 , 17 ) . Thus , luminal SCFAs level colon might influence clinical course acute diarrhoeal disease . SCFAs also show clinically important one diarrhoeal disease animal -transmissible gastroenteritis swine ( 18 ) . Animals infect virus develop acute enteritis mark fluid loss small intestine . Young animal develop severe diarrhoea colonic mucosa incapable absorb fluid , whereas old infect animal show increased colonic absorption six-folds control . This compensatory response prevents severe diarrhoea related development colonic fermentation production SCFAs . Cholera disease human affect small intestine fluid electrolyte secretion increase absorption decrease lead profuse watery diarrhoea . As human colon capacity absorb water electrolyte ( 19 ) , compensation expect reduce diarrhoeal loss . In recent study ( 20 , 21 ) SCFAs show stimulate sodium absorption colon , effect influence c-AMP , additionally find inhibit cyclic AMP-mediated chloride secretion colon . The SCFA-enhanced colonic absorption water electrolyte might exploit treatment acute diarrhoeal disease . Oral rehydration therapy dramatically change management acute diarrhoeal disease . Yet , oral rehydration therapy process improve . Cereal-based oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) show reduce stool volume 30 % 40 % compare WHO-ORS ( 22 , 23 ) . It possible , least part effect stool volume reduction might attribute SCFAs produce unabsorbed carbohydrate include dietary fiber colon . Diversion colitis inflammatory process affect bypass colon rectum follow surgical diversion faecal stream ( 24 ) . The inflammation disappear surgical re-anastomosis , topical steroid usually ineffective ( 25 ) . Rectal instillation SCFAs result disappearance symptom endoscopic change period 4-6 week ; remission maintain year regular rectal SCFAs treatment ( 26 ) . These finding suggest SCFAs also play role mucosal heal colitis The colonic epithelial cell utilize SCFAs source energy various metabolic activity ( 27 , 28 ) . Human colonocytes use butyrate preference glucose , glutamine ketone body fuel source ( 27 ) . Thus , contrast small intestinal cell , colonic epithelial cell derive major part energy supply lumen rather blood . Depriving luminal nutrition mucosa find induce fluid secretion ( 29 ) . The lack luminal SCFAs colon may involve special diarrhoeal state diversion colitis antibiotic associate diarrhoea . Diarrhoea uncommon abdominal operation , particularly closure temporary colostomy ( 30 ) . Although proof , postoperative diarrhoea might attribute lack SCFAs colon , might perhaps reverse intake fermentable fiber ( 31 ) . Lengthy preoperative bowel preparation antibiotic lavage , diminish oral nutrition probably contribute postoperative diarrhoea . Lack luminal SCFAs similarly explain diarrhoea often see terminal stage malnutrition starvation . In condition , intestinal infection might always implicate seem likely diarrhoea manifestation organ-specific malnutrition colon ( 32 ) . Diarrhoea often associate use broad-spectrum antibiotic , colonization toxin produce clostridium difficile account third case ( 33 ) . The use antibiotic suppress formation SCFAs fermentable carbohydrate ( 34 ) , feature might also responsible diarrhoea . Although lots data suggest antidiarrhoeal effect fermentable fiber , therapeutic application diarrhoeal disease yet examine . Some recent clinical study demonstrate beneficial effect dietary fiber treatment adult cholera ( 35 ) treatment child acute diarrhoea ( 36 ) . In child acute diarrhoea , Benefiber-added ORS observe reduce mean duration diarrhoea 16 hour , ( 74 vs. 90 h ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . Further study require evaluate effect Benefiber reduce severity duration cholera , form severe dehydrate diarrhoea . Guar gum : soluble fiber Guar gum dietary fiber obtain endosperm seeds Indian cluster bean ( Cyanopsis tetragonolobus ) family Leguminosae . The guar plant pod bearing , nitrogen-fixing legume , grown century India Pakistan , one principal crop use food human animal . It grown America use various industry ( food , cosmetic paper industry ) ( 37 ) . Chemically , guar gum non-starch polysaccharide , galactomannan , contact water form highly viscous gel . In colon , guar gum ferment form SCFAs . Initially , guar gum use thickener emulsion stabilizer food process basis gel property ( 37 ) . Our present interest guar gum therapeutic use dietary fiber . `` Benefiber '' ( partially hydrolyze guar gum ) Guar gum form gel water , rather viscous , thus unsuitable therapeutic us ( e.g . liquid enteral nutrition ) . Benefiber partially-hydrolized ( vitro enzyme endo-B-mannase ) guar gum , soluble fiber . It expect Benefiber readily utilize colonic microflora production product fermentation guar gum . The partial hydrolysis guar gum ( e.g . Benefiber ) result significant reduction viscosity solution . It also expect cause delay gastric empty also interfere normal absorption macronutrients ( carbohydrate , protein fat ) . In one study ( 38 ) , addition Benefiber liquid formulation diet significantly delay colonic transit time without affect oro-caecal transit time . The result another recent study ( 39 ) Liestal , Switzerland observe Benefiber affect absorption glucose , amino acid fat . Benefiber chosen study several reason . First , partially-hydrolyzed guar gum ( PHGG ) , completely dissolve water make clear solution . Second , fiber usually viscous , thus suitable use ORS ; amylase-resistant starch soluble make suspension . Third , vitro study fermentation , use fresh faecal inoculate , SCFAs production observe high PHGG comparison commercial fiber substitute ( 40 ) . Fourth , study non-cholera diarrhoea child , observe PHGG clinically useful ( 36 ) . In study ( 36 ) , use PHGG dose 20g/L . This dose select arbitrarily basis standard dose use preparation liquid formulation diet . In proposed study , would like test two different dos ( 25 g/L 50 g/L ) determine additional benefit increase dose . Based finding previous study well study do elsewhere , hopeful addition Benefiber WHO-ORS would lead fermentation colon result production SCFAs , would improve colonic function include colonic absorption salt water thus reduce stool output well shorten duration diarrhoea adult cholera . Safety issue Benefiber Benefiber food material obtain vegetable source use cereal , juice , shake , yogurt , soup , back good , fiber source enteral nutrition product . It undergone extensive toxicity test find safe ( 41 ) . In human volunteer study ( 38 , 39 ) , enteral nutrition product supplement Benefiber 20 g/L find safe . Two clinical trial ( 36 , Alam et al. , unpublished data ) child perform ICDDR , B recently - one study ORS supplement Brenefiber 20 g/L study comminute chicken-based diet supplement Benefiber 20 g/L . No adverse effect note study . In proposed study , Benefiber supplement ORS either 25 g/L 50 g/L treatment adult cholera . As cholera patient profuse watery stool short transit time , 50 % fiber expect excrete stool unchanged . As treatment cholera short duration ( 2-3 day ) , anticipate adverse effect .</detailed_description>
