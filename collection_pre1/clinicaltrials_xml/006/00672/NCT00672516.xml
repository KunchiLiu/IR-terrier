	<brief_summary>We believe ongoing bleeding complex cardiac surgery accurately measure administration specific blood product replacement strategy design optimally slow stop bleeding follow operation . Patients risk significant bleeding complex cardiac surgery approach allow operation watch study personnel see ongoing blood loss accurately measure see quickly prescribe , standardize blood product replacement protocol control bleed slow stop bleeding . Permission review medical record see bleed risk feature identify permission follow patient surgery see recover also request .</brief_summary>
