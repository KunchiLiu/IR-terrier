	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine ability AGS-004 control HIV-1 replication determine HIV-1 immunotherapy make dendritic cell safe well tolerate , determine immunotherapy increase body 's immune response HIV-1 ; , determine stop anti-HIV drug , immunotherapy control HIV-1 virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study AGS‑004 Immunotherapeutic Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) -Treated Subjects Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although chronic ART raise cluster differentiation CD 4+ T cell count improve immune function , immune system ' ability control HIV-1 replication improve . AGS-004 immunotherapeutic agent make autologous DCs co electroporated amplified vitro transcribed ( IVT ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) encode CD40L IVT RNA encode three four autologous HIV-1 antigen . The HIV-1 RNA derive plasma sample take immediately prior initiation ART .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 60 year age HIV1 infection Subjects must first ART regimen least 3 month : 2 NRTIs together NNRTI and/or least 1 PI ( prior change ART regimen allow due tolerability , guideline change , simply dose viral control ) Durable viral suppression ( limit detection ) least 3 month prior ot Screening CD4+ T cell count ≥ 450 cells/mm3 least 90 day immediately prior Screening Availability ≥ 1.2 mL continually frozen plasma ( may thaw refrozen ) draw 90 day start ART preferably within 30 day . PreART plasma HIV1 RNA level ≥ 15,000 copies/mL time plasma archive commence ART PreART nadir CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 ( cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 one occasion allow subsequent preART CD4+ cell count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 least two time point . Laboratory value obtain Screening confirm prior Baseline Day 1 : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SG ` PT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x ULN ; ANC ≥ 750 cells/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL ; , Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 Female subject reproductive potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity 50 mIU/mL perform within 30 day prior Screening . All subject must agree participate conception process use contraception . Ability communicate effectively study personnel ; consider reliable , willing , cooperative term compliance Protocol requirement . Voluntary inform consent give participate study . Successful RNA amplification least 3 antigen ( must include Gag ) . HIV2 antibody positive . Positive test infectious disease include : clinically active , untreated syphilis ( positive rapid plasma regain test ( RPR ) clinically active hepatitis B infection ( positive Hep B surface antigen HBsAg ) active hepatitis C infection history hepatitis C infection positive test HTLV Type I Type II antibody Any acute infection serious medical illness within 14 day prior study entry History lymph node irradiation dissection Pregnancy breastfeed Previous use HIV1 immunotherapy , include IL2 Use hydroxyurea within 30 day prior Screening Immunodeficiency HIV1 requirement take immunomodulating concomitant medication Known allergy sensitivity investigational immunotherapy formulation Use systemic corticosteroid use topical steroid total area exceed 15 cm2 within 4 week Screening anticipated need periodic use corticosteroid study Receipt immune modulators suppressor within 30 day Screening Active autoimmune disease : Rheumatoid arthritis Inflammatory bowel disease Systemic lupus erythematosis Ankylosing spondylitis Hashimoto 's disease Scleroderma Multiple sclerosis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Type I diabetes mellitus ( insulin therapy Type II diabetes permit ) Participation another clinical trial within 30 day Screening use investigational agent ( previous use expand access ARTs permit ) Body weight less 30 kg . Changes ART regimen due virologic failure ( include toxicity ) Presence factor predict insufficient adherence protocol . Any condition assessment investigator would indicate best interest subject incompatible aspect study design , treatment plan , study objective subject participate . History evidence severe illness , malignancy , condition would make subject , opinion investigator , unsuitable study .</criteria>
