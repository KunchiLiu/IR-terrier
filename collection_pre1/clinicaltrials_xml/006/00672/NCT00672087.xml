	<brief_summary>The etiology pathogenesis interstitial cystitis ( IC ) relate condition men , chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) remain elusive . This hamper development mechanistic treatment strategy common , chronic distress medical condition . We believe IC perhaps CP/CPPS spectrum complex inter-related genetic acquire disease result interaction several gene regulate immune/inflammatory neurogenic parameter environmental factors/circumstances exposure , culminate combination pain , frequency , urgency sexual specific symptom . New research delineate dynamic powerful association immune neurogenic system pain activation . An immune-modulated neurogenic model IC illuminate action immune derive substance pain related substance might important discover determinant pain , void dysfunction gender specific sexual problem . This inter-related dynamic model IC disease pathogenesis could explore potential avenue lead novel diagnostic treatment strategy . We plan identify evaluate sensitivity specificity several novel nerve inflammation relate marker diagnosis follow IC ( CP/CPPS ) . By correlate level urine immune pain related substance disease mechanism , severity progression , may able create human disease specific model diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>
