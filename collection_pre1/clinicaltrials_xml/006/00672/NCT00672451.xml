	<brief_title>Rhubarb Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) diabetic nephropathy show beneficial slow progression disease . This would include use ACEI , aggressive blood pressure blood sugar control well possible intervention . Experimental study chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient China suggest rhubarb extract use alone equivalent protection afford ACEI . Furthermore use combination ACEI , renoprotective effect rhubarb appear additive . Rhubarb extract chinese herbal preparation use extensively china asian country treat constipation CKD . Its mechanism action prevent progression CKD uncertain perhaps related TGF beta TNF alpha inhibition . The specific aim determine combine effect rhubarb plus enalapril slow rate decline CKD ( use Iothalamate GFRs ) patient diabetes . A secondary aim would measure serum TGF beta concentration time see observed decrease rate decline CKD related change TGF beta level .</detailed_description>
