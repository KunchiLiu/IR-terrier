	<brief_summary>The broad objective proposal identify functional neuroanatomical correlate impairment response inhibition smoking abstinence . We measure change performance regional blood oxygenation level use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) smoker complete task design assess decision make response inhibition . Our primary hypothesis smoking abstinence result impaired response inhibition accompany decrease blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI signal brain region associate cognitive process include frontal cortex ventral striatum . Abstinence may also result performance-related increase activation brain region associate effortful processing include anterior cingulate cortex effort compensate deficit region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants learn practice Go/No-Go reaction time task ( Garavan , Hester , Murphy , Fassbender , &amp; Kelly , 2006 ) measure inhibitory excitatory aspect behavioral control . During task subject present alternate series Xs Ys center screen must press button every time see Go trial ( letter ' Y ' letter ' X ' ) inhibit response present No-Go trial ( interruption X Y alternate stream , e.g. , X Y Y ) .</detailed_description>
