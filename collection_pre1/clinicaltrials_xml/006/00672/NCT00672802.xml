	<brief_title>Safety Ramelteon Subjects With Mild Moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia characterize difficulty initiate maintain sleep , complaint non-restorative non-refreshing sleep . Transient insomnia affect approximately one-third one-half US population , base result 2 survey representative sample adult US population conduct Gallup Organization respondent ask `` ever difficulty sleep . '' Based report `` regular '' `` frequent '' sleep difficulty , result study suggest approximately one-tenth US population experience chronic insomnia . The ideal treatment insomnia would reduce latency onset sleep increase total sleep time , without negative impact sleep architecture without safety concern next-day effect . Ramelteon global development Takeda Chemical Industries , Ltd. , treatment transient chronic insomnia treatment Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders . This study conduct assess safety ramelteon subject chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Participation study anticipate 1.5 month .</detailed_description>
