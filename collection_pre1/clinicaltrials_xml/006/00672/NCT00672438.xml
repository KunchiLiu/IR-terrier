	<brief_summary>Proposed twin study test degree inter-individual difference pain sensitivity amount pain relief response opioid therapy inherit alternatively , due environmental factor . This knowledge important guide future study try explain inter-individual difference . For example , find difference largely due environmental factor would discourage genomic study emphasize epidemiological study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heritability Opioid Effects : A Twin Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal hypothesis evaluate degree analgesia provide opioids human display substantial familial aggregation , , fact , heritable . These study use classical twin paradigm determine role genetics environment influence analgesia range opioid effect . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) Determine degree opioid analgesic responses show familial aggregation make preliminary estimate heritability use heat cold pressor pain model , ( 2 ) determine degree non-analgesic opioid response show familial aggregation make preliminary estimate heritability . Side effect sedation , nausea , respiratory depression , pruritus , well positive affective response , measure abuse potential , monitor . Monozygotic ( MZ ) dizygotic ( DZ ) twin pair ( 125 total pair ) test control pain laboratory condition responses opioid infusion use complementary pain model monitor side effect additional psychometric index mood , sleep , abuse potential . The selected model provide unique mechanistic information involve different peripheral and/or central pain pathway . DNA sample collect zygosity test banked future study .</detailed_description>
