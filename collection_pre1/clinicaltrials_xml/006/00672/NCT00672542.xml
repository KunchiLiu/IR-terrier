	<brief_summary>Transfection siRNA target immunoproteasome alters proteasome-mediated antigen processing dendritic cell , generate TAA-derived peptide hypothesize , base preclinical result , induce enhance anti-melanoma immune response . This phase I study , open subject metastatic melanoma , assess safety vaccination melanoma tumor associate antigen-encoding RNA-transfected mature dendritic cell derive monocyte either untreated , transfected control siRNA , transfected siRNA target inducible immunoproteasome beta subunit LMP2 , LMP7 , MECL1 . A combination RNAs encode melanoma tumor associate antigens MART-1 , tyrosinase , gp100 , MAGE-3 utilized dendritic cell transfection . The vaccine administer intradermal injection extremity . Clinical laboratory toxicity characterize study arm . As secondary objective , phase I study also assess anti-melanoma immune response , well clinical response , induced vaccination dendritic cell-based product .</brief_summary>
