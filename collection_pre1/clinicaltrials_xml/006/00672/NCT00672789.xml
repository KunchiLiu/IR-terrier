	<brief_summary>Medication non-adherence true public health problem . Despite advancement molecular understanding disease improvement therapy , patient health outcome improve unless patient take prescribed medication regularly . Decreasing gap efficacious effective therapy patient SCD essential research agenda . Hydroxyurea show safe efficacious child infant . However , effectiveness prophylaxis depend adherence recommend regimen . Medication adherence SCD previously find sub-optimal patient take penicillin , desferoxamine , pain medication . Adherence HU study extent child SCD . Based estimate adherence chronic illness expect approximately 50 % patient &gt; 80 % adherent HU administration . There gold standard improve adherence treatment . There attempt SCD population improve adherence . These include day camp promote education desferoxamine peer support , combination slide-show SCD complication , weekly phone call clinic social worker calendar , seven-phase educational program . Given strike improvement peripheral blood smear finding patient SCD HU therapy , reduction number sickled cell , hypothesize view peripheral blood smear patient poor adherence HU compare blood smear someone HU use improve adherence non-adherent patient . We conduct randomize trial intervention regularly show child parent peripheral blood smear standard care , include reminder importance compliance review complete blood count parameter , include WBC , MCV , Hgb concentration . The outcome measure increase hemoglobin concentration % HbF increase perceive QOL . QOL measure age-appropriate parent/proxy PedsQLâ„¢ . Medication adherence also monitor throughout study pharmacy prescription refill , physician assessment , self-report via visual analogue scale . Adherence estimate , hemoglobin concentration , % HbF QOL measure baseline , 3 month 6 month .</brief_summary>
