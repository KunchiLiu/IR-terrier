	<brief_summary>Overweight obesity serious grow problem within United States . The usual approach weight loss-dieting , exercise , behavioral interventions-rarely result long-term weight loss . Therefore , evaluate safety efficacy glucomannan , fiber supplement promise weight loss effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Study Fiber Supplement Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective exploratory project evaluate safety efficacy highly viscous , water-soluble fiber supplement , glucomannan , achieve weight loss overweight moderately obese individual . Overweight obesity major public health problem U.S. account substantial morbidity , mortality , healthcare cost . Conventional approach weight loss largely ineffective , particularly long-term weight loss maintenance . Thus , critical need safe effective adjunctive treatment . A , limited study suggest glucomannan supplementation associate weight loss , well-tolerated , favorable safety profile . In preliminary study , target population overweight moderately obese individual , population account nearly 50 % U.S. adult . The specific aim project : 1 ) describe safety glucomannan achieve weight loss overweight moderately obese individual , 2 ) describe efficacy glucomannan achieve weight loss overweight moderately obese individual . Participants take glucomannan supplement daily eight week double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial . Safety efficacy outcome measure include : gastrointestinal symptoms/tolerance , hepatic panel , serum creatinine , weight , body composition , diet intake , hunger/fullness , lipid profile , blood glucose , C-reactive protein . Examination safety efficacy glucomannan achieve weight loss extend understand additional treatment may effective combat significant public health problem .</detailed_description>
