	<brief_summary>Introduction : Oral pain due mucosal lesion quite frequent oncology , geriatric well palliative care setting . The oncology patient mainly suffer radio- and/or chemotherapy induce oral mucositis . The incidence oral mucositis oncology patient range 15-40 % receive stomatotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy . The degree mucositis variable , associate pain frequent well document . Nowadays , basic oral care protocol mainstay prevent reduce mucositis pain . Pain mainly manage systemically administer analgesia . The pioneer work field radio-or chemotherapy induce mucositis treatment topical opioids do Cerchietti two pilot study : one compare `` magic '' mouthwash ( lidocaine , diphenhydramine , magnesium aluminium hydroxide ) morphine mouthwash randomize trial ; compare 1 % 2 % morphine solution open trial . The result show significant decrease duration pain , intensity well decrease need systemic analgesia group morphine mouthwash . No systemic clinically relevant adverse effect note . Hypothesis : Mouthwashes morphine contain solution decrease oral pain substantially , cause side effect see systemic administration narcotic analgesic . Method : A randomised double-blind cross-over study evaluate effect topical oral application 0.2 % morphine solution patient suffer radio- and/or chemotherapy induce oral mucositis . 60 patient include . Randomly assign either morphine solution placebo mouthwash , receive first three day one solution switch treatment three day . General basic oral care offer patient . Efficacy treatment measure self-assessment pain scale . Doses systemic opioids symptom ( appetite , dysphagia ) also measure . If patient 's n't receive systemic opioids , serum concentration morphine measure .</brief_summary>
