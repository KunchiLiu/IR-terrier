	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) Treatment Acute Pain From Bunionectomy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo bunionectomy often experience moderate severe acute pain post-surgery . Normally pain controlled patient receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . However , opioid therapy commonly associate side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , constipation , less frequently , respiratory depression . Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) , newly synthesize drug immediate release ( IR ) formulation , also act centrally acting analgesic dual mode action . The aim study investigate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) 2 dose level tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR compare drug ( placebo ) one dose level oxycodone ( opioid commonly use treat post-surgical pain ) . This study randomize , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment receive ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate treatment acute pain bunionectomy . The study include blind 72 hour inpatient ( patient stay facility procedure do ) phase immediately follow bunionectomy , patient treat either 50- 75-mg tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR , placebo , 10-mg oxycodone IR , pain relief periodically assess . Assessments pain intensity ( PI ) pain relief ( PAR ) obtain use numerical rating scale , patient global impression change scale ( PGIC ) measure overall patient status . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . Venous blood sample collect determination serum concentration tapentadol ( CG5503 ) oxycodone . The study hypotheses least one tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR dose different placebo control patient pain 48 hour , follow establish least one tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR dose non-inferior compare oxycodone IR ( oxycodone IR clinically significantly good tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR dose ) . A comparison incidence rate adverse event nausea and/or vomiting , incidence rate adverse event constipation , tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR oxycodone IR also perform . Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR 50 75 mg , oxycodone 10 mg , placebo , 1 capsule take mouth every 4 6 hour 72-hour postsurgery phase study ( acetaminophen also allow first 12 hour Day 1 , need pain ) . All dos study treatment take approximately 120 mL water without food .</detailed_description>
