	<brief_title>Stress Medication Effects Cocaine Cue Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress cocaine cue produce crave ultimately relapse cocaine dependent individual . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate effect either guanfacine ( Tenex ) modafinil ( Provigil ) stress cue induce crave cocaine dependent individual . Cocaine dependence assess adult ( age 18-65 ) define DSM-IV criterion . If subject sign consent form , meet study criterion meet exclusion criterion include study . Subjects report General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) , outpatient visit receive first dose study medication . The following day subject return GCRC admit duration study ( two day one night ) . There one-week one-month follow-up visit . Subjects randomly assign one two treatment group ( guanfacine placebo ) . Each subject also randomly assign either stress no-stress subgroup . On test day ( day 3 ) subject stress group ask perform speech math problem front audience ( Trier Social Stress Test , TSST ) , no-stress group ask sit quietly read . Following task , subject expose neutral ( control ) cue immediately afterwards subject expose cocaine cue ( cocaine paraphernalia ) . Craving/mood , physiological activity , endocrine response , assess pre-set interval throughout test procedure . The cue reactivity protocol repeat one-week follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . Subjects must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) GCRC admission . Because high comorbidity alcohol marijuana use cocaine dependence , individual meet dependence alcohol marijuana include . Individuals require medical detox alcohol exclude . Subjects must consent random assignment stress vs. stress drug treatment condition . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . Modafinil inhibit metabolism steroidal contraceptive via CYP3A4 reduce effectiveness type birth control , female subject must use one follow method birth control : barrier method ( diaphragm condom spermicide ) , surgical sterilization , use intrauterine contraceptive device , complete abstinence sexual intercourse . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular ( include limit leave ventricular hypertrophy ( unless cardiologist deems clinically significant ) , mitral valve prolapse , leave bundle branch block , myocardial infarction , angina ) , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect HPA axis function . Subjects liver function test ( LFTs ) great two time normal , compromise liver function interfere HPA axis activity ( Williams Dluhy 1987 ) may affect drug metabolism . Subjects Addison 's disease , Cushing 's disease diseases adrenal cortex likely affect HPA axis function . Subjects history current psychotic disorder bipolar affective disorder may interfere HPA function . Subjects current major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder disorder associate characteristic change HPA axis function . Subjects receive synthetic glucocorticoid therapy , exogenous steroid therapy , treatment agent interfere HPA axis function within one month time test . Subjects take psychotropic medication , opiate opiate antagonist may affect HPA axis function.Participants take SSRI 's include . Subjects require take medication could adversely interact study medication , include , limited , azole type antifungal , cyclosporine , warfarin , theophylline , carbamazepine . Any medication induce inhibit CYP3A4 pathways exclude , modafinil metabolize enzyme system . Subjects acute illness fever may affect HPA axis activity . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . Subjects grossly obese ( BMI &gt; 39 ) , may interfere HPA axis function . Subjects unwilling unable maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) prior stress task procedure . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence ( nicotine , cocaine , alcohol marijuana ) within past 60 day .</criteria>
