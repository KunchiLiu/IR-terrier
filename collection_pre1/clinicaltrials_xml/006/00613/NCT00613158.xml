	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , include heart disease , heart attack , high blood pressure , stroke , commonly cause atherosclerosis , harden artery . Traditional risk factor CVD include age , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , smoke . Although establish risk factor helpful determine people risk develop CVD , addition novel gene marker subclinical , suspect , atherosclerosis ( SA ) may enhance CVD risk prediction understand disease mechanism . This study compare specific gene white blood cell people significant SA versus people without SA improve identification risk develop CVD good understand biological basis SA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Differences Peripheral Blood Leukocyte Gene Expression Determine Cardiovascular Disease Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CVD lead cause death worldwide account almost 40 % deaths year United States . In person CVD , oxygenate blood adequately distribute throughout body impaired function heart blood vessel . This restrict blood flow eventually lead organ damage , heart attack , stroke . Risk prediction CVD , largely associate SA , relies use certain traditional risk factor . The widely use Framingham risk score ( FRS ) provide excellent risk discrimination reliable estimate 10-year risk CVD , account genetics behind SA . Although numerous study investigate novel genetic biomarkers attempt add predictive value FRS , single biomarker date able improve risk prediction meaningful way . A multi-marker approach identifies several novel marker unrelated traditional risk factor may effective improve identification risk CVD . This study first construct multi-marker approach base pattern gene expression peripheral blood leukocyte ( PBLs ) serve identify people substantial SA . The study use approach determine whether gene expression pattern PBLs people SA distinct people without SA . This study use previously collect data specimen , include blood sample SA imaging , participant Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) trial healthy female participant Northwestern University . Blood sample use analysis pattern gene expression PBLs . There new study visit study . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
