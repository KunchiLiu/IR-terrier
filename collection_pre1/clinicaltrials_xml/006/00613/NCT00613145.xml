	<brief_summary>This phase I , randomize , safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study sorafenib give combination capecitabine . The study enroll two simultaneous cohort ; patient randomly assign either Cohort A Cohort B . A third cohort ( C ) may add protocol later date .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pharmacokinetics/Safety Sorafenib + Capecitabine Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Cycle 1 , patient receive capecitabine alone first 7 day ( Cohort A receive 750 mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily , Cohort B receive 1000 mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily first 7 day Cycle 1 ) . For day 8-14 Cycle 1 , patient receive capecitabine ( 750 mg/m2 twice daily Cohort A ; 1000 mg/m2 twice daily Cohort B ) combine sorafenib ( 400 mg twice daily cohort ) ; day 15-21 Cycle 1 , patient receive sorafenib alone ( 400 mg twice daily cohort ) . Beginning day 1 Cycle 2 treatment cycle thereafter , patient dose follow : Cohort A receive sorafenib orally 400 mg twice daily 21 day , capecitabine orally 750 mg/m2 twice daily first 14 day 21-day treatment cycle . Cohort B receive sorafenib orally 400 mg twice daily 21 day , capecitabine orally 1000 mg/m2 twice daily first 14 day 21-day treatment cycle . After 6 patient enrol Cohort A Cohort B , one two cohort enroll additional 6-12 patient expansion phase .</detailed_description>
