	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving treatment surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give combination chemotherapy together intensity-modulated radiation therapy work treat patient undergo surgery locally advance rectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether incidence neoadjuvant acute gastrointestinal toxicity ( grade ≥ 2 ) associate neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy reduce inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) -based radiation treatment compare conventionally deliver radiotherapy , utilized capecitabine oxaliplatin arm RTOG-0247 ( NCT00081289 ) . Secondary - To evaluate feasibility perform IMRT cooperative group set treatment rectal cancer . - To estimate incidence toxicity ( hematologic non-hematologic ) associate protocol treatment neoadjuvant period , adjuvant period , overall . - To estimate pathologic complete response rate follow neoadjuvant IMRT-based chemoradiotherapy . - To estimate time treatment failure pattern failure . - To correlate pre- post-treatment level serum cytokine symptom pathological outcome follow neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy rectal cancer . - To evaluate rate abdominoperineal resection . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy pelvis daily , 5 day week , 5 week ( total 45 Gy ) 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy boost gross disease daily 3 day ( total 45 Gy ) . Beginning first day radiotherapy continue completion radiotherapy , patient receive oral capecitabine twice daily , 5 day week , 5 week oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . - Surgery : Within 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo resection rectal tumor . - Adjuvant chemotherapy : Beginning 4-8 week surgery , patient completely resect disease negative surgical margin receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV bolus day 1 fluorouracil IV infusion continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month start treatment 2 year , every 6 month year 3-5 , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
