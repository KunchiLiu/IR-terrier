	<brief_summary>The purpose research project study effect non-ablative ( non-cutting ) laser therapy , technique us laser energy try improve appearance skin . This type laser treatment create change layer skin call dermis without cause open wound skin . The use non-ablative laser therapy , together application photo-sensitizer ( substance make skin sensitive light ) , may improve appearance acne . The idea behind photo-sensitizer suppose make laser effective use laser alone . It yet clear much improvement see treatment exactly skin 's response cause improvement . In study , interested learn well laser work improve symptom acne , well much photo-sensitizer actually enhance efficacy laser . The photo-sensitizing agent ( Levulan Kerastick ) non-ablative laser ( LumaCare LC-122M non-coherent ( multiple wavelength ) light source LumaCareÂ® Medical Products ) FDA-approved . The Levulan Kerastick approve treatment another skin disease , acne .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Treatment Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Acne vulgaris remain among common cutaneous disorder , impact vast majority people point life . It associate significant psychosocial morbidity , remain need efficacious low risk therapeutic option . The FDA approve various laser light source treatment acne . However , randomize , control clinical trial perform device . In addition , use topical photosensitizers precede laser light-therapy acne also examine preliminary way initial evidence efficacy . However , trial small modest number subject , many focus back acne , treatment protocol vary widely often poorly control . Photodynamic therapy facial acne perform physician across country little objective data regard practice available . We recently conduct trial 1 hour application common photosensitizer approve FDA acne phototherapy ( Levulan , DUSA pharmaceutical ) use pulse dye laser therapy ( V-Beam laser , Candela Corp. , Wayland , MA , 595 nm wavelength ) activate light source ( IRB protocol 2005-0117 ) . Interim result study indicate therapy effective minority patient . Accumulating publish report data suggests limit effectiveness protocol may due inadequate skin penetration photosensitize agent due need activate light source longer wavelength light allow deep penetration skin . We wish incorporate finding design protocol effective treatment facial acne . Objectives We propose evaluate efficacy confirm safety FDA-approved non-coherent light source ( LumaCare LC-122M non-coherent light source LUM-I , fiber optic probe , 610 nm-660 nm output range , LumaCare Medical Products , Newport Beach , Ca ) use conjunction topical photosensitizer ( Levulan , DUSA pharmaceutical ) treatment acne vulgaris . Because one propose mechanism action treatment include altered sebaceous gland activity , also seek examine effect treatment cutaneous sebum production .</detailed_description>
