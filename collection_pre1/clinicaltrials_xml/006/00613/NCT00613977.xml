	<brief_title>Comparison Two Fetal Lung Maturity Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale/Background : This pilot study prospective cohort analysis two method currently available institution determination fetal lung maturity ( FLM ) use amniotic fluid . The investigator wish explore cost time save potential two available test . The test utilized determination FLM evaluation phospholipid amniotic fluid . In particular institution , relationship surfactant albumin ( S/A ratio ) analyze use measure fluorescent polarization call FLM II procedure perform TDx TDxFLx chemical analyzer commercially available Abbott Labs . This test time-consuming available institution . Lamellar body lamellated phospholipid represent storage form surfactant ( 1 ) . Because lamellar body diameter ( range , 1-5 Âµm ) similar small platelet , lamellar body count ( LBCs ) obtain rapidly use platelet channel hematology analyzer . The investigator wish compare difference cost time result determine FLM LBC method FLM II . Our hypothesis time result significantly less use LBC method , cost associate method traditional FLM II favorable . Extensive research show efficacy analyze fetal lung maturity use lamellar body ( 2-11 ) . Since efficacy method establish , adequacy lamellar body count comparison FLM II question study . While study speculate cost time saving would exist , literature find answer precise question . The author feel information could benefit medical community economic standpoint . Amniotic fluid collect time amniotomy term cesarean section send OSUMC laboratory FLM analysis use LBC FLM II . Our hypothesis time result cost use LBC method substantially less . Methodology Mechanism Testing At present , FLM test Oklahoma State University Medical Center ( OSUMC ) perform TDx-FLM chemical analyzer manufacture Abbott Labs . Most laboratory use Abbott FLM-II assay assess fetal lung maturity follow manufacturer 's recommendation interpret surfactant albumin ratio . Thus , value great 55 mg/g consider mature value less 40 mg/g immature . McElrath et al. , report probability respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) 15 % less achieve S/A ratio cutoff 60 mg 28 week gestation , 50 30 week , 40 33 week , 30 35 week , 20 37 week ( 12 ) . Lamellar body test many hospital instrument use hematology test institution . The ADVIA 2120 ( Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics , Tarrytown , NY ) , flow cytometry system function identify count specific cell body fluid , use OSUMC laboratory hematology body fluid . Although use LBC institution , certainly capability accord manufacturer ( 13 ) . Neerhof et . al , recently describe change threshold particular institution . The level maturity increase 30,000 50,000 LB/ul . This result significantly few neonatal intensive care unit admission RDS ( 14 ) . An algorithm FLM test first utilize LBC publish Ventolini et al . This algorithm picture Figure 1 ( 15 ) . We incorporate algorithm cost analysis indeterminate LBC value would require FLM II procedure , thus elevate cost patient . Amniotic fluid obtain operate surgeon assistant amniotomy make . At least 2 ml amniotic fluid require test . The fluid hand wait nursing personnel . Once amniotic fluid obtain , LBC S/A ratio send laboratory stat order . Laboratory personnel record time specimen check lab time result available , standard protocol . These time use calculate time difference LBC S/A ratio . The patient identify assigned medical record number hospital . Details LBC protocol use ADVIA 2120 find Table 1 . We record result study . When indeterminate level obtain use lamellar body count , cost performing FLM II procedure add lamellar body count cost particular patient . The amount would charge patient use calculate cost saving sample size . We compare cost LBC , LBC TDxFLM ( require algorithm ) , TDxFLM alone . Study Population : The study population include ten term gestation schedule either repeat cesarean section ( C/S ) primary C/S malpresentation . Term define 37 complete week base sure last menstrual period first trimester ultrasound crown rump length measurement . Consent obtain either resident clinic morning schedule procedure . The resident investigator one obstetrical resident OSUMC consent patient.. The resident participate consent give instruction regard consent process well inclusion/exclusion criterion . The cost laboratory test approximately $ 45 per patient . The sample size limit research grant $ 500.00 provide Osteopathic Founders Foundation . Other fund application expansion project likely future . Inclusion Criteria : - Term intrauterine gestation beyond 37 completed week date calculated sure last menstrual period ( LMP ) use Negel 's rule utilize first trimester crown rump length ultrasound . - Women previous C/S schedule repeat C/S . - Women undergo schedule C-Section malpresentation Exclusion Criteria : - Presence gross blood amniotic sample - Hematocrit count great 1 % ADVIA 2120 - Presence meconium sample - Patients oligohydramnios define amniotic fluid index le 5 cm polyhydramnios define amniotic fluid index 24 cm . Early Termination Criteria : If reason investigator obstetrician perform C/S believe patient fetus may harm extra time require amniotic fluid collection ( albeit short ) , patient may remove study without consent . The volunteer would also right terminate participation study terminate investigator ' right use collect fluid analyze result time . Collection Sheet Appendix C `` Lamellar Body Data Collection Sheet '' use collection storage data . All information de-identified collection , storage retrieval information . Data Collection Only principle investigator ( ) access patient ' data collection sheet . Individual physician involve care specific patient access patient 's information . All individual compliance HIPPA guideline set forth university medical center . Treatment decision base result data collect study . The following information obtain patient chart entry data collection sheet . 1 . Maternal age 2 . Gravity/Parity 3 . Estimated Gestational Age figure 4 . Maternal complication - diabetes , hypertension , PIH , coronary vascular disease , thyroid disease , thrombophilia , 5 . Date collect 6 . Time collect 7 . Time receive 8 . Time report - FLM , LB 9 . Difference total time 10 . FLM result - mature , intermediate immature 11 . LB result - mature , intermediate immature 12 . Cost FLM 13 . Cost LB No data collect patient chart . The resident investigator assist collection data qualification basic human research HIPPA train fall OSU - CHS community individual privilege . Further , physicians resident direct access current patient chart medical management determine need fluid collection assist patient consent . Analysis : An algebraic expression use determine procedure time cost effective . Let P proportion LBC 's conclusive result . Let X denote attribute LBC ( say cost time ) let Y denote attribute FLM II . The following equation ask question `` cost associate perform FLM II great cost associate LBC FLM II backup ? '' Cost ( time ) LBC FLM II back &lt; Cost ( time ) FLM II X &lt; P*Y In word : Using LBC beneficial proportion conclusive result great proportion cost LBC FLM II . Confidentiality : All record lab result maintain Oklahoma State University Medical Center , department medical record laboratory storage hospital 's Meditech system . Research analysis data collection sheet de-identified maintain Department Ob/Gyn secure location 717 South Houston Ave , Tulsa OK 74127 .</detailed_description>
