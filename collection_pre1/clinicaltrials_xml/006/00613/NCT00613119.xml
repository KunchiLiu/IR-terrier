	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image measure receptor brain involved inflammation . Certain neurological disorder , possibly include frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) , associate increased inflammation brain . This study may help elucidate relationship FTD inflammation . Patients FTD healthy volunteer 35 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Whole body PET scan : PET us small amount radioactive chemical call tracer label active area brain activity see special camera . The tracer use study [ 11C ] PBR28 . Before start scan , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm inject tracer . Pictures take 1 hour . This short scan do determine [ 11C ] PBR28 bind subject receptor , since number people bind . Subjects bind continue brain PET MRI scan , describe . - Brain PET imaging : Before start scan , catheter place vein arm inject tracer , &lt; TAB &gt; another catheter place artery wrist obtain blood sample scan . The subject lie scanner bed . A special mask fit head attach bed help keep person head still scan image clear . An 8-minute transmission scan do tracer inject provide measure brain helpful calculate information subsequent scan . After tracer inject , picture take 2.5 hour , subject lie still scanner bed . - Blood urine test do day day follow PET scan . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : An MRI scan do within 1 year ( ) PET scan . This procedure use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The subject lie table move scanner ( tube-like device ) , wear earplug muffle noise machine scan process . The test take 1 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Evaluation Brain Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors Using 11CPBR28 Frontotemporal Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Abnormal immune response inflammatory mechanism implicate pathogenesis certain neurodegenerative disease . Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) neurodegenerative disease characterize focal atrophy frontal temporal lobe . Evidence support presence inflammation FTD ; however , relationship inflammation FTD pathogenesis poorly understood . In addition , evidence inflammation temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) , condition characterize seizure originate mesial temporal lobe . In response brain inflammation , microglia activate over-express peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) . In normal condition , PBR express low number . Measuring PBR density identify area brain inflammation , activate microglial cell area express PBR microglial cell rest condition . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image quantify PBR density vivo use radioligands bind PBR site . One PBR-specific radioligand , [ 11C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) , use identify area brain inflammation patient FTD . Unfortunately , [ 11C ] PK11195 several limitation , low brain uptake low specific signal . A recently develop radioligand , [ 11C ] N-acetyl-N- ( 2-methoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ( PBR28 ) , high affinity [ 11C ] PK11195 PBR . [ 11C ] PBR28 never use study inflammation FTD . To study brain inflammation dementia TLE , wish include patient Alzheimer disease ( AD ) TLE . Study population : In protocol , wish evaluate 20 patient FTD , 50 100 patient AD , 20 patient TLE , 30 55 healthy volunteer . Design : Subjects undergo dedicate brain PET [ 11C ] PBR28 , well brain MRI . In AD patient control , 11C PBR28 PET MRI repeat interval one year 5 year . Outcome measure : Outcome measure amount 11C PBR28 bind brain FTD patient , AD patient , TLE patient healthy control . We quantify radioligand brain uptake , washout , plasma clearance , distribution volume use compartmental modeling . Distribution volume proportional density receptor equal ratio equilibrium uptake brain concentration parent radiotracer plasma . 11C PBR28 binding also compare baseline follow-up scan determine change binding related evolution AD pathology relate normal aging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients diagnosis Alzheimer disease frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . FTD patient without motor involvement may include . FTD patient either frontal variant ( also know behavioral variant ) language variant FTD may include . AD FTD patient must either meet capacity criterion consent research , able assign surrogate decisionmaker able consent research subject behalf . TLE patient must clinically document partial seizure consistent EEG evidence define 1981 International Classification Epileptic Seizures , refractory standard antiepileptic treatment least one year . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic , necessary , inpatient videoEEG monitoring . Healthy volunteer .
