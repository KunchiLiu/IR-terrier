	<brief_summary>Stroke third lead cause death industrialized country first cause handicap adult . Several stroke risk factor identify high blood pressure , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia cardiac arrhythmia . Sleep respiratory disorder find frequent among patient stroke . Among obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) syndrome seem important due association high blood pressure atrial fibrillation . Stroke responsible central apnea , therefore differential diagnosis central apneas pure OSA stroke sometimes difficult . The misidentification OSA explain poor tolerance CPAP treatment patient . The purpose present study investigate association pre-stroke OSA syndrome OSA diagnose specific scale confirm polygraphic study stroke occurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>• Principal Objective : Investigate association obstructive sleep apnea diagnose hemispheric ischemic stroke • Secondary Objective : Evaluate relation obstructive sleep apnea : - stroke mechanism - stroke prognosis - post-stroke tolerance CPAP treatment . - Study design : Prospective case-control study • Inclusion criterion : Patients ( 150 ) : Fist ischaemic hemispheric stroke TIA Age : 50 90 French native speaker Able answer question Controls ( 600 ) : Age : 50 90 French native speaker Able answer question • Exclusion criterion : Patients Haemorrhagic stroke Stroke brainstem Past medical history ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable give inform consent Controls : Past medical history ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable give inform consent • Study plan : Cases recruit stroke unit Pr Orgogozo Bordeaux University hospital . After verification inclusion exclusion criterion Berlin scale measure . A polygraphic study perform patient Berlin scale &gt; 2 . Patients stroke characteristic record ( initial severity , stroke mechanism ) baseline stroke outcome evaluate 3 month ( stroke recurrence functional outcome ) . Controls recruit among sex age match patient hospitalize Bordeaux-University hospital investigation non-vascular disorder . After verification inclusion exclusion criterion Berlin scale measure . A polygraphic study perform subject Berlin scale &gt; 2 . Controls evaluate 3 month use phone interview • Number subject : 150 case 600 control</detailed_description>
