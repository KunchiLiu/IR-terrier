	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn symptom gastrointestinal lesion associate take myfortic® switch patient delayed release formulation develop alleviate GI symptom . A comparison frequency severity GI symptom observe patient treat MMF ( cellcept® ) conversion myfortic® measure use self-assessed questionnaire call Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) . To prove incidence improvement GI lesions patient treat MMF ( cellcept® ) conversion myfortic® measure use Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy ( SBCE ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy Findings Patients Receiving Cellcept®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myfortic® recently introduce market show similar MMF effectively work well tolerate . Both drug active ingredient , different way deliver body . Myfortic® advance , enteric coat formulation mycophenolate sodium ( EC-MPS ) delay release active ingredient , MPA . MPA potent effect lymphocytes cell . This make improved GI tolerability MPA therapy .</detailed_description>
