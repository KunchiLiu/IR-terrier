	<detailed_description>Moderate alcohol consumption consistently associate lower risk develop type two diabetes mellitus compare abstainer heavy drinker . However , physiological mechanism know . Two potential mechanism investigate study explain finding observational study : One concern acute change upon alcohol consumption ( cephalic phase reflex ) could explain observed improvement postprandial glycemia alcohol consumption ; metabolic change prolong moderate alcohol consumption gene expression adipose tissue might lead improved insulin sensitivity . Both mechanism discuss . Cephalic phase reflex Mere exposure smell , sight , taste textural attribute food elicits myriad digestive , endocrinologic , thermogenic , cardiovascular renal response . These response rapid ( generally occur minute sensory stimulation ) , small ( relative magnitude achieve food actually metabolize ) transient ( retuning baseline level within minute ) . They term pre-absorptive cephalic phase reflexes/responses ( CPR ) refer set food intake-associated autonomic endocrine response stimulation sensory system mainly locate oropharyngeal cavity . Their function may essential adaptive , prepare digestive system reception , digestion absorption ingest nutrient . The release cephalic phase hormone occur activation vagal efferent fiber response food-related sensory stimulus . Pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) hormone almost exclusively vagal control increase . Thus , cephalic phase PP response sensitive indicator vagal activation food stimulus . PP level rise 100 % baseline individual taste , chew expectorate food magnitude cephalic phase insulin release relatively small ( 25 % baseline ) . The cephalic phase consider reflex rather response dependent neural rather nutrient-induced stimulation . The physiological significance cephalic phase hormonal response demonstrate experimental manipulation inhibit bypass cephalic phase insulin release . Under circumstance , hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia evident . Alcohol consumption lower postprandial glucose concentration improve insulin secretion . Furthermore , alcohol consumption increase postprandial diet-induced thermogenesis , heart rate cause diuresis presumably result inhibition vasopressin . Since postprandial state , almost cephalic phase response affect alcohol , seem plausible human body might exhibit CPR upon oral sensory stimulation alcohol-containing beverage . This study therefore investigate first time extent alcohol trigger CPR may account improved postprandial glycemia see alcohol consumption . Gene expression adipose tissue Application transcriptomics technology , via gene expression profiling , use microarrays powerful expensive tool identify molecular pathway responsible metabolic regulation . Gene expression profile human intervention study , allow genome wide screening effect specific diet nutrient result biomarker profile . Recently , use detect new important signaling pathway involve glucose lipid metabolism . Adipose tissue important metabolic endocrine function . Changes function associate increased low-grade inflammatory state chronic disease obesity diabetes . Furthermore , change gene expression profile subcutaneous adipose tissue observe nutritional intervention . An important hormone almost exclusively abundantly secrete adipose tissue adiponectin . Circulating adiponectin level lean person far hormone . It believe high level adiponectin protect lean person decrease obesity associate low grade inflammation development insulin resistance diabetes . Research group show moderate alcohol consumption increase plasma level mRNA adiponectin level . This suggest moderate alcohol consumption , directly indirectly , exerts effect adipose tissue gene expression . Since adiponectin associate inflammatory status , lipid metabolism insulin sensitivity , change gene expression pathway expect alcohol consumption reflect adipose gene expression . Beneficial effect moderate alcohol consumption might apparent lean overweight person . Compared overweight men , lean men strong increase adiponectin 'good ' HDL cholesterol moderate alcohol consumption . Furthermore , liver enzymes obese subject elevate moderate alcohol consumption indicate less favorable response moderate alcohol consumption among overweight person . Since current rise obesity pandemic , different response lean obese subject alcohol consumption great importance . Thus , investigate alcohol-induced change gene expression adipose tissue lean overweight subject could highly valuable identification new biomarkers could also pivotal importance identify specific physiological mechanism lead improved insulin sensitivity reduce inflammatory status . This eventually could help general understanding development diet-related chronic disorder obesity type two diabetes .</detailed_description>
