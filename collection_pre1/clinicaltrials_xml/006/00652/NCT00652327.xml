	<brief_summary>This randomize , open label , parallel group comparison study . Following 1-week screening period , patient randomize 1 2 treatment group : ezetimibe add ongoing statin treatment ( ezetimibe plus simvastatin , atorvastatin pravastatin dose 10/20 , 10/10 10/20 mg ) , double dose ongoing statin ( simvastatin 40 mg , atorvastatin 20 mg , pravastatin 40 mg ) . Study drug administer daily even 8 week . Patients instruct follow National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) similar cholesterol-lowering dietary regimen throughout study .</brief_summary>
