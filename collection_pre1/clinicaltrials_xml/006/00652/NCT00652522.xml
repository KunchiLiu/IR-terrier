	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common sustain cardiac arrhythmia affect 5 % people older 65 year . It associate 5 time increase risk stroke patient receive anticoagulant therapy double rate death patient . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) often co-exist , one condition promote development worsens condition . It purpose study show benefit endocardial catheter ablation pulmonary vein isolation patient persistent ( minimum 1 week maximum 1 year duration ) longstanding persistent ( minimum 1 year maximum 4 year ) atrial fibrillation , low LVEF ( &lt; =35 % ) require ICD CRT-D therapy compare best medical treatment antiarrhythmic drug . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 fashion unblinded , parallel arm treatment format either drug therapy ( directed rate rhythm control ) catheter ablation . All therapy establish optimized 3 month treatment initiation phase ( Blanking Period ) start randomization . For morbidity mortality end-points , intention-to-treat analysis begin randomization . Efficacy respect AF treatment establish long-term follow begin 3-month initiation phase . Improvement LVEF within 12 month primary endpoint study . The transthoracic echocardiographic ( TTE ) assessment enrollment , discharge 12 month follow-up follow standardize protocol . The assessment analyze , calculate expressed independent Core Lab .</detailed_description>
