	<detailed_description>1.0 Introduction : Head &amp; Neck squamous cell carcinoma commonest cancer afflict develop country . Traditionally surgery radiotherapy alone early stage surgery postoperative radiotherapy advance stage mainstay treatment . Of late paradigm shift management cancer , particularly oropharynx laryngopharynx , chemoradiation advocate part organ preservation protocol good outcome . Conventional radiotherapy involve use 2 3 field technique without compensators encompass volume risk radical dos 66-70 Gy typically need sterilize gross disease . This strategy however associate considerable acute morbidity ( mucositis , dysphagia , dermatitis ) debilitate late toxicity ( xerostomia ) . Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) potential improve dose distribution , increase dos target volume reduced dos surround normal structure , thereby improve therapeutic ratio . 2.0 Objectives : 2.1 To compare major salivary gland spar 3-D CRT vis-Ã -vis IMRT ass adequacy target volume coverage conformal technique . 2.2 To determine pattern local loco-regional recurrence . 2.3 To determine Disease Free Survival ( DFS ) &amp; Overall Survival ( OAS ) 2.4 To study quality life patient 2.5 To assess reduction dose IMRT normal larynx &amp; normal pharyngeal constrictor oropharyngeal cancer , uninvolved oral mucosa middle &amp; inner ear apparatus oropharyngeal &amp; laryngopharyngeal cancer 3.0 Patient Selection : 3.1 Eligibility 3.1.1 Biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx laryngopharynx . 3.1.2 . AJCC stage T1-3 , NO-2b , MO patient pre-treatment tumor measurement clinically well CT/MRI scan . 3.1.3 Surgery primary tumor limit excisional incisional biopsy . 3.1.4 No form neck dissection nodal metastasis . 3.1.5 KPS &gt; 60 ( see appendix I ) . 3.1.6 Age &gt; 18 &lt; 65 year . 3.1.7 No prior history therapeutic irradiation . 3.1.8 Patient willing reliable follow-up . 3.1.9 Patient 's nutritional &amp; physical condition compatible plan therapy . 3.1.10 Signed study specific consent form ( see Appendix II ) . 3.2 Ineligibility criterion : 3.2.1 Evidence distant metastasis . 3.2.2 Previous therapeutic irradiation head &amp; neck cancer invasive cancer squamous basal cell carcinoma skin . 3.2.3 History prior malignancy . 3.2.4 Prophylactic use amifostine pilocarpine . 3.2.5 Active untreated infection like tuberculosis , preclude use systemic chemotherapy would interfere completion treatment . 3.2.6 Any histopathology Squamous Carcinoma . 3.2.7 Primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma . 3.2.8 Age &lt; 18 &gt; 65 year . 3.2.9 Pregnancy lactate woman . 4.0 Pre-treatment evaluation : 4.1 All patient require complete follow prior start therapy : 4.1.1 Complete history physical examination include weight height . 4.1.2 . Complete diagrammatic descriptive documentation extent disease , primary regional follow appropriate endoscopic procedure . 4.1.3 Complete dental nutritional evaluation . All dental repair do least one week prior start therapy . 4.1.4 Completion follow laboratory investigation : CBC , LFT , RFT , TFT , baseline speech assessment audiometric assessment . 4.1.5 Completion follow radiological investigation : CXR , CT/MRI head &amp; neck volumetric assessment , Planning scan contrast ( unless otherwise contraindicate ) 3mm contiguous slice appropriate immobilization system . A PET scan CT-PET hybrid scan may do discretion treat physician ( Appendix III ) . Bone scan liver scan per clinical indication . 4.1.6 Salivary scintigraphy parotid gland . 4.1.7 A baseline QOL questionnaire ( Appendix IV ) fill patient . 5.0 Radiation therapy : 5.1 Treatment planning , image &amp; localization requirement . 5.1.1 Immobilization : In supine position customize thermoplastic device . 5.1.2 Planning scan : Contrast enhance plan CT scan area interest 3mm slice CT-simulator network treatment planning system ( Cadplan ) . 5.1.3 Target delineation : Planning target volume ( GTV CTV ) organ risk volume ( spinal cord parotids ) contour slice . Other organ uninvolved oral mucosa , middle &amp; inner ear normal larynx &amp; pharyngeal constrictor oropharyngeal cancer also contour slice . An isometric margin 5mm provide CTV final PTV 3mm organ risk plan organ risk volume ( PORV ) . The GTV include primary involved neck node . The delineation various volume per consensus guideline . The priority constraint IMRT plan also decide case case basis ( see appendix V detail ) . 5.1.4 Prescription : The goal treatment plan would encompass PTV subclinical disease dose 60-54 Gy conventional fractionation equivalent GTV 70 Gy equivalent spar much aforesaid critical structure possible without compromise GTV . Primary target ( gross disease margin ) dose 70 Gy conventional fractionation equivalent ( 70 Gy/35 # /7 week 3-D CRT ad 66 Gy/30 # /6 week IMRT ) . The secondary target ( sub-clinical disease ) dose 50-54 Gy conventional fractionation equivalent ( 50-54 Gy/28-30 # /5.5-6 week 3-D CRT 54 Gy/30 # /6 week IMRT ) . An optional secondary target area may define area high risk disease ( e.g . first echelon node ) . This shall receive 60 Gy/30 # /6 week 3-D CRT IMRT . The maximum permissible point dos spinal cord limit 40 Gy . All patient plan 3-D CRT well IMRT , irrespective final treatment protocol . 3-D CRT planning do Cadplan/Eclipse ( Varian , USA ) use multileaf collimator ( MLCs ) beam shape . IMRT plan do use Helios inverse planning module Cadplan/Eclipse . Treatment deliver Varian LINAC ( 2100 CD 6 Ex ) use dynamic MLCs ( slide window technique ) . 5.1.5 Plan evaluation : Comparative evaluation bease 3-D CRT IMRT plan individual patient do . Cumulative dose volume histogram ( DVHs ) compute PTV PORV assist plan evaluation . Plans compare respect conformal avoidance organ risk , conformity index , homogeneity index DVHs . An detail evaluation quality assurance ( Appendix VI ) dosimetric method involve procedure would also carry correlated final outcome . 6.0 Other therapy : 6.1 Chemotherapy : Concurrent platinum base chemotherapy consider patient T3 N+ disease . 6.2 Cytoprotectors : Use amifostine pilocarpine allow . 7.0 Patient assessment : 7.1 Patients assessment table ( see Appendix VII detail ) . 7.2 Evaluation 7.2.1 Every follow visit : All patient require follow 6weeks 12 week end radiotherapy , Thereafter follow visit would schedule three monthly first two year annually thereafter . Routine head &amp; neck examination , include endoscopic examination perform first follow-up thereafter need , performance status , weight , toxicity QOL documentation carry follow-up . Salivary scintigraphy , swallow status , speech assessment , thyroid function test audiometry do first follow-up post treatment six monthly thereafter . Follow-up PET scan do discretion treat physician . Dental care provide need . 7.2.2 Other study : CXR persistent cough , hemoptysis chest pain ; skeletal survey bone scan case bone pain biopsy suspicious lesion upper aero-digestive tract . 7.2.3 Objective response criterion ( see Appendix VIII ) . 7.3 Criteria removal treatment 7.3.1 Progression disease treatment 7.3.2 Withdrawal consent patient 7.3.3 Severe radiation morbidity result break 2 week . 8.0 Data Collection : 8.1 Summary data submission ITEM DUE Demographic form Within 2 week study entry Initial Evaluation form 1 week RT start Diagnostic Pathology Report Before RT start Baseline QOL assessment 1 week start treatment Radiotherapy form Within 1 week end RT Adverse Event form ( see appendix IX detail ) Initial follow-up form At 6 week end RT Follow-up form At 3 , 6 &amp; 12 Months end RT Long term follow-up form Yearly 5 year Autopsy report If need 8.2 Summary RT QA requirement ( see Appendix VI detail ) : Preliminary Dosimetric Information Within 1 week start RT Simulation &amp; Port film Every week Final Dosimetric Information Within 1 week end RT Hard copy isodoses DVH total plan include charge 9.0 Statistical consideration : 9.1.1 The primary end point acute salivary gland toxicity ( &gt; = Gr 2 ) per RTOG toxicity criterion ( see Appendix X &amp; XI ) . This also assessed salivary scintigraphy subjectively patient self-assessment . As surrogate dose volume histogram shall use assessment major salivary gland spar . 9.1.2 Secondary endpoint include : ) Local &amp; Loco-regional control b ) DFS &amp; c ) OAS 9.2 Patient accrual , sample size &amp; analysis : 60 patient . 9.2.1 Approximately 85 % patient conventional technique 3-D CRT would develop acute salivary gland toxicity grade 2 . With IMRT , hypothesize could reduce 50 % . The total number patient need would fifty-four assume alpha error 0.05 beta error 0.20 ( one tail test ) . The project 3 year locoregional control rate group 70 % . Ensuring salivary gland spar expense loco-regional control , upper limit locoregional failure rate set 45 % per Fleming 's one step multiple test procedure . In case exceed anytime interim analysis , entire protocol shall re-examine . 9.2.2 Sixty patient accrue 24 month period date start 9.2.3 Interim analysis toxicity accrual data plan every six month .
