	<brief_summary>This study fourth time candidate malaria vaccine Merozoite Surface Protein - long synthetic chain , test malaria endemic populations.in past , test adult twice child prove safe three occasion phase IIb study child proceed . This study include child randomly allocate either receive malaria vaccine adjuvanted Aluminium Hydroxide Verorab control . Each participant receive 3 immunization , without clinical investigator participant know give . They followed-up immediate reaction vaccination , extend safety profile immunological response associate protection malaria . These child follow long term two year . Blood take evaluate biological safety parameter also immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity , Efficacy Safety Study MSP3-LSP ( Long Synthetic Peptide ) Malaria Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled phase IIb study evaluate immunogenicity , efficacy safety Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate , Merozoite Surface Protein-3 Long synthetic peptide ( MSP3 ) adjuvanted aluminium hydroxide versus Verorab control healthy child age 12-48 month Mali A phase Ib trial currently ongoing Burkina Faso well Tanzania interim result inform best dose/adjuvant combination safely extend young child . The trial evaluate immunogenicity , efficacy safety 3 dose 30 µg MSP3 adjuvanted aluminium hydroxide Primary objective : - To assess efficacy MSP3-LSP : - Determine efficacy MSP3-LSP child age 12-48 month clinical malaria episode ( Axillary temperature ≥ 37.5ºC P. falciparum parasitemia ) occur consecutive malaria transmission season third vaccination ( six month third vaccination ) . Secondary Objectives : - To assess safety reactogenicity 3 dose 30 µg MSP3 adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide give D0 , D28 D56 healthy child age 12-48 month old Mali . - To assess IgG ability recognize native protein Merozoite use Western Blot ( WB ) method , measure efficacy among subgroup individual able react parasite protein WB . - To assess humoral immune response vaccine antigen use ELISA . - Determine efficacy MSP3 child age 12-48 month first clinical malaria episode . - To assess efficacy MSP3-LSP child age 12-48 month clinical malaria episode occur ensue TWO year Exploratory Objectives : To characterize MSP3 vaccine efficacy measuring : - Relationship efficacy serological response induce vaccine - Duration protection period two year - Vaccine efficacy disease define various parasite threshold [ 500 , 2500 , 5000 , 10,000 20,000/µL ] - Vaccine efficacy severe malaria disease - Vaccine efficacy anaemia - To evaluate functionality IgG use ADCI technique - To assess cellular T-helper type 1 immune response vaccine antigen Elispot , persistence 24 month follow-up The primary evaluation include follow : Solicited adverse event measure day 0 day 7 dose ; Unsolicited adverse event measure one month dose ; Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) measure 12 month study duration . Passive active case detection use capture adverse event include clinical malaria episode . After third dose . All participant go schedule clinic visit day 84 , 168 , 365 , 540 730 clinical assessment . Children follow two year follow first vaccination . During scheduled visit malaria smear hemoglobin do systematically day 0 , 28 , 56 , 84 , 168 , 365 , 540 730 . The humoral immune response vaccine antigen assess use ELISA day 0 , 28 , 56 , 84 , 168 , 365 , 540 730 . Cellular immune response vaccine antigen assess day 0 , 56 , 84 , 168 , 540 730 use Elispot MSP3-LSP . The functionality induce immune response use Western Blot ( WB ) method ADCI technique evaluate day 0 , 84 , 168 , 365 , 540 730 . Biological safety : two four week vaccination , thereafter every 12 week , reference baseline first dose , measure follow RBC , hemoglobin , hematocrit , platelet , WBC differential count , ASAT , ALAT , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , γGT , creatinin . Statistical method : Descriptive method shall employ evaluate criterion .</detailed_description>
