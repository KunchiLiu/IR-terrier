	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose pilot study determine efficacy oxymorphone hydrochloride propoxyphene/acetaminophen combination prolong time onset pain reduce severity pain associate walking patient lumbar spinal stenosis clinical symptom neurogenic claudication . Neurogenic claudication define movement induce leg pain , numbness , heaviness , vague discomfort part one leg provoke walk stand relieve sit , squat , forward flexion posturing . The secondary objective examine functional benefit oxymorphone hydrochloride propoxyphene/acetaminophen combination respect improvement duration distance walking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Stenosis Outcomes Research II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A computer-generated randomization plan use assignment subject one six treatment sequence ( 4 subject per sequence ) : oxymorphone/propoxyphene/placebo , oxymorphone/placebo/propoxyphene , placebo/oxymorphone/propoxyphene , placebo/propoxyphene/oxymorphone , propoxyphene/oxymorphone/placebo , propoxyphene/placebo/oxymorphone . One dose blind study drug ( opana , propoxypehen , placebo ) give study day 1 , 5 , 9 . The primary endpoint time first symptoms moderate intensity ( NRS ≥ 4/10 ) treadmill ambulation . Ambulation assessment perform screening visit . Ambulation assessment also perform 90 minute administration study drug day 1 , 5 9 , evaluate pain intensity associate walk well distance cover patient . Quantitative assessment ambulation conduct treadmill 0° ramp incline 1.2 mile per hour ( mph ) . Measurement self-reported symptom severity use NRS baseline , every 30 second maximum 15 minute record . The following information also record : time first symptom , total ambulation time . The examination stop 15 minute onset severe symptom . Severe symptom define level discomfort would make patient stop walk usual life situation . No one encourage prompted continue walk beyond point . Patients instructed walk upright posture . They permit lean forward hold onto handrail examination . Secondary outcome measure include area curve present pain intensity ambulation specify time point , final pain intensity walking , walk tolerance , time return baseline pain level ambulation , well result series pain related questionnaire include : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Patient Global Assessment ( PGA ) , NRS , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) , modify Brief Pain Inventory short form ( mBPI-sf ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , Swiss Spinal Stenosis ( SSS ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must present clinical symptom neurogenic claudication ( exercise induce leg pain , numbness , heaviness , vague discomfort part one leg provoke walk stand relieve sit , squat , forward flexion posturing ) endorse limitation walk tolerance due symptom Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain ≥ 6 response follow question : `` Circle one number ( 0=no pain 10=worst pain ) How would rate worst leg low back pain experience walk last week ? '' Patients must confirmatory image MRI CT scan demonstrate least one level lumbar spinal stenosis within 1 year Duration symptom &gt; 3 month Age &gt; 50 year ; male female Past present existence movement disorder , e.g. , Parkinsonism , neurologic disease might affect ability ambulate ( e.g. , signs/symptoms cauda equina compression ) Cognitive impairment prevent full understanding participation study Peripheral vascular disease Moderate severe arthritis knee hip might severely compromise ambulation Past present low extremity peripheral vascular disease Serious concomitant medical illness ( e.g. , heart disease ) might impair ambulation assessment Previous lumbar surgery spinal stenosis ( laminectomy without fusion ) within past 2 year epidural steroid injection precede 4 month . Severe psychiatric disorder Mean time severe symptom &gt; 15 minute .
