	<brief_summary>This trial design prospective , multi-center , randomize , feasibility clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy Thrombi-Gel absorbable surgical hemostat . Within clinical evaluation , Thrombi-Gel compare current standard care , gelatin sponge ( Gelfoam ) plus Thrombin JMI , use 2:1 randomization ratio . Subjects randomize one two ( 2 ) treatment group . One ( 1 ) group treat Thrombi-Gel , one ( 1 ) group treat gelatin sponge plus thrombin . All study data analyze accord subject ' assign randomization group assignment , regardless treatment actually deliver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Absorbable Surgical Hemostatic Agent : Thrombi-Gel® Versus Gelfoam-Thrombin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , multi-center investigation minimum seventy five ( 75 ) study subject design evaluate safety effectiveness Thrombi-Gel product absorbable hemostat surgical patient population . Subjects undergoing orthopedic/spinal , general , cardiac , hepatic vascular surgical procedure consider investigation . Subjects pre-screened utilizing standard care data specify inclusion/exclusion criterion ensure eligible treatment investigation . If subject appear qualify investigation , subject ask give his/her write informed consent . If , surgery , surgeon encounter bleed site unable unwilling easily control due failure impracticality conventional method ( suture and/or cautery ) , subject may enrol randomized receive either investigational control treatment . If subject multiple bleeding site , site maximum 5 site , may treat assigned surgical hemostat . However , first site treat used determine study objective . All subject follow hospitalization . A follow-up evaluation conduct approximately 30 60 day post-procedure determine long-term effectiveness hemostatic treatment receive , incidence late adverse event , interim immunologic response study treatment device . Follow-up evaluation include obtain blood specimen evaluate antibody development , coagulation , Factor Va test . Blood sample send independent labs analysis . From baseline final study exam , data pertain investigational objective record appropriate case report form predetermine study interval . The investigation conduct minimum five ( 5 ) site , fifteen ( 15 ) site .</detailed_description>
