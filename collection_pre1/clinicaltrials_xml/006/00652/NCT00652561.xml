	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study S-1 2nd Line Therapy Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced non-small cell lung cancer relatively unresponsive chemotherapy . This true nucleoside analogue gemcitabine , response rate approximately 10 % , well 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Even gemcitabine combine chemotherapeutic drug biological agent , overall tumor response rate remain basically unchanged . S-1 new generation oral fluoropyrimidine combine Tegafur ( 5-fluoro-1- ( tetrahydro-2-furanyl ) -2,4 ( 1H,3H ) -pyrimidinedione [ FT ] ) , oral prodrug 5-FU , two modulators , Gimeracil ( 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [ CDHP ] ) , inhibit 5-FU degradation dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) inhibition , Oteracil potassium ( Oxo ) , inhibit 5-FU phosphorylation digestive tract . This combination 3 compound design achieve enhance antitumor activity decrease gastrointestinal toxicity . This open-label , multicenter , single-arm , 3-stage , Phase 2 study evaluate efficacy safety single agent S-1 2nd line therapy patient advance NSCLC . The 3 stage study correspond futility stage ( stage 1 ) , decision stage ( stage 2 ) , stage improvement precision ORR ( stage 3 ) .</detailed_description>
