	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety tolerability paclitaxel carboplatin give combination Avastin patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . Objectives : Primary study goal : To investigate safety tolerability carboplatin paclitaxel administer IP combination IV Avastin To determine Avastin influence pharmacokinetics IP administer chemotherapeutic agent Secondary study goal : To determine systemic exposure paclitaxel carboplatin initial late cycle IP dose . To collect overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) To determine change IP VEGF level To determine site first recurrence Information CA-125 response clinical response descriptive secondary goal study Exploratory goal : To estimate proportion patient complete entire course treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel Carboplatin With IV Avastin Therapy Patients With Carcinomas Mullerian Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Paclitaxel design block mechanism cell division cancer cell , may cause die . Avastin design prevent slow growth cancer cell block effect VEGF , blood-vessel stimulating agent play important role growth normal abnormal blood vessel . Intraperitoneal Port ( IP ) Placement : If find eligible take part study , need IP port , call intraperitoneal catheter tube , place abdomen . The catheter use give paclitaxel carboplatin directly abdomen . You may already catheter place previous surgery . If , minor surgical procedure operate room place . You ask sign separate surgical consent form describe procedure , risk involve , step take care catheter place . Study Drug Administration : You receive 6 cycle treatment study drug . Each cycle 21 day ( 3 week ) long . Cycle 1 : You receive paclitaxel carboplatin needle vein Day 1 . Paclitaxel give first follow carboplatin . Both drug give 1 hour . On Days 8 15 receive paclitaxel vein . This infusion also give 1 hour . Cycle 2 : On Day 1 , 2 cup normal saline infuse abdomen IP catheter . This infusion take 30-60 minute . You receive paclitaxel IP port abdomen . When paclitaxel infusion complete , receive carboplatin IP port . Each infusion take 1 hour . After chemotherapy infusion complete , another 2-4 cup normal saline infuse port . This do help move chemotherapy area abdomen . You ask change position frequently . On Day 8 , 2 cup normal saline infuse abdomen IP catheter . You receive paclitaxel IP port abdomen 1 hour . While receive paclitaxel IP port , also receive Avastin vein . The first dose Avastin give 90 minute . If tolerate first infusion well , second infusion ( give Cycle 3 ) may give 60 minute . If 60-minute infusion well-tolerated , infusion may give 30 minute . After paclitaxel infusion complete , receive another 2-4 cup normal saline port . You ask change position frequently . On Day 15 , 2 cup normal saline infuse abdomen IP catheter . You receive paclitaxel IP port abdomen . After paclitaxel infusion complete , receive another 2-4 cup normal saline port . You ask change position frequently . Cycles 3-6 : On Day 1 , 2 cup normal saline infuse abdomen IP catheter . You receive paclitaxel IP catheter 1 hour . After complete paclitaxel , receive carboplatin IP catheter 1 hour . After infusion complete receive another 2-4 cup normal saline port . You ask change position frequently . While undergo IP therapy paclitaxel carboplatin , also receive second infusion Avastin vein . The length infusion depend well tolerate drug first time give Cycle 2 . On Days 8 15 , 2 cup normal saline infuse abdomen IP catheter . You receive paclitaxel IP port abdomen 1 hour . After paclitaxel infusion complete , receive another 2-4 cup normal saline port . You ask change position frequently . Before receive paclitaxel carboplatin , receive drug dexamethasone vein help decrease risk study drug side effect . You may also receive drug ( cimetidine diphenhydramine ) vein help side effect , nausea allergic reaction . The choice drug use doctor . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record , include list drug take . - You ask well able perform normal daily activity ( performance status evaluation ) . - You physical exam , measurement vital sign , neurological exam . - You ask side effect experience . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test ( repeat Days 8 15 cycle well ) . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check CA125 level treatment start Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 . Before treatment start Cycle 1 Day 8 Cycle 2 Day 1 Cycles 3-6 , urine collect routine test . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycles 1 , 2 , 4 , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) draw 12 different time day pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) also draw 1 time Days 2 3 Cycles 1 , 2 , 4 . On Day 8 Cycle 2 Day 1 Cycles 3 , 4 , 6 paclitaxel start , level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) abdominal fluid measure . VEGF protein cause fluid build-up ( ascites ) abdomen . About 2 cup normal saline infuse IP port . You ask change position 15 minute . Then 3-4 tablespoon fluid remove port syringe . This show Avastin affect abdominal fluid . You also blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check level VEGF blood . Length Study : You may remain study 6 cycle . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : Once study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check CA125 level . Long-Term Follow-Up : After last study visit , contact every 3 month check . You return clinic ( come M. D. Anderson regular care ) researcher call phone ask question . Your doctor tell standard test procedure need perform . This investigational study . Avastin , carboplatin , paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment many type cancer . At time , addition Avastin paclitaxel carboplatin use treat ovarian cancer research . Up 46 patient take part multicenter study . Up 15 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
