	<brief_title>Dasatinib Resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug Dasatinib design decrease activity one proteins responsible uncontrolled growth tumor cell . This may cause tumor cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 2 dasatinib tablet mouth 2 time day 4 week surgery ( morning 12 hour later ) . Dasatinib may take without food , swallow least 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . A light meal require , may help avoid get stomach ache take dose . Tablets must swallow whole may break . If vomiting occurs within 30 minute swallow tablet ( ) , take another dose . If miss dose dasatinib , take soon remember day . If miss take dose 12 hour , take regular dose next schedule day ( take double regular dose make miss dose ) . You give `` pill diary '' write take study drug . You show fill ask bring diary clinic visit . Study Visits : On Days 21 28 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You also test check amount oxygen blood . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You performance status evaluation . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . - You PET scan check status disease . This PET scan surgery , study doctor tell perform . Surgery : After take dasatinib 28 day , surgery remove tumor . You continue take dasatinib midnight night surgery . Depending status disease , either pleurectomy extrapleural pneumonectomy . You give separate consent procedure , describe surgery risk detail . Pleurectomy surgical procedure remove parietal pleura ( outermost lining around lung ) . An extrapleural pneumonectomy surgical procedure remove portion lung , parietal pleura ( line lung ) , pericardium ( line heart ) , diaphragm . During surgery , 5-6 core biopsy , possible , take different area tumor biomarker test . For CT-guided core biopsy lung , tissue sample withdrawn organ suspect tumor mass use thin needle syringe . The needle guide view physician CT scan . Length Study : After surgery , doctor decide type treatment receive condition . If disease respond well 4 week dasatinib , may eligible continue take dasatinib day start 4-6 week surgery . The doctor may also decide take dasatinib day start 4-6 week receive radiation therapy . You may continue take dasatinib long benefit . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . Follow-up Visits : If continue receive study drug surgery , physical exam PET CT scan every 8 week . If take study reason , continue follow study team see . This investigational study . Dasatinib investigational agent ongoing clinical trial use drug malignant mesothelioma . However , study recently start , information far show drug effective malignant mesothelioma . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment acute lymphoid chronic myeloid leukemia . However , use research study investigational . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
