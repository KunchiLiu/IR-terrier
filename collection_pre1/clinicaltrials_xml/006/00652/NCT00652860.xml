	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . GM-CSF may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . GM-CSF , give inhalation , may interfere growth tumor cell prevent metastasis form . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy GM-CSF surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy GM-CSF surgery work treat patient stage III soft tissue sarcoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate 2-year pulmonary metastatic progression rate patient primary high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma receive preoperative I-MAP , plus aerosol GM-CSF , plus irradiation concomitant MAP follow post-operative aerosol GM-CSF . Secondary - To evaluate survival patient . - To evaluate time progression patient . - To evaluate toxicity patient . - To evaluate tumor response patient . Translational - To observe describe sequentially treatment , treatment , recovery treatment frequency skin test anergy cellular immunity extremity soft tissue sarcoma receive systemic GM-CSF preoperatively aerosol GM-CSF part preoperative postoperative treatment . OUTLINE : - Neoadjuvant treatment : Patients receive ifosfamide IV 2 hour day 0 1 cisplatin IV 4 hour , mitomycin IV doxorubicin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) every 12 hour day -6 -3 , 2-14 , 22-25 . Beginning day 84 patient also undergo radiotherapy daily , five day week , continue five week . Patients also receive GM-CSF SC twice daily day -3 2 -15 aerosol GM-CSF twice daily day 85 - 91 , 99 -105 , 113 - 119 . - Chemoradiotherapy : Beginning 4 week completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy , patient undergo radiotherapy ( RT ) daily , 5 day week , 5 week . Patients also receive aerosolize GM-CSF twice daily day 2-8 , 16-22 , 30-38 mitomycin C IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 29 . - Surgery : Four week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo surgery . Patients may also undergo intraoperative RT electron boost intraoperative high-dose brachytherapy . - Adjuvant treatment : Beginning 4 week surgery , patient receive aerosol GM-CSF twice daily day -7 , 15-21 , 35-42 , 56-63 , 77-84 . Some patient may undergo external beam RT 2-4 week surgery . Blood sample collect baseline 4 14 week surgery . Samples test NY-ESO-1 staining , T-cell subset flow cytometry , autologous lymphocyte proliferation . Patients may also test delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test anergy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , 5 year .</detailed_description>
