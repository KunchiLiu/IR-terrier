	<brief_title>Hepatectomy With Without Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Stage IIIA Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common malignancy world , prevalence increase United States . Hepatectomy still consider potentially curative treatment HCC . Unfortunately , long-term survival hepatectomy still unsatisfactory high incidence tumor recurrence , especially intrahepatic recurrence . Stage IIIA hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) include multiple tumor 5 cm tumor involve major branch portal hepatic vein ( ) International Union Against Cancer ( UICC ) TNM stag liver tumor , sixth edition 2002 . Until controversy management Stage IIIA HCC . According Barcelona -Clinic-Liver-Cancer ( BCLC ) proposal , Stage IIIA HCC represent intermediate advanced disease . The European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) recommend randomize controlled trial chemoembolization new agent stage disease . Whereas Asian area , China Japan , partial hepatectomy reductive surgery ( without adjuvant therapy ) perform multiple advanced HCC tumor major branch portal hepatic vein ( ) invasion , although prospective study assess therapeutic efficacy safety . On hand , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) widely use primary treatment unresectable HCC . It also use optional treatment relapse disease . However , efficacy TACE use adjuvant therapy follow hepatectomy remain controversial . Neither large randomize controlled trial address field . Therefore , randomize control trial perform cancer center compare hepatectomy adjuvant TACE hepatectomy alone Stage IIIA HCC .</detailed_description>
