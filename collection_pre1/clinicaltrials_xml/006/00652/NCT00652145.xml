	<brief_summary>The propose study test whether increase Lialda dose reduce fecal calprotectin ( FCP ) level , marker intestinal inflammation highly predictive risk relapse among patient quiescent ulcerative colitis . Sixty patient FCP level &lt; 50µg/g stool observe 48 week . All patient FCP concentration measure use commercially available assay enrollment , 6 week 12 week . All patient persistently elevate FCP receive one follow intervention : change mesalamine formulation Lialda and/or increase dose Lialda . Reduction FCP level 50µg/g stool 6 week randomization primary outcome . The proportion patient achieve outcome compare group use Fisher 's exact test . All randomized patient well exclude randomize trial low FCP concentration baseline follow week 48 determine rate clinical relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Remission ( DEAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among patient quiescent ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , low fecal concentration calprotectin associate low rate relapse . We perform open-label , randomize control trial investigate whether increase dos mesalamine reduce concentration fecal calprotectin ( FC ) patient quiescent UC . We screen 119 patient UC remission basis Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score , FC &gt; 50 µg/g , intake 3 g/day mesalamine . Participants take mesalamine formulation multimatrix mesalamine switch multimatrix mesalamine ( 2.4 g/day ) 6 week ; 52 participant randomly assign ( 1:1 ) group continue current dose mesalamine ( control , n = 26 ) group increase dose 2.4 g/day 6 week ( n = 26 ) . The primary outcome continue remission FC &lt; 50 µg/g . Secondary outcome continue remission FC &lt; 100 µg/g &lt; 200 µg/g ( among patient pre-randomization value level ) .</detailed_description>
