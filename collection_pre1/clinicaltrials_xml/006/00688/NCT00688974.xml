	<brief_summary>Wight loss surgery provide good glycemic control type 2 diabetes . The technique `` Roux-en-Y gastric bypass '' effective `` Adjustable Gastric Band '' weight loss . This longitudinal cohort study compare effectiveness Roux-en-Y gastric bypass Adjustable Gastric Banding glycemic control type 2 diabetes explore responsible mechanism . The evaluation make preoperatively 1 year later assess decline HbA1c . An evaluation also carry weight loss 10 % indicate whether observed difference independent weight loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Cohort Study Comparing 2 Surgical Techniques Patients With Class 3 Obesity Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes condition often associate obesity often difficult control . In patient severe obesity , surgical treatment allow sustainable weight loss higher obtained treatment available . In case , surgery also reduce significantly comorbidities obesity diabetes particular . Among various technical option , adjustable gastric band ( AGB ) simple far used France . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) complicate intervention combine gastrointestinal malabsorption- duodeno-jejunal gastric reduction allow high weight loss . Several study also suggest technique remarkable efficiency glycemic control , justify extension readings/indications . No study control , however , compare two technique . The objective study compare efficiency RYGB v AGB glycemic control type 2 diabetes . Although study compare AGB RYGB , none compare effectiveness post prandial glucose control patient diabetes . It generally recognize effectiveness RYGB diabetes independent weight loss , never demonstrate . By demonstrate superiority RYGB v AGB , identify responsible mechanism , study expand indication RYGB treatment type 2 diabetes . Weight loss surgery offer unique model clinical study pathophysiology type 2 diabetes . Main objective : - To compare effectiveness RYGB v AGB glucose control obese patient type 2 diabetes . Secondary Objectives : - demonstrate well outcome achieve RYGB independent weight loss . - Identify mechanisms underlie well outcome RYGB</detailed_description>
