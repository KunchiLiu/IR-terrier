	<brief_title>Correlation Between Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) FLT Uptake Gene-Expression Oncotype Assay Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several publication address role PET image biological characterization breast cancer . A modest significant correlation report tumor grade FDG uptake . Few study report positive correlation SUV Ki-67 label index malignant breast tumor . Others correlate p53 expression breast cancer FDG uptake . F18-Fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine ( FLT ) develop PET marker cellular proliferation develop image cell proliferation finding correlate strongly Ki-67 label index breast cancer . A 10-minute FLT-PET scan acquire two week end first course chemotherapy , show two recent study useful predict longer-term efficacy chemotherapy regimens woman breast cancer . In current study FDG FLT uptake ratio correlate risk score result Oncotype gene-expression assay patient clinically negative nodal disease plan surgical removal tumor . It hypothesis since high uptake tracer implies aggressive behavior rapid tumor growth , might well patient high risk score Oncotype high uptake PET tracer low risk score show low-intensity uptake value . If case , might well patient non-conclusive oncotype result ( intermediate score ) FDG FLT uptake measurement allow dichotomy 1 . Patients intermediate score Oncotype high uptake PET tracer , suggestive aggressive behavior 2 . Patients intermediate score Oncotype low uptake PET tracer suggest less aggressive behavior .</detailed_description>
