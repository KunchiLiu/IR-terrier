	<brief_summary>Background : - Relapse drug abuse think result , many case , exposure cue trigger drug-related memory emotional association example , association sight crack pipe set response rapid heartbeat desire cocaine . This type memory reconsolidated ( actively re-stored ) time reactivate ; however , reconsolidation process disrupt drug propranolol , weaken link memory emotional response . - Propranolol traditionally use treat high blood pressure heart-related condition . Researchers interested study whether propranolol disrupts reconsolidation drug-cued memory individual addict cocaine . Objectives : - To examine whether propranolol interfere reconsolidation cocaine-related memory reduce craving drug use substance abuser . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age current cocaine user enrol methadone treatment program . Design : - The study involve four long session ( visit 1 , 4 , 6 , 14 ) 10 short session . The short visit monitor participant use drug alcohol ; longer visit involve test lab session . Participants randomize either propranolol placebo group . - The long session involve follow procedure : - An interview session develop personalized drug script/cue set . - A two-hour intervention session baseline measure , drug administration ( propranolol placebo ) , two script-guided imagery set . This administration propranolol study . - Two follow-up test session , 1 5 week intervention session . - Participants make brief visit outpatient clinic twice-weekly monitoring ongoing drug use via urine screen self-report , start 1 week intervention session end 5 week later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Relapse drug abuse addiction think result , many case , exposure cue elicit drug-related memory . The term memory use everyday sense , sense corresponds closely emotional association example , association sight crack pipe set response rapid heartbeat desire cocaine . Studies rodent human show type memory reconsolidated ( actively re-stored ) time reactivate , reconsolidation process disrupt propranolol . Such disruption erase autobiographical memory event , instead weaken link memory emotional response . Human study need determine whether propranolol disrupts reconsolidation drug-cued memory addict individual ; would present novel excite therapeutic possibility prevent crave relapse . Objective To examine whether administration propranolol interfere reconsolidation cocaine-related memory reduce craving drug use substance abuser . Study population Up 200 ( 60 evaluable ) individual maintain methadone use cocaine recruit local treatment program . The target enrollment include 40 % woman 60 % minority . Experimental design method Participants randomize one two group : propranolol ( 40 mg , oral , immediate-release formulation ) placebo . The study include four laboratory session : ( 1 ) An information-gathering session include interview obtain information development personalize drug script/cue set . ( 2 ) A two-hour intervention session baseline measure , drug administration ( propranolol placebo , double blind ) , , start 60 min drug administration , two script-guided imagery set . Cue-responsivity data collect , main purpose session interventional . This administration propranolol study . ( 3 , 4 ) Two follow-up test session , 1 5 week intervention session ; participant responses re-exposure personalized drug script/cue set measure . In addition attend four laboratory session , participant make brief visit outpatient clinic twice-weekly monitoring ongoing drug use via urine screen self-report , start 1 week intervention session end 5 week later . Outcome measure Outcome measure include subjective rating drug craving , autonomic response ( heart rate , blood pressure , galvanic skin response ) , cocaine heroin use ( urine drug screen self-reported drug use ) .</detailed_description>

Medical condition would contraindicate administration propranolol ( e.g. , uncompensated congestive heart failure ; pulmonary edema ; asthma ; COPD ; history severe allergic reaction ( seasonal , environmental , food , medication , etc . ) ; Raynaud disease ; second thirddegree atrioventricular block ; arrhythmia sinus arrhythmia ; thyroid dysfunction ; diabetes mellitus ; renal impairment . Per American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) , COPD Clinical assessment base medical history physical examination . Although complete examination indicate patient , two component specifically important patient suspect COPD . ( ATS &amp; ERS , 2004 ) Accordingly , medical history physical exam suggest possible COPD participant forward spirometry/pulmonary function test aid diagnosis . 9 .
