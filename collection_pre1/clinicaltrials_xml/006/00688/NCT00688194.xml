	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant exemestane , anastrozole , letrozole may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell lower amount estrogen body make . Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether fulvestrant effective without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study fulvestrant without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy compare well work treat postmenopausal woman metastatic breast cancer progress previous aromatase inhibitor therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With Without Lapatinib and/or Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Progressed After Previous Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival postmenopausal woman progressive metastatic breast cancer treat fulvestrant without lapatinib tosylate and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy . Secondary - To compare time progression patient . - To compare overall survival patient . - To compare response rate patient . - To compare clinical benefit rate patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord time progressive disease ( adjuvant therapy v &gt; 12 month completion adjuvant therapy v treatment metastatic disease ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 0 , 14 , 28 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive oral placebo daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive fulvestrant placebo arm I . Patients also receive aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy ( e.g. , exemestane , anastrozole , letrozole ) accord standard treatment regulation . - Arm III : Patients receive fulvestrant arm I oral lapatinib tosylate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm IV : Patients receive fulvestrant arm I lapatinib arm III . Patients also receive AI therapy accord standard treatment regulation .</detailed_description>
