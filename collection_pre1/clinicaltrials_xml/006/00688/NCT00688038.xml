	<brief_title>Correlation MR Thermal Imaging Actual Size Ablation During Laser Ablation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser ablation design destroy tumor tissue use fiber optic place directly tumor deliver laser light energy tissue . In study , tumor destruction check use MRTI . MRTI similar MRI technique , instead provide image data , MRTI provide temperature data cancerous area body laser ablation process . If tumor temperature measure accurately , laser ablation process may safer . Laser Ablation MRTI Scan : If find eligible take part study , day laser ablation , intravenous ( IV ) line place . You receive sedation general anaesthesia ( drug make sleep ) needle vein 1-3 hour lessen pain may procedure . This process explain . After receive anaesthesia , follow test procedure perform : - You limited MRI . - Your skin clean cover sterile towel sheet low chance infection . - The doctor use MRI scan place special needle ( applicator ) tumor . This applicator use create heat high enough temperature cell destroy . Small mass may destroy 1 treatment , large mass may require needle place several time . Each heat cycle take less 10 minute . - During laser ablation , MRTI use monitor temperature within ablation zone . The MRTI process similar regular MRI . - Your heart rate blood pressure measure entire procedure . - The entire procedure may take 1-3 hour , depend size location tumor . After procedure complete , keep hospital 4-6 hour observation . You check recovery sedation receive procedure . Once recovered procedure , allow leave hospital . If side effect procedure , doctor may decide keep hospital long time period observation . Follow-Up Visits : After complete procedure , return M. D. Anderson follow-up visit . About one ( 1 ) week laser ablation , physical exam X-ray . About one ( 1 ) month laser ablation , physical exam limit MRI check status disease . Length Study : You consider off-study 1-month follow visit . This investigational study . The laser ablation procedure FDA-approved procedure . The device commercially available use outside research study . The investigational part study involve use MRTI check effect ablation tumor . Up 24 participant enrol study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
