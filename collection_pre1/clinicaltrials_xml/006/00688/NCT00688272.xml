	<brief_summary>This study design investigate safety profile photoirritant potential eltrombopag healthy subject . The study placebo- positive control , randomize , parallel group three treatment arm : eltrombopag ( 75 mg QD ) , placebo , positive control ( ciprofloxacin , 500 mg BID ) . Eltrombopag administer double-blind fashion respect placebo positive control , ciprofloxacin , administer observer-blinded condition . Twelve fifteen subject recruit arm , assure total enrollment 36 evaluable subject . The primary endpoint photosensitize potential eltrombopag measure photoirritant index ( PI ) change minimum erythemal dose ( MED ) comparison placebo .</brief_summary>
