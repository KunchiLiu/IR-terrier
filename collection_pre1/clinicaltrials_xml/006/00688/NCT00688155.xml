	<detailed_description>Evidence small uncontrolled study indicate physical exercise cognitive training considerable promise prevention strategy , extent often recommend ; however , efficacy establish adequately power randomized clinical trial . This pilot study provide experience data ass whether physical activity cognitive training separately improve cognitive function 6 month . It also determine whether combination intervention hold promise beyond individual intervention without compromise adherence , provide information necessary design well-organized efficient full scale , multi-center randomized clinical trial . The Physical Activity Training ( PAT ) consist center-based home-based session include aerobic , strength , flexibility , balance training . The actual time spend exercise vary person person also vary depend stage study . The Cognitive Training ( CT ) intervention develop improve consciously-controlled memory processing recollection episodic memory information produce change performance transfer executive function , work memory , plan memory monitoring , well long term item memory cognitive processing speed . The Healthy Aging Education ( HAE ) control combine health education-based lecture light stretch tone . HAE include experiential component , participant learn take charge health seek appropriate medical service information . Topics medication , foot care , travel nutrition cover .</detailed_description>
