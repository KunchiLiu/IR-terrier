	<brief_summary>NMDA receptor brain receptor stimulate glutamate . Poorly function NMDA receptor think involved pathology schizophrenia . This hypothesis base observation PCP , block NMDA receptor , produce symptom cognitive impairment similar schizophrenia . Efforts enhance function NMDA receptor glycine D-cycloserine meet limited success . An alternative approach would use drug acamprosate . Acamprosate , FDA-approved maintenance sobriety detoxification alcohol , seem act modulation NMDA receptor . In lab , acamprosate note act antagonist NMDA receptor maximally stimulate agonist NMDA receptor stimulation minimal . This `` smart drug '' action make acamprosate appealing use schizophrenia . If acamprosate work smart drug patient , would predict would enhance function NMDA receptor schizophrenia improve cognition symptom illness . Additionally , acamprosate seem modulate NMDA receptor novel way distinct glycine D-cycloserine . We also see response acamprosate differs base whether participant past history alcohol use disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Study Acamprosate Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose measure response symptom cognition people schizophrenia give acamprosate placebo . We hypothesize symptom cognition improve follow two week acamprosate . We also use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) examine effect acamprosate glutamate &amp; glutamine ( Glu &amp; Gln ) brain level people schizophrenia . We hypothesize Glu &amp; Gln concentration people chronic schizophrenia increase follow two week treatment acamprosate . The propose study consist 50 individual chronic schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder , 18-55 year old , in/outpatient program Maryland Psychiatric Research Center ( MPRC ) . The dose acamprosate follow manufacturer recommendation two 333mg tablet give three time per day . MRS acquire area involve schizophrenia [ dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ] baseline week two . Symptom rating cognitive test occur baseline repeat week two .</detailed_description>
