	<detailed_description>RATIONALE . HIV infection result alteration intestinal tract , even clinically healthy patient . Changes may include pronounced CD4 T-cell loss , enteric nerve smooth muscle degeneration , abnormal enterocyte morphology , alter gene expression pattern , increase intestinal permeability , decrease absorptive capacity . Recently find HIV infection may also result abnormal low-level leakage lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , gram-negative bacterial product ) gut circulation promote systemic immune activation . As immune activation strong positive correlate HIV disease progression , may important develop effective mean improve intestinal barrier function HIV infection . Evidence also exist uninfected individual African descent may higher intestinal permeability uninfected Caucasians , suggest intestinal dysfunction event HIV infection could differ two race . With regard gender , woman show display pronounce inflammatory response LPS compare men . Intriguing research outside HIV field use animal model compromise gut barrier function also use human subject trauma- disease-associated intestinal leakage show oral administration certain probiotic bacteria 1 ) Reduce bacterial translocation , 2 ) Reduce bacterial infection , 3 ) Decrease inflammatory cytokine , 4 ) Improve survival . Thus , probiotic could offer important benefit HIV infect patient improve intestinal function reduce subsequent microbial translocation immune activation . These benefit may vary race . OBJECTIVE . To determine effect oral synbiotic supplement ( Synbiotic 2000 ) plasma LPS level , systemic immune activation , blood CD4 count HIV infect woman . HYPOTHESIS . Oral treatment HIV+ patient synbiotic supplement improve intestinal barrier function , decrease translocation LPS circulation , result reduce systemic immune activation improve CD4 count . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN . 30 HIV+ female subject randomize test supplement placebo undergo baseline blood draw establish initial value plasma LPS , immune activation marker , blood CD4 count . Following daily ingestion test supplement placebo 4 week , subject undergo second blood draw measurement factor . Subjects also provide stool specimen begin end 4 week period .</detailed_description>
