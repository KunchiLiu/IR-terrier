	<brief_summary>In stroke rehabilitation , unilateral training impaired limb stroke often frequent strategy use bilateral one . However , clinical need bilateral training support evidence show unilateral training impaired limb automatically restore bimanual coordination function . Increased focused needed develop robot-assisted therapy train impaired arm bilaterally unilaterally . Controlling robot often difficult require well understand couple effect leave right hand stroke . There need develop robot-assisted therapy device address couple uncoupled bimanual movement well symmetry well asymmetry context human bimanual action along intermanual division labor various ADL task . This study focus bilateral training use bio-inspired control algorithm understand impairment recovery Bimanual Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) stroke subject term arm kinematics . Healthy subject hemiplegia due stroke cerebral palsy evaluate member research team ask perform battery task test viability usability bilateral robot system call BiADLER , allow patient complete daily task vary level assistance adapt task performance individual subject 's performance . Subjects provide feedback researcher observation thought therapy device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects may video-taped photographed follow session . Part A : Participation part study include follow step : 1 ) Informed Consent : After arrival , subject review sign consent form study personnel present . 2a ) Pre-Assessments : A member research team evaluate subject ' affected arm ass ability use . Subjects evaluate use battery assessment order determine level impairment Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer , Montreal Cognitive Assessment , Box Block , grip strength use dynamometer , etc . 2b ) Break : Subjects give 15 minute break . 2c ) Subjects ask use Bilateral Activities Daily Living Exercise Robot ( Bi-ADLER ) 60 minute . All subject seat Bi-ADLER ask perform battery bimanual evaluation task ( draw oval , standard ADL task like pour , reaching , drink etc ) . A total three trial ( 1 min less ) do evaluation task 5 min break give two task . His/her kinematic data perform corresponding evaluation task compare healthy baseline predict level impairment . During portion experiment , controller provide assistance patient . This take total 25-30 min . After controller engage assistance provide patient perform battery task complete first half session . This take another 25-30 min . Part B : For subject invite participate Part B study - low mid function Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) stroke survivor eligible -participation part study include follow step : 1 ) Informed Consent : After arrival , subject review sign consent form study personnel present . 2a ) Pre-Assessments : If subject participate Part B study , first visit , member research team evaluate affect arm ass ability use . Subjects evaluate use battery assessment order determine level impairment Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer , Montreal Cognitive Assessment , Box Block grip strength use dynamometer , etc . If study subject participate Part A , reevaluate therapist long evaluation do within month Part B . 2b ) Break : Subjects give 15 minute break . 2c ) Bi-ADLER train robot 50-60 minute . In part protocol , subject come lab 10-12 session . In session , subject performs different activity daily Living task ( like pouring , drink etc ) Bi-ADLER 50-60 min 5 min break every15 min . This part contingent subject complete Part A protocol . During final session ( 10th - 12th session ) , battery task Part A performed subject . There also clinical evaluation end session evaluate clinical score . 3 ) Post-Study Assessment : After last session , certify therapist evaluate participant ' affected arm ass ability use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part A : Stroke CP survivor great 18 year age hemiplegia varying level impairment . The subject 's stroke must occur least 3 month prior enrollment study . Healthy person age 18 upper limb impairment . Part B : Low mid function CP stroke survivor great 18 year age hemiplegia . The subject 's stroke must occur least 3 month prior enrollment study . The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) study participant . After administration MoCA , PI research team member use expertise discretion determine whether participant score well enough particular component MOCA particular concern study , e.g . visuospatial acuity concentration . Participants must able sit upright 2 hour time Part A study ; 2 hour time , 3 day week , Part B study . Participants enrol Part B currently receive rehabilitation . Participants receive Botox injection within past 3 month . Participants suffer contracture ( chronic loss joint motion ) debilitate spasticity upper extremity neuromuscular disease . If participant experience great mild pain , and/or PI determine participant longer continue work novel therapy device , study stop .</criteria>
