	<brief_summary>This project part several study explore situation , glucagon potential less glucose elevate effect . Exercise one situation exercise may reduce liver glycogen depot . The investigator aim : 1 . To compare increase plasma glucose 200µg glucagon give either exercise resting 45 minute . 2 . To determine whether subcutaneous glucagon injection exercise great impact hepatic glucose production thereby superior injection exercise prevent hypoglycemia two hour exercise . 3 . To compare accuracy two Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor , ( CGM ) place either abdominal wall upper arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Subcutaneous Glucagon Before , During After Exercise Study Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : A randomized placebo-controlled single-blinded study conduct . The subject know get glucagon placebo investigator know subject get glucagon placebo . Study participant complete three study day serve control . After participant give informed consent , go three step : 1 . Screening day 2 . Run-in period 3 . Three study day random order : - Exercise glucagon inject cycling/or cycling case hypoglycemia - Resting glucagon rest - Exercise glucagon subcutaneous cycle 47-49 hour study visit one CGM device place abdominal wall participant least 7 cm site insulin pump infusion set . One CGM place non-dominant upper arm 10 cm elbow 10 cm shoulder posterior/lateral side arm . The CGMs place seven day . The CGM reading CGM place abdominal wall blind participant . The CGM reading CGM place arm blind participant . In period study visit 4 day study visit participant self-monitoring blood glucose 8 time day standardize time .</detailed_description>
