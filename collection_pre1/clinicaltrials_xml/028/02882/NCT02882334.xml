	<brief_summary>Writer 's cramp ( WC ) focal dystonia characterize abnormal movement posture write . Limited finger independence write manifest difficulty suppress unwanted activation neighbour non task-relevant finger . WC patient also difficulty fine control grip force . However , previous study indicate positive effect individual finger movement train WC although study lack enhanced visual feedback activation 'stationary ' finger . The investigator recently develop Finger Force Manipulandum quantifies force applied finger different task . This method sensitive detection quantification small unwanted contraction non-active ( 'stationary ' ) finger . Forces 'stationary ' finger display on-line providing enhance feedback independence finger movement . The aim study test effectiveness finger individuation train use FFM improve symptom WC patient .</brief_summary>
