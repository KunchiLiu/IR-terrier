	<detailed_description>OPHELIA window-of-opportunity phase II study randomize combination cisplatin olaparib , monotherapy olaparib treatment , standard treatment . Although patient randomize 3 arm , formal comparison 3 arm perform . Patients allocate olaparib monotherapy arm serve proof-of-concept interpret mechanism action olaparib . Patients allocate `` treatment '' group use control . Primary endpoint change tumour Ki67 ( ΔKi67 ) cause investigational treatment . Secondary endpoint early tumour response RECIST criterion , pathologic complete response rate , tolerability treatment surgical complication rate , optionally , metabolic response assess FDG-PET/CT scan . Translational correlate test tumour tissue , plasma germline DNA . All endpoint analyze `` treated analysis '' since trial include formal comparison treatment arm . Administration olaparib monotherapy associate report follow laboratory finding and/or clinical diagnosis , generally mild moderate severity ( CTCAE Grade 1 2 ) generally require treatment discontinuation .</detailed_description>
