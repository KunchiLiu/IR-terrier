	<brief_title>An Interactive Computer Game , Called Duck Duck Punch , Stroke Rehabilitation Home Rehabilitation Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 75 % 800,000 people annually suffer stroke exhibit persistent arm/hand hemiparesis restrict independence thus burden caregiver . Arm motor skill recover rehabilitation program provide adequate `` dose '' repetitive movement practice . However , vast majority stroke survivor lack proper practice-dose duration inpatient stroke rehabilitation limit cost , residence medically underserved rural setting . To meet press need innovative cost-effective rehabilitation option , investigator develop , test licensed prototype virtual environment ( VE ) post-stroke arm rehabilitation . Its custom build design motivates extend practice specific arm motor skill know improve quality life . Excitingly , practice session require direct therapist supervision . Published pilot data demonstrate improved real-world arm movement VE training . These promising initial result lead software upgrade enable installation test primary market technology ; stroke rehabilitation hospital , patient ' home . The overall goal small pilot study test feasibility self-directed VE practice setting measure movement repetition motor skill improvement . To end , project address follow Specific Aims ( 1 ) Determine number daily movement repetition treatment effect achieve inpatient stroke rehabilitation hospital self-direct VE practice session non-therapy hour ( evening , weekend ) compare standard evening activity ; ( 2 ) Determine number daily movement repetition treatment effect achieve in-home stroke survivor self-direct daily VE practice session compare group in-home survivor standard self-directed exercise program .</detailed_description>
