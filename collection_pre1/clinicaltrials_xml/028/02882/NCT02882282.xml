	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) High Risk Oral Intra-Epithelial Neoplasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . If assign Arm A ( control group ) , receive treatment observe . If Arm B , receive pembrolizumab . This call randomization . Both study doctor know group assign . If Arm A , able crossover Arm B study visit end-of-treatment/follow-up visit ( describe ) . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 3 week ( 21 day ) . If Arm B , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycles 1-4 . Study Visits ( Arm B Only ) : On Day 1 Cycles 2-4 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 2 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - During Cycle 2 , 2 oral swab biomarker test . Any blood , tissue , oral swab leave study test ( include follow-up visit describe ) store MD Anderson use future biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers , describe consent form . If anytime study follow-up diagnose oral cancer , previously oral cancer return : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You oral swab biomarker test . Length Study Participation : If Arm B , may receive pembrolizumab 4 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . All participant take part end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 3 month first dose study drug randomization : - You physical exam . - Your tobacco alcohol history collect . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - Oral lesion measure biopsied check status disease . If lesion go away , area lesion locate previously biopsied . - You 2 oral swab collect biomarker test . - If Arm B , urine collect routine test . - If Arm B become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) part urine sample collect pregnancy test . Follow-Up Visits : About 6 , 9 , 18 , 24 , 30 month first dose study drug randomization : - You physical exam . - Your tobacco alcohol history collect . - At 6 month Arm B , blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About 12 36 month first dose study drug randomization : - You physical exam . - Your tobacco alcohol history collect . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You oral swab collect biomarker test . - At 12 month , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - At 12 month , lesion , measure biopsied . If lesion go away , area lesion locate previously biopsied . Long-Term Follow Up : You contact ( either call , mail , e-mailed ) check cancer status . This information may also collect medical record , need . The study doctor tell often may contact . Each phone call last 10 minute . This contact continue unless withdraw study . If contact reason , family member may also contact learn . The study staff ask contact information ( phone number email address ) . If want family member contact , give researcher information . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type melanoma non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . It currently use research purpose head neck cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 250 people enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
