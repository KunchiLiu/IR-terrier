	<brief_summary>Patients genetically diagnose recently report rare Wolfram syndrome type 2 ( WFS2 ) degenerative symptomatic disease include sign diabetes , platelet aggregation defect visual problem ask participate study . Knowing pathomechanism WFS2 rapid cell death , baseline investigation asses severity disease , participant offer chelator therapy addition antioxidant Acetylcystein , diabetic patient Incertin ( GLP-1 ) therapy offer well . The baseline investigation repeat 2 month 5 month therapy order ass progression disease show chelator anti oxidant therapy diabetic patient GLP-1 therapy could stop progression disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Wolfram Syndrome Type 2 With Chelator Deferiprone Incretin Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In WFS2 mutation protein nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 ( NAF-1 ) affect . Given known result NAF-1 protein dysfunction animal culture cell line model namely toxic accumulation iron mitochondrion , lead mitochondrial destruction oxidative stress aim obtain fibroblast sample patient ( use laboratory fibroblast healthy subject control ) These cell culture initially study intracellular iron accumulation re-evaluated follow treatment Deferiprone and/or Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) ex-vivo laboratory . If repeat ( n &gt; =3 ) histological evidence confirm beneficial effect Deferiprone and/or GLP-1 ( incertin base therapy ) patient 's cultured fibroblast reverse toxic iron accumulation patient 's mitochondrion normal level , he/she offer `` vivo '' therapy use oral chelating agent - without dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor GLP-1 receptor agonist . Adding GLP-1 base therapy depend diabetic status patient . Prior follow 60 150 day Chelator and/or GLP-1 therapy go follow clinical laboratory evaluation establish baseline post therapeutic parameter ( outcome ) compare : detailed medical history physical examination complete blood count ( CBC ) iron level platelet aggregation study Fundoscopy visual evoke potential ( VEP ) Hearing evaluation Oral glucose Tolerance Test optional Intra venous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) /glucagon/arginine test HBA1C Daily profile blood glucose Optional CGMS ( continuous glucose monitor system ) Gastroscopy gastric biopsy patient suffers abdominal pain , hematemesis , melena iron deficiency anemia peptic ulcer disease clinically suspect . Based routine use iron chelator , FDA approve , Deferiprone Thalassemia ( detail official guideline Israel association Pediatric Hematology ) similar subcellular iron accumulate disease - e.g . Friedreich Ataxia , initially use dose 20 mg per kilogram body weight ( BW ) daily divide two equal dos . N-Acetylcystein counter drug also anti-oxidant give orally dose 200mg twice daily synergistic effect Deferiprone . In addition suffer diabetes receive Januet ( Sitagliptin/metformin ) .</detailed_description>
