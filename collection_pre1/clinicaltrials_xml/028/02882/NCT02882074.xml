	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether patient receive human albumin plasma volume replacement cardiac surgery improve postoperative endothelial function compare patient receive 6 % hydroxyethyl starch solution . The postoperative endothelial function , measure peripheral arterial tonometry reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) within 2 hour follow surgery , compare cardiac surgical patient randomize receive human albumin 6 % HES solution intraoperative volume replacement . Within two hour arrival ICU peripheral arterial tonometry use EndoPAT perform . In subset 40 consecutive patient investigator perform additional EndoPAT measurement describe expect change occur endothelial function perioperative period ( baseline , early postoperative 24 hour postoperative ) use RHI . This study also determine whether human albumin 5 % reduces plasma biomarkers endothelial glycocalyceal damage measure plasma concentration syndecan 1 endocan baseline ( surgery ) , 1 24 hour follow surgery . Blood sample take morning surgery , within one hour arrival intensive care unit ( ICU ) , 24 hour surgery within 2 hour discharge ICU ( three time altogether ) . These sample use measure plasma concentration two biomarkers measure endothelial injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgical patient enrol SHARP study randomize 5 % human albumin 6 % HES entrance operating room . Anesthetic Surgical management follow protocol establish SHARP study include administration blind study solution contain 5 % human albumin 6 % HES follow separation cardiopulmonary bypass . Blood collect measurement baseline syndecan 1 endocan follow arterial line urinary catheter placement surgical incision . At 1 24 hr follow surgery completion , blood collect measurement syndecan 1 endocan . Within two hour ICU arrival , assessment endothelial function perform . In subset patient ( patient consent multiple measurement ) , assessment endothelial function perform preoperatively ( baseline ) 24 hour surgery . Vasoactive substance may influence EndoPAT measurement . Thus investigator collect data use preoperative antihypertensive medication direct indirect effect arterial smooth muscle relaxation . Use epinephrine , norepinephrine , vasopressin , milrinone , nitroglycerine , nitroprusside , sedative propofol , dexmedetomidine others record adjusted analysis . Data pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) blood component transfusion collect Anesthesia Record Keeping System . Indications PRBC transfusion include hematocrit ( HCT ) &lt; 22 % cardiopulmonary bypass &lt; 24 % cardiopulmonary bypass , hypovolemia anemia ( HCT &lt; 25 % mean arterial blood pressure &lt; 60 mmHg heart rate &gt; 100 bpm ) . Blood component transfusion ( platelet , fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate ) may administer necessary follow institutional standard care . Imbalances blood product transfusion study group adjust analysis .</detailed_description>
