	<brief_title>Study IACS-010759 Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 6 group 3-6 participant enrol dose escalation part study . Up 18 participant enrol dose expansion . If enrol dose escalation , dose IACS-010759 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level IACS-010759 . Each new group receive high dose IACS-010759 group , intolerable side effect see . A new group high dose level may start time ongoing group receive low dose . If happens , participant assign alternate manner low dose high dose group . This continue high tolerable dose IACS-010759 found . If enrol dose expansion part study , receive dose level IACS-010759 find best dose escalation part study . In dose expansion part study , 6 participant also enrol food-effect group ( describe detail ) help researcher understand effect take study drug food . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . Cycle 1 28 day . You take IACS-010759 mouth one ( 1 ) time every day . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , take first dose IACS-010759 wait 7 day take next dose . Starting Day 8 Cycle 1 , take study drug every day next 21 day . You take dose glass water least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If miss dose , take another dose next scheduled time . If enrol food-effect group , take first dose IACS-010759 within 30 minute eat high fat meal . You admitted hospital Day 1 Cycle 1 24 hour Day 8 Cycle 1 7 day . This do checked side effect . Length Study : You may continue take IACS-010759 12 cycle . If doctor think best interest , may able continue receive study drug beyond 12 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study long-term follow-up ( describe ) . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 , 14 , 28 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 8-9 teaspoon time ) drawn dose test routine , acid/base level , PD test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test dose 5 time next 12 hour dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG - On Day 28 , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease create lab test learn well drug work . On Days 2 4 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine , acid/base level PK test . On Days 9 , 10 , 12 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) urine collect routine test dose . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn dose 6 hour dose PK testing . - On Day 10 , blood ( 6 teaspoon time ) drawn dose 6 hour dose PD testing . - On Day 10 , physical exam . On Days 17 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) drawn check well pancreas function routine acid/base level test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test dose 6 hour dose . - Urine collect routine test . - On Day 22 , blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw PD test . - On Day 22 , EKG . On Days 1 21 Cycles 2 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine , acid/base level , PK test . °During Cycle 2 , blood draw also use check well pancreas function . - Urine collect routine test . - On Day 21 Cycle 3 , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy . On Days 8 14 Cycle 2 : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine acid/base level PK testing . This blood draw also use check well pancreas function . - Urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 4 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) drawn check well pancreas function routine acid/base level test . - Urine collect routine test . Every 2-3 cycle study , doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy . If study doctor increase dose study drug , follow perform weekly first cycle high dose : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine acid/base level PK testing . This blood draw also use check well pancreas function . - Urine collect routine test . If study doctor stop re-starts dose study drug , follow perform : - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw acid/base level test check well pancreas function . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test dose 6 hour dose . If study doctor lower dose study drug , follow performed start take low dose : °Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test dose 6 time next 72 hour dose . End-of-Study Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy . If unable return clinic visit , test perform local doctor result send study doctor . The research nurse call ask health . These call last 5 minute . Long-Term Follow-up : If disease appear respond study drug , member study staff call every 3-6 month 5 year ask side effect may . Each call last 5 minute . If doctor think need , may ask come clinic physical exam . This investigational study . IACS-010759 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 48 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
