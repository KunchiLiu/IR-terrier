	<brief_title>Formal Consensus Method Evaluate Conformity Prescription Recently Approved Chemotherapy Treatment Observatory Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patient , treatment usually consist first line chemotherapy docetaxel follow second line treatment either second generation hormonal therapy ( abiraterone acetate enzalutamide ) new taxane derivative cabazitaxel . Cabazitaxel ( Jevtana ) semi-synthetic taxane mechanism action different docetaxel paclitaxel . It antineoplastic agent stabilises microtubules network via binding tubulins inhibition microtubules disassembly . Cabazitaxel demonstrate broad spectrum antitumour activity advance human tumour xenografted mice . It active docetaxel-sensitive tumour tumour model resistant chemotherapy , include docetaxel . The efficacy cabazitaxel demonstrate pivotal clinical trial TROPIC , randomize , open-label , phase III study compare cabazitaxel ( n = 378 ) mitoxantrone ( n = 377 ) , associate prednisone prednisolone patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treat docetaxel contain regimen . The median overall survival ( OS ) significantly increase cabazitaxel-treated group compare mitoxantrone-treated group . Most common adverse event lead treatment discontinuation haematological ( neutropenia 82 % ) , gastrointestinal ( diarrhoea 6 % ) general disorder ( asthenia 5 % ) . A recent study analyse data TROPIC study efficacy toxicity observe subgroup patient include French centre . These result comparable report overall population safety profile remain favourable without toxic death relate cabazitaxel . Following TROPIC trial , cabazitaxel ( combination prednisone prednisolone ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) June 2010 European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) March 2011 treatment hormone-refractory prostate cancer . In France cabazitaxel approve 2012 make available 2014 . To investigate whether precaution use cabazitaxel ( contraindication , hepatic function , premedication hypersensitivity , prophylactic treatment , dose dose adjustment , well condition administration ) respect routine practice , observational cohort study implement 32 oncology centre South-West region France ( CABOBS study ) . The primary objective cohort evaluate conformity cabazitaxel prescription Summary Product Characteristics ( SPC ) clinical practice ( indication monitor method ) accord condition use . Based SPC , Specifications prescription include 26 item divide `` baseline '' ( 14 ) criterion `` cycle 2 '' ( 12 ) criterion , include requirement second following cycle . Because high number specific item , strict adherence prescription indication might unsatisfactory appropriate clinical point view , criterion different relevance appropriateness prescription ; therefore , necessary select criterion base relevance accord opinion clinical expert . For purpose , two independent panel expert field uro-oncology , one French panel European panel EORTC , solicit order define importance criterion SPC allow qualitative assessment conformity use formal consensus method . Consensus method provide mean synthesise information compare contradictory opinion evidence specific issue . Their purpose assess extent agreement resolve disagreement among group select individual identify selecting , iterative rating feedback , specific point disagreement uncertainty . The Delphi method , consensus method originated 1948 , attempt obtain expert opinion systematic manner . The survey conduct `` round '' questionnaire administer expert individually anonymously . After round , result list reported group . A Delphi consider complete convergence opinion . In modified Delphi usually predefined number round final round , expert meet resolve summarise result consensus , hold . The Sponsor rely Delphi method suit area limited number evidence available enable recommendation guideline draw . Moreover , evaluate item come official document provide EMA , SPC cabazitaxel . Thus , expect expert select relevant item . In frame CABOBS study , method allow select 26 item SPC list accord importance , define primary objective conformity cabazitaxel condition use .</detailed_description>
