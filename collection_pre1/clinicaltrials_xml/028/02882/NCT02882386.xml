	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate amino acid kinetics blood bout strength training ingestion different milk protein supplement ( native whey , whey protein concentrate 80 , hydrolyse whey , microparticulated whey milk ) The investigator hypothesize native whey give faster high rise blood concentration leucine compare milk protein supplement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increasing maintain muscle mass great importance population range athlete patient elderly . Resistance exercise protein ingestion two potent stimulators muscle protein synthesis . Both physical characteristic protein ( e.g . different digestion rate whey casein ) amino acid composition , affect potential certain protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Given superior ability rapidly increase blood leucine concentration high level , whey often consider potent protein source stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Native whey protein produce filtration unprocessed milk . Consequently , native whey different characteristic WPC-80 , expose heat acidification . Because direct filtration unprocessed milk , native whey intact protein compare WPC-80 . Of special interest high amount leucine native whey . The aim double-blinded randomize 5-arm cross-over study compare amino acid kinetics blood bout strength training ingestion 20 gram high quality , distinct , dairy protein supplement ( native whey , whey protein concentrate 80 , hydrolyse whey , microparticulated whey milk ) . Furthermore , investigator investigate whether difference amino acid kinetics affect acute blood glucose urea response , well recovery muscle function bout strength training . The investigator hypothesize native whey give faster high rise blood concentration leucine compare protein supplement .</detailed_description>
