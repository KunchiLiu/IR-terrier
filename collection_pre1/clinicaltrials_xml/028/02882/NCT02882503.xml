	<brief_summary>Incidental pancreatic solid cystic lesion diagnose increased frequency due widespread use abdominal cross-sectional imaging investigate unrelated symptom . Lesions neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) , mucinous cystadenomas intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) potential malignant transformation . The standard treatment solid cystic pancreatic lesion malignant potential surgical resection , lesion pancreatic head require Whipple resection whereas pancreatic tail lesion treat distal pancreatectomy . Both type resection carry significant morbidity mortality . The study would like outline feasibility , safety , adverse event early result endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) - radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) pancreatic neoplasm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Radiofrequency Ablation ( EUS-RFA ) Small Benign Pancreatic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention describe radiofrequency ablation apply innovative monopolar radiofrequency probe ( 1.2 mm Habib EUS-RFA catheter ) place 19 22 gauge fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) needle FNA perform patient tumor head pancreas . The device certificate European Union ( EU ) receive Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval 2015 . The endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) - radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) 1 Fr wire work length 190 cm , insert biopsy channel EUS . RF power apply electrode end wire coagulate tissue liver pancreas . In study , investigator enroll 20 patient receive EUS-RFA pancreatic neoplasm monopolar RF probe . The follow-up period one year regular monitoring . Our primary endpoint evaluate pancreatic tumor ablation effect , Secondary objectives evaluate mortality morbidity .</detailed_description>
