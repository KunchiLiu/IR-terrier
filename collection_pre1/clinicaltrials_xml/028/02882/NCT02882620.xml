	<detailed_description>Despite effectiveness CRC screening test average risk adult , test under-utilized AI/ANs . A recent study AI/ANs utilize IHS facility report 4.0 % average risk AI/ANs age 50-75 , compare nearly 65 % U.S. adult , current CRC screening guideline . The overall objective test efficacy serially implemented intervention grade intensity design enhance annual CRC screen use FIT AI community . The aim : Aim 1 . Finalize evaluate efficacy serially implemented intervention grade intensity increase annual CRC screen uptake . Aim 2 . Determine promoter barrier enhance annual CRC screening practice . Aim 3 . Conduct process evaluation study : cost-effectiveness intervention , implementation fidelity , sustainability scalability . Protocol A . Aim 1—Qualitative Research ( Intervention Finalization ) 1 . Research Design : Qualitative design , use focus group methodology . 2 . Study Population : Recruited project 's Community Advisory Council , Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center 's ( AASTEC 's ) Executive Council , Community Health Representatives , tribal stakeholder . 3 . Recruitment Target : Up 30-36 eligible ( assume attrition ) person . 4 . Recruitment Methods : Purposive sampling method . 5 . Procedures : Conduct three focus group , group consist 6 8 participant . Each session meet approximately two hour . Before start discussion , participant provide informed consent complete survey collect socio-demographic information . The purpose focus group finalize intervention 's educational material , ensure culturally appropriate contains message operationalizing various construct theory guide study ( Health behavior Framework ; HBF ) . B . Aim 1—Quantitative Research ( Efficacy RCT ) 1 . Research Design : Randomly assign , three-group , pretest-posttest design . 2 . Research Setting : Six Pueblo Tribes New Mexico . 3 . Randomization : Using simple random allocation procedure . 4 . Participants Identification Sampling : Identify eligible participant IHS Resource Patient Management System ( RPMS ) electronic health record system . We invite eligible person ( estimate 1,700 ) identify RPMS participate . 5 . Interventions : The intervention grade intensity : high intensity , medium intensity , reference group ( usual care ) . 6 . Procedures : After randomize tribes three Groups , mail recruitment letter , consent form completion survey , baseline survey . We mail first posttest survey 12 month mail baseline survey , 2nd 3rd posttest survey mail successive 12-month interval . Between baseline 1st posttest survey , participant receive group-specific intervention . All eligible adult include analysis primary outcome ( ie , completion FIT kit ) since non-completion FIT valid response . All eligible participant Groups 1 2 receive mail FIT kit whether return baseline survey . 7 . Implementation Intervention : We simultaneously implement intervention , three 12-month cycle . For Groups 1 2 , mail FIT kit , educational material one month follow initial recruitment letter/baseline survey mailing . For Group 1 , navigator offer four education outreach session . Group 2 receive FIT education material mailing . Group 3 receive usual care ( screen recommendation FIT kit clinic visit ) . 8 . Baseline Posttest Surveys : These survey collect data CRC-related knowledge , attitude , perceive control , perceive susceptibility severity , social support , self-efficacy . The baseline survey also collect socio-demographic data . 9 . Data Management Analysis : We summarize categorical continuous variable use descriptive statistic . For analysis , overall type I error rate α=0.05 . We use appropriate method Tukey 's honest significant difference test Bonferroni correction multiple comparison . For primary outcome , annual completion FIT kit , primary endpoint proportion participant within Group complete return 0 , 1 , 2 3 FIT kit . All analyse intent-to-treat , since eligible participant include analysis . We compare primary outcome across intervention via likelihood ratio test multiple comparison adjustment . To summarize intervention effect , report odds ratios 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) complete 3 FIT kit compare return 2 , 1 , FIT kit . The secondary outcome temporal change HBF construct ( eg , knowledge , attitude , perceive risk ) baseline 12-month cycle follow baseline survey . We assess temporal change HBF construct repeat measure linear regression model understand intervention ' effect time . Predictive value intervention HBF construct yearly FIT uptake assess refit repeat measure logistic regression model describe primary analysis dependent variable return complete FIT kit ( yes vs. ) time point , also include covariate score return survey measure HBF construct . We report odds ratio ( 95 % CIs ) completion Groups . 10 . Sample Size Considerations : We power study measure significant change Group annual completion FIT ( primary outcome ) . With hypothesized proportion participant 0 , 1 , 2 3 returned FIT kit reflect average 4 % , 14 % 24 % completing FIT year three Groups , respectively , power study ~99 % 566 participant per Group ( total=1,698 ) . We adjust multiple comparison power calculation use Bonferroni correction . Aim 2—Qualitative Research ( Understanding Behavior Change Context ) 1 . Research Design : Qualitative design . 2 . Study Population : Participants `` largely adherent '' ( complete FIT 2 3 3 time ) `` adherent '' ( complete FIT 0 1 3 time ) guideline ; navigator ; provider medical director IHS facility . 3 . Recruitment Target : Up 120-144 participant ( assume attrition ) take part Aim 1 Efficacy RCT ; 60 participant `` largely adherent '' 60 participant `` adherent '' FIT guideline . All navigator ( n=3 ) work project medical director ( n=3 ) three participate IHS facility . One health care provider three participate IHS facility ( n=3 ) . 4 . Recruitment Methods : Purposive sampling method . 5 . Procedures : Conduct 12 focus group , group consist 6 8 participant . Each session meet approximately two hour . Before start discussion , participant provide informed consent . The moderator explore HBF factor conducive `` largely adherent '' screen guideline . Among participant `` adherent '' CRC screen guideline , inquire barrier complete FIT potential solution . We also inquire sustain scale-up intervention broad dissemination . Conduct interview navigator , health care provider medical director IHS facility . Before start interview , obtain informed consent . Interviews navigator focus delivery intervention , barrier promoter provide navigation , participant ' reason `` largely adhere '' `` adhere '' CRC screen guideline , strategy sustain scale-up intervention . Interviews health care provider medical director focus systems-level factor may may facilitate delivery CRC screening service , viability use navigation cancer screen community setting , strategy sustain scale-up intervention . We collect baseline socio-demographic information participant . Aim 3—Process Evaluation Studies ( Cost-Effectiveness Analysis , Implementation Fidelity , Sustainability Scalability ) 1 . Procedure—Cost-Effectiveness Analysis : We collect use primary secondary data define parameter Markov model cost-effectiveness . We include data CRC epidemiology New Mexico , screen treatment cost , screen compliance rate cycle serially implemented intervention . We collect data cost include navigation , mail FITs , educational material , follow-up cost Group . We assess direct medical cost IHS RPMS , contain patient encounter-level data outpatient ICD-9 diagnosis procedure code . We extract data sensitivity , specificity efficacy screen test peer-reviewed literature . We begin construct decision tree Groups . We compute cost decision node ( FIT completed/FIT complete receive colonoscopy/did receive colonoscopy ) base directly accrue medical non-medical cost obtain data source identify . The result cost-effectiveness analysis incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) three Groups . 2 . Procedure—Implementation Fidelity : We evaluate fidelity implementation base standard component , include : reach potentially eligible participant ; recruitment ; resource expertise need research ; broader content ( ie , social , physical , cultural , structural factor ) ; fidelity delivery intervention ; amount intervention actually deliver ; amount intervention actually receive ; challenge encounter implementing research ; potential contamination ; number quality partnership . 3 . Procedure—Sustainability Scalability : We operationalize concept sustain scaling-up efficacious intervention , include : nature intervention ; intervention ' efficacy ; cost cost-effectiveness intervention ; partnership ; organizational capacity ; contextual factor ; promoter barrier ; generalizability population .</detailed_description>
