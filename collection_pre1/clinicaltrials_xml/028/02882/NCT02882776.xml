	<detailed_description>Herbal medicine product dietary supplement people take improve health . Many herb use long time claim health benefit . They sell tablet , capsule , powder , beverage , extract fresh dry plant . Herbal medicine associate treatment several physiological disorder hematological , mainly clot disorder . Those include garlic , onion , ginger addition pharmacological reagent aspirin , warfarin , heparin , others . One herbal medication affect hematological profile ginger gain focus throughout study conduct previous year field inhibit platelet aggregation , take benefit undesirable side effect arise use anti-platelet aggregation agent , especially aspirin . Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) well know spice flavor agent use traditional medicine many country . It source valuable phytonutrients characterize aromatic odor pungent taste . The ginger rhizome contain 60 % starch , 10 % protein , 10 % fat , 5 % fiber , 6 % inorganic material , 10 % residual moisture , 1-4 % essential oil include gingerol zingiberene , addition pungent principle zingerone , gingerol shogaol . Shogaols produce heating gingerol . It speculate ginger eliminate symptom associate variety illness since variety chemical class compound belong . Ginger use management headache , nervous disease , nausea , vomit . It also use treat migraine headache without side-effects . In addition , recommend management rheumatic disorder muscular pain . Ginger also act metabolic enhancer acetone extract ginger stimulate bile secretion excretion gallstone . Although ginger consider safe herbal medicine insignificant adverse side effect , undesirable effect like heartburn notice . In quantity higher 6 g ginger may act gastric irritant inhalation dust ginger may produce immunoglobulin E ( IGE ) -mediated allergy . As ginger toxicity , acute overdose ginger usually excess 2g ginger per kilogram body mass depend ginger tolerance level result state central nervous system over-stimulation call `` ginger gitters '' . Experimental data reveals ginger may dual inhibitor eicosanoid synthesis , inhibit synthesis prostaglandin leukotrienes , inflammatory mediator produce arachidonic acid . With reference fact normal platelet functioning link interplay substance , ginger consumption appear link reduce platelet aggregation . Platelets traditionally link concept hemostasis hemorrhagic disorder . However , increase incidence atherosclerosis hematologic disorder , critical role play platelet evident . Platelets longer view `` scaffold '' event coagulation cascade rather important catalyst hemostasis , thrombosis , fibrinolysis . Improved understanding platelet physiology lead development pharmacologic adjunct result improved patency rate improve patient outcome . Platelets small component blood stream , exist a-nucleate disc-shaped cell rest state travel singly discoidal particle . In presence stimulus arachidonic acid , activated platelet change shape spiny sphere . They bind fibrinogen , aggregate release content intracellular granule , include adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) serotonin . ADP arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolite act endogenous platelet activator , thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) , intensify extent platelet aggregation . ADP , arachidonic acid , epinephrine , collagen act agonists platelet aggregation clump . These substance act positive feedback loop , make platelet aggregation autocatalytic rather equilibrium response . Under pathophysiological condition , platelet activation may result peripheral , cardiovascular cerebrovascular thrombosis serious consequence . Aspirin main anti-platelet therapeutic agent . Inhibition platelet aggregation aspirin significantly reduces incidence first myocardial infarction , recurrent infarction vascular death among patient cardiovascular disease . Aspirin also reduce risk nonfatal stroke , nonfatal myocardial infarction vascular death patient possible risk factor . However , aspirin ingestion , mainly associate gastric ulcer gastrointestinal bleeding . Thus , use aspirin may confine elderly patient whose benefit outweigh increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding . Gingerols derivative , especially [ 8 ] -paradol , report potent anti-platelet cyclo-oxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) inhibitor aspirin , test vitro Chrono Log whole blood platelet aggregometer . Note COX-1 enzyme responsible conversion arachidonic acid important biological mediator include prostaglandin , prostacyclins , thromboxanes . These author propose carbonyl functional group C3 find paradol diarylheptanoid series may contribute potent anti-platelet activity inhibition COX-1 . Inhibition arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolism cascade via COX-1/thromboxane synthase system phenolic compound may underline mechanism action . In 2001 Koo et al . compare ability gingerol related analog aspirin inhibit AA-induced human platelet serotonin release vitro . Using dose range , find gingerol related analog approximately two- three-fold less potent aspirin platelet release reaction initiate AA , two- four-fold less potent aspirin inhibit AA-induced platelet aggregation . Gingerols inhibit COX activity , assess measure prostaglandin D2 , product AA metabolism COX . These result suggest inhibition COX activity gingerol related analog may underlie mechanism effect AA-induced platelet activation . 6-gingerol inhibits arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation formation thromboxane B2 prostaglandin D2 . Gingerol , shogaol structurally related substance ginger inhibit prostaglandin leukotriene biosynthesis . Of early study conduct ginger Srivastava et al . 1986 find 5g fresh , raw ginger inhibit thromboxane B2 formation . Furthermore , study do 20 healthy male individual give 50 g butter 5g ginger day seven day show addition ginger fatty meal inhibit platelet aggregation induce adenosine diphosphate epinephrine greatly . Ginger report inhibit prostaglandin synthesis vitro . Dietary fat content affect platelet aggregation modify prostaglandin metabolism . Administration ginger fatty diet inhibits transformation arachidonic acid thromboxane decrease sensitivity platelet many aggregate agent . In 1994 , Lumb et al. , show cross study conduct 8 subject 2g powdered ginger ( prepared medication ) effect bleed time whole blood platelet aggregation . Similarly , 15g 40g fresh cook raw ginger induce platelet aggregation cross study conduct Janssen et al . 1996 . Moreover , 1997 , Boardia et al . find 4g ginger powder ineffective , 10g reduce platelet aggregation . Tested via addition platelet aggregation agonists collagen , ADP , epinephrine , platelet aggregation inhibit 35.3 % , 37.8 % , 35.9 % respectively upon administration 1g dry ginger week . A combination 1 g ginger 10 mg nifedipine per day could valuable cardiovascular cerebrovascular complication due platelet aggregation . Therefore , study conduct study effect ginger bleeding risk find effect 15g raw ginger , 40g cook ginger , 4g dry ginger daily platelet aggregation whereas 10g dried ginger decrease platelet aggregation . Throughout previous year , several study design study effect different dos different ginger form ( fresh , dry , extract , capsule ) platelet aggregation profile . Although make suspect true , still others possess controversial result . In view literature offer , probable ginger anti-platelet effect could dose dependent , form dependent , probably population individual dependent postulate Helgason et al . 1993 analysis aspirin warfarin platelet aggregation effect . Previous study might also employ old , non-reliable technique study platelet aggregation profile . As Saudi population , consumption powder ginger dissolve hot water common practice . Accordingly , study , tempt speculate effect form ginger consumption , give separate time point per day , platelet aggregation profile use platelet aggregation analogue . If positive result obtain , herb could provide natural protection development platelet aggregation complication could potential alternative aspirin , use improve blood circulation hematological pathophysiologies diseased individual .</detailed_description>
