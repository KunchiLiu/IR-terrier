	<brief_title>MOlecular BIomarkers Adherent Invasive Escherichia Coli ( AIEC ) Detection Study In Crohn 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>350 Crohn 's disease patient include study , target 300 evaluable patient . An interim analysis perform 50 % evaluable patient recruit . The primary objective evaluate relation non-invasive biomarkers ( host immunological variable metagenomic analysis stool ) AIEC detection biopsy take endoscopy , order develop predictive algorithm AIEC carriage . The secondary objective : - Validation AIEC detection algorithm use qPCR technology . - Assessment correlation presence AIEC endoscopic clinical evaluation disease ( CDEIS , SES-CD , Harvey-Bradshaw Index Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ) . - Development validation non-invasive qPCR base diagnostic Mucosal Healing CD patient . - Collection biological sample associate clinical biological data CD patient .</detailed_description>
