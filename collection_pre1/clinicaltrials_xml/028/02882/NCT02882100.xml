	<detailed_description>SUMMARY : A random study sample 1000 NHs within 75 mile local area 121 city CDC performs weekly influenza surveillance ( estimate N= 11,239 ) may offer opportunity participation ; first 1000 eligible participate accept offer enrol . Participating facility offer vaccine education resident staff , randomly allocate receive aTIV ( FLUAD ) vaccine usual care ( TIV ) vaccination resident . BACKGROUND : Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRI ) , include pneumonia , bronchitis , tracheobronchitis , lead cause infectious mortality hospitalization old adult , nursing home ( NH ) resident . Pneumonia infection often produce attenuated sign symptom old adult , lead delay even misdiagnosis population . Diagnosis compromise due sporadic clinician visit nurse home resident , reduce access radiology . LRI may may directly lead hospitalization , LRIs associate considerable morbidity result hospitalization , include exacerbation underlie cardiopulmonary disease . Hospitalization rate NH resident vary considerably facility , majority hospitalization occur 12 week influenza peaks year . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective estimate difference hospitalization rate influenza season experience long-stay nursing home resident , facility use adjuvanted trivalent vaccine vs. standard trivalent vaccine . The secondary objective estimate difference likelihood Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) functional decline mortality rate study nursing home , influenza outbreak .</detailed_description>
