	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) condition result environmentally induce lung damage e.g . cigarette smoke air pollution , time , cause individual suffer symptom include chronic cough progressive breathlessness . In UK COPD predominantly cause cigarette smoking may occur decade symptom appear disease diagnose . The aim study identify COPD patient currently milder disease investigate whether detailed , medical assessment time ass aspect care improve lung health general wellbeing . COPD major cause disability death UK , around 835,000 people currently diagnose disease estimate two million people suffer symptoms yet diagnosis ( 1 ) . Approximately 25,000 people year die COPD England Wales ( 2 ) , disease account 5.4 % death England Wales 2013 ( 3 ) . Predominantly later , severe stage , COPD cause enormous symptom burden patient , account half emergency admission already overstretch hospital service England ( 4 ) . People COPD , past history smoking , high risk medical problem heart disease stroke ( 5 ) . Being breathless multiple physical health problem also lead mental health problem anxiety depression ( 5 ) . This mean challenging provide group people enough time fully assess treat problem , particularly due current pressure length GP appointment time . Whilst COPD treatable , curable , emphasis early diagnosis intervention provide key part strategy COPD publish NHS England 2012 ( 6 ) . With early diagnosis , opportunity provide intervene aim improve symptom exercise tolerance , reduce risk exacerbation , slow deterioration prolong quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1.1 : History Burden COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) believe first describe Theophile Bonnet 1679 form cadaveric 'voluminous lung ' ( 7 ) . Despite major cause disability death UK ( 1 ) , COPD still remain relatively poor relation many current lead cause death term health resource allocation , patient public understanding interest motivation health professional diagnose manage disease ( 8 ) . Over last three hundred year , COPD know health professional public variety guise include emphysema , chronic bronchitis , smoker 's cough chronic airflow obstruction . The term , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease believe use first time 1965 William Briscoe 9th Aspen Emphysema Conference ( 7 ) . Although name successfully unify , negative association , variable diagnosis rate management strategy amongst patient disease continue . Sadly , nihilistic attitude towards value diagnosis treatment disease still find clinician , feel value accurate early diagnosis small evidence disease course alter intervention ( 8 ) . Whilst lack disease-modifying intervention smoke cessation , effective pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention show improve disease symptom ( 4 ) . Accurate , early diagnosis disease education first step achieve high quality care throughout whole patient journey include palliative care . COPD patient may perceive either slow emphysematous downward decline , spiral rapidly cycle recurrent exacerbation hospital admission lung function decline death ( 8-10 ) . However , range effective intervention available ( include pharmacological strategy , patient education , diet exercise strategy , vaccination target smoke cessation intervention ) early diagnosis ongoing proactive care 'gold standard ' ( 4 ) . The relatively recent evidence support pulmonary rehabilitation ( 11 ) , lung volume reduction technique ( 12 ) , modern development pharmacotherapy preventative care provide health care professional access therapy prove benefit term morbidity . The wealth inhale therapy flood market enormous cost burden COPD NHS lead interest research disease last decade . This research generate increase understanding disease pathology , recognition multiple disease phenotype grow acknowledgement need direct therapy individual rather disease population whole . Increasing bed pressure NHS shift focus towards identification high-risk patient recurrent hospital attendee , resource direct towards strategy reduce hospitalisation towards community base care . Currently , service vary enormously hospital trust commission group , range Community Matron support , hospital admission avoidance early discharge scheme , full time , multidisciplinary , integrated COPD team attempt bridge gap service provision communication Primary Secondary Care ( 4 ) . 1.2 : Risk Stratification within COPD In last ten year , much research direct towards risk stratification within COPD , whereas previous risk stratification centre lung function , i.e . FEV1 , recognise disease far complex ( 4 ) . A variety factor symptom burden , historic exacerbation rate , exercise tolerance , smoke status co-morbidities show significant marker health status risk COPD ( 4 , 13-15 ) , may useful predict deterioration , consequent health social care utilisation . Thus far , attention mainly focus highlight factor indicate deterioration end stage disease aim identify efficiently deploy health service manage patient high symptom burden high level health care utilisation . Whilst remain important point research limit achieve , relatively late point disease process , management direct achieve effectively , high quality , multi-disciplinary , palliative care . We hypothesise make big difference patient health service long term , attention need focus earlier stage COPD bulk irreversible lung damage already occur . 1.3 : The DOSE score A variety score system exist try risk stratify COPD . The DOSE score ( Dyspnoea Obstruction , Smoking Exacerbation ) index severity COPD develop Jones et al 2009 audit data set patient Devon UK ( 16 ) . The DOSE Index point associate category four variable ( mMRC Dyspnoea Scale Score , FEV1 % predict , smoke status , exacerbation per year ) add build DOSE Index score . It derive multiple regression analyse possible marker health status COPD relationship quality life score . A scoring system develop accord clinical statistical strength validate three data set London , Holland Japan . It correlate well COPD severity score system BODE ( Body mass index , degree airflow Obstruction , Dyspnoea Exercise capacity ) index ( 17 ) ADO ( Age , Dyspnoea , airflow Obstruction ) score , carry advantage use modifiable variable available exist Primary Care datasets . Jones et al demonstrate 'high ' score ( &gt; 4 ) show great risk hospital admission , increase hospital bed day risk respiratory failure ( 16 ) . A high DOSE score since demonstrate predict increase five year respiratory mortality 42.4 % vs 11.0 % low score ( 18 ) predict increase respiratory symptom burden subsequent two year score ( 19 ) . A high score also show predict increase risk subsequent exacerbation frequency , hypercapnoea poorer exercise capacity ( 20 ) . In patient aim optimise symptom risk provide high quality palliative care , may span many year . Despite , demonstrate Sundh et al , still mortality 40 % five year high DOSE score group ( 18 ) , associate considerable symptom care burden . Evidence exist support poorer outcome COPD patient certain co-morbidities , particularly related heart disease , osteoporosis , Body Mass Index mental health ( 14 ) . COPD prevalence also strongly relate socioeconomic status . Other parameter live alone , presence respiratory co-morbidities , persistent inflammatory state reflect raised inflammatory marker , presence dementia gastro-oesophageal reflux disease seem likely associate poor outcome less data conflict data associate link COPD ( 20 ) . The original paper Jones et al noted mean increase DOSE score 0.18 DOSE points/year nine year London cohort ( 16 ) one would expect considerable variation patient rate decline . The group currently undertake 'CASCADE ' , five year , retrospective , database search anonymised primary care record ( The Hampshire Health Record ) , DOSE score recalculate five year increase score used surrogate marker health status deterioration . In identified baseline low DOSE score ( &lt; 4 ) , subsequent rate change DOSE score use hospital emergency service use divide cohort 'high risk ' 'low risk ' group . 'CASCADE ' also identifies , baseline , co-morbid social demographic mention paragraph patient . Using regression analysis , hope identify co-morbid social demographic risk-stratify patient baseline , ultimately create model , applicable Primary Care . In CASCADE II collect data regard co-morbidities social demographic real world COPD population . As one secondary analysis provide u pilot data develop risk prediction model real world clinical setting . Evidence treatment affect disease progression rate COPD scarce ( exception smoke cessation ) perhaps partly often complex patient group clinically socially highlight late disease process . Within CASCADE II study aim go way remedy deficit explore potential relationship intervention already recommend ( e.g . formal diagnosis use spirometry , optimal inhaler prescription , participation pulmonary rehabilitation optimisation comorbidities ) respiratory health status adequate time expertise prospectively allocate recognise optimise aspects patient ' health . 2 . Hypothesis We hypothesise complex intervention optimise clinical supportive care early stage COPD patient improve health outcome cost effective . 3 . Study Aim Within population COPD patient deem 'low risk ' DOSE score respiratory symptom , study look establish whether intervention form prospective , depth , medical assessment individualise optimisation care alter respiratory health status clinical outcome twelve month comparison standard care . 4 . Study Design A cluster randomise control interventional study impact health status prospective assessment individualise medical optimisation use GP practice cluster cohort base analysis .</detailed_description>
