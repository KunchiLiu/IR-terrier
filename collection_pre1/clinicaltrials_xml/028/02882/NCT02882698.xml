	<detailed_description>The game Marble Maze Classic® use , participant move mobile phone conduct virtual marble maze design . The investigator evaluate 100 individual ( 50 Down Syndrome-DS 50 typical development-TD ) divide DS TD group 1 2 , group consist 25 participant , group 2 use maze design totally opposite group 1 . Participants SD TD divide two subgroup : Group 1 ( n = 50 , consist 25 participant TD 25 participant SD ) Group 2 ( n = 50 , consist 25 participant TD 25 participant SD ) , design maze group 2 totally opposite group 1 stage experiment . The use opposite maze necessary verify sequence movement maze path influence performance . To maintain characteristic random sampling , participant equal chance participate group , The investigator use simple probabilistic random sampling , conduct draw paper . PROCEDURES Individuals position comfortably chair set accord size necessary , well footrest , stay properly position enable execution task . Before start task , function game verbally explain , along demonstration make examiner . The examiner state goal game get marble end maze short possible time movement , sideways ( supination pronation forearm , flexion extension wrist finger ) . Participants perform attempt dominant hand ( except intermanual transfer phase ) task repeat several time accord design experiment . In experiment phase ( acquisition , retention transfer ) execution time note entire path beginning maze end point , phase path perform specific amount repetition . To try match difficulty task , mazes customized path require eight basic movement virtual marble reach target , two movement forearm pronation , two supination , two wrist flexion two extension . In design learning protocol , participant perform 30 repetition maze task acquisition phase dominant hand , group maze . After 30 repetition , 5-minute rest period participant contact task . Then , 5 repetition perform retention phase maze acquisition . For transfer phase , participant perform 15 repetition divide 3 block 5 attempt use different maze design : - Transfer A : maze path different layout acquisition ( five repetition ) ; - Transfer B : acquisition maze , however carry non-dominant hand ( five repetition ) ; - Transfer 3 : acquisition maze start-end point path reverse ( five repetition ) .</detailed_description>
