	<brief_summary>Neck pain common diagnosis physical therapy , specifically thoracic manipulation , show effective treatment . Thoracic manipulation , involve quick thrust type push segment midback region spine , show decrease pain improve function individual neck pain . However , know test accurately identify individual neck pain would respond favorably thoracic technique . The Cervical-Thoracic Differentiation Test ( CTDT ) test use clinically differentiate pain originate either cervical ( neck ) thoracic ( midback ) region spine individual neck pain . It also speculate specific unloading test , tester selectively unloads portion weight cervical thoracic spine manual distraction may help determine respond favorably thoracic treatment . To best knowledge , despite widespread clinical use , test test validity reliability time . Therefore , purpose research ass reliability criterion reference validity CTDT unloading test , well examine relationship test baseline subject characteristic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Cervical Thoracic Differentiation Testing Individuals With Neck Pain : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research aim hypothesis : Aim 1 : Evaluate inter-tester reliability CTDT regional ( cervical thoracic ) unload test Ho1 : The CTDT regional unloading test demonstrate reliability great κ=.75 Ha1 : The CTDT regional unloading test demonstrate reliability great κ=.75 Aim 2 : Determine difference pain response follow thoracic manipulation subject positive negative CTDT result . Ho2 : There difference response ( change pain , VAS ) follow thoracic manipulation participant positive CTDT negative CTDT result Ha2 : There statistically significant difference response ( change pain , VAS ) individual positive CTDT result compare negative CTDT result Aim 3 : Determine relationship exist CTDT result result cervical thoracic unloading test . Ho3 : There statistically significant correlation CTDT result result unload test Ha3 : There significant correlation positive CTDT result positive thoracic unload result Aim 4 : Determine relationship exist overall result ( responder/non-responder ) CTDT result Ho4 : There significant relationship responder status CTDT result Ha4 : There significant relationship , Φ &gt; .06 , responder status CTDT result . Aim 5 : Determine relationship exist overall result ( responder/non-responder ) various demographic factor ( Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) score , age , pain level , duration symptom ) A total 50 subject recruit trial . All subject first complete brief screen questionnaire determine study eligibility . All eligible subject undergo informed consent process include opportunity question answer . Once consent obtain , subject screen licensed physical therapist rule contraindication study participation . Subjects also complete neck disability index ( NDI ) . This questionnaire use baseline variable ensure group equality level self perceive disability due neck pain . This study consist two distinct , concurrent , phase . The first consist reliability phase . A total 20 subject test two trained examiner day CTDT two unload test . These 20 subject part large subject pool , sample convenience base availability two examiner day enrollment . Each investigator perform CTDT ; additionally investigator perform cervical distraction test separate thoracic distraction test . These finding record , second investigator ( blinded result first investigator ) repeat test allow determination inter-rater reliability . Upon completion reliability testing , subject proceed directly intervention phase study . Subjects enrol day one examiner available , 20 subject assessed reliability , enroll directly second phase . The intervention phase include thoracic manipulation intervention . Subjects first ask complete visual analog pain scale , rest move head painful position . In event subject equal pain rotation side , ask choose bothersome side reference criterion . The CTDT unloading test perform describe . For subject , investigator perform two supine thoracic thrust manipulation . Post-intervention , subject repeat VAS rest provocative position . Change pain VAS compare subject 's FINAL trial CTDT unloading test data analysis . Specific test intervention : VAS Pain assess subject use 100mm VAS , rest provocative position . This administer pre post manipulation measure change . Subject rating pain VAS measure blind examiner aware CTDT group assignment . Cervico-thoracic differentiation test ( CTDT ) Subjects tested via CTDT describe Evjenth &amp; Gloeck . The test reportedly differentiate pain originate cervical upper thoracic region . The test perform subject sit erect posture describe Dunleavy Goldberg , investigator facing . Subjects ask move full cervical range motion ( ROM ) direction ( flexion , extension , right rotation , leave rotation ) find painful direction . They ask move painful cervical motion pain come . The investigator note position consider motion interest outcome analysis , subject complete VAS pain experience position . The subject return head/neck rest posture ; thoracic spine position opposite provocative cervical direction , participant ask repeat painful cervical motion examiner hold subject new thoracic position . This position cervical spine note investigator , investigator ask subject : `` Are symptoms 'better ' , 'worse ' , 'the ' '' ? A positive test include response 'better ' , well 'the ' significant improvement cervical motion ( operationally define 10 degree ) obtain . A negative test include response 'worse ' , well 'the ' significant improvement cervical motion observe . Cervical unload The cervical unloading test perform described Kaltenborn . This test involve unload cervical upper thoracic vertebra . The test perform subject sit erect posture investigator stand behind . If subject pain neutral cervical position , cervical unloading perform investigator neutral posture . However , subject pain neutral cervical position , cervical unloading perform cervical spine position identify provocative . In scenario , cervical unloading consist investigator gently lift upward subject 's head unload his/her cervical spine . The subject ask report his/her pain 'better ' , 'worse ' , 'the ' . A positive test indicate subject report 'better ' , negative test indicate subject report 'worse ' 'the ' . Thoracic unload The thoracic unload test perform described Kaltenborn . This test involve unload thoracic vertebra . The test perform subject sit erect posture investigator stand behind . If subject pain neutral position , thoracic unload perform investigator neutral posture . However , subject pain neutral position , thoracic unload perform cervical spine position identify concordant sign . In scenario , subject ask cross arm put hand opposite upper arm . Thoracic unload consists investigator gently lift upward subject 's elbow unload his/her thoracic spine . The subject ask report his/her pain 'better ' , 'worse ' , 'the ' . A positive test indicate subject report 'better ' , negative test indicate subject report 'worse ' 'the ' . Grade V thrust manipulation Supine grade V thrust manipulation perform described Cleland Karas . The supine technique select show elicit great change pain compare seat technique , readily apply upper thoracic region prone technique . First , examiner ass joint play segment upper thoracic spine . The hypomobile ( stiff ) and/or painful segment T1-T4 determine examiner 's discretion , segment examiner apply thrust . The manipulation perform subject lie supine . The examiner use 'pistol grip ' apply pressure articular pillar select thoracic segment bilaterally order block inferior vertebra hypomobile segment . The subject cross his/her arm his/her chest point his/her elbow align . This allow examiner apply pressure elbow anterior-to-posterior direction . The examiner assure direction force felt his/her stabilize hand . The subject ask take deep breath exhale completely . A grade V thrust apply end subject 's exhalation . If cavitation heard felt either subject examiner , second thrust perform . After completion manipulation , subject return erect sit position ask complete second VAS , rest predetermine provocative position . A-prioi level significance establish p=.05 level . Data analyze quantitatively aggregate form . Inter rater reliability assess Kappa statistic . Groups ( CTDT + , - ) analyze baseline difference age , gender , NDI score , direction concordant sign , chronicity . Tests difference utilized ass statistically significant difference positive negative CTDT response group . This include t-tests non-parametric equivalent test within group change ; selection base normality data/meeting parametric assumption . Criterion reference validity CTDT regional unloading test determine use responder analysis . The reference criterion pain relief meeting/not meeting minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) VAS follow thoracic manipulation ( intervention purportedly indicate result positive CTDT ) . Subjects identify responders/non-responders base change VAS score concordant position , pre-post manipulation . The classification responder determine exceed establish MCID 100mm VAS , report change least 15mm 20 % . The statistical relationship responder status CTDT test response analyze dichotomous nominal variable , assess via Fisher 's Exact Test .</detailed_description>
