	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study brain process result thought language disorder influence outcome see patient schizophrenia use combination brain scan clinical assessment . The project ass patient various stage psychosis ( first episode chronic stage &gt; 3 year illness ) refer Prevention Early Intervention Psychosis Programme use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI scan ) . To track outcome illness , investigator follow-up patient 3 year collect MRI scan four session patient . Participants also complete clinical assessment examine symptom function per current clinical practice within PEPP program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The objective study investigate pathophysiology Formal Thought Disorder variable outcome early stage schizophrenia . In particular , investigator aim test hypothesis 1 . Anatomical abnormality involve grey matter Anterior Insula Medial Prefrontal Cortex first episode schizophrenia predicts FTD persist 6 month illness 2 . An excess glutamine/glutamate Medial Prefrontal Cortex index episode associate persistent FTD 3.Aberrant connectivity Anterior Insula Medial Prefrontal Cortex specifically predict severity persistent FTD irrespective stage illness ; change connectivity track variable 3-year outcome among patient first episode psychosis . METHODS : This study employ cross-sectional design recruit n=126 participant Prevention &amp; Early Intervention Program Psychoses ( PEPP ) . Two group participant assess : patient later stage schizophrenia ( chronic illness group ) ( n=42 ) , newly refer first episode group PEPP patient data prospectively collect ( n=84 ) . Measurements : Patients diagnose use criterion schizophrenia accord DSM-V ( 34 ) . Demographic variable age , gender parental socioeconomic status record adjust potential confounding effect . Patients undergo baseline assessment assess seven feature FTD ( poverty speech , weaken goal , perseveration , looseness , peculiar word usage , peculiar sentence usage peculiar logic ) line validate procedure administer Thought Language Index [ TLI ] ( 17 ) . First episode patient undergo four 7T MRI scan session course 2.5 year ( baseline , 6 month , 18 month , 30 month ) last 60 minute , describe previous work ( 15 ) . During time , researcher perform MR spectroscopy ( MPFC voxel ( 31 ) ) , T1 weight structural scan eyes-closed , task-free , 6 minute resting-state functional MRI . 6 month onset first episode , clinical assessment repeat use TLI . Patients persistent FTD identify ( previous study , 40 % patient expect persistent FTD ( 9 ) ) separate patient FTD 6-months time point . Patients establish illness undergo 2 scan : baseline 1 year later .</detailed_description>
