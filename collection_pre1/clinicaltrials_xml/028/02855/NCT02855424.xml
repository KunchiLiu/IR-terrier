	<brief_summary>Poor cardiopulmonary endurance observe individual acute stroke , even chronic . In addition , poor fitness may obstacle activity daily life , decrease activity autonomic system , increase risk recurrent , therefore , cardiopulmonary endurance training include early-stage rehabilitation program . The ergocycling training could improve cardiopulmonary endurance individual stroke . Moreover , low-intensity exercise training increase willingness , safe moderate-intensity exercise training . However , need evaluate whether low-intensity exercise training bring sufficient benefit , compare moderate-intensity exercise training . Objectives study compare exercise benefit low-intensity moderate-intensity exercise training , would offer optimal exercise prescription consideration clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Leg Cycling Exercise Program Low Moderate Intensity Individuals With Subacute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After give signed consent , subject would randomly assign control group ( traditional rehabilitation ) , low-intensity exercise group ( traditional rehabilitation plus low-intensity exercise training ) , moderate-intensity exercise group ( traditional rehabilitation plus moderate-intensity exercise training ) . Frequency exercise train 2-6 times/week , totally 20 time . In symptom-limit exercise tolerance test , subject wear gas-collecting mask electrocardiogram , pre-set graduate loading offer bike . One therapists one doctor would monitor test . For resistance time set within exercise training , customize result exercise tolerance test baseline allocation . Moreover , therapist would stay subject , monitor training , measure blood pressure training .</detailed_description>
