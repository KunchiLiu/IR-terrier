	<brief_summary>The specific aim study determine whether perforate fat injection plantar fascia safe method improve pain , quality life , reduce plantar fascia thickness patient chronic plantar fasciitis . We also correlate intrinsic fat property adipose stem cell ( ie . growth factor ) improvement pain , quality life , plantar fascia thickness time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perforating Fat Injections Plantar Fasciosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Evaluate safety perforate fat injection plantar fascia patient chronic plantar fasciitis improve pain , quality life , thickness fascia . Rationale : Perforating fat injection show improve multiple scar fibrotic condition burn scar contracture , breast radiation injury , Dupuytren 's contracture hand . ( 5-7 ) It think perforation allow expansion tissue , fill fat allows regenerative heal process , rather inflammatory scar heal process . Hypothesis : Perforating fat injection chronically thicken plantar fascia safe method improve pain , quality life , reduce tissue thickness . Aim 2 : Correlate intrinsic fat property lipoaspirate improvement function plantar fascia thickness . Rationale : Adipose tissue contains adipose derived stem cell . Various growth factor release stem cell may local effect soft tissue ( ie . VEGF ) . ( 8 ) These stem cell think promote regenerative healing , rather scar formation may ultimately improve thickness plantar fascia . ( 9-12 ) Hypothesis : Intrinsic fat property lipoaspirate ( adipose stem cell characteristic ) closely correlated improvement quality life thickness plantar fascia .</detailed_description>
