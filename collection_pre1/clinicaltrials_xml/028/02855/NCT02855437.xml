	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine feasibility acceptability use different remote data collection technology ascertain flare occurrence among gout patient . Two technology focus study : telephone base interactive voice response ( IVR ) smartphone mobile application ( call RheumPRO ) . The result study guide research approach clinical trial , may also direct implication monitor patient outcome context day-to-day clinical practice . The investigator hypothesize acceptability great RheumPRO application IVR . Additionally , investigator hypothesize RheumPRO associate great frequency patient-initiated interaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Methods Ascertainment Gout Flares -A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute gout flare major cause morbidity . Flares lead substantial reduction health-related quality life , increase work absenteeism , productivity loss , substantial healthcare cost . Acute gout flare likely related 174,000 emergency department visit U.S. annually correspond charge approach $ 166 million ( 1 ) . In recent survey , gout patient healthcare provider alike identify reduction gout flare high priority outcome examine future comparative effectiveness study urate lower therapy ( ULT ) ( unpublished result ) . Despite consensus importance capture flare , clinical trial investigate ULTs ( 2-6 ) anti-inflammatory prophylaxis ( 7 ) use inconsistent flare definition method flare ascertainment . The inconsistency likely driven absence standardize definition ascertainment method . These deficit limit comparison make across investigation . Recently , group support American College Rheumatology &amp; European League Against Rheumatism ( ACR &amp; EULAR ) attempt define gout flare ( 8-10 ) . For simplicity , group focus define flare occur definitive gout diagnosis . Nine element flare definition emerge first two study ( 8 , 9 ) . These nine element include physician report information , laboratory data patient self-report . In third study , Gaffo et al . compare discriminatory ability self-reported item gold standard rheumatologist 's judgment flare presence ( 10 ) . Self-report 4 criterion great discriminatory ability area curve ( AUC ) 0.931 ( 10 ) . These promising result indicate important role standardize self-report definition gout flare . In addition variability gout flare definition , optimal method obtain self-reported flare remain undefined . An early study febuxostat , example , assess flare weekly physician visit ( 2 ) . Another study count flare treat healthcare provider ( 4 ) . Still study assess flare physician visit occur variable time point ( 3 , 6 ) . These inconsistent method also pose practical limitation give time resource intensive nature . Opportunities increase efficiency recently become available validation self-reported definition gout flare describe . Self-report combined technological advance remote data collection develop novel highly efficient method identify gout flare . The investigator propose study address press need leverage technological advance facilitate remote real-time collection patient report flare outcome ( PROs ) gout .</detailed_description>
