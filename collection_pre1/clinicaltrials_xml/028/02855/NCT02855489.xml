	<brief_summary>This study three primary goal . First , design distinct intervention target three core construct Theory Planned Behavior ( i.e , attitude , norm , perceive behavioral control ( PBC ) ) . The second goal determine combination Theory Planned Behavior construct successful change condom use behavior among college student . Finally , investigator examine impact change target construct target intervention . The current study intend empirically test construct ( i.e. , attitude , norm , PBC ) Theory Planned Behavior influence increase condom use college student .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Theory allow researcher systematically explain predict health behavior provide organize framework approach research question ; importance theory particularly emphasize meta-analyses demonstrate intervention design basis health behavior theory successful theory-based . The superiority theory-based intervention establish , meta-analyses answer important question theoretical construct may `` active ingredient '' change construct particular theory may work separately versus combination produce great amount behavior change . Health intervention whole small moderate effect behavior change , perhaps partly due lack solid understanding key theoretical construct influence motivate behavior change . Often time theory used basis intervention subset construct seem produce behavior change , call question sufficiency current theory produce behavior change . One possible reason may current health behavior theory really theory behavioral prediction behavior change . Health behavior theory often use inform intervention developmentâ€”assuming cognitive process successfully explain behavior also process targeted elicit behavior change . Past review show theory like Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) explain 30 % -50 % variance behavior , behavior change outcome predictor produce small moderate effect . However , unclear predictor work together similar way use explain behavior versus create behavior change . Currently , cognitive mechanism use describe process , explain behavior may one produce behavior change . There little literature address process may differ . A careful examination extent current theoretical construct successfully produce behavior change individually combination may help clarify optimal theoretical framework utilized behavior change intervention . Using Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) guide theoretical framework , study explores one way experimentally determine construct TPB influence successfully produce health behavior change .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants must 18 old must vaginal anal intercourse least . Prior research indicate predictor condom use dramatically different casual versus serious relationship condom use extremely difficult change among establish longterm relationship . Thus , exclude participant indicate relationship classify relationship someone `` living '' `` marry '' .</criteria>
