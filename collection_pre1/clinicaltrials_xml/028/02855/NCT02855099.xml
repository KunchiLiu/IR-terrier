	<detailed_description>Many patient encounter month post TAVI , still complain symptom limit daily activity . The investigator set study whether rehabilitation strategy early procedure contribute reduction physical disability patient suffer . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) well-established treatment patient underwent cardiac surgery . Patients TAVI , natural candidate referral exercise-based CR . Despite , 2013 data available safety efficacy comprehensive rehabilitative period subject . Nicola Russo et al . compare safety efficacy structure , exercise-based CR program octogenarian traditional sAVR vs. TAVI , conclude short-term , supervised , exercise-based CR feasible , safe effective octogenarian patient TAVI well traditional surgery . An early CR program enhances independence , mobility functional capacity encourage patient . Long-term effect prognostic relevance evaluate future study . A similar comparison assess hypothesis patient TAVI benefit CR , compare patient surgical aortic-valve replacement ( sAVR ) . They conclude patient TAVI benefit cardiac rehabilitation despite old age comorbidities . CR helpful tool maintain independency daily life activity participation socio-cultural life . The conclusion make Ivan Fauch√®re et al . letter editor - patient TAVI group old sicker SAVR patient . Despite difference , patient group benefit way post-acute in-patient rehabilitation program assess 6-Minute Walking Tests FIM score . Another study , draw cohort 484 patient severe symptomatic AS underwent TAVI , evaluate association physical performance estimate 6-minute walk test distance ( 6MWTD ) long-term prognosis TAVI . They find compare 6MWTD median value , unable walk experience high rate death TAVI . In contrast , patient unable walk slow walker baseline experienced improvement functional status TAVI , whereas fast walker improve actually experience modest decrease 6MWTD . It show patient refer rehabilitation TAVI often frail , high grade functional impairment , dependence others high risk clinical complication . During rehabilitation program , base multidimensional assessment intervention , patient show significant improvement functional status , quality life , autonomy , remain stable majority subject mid-term follow-up . To investigator knowledge , prospective study compare rehabilitation strategy conservative treatment TAVI . investigator set test hypothesize CR may help short long term prognosis patient .</detailed_description>
