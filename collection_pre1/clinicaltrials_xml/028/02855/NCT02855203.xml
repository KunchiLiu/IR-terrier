	<criteria>1 . Has provide write informed consent trial . 2 . Be least 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Have oligometastases ( 15 metastasis ) , measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . 4 . Participants must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Oligometastatic lesion need biopsied must clinically consistent represent metastatic disease . 5 . Patient either treatment naïve previously receive 2 line systemic treatment ( eg . Pazopanib Sunitinib ) . The total number metastasis throughout pretrial period number 5 . 6 . Must surgical consideration metastasectomy think appropriate SABR due medical inoperability , technical factor patient decline surgery . 7 . Must least one metastasis SABR technically deliverable . 8 . Be willing provide archival tissue previously biopsied excised primary metastatic RCC lesion ( available ) . If safe , request newly obtain specimen ( obtain 4 week prior initiation treatment ) make , however participation biopsy entirely optional . 9 . Have performance status 02 ECOG Performance Scale 10 . Demonstrate adequate organ function define screen lab perform within 10 day registration . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 X 10^9/L Platelets ≥100 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min participant creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN participant total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN participant liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant 11 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 month . 12 . Be willing able comply study requirement , include treatment , attend assessment followup . 13 . Female participant childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 14 . Female participant childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( see Section 9.4.2 : Contraception ) . Participants childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 15 . Male participant agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy 1 . Based clinician assessment disease volume rate progression patient 's tumor deposit , patient require immediate TKI therapy . 2 . Has previous high dose radiotherapy ( biological equivalent 30Gy 10 # ) area treat include vertebral body ( see ) . Note : Previous high dose radiotherapy define biological equivalent dose 30 Gy 10 fraction use alpha/beta ratio [ 82 ] 3 . Where patient receive radiotherapy equivalent low dose define , stereotactic radiotherapy area may consider . In , assessment volume total dose receive overlap region must make , documented generate cumulative plan incorporate previous current treatment field . It treat radiation oncologist 's responsibility review current plan cumulative plan inclusive previous radiotherapy . 3 . Has evidence untreated active intracranial metastasis . Patients fully resect brain metastasis control stereotactic radiotherapy eligible long require corticosteroid symptomatic control . 4 . Has evidence Spinal Cord Compression . 5 . Has Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ≥ 7 unless lesion review neurosurgical service consider stable ( see Appendix 3 ) . 6 . Requires surgical fixation bone lesion stability . This must perform enrollment trial . 7 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day registration . 8 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . 9 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 10 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week registration recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 11 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week registration recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Participants ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If participant receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 12 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 13 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Participants previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid within 7 day registration . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 14 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 15 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 16 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 17 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere participant 's participation full duration trial , best interest participant participate , opinion treat investigator . 18 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 19 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 20 .
