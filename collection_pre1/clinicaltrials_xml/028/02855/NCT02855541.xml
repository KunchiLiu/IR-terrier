	<brief_summary>Previous research suggest prolong sit increase risk cardiometabolic disease risk factor associate cardiometabolic disease . However , study date examine chronic intervention break prolong sit real-world environment result reduction metabolic risk factor associate cardiometabolic disease . Thus , objective study examine potential health benefit break sit bout throughout workday use small cycling device ( DeskCycle ) office worker involve job require prolong bout sit . The investigator hypothesize break sit associated improvement cardiometabolic disease risk factor . More specifically , investigator hypothesize break sit decrease blood glucose oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , increase cardiorespiratory fitness ( VO2max ) , decrease blood pressure , decrease body fat , increase HDL cholesterol , decrease LDL cholesterol , total cholesterol , triglyceride .</brief_summary>
