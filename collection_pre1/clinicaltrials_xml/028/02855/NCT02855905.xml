	<brief_summary>A cold season involve high cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Several epidemiologic study implicate person cardiac disease , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) may high risk adverse health event , mechanisms well establish . Because exercise cold exposure stimulate cardiac circulatory function important study interaction especially among people CAD whose myocardial oxygen supply function weaken . The study examines recommend health-enhancing upper low body exercise warm-up combination cold exposure affect cardiovascular function people CAD . The research include randomize controlled experiment participant 35-75 year old men CAD ( CCS I-II ) recruit Oulu University Hospital . Each participant undergo four different trial random order temperature ( +22°C -15°C ) form exercise ( brisk walk 5.5 km/h upper body exercise 30 W ) , warm-up regime vary . The used exercise , clothing exposure resemble ordinary wintertime exercise event . Novel technique use broadly assess cardiovascular function , recovery phase . The obtained information synthesize translate tailored year-round exercise instruction people CAD research team include expert sport science , physiology , public occupational health , clinical science complementary knowledge physical activity , effective intervention cardiovascular function . The study broad national international impact relatively passive age population CAD reside work cold climate . The produced information enable find mean activate person CAD appropriate safe year-round exercise may reduce prevent adverse health effect . Health care personnel improve possibility prescribe physical activity program client enable good instruction healthy safe exercise way promote health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Year-round Health Enhancing Exercise Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction National International significance research According worldwide estimate 42 % people coronary artery disease ( CAD ) physically inactive . There approximately 200 000 person Finland CAD , even connect health problem ( high cholesterol blood pressure , diabetes ) weaken cardiac function physical capacity cause mortality . This increase age population often inactive , would benefit substantially regular year-round physical activity maintain functional ability independent living . At present know whether exercise recommendation CAD patient involve health risk cold exposure regularly report symptom chest pain arrhythmias winter . Because exercise cold exposure stimulate cardiac circulatory function precise physical activity require define interaction among CAD patient whose myocardial oxygen supply function weaken . Nationally internationally research address large special population group live northern hemisphere , whose symptom , health event mortality common provoke cold season . A passive lifestyle population partially due inadequate instruction guidance . As result age proportion people CAD increase emphasize role prevention reduce health care cost . The propose research entity form important part research program examine direct effect temperature human health newly establish WHO Collaboration Centre Global change , Environment Public Health . Aims hypotheses The aim : 1 ) study separate combine effect upper low body exercise warm-up cardiovascular response ( acute , recovery ) 2 ) translate research information tailor instruction year-round physical activity . The hypothesis : 1 ) moderate level endurance exercise increase cardiovascular strain CAD patient cold compare warm environment , 2 ) upper body exercise strenuous low body exercise cold , 3 ) warm-up exercise attenuate cold exercise induce rise BP Participants The participant 35-75-year old men ( non-smokers ) CAD ( NYHA CCS I-II ) , experience myocardial infarction 3 month ago , hypertension metabolic , cardiovascular respiratory disease . The participant recruit Oulu University Hospital experience cardiologist . The exclusion criterion : smoking , asthma , CCS class III-IV , diabetes , previous myocardial infarction le 3 month ago , chronic atrial fibrillation , claudication , unstable angina pectoris , serious complex arrhythmia ECG anomalies rest . Randomized control study ( n=160 ) The randomize controlled study allow understand causality physiological mechanism separate combine effect exercise cold cardiovascular function person CAD . Phase I ( 2015-16 ) : Separate combine effect cold exercise cardiovascular function . Each participant ( n=20 ) randomly expose four condition separately neutral ( +22°C ) cold ( -15°C ) environment rest exercise . Phase II ( 2016-17 ) : Type exercise warm-up cardiovascular function exercise cold . Each participant ( n=20 ) randomly expose four condition involve low ( brisk walking ) upper body ( arm ergometry ) exercise cold ( -15°C ) without warm-up exercise +22°C . Each experimental session last 105 min ( 15 min baseline + 30 min exposure + 60 min recovery ) . Ambient condition The participant expose +22°C -15°C ( wind 1.4. m/s ) 30 min per experimental session wind tunnel Kastelli Research Centre . The used cold exposure simulate condition occur frequently winter cold climate . The participant equip winter clothing experiment . The cold exposure largely restricted face know increase BP ca . 20 mmHg healthy subject . Study protocol The experimental session perform time day participant . Instructions avoid heavy exercise alcohol 48 h coffee/caffeine relate beverage 3 h prior experiment give . The participant inform research , provide write consent participate study possibility get acquaint experimental condition . A questionnaire inquire health lifestyle participant fill . Following body composition subject assess bioimpedance . A baseline blood sample drawn . After subject equip skin temperature thermistor arm cuff ( BP ) . ECG-electrodes attached online ( 12-lead ) long term ( 24 h ) monitoring cardiac function . Subjects follow neutral condition 15 minute ( baseline ) . Continuous beat-to-beat BP , central aortic blood pressure flow mediate dilation record exposure neutral/cold temperature rest/exercise . For exercise cold subject equip winter clothing enter experimental condition ( wind tunnel ) . During exercise cardiovascular function follow continuously real-time ECG . BP measure every third minute rest exercise . Physical strain assess 1- minute thermal sensation 5-minute interval . The termination criterion include ST-depression 2 mm , symptom angina , well sudden considerable change BP . The termination experiment decide paramedic nurse monitoring medical doctor supervise experimental session . After end exercise cardiovascular function follow 30 minute 22°C . A blood sample take immediately exercise . Continuous central BP measure 3-8 minute follow exercise ( early recovery ) 15-20 minute ( delayed recovery ) . The subject return 48-hours experiment provide blood sample enables examine immediate delayed effect hematological parameter ( blood coagulation factor , inflammation marker , endothelin ) .

International co-operation include University Texas Southwestern Medical Center University Maastricht . The experiment conduct unique thermal laboratory Kastelli Research Centre Oulu comprehensive novel equipment assessment circulatory , respiratory , autonomic nervous system function thermal balance . The research team multidisciplinary consist expert sport science , physiology , medicine , rehabilitation , wellness technology . Adjunct professor Tiina Ikäheimo ( former Mäkinen ) , Ph.D. , lecturer CERH , University Oulu ; PI research special expertise physiology effect temperature human health performance . The PI produce several original publication review produce texts national international professional book ( e.g . WHO ) cold-related health risk recommendation prevention .
