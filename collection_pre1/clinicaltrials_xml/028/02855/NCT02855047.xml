	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate plasmatic concentration free PGF sFlt1 blood sample take first low-molecular-weight-heparin injection also blood sample take 4th day injection ( latter correspond first systematic control platelet count ) woman obstetric antiphospholipid antibody syndrome initiate new pregnancy recommend treatment . Our goal test prognostic value data occurrence : - pregnancy loss categorize embryonic loss ( 10 week gestation ) , fetal death ( 20 week gestation ) , stillbirth ( 20 week gestation delivery ) , neonatal death define reach 28 day age . - ischemic placental pathology ( pre-eclampsia , retro-placental hematoma , birth small-for-gestational-age infant )</brief_summary>
