	<brief_summary>The application infrared thermal image diagnosis prognostication septic illness adult . During time severe infection ( sepsis ) , small blood vessel supply oxygen nutrient skin organ ( call microcirculation ) , become abnormal function normally would health . Monitoring small blood vessel difficult clinically investigator want investigate new way . The aim study validate novel method assess function microcirculation healthy volunteer patient sepsis , measure skin temperature profile leg face thermal image camera . Thermal image camera measure heat give object represent picture , colour use represent different temperature . Patients recruit Emergency Department Intensive Care Units University Hospitals Leicester one two group base illness severity ; uncomplicated sepsis severe sepsis . Healthy volunteer recruit third group . Recruitment take place 6-month period follow-up lasting 12-months follow recruitment . 105 participant recruit total . Temperature pattern see face leg investigate different group . Changes temperature pattern patient recover sepsis ( indeed become bad ) , also investigate . Information thermal image correlate routinely measure marker infection , include clinical measurement ( blood pressure , pulse , etc ) routine blood investigation .</brief_summary>
