	<brief_summary>tracheal stenosis result abnormal wound-healing process lead hypertrophic scar formation obstruction airway lumen excess granulation tissue . This process progressive treatment prevention essential . Resection-anastomosis trachea become standard care many center give consistent result adult pediatric patient . But recurrence stenosis , re-granulation re-inflammation probable . This study aim assess efficacy systemic prednisolone prevention recurrent tracheal stenosis surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Effect Systemic Steroids Treatment Prevention Recurrent Tracheal Stenosis Postoperative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tracheal stenosis affect 4-13 % adult occur 1-8 % neonate prolonged intubation United States . The cause adult ' tracheal stenosis include trauma , chronic inflammatory disease , benign neoplasm , malignant neoplasm collagen vascular disease . The common cause tracheal stenosis continue trauma , internal ( prolonged endotracheal intubation , tracheostomy , flame , burn injury ) external ( neck trauma ) . Approximately 90 % chronic subglottic stenosis child adult result endotracheal intubation tracheostomy 10 % result cause . The resection anastomosis effective treatment cure condition . The treatment mechanical dilation ( dilator , rigid bronchoscope ) , stent , laser co2 , diode , cold knife . But effective resection anastomosis . Rigid bronchoscope dilator may shear mucosa leading damage . Resection damage segment airway , approximation anastomosis two intact end mean fine synthetic absorbable suture minimum tension . Steroids anti-inflammatory effect widely use first line therapy condition . Patients underwent resection anastomosis 2014-2016 treatment post-intubation tracheal stenosis include study . Systemic prednisolone use treatment prevention recurrent tracheal stenosis post-operative patient . Post-operative patient divide two group , one receive prednisolone receive placebo 30 day . The result compare bronchoscopy ( FOB rigid ) 30 day .</detailed_description>
