	<brief_title>Exploring Patient Physician Experiences Medical Acupuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators obtain sign Informed Consent Document HIPAA Authorization . During screen process , data gather race , ethnicity , gender , history , satisfaction rating prior acupuncture receive , whether acupuncture decrease reliance prescription over-the-counter medication use via Screening Tool . Acknowledging clinical partnership patient provider , propose qualitative inquiry seek understand medical acupuncture physician patient perspective . A modified version two interview technique [ Lifeline Interview Method ( LIM ) Retrospective Interview Technique ( RIT ) ] use . From approach , narrative data analyze quantitatively qualitatively provide visual depiction across time . In RIT method , participant receives modify version RIT graph interview . The graph provide participant time reflect experience behavior . The interview one-on-one interview take approximately 90 minute group , include time complete RIT graph interview . Interviewees ask describe experience point diagnosis training present day capture nature experience across treatment trajectory . Questions address nature experience begin first time provider introduce acupuncture patient present day elicit rich detail impact acupuncture social/relational life well perceive psychological physical health . Questions also center role communication facilitate receptivity adherence acupuncture treatment plan term provider-patient interaction patient ' interactive experience within social network . For physician , question address pre-training post-training perception acupuncture well . Ultimately , impact acupuncture patient ' life examine use `` turn point '' approach . By center turn point individual opportunity reflect notable moment change memorable impact health , health behavior well health perception . Such turn point also helpful identify challenge patient physician face regard adopt adhering acupuncture treatment . In approach participant consider treatment impacted life across time plot change ( `` turn point '' ) emerge across treatment trajectory . Time represent horizontal axis graph , impact acupuncture ( perceive participant ) represent vertical axis . Impact treatment consider change capture treatment positive effect ( enhance health , enhance receptivity , adherence ) negative ( inhibit health , facilitate receptivity adherence ) . These turn point always communicatively manage , thus , communicative nature give rise communication factor facilitate treatment health-promoting outcomes well barrier ( thus , contribute treatment perceive beneficial ) . From approach , participant use visual tool ( turn point graph ) plot turn point . Once complete connect point line provide trajectory illustrates treatment impact life across acupuncture treatment ( patient ) treatment impacted live patient ( provider ) . This interview technique help facilitate storied approach participant share insider experience thereby facilitate disclosure natural manner generate narrative data rich intervention-making . This approach allow translational approach research narrative use develop intervention medical education critical facilitating form care . Sample size qualitative data collection base saturation theme ( thematic finding , e.g. , patient talk limit family knowledge physician-patient communication limit time constraint clinical setting , mean investigator continue recruitment investigator longer hear new experience participant . Saturation keep separate group ( i.e. , saturation theme must meet within group patient separately provider ) . Generally saturation meet 10-30 individual within group , depend upon diverse group ( demographic variable may require participant amendment increase approve number enrollment ) . Investigators plan recruit sample provider patient population follow way . Since investigator concerned communication difference base train maturity , investigator group physicians physician 's training investigator sensitive fact helpful patient-physician interaction approach may differ across lifespan experience . Our goal interview physician complete training physician complete training three year prior . Thus , investigator `` newly train '' provider group `` experience '' provider group . For group , investigator ask entirety experience ( point training present day ) analyze data patient-physician communication accord train phase physician . This ensure investigator in-the-moment reflection experience retrospective account . For patient , investigator recruit 2 group : seek treatment either 1 ) chronic 2 ) acute condition . Given gendered difference health behavior perception , investigator aim representative male female population within group . Audio recording interview professionally transcribe analysis concurrent data collection ensure reliability validity finding . Professional transcriptionists complete transcription pseudoanonymous recording . Investigators review transcript data collect identify emergent theme ensure thematic saturation . Qualitative data analyze accord van Manen 's '' selective approach , '' use software program ATLAS.ti.to manage large data set . Three analytical step accord constant comparative method outline Strauss Corbin employ , begin discovery concept assignment code text . The thematic analysis proceeds identify category group related concept reach `` thematic salience , '' reflect recurrence , repetition , forcefulness . The final step involve define theme dimension category ensure thick description . Separate analysis conduct research question group compare across group . Investigators incorporate final set theme action-oriented thematic statement use Banning 's ecological sentence synthesis approach ensure research easily translate practice . These action-oriented statement easily integrated intervention psychosocial material effort enhance provider-patient communication share decision making , health care system , offer patient physician roadmap barrier might impede care practice patient adherence well communication strategy facilitate enhance acupuncture treatment ( patient provider ) .</detailed_description>
