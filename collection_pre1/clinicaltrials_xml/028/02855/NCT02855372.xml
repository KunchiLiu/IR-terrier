	<brief_summary>It commonly accept characteristic organ donor impact future post transplant . In lung transplantation ( LP ) , define characteristic `` ideal '' donor include age less 55 year . However , pulmonary graft shortage correspond mortality still high wait list , lung graft acceptance criterion reassess permit criterion `` extension '' ( `` marginal '' graft ) . And graft , depend urgency accessibility problem registry potential candidate , organs donor age 55 old quite comparable obtain young donor . Nevertheless , common practice graft old donor readily allocate old candidate severe , many confound factor assess real impact donor age post-transplant evolution small cohort . The main goal study compare survival lung transplant patient depend age difference donor recipient . The study conduct broad national cohort lung transplant patient register COLT ( Lung Transplantation COhort ) . Established September 2009 , promote University Hospital Nantes , COLT involve 11 lung transplant center authorize French territory . It provide standardized common longitudinal monitoring recipient transplant . Currently 1,000 patient include study transplant .</brief_summary>
