	<brief_summary>The gut microbiome new target improve burden disease measure mood disorder , yet novel intervention affect gut microbial complement improve psychiatric outcome develop . Animal study show causative influence gut microbiome developmental trajectory central neurochemical system effect anxiety-like depressive-like behavior . Preliminary study humans show psychiatric benefit pre- pro-biotic supplementation depressed individual . However , determine gut microbe beneficial detrimental human mental illness specifically target therapeutic benefit . Our long-term goal determine effective method target human gut microbiome improve mental health treatment outcomes . The objective study determine specific dietary control alter microbiome composition effect clinical outcome measure longitudinal study individual bipolar disorder . Our central hypothesis low carbohydrate ( CHO ) / high polyunsaturated fat ( PUFA ) diet increase fractional representation specific butyrate produce member Firmicutes phylum gut microbiome , attenuate host inflammation , improve sleep quality reduce anxiety bipolar patient . The rationale propose research take first step continuum study develop personalize novel approach treat mood disorder , include need address gut dysbiosis , often co-occurs mental illness . The investigator test hypothesis achieve objective proposal follow Specific Aims : 1 ) Determine taxonomical change stool microbiome follow low CHO / high PUFA diet ; 2 ) Determine change sleep quality , anxiety , depression follow low CHO / high PUFA diet . These aim achieve use unique resource University Michigan , include Nutrition Assessment Laboratory dietary intervention , Host-Microbiome Laboratory microbial assay , ongoing Prechter Longitudinal Study Bipolar Disorder . At end propose study investigator expect set stage future study assess neurochemical mechanism . These data provide great understand mechanism diet control specific microbe gut microbiome affect mood disorder gut dysbiosis improve response psychiatric treatment paradigm .</brief_summary>
