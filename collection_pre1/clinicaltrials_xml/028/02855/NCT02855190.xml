	<brief_summary>This open-labelled two-arm pilot comparative prospective study . All subject undergo image assessment two stage exchange arthroplasty surgery . At first stage , enrol subject receive FDG Ga68 citrate PET/CT scan first operation periprosthetic Joint Infection ( PJI ) . Thus , test result FDG Ga68 individual obtain . After first operation , surgery/biopsy proof obtain gold standard . The subject PJI negative complete process first stage . And second stage study base subject positive PJI first operation . They receive FDG Ga68 citrate PET/MR scan antibiotic bone cement implant . The sensitivity/accuracy two tracer PET/MR calculate compare . This stage aim answer whether PET/MR scan feasible image tool provide diagnostic information infection control status resection arthroplasty hip/knee PJIs , especially implantation antibiotic load bone cement . In second stage , investigator shift image modality PET/MR base follow reason : ( 1 ) MRI radiation burden ; ( 2 ) MRI provide accurate tissue contrast information therefore well anatomic delineation ; ( 3 ) currently study indicate existence ABLC may hamper interpretation image . The study duration expect complete period 3 year . It plan enroll total 50 subject suspicious infection . And investigator expect PJI prevalence around 60 % , i.e . anticipated number subject true PJI around 30 . The sample size prevalence give base clinical availability consideration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The recruited subject subject periprosthetic joint infection undergo total four PET scan two different stage . At first stage , subsequent FDG PET/CT Ga68 citrate PET/CT scan different two day arrange infective prosthesis remove . Eight twelve week 1st stage operation , patient receive two subsequent PET/MR scan use Ga-68 Citrate FDG different two day , respectively . The PET image visually examine nuclear medicine physician report abnormal uptake high background location standard uptake value ( SUV ) . The CT/MR image report radiologist use standard reading procedure , respectively . The lesion PET scan correlate computed tomography magnetic resonance image , final sensitivity , specificity , accuracy calculate accord histopathology result composite clinical laboratory data . On scan day use Ga68-Citrate , baseline electrocardiogram , complete blood count ( CBC ) , biochemistry profile include serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) creatinine ( Cre ) level do prior injection radio-pharmaceutical ( Ga68-Citrate ) . Vital sign measure scan beginning . After complete exam , electrocardiogram vital sign measure , subject release discomfort . The subject return clinic within 1 week Ga68-citrate scan . CBC , biochemistry profile check safety monitoring .</detailed_description>
