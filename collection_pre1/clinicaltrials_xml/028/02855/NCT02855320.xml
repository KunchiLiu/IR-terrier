	<detailed_description>Background Inflammatory arthritis ( rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) painful chronic disease impair quality life work capacity . Biologics effective widely use therapy . However , know entail risk , particularly infection , pulmonary infection , tuberculosis , case opportunist infections.. The risk severe infection 5 % /patient-year maximum first six month initiation first biologic therapy . Patient education ( PE ) recommend management chronic disease . In case biologics , PE aim help patient learn specific skill particularly safety issue , e.g stop biologic treatment case fever surgery . Safety skill assess validated BIOSECURE questionnaire , 54 item questionnaire assess patient competence deal fever , infection , vaccination , daily life situation ie travel , surgery , pregnancy . PE seem efficient safety skill non-randomized study . In 2010 national cross sectional survey 677 patient show risk incorrect answer BIOSECURE questionnaire 4 time low among patient benefit education nurse kind educational process ( OR =3,8 IC95 % : [ 1,68-8,8 ] . Although PE recommend , small rate patient propose PE : national survey 30 % patient face face nurse consultation 11 % patient nurse consultation part self-management program . When biotherapy initiate , initiation period know critical patient motivation adherence , particularly patient treat sub cutaneous biotherapy . However , evidence nurse lead consultation improve adherence propose initiation period . Aims Hypothesis : trial aim investigate , primary outcome , effect nurse-led self-management education face face intervention safety skills patient arthritis treat par sub cutaneous biologics . Our hypothesis intervention group report good skill 6 month follow compare usual care i.e information rheumatologist current consultation . As treatment initiation period importance , trial also include , secondary outcome , adherence biologic treatment disease activity . Our hypothesis nurse intervention increase motivation adherence positive effect disease activity , patient 's quality life coping , well self-efficacy . Methods : multicentric randomize control open trial blind assessment primary outcome . The pre selection visit take place medical consultation . The rheumatologist check eligibility criterion . Eligible patient receive write information invite participate RCT . The pre selection visit selection visit possibly do medical consultation . At selection visit M0 , patient sign non-opposition form , assessed baseline characteristic complete questionnaire . The randomization schedule prepare biostatistician use computer-generated random number . The randomization take place medical consultation completion baseline assessment , order preserve blinding . After randomization , participant either intervention group ( IG ) control group ( CG ) . Patients intervention group refer nurse , day within 2 week ( maximum 4 week ) inclusion . Intervention group . The intervention group benefit nurse intervention addition usual care : follow rheumatologist hospital private care accord usual management biologics treatment . Nurse intervention At M0 , nurse face face intervention include 1/ assessment patient ' health belief educational need towards arthritis treatment semi directive questionnaire enhance communication 2/ Information biologics 3/ specific education safety skills self-injections 4/ Motivational communication biologics treatment . At M3 , nurse communicate patient 's experience motivation reinforce safety message . The MO M3 intervention last approximately 1 hour 30 . The actual duration consultation leave nurse 's appreciation depend patient 's need collect . The nurse intervention standardize physical meeting among center lead development dedicate educational booklet include : component educational diagnosis , assessment patient educational need , safety message motivational message . The elaboration booklet derive previous work BIOSECURE study , recommendation PE previous work educational need arthritis patient . All nurse train patient education self-management ( University 1 year curriculum minimum 40 hour train ) specifically safety issue biologics . Control group . The control group follow rheumatologist hospital private care accord usual management biologics treatment . Baseline characteristic Baseline assessment include demographic feature , age , gender , education level , disease duration , type arthritis ( RA versus SpA ) , disease activity measure DAS 28 ( Disease Activity index ) patient RA BASDAI ( Bath ankylose spondylitis disease activity index ) patient SpA , comorbidities , patient previous self-reported knowledge , adherence conventional DMARDS , quality life ( SF12 ) , cop psychological well-being ( VASs RAID score , AHI Arthritis helplessness index ) , Disease activity ( DAS , ASDAS , BASDAI ) , beliefs medication ( BMQ ) Final assessment Patients group ( IG CG ) assess M6 primary secondary outcome . The administration questionnaires do member multidisciplinary team blind treatment group . An additional nurse consultation propose independently trial patient especially whose safety knowledge prove inadequate M6 assessment .</detailed_description>
