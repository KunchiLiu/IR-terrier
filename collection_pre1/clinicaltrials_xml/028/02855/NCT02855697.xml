	<brief_summary>PARP inhibitor , olaparib , significantly improve progression free survival ( PFS ) participant recurrent , platinum-sensitive high-grade serous/endometrioid ovarian cancer ( HGS/EOC ) , harbour germline mutation BRCA 1 2 gene . Despite impressive hazard ratio see ovarian oncology , improvement PFS translate improved overall survival ( OS ) advantage potentially maintenance poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor ( PARPi ) administer single remission . Here investigator test feasibility administer second course olaparib participant recurrent platinum-sensitive HGS/EOC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-maintenance Olaparib After Disease Recurrence Participants With Platinum Sensitive BRCAm High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer present participant advanced stage curative surgery possible extensive pelvic , abdominal distant metastasis . Immediate delay surgery combine platinum-based chemotherapy standard care even complete surgical cytoreductive technique prescription combination platinum-based chemotherapy , 5 year survival rate remain approximately 35 % . Approximately 50 % ovarian cancer harbour defect HR . Defects pathway arise result genomic epigenetic event one 33 gene . Phase I II clinical trial PARPi , olaparib , show promising result BRCA mutate ( BRCAm ) recurrent EOC proportion HGSOC participant wild type germline BRCA ( BRCA wt ) . Additionally favourable toxicity profile olaparib prompt long-term use PARPi maintenance strategy . The result randomize placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial olaparib maintenance therapy show improvement progression free survival ( PFS ) time progression participant recurrent platinum-sensitive HGSOC6 . Recent data confirm increase median PFS mark BRCAm participant receive olaparib maintenance treatment compare BRCAm participant receive placebo treatment ( 11.2 vs 4.3 month respectively ; HR , 0.18 ; 95 % CI , 0.11-0.31 ; p &lt; 0.00001 ) . These study perform original capsule formulation olaparib dose 400mg bd . Rationale study The improvement PFS maintenance olaparib participant germline BRCA-mutation ( g-BRCAm ) , although particularly striking , translate improved overall survival , presumably subsequent salvage therapy obscure effect . Emerging data indicate significant proportion BRCAm HGSOC participant retain sensitivity platinum agent chemotherapy follow progression olaparib . Thus appropriate offer platinum-containing therapy participant whose disease progress 6 month previous platinum therapy . In whose disease benefit platinum chemotherapy , course olaparib might consolidate gain first course olaparib , improve PFS point OS increase well . However , date trial test feasibility successive treatment 2 course maintenance olaparib issue address , participant harbour germline BRCA defect whose disease recur least stabilised subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy . Functional testing remain gold standard test HR status great predictive accuracy non-functional test . The Rad51 functional assay involve recognition completion HR formation Rad51 focus viable cell undergone DNA damage , recognise γH2AX focus formation . The assay robust reproducible require viable cell derive either participant ascites solid tumour deposit .</detailed_description>
