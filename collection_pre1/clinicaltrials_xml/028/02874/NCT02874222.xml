	<brief_summary>Breast cancer one prevalent cancer 207,090 new case breast cancer 39,840 death woman predict 2010 United States . Aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) use first-line adjuvant therapy postmenopausal woman early stage breast cancer . The effectiveness current therapy widely recognize compromise poor compliance aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptom ( AIMSS ) , syndrome affect 40-50 % woman take medication . The syndrome recognize registration trial class drug , lead discontinuation 24 % woman 2 year . Knowledge use prevent discontinuation important agent severe AIMSS urgently need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cohort Study Evaluate Genetic Predictors Aromatase Inhibitor Musculoskeletal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NCI Division Cancer Prevention recognize AIMSS priority area future study . The symptom associate high rate AI discontinuation therefore compromise survival outcomes great cost patient society . Very little known AIMSS , predict risk condition , discontinue therapy symptom . This study provide basis comprehensive assessment risk factor patient-reported outcome , phenotypic , laboratory level . We explore natural history AIMSS different ethnic population , validate previously report genetic determinant development AIMSS . A common problem multicenter GWAS study large sample size , especially absence measurable diagnostic parameter , inclusion heterogeneous group patient . In addition assess pharmacogenomic predictor , study involve specification pre-defined AIMSS phenotype collection patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) . As , data clinical utility clarify factor associate aromatase inhibitor discontinuation thus guide clinician towards intervention improve adherence . Coupled study , long-term goal develop gene signature use well guide selection endocrine intervention patient breast cancer . The underlie physiology AIMSS remain obscure . A small exploratory case control study find role commonly encounter cytokine AIMSS . The role estrogen estrogen metabolite remain possible explanatory variable , well new cytokine IL-17 . This newly describe cytokine implicate disorder rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease , specifically link articular nociception animal model arthritis . AIMSS Phenotype : The large study date AIs ( ATAC , BIG I-98 , E1Z03 ) limit absence clearly define phenotype AIMSS . Retrospective analysis provide information clearly replace ( PROs ) . The lack good prospective PROs represent major gap well-defined phenotype necessary order identify useful genomic association . Methods evaluate possible predictor use MRI wrist tenosynovitis expensive definitive , patient-reported symptom use may represent useful clinical phenotype .</detailed_description>
