	<brief_title>Low-frequency Electrical Muscle Stimulation v Cycle Training During Haemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End stage renal disease associate reduce functional capacity . Dynamic exercise training i.e . cycling , perform dialysis session dialysis ( intra-dialytic ) effective improve functional capacity quality life . However , many patient unable engage intra-dialytic cycling due limit comorbidities . Other exercise modality consider . Low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation quadriceps well tolerate may improve functional capacity clinical population . The trial longitudinal , randomise control trial . Participants randomly allocate 10 week 1 ) intra-dialytic low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation , 2 ) intra-dialytic cycling , 3 ) usual care haemodialysis without exercise training . Outcomes assessed baseline 10 week assessor blind group allocation .</detailed_description>
