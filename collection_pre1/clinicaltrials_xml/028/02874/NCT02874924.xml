	<brief_summary>The ability mount effective immune response decline age , leave elderly increasingly susceptible infectious disease cancer . Rapamycin , FDA approve drug prevent transplant rejection , increase lifespan healthspan mouse ameliorate age-related decline immune responsiveness , cancer survival , cognition laboratory animal . Investigators conduct translational trial test whether rapamycin also improve life function human focus elderly person ( age 70-95 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect mTOR Inhibition Other Metabolism Modulating Interventions Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibition mTOR pathway rapamycin ( RAPA ) , immunosuppressive drug use adjunct therapy prevent solid organ allograft rejection , enhance longevity mouse . Importantly , RAPA efficacious even initiate relatively old animal . Thus , suggest RAPA could use therapeutically human slow age-associated pathology . Indeed , improvement cognition , control tumorigenesis , enhance certain aspect immunity demonstrate RAPA treat murine model . Moreover , long-term RAPA delivery older mouse associate change immune reactivity evident young animal . Investigators propose expand large cohort old human test hypothesis RAPA treatment , even old individual , result simultaneous improvement system know negatively affected age . Investigators focus immune system , cognition , physical parameter healthy age , walk speed . Investigators recruit healthy volunteer , age 75-95 year , randomize either RAPA placebo , control gender , ethnicity , age . These group use address follow specific aim : Aim 1 . Assess general parameter immune health RAPA treatment ; include serum inflammatory cytokine , PBMC subset ( naïve v memory T cell , TREGS , etc . ) , polyclonal T cell activation potential . Aim 2 . Test effect RAPA treatment responsiveness vaccine challenge ; B cell ( antibody ) T cell response assess . Aim 3 . Correlate immune function rejuvenation cognitive physical function measure subject treat RAPA placebo . Cognition assess three different test tool ( EXIT25 , SLUMS , TAPS ) . Physical performance measure grip strength 40 foot time walk , parameter know correlate healthy age . In addition score positive outcome , investigator assess whether adverse change clinical laboratory test could compromise safe use RAPA therapeutically old individual . The long-term goal ass whether RAPA safe use elderly population , also efficacious slowing , even reverse , age process .</detailed_description>
