	<brief_summary>The study examine moderate hypofractionation regimen proton beam therapy high risk unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer . The prostate seminal vesicle treat 6750 centigray ( RBE ) 25 fraction ( i.e . 270 centigray/fraction ) , regional pelvic node receive 4500 centigray ( RBE ) 25 fraction ( i.e . 180 centigray/fraction ) simultaneously . The overall treatment time 5 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Hypofractionation Proton Beam Therapy With Concurrent Treatment Prostate Pelvic Nodes Clinically Localized , High Risk Unfavorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton beam therapy provide therapeutic gain offering least equivalent ( superior ) tumor control reduce risk radiation toxicity , comparison conventional photon-based external beam radiotherapy , give dose-deposition characteristic . Currently clinical target volume proton beam treatment prostate cancer mostly limited prostate seminal vesicle . There study proton beam therapy treat primary tumor prostate regional pelvic node simultaneously use moderate hypofractionation regimen . The study prospective , single-arm , clinical trial evaluate moderate hypofractionation regimen proton beam therapy high risk unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer . The clinical target volume proton beam therapy include prostate/seminal vesicle regional pelvic node . The primary objective ass late grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal ( GI ) genitourinary ( GU ) toxicity . The secondary objective evaluate late grade ≥ 2 GI GU toxicity , acute grade ≥ 3 GI GU toxicity , disease-free survival include freedom PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) relapse 5 year . The study provide avenue examine safety , efficacy , cost effectiveness , convenience moderate hypofractionation regimen ( 5-week course ) proton beam therapy .</detailed_description>
