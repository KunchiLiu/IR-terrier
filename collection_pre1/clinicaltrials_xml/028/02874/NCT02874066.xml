	<brief_title>PrOD Non-Cirrhotic Patients With HCV-1b Receiving Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection remain major co-morbidity hemodialysis patient . The incidence prevalence rate HCV infection hemodialysis patient much high general population , attribute high rate nosocomial HCV transmission . With regard HCV genotype distribution , HCV genotype 1 ( GT-1 ) infection prevalent type infection worldwide genotype distribution HCV-infected individual receive hemodialysis ( HD ) similar observe HCV-infected individual normal renal function.Compared non-HCV infected hemodialysis patient , HCV-infected patient increase risk liver-related morbidity mortality.10 Although HCV-infected hemodialysis patient receive renal transplantation survival advantage remain maintenance dialysis , patient still poor patient graft survival , well poor response interferon ( IFN ) -based therapy . In contrast , hemodialysis patient eradicate HCV infection improve biochemical , virologic histologic response , whether maintenance dialysis renal transplantation . Clinical experience IFN-based Therapy Approximately one third hemodialysis patient chronic HCV infection achieve sustain virological response ( SVR ) conventional IFN peginterferon monotherapy . In addition 18-30 % patient receive IFN-based monotherapy prematurely discontinue treatment due adverse event ( AEs ) . Although addition ribavirin IFN improve SVR rate HCV-infected patient normal renal function , ribavirin consider contraindicated treat HCV-infected hemodialysis patient concern life-threatening hemolytic anemia . Recently , pilot study indicate feasibility add low-dose ribavirin ( 200 mg three time per week daily 400 mg , adjust achieve target concentration 10-15 μmol/L ) , IFN treatment HCV-infected hemodialysis patient . Generally , SVR rate premature discontinuation rate due null-response , severe anemia , and/or heart failure combination therapy 56 % 22 % , respectively.Based small-scale study , low-dose ribavirin ( daily 200 mg ) approve August 2011 U.S. Food Drug Administration treat HCV-infected hemodialysis patients.Two recent well-conducted randomize control study compare efficacy safety combination therapy peginterferon alfa-2a ( 135 μg/week ) plus low-dose ribavirin ( RBV ) ( 200 mg/day ) monotherapy peginterferon ( 135 μg/week ) 48 24 week treatment-naïve HCV GT-1 GT-2 infected individual receive hemodialysis show SVR rate combination therapy group great monotherapy group ( 64 % versus 34 % , p &lt; 0.001 HCV GT-1 ; 74 % versus 44 % , p &lt; 0.001 HCV GT-2 ) , respectively . Although SVR rate combination therapy peginterferon plus low-dose ribavirin high peginterferon monotherapy . About 70-75 % patient experience clinically significant anemia need high dose erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) keep hemoglobin level within safety range . Although telaprevir ( TVR ) -based triple therapy use treat 4 HCV-1 patient receive hemodialysis responsive prior peginterferon plus RBV good efficacy , add on-treatment adverse event ( AEs ) pill burden preclude widespread use agent . Clinical experience IFN-free therapy ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir HCV GT-1 patient The recent introduction IFN-free direct act antiviral agent ( DAAs ) make paradigm shift regard medical treatment HCV-infected individual , base excellent efficacy safety ordinary patient . Among various IFN-free DAA regimen , treatment ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir ( PrOD ) approve 2014 treat patient chronic HCV GT-1 infection . Treatment PrOD plus weight-based ribavirin 12 week achieve SVR12 rate 96.2 % 96.3 % treatment-naïve treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic HCV GT-1 patient , respectively ( SAPPHIRE-I SAPPHIRE-II ) . Furthermore , SVR12 rate GT-1a GT-1b 95.3 % 98.0 % treatment-naïve patent , 96.0 % 96.7 % treatment-experienced patient , respectively . Among treatment-experienced HCV-1 patient , SVR rate PrOD plus RBV comparable various prior treatment response peginterferon plus RBV ( relapse : 95.3 % ; partial response : 100 % , null response : 95.2 % ) .36 Among treatment-naïve treatment-experienced compensate cirrhotic HCV GT-1 patient , treatment PrOD plus RBV 12 24 week achieve SVR rate 91.8 % 95. % , respectively ( TURQUOISE-II ) .37 The SVR12 rate HCV GT-1b cirrhotic patient similar receive 12 24 week treatment ( 98.5 % versus 100 % ) ; SVR12 rate HCV GT-1a cirrhotic patient receive 24 week treatment great receive 12 week treatment ( 94.2 % versus 88.6 % ) , particularly prior non-responders peginterferon plus RBV ( 92.9 % versus 80 % ) . The PEARL-III PEARL-IV study compare SVR12 rate treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic HCV GT-1b HCV GT-1a patient receive PrOD with/without RBV 12 weeks.37 The SVR12 rate PrOD without RBV similar PrOD RBV HCV GT-1b patient ( 99.0 % versus 99.5 % ) . However , SVR12 rate HCV GT-1a patient receive PrOD RBV marginally high receive PrOD without RBV ( 97.0 % versus 90.2 % ) . The PEARL-II study confirm treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic HCV GT-1b patient , treatment PrOD without RBV 12 week comparable SVR12 rate PrOD RBV therapy ( 100 % versus 96.6 % ) . In TURQUOISE-III study , PrOD without RBV 12 week achieve SVR12 rate 100 % treatment-naïve treatment-experienced compensate cirrhotic HCV GT-1b patient . With regard safety , PrOD with/without RBV show excellent safety profile patient experience serious adverse event ( SAEs ) prematurely treatment discontinuation . The constitutional AEs patient receive PrOD base treatment show slightly high receive placebo . Furthermore , symptoms mild grade . About 5 % non-cirrhotic patient 8 % cirrhotic patient receive PrOD plus RBV on-treatment hemoglobin level &lt; 10 g/dL ; none non-cirrhotic patient 2 % compensate cirrhotic patient receive PrOD on-treatment hemoglobin level &lt; 10 g/dL , respectively.35-40 In addition , on-treatment AST/ALT elevation 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) 0.6 % -1.7 % 0.5 % non-cirrhotic patient receive PrOD without RBV ; 2.9 % 2.0 % compensate cirrhotic patient receive PrOD without RBV , respectively . The on-treatment total bilirubin elevation 3 time ULN 2.4 % -5.7 % 0.5 % non-cirrhotic patient receive PrOD without RBV ; 13.5 % 0 % compensate cirrhotic patient receive PrOD without RBV , respectively.35-40 Based evidence , treatment PrOD 12 week recommend treatment-naïve treatment-experienced HCV GT-1b patient , regardless cirrhosis . Treatment PrOD plus RBV 12 week recommend HCV GT-1a patient , except compensate cirrhotic HCV GT-1a null responder prior therapy treatment PrOD plus RBV 24 week recommend . Clinical experience IFN-free therapy ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir HCV GT-1 patient severe renal impairment end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study ombitasvir , paritaprevir , ritonavir , dasabuvir evaluate 24 subject normal renal function , mild , moderate severe renal impairment ( arm 6 patient ) . Compared subject normal renal function , area curve ( AUCs ) subject mild renal impairment comparable ombitasvir , 20 % high paritaprevir dasabuvir , 42 % high ritonavir ; AUCs subject moderate renal impairment comparable ombitasvir , 37 % high paritaprevir dasabuvir , 80 % high ritonavir ; AUCs subject severe renal impairment comparable ombitasvir , 50 % high paritaprevir dasabuvir , 114 % high ritonavir . All patient well tolerated PrOD treatment except mild AEs , include nausea , myalgia , catheter-site erythema , encounter 1 subject moderate renal impairment . Based PK study , change drug exposure clinically relevant dos PrOD require adjustment . The phase 3b RUBY-I study evaluate safety efficacy PrOD RBV PrOD without RBV 12 week 13 7 HCV GT-1a HCV GT-1b treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patient severe renal impairment ESRD . The interim safety analysis show patient study drug discontinuation , treatment-related serious adverse event ( SAEs ) clinically significant change marker liver kidney function . With regard efficacy , 14 20 patient complete 12 week treatment achieve end-of-treatment virologic response ( EOTVR ) . Ten patient ( 8 GT-1a 2 GT-1b ) complete post-treatment follow-up 4 week achieve SVR4 . Furthermore , 2 HCV GT-1a patient complete post-treatment follow-up 12 week achieve SVR12 . Rationale study design Although peginterferon monotherapy combination therapy peginterferon plus low-dose RBV 24-48 week evaluate many study , efficacy treatment regimens modest ( SVR rate 60 % ) . In addition , on-treatment AEs SAEs IFN-based therapy frequently encounter HCV-infected patient receive hemodialysis . Of note pronounce on-treatment hemoglobin level decrease patient receive combination therapy peginterferon plus low-dose RBV , necessitate significant RBV dose reduction high-dose erythrocyte stimulating agent ( ESA ) support . By receive IFN-free DAA therapy , HCV-infected patient excellent SVR rate , low on-treatment SAE AE rate , short treatment duration , low pill burden . The PK study ombitasvir , paritaprevir , ritonavir dasabuvir prof excellent safety profile dose adjustment need PrOD regimen subject various degree renal impairment . The interim analysis RUBY-I study show excellent on-treatment off-therapy antiviral effect HCV GT-1a GT-1b infect patient receive PrOD plus low-dose RBV PrOD , respectively . However , patient enrol RUBY-I study treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic . Furthermore , 7 patient RUBY-I study HCV GT-1b patient . Based excellent safety efficacy profile PrOD treatment HCV GT-1b infect patient normal renal function , aim evaluate safety efficacy PrOD 12 week treatment-naïve treatment-experienced HCV GT-1b non-cirrhotic patient receive hemodialysis .</detailed_description>
