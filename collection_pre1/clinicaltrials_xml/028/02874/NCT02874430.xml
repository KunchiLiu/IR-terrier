	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well metformin hydrochloride work together doxycycline treat patient localize breast uterine cancer . Metformin hydrochloride may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Doxycycline may stop growth bacteria keep make protein minimize toxic side effect anti-cancer therapy . It yet know whether give metformin hydrochloride together doxycycline may better way treat patient localize breast uterine cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment combination metformin hydrochloride ( metformin ) doxycycline increase percentage cell express caveolin-1 cancer associate fibroblast patient breast uterine cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect metformin doxycycline treatment percentage cell express monocarboxylate transporter ( MCT ) 4 cancer associate fibroblast MCT1 transporter outer mitochondrial membrane ( TOMM ) 20 cancer cell breast uterine cancer patient . II . To assess safety tolerability metformin doxycycline treatment subject breast uterine cancer . III . To determine relationship percentage stromal cell express caveolin ( CAV ) 1 MCT4 tumor cell express MCT1 TOMM20 baseline treatment metformin doxycycline percentage cell express estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) breast uterine sample human epidermal growth factor ( HER ) 2 breast cancer sample . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect combine metformin doxycycline therapy metabolic profile cancer cell stroma use mass spectroscopy imaging ( MSI ) pair sample , compare metabolite profile pre-metformin post-metformin tumor sample . II . To assess impact patient 's nutritional status , estimate use 3-day dietary recall versus caloric need calculate Harris-Benedict equation baseline net change CAV1 . III . To assess effect combine metformin doxycycline therapy oncomiR micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( miR-21 ) intervention . IV . To assess effect combine metformin doxycycline therapy adipokines insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1/insulin signal pathway assessment serum triglyceride , IGF-1 , IGF-binding protein ( BP ) 3 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , adiponectin , leptin , IGF-1 receptor ( R ) , exosome evaluation , metabolomics profile , microRNA expression profile .</detailed_description>
