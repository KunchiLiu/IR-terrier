	<detailed_description>Effective treatment patient degenerative spinocerebellar ataxia scarce . It recently show intensive coordinative training base either physiotherapy exergames ( = whole-body control videogames ; might improve degenerative ataxia , effectiveness still dispute . This situation even complicate degenerative ataxia subject advance disease stage high multisystemic disease load . Here , underlie neurodegeneration progress many irreversible state include many additional extra-cerebellar system , make functional plasticity therapeutic success much less likely . Moreover , intervention outcome assessment subject unable walk freely delicate . Correspondingly , nonambulatory ataxia subject advance disease stage currently often exclude treatment trial , thus leave without prospect access novel treatment . The investigator hypothesize exergame training might offer novel treatment approach even largely nonambulatory subject multisystemic degenerative spinocerebellar ataxia . Using rater-blinded , intraindividual control study design , investigator show individualized exergame training strategy , tailor individual ' disease stage , improve postural control ataxia-specific control function even advance disease .</detailed_description>
