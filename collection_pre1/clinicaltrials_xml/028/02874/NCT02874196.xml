	<brief_summary>The purpose determine diagnostic performance flat panel dual energy arthrography arthro-tomosynthesis identification loosen painful hip prosthesis , take reference result surgery performed 6 month arthrography . Secondary purpose : - To describe level concordance technique indication surgery - To study inter-technique concordance kappa coefficient - To study relationship density differential 2 acquisition grey level subtraction , i.e . subtraction quality accord metal</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prosthesis Loosening Imaging With Dual Energy Tomosynthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip arthroplasty become one performed orthopedic procedure . Actual average lifetime total hip prosthesis approximately 15 year . Some complication inevitable . Total hip prosthesis imaging , perform search complication wear , difficult depend many technique . Subtracted arthrography good technique access limit need angiography room . In study patient undergo standard arthrography , dual energy arthrography , arthro-tomosynthesis arthro-tomography .</detailed_description>
