	<brief_summary>Whole-body periodic acceleration ( WBPA ) new , non-invasive , promising therapy diverse grow list disorder include cardiovascular disease . During WBPA , patient lie supine position bed capable translate back forth parallel ground , along head-to-foot axis patient . Thus , treatment best described form `` passive exercise . '' The frequency translation ( 180 cycles/minute ; cpm ) well distance travel ( 2-24mm ) bed adjust patient health care professional . The science behind therapeutic effect WBPA still remain largely unknown . We observe WBPA may impact sleep activity individual PD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance common individual PD . Whole-body periodic acceleration ( WBPA ) new , non-invasive , promising therapy diverse grow list disorder . During WBPA , patient lie supine position bed capable translate back forth parallel ground , along head-to-foot axis patient . Thus , treatment best described form `` passive exercise . '' WBPA show previous study increase nitric oxide . Increased level nitric oxide show improve sleep pattern population . The current pilot study investigate WBPA impact upon sleep disturbance subject PD suffer abnormal sleep pattern . We record sleep pattern activity level use Jawbone U3Â® activity monitor .</detailed_description>
