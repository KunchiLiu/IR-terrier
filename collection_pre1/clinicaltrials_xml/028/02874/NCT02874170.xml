	<brief_summary>Drepanocytose disease first genetic disease world . It result synthesis abnormal hemoglobin ( HbS ) , deoxygenated form , polymerize lead structural change red blood cell ( RBC ) take shape sickle , become fragile , rigid less deformable . The fragility GR sickle cause mass destruction , lead chronic anemia ( i.e . low level GR blood ) associate low tissue oxygenation . More rigid less deformable , sickle GR tend hang microvessels , lead vaso-occlusive crisis ( CVO ) particularly painful , cause failure certain organ ( spleen , kidney , brain , lung , heart , liver , bone ... ) life-threatening patient . Preliminary study conduct patient drepanocytose disease ( HbSS ) demonstrate change muscle tissue indicate possible failure supply use oxygen . To date , translation metabolic remodel muscle work know . This project 's main objective evaluate muscle function drepanocytose attempted patient . We hypothesize muscle remodel associate sickle cell disease functional impact strength muscle metabolism . The main objective characterize maximal voluntary plantar flexor muscle . The criterion target base comparison healthy subject , carrier sickle cell trait ( HbAS ) sickle cell patient ( HbSS ) oxygen saturation . The strictly non-invasive approach propose project study functional parameter muscle sickle cell disease possible link clinical manifestation disease , include vaso-occlusive crisis , tissue oxygenation pH play major role .</brief_summary>
