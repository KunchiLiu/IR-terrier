	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis disease affect white matter central nervous system . In France , concern approximately 80 000 patient represent one frequent neurological affection young adult . There several symptom , include pyramidal syndrome , sensory syndrome , visual disorder , fatigue , bladder-sphincter disorder , etc . It unpredictable chronic disease . Most time , evolve relapse beginning , , year , disease becomes secondarily progressive . In case , evolution directly progressive . Efforts orient deconditioning people affected multiple sclerosis already proven , link disease . The decrease capacity produce effort aggravate neurovegetative cardiovascular disorder . The limitation , even complete stop , physical activity often link fear handicap aggravation . Causes stop multiple , include fatigue ( general muscular ) balance disorder , even handicap level low ( average EDSS = 2 ) . Walking disorder generate pathology frequent represent first symptom disease ( 10 20 % case ) . These walk disorder quickly appear alter significantly quality life . After several year evolution , functional effect pronounce . The walk perimeter estimate 500 meter without help 7 year evolution average , 100 meter 15 year evolution . At stage , 50 % patient need technical help move . Some reeducation program propose hospitalization efficiency functional capacity . It admit physical exercise noxious , allow implementation effort reeducation pathology . Randomized controlled study show multiple sclerosis patient improvement physical ability , O2max ( aerobic capacity ) , decrease fatigue improvement quality life . Actually , cyclo-ergometer common device use effort reeducation . Another approach use treadmill , base improvement walk reflex modeling enhancement specific walk work , thanks high frequency repetition . This device seem adapted improvement walk disorder cyclo-ergometer . For pathology , study estimate effect effort reeducation treadmill . Unfortunately , efficiency program walk endurance well know result controversial . Indeed , two randomize , control trial show improvement walk speed energy cost walking . However , impact 2-Minute Walk Test ( 2MWT ) contradictory , probably due population study ( different EDSS age ) training duration ( 4 week Vs 8 week ) . Moreover , study , effort intensity time determine arbitrary percentage theoretical maximal heart rate ( HR ) VO2max . The heart rate correspond level load ventilatory threshold ( VT ) describe Wasserman al ( 1973 ) could efficient measure intensity reeducation , compare heart rate ( HR ) determine arbitrary percentage . Four reason highlight : 1 . The ventilatory threshold represent well define metabolic level ( individualized measure ) 2 . According subject , ventilator threshold constant percentage `` O2max '' , suggest also individualized measure . 3 . During maximal cardiorespiratory effort test , ventilatory threshold 1 ( VT1 ) correspond great increase CO2 compare O2 . The identification threshold allow precise determination limit body incapable produce necessary energy realize effort use aerobic metabolism . 4 . The VT1 situate level load enough intensity subject support test without dyspnea . A VT1 low 40 % theoretical VO2 max consider marker maladjustment effort due dyspnea excessive muscular fatigue . This indication informative quality life patient .</detailed_description>
