	<criteria>Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 ( DSMV ) diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) otherwise specify ( NOS ) base semistructured review Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 ( DSMV ) criteria mental status examination well complete systematic patient interview utilize Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) Males females age 821 year . Subjects must take psychotropic drug affect glutamate neurotransmission ( riluzole , memantine , acamprosate , topiramate , amantadine , among others ) may interfere TMS record . If patient home psychostimulants medication hold day test . Subjects may take two psychotropic drug . Dosing concomitant psychotropic drug target core social and/or communication impairment must stable four week prior randomization . Dosing concomitant psychotropic drug target feature associate ASD ( insomnia , inattention , hyperactivity , anxiety , irritability among others ) must stable two week ( exception four week fluoxetine ) prior randomization . Stable seizure disorder ( seizures 6 month prior enrollment ; anticonvulsant dose &gt; 60 day ) Able participate neurophysiological test include Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) portion experiment base patient comfort examiner judgement Legal guardian provide write informed consent subject provide write informed assent . Expectation majority subject able assent potential young child and/or cognitively impaired able assent . Subjects exhibit significant disruptive , aggressive , selfinjurious , sexually inappropriate behavior eligible enrollment Presence current Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 ( DSMV ) psychiatric disorder may require alternative pharmacotherapy different treatment include psychotic disorder , major affective disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder , panic disorder , substance related disorder . Presence medical condition would make treatment methylphenidate ( MPH ) less safe . Subjects significant cardiac , hepatic , renal disease exclude due concern pharmacokinetic alteration adverse effect . Because unknown effect methylphenidate ( MPH ) develop human fetus , females childbearing potential give urine pregnancy test require use suitable form birth control study . A positive pregnancy test result excludes subject . Presence condition would make participant unable comply requirement study reason . Prohibited Concomitant Medications : Methylphenidate primarily excrete kidney know pharmacokinetic drug interaction . The following medication allow due potential pharmacodynamic interaction : monoamine oxidase inhibitor atomoxetine .</criteria>
