	<detailed_description>Aspiration pneumonia common mechanism recurrent mechanical ventilation episode intensive care patient lead long hospital admission , increase morbidity , mortality . When length mechanical ventilation prolong translaryngeal tube change tracheostomy tube . This practice several advantage : pressure damage vocal cord avoid , wean respirator facilitate , oral feeding make possible . Swallowing difficulty , many case depend pharyngeal upper esophageal dysfunction , show link aspiration pneumonia . Furthermore , previous study indicate swallow dysfunction frequent problem intensive care patient tracheostomy although report incidence varies markedly . Swallowing function intensive care patient tracheostomy routinely evaluate current diagnostic technique , speech pathology bedside assessment ( BSA ) , fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation swallowing ( FEES ) , Videofluoroscopy ( VF ) , laborious , subjective expertise-dependent method . Instead symptom report patient fluid food intake ( cough , chest pain ) allow guide feeding although know silent aspiration common cause aspiration pneumonia . To prevent leakage pharyngeal content trachea tracheostomy tube provide air-filled cuff . This cuff , inflate , exert pressure inner tracheal wall thereby seal trachea around tracheostomy tube . As security cuff often inflated intake fluid food although study indicate may deteriorate swallow function fact increase risk aspiration . Automated Impedance Manometry ( AIM ) analysis method combine measurement manometry ( pressure ) impedance ( flow ) use specialized equipment generate objective numerical value indicative different physiological process govern safe pharyngeal swallow . During swallow , measure quantify time bolus flow relative pharyngeal propulsion , mechanical resistance flow propulsion , overall pharyngeal contractility . Pressure-flow measure combine derive swallow risk index ( SRI ) provide global assessment swallow defines level swallow dysfunction may predispose risk aspiration . This objective assessment swallow function potential provide timely target treatment option . It easily conduct bedside minimal disruption ongoing medical treatment , carry negligible risk patient . Measures derive use high resolution impedance manometry ( HRIM ) system ( Sierra Scientific Instruments , Inc. , Los Angeles , California , USA ) . The system employ solid state catheter 4.2 mm outer diameter incorporate 36 circumferential 1 cm-spaced pressure sensor 18 2-cm long impedance segment place transnasally sensor straddle entire pharyngo- esophageal segment . Data recording do several bolus swallow analyse afterwards use AIM analysis . Twenty intensive care patient ten healthy volunteer include study . After researcher describe study , participant consent , ask complete brief questionnaire swallow function . During study , participant sit comfortably bed . The manometry catheter pass one nostril esophagus , stop top stomach . Once satisfactorily place , participant ask swallow 4 x 5 ml ; 4 x 10 ml , 3 x 20 ml slightly salty water 4 x 10 ml semisolid jelly . If first inflate tracheostomy cuff deflate procedure repeat . Furthermore , part patient evaluate FEES simultaneously HRIM measurement . Once study complete , tube remove . Patients follow upp two month ICU discharge questionnaire swallow function also ask perform additional HRIM measurement . Volunteers perform similar swallow series patient one study occasion .</detailed_description>
