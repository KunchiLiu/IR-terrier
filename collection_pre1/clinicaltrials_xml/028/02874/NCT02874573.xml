	<brief_summary>This study Phase 1 clinical trial determine safety , tolerability , efficacy Tocilizumab ( Actemra ) adjunct antipsychotic medication stable outpatient schizophrenia . Tocilizumab ( structural formula C6428H9976N1720O2018S42 ) recombinant humanize anti-human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) receptor monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) subclass . Tocilizumab formulate concentrate solution infusion , administer intravenous infusion . The investigator propose 12-week randomized control trial tocilizumab , give adjunct antipsychotic , N=20 stable outpatient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder evidence increase inflammation peripheral blood ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] &gt; 0.5 mg/dL ) . The investigator hypothesize adjunctive treatment tocilizumab associate significant improvement cognition compare placebo patient schizophrenia , baseline IL-6 level higher tocilizumab-treated responder versus non-responders , great decrease hsCRP baseline week 12 tocilizumab-versus placebo-treated responder , response define â‰¥0.5 standard deviation ( SD ) improvement cognition . Tocilizumab administer intravenous infusion every 4 week . Following screen evaluation , participant receive three infusion siltuximab , one baseline , another week 4 study , another week 8 . The investigator measure change cognitive function symptom 12-week period . Complementing previous positive clinical trial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , would `` proof-of-concept '' study target specific cytokine viable treatment schizophrenia . Interleukin 6 receptor discover clone Osaka University , Japan , Tadamitsu Kishimoto 1980s . In 1997 , Chugai Pharmaceuticals begin clinical development tocilizumab treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Clinical study Castleman 's disease systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis start 2001 2002 , respectively . Hoffmann-La Roche co-developed drug due license agreement 2003 . On 11 January 2010 , Tocilizumab approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) Actemra treatment rheumatoid arthritis . The FDA approve tocilizumab treatment systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis child two year age April 2011 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pathophysiological role inflammation schizophrenia one endure finding field . Recently , increase understanding complex interaction inflammation brain chronic disease well inform relationship schizophrenia . Several trial find treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , adjunct antipsychotic , associate significant improvement psychopathology schizophrenia . Cytokines key regulator inflammation exert effect periphery brain . Serum cytokine level predict response two study , another study find trend improve cognition adjunctive NSAID treatment.1 These finding provide important empirical support pathophysiological role inflammation patient schizophrenia . Two important limitation trial : ) agent investigate relevant off-target ( i.e. , non-immune ) effect , b ) evidence inflammation peripheral blood inclusion criterion , may decrease signal-to-noise ratio . Schizophrenia associate impaired cognition , persist despite current treatment , important determinant quality life overall function . Converging line evidence suggest interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) promise therapeutic target cognitive impairment schizophrenia . IL-6 cytokine produce peripheral blood leukocyte , central nervous system ( CNS ) microglia astrocyte . The IL-6 gene risk factor schizophrenia may impact serum IL-6 level . Blood ( cerebrospinal fluid ) CSF IL-6 level alter schizophrenia . IL-6 level associate psychopathology3 cognition schizophrenia . In population outside schizophrenia , high serum IL-6 level associate poor cognition . In first-episode chronic schizophrenia , IL-6 level significant predictor small leave hippocampal volume . Along previous work , preliminary study provide strong evidence IL-6 novel therapeutic target cognitive impairment schizophrenia , demonstrate feasibility propose trial . Briefly , 64 patient schizophrenia , find high blood IL-6 level significant predictor great impairment Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ( BACS ) control multiple potential confounding factors.5 In 8-week open-label trial 6 subject , tocilizumab ( humanize monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor , approve US FDA 2010 treatment adult moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) inadequate response one tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -antagonist therapy , administer intravenous infusion every 4 week ) , give adjunct antipsychotic , well tolerate associate significant improvement BACS verbal fluency 4 week , BACS digit symbol cod 2 , 4 , 8 week , BACS composite score 4 8 weeks.10 In first year follow submission , one clinical trial plan . The investigator conduct 12-week randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine safety , tolerability , efficacy tocilizumab adjunct antipsychotic medication 20 stable outpatient schizophrenia . In previous trial Tocilizumab , clinically significant adverse drug reaction occur . The risk find people rheumatoid arthritis know , may unknown risk use schizophrenia . Clinically significant adverse drug reaction include anaphylaxis ( 0.4 % ) , infection ( 0.1-7.8 % ) , intestinal perforation , neutropenia ( 7.0 % ) , cardiac failure . Known side effect tocilizumab common include : increase hepatic enzyme ( AST , ALT ) , hypertension , headache , neutropenia , infusion-related reaction , upper respiratory tract infection , nasopharyngitis . Subjects schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder access outpatient psychiatry clinic Augusta University satellite collaborative site . The study 6 visit : screening , baseline , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Subjects randomize equally either tocilizumab ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) , adjunct current antipsychotic psychotropic medication . Tocilizumab obtain manufacturer , Genentech , hospital pharmacy per previous trial . Subjects tocilizumab group receive 4 mg/kg infusion baseline , week 4 8 , per recommend start dose rheumatoid arthritis . Subjects placebo group receive infusion normal saline ( packaging volume tocilizumab group ) baseline , week 4 8 . We contact subject phone day 1 7 infusion ass infusion-related event . We assess cognition psychopathology baseline , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . We also measure multiplex panel blood cytokine ( include IL-6 ) baseline , week 2m 4 , 8 , 12 . Patients withdrawn meet exclusion criterion time point .</detailed_description>
