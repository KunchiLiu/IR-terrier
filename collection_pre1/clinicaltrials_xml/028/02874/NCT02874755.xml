	<brief_title>Quality Tuberculosis Care Mumbai , India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By take advantage randomize roll-out design PPIA program Mumbai , evaluation aim determine causal effect program quality care among private sector health provider . The evaluation embed exist quality care surveillance project use standardized patient assess quality tuberculosis ( TB ) care Mumbai , India . Below description ( 1 ) TB intervention implement PPIA , ( 2 ) quality TB care ( QuTUB ) surveillance project , ( 3 ) randomize roll-out PPIA program among subset provider order isolate impact program quality care . The entire program implementation external researcher . To good understand impact program use already approve surveillance study , researcher use stepped-wedge design involve sequential roll-out program subset provider period time order roll-out randomize . 1 . PPIA intervention : Between January 2014 December 2016 , pilot PPIA program independently implement non-governmental organization PATH ( Program Appropriate Technology Health known formerly ) Mumbai city . In role PPIA Mumbai , PATH 's aim strengthen exist effort control TB engagement private health sector . Through network , objective facilitate early accurate diagnosis proper notification case ensure appropriate treatment treatment adherence completion among TB patient private sector . In order achieve objective , PPIA initiate expanded private sector network base hub-and-spoke model . Hubs generally private health facility ( `` hub '' MD Chest Physician access pharmacy digital X-ray laboratory ) private clinic MD MD Chest Physicians . Spokes generally doctor Bachelor Medicine , Bachelor Surgery ( MBBS ) degree , practitioner alternative medicine ( AYUSH practitioner train Ayurveda , Yoga Naturopathy , Unani , Siddha , Homeopathy ) , informal provider minimum qualification . The PPIA network also include chemists/pharmacists diagnostic laboratory . The pilot Mumbai serve model private health sector involvement national TB control use inform similar program nearby urban Indian setting . 2 . Quality care surveillance : The QuTUB project part PPIA monitoring effort run parallel program ' scale expansion . The objective QuTUB project capture level quality care standardize patient ( `` mystery shopper '' `` fake patient '' ) , individual recruit locally train portray four different TB case . Developed Technical Advisory Group benchmarked Standards TB Care India , case design reflect different stage TB disease progression , previous interaction health system upon presentation health care provider . Outcomes captured standardized patient exit questionnaire give within 2 hour interaction provider ` include : history question ask provider , laboratory test order , medicine dispense prescribe , referral make . 3 . Randomized roll-out evaluation approach : In January 2015 , PATH interest try understand causal impact program diagnostic process , opportunity remove selection bias attribute difference quality care solely program taking advantage randomize roll-out expansion plan PPIA program among subset provider . In collaboration PPIA Mumbai team , study take intention-to-treat instrumental variable evaluation approach selective enrollment subset provider second round program scale-up Mumbai city . The researcher note subset provider purposively select early round enrollment therefore may see few TB patient , reluctant enroll program first round program expansion . Therefore , impact program group may different among enrolled previously . Under approach , agree evaluation eligible AYUSH practitioner would network two purposively select high TB burden high slum population ward Mumbai . For , researcher provide PATH list 300 randomly select practitioner among already network program . AYUSH practitioner list randomly allocate two group : one group ( treatment ) 150 eligible AYUSH would sensitize networked , group ( control ) 150 eligible AYUSH would approach networking year , QuTUB study team able complete end-line data collection 2016 . Selection program roll-out group randomize . Standardized patient send group intervention baseline measure quality care , standardized patient would return control group begin receive intervention end-line measure . The entire intervention Mumbai implement PPIA separate team implement quality care surveillance evaluation . Care take ensure evaluation team field independently implementation . Analysis : Intention-to-treat analysis instrumental variable conduct determine ( ) treatment assignment serve good instrument : strong correlation actual enrollment statuses provider regardless treatment assignment , uncorrelated outcome , connect outcome actual enrollment program , ( ii ) balance baseline treatment control group .</detailed_description>
