	<brief_summary>Background : People cancer often make complex decision treatment . For decision , weigh benefit treatment side effect . They may think potential increase risk another disease . One example hormone replacement therapy . That reduce woman risk get colorectal cancer , raise risk get breast cancer . Researchers want learn people make tradeoff decision like . Objective : To learn people respond information hypothetical health medical treatment option . Eligibility : Adults age 18 70 . Design : Participants one 30-minute visit . Participants complete series short questionnaire . These belief value . Some may cancer heart disease risk . Participants age 18 29 answer question sexual health . Participants write paragraph two room house life event . Participants read series story . These describe different hypothetical health treatment . The story describe pill lower risk one health condition , raise risk another . After story , participant note willing take pill . Participants answer question information get . They also answer question health , belief , opinion . Participants 2 attention task computer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Emotions Regulatory Focus Decision Making That Involves Risk Tradeoffs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given many preventive therapeutic treatment cancer low risk one disease , increase risk another disease ( substantial side effect ) , patient doctor often must make medical decision involve tradeoff . When faced tradeoff , people make decision base factor beyond objective probability estimate . Emotions regulatory focus know influence judgment risk propensity non-tradeoff decision-making context , little known independent joint effect decision make tradeoff scenario option involve degree risk . This study aim generate fundamental knowledge individual make decision context tradeoff , whether individual clinical disorder risk clinical disorder differ healthy individual decision making . This immediate translational potential apply study decision making among cancer patient increase risk cancer . We plan examine effect discrete incidental affect tradeoff decision making , role regulatory focus moderator effect . During visit laboratory University Pittsburgh , human subject age 18 70 randomly assign write emotional event ( something make angry afraid depending study condition ) room house ( neutral emotion condition ) . Then , read series scenario describe pill lower risk one health condition , raise risk another . After , indicate willingness take pill . Regulatory focus , risk perception , implicit measure risk propensity anticipate emotion also assess . Drawing previous research , hypothesize participant ask recall angry experience willing take pill , effect particularly strong promotion-oriented regulatory focus . Prevention-focused participant ask recall experience make feel afraid expect least willing take pill . We also explore possible mechanism underlie emotion induction effect pill choice , shift risk perception , bias attentional focus , implicitly measure anticipated emotion .</detailed_description>
