	<brief_summary>The imdazoline2 bind site ( I2BS ) know reside inside astrocyte . Changes number I2BS post mortem tissue implicate range psychiatric condition depression addiction , along neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's disease Huntington 's chorea . Preclinical study also demonstrate functional interaction opioid system , I2BS ligands show affect tolerance morphine alleviate morphine withdrawal syndrome rat . Recently I2BS I2BS ligands show interesting analgesic effect different model pain . The location I2BS astrocytic glial cell possibility may way regulate glial fibrillary acidic protein lead increased interest role I2BS I2BS ligands condition characterise marked gliosis . The number I2BS show increase Alzheimer 's disease post mortem , also suggest I2BS may marker severity malignancy human glioblastoma . The lack suitable imaging tool I2BS meant information regard number distribution I2BS brain come preclinical specie vitro post-mortem study . The recent development [ 11C ] BU99008 suitable PET ligand quantify I2BS vivo , enable direct quantification I2BS availability regional distribution live human brain . In study investigator plan utilise [ 11C ] BU99008 quantify regional brain availability I2BS human brain vivo use PET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>I2PETPG - Imidazoline2 Binding Sites Group Participants Diagnosed With AD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) ( 8 ) receive two PET/CT scan 11C‐BU99008 , tracer alone tracer scan follow administration idazoxan . In addition , participant receive structural MRI enable anatomical registration PET data . These enable determination number regional location I2BS brain condition . These data compare find healthy human brain . In order realise , 11C‐BU99008 scan alone conjunction mixed I2BS/α2‐adrenoceptor drug idazoxan use . There evidence I2BS age related increase density . In order confident change regional density distribution I2BS see due disease merely age AD participant age match healthy participant . Potential participant pass initial telephone screen invite screen visit eligibility take part study determine informed consent take . This Imperial CRF Imanova Ltd . The screening consist interview study discuss explain . The participant ' understanding procedure , requirement commitment confirm question answer informed consent take . In addition interview participant personal detail demographic record psychiatric medical history take well follow : - Semi-structured interviews/questionnaires complete : Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 ( MINI 5 ) , Cognitive diagnostic test dementia ( CAMCOG ) - A medical examination blood take clinical laboratory test . - A structural MRI . - Review medical history current state health , include question psychiatric symptom use prescription non-prescription drug , well use illegal drug alcohol . - Physical examination measurement blood pressure heart rate , ECG . - Collecting urine sample check presence drug . - Alcohol breath test . - An `` Allen 's Test '' perform check blood supply hand . - Other questionnaire : Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Eysenck personality ( revise ) ( EPQ-R25 ) , Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , MRI safety Participants eligible invited take part study . The schedule detail preferred scenario , however may necessary perform MRI PET/CT scan separate day due consideration logistics participant convenience . If reason necessary cancel suspend scan due technical reason ( e.g . radioligand production failure , scanner failure , etc . ) , participant ask return another day repeat scan/day . This happen radioligand administer particular scan time study suspend . This mean participant day scan take place may different . Each participant receive two PET/CT scan one MRI : - Scanning Day ; Morning ( Day 1 ) - structural MRI scan baseline PET/CT scan 11C‐BU99008 alone determine total number binding site ( total , PET signal ) . - Scanning Day ; Afternoon ( Day 2 ) - block PET/CT scan 11C‐BU99008 combination single dose idazoxan ( I2BS block ) The combination two scan allow dissection regional contribution I2BS 11C‐BU99008 specific signal , order get accurate determination regional I2BS density . Scanning day - The participant arrive Imanova 's scan facility Burlington Danes Building , Hammersmith Hospital early morning . The exact time determine logistical constraint production 11C‐BU99008 . On arrival , participant ask agree carry participate study general health compliance study specific restriction assess interview , urine drug abuse screen breathalyser ( alcohol ) . Once confirm eligible proceed , undergo procedure . The participant give structural MRI scan cannulate radial artery venous cannula insert forearm cubital vein . The arterial cannula require collection arterial blood sample throughout scan , measure concentration tracer arterial plasma quantitative analysis PET signal . A venous cannula require administration 11C‐BU99008 . Baseline subjective ( e.g . Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory ( SSAI ) visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ) objective measure ( e.g . heart rate ( HR ) blood pressure ( BP ) ) take prepared position scanner PET/CT scan 1 . The scan 120 min length , time HR BP monitor . At end scan , participant remove another set subjective objective measure take . They give acute dose idazoxan ( 80 mg ; p.o . ) 120 min start PET/CT scan 2 another round subjective objective measure arterial blood sample take PET/CT scan 1 . At end last PET/CT scan day , participant remove scanner , indwell cannulae remove , final round subjective objective measure record , fitness send home assess attend clinician . If participant scan separate day , assessment fitness send home occur day scan . When fit leave send home taxi .</detailed_description>
