	<brief_summary>In study , investigator plan test two potential mechanism contribute diastolic dysfunction among asymptomatic person HIV cART . The first propose mechanism heighten systemic immune activation/inflammation HIV contribute myocardial inflammation , turn promote myocardial fibrosis . The second mechanism ectopic fat deposition ( increased visceral adiposity ) HIV relate increase intramyocardial lipid content , turn contribute diastolic dysfunction . Both HIV positive HIV-negative participant undergo cardiac MRI/ MRS image study evaluation myocardial fibrosis , myocardial inflammation , intramyocardial lipid content . Traditional marker CVD risk , inflammatory markers/immune , hormonal marker , marker myocardial stretch/injury assess relation cardiac MRI/MRS outcome .</brief_summary>
