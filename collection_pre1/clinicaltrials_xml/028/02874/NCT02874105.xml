	<brief_title>Glenohumeral Re-centering During Closed Kinetic Chain Shoulder Physiotherapy . A Prospective Randomized Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder impingement account 44 65 % shoulder complaint physician visit . Shoulder impingement classify two main category : structural functional . The structural impingement cause narrowing subacromial space result reduction space due bony growth soft-tissue inflammation . The functional impingement superior migration humeral head cause weakness and/or muscle imbalance . It possible subacromial impingement result combination structural functional factor . Subacromial impingement occur structure SAS ( rotator cuff , biceps tendon long head , subacromial bursa ) become compress inflamed coracoacromial ligament . The suprasinatus tendon particular high risk irritation subsequent injury likely contact acromion humerus abduct 90° internally rotate 45° . The clinical impairment always vary painful shoulder correct range motion pseudoparalysis shoulder . The first treatment subacromial impingement always non surgical consists relative resting , painkiller and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAD ) physiotherapy . The aim treatment relieve pain restore mobility good function shoulder . There consensus physiotherapy protocol treatment shoulder impingement . In France , use physiotherapy protocol use strengthen muscle stabilize scapula ( rhomboide muscle , trapezius serratus anterior ) low humerus ( pectoralis major , latissimus dorsi teres major ) .

The assessor outcomes blind intervention . The rhythm physiotherapy session group ( 3 session per week 3 week , 2 session per week 3 week 1 session per week 5 week ) . All patient receive passive mobilization shoulder without pain muscle stretch . Each physiotherapy session last 30 minute include massage hot physiotherapy case VAS ( visual analogic scale ) pain superior 6/10 .</detailed_description>
