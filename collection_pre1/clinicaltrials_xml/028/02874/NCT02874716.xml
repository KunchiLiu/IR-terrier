	<brief_title>Quality Tuberculosis Care Urban Patna , India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By take advantage randomize roll-out design PPIA program urban Patna , evaluation aim determine causal effect program quality health care among private sector health provider . The evaluation embed exist quality care surveillance project use standardized patient assess quality tuberculosis ( TB ) care urban Patna . Below description ( 1 ) TB intervention implement PPIA , ( 2 ) quality TB care ( QuTUB ) surveillance project , ( 3 ) randomize roll-out PPIA program among subset provider order isolate impact program quality care . The entire program implementation external researcher . To good understand impact program use already approve design , researcher use stepped-wedge design involve sequential roll program subset provider period time order roll-out randomize . 1 . PPIA intervention : Between January 2014 December 2016 , pilot PPIA program independently implement non-governmental organization World Health Partners ( WHP ) urban Patna . In role PPIA Patna , WHP 's aim strengthen exist effort control TB engagement private health sector . Through network , objective facilitate early accurate diagnosis proper notification case ensure appropriate treatment treatment adherence completion among TB patient private sector . This do establishing network engage four type private health sector actor vital importance TB advocacy treatment effort : ( ) formal provider , qualify doctor hospital , nurse home , outpatient clinic receive presumptive TB case treat TB case , ( ii ) informal provider , non-allopathic provider less fully qualified practitioner , include practitioner alternative medicine Ayurveda , Yoga Naturopathy , Unani , Siddha , Homeopathy practitioner minimum qualification , ( iii ) chemists/pharmacists drug license , medicine stock , anti-TB drug sale , ( iv ) diagnostic laboratory conduct sputum smear microscopy and/or chest X-rays , GeneXpert drug susceptibility test . The pilot serve model private health sector involvement national TB control use inform similar program urban Indian setting . 2 . Quality care surveillance : The QuTUB project part PPIA monitoring effort run parallel program scale expansion . The objective QuTUB project capture level quality care standardize patient ( `` mystery shopper '' `` fake patient '' ) , individual recruit locally train portray four different TB case . Developed Technical Advisory Group benchmarked Standards TB Care India , case design reflect different stage TB disease progression , previous interaction health system upon presentation health care provider . Outcomes captured standardized patient exit questionnaire give within 2 hour interaction provider include : history question ask provider , laboratory test order , medicine dispense prescribe , referral make . 3 . Randomized roll-out evaluation approach : In December 2014 , WHP interest try understand causal impact program diagnostic process , opportunity remove selection bias attribute difference quality care solely program taking advantage randomize roll-out expansion plan PPIA program among subset provider . In collaboration PPIA Patna team , study take intention-to-treat instrumental variable evaluation approach selective enrollment subset provider second round program scale-up across urban Patna . The researcher note subset provider purposively select early round enrollment therefore may see few TB patient , reluctant enroll program first round program expansion . Therefore , impact program group may different among enrolled previously . Under approach , agree evaluation eligible formal provider would engage . For , researcher provide WHP list 321 randomly select provider among already enrol beginning 2015 . Providers list randomly allocate two group : one group ( treatment ) 171 eligible formal provider would sensitize engaged , group ( control ) 150 eligible formal provider would engage QuTUB study team able complete end-line data collection 2016 , year . Selection program roll-out group randomize . The study group include formal provider would see pulmonary TB case self-reported low caseloads . Standardized patient send group intervention baseline measure quality care , standardized patient would return control group begin receive intervention end-line measure . The entire intervention Patna implement PPIA separate research team implement quality care surveillance evaluation . Care take ensure evaluation team field independently implementation . Analysis : Intention-to-treat analysis instrumental variable conduct determine ( ) treatment assignment serve good instrument : strong correlation actual enrollment statuses provider regardless treatment assignment , uncorrelated outcome , connect outcome actual enrollment program , ( ii ) balance baseline treatment control group .</detailed_description>
