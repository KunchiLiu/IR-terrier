	<brief_summary>People memory problem struggle everyday activity may stop thing want . They prone accident high risk fall . Occupational therapist advise daily activity easily safely . Physiotherapists teach exercise increase activity improve balance , may help maintain memory . There little research make intervention work people memory problem . The investigator develop two activity exercise program suitable people memory problem . The investigator study feasibility trial . One programme involve high-intensity supervision ( 50 visit one year ) , moderate-intensity supervision ( 11 visit three month ) . The investigator compare standard fall prevention assessment advice ( 1-3 therapist visit ) . The investigator encourage participant exercise family member year , programme end . People early dementia memory problem eligible study . If possible , investigator also recruit family member . Participants recruit memory clinic 'Join Dementia Research ' register . The intervention deliver maximum 1 year home . Researchers visit collect information baseline 12 month . The investigator measure ability activity daily live , activity , quality life , memory health service use . Participants complete weekly fall diary . Intervention persistence measure 24 month . The investigator conduct interview discussion group help develop programme , understand work practice ( 'process evaluation ' ) . The investigator also initial work health economic modelling , dissemination implementation . Study finding use refine intervention , inform plan definitive randomise control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This feasibility randomise control trial aim answer practicability feasibility question require ensure large scale trial successful . The specific question : 1 . Can investigator develop implement successful safe rehabilitation support worker ( RSW ) train programme ? 2 . Can investigators recruit participant sufficient rate across multiple site ? Will potential participant consent ? Do randomisation system work ? 3 . Can investigators deliver intervention across site ? Can investigators tailor intervention ? Do component work together ? 4 . Can intervention undertaken home ? 5 . Is intervention acceptable , tolerate adhere ? How many withdraw ? 6 . What level supervision intensity require main trial enable engagement level likely effective prevent fall ? Or whether , practice , level supervision match individual participant characteristic . 7 . What proportion continue adhere 24 month follow-up ? 8 . Are unexpected adverse consequence ? 9 . Can investigator collect trial health status fall data baseline follow-up ? Does blind work ? Is assessment schedule burdensome ? 10 . Are sample size assumption correct ? The feasibility trial act external pilot trial . The investigator choose randomise controlled trial design minimise researcher bias allocation group enable difference follow attribute therapy rather characteristics participant involve . A control arm include standard fall prevention , request NIHR . Participants either recruited Memory Clinics ( initial discussion study nurse doctor clinic ) , 'Join Dementia Research ' dementia research volunteer register . If patient interested take part research , researcher visit home convenient time , assess capacity consent ( The investigator recruit patient capacity give inform consent ) , ensure meet eligibility criterion take informed consent . The investigator collect information participant interview conduct home . Baseline assessment Those agree take part screen suitability baseline assessment undertaken home clinic setting . This include : 1. demographic contact detail , carer demographic contact detail 2 . Medical fall history , include previous fracture , recent hospitalisation , drug take 3. fall risk factor , include vision lie stand blood pressure 4 . CANTAB neuro-psychological assessment 5. outcome variable ( DAD activity daily live scale , Nottingham Extended ADL Scale , IPAQ activity questionnaire , EQ5D DEMQol quality life scale ( participant proxy ) , short FES-I fall efficacy ( fear fall ) scale , Hospital Anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) , muscle strength , Berg balance scale , Timed Up Go test , SHARE frailty instrument ) . 6 . Motivation adherence factor - Self-Reported Habit Index , BREQ-3 regulation exercise questionnaire , Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Frustration Scale , Participants perception healthcare provider motivation communication style , healthcare provider ( clinician ) perception motivational communication style . 7 . Clinician 's work motivation ( Work Extrinsic Intrinsic Motivation Scale ) Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Frustration Scale . 8 . Carer strain ( caregiver strain index ) . 9 . Participant carer service use ( CSRI ) . Following baseline assessment , participant individually randomise , stratify site , co-resident carer history previous fall , use allocation algorithm access secure web portal system hold clinical trial unit NWORTH , Bangor University . The randomisation system maintain statistician independent analysis research team ensure blind analysis . Clinical researcher inform participant treatment follow-up plan arrange clinical assessment ( allow mask RAs treatment arm ) . Access study website password protect accessible authorised individual . Due nature intervention , blind intervention impossible participant therapists administer . Outcome assessment statistical analysis blind allocation . Once randomise , participant start one activity programme ( see ) . The intervention 12-months . Follow 12 month , persistence ( hospitalisation ) 24 month . Participants ask keep detailed daily diary include activity exercise undertaken . Participants telephone monthly prompt return diary . Health social care service receive collected monthly data habit formation collect alternate month throughout trial period telephone . Data participant 's perception motivation communication collect telephone month 1 , 3 , 6 . The investigator pilot refine measure use full assessment battery , include cognition quality life . The investigator measure withdrawal , outcome measure , simple fitness , strength balance variable , acceptability intervention research interview schedule . The investigator consider impact patient characteristic ( whether live alone , severity type cognitive impairment , co-morbidity ) likelihood complete self-directed carer-supported exercise . The investigator ascertain fall diary calendar , supervise carer prompt weekly SMS text message telephone call , data GPs , hospital ambulance service , blind allocation . The investigator ensure fall ascertainment appropriate population cognitive impairment , bias across intervention arm ( e.g . therapist RSWs prompt recall fall ) . Researchers visit participant home 12 month ( +/- 2 week ) complete Disability Assessment Dementia ( DAD ) ADL scale , , Nottingham Extended ADL Scale , IPAQ activity questionnaire , 3-item CANTAB cognitive test , short fall efficacy scale ( fear fall , FES-I ) , DEMQoL EQ5D quality life questionnaire , muscle strength ( Lafayette dynamometer ) , single- dual-task Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test , Hospital Anxiety Dementia Scale ( HADS ) , SHARE frailty instrument Berg Balance Scale , rest post-exercise pulse rate . The investigator ask participant wear pedometer week 1 , 26 50 objective measure activity . The investigator ascertain health social care use , particular injurious fall , hospital admission use electronic healthcare record Client Service Receipt Inventory ( CSRI ) . The investigator use interviewer-delivered questionnaire ( pilot ) ask acceptability ease adherence programme . Researchers collect follow data blind allocation . Participants send brief questionnaire 18 24 month ask persistence exercise advice . The nominated carer notify ask supervise completion , support complete offer telephone home visit . Hospital visit 24 month ascertain hospital electronic administration record .</detailed_description>
