	<brief_title>TGR-1202 Ibrutinib Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K ) delta inhibitor TGR-1202 ( TGR-1202 ) ibrutinib relapse refractory ( rel/ref ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) define sum complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) . II . To determine event-free survival ( EFS ) , time response ( TTR ) , duration response ( DOR ) patient rel/ref DLBCL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate molecular profile patient sample ( optional lymph node biopsy ) obtain day 0 ( pre-treatment ; core biopsy ) , day 8 ( fine needle aspiration ) end treatment ( progressive disease end study treatment—1 year ; core biopsy ) . II . To evaluate baseline characteristic dynamic shifts mutational Landscape , transcriptional signature intracellular signal cascade primary tumor cell . III . To define mutational status 384 gene mutate DLBCL , include cluster differentiation ( CD ) 79B , caspase recruitment domain family member 11 ( CARD11 ) , myeloid differentiation primary response 88 ( MYD88 ) . IV . To evaluate signature B-cell receptor signal back-up pathway oxidative phosphorylation . V. To measure basal induce level activation component within parallel signal pathways downstream B-cell receptor . VI . To perform quantitative response evaluation peripheral blood cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence enrollment , day 8 , 1 month , every response assessment time point compare standard radiographic response evaluation positron emission tomography ( PET ) / compute tomography ( CT ) CT end treatment ( progressive disease end study treatment—1 year ) . VII . To evaluate genetic profile drug resistance mutation . VIII . To evaluate DLBCL subtype analysis immunohistochemistry compare Nanostring assessment . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 group . GROUP A : Patients receive PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ibrutinib PO QD day 9-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP B : Patients receive ibrutinib PO QD day 1-28 PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 PO QD day 9-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP C : Patients receive PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 PO QD ibrutinib PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 1 year .</detailed_description>
