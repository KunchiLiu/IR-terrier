	<brief_summary>Tumour biomarkers substance produce cancer cell body response cancer condition . They use help detect , diagnose , manage predict outcome recurrence type cancer . Tumour biomarkers also help doctor choose appropriate therapy judge treatment successful . Several tumour biomarkers already use clinic ; however , many others meet rigorous scientific standard enter clinical practice solid cancer detect use tissue biopsy , rather invasive procedure . Likewise , evaluate efficacy novel therapy clinical trial relies adequate specific laboratory test . Therefore novel biomarkers novel method , measure , still represent un-met clinical need . This study aim develop innovative , sensitive reliable test well target , order ass monitor circulate cancer biomarkers . Easily accessible sample , like blood , test invasive tissue biopsy avoid . Both healthy individual cancer patient recruit study establish laboratory test powerful enough distinguish individual may cancer . Participants ' involvement also support development novel test decide novel therapy efficiently counteract cancer growth . Participants study ask donate blood , sputum , urine body fluid , depend cancer assay develop . After participant give informed consent , researcher isolate cell , soluble factor nucleic acid body fluid . Researchers use various laboratory technique screen cell , soluble factor nucleic acid specific marker . This study look effectiveness use laboratory test quantify tumour marker body fluid , subsequently , monitor patient ' response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential participant approach clinical research team member ask whether would interested joining study . Participant Information Sheet handle discus individual , highlight involvement , risk benefit research . In particular , participation study alter current therapy volunteer . Having leave sufficient time decide , potential participant ask sign Consent Form . After obtain informed consent , volunteer ask donate blood , urine , sputum ( saliva ) body fluid , like bronchoalveolar lavage , study , time analysis carry part individual ' usual medical care . If participant already schedule receive novel drug therapy exist trial , may ask contribute small amount blood , saliva , urine body fluid , twice , program treatment . Samples collect time participant ' routine medical examination carry . Biological specimen collect store accord sample type test specification ; separation cellular component soluble factor liquid part perform research team member . Isolation technique vary base sample source . Depending specific assay develop , protein content analyse flow cytometry , enzyme-linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) immunoassay , include beads-based Luminex® technology . In laboratory technique , unique interaction specific antibody antigen enable identification single multiple target protein inside complex protein mixture . Flow cytometry use fluorescence property dye evaluate presence specific marker surface inside healthy cancerous cell . This help establish frequency specific cell population intensity specific marker cell . Likewise , ELISA allow qualitative quantitative characterisation soluble substance ; multiple target protein suspension evaluate Luminex® procedure within sample . Other biochemical technique , immunoblotting use determine presence/ absence protein locate either cell surface intracellularly . In addition protein , nucleic acid content assess , include DNA , RNA microRNA biomolecular technique . Research data generate laboratory method software-specific file , flow cytometry standard ( FCS ) file result flow cytometry , image data table . Parameters like sensitivity , limit detection assay variability also evaluate report numeric table . During assay development , data healthy donor cancer patient compare standard statistical package , order establish robust test discriminate two group .</detailed_description>
