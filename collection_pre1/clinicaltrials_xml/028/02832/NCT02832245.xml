	<brief_summary>The Computerized Registry Patients Venous Thromboembolism ( RIETE ) multidisciplinary Project initiate march 2001 consist obtain extensive data registry consecutive patient venous thromboembolism . The main objective provide information Internet help physician improve knowledge natural history thromboembolic disease , particularly subgroups patient usually recruit randomized clinical trial ( pregnant woman , elderly patient , disseminate cancer , severe renal insufficiency , patient contraindication anticoagulation therapy , extreme body weight , etc ) , purpose decrease mortality , frequency thromboembolic recurrence well bleed complication arterial event . As additional objective RIETE also aim create predictive score help physicians good identify patient high risk present complication . The primary parameter record registry comprise detail patient 's clinical status , include coexist underlying condition , type , dose , duration outcome ( first 3 month therapy ) antithrombotic treatment . Study endpoints clinically recognize ( objectively confirm ) recurrence VTE , major minor bleeding complication , death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The RIETE Registry pretend improvement care patient thromboembolic disease . Very often investigator pose serious doubt manage specific patient . Sometimes patient thrombocytopenia , pregnant woman , patient recent cerebral bleed cerebral metastasis , patient gastroduodenal ulcer hepatic cirrhosis . There clinical evidence investigator manage patient investigator individualize management . The bibliography available much help . Only investigator database sufficient number case , may able make evidence base decision . This database Internet allow investigator consult obtain immediate response take care patient need individualized management . After introduce patient investigator automatically obtain data patient similar clinical profile . And help investigator identify high-risk patient thus facilitate prevent possible future complication .</detailed_description>
