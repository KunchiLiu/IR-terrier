	<brief_summary>There different inhibition suboccipital technique , usually adjuvant physiotherapy , treatment patient chronic neck pain . In clinical practice , favorable effect observe patient chronic neck pain , publish study evaluate result technique pain , mobility disability . The objective trial evaluate suboccipital manual technique , provide improvement pain intensity , neck disability , range motion , patient chronic mechanical neck pain rotation deficit upper cervical spine , treat physiotherapy . For purpose , investigator conduct double-blind ( patient evaluator ) randomize control trial , Public Primary Care Center . Seventy four subject randomize ( computer application ) three group : Mobilization Group , Maintained pressure Group Control Group . All three group receive protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment three week , additionally , Mobilization Group receive six session ( two session week three week ) translational dorsal glide mobilization technique grade III atlanto-occipital joint Maintained pressure Group receive six session ( two session week three week ) pressure maintain suboccipital Inhibition technique . The Control Group receive protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment . Pain intensity ( VAS ) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , Range motion ( CROM ) , measure baseline , treatment period , three month discharge treatment . After discharge treatment patient subjective opinion evolution collect Global Rating Change ( GROC ) scale , evaluation headache disability ( HIT-6 ) .</brief_summary>
