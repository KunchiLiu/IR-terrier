	<brief_summary>The incidence prevalence dialysis Taiwan remain high compare past several year . The number dialysis report 6-7 million people year 2014 full-year cost estimation 330 million NTDs . According age-standardized population statistic 1995 , number dialysis per million population 2006 year 372.2 people , 381.9 people 2012 year annual growth rate 0.43 percent record . EarlySense system certify TFDA , FDA many country , consist mainly two part . One sense element , place mattress one AC-powered display panel bed . This system ability monitor patient physiological function contact via bed . When patient lay bed , sensor place bed would detect heart rate , breathe rate activity level well physiological signal . The system also able distinguish patient bed bed operation save patient 's record information ( include heart rate , respiratory rate level activity , may render trend ) . The system also capability real-time data transmission information include warn nurse ' station monitoring center screen provide real-time information nurse . In research project , use EarlySense equipment continuous monitoring dialysis patient 's physiological data along clinical data A. acute complication rapid change blood pressure , respiratory rate , movement patient Nausea vomit , etc phenomenon 's ) B . Lab examination data C. Status patient whether patient hospitalized patient death occur . The study expect pilot study three month ' duration . Through EarlySense continuous monitoring gather data , analyse develop prediction model confirm indicator . Evidences analytics would help propose way improve implement Positive predictive validity model .</brief_summary>
