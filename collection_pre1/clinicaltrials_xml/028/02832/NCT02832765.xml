	<brief_summary>The primary goal study determine local control-rate radiotherapy ( RT ) without simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) concepts patient bone metastases spine . Further study objective survival , clinical parameter pain , quality life ( QoL ) fatigue . We expect improvement local control consecutively increase re-sclerotization bone metastasis due high biological dose tumor area . Therefore patient could benefit quality-of-life , pain relief mobility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy With Integrated-boost Patients With Spinal Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vertebral column main localization bone metastases frequently indicate advanced stage malignant primary disease [ 1 , 2 ] . Two third patient tumor estimate develop bone metastasis course disease [ 3 ] . Spinal bone metastases central impact patient palliative setting . The clinical symptom include pain rest exercise also impaired activity daily life , risk pathological fracture , neurological deficit . Local control essential factor stability vertebral body patient spinal bone metastasis . In regard re-calcification former osteolytic lesion , palliative radiotherapy ( RT ) represent effective treatment option [ 4 ] . The common schedule specify 30 Gy 10 fraction . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) use intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) safe modality treat spinal metastasis enhance target accuracy [ 5 ] . Secondly , IMRT spine well tolerate ( especially spinal cord ) , significant late toxicity , spar organ risk simultaneously [ 6 ] . The main problem standard schedule limit dose application metastasis due organ risk myelon . Therefore , aim study apply high biological dose tumor region achieve improve result related local control palliative patient painful spinal bone metastasis . Secondly , aim evaluate QoL , fatigue , survival three different RT-techniques . To best knowledge , comparable randomize study describe literature far .</detailed_description>
