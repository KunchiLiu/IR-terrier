	<detailed_description>1.1 Background . Caffeine use psychoactive drug Canada , regular consumption 88 % adult population unique `` cradle-to-grave drug '' . In Canada , coffee commonly consume source caffeine , tea , chocolate energy drink also significantly use . This significant rate consumption likely due part caffeine 's action human brain , result increase arousal , elevate mood cognitive enhancement . The effect caffeine , least level typically see human consumption , primarily relate action adenosine receptor . Caffeine 's antagonistic effect adenosine see even single cup coffee , increase consumption result increase blockade . Adenosine receptor distribute brain cell , contribute caffeine 's ability affect wide range brain region . While level caffeine consumption consider high general population , evidence may even high within schizophrenia ( SZ ) patient . In recent U.S. study 146 community-dwelling individual SZ , daily consumption rate caffeine nearly double observed healthy control population ( 471.6 mg/day vs. 254.2 mg/day ; p &lt; .001 ) . Furthermore , 13 % SZ population study ingested 1000 mg/day caffeine , high observe intake 2647.2 mg/day . To place context , Health Canada recommend adult consume 400 mg caffeine per day , dose 250 mg potential induce symptom anxiety , agitation , irritability insomnia . High dos caffeine particularly concern individual SZ caffeine alters dopaminergic activity post-synaptic neuron action adenosine A2A receptor ; enhances dopamine function , result increased locomotor activity appear exacerbate positive symptom , delusion hallucination . Another effect caffeine particular relevance SZ involve interaction atypical antipsychotic drug , clozapine . Both clozapine caffeine metabolize liver cytochrome P450 system , particular , CYP1A2 isoenzyme . Competition clozapine caffeine report elevate antipsychotic blood level , increase risk clinically significant side effect high dosage level caffeine . As , give high consumption level potential negative side effect caffeine SZ , important understand cortical mechanism underlie caffeine use . As caffeine mainly use perceive stimulant property , include enhanced mental alertness increase energy , research conduct examine effect caffeine cognitive performance human . These study identify beneficial effect caffeine wide-range cognitive process include verbal working memory , sustain attention , executive function . It must note , however , many study report pro-cognitive effect caffeine , others report significant improvement deficit performance . This may least partially explained evidence suggest 'inverted U-shaped ' dose-response curve caffeine , wherein low dos positive effect performance , high dos ( i.e. , 500 mg ) cause decrease performance . Within field attention information processing , electroencephalographically ( EEG ) -derived event-related potential ( ERPs ) provide exquisitely sensitive method index cognition complement clarify behavioural observation . The ERP waveform elicit response specific stimulus , tone light flash , cognitive event , recognition , decision making response specific stimuli event . Specifically , ERPs represent average neural activity follow onset stimulus . In study examine effect caffeine brain , EEG/ERPs appear preferable neuroimaging technique fMRI PET vasoconstrictive nature caffeine may confound latter technique , model cortical blood flow . EEG/ERPs avoid potential confounds , furthermore , provide temporal resolution far superior sophisticated imaging technique ( i.e . PET , fMRI ) , make methodology far suitable capture instantaneous change information processing . While literature caffeine 's effect ERP-indexed cognitive process limit , evidence caffeine enhance ERPs . In one study , quick behavioural respond visual search task caffeine ( vs. placebo ) , also quicker ERP measure target detection , although caffeine alter ERP amplitude . While hallmark characteristic SZ neurocognitive impairment , deficits notably overlap cognitive domain improve caffeine . Among core deficts observe within SZ dysfunction attentional system , observed patient acutely psychotic remission . Deficits attention SZ include alteration sustain attention , particularly measure continuous performance task visual selective attention ( Luck &amp; Gold , 2008 ) , measure visual search task . It suggest within SZ deficit attention contribute dysfunction central executive work memory , limit capacity system store manipulate information short time period ( ~30 ) , order carry complex cognitive operation planning , reason , problem solving . Impairment work memory process , indexed n-back task , robust feature SZ , stable time , independent psychotic symptom . While literature , albeit small , examining effect caffeine cognition brain activity healthy individual , research report non-existent SZ ( base extensive search PsycINFO PubMed ) . This gap literature particularly notable give rate caffeine consumption observe within SZ . The sole study address caffeine might impact cognitive process SZ do within animal model employ MK-801 ( potent NMDA receptor antagonist ) infuse mouse . Within behavioural model SZ , chronic treatment caffeine improve measure long term memory , reduce MK-801-induced perseverative error one study , another study find effect chronic caffeine cognition mouse give significantly high dose MK-801 . 1.2 Objective . This project propose examine caffeine alters ERP-indexed aspect cognition SZ patient . Neural ( ERPs ) behavioural ( hit , reaction time ) correlate cognitive performance probe within randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled design battery well-established cognitive paradigm demonstrate deficit SZ associate caffeine-induced enhancement : visual selective attention paradigm ( visual search task ) , work memory paradigm ( N-back ) , sustain attention paradigm ( AX-CPT ) . The primary outcome measure ERP amplitude latency . Secondary index include behavioural measure performance , include accuracy ( % correct ) , reaction time measure signal detection ( i.e . ' ) . While investigator expect caffeine improve behavioural neural index group , investigator expect effect strong SZ patient due expect low baseline . 2 . Materials Methods . 2.1 Study Design Procedure . This study employ randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , repeated measure design consist two experimental session separate least 24 hr , participant receive caffeine one day placebo day . The order caffeine administration counterbalance , half participant randomly administer caffeine first placebo second session , remain half administer caffeine placebo reverse order . Prior experimental session , participant complete inform consent , give opportunity read study description question answer , complete demographic questionnaire , experimental session schedule . Participants attend BIOTIC Neuroimaging Research Lab QEII Health Sciences Centre ( Halifax , NS ) , morning ( i.e . test begin 9-11 ) test session . Participants require abstain illicit drug , over-the-counter medication , alcohol cigarette begin midnight previous day . SZ patient ask halt pause current medication regimen . Additionally , participant ask abstain caffeine ( include coffee , tea cola ) least 6 hour prior test session ensure adequate clearance circulate caffeine ( half-life = 2.5-4.5 hr ) . Upon arrival laboratory , follow self-report adherence pre-testing abstinence , drug treatment administer , EEG electrodes apply , 30 minute drug administration , volunteer assess test battery , present randomized order avoid order effect . All test procedure carry accordance Declaration Helsinki follow approval relevant research ethic board . 2.2 Caffeine . As previous study investigate effect caffeine electrophysiological measure , session participant ask swallow ( water ) one two identical pill capsule contain either caffeine ( 200 mg ) placebo . This method dosage select oral administration caffeine result efficient absorption , intermediate size dose , typical study caffeine cognition , show exert widespread , strong cerebral effect . Furthermore , administration caffeine pill form allow great control dosage facilitate double-blind procedure , control potentially confound sensory effect ( e.g . smell , taste coffee ) . 2.3 Test Battery . 2.3.1 Visual Search Task . The visual search task follow methodology describe Lorenzo-Lopez colleague previously use psychopharmacology research . In short , participant instruct perform visual search , consist detect target stimulus ( vertical bar ) among array distractors ( horizontal bar ) indicate whether target present absent search array press green button response pad one hand red button hand , respectively . Behavioral measure include number correct response , reaction time ( RTs ) correct response . Neural ( ERP ) measure interest include N2pc , index visual spatial shift attention location target distractor , P3b , index target detection . The amplitude ERPs indicate amount resource allocate associated cognitive process , latency represent process speed . Hypotheses : Caffeine significantly speed behavioural index target detection ( i.e . reduce RTs ) associate neural waveform ( i.e . reduce latency N2pc &amp; P3b ) group , increase amplitude observed SZ patient . 2.3.2 Visual Sustained Attention ( AX-CPT ) . Sustained attention assess within A-X version continuous performance task ( AX-CPT ) . Participants present series letter instruct respond letter `` X '' immediately precede `` A . '' In order test sustain attention , 400 letter present span 11 minute consist 80 cue ( `` A '' ) , 40 target ( `` A '' follow `` X '' ) , 40 NoGos ( `` A '' follow letter ) , 240 distractors ( letter `` X '' precede `` A '' ) . Behavioural endpoint include number RTs correct response , false alarm ( i.e. , nontarget response ) . Neural ( ERP ) measure interest include P3b correct target . Hypotheses : Consistent previous report sustain attention , caffeine impact behavioural performance , increase P300 amplitudes , effect ( vs. placebo ) see participant group . 2.3.3 Visual Working Memory . This paradigm , previously use psychopharmacology research , employ four randomized condition verbal N-Back task ; condition identical stimulus response demand , consist increase level working-memory load . A series letter present participant require respond quickly possible letter screen match letter n stimuli back ( i.e. , 0-back condition , target letter match pre-specified letter ( x ) , 1-back , 2-back 3-back condition , target letter identical letter present one , two three trial back , respectively ) . As N-back task require information storage , update , manipulation , become dominant tool use assess WM control function . Behavioural endpoint measure include accuracy ( % correct target detection ) reaction time ( m ) target . Additionally , condition drug treatment I calculate signal detection sensitivity ( ' ) response bias ( C ) . Electrophysiological endpoint measure include amplitude latency P3b target . Hypotheses : Similar paradigm , consistent behavioural study caffeine 's effect n-back indexed work memory , investigator expect caffeine reduce RTs reduce P300 latency group . 2.4 EEG Recording ERP Computation . ERPs extract EEG activity record electrode cap Ag+/Ag+-Cl- active electrode sixty-four scalp site accord 10-10 system electrode placement , include : three midline site ( frontal [ Fz ] , central [ Cz ] , parietal [ Pz ] ) ; three leave hemisphere ( frontal [ F3 ] , central [ C3 ] , parietal [ P3 ] ) three right hemisphere ( frontal [ F4 ] , central [ C4 ] , parietal [ P4 ] ) scalp site ; bilateral mastoid activity . Electrodes also place mid-forehead nose serve ground reference , respectively . Bipolar recording horizontal ( HEOG ) vertical ( VEOG ) electro-oculogram activity take supra-/sub-orbital external canthus site , respectively . All electrode impedance keep 5kohms . Electrical activity record amplifier bandpass 0.1 30 Hz , digitize 500 Hz , store hard-disk later off-line analysis . Stimuli ( result trigger ERP analysis ) generate Presentation software ( Neurobehavioural Systems , Berkeley CA ) 2.5 Questionnaires . In order ass clinical variable SZ patient , well caffeine consumption , 2 questionnaire administer : 1 ) Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale ( PSYRATS ) . The PSYRATS design quantify auditory hallucination delusion , associate consumption caffeine ; 2 ) Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire ( CCQ ) . Collects detailed information caffeine consumption , include source caffeine ( e.g. , coffee , cola , etc… ) time period caffeine consumption . As questionnaire probe trait ( vs. state ) measure , administer . 2.6 Data Analysis . Data subject separate ANOVA/ANCOVA procedure ( SPSS , IBM Corp. , Armonk NY ) . For paradigm , endpoint measure analyze mixed ANOVAs , between-group ( 2 level : patient , control ) within-group/repeated measure factor include drug ( caffeine , placebo ) . Analysis EEG/ERP endpoint also include scalp site within-group factor . Daily caffeine consumption ( measure CCQ ) use covariate . Follow-up significant ( Greenhouse-Geisser correct ) main interaction effect ( p &lt; .05 ) carry Bonferroni-adjusted planned comparison use separate ( vs. pool ) error estimate . In order examine correlation behavioural/electrophysiological endpoint measure caffeine consumption , two-tailed Spearman 's rho correlation conduct consumption measure ERP amplitudes/latencies placebo drug condition , well consumption measure measure drug-associated change ERP endpoints overall within group .</detailed_description>
