	<brief_title>BC ECPR Trial Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>British Columbia province contain four metropolitan area , contains least one tertiary care centre provide Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) cardiovascular surgery service , addition critical cardiology service coronary catheterization laboratory . Pre-hospital medical care area provide British Columbia Emergency Health Services ( BCEHS ) , use tiered system basic life support advance life support ( ALS ) paramedic ( 90 % case ALS involvement ) coordination fire department first responder . Medical provider study footprint extensive experience interventional trial enrol patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , participation Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium . Through collaboration clinician area BCEHS , study examine benefit regional ECPR protocol establish one metropolitan area ( `` ECPR Protocol Region '' ) , comparison area ( `` Usual Care Region '' ) . The primary aim determine benefit incorporate ECPR service regional medical system care out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . All patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treat emergency medical service ( EMS ) region prospectively evaluate study eligibility . Secondary aim include : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness ECPR therapy refractory cardiac arrest 45 minute attempted resuscitation . 2 . To evaluate effectiveness regional ECPR protocol , comparison historical control . 3 . To evaluate long-term ( 5-year ) outcomes patient treat ECPR . 4 . To evaluate quantity successful organ procurement treat ECPR . 5 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness regional ECPR protocol . This control study parallel group design group allocation base region treatment . The investigator compare outcomes ECPR-eligible patient intervention region , comparison patient meet criterion comparable setting . The effect treatment group assess adjust important prognosticator out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( include initial cardiac rhythm , time emergency medical service [ EMS ] arrival , bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ CPR ] , EMS-witnessed arrest , age ) . In addition , region cardiac arrest may independent predictor outcome , include final adjustment . The investigator prospectively collect data patient fit study criterion region 2012 2015 . Outcomes historical data compare region , well historical data region individually compare study period , order estimate independent effect region treatment .</detailed_description>
