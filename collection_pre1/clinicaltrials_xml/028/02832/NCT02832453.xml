	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness different dos supervise exercise training intensity -concomitant lifestyle counselling- Primary Health Care intervention tool management metabolic syndrome low active adult one metabolic risk factor . Secondary aim study investigate effect intervention systemic inflammation adipose tissue function , cardiorespiratory fitness , physical activity sedentary habit , cost-effectiveness intervention regard health relate quality life . The general hypothesis adult risk factor metabolic syndrome participate intervention promotion healthy lifestyle together counsel strategy include supervised physical exercise vigorous intensity present great improvement term metabolic risk , physical condition , physical activity/sedentary behaviour psychological parameter end intervention 6-months follow-up participant intervention promotion healthy lifestyle include counsel plus physical exercise low-to-moderate intensity intervention base exclusively counsel . It three arm control randomized clinical trial implement Primary Health Care set 10 month duration . Adults age 30 52 year metabolic risk factor randomize three intervention group give one following : assessment healthy lifestyle plus high intensity physical exercise supervision ( 3 individual 6 group session + 16 supervised training lesson ) ; assessment plus low-to-moderate intensity physical exercise supervision ( 3 individual 6 group session + 16 supervised training lesson ) assessment-based programme without physical exercise supervision ( 3 individual 6 group session ) . The main output variable evaluate : ) risk factor metabolic syndrome ( waist circumference , blood pressure , plasma triglyceride , high density lipoprotein glucose ) , systemic inflammation adipose tissue functionality , physical activity habit sedentary conduct , dietary habit , quality life relate health , self-efficacy empowerment . The economic cost also analyse determine cost-effectiveness program . These variable assess 3 time alongside study : baseline , end 4 month intervention , 6 month follow-up . It estimate recruit 33 participant per group , 100 participant .</detailed_description>
