	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-center , single-treatment prospective evaluation ThermiRF device treatment submental skin laxity . The purpose prospective study determine effectiveness safety ThermiRF device achieve overall submental lift . In study , `` Lift '' define ≥ 20 mm2 lift submental area ThermiRF treatment . A total 70 male female healthy volunteer age 35 65 consider study . Subjects sign inform consent form meet entry criterion enrol study assign unique number/code preserve confidentiality . A total six study visit plan described : - Visit 1 : Screening visit - ( Day 1 ) - Visit 2 : Single Treatment visit - Visit 3 : Day 30 safety assessment ( ± 7 14 day ) - Visit 4 : Day 60 safety Image capture validation exercise ( ± 7 14 day ) - Visit 5 : Day 90 safety effectiveness follow-up visit ( ± 7 14 day ) - Visit 6 : Day 180 safety effectiveness follow-up visit - ( ± 7 14 day ) Photo image ( 2D 3D ) collect Visits 1 , Visit 4 ( first 30 subject ) , Visits 5 6 use standard camera ( 2D ) Vectra system ( 3D ) . The purpose photo quantitatively qualitative evaluate treatment effectiveness use objective subjective assessment measure physical change skin 's microstructure aesthetic skin feature time . A skin elasticity assessment use Cutomer collect Visits 1 ( screen ) , 5 ( Day 90 ) 6 ( Day 180 ) ass biomechanical change skin occur result ThermiRF treatment . Safety assessment collect use Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) 10-point scale , adverse event report ( observe report ) . The overall study duration approximately 12 month ( i.e. , 5-6 month recruitment period 6 month study visit ) .</detailed_description>
