	<detailed_description>Background : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) heart failure ( HF ) lead cause mortality morbidity , particularly current context age population . Subclinical hypothyroidism ( SHypo ) , define elevate serum TSH level normal thyroxine value , common old adult ( 5-10 % ) . Prospective cohort study , well analyse pool individual participant data suggest 60-90 % increase risk CHD HF event among adult severe SHypo . However , large randomize control trial ( RCT ) assess impact thyroid replacement cardiovascular ( CV ) image outcome ( large trial date : 45 participant ) . Imaging endpoint especially well-suited early trial investigational therapy HF treatment prevention , well validate strong surrogate marker clinical outcome . Specific Aims : The goal proposal address impact thyroid replacement subclinical atherosclerosis . Methods : The investigator conduct RCT 185 patient subclinical hypothyroidism randomly assign thyroxine placebo average follow-up 24 month baseline ( 4 death 17 withdrawal ) . The main outcome CV image modality measure carotid ultrasound close-out visit . Ultrasound carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) use assess subclinical atherosclerosis plaque burden . All image centralize core lab blind standardized interpretation . Expected value propose project : Controversies persist regard indication screen treatment SHypo due lack appropriately power RCT address impact thyroid replacement CV outcomes . Assessment impact thyroid replacement subclinical atherosclerosis within trial aid decision evidence-based guideline development treat potential modifiable risk factor , SHypo . The strengths study include combination : 1 ) High feasibility project collaboration large RCT SHypo make possible investigate mechanism association CV disease ; 2 ) Innovative project combine CV image assess subclinical atherosclerosis thyroid replacement therapy vs. placebo ; 3 ) Excellent power give large sample size participant ' old age . The sample size proposal 5-fold high previous small trial thyroid replacement CV outcomes comparable statin trial show positive impact CIMT . The collaboration CV image modality expertise ongoing large trial SHypo , unique opportunity address clinical scientific issue impact SHypo CV system .</detailed_description>
