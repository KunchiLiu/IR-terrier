	<detailed_description>Low birth weight infant premature infant bear birth weight less 1500 g. Because infant low birth weight , weight gain increase fortify breast milk post-natal 7. day . Breast milk fortifiers might prefer low birth weight extremely low birth weight infant ( infant &lt; 1000 g birth weight infant ) fast weight gain . It increase risk necrotizing enterocolitis infection ; low incidence necrotizing enterocolitis sepsis compare formula . Breast milk usually fortify 100 cc/kg/day enteral feeding ( 1,2,3,4 ) . Even though many center use olive oil fortify breast milk many year ; study evaluate scientific value . Hence known olive oil base parenteral nutrition solution well-tolerated premature infant , immunologically neutral , increase proinflammatory cytokine ; olive oil fat consume natural form antimicrobial cytotoxic effect , lower serum cholesterol concentration decrease cholesterol absorption , protective measure cardiovascular disease due antioxidant effect ingredient mono- poly-unsaturated fatty acid , phenolic substance , tocopherol carotenoid ; olive oil antioxidant , cell renewal anti- carcinogenic feature contain squalene precursor steroid synthesis help digestion increase digestive juice major pigment chlorophyll , pheophytin chlorophyll ( 5 ) . In previous study ; show nutritional support parenteral olive oil emulsion well plasma lipid content similarity breast milk , low proinflammatory cytokine synthesis , low lipid peroxidation product level , strong T-cell response , high E vitamin level ; thus low risk nosocomial infection , SIRS ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome ) , BPD ( bronchopulmonary dysplasia ) , NEC ( necrotizing enterocolitis ) , PVL ( periventricular leukomalacia ) , ROP ( retinopathy prematurity ) cardiovascular disease positive impact glucose metabolism . Participants hypothesize oral olive oil intake similar effect ( 6 ) . Investigators aim compare post-nutritional immunologic parameter 1-28 day-aged 60 infant &lt; 1500 g birth weight &lt; 32 week gestational age feed maternal milk fortify eoprotin olive oil diagnose followed-up Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Pediatrics Department Medicine Faculty Yüzüncü Yıl University . This study conduct 60 patient 1-28 days-aged , 1500-gram body weight , born 32 week gestational age diagnose followed Neonatal Unit Pediatrics Department Medicine Faculty Yüzüncü Yıl University . For 45 day , 30 patient receive eoprotin breast milk fortifier another 30 patient receive olive oil , 3 cc blood take patient 0 , 15. , 30. 45. day biochemistry vial store -80 C centrifuge . At end study , vial thaw room temperature serum TNF-alpha , IL-1 Beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 level analyze ELISA method BIO-Tec ELx800 Absorbance Reader device lipid profile ( LDL , HDL , Total cholesterol triglyceride ) level analyze spectrophotometric method Architect ci16200 ; parameter compare . After feed olive oil infant receive amount calorie infant receive eoprotin-fortified breast milk . At end study , participant identify olive oil n't increase proinflammatory cytokine provide enough weight gain premature infant , investigator suggest olive oil replace eoprotin costly breast milk-fortifier . Investigators believe situation contribute country family budget .</detailed_description>
