	<detailed_description>Introduction Resistant hypertension ( RH ) characterize blood pressure ( BP ) remain recommended goal take three antihypertensive drug synergistic action , maximum recommend tolerated dos least six month ; one preferably diuretic . True RH differentiate pseudo resistance , occurs due non-adherence treatment , inadequate BP measurement , inadequate dos medication , inappropriate therapeutic regimen , presence so-called white-coat effect . The exact prevalence RH unknown . In controlled randomized study thousand hypertensive patient , approximately 25 % 30 % participant achieve BP goal recommend guideline despite receive three antihypertensive drug ; study include careful assessment adherence therapy even ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) , exclude patient pseudo resistance . Observational data North American National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) collect 2003-2008 show prevalence RH among adult diagnose hypertension ( HTN ) period 8.9 % among adults antihypertensive treatment , 12.8 % . Similarly , large population study Spain ( 68,000 patient ) find prevalence RH 14.8 % among treated HTN . Based recent study , justifiable say prevalence RH 14 % . RH difficult-to-manage clinical condition due failure patient adhere treatment , physician 's difficulty adjust medication genetic factor hinder effectiveness treatment medical inertia . Pathophysiology resistant hypertension : The mechanism involve pathophysiology RH vascular smooth muscle tone increase blood volume , intensification activity sympathetic system hyperactivity renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . Increased sensitivity sodium appear main factor understand pathophysiology syndrome , incorporate mechanism , also explain , part , variability therapeutic response patient RH . The RAAS vital regulatory system control total body sodium atrial natriuretic peptide factor pressure receptor atria kidney . Sodium water retention lead resistance antihypertensive drug . Under physiological point view , BP maintain continuous regulation cardiac output peripheral vascular resistance exert three anatomic site : arteriole , postcapillary venule ( capacitance vessel ) heart . A fourth anatomical site control , kidney , contribute maintenance BP regulate intravascular volume . Rational : Thus , identify contribution volume serum renin maintain BP level could help tailor treatment effective choice hypertension control , whether act control volume sodium balance , act effect RAAS kidney . Sequential nephron blockade consist progressive increase sodium depletion . After administration thiazide diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) aldosterone receptor blocker , low dos furosemide administer subsequently amiloride prescribe enhance natriuretic effect . The blockade RAAS increase effect angiotensin receptor 1 blocker ( ARBs ) . Therapy require sequentially add angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor reduce level angiotensin ( Ang ) II result blockage Ang II receptor administer beta-blocker decrease elevate renin secretion due ACE inhibitor ARBs . Research question : The follow research question explore : Do sequential nephron blockade ( SNB ) dual blockade renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol ( DBB ) constitute good therapeutic option reduction peripheral blood pressure patient RH ? Which therapeutic option able reduce central BP resistant hypertensive patient ? Is strategy SNB good DBB ? Objectives : This study compare two antihypertensive treatment regimen RH patient Medical School Sao Jose Rio Preto . It aim demonstrate therapeutic efficacy SNB DBB RH patient , assess side effect , adherence therapy 20 week treatment . Methods : A randomized clinical trial two therapeutic regimen RH , SNB DBB , compare open-label prospective study Medical School Sao Jose Rio Preto .
