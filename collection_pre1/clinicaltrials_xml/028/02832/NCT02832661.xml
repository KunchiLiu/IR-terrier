	<brief_summary>Biomargin European research program aim evaluate diagnostic performance biomarkers respect renal graft injury , well prognostic performance respect 3-year 5-year graft outcome . Nucleic acid , proteins metabolite previously identify candidate biomarkers individual kidney graft lesion determine systematically urine blood sample collect patient time transplantation onwards , well graft tissue biopsy require medical cause perform systematically investigation centre . Their diagnostic prognostic performance check histological reading biopsy evolution graft function time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In renal allograft recipient , 10-year graft survival much improve past decade . There thus need robust , non-invasive method predict diagnose acute chronic graft lesion , improve patient treatment , quality life long-term graft survival . Also , unmet need good understand immune non-immune mechanism interstitial fibrosis /tubular atrophy graft loss . Several team search biomarkers renal graft lesion , cross-fecundation different `` omics '' approach , consolidation different cluster biomarkers discover use different technology . An analysis different omics level base principle system biology therefore necessary gain insight disease mechanism help develop predictor individual level . Purpose : The European project BIOMARGIN aim discover , select validate blood and/or urine biomarkers renal allograft lesion adult paediatric kidney transplant recipient integrate several omics approach ( mRNA , miRNA , peptide , protein , lipid metabolite ) blood , graft tissue urine . The European cohort study BECS aim evaluate diagnostic prognostic performance select biomarkers first 3 5 year post-transplantation . Study design : This multicenter , international , ambispective , open non-interventional cohort study , collection biological sample . Number subject : 450 adult 50 paediatric renal transplant recipient . Outcomes : The primary endpoint graft outcome , assess three year lesion appear graft biopsy patient enrolment , decline graft function ≥ 30 % , graft loss patient death . Secondary endpoint include : histological finding indication biopsy well systematic biopsy ( per centre procedure ) 5 year ; cumulate acute rejection episode ; 3-year 5-year graft survival ; change renal function assess glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) estimate use MDRD formula . Statistical analysis : The sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value different biomarkers set biomarkers evaluate primary secondary endpoint . In order compare performance biomarkers know risk factor deterioration renal graft function , longitudinal statistical modelling use .</detailed_description>
