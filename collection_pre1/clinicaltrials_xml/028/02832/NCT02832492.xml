	<detailed_description>Behavioral assessment regard gold standard current evaluation consciousness prognostic prediction patient disorder consciousness . ( DOC ) However , rely examiner ' subjective interpretation patients'behavior applicable patient without motor function . Previous study suggest pupil near response relationship consciousness inspiration study.In study , prognostic value pupil near response DOC patient test patient unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( UWS , new name vegetative state ) .If result encouraging , suggest patient PNR minimally conscious state ( MCS ) already first CRS-R assessment.Moreover , PNR objectively measure need activation skeletal muscle , solution problem current evaluation consciousness DOC patient mention . A PNR test conduct patient diagnosed UWS Coma recovery scale-revised assessment see PNR positive . ( CRS-R ) According result test , patient divide 2 group , one include patient PNR , one include patient without PNR.3 month later , follow conduct obtain prognosis form another CRS-R assessment.Patients diagnose MCS consider favourable prognosis , patient diagnose UWS dead consider unfavourable prognosis.Their favourable prognostic difference ( difference group 's proportion MCS patient diagnose CRS-R follow ) compare see PNR relationship consciousness . And able show conscious visual behavior ( visual behavior CRS-R indicate MCS ) first CRS-R might misdiagnosed reason , difference recovery conscious visual function ( difference group 's proportion patient show conscious visual behavior diagnose CRS-R follow ) compare see PNR applicable patient without motor function . Researchers expect see group include patient PNR great proportion comparison .</detailed_description>
