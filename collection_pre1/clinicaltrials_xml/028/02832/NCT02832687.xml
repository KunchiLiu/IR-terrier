	<brief_summary>Study Objective The aim propose study examine effect Q4 hour multidose IV acetaminophen patient ' readiness discharge . In investigator also investigate various factor could potentially contribute patient 's readiness discharge overall opioid consumption , time rescue medication , incidence postoperative nausea vomiting , pain score , perioperative stress marker overall correlation IV acetaminophen intake .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-dose Acetaminophen Patients Undergoing General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-arm parallel study.. Patients 50kg receive either 1000mg IV acetaminophen placebo first dose give preoperatively hold area follow re-dosing every four hour point maximum 4 dos 4000mg 24 hour . Patients &lt; 50 kg receive 12.5mg/kg maximum 75 mg /per kg/per day per label dose repeat dose Q4 hour . After pre-oxygenation , general anesthesia induce lidocaine ( 1 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight ) , propofol ( 1-2 mg/kg Actual Body Weight ) , fentanyl ( 5 mcg/kg Actual Body Weight ) . Additionally subject receive 2 mg midazolam . Tracheal intubation facilitate rocuronium ( 0.6 - 1.2 mg/kg Actual Body Weight ) . Anesthesia maintain air/oxygen ( 60 % /40 % ) desflurane . A remifentanyl infusion ( 0.05-2mcg/kg/min Ideal Body Weight ) continue throughout entire case analgesic administer . All patient receive ondansetron 4 mg prior end operation well additional antiemetic PACU judge attend anesthesiologist . Patients awaken extubated OR meet standard extubation criterion . Once extubated patient transfer PACU assess via SPEEDs criterion 5 minute arrival every 15 minute duration PACU stay . While PACU , patient assess pain use Visual Analog Scale . Pain treat per protocol 0.2mg IV hydromorphone mild pain ( VAS 1-3 ) , 0.4 mg IV hydromorphone moderate pain ( VAS 4-6 ) , 0.6 mg IV hydromorphone ( VAS 7-10 ) . As soon patient meet SPEEDs criterion he/she transfer phase II recovery . In phase II , need , pain manage accord follow order : 0.2mg intravenous hydromorphone mild pain ( VAS 1-3 ) , 0.4 mg intravenous hydromorphone moderate pain ( VAS 4-6 ) 0.6mg intravenous hydromorphone severe pain ( VAS 7-10 ) . The patient 's readiness discharge primary outcome . Each patient assess within 5 minute arrive PACU every 15 minute thereafter subject reach maximum score . The assessment do use SPEEDs criterion , recently show specific sensitive phase 1 nursing intervention therefore accurate predict patient fast-track eligible compare standard Modified Aldrete 2 Fast-Track criterion ( 38 ) . The secondary outcome include : 1 . Post-operative pain score . Assessed every 15 minute recovery period use Visual Numerical Analog Scales 2 hour every 4 hour thereafter discharge . 2 . Time first rescue medication . 0.2mg intravenous hydromorphone mild pain ( VAS 1-3 ) b . 0.4mg intravenous hydromorphone moderate pain ( VAS 4-6 ) c. 0.6 mg intravenous hydromorphone severe pain ( VAS 7-10 ) 3 . Total dosage post-operative opioids give . 4 . Incidence post operative nausea vomit need additional antiemetic . 5 . Phase II satisfaction survey : . This focus three follow factor rat scale 1 5 , 1 dissatisfied/unlikely 5 satisfied/very likely . . How satisfied overall experience ? ii . How likely recommend anesthetic analgesic others ? iii . How likely would ask similar anesthetic analgesic future need ? f ) Concentration plasma stress marker include cortisol , norepinephrine , epinephrine , C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) . . Changes mediator level IV acetaminophen versus placebo group compare . Plasma sample collect administration drug ( placement IV line ) , incision , 60 minute arrival PACU . Blood [ 15millLiters ] collect time point describe additional intravenous catheter place patient 's arm . These specimen place vacutainer tubes anti-coagulant . Blood drawn syringe attach directly angiocatheter place intravenously . To prevent hemolysis , blood transfer without needle , vacutainer whose top remove . The vacutainer top replace specimen label study name , subject 's study IDentification number , sample number ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ) , date . Bloods first two time point keep refrigerated final sample obtain postoperatively . They centrifuge , serum remove , aliquoted stored -80 degree C analysis . All sample run duplicate plate reagent lot . Any sample vary great 15 % duplicate</detailed_description>
