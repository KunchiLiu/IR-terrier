	<brief_summary>Although first outpatient review follow cardiac surgery conventionally schedule six week hospital discharge , evidence support practice . Thirty-day mortality morbidity rate , widely use indicator quality surgical care , reveal rate higher corresponding in-hospital rate . Secondly , rate mortality morbidity occur 6 week surgery know . The objective study determine postoperative mortality morbidity rate 6-week interval hospital discharge first plan specialist review cardiac surgery , assess level patient satisfaction current practice . The study enrol eligible patient undergo elective urgent coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery institution 6-month period provide study information . Prior discharge surgery , prospective participant consent give questionnaire take home , complete bring along outpatient appointment . The investigator analyse data determine rate time complication , impact postoperative recovery . The investigator also assess level patient satisfaction current practice . Appropriate conclusion either support current practice , change practice would drawn..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Six Weeks Too Long First Outpatient Review After Cardiac Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Background In current practice , patient undergone cardiac surgery return outpatient clinic first postoperative review specialist team , six week hospital discharge . However , evidence show optimal interval patient ongoing risk postoperative complication review . Not infrequently , hospital discharge , cardiac surgery patient make unplanned hospital visit and/or require readmission 6-week wait outpatient review due surgery-related complication [ 1-3 ] . Whereas well establish 30-day mortality morbidity rate surgery excess corresponding in-hospital rate [ 4 ] , 42-day incidence postoperative complication outpatient review , know . In fact 30-day readmission mortality rate widely use indicator quality surgical care [ 5 , 6 ] , 30-day hospital readmission rate cardiac surgery high 49 % report [ 7 ] . It argue long interval hospital discharge first outpatient specialist review expose patient ongoing risk explain high rate surgery-related complication time . Postoperative programme incorporate cardiac surgery nurse home visit outpatient review report significant reduction hospital readmission [ 8 ] . Hospital readmission contribute significantly healthcare cost whilst compromise quality care [ 9 , 10 ] . As result strategy direct reduce 30-day adverse outcome readmission focus identification predictor readmission management [ 11-16 ] . The risk factor identify old age co-morbidities prevalent among patient undergo cardiac surgery current era ; even strong reason re-examine long-standing outpatient follow-up practice . The purpose prospective observational study assess burden postoperative mortality morbidity 6-week interval hospital discharge first plan outpatient review cardiac surgery . This data helpful determine current time follow-up review revise . The propose study , seek answer question provide scientific evidence support clinical practice . Study goal objective After hospital discharge , patient undergone cardiac surgery still develop complication impair recovery sometimes require unplanned visit accident emergency department , hospital admission . The main study goal define magnitude ongoing postoperative complication suffer discharged cardiac surgery patient first plan review . Study design The study prospective observational study involve administer questionnaire consecutive adult patient undergone coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery institution 6-month period . Methodology On admission surgery , eligible participant approach provide study information . Prior discharge surgery , prospective participant consent give study questionnaire take home complete spouse/carer . Preoperative peri-operative data collect use standard cardiothoracic surgery electronic database programme ( Patient Analysis Tracking System ) , routine investigator ' institution . In addition , post discharge data relate plan unplanned hospital attendance and/or admission , intervention General Practitioner/Practice nurse 6 week interval first plan specialist review , shall prospectively collect use study questionnaire . Statistical analyse The data obtain study questionnaire link peri-operative data cardiothoracic database , manage dedicate specially trained staff . The database password-protected access data restrict . The data anonymised variable cod statistical analysis . The analysis include determination rate different complication impact postoperative recovery . The timing complications/intervention represent frequency plot . Results The study finding discuss local international scientific meeting publish specialty journal . The result use generate hypothesis support application randomise clinical trial .</detailed_description>
