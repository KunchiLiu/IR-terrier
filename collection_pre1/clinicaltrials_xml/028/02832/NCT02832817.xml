	<brief_summary>Hypoxemia frequent situation clinical practice , particularly intensive care unit perioperative . The mortality morbidity increase cardiovascular reason , due hypoxia report several time . It therefore important detect hypoxemia early accuracy . The objective correct cause quickly thus avoid minimize complication . In addition risk associate hypoxemia , monitor Arterial Oxygen Saturation also avoid adverse effect associate hyperoxia . Indeed oxygen lead formation free radical , physiological condition regulate antioxidant mechanism . However , anesthesiology , common find pathological situation ( acute respiratory distress syndrome , shock , prolong inflammatory state ) regulatory mechanism overwhelm . Oxygen administration supra-physiological concentration lead formation excessive free radical , aggravate exist injury ( include lung ) . Oxygen therapy fully-fledged treatment require monitoring effectiveness tolerance . Currently , standard method assess oxygenation arterial blood gas analysis Arterial Oxygen Saturation . Its cost need arterial blood sample allow regular monitoring . Clinical evaluation hypoxia completely unreliable . third method : monitoring device measure Arterial Pulsed Oxygen Saturation , call `` pulse oximeter . '' Pulse oximeter become integral mandatory part standard monitoring . It measurement Arterial Pulsed Oxygen Saturation , suppose reflect Arterial Oxygen Saturation , clinicians guide therapeutic attitude optimize oxygenation improve prognosis patient . So pulse oximetry method consider reliable especially non-invasive . It less expensive require blood sampling . These quality explain device easily use anesthesia , intensive care emergency situation . However , several study demonstrate inaccuracy Arterial Pulsed Oxygen Saturation frequent situation resuscitation ( shock , sepsis , dark skin type ) . Thus , necessary objectify benefit limitation pulse oximetry optimize use , especially situation high risk , discrepancy value measure pulse oximetry measurement arterial blood saturation oxygen gas detrimental . It exist several pulse oximetry device , whose accuracy seem unequal , necessitates comparative study .</brief_summary>
