	<brief_title>Effectiveness Intensive Weight Loss Program Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calculating sample size : The primary endpoint reduction final apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) respect baseline . Assuming alpha level 0.05 bilateral approach 80 % statistical power , investigator estimate final sample size 42 patient require detect 15 point difference AHI intervention control group ( clinically relevant difference ) , standard deviation 15 ( visit 9 ) accounting 25 % rate attrition . Balanced group expect . Lifestyle Change Program : This consist 3-month long first stage intensive diet progressive exercise visit nutritionist every 15 day . A second stage last completion one year , diet progressively high calorie , intense exercise , appointment space apart alternatively individual group visit . Diet First stage : 12 week 1. first 15 day : Very low calorie diet . A diet low calorie start ( 600-800 kilocalorie ( Kcal ) , base gender level physical activity ) low calorie shake . Supplementing diet herbal teas sugar-free beverage allow . 2 . Up week 12 : 1200 Kcal diet low calorie shake replace even meal . Exercising begin . At visit nutritionist provide advice diet lifestyle , special emphasis diet exercise . Visits nutritionist every 15 day . The first two group visit afterwards individual visit alternate group visit every 15 day ( see chart ) . On alternate week nurse phone patient remind diet 's basic guideline . Every session last 60 90 minute conduct nutritionist . The subject ask keep 3 day log eat start study visit order estimate nutrient intake . Every patient provide information entire program different group individual session nutritionist . At visit participant weigh asked result test ketone urine week . The nutritionist follow compliance program monitor potential adverse event visit . Second stage : 12 week 1 year A 1200-1500 Kcal diet maintain , base gender level physical activity , without low calorie shake . Calorie intake base Mediterranean diet , recommend maximum fat intake 30 % high consumption fruit , vegetable , poultry , fish , lean meat legume , accordance recommendation American Dietetic Association . Visits nutritionist take place monthly third sixth month every 3 month sixth 12th month , individual visit alternate group visit ( see chart ) . They also receive phone call every month , alternate visit , make company supply CPAP equipment . Exercise The following exercise program recommend : 1 . Walk briskly least 50-60 minute time , least 3 time per week , ideally 5 day week . Exercising increase gradually , start 10 minute period , repeat day gradually increase tolerated patient . Heart rate use monitor exercise intensity , recommend aerobic exercise perform 70-80 % maximum heart rate . ( Lung ( 2014 ) 192:175-184 ) . 2 . Every workout session consist stretch , 5-10 ' warm ( 50-60 % maximum heart rate ( HR ) ) , 40-50 ' aerobic exercise perform 70-80 % maximum HR 5-10 ' cool ( 50-60 % maximum HR ) . The table stretch perform exercise give write . The patient receive information perform exercise everything related group training session start program . 3 . To encourage exercise , chance perform least week guide group , patient 's town residence , offer . Follow : 1 . On visit nutritionist , addition data regard adherence diet , data regard adherence exercise program record : number session minutes/week . 2 . During group session , nurse charge study respond question may arise concern development exercise program . 3 . Patients smart phone also able record activity use app ( Endomondo ) , nurse nutritionist able access ( see section variable ) . In addition track exercise history , patient able see patient study opt voluntarily choose option . If musculoskeletal complaint deem relevant occur course exercise program , Rehabilitation Services attend patient . The pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) use assessment . A VAS score equal great 4 ( moderate pain ) would require assessment make Rehabilitation Services . Assessment exercise capacity : 1 To measure response exercise exercise tolerance test perform : six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , evaluate use reference value obese individual . It conduct start program 3 12 month . Sleep habit Subjects remind need sleep enough hour keep regular sleep schedule . Sleep hygiene guideline provide write . Control group : They manage accord usual recommendation : give diet exercise plan write , one commonly use Dietetics Unit , establish Dietetics Unit accord patient age level activity , without assessment additional visit Dietetics Unit . Visits Sleep Disorders Unit schedule coincide assessment 3 12 month , intervention group . Criteria withdrawal study : - occurrence osteoarticular pain prevents patient continue exercise - patient 's continued refusal follow recommend guideline RECRUITMENT PERIOD : Potential candidate select among patient follow doctor nurse CPAP treatment . All potential candidate invite participate study consecutive order require number patient reach . MONITORING PERIOD : All patient complete one year monitoring . If adverse effect occur monitor period , record discontinuation protocol assess . Diet-related adverse effect expect patient follow closely nutritionist . In event exercise-related osteoarticular pain occur , Rehabilitation Services ass patient determine whether exercise modify discontinue . ETHICAL ISSUES : The study conduct accordance principle Declaration Helsinki , well Data Protection Act ( Law 15/1999 ) . All patient ask provide informed consent , accordance rule Ethics Committee institution . Since patient receive CPAP treatment , ethical concern evaluate effectiveness alternative treatment principle less effective CPAP , patient severe OSAS . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : In order evaluate effectiveness change lifestyle ( diet exercise ) obese patient OSAS , investigator first perform descriptive analysis demographic variable baseline characteristic accord number case percentages qualitative variable investigator use measure central tendency ( mean , median ) dispersion ( standard deviation interquartile range ) quantitative variable . In order answer primary secondary objective study , investigator run inferential analysis compare data baseline , 3 month one year two treatment group . Tests independent sample use every case ( control experimental group ) . Either chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use , appropriate , compare categorical variable Student 's T-test use compare continuous variable ; variable study meet condition applicability parametric test , non-parametric alternative , Mann Whitney U test , use . An estimate treatment effect answer primary secondary endpoint obtain confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) difference mean percentage , appropriate . Efficacy assessment base analysis per protocol population ( PP ) intention-to-treat ( ITT ) , ITT population main analysis . For population analysis use ITT , miss data fill sensitivity analysis conduct one method imputation use . The PP population determine accordance compliance visit well diet exercise . A safety assessment make identify adverse effect consider significant due frequency severity . In case significance level use 5 % ( Î±=0.05 ) bilateral approach . The statistical software use analysis International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Statistics 21 .</detailed_description>
