	<brief_summary>Background Despite advance research , moment , various point related physiology gestation etiology severe disease develop course remain unknown . One aspects behavior biomarkers ( triglyceride , prolactin , glucose cholesterol ) pregnancy , experience gradual increase level reach peak hypertriglyceridemia , day delivery . Several study report biomarkers experience high elevation diabetic obese pregnant woman woman suffer preeclampsia . The description behavior different population pregnant woman ( healthy woman woman risk ) would identify relation alteration occur frequently pregnancy . Objective The aim study develop multi-paradigm biological model system determine triglyceride , prolactin , glucose cholesterol level pregnancy relation lactogenesis healthy risk pregnant woman . Methods A prospective cohort study take place woman pregnancy lactation . Participating woman divide two group . One group integrate healthy woman group pregnant woman risk medical history . The personal , family detail medical history collect group . A study variables influence level mention biomarkers ( triglyceride , cholesterol , glucose prolactin ) do . The universe consist 4,300 woman , constitute historical average delivery semester city Granada ( Spain ) . The sample collection make medical office 's pregnancy control Granada 's hospital , respective health center second half 2015 . The sample stratify probabilistic . Peculiarities pregnant woman take account calculate size study sample . This sample make 224 woman comply inclusion criterion sign informed consent . To achieve project objective organization comprise six theoretical practical phase enable scientific development project . During first phase , technical administrative preparation project construct . Thereafter , work divide two action area encompass collection data modeling . The creation biological multi-paradigm computer simulation model level biomarkers different month pregnancy various pathology pregnant woman effective know risk involve high level lipids mother baby .</brief_summary>
