	<brief_summary>Aims : To compare rate hypotension patient malignancy-related ascites undergo abdominal paracentesis without prophylactic intravenous albumin infusion Methodology : Patients symptomatic ascites secondary underlying malignancy admit medical oncology inpatient service require abdominal paracentesis enrol . Patients know portal hypertension base SAAG ( &gt; 11.1 mmol/L ) exclude . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 two group . During drainage ascites fluid , one group receive intravenous albumin infusion ( 50 ml/Litre ascitic fluid drain ) , whereas group receive intravenous albumin infusion . Baseline parameter along routine 4 hourly monitoring blood pressure do . Episodes hypotension ( fall SBP &gt; 20 mmHg ) compare two group significance test use chi-square test . Clinical significance : Ascites often occur set advanced malignancy drainage ascites proven provide symptomatic relief patient population relatively short life expectancy . The use intravenous albumin infusion loosely extrapolated study patient liver cirrhosis undergo abdominal paracentesis . To date , standard guideline guide practice study look use intravenous albumin population . As mechanisms ascites different different malignancy , indication intravenous albumin uncertain perhaps unnecessary setting . We hope understand rate hypotension abdominal paracentesis population generate systematic data guide clinical practice area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Intravenous Albumin Replacement During Abdominal Paracentesis Patients With Malignancy Related Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Introduction : Therapeutic paracentesis first line treatment patient symptomatic malignant ascites . The practice intravenous albumin infusion abdominal paracentesis come evidence patient liver cirrhosis . A meta-analysis seventeen randomise trial evaluate patient receive albumin versus alternative treatment large volume paracentesis find albumin reduce incidence post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction , hyponatraemia mortality ( Bernardi M , 2012 ) . The mechanisms ascites patient cirrhosis drive portal hypertension . Portal hypertension bring systemic vasodilation hyperdynamic circulation eventually contribute functional biochemical change lead ascites ( Gines . P , 1997 ) . In contrast , cause ascites patient malignancy usually multi-factorial . It occur commonly several tumour include malignancy ovary , breast , colon , lung , pancreas liver . In cancer type , mechanism lead malignancy-related ascites may different . Peritoneal carcinomatosis major cause malignancy-related ascites . Other cause include massive liver metastasis cause portal hypertension , chronic hypoalbuminaemia , hepatocellular carcinoma , chylous ascites lymphoma Budd-Chiari syndrome due occlusion hepatic vein ( Runyon BA , 1988 ) . In patient cancer , aside develop ascites result portal hypertension , benefit intravenous albumin infusion large volume paracentesis uncertain , present . Locally , current clinical practice infusion intravenous albumin abdominal paracentesis patient malignancy-related ascites regardless cause . The drawback approach include expose patient risk anaphylaxis increase financial cost ( 50 ml 20 % Albumin cost $ 42 ) . Granted potential harm albumin infusion rare , burden proof show intervention work hold introduce . To date , study specifically examine role intravenous albumin infusion population . In set advanced cancer life expectancy limit , clinically relevant benefit albumin infusion would reduce rate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction . Through pilot study , hope evaluate effectiveness IV albumin reduce rate hypotension , thereby guide clinical practice area . Rationale justification Study : Hypothesis : Intravenous albumin infusion abdominal paracentesis prevent hypotension patient malignancy-related ascites without portal hypertension . Rationale Study Purpose : Three significant outcome proven use intravenous albumin large volume paracentesis patient cirrhosis . These prevention hypotension , prevention hyponatraemia survival benefit . Ascites set patient malignancy usually occur advanced stage , meaningful outcome would prevention hypotension . At present , current clinical practice locally extrapolated study patient cirrhosis , physician would opt administer IV albumin every litre ascitic fluid drain . We propose study compare rate hypotension patient receive IV albumin . In study , randomise patient know history cancer admit symptomatic ascites two group . Both group patient undergo insertion abdominal drain symptomatic relief . Group 1 receive intravenous albumin Group 2 . Rationale Doses Selected : In Group 1 , 50 ml 20 % intravenous albumin give every litre ascitic fluid drain current local preparation practice . Rationale Study Population : Replacement intravenous albumin establish patient ascites drainage patient liver cirrhosis . It show benefit patient malignancy . Rationale Study Design : There previous study patient population . This prospective pilot randomise study order compare rate hypotension two group .</detailed_description>
