	<criteria>Subjects must histologically determine B cell NHL relapse primary refractory initial therapy . Follicular Lymphoma grade Marginal zone lymphoma ( extranodal , nodal , splenic ) . Patients gastric MALT must progress H. Pylori therapy radiation . Patients splenic MZL must prior splenectomy . At least 1 prior line chemoimmunotherapy primary refractory relapse one year . Subjects respond initial therapy great one year must least 2 prior line therapy include one line chemoimmunotherapy include antiCD20 monoclonal antibody Measurable disease previously irradiate PETCT least 1.5cm , Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( see Appendix A ) Participants must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥750/mcL platelets ≥75,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal 5 X ULN due lymphoma infiltration creatinine 2.0 X ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level 2.0 X ULN . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants chemotherapy within 3 week , rituximab obinutuzumab within 4 week , radioimmunotherapy within 6 week prior enter study , recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Subjects actively progress within window recover toxicity prior therapy also eligible . Autologous stem cell transplantation within 12 week prior study entry Prior allogeneic transplant Therapeutic dose corticosteroid within 14 day prior study entry , define &gt; 20mg/day pf prednisone , equivalent . Topical and/or inhale steroid permit . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition blinatumomab Subjects know HIV infection Pregnant lactating subject . Chronic infection hepatitis B hepatitis C virus History current relevant CNS pathology epilepsy , seizure , paresis , aphasia , apoplexia , severe brain injury , cerebellar disease , organic brain syndrome , psychosis Prior history another malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ cervical breast cancer , localize prostate cancer ) unless disease free least one year felt low risk relapse treat physician . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
