	<brief_summary>Henoch-Sch√∂nlein ( HS ) purpura common cause renal glomerular injury child . This condition responsible 10-15 % glomerulonephritis child . The outcome generally favorable , 5 % patient develop kidney failure . The outcome patient kidney biopsy less favorable 7-50 % progress chronic renal failure . Prevalence HS difficult determine literature . Annual incidence estimate 6.1 / 100,000 child Netherlands 20.4 / 100 000 child United Kingdom . The proportion child HS develop renal disease difficult determine number report literature variable depend greatly type reporting center , whether specialized pediatric nephrology . Thus proportion renal disease vary 20 % 100 % child HS . The treatment HS nephropathy ( HSN ) usually depend severity histological lesion histological classification discuss currently consensus . Randomized study scarce often allow draw clear conclusion . A meta-analysis suggest positive effect corticosteroid renal prognosis severe form study definition renal disease heterogeneous . The classification HSN recognize International Study Group Kidney Disease Childhood ( ISKDC ) following : grade I : minimal glomerula abnormality , grade II : pure proliferation , grade III : crescents/ segmental lesion &lt; 50 % , grade IV : crescents/ segmental lesion 50 75 % , grade V : crescents/ segmental lesion &gt; 75 % , grade VI : pseudomesangiocapillary . However , classification question ignores significant histological lesion interstitial fibrosis , tubular lesion , glomerular interstitial inflammation , appearance crescent ( segmental totally encompass glomerulus , fibrous cellular ) , segmental sclerosis , fibrosis arteriolar appearance immunofluorescence . There currently consensus criterion indicate initiation corticosteroid therapy whether oral intra venous bolus . Some patient severe clinical / histological initial presentation evolve remission spontaneously others moderate initial symptom evolve later kidney failure . The management therefore heterogeneous . In France , center perform kidney biopsy almost always start treatment ( day follow start treatment ) , center 's treatment decision base biology result glomerular disease , kidney biopsy perform possibly second time case failure initial treatment . Principal objective study : assessment interest long term outcome perform early kidney biopsy ( establishment treatment within 15 day start treatment ) child HSN compare kidney biopsy perform later ( depend response initial therapy ) perform . Secondary objective : assessment impact early kidney biopsy ( establishment treatment within 15 day start treatment ) initial treatment HSN : modify treatment start right ( decided clinical biological criterion ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If past HSN could consider rather benign disease require specific active treatment , study evaluate long-term outcome show risk progression Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) lead recommend use corticosteroid immunosuppressor even rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis form ( 24,25 ) . Unfortunately clinical study scarce , often patient uncontrolled ( 17,26,27 ) . However , efficacy methylprednisolone pulse follow oral steroid suggest several study , study conduct Hospital Necker , prospective patient receive pulse methylprednisolone compare historical cohort center ( 28 ) control arm randomize control trial ( 29 ) , study patient receive combination several immunosuppressive drug ( 30-32 ) . Thus , current French way manage severe HSN give methylprednisolone pulse follow oral steroid . Anti-proteinuric medication initially mild form sequelae . Immunosuppressor add steroid form respond well initial corticosteroid therapy . If therapy use pediatric team , practice kidney biopsy ( KB ) vary one center another . Some team routinely perform KB start steroid therapy ( adapt treatment result ) , others first establish treatment perform KB evolution expect . This second approach reduces number KB since patient favorable outcome never biopsied . The question two attitude best . Do biopsied patient good prognosis 5 year ( lesion well evaluate comparison clinical evaluation , diagnosis confirm , despite risk take perform KB , excess treatment ) biopsied initial period ( possible error assess severity injury ) , difference ( treatment whether KB perform , clinical criterion prevail therapeutic decision histological criterion , KB may falsely reassure may lead stop treatment early ( sample problem ) ) . The aim study answer question , improve patient care identify effective strategy improve long term prognosis , standardize practice make randomize control trial easier drive future .</detailed_description>
