	<brief_summary>Lean tissue intracellular triglyceride ( ICTG ) accretion important marker lean tissue lipotoxicity significantly contribute development type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . The mechanisms lead excess exposure lean tissue fatty acid involve metabolic dysfunction adipose tissue lean tissue . Understanding role white brown adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction particularly important predicting , prevent treat T2D many associate cardiovascular complication . A recent breakthrough demonstration acute oral administration β3 adrenergic agonist , mirabegron ( 200 mg ) , significantly increase BAT glucose uptake healthy individual . This suggest mirabegron could use pharmacological tool selectively activate BAT metabolism part mechanistic study BAT . It also suggest mirabegron could use pharmacologically chronic activation BAT clinical trial treat obesity T2D . However , outstanding issue regard use mirabegron activate BAT . First , direct comparison effect acute cold vs. mirabegron BAT metabolism . Second , demonstration effect mirabegron BAT oxidative metabolism since glucose uptake surrogate BAT energy expenditure . Third , acute administration mirabegron lead significant increase blood pressure cardiac work , suggest may also enhance energy expenditure organs addition BAT , thus confound role BAT energy homeostasis . Therefore , much remain known effect mirabegron BAT cardiac energy metabolism drug use selective activator BAT oxidative metabolism . The purpose study directly compare BAT oxidative metabolism cold vs. β3-adrenergic agonist stimulation lean healthy individual . The investigator hypothesize acute oral administration lower dose mirabegron ( 50 mg ) result increase BAT oxidative metabolism whole-body energy expenditure , similar extent cold exposure , without influence cardiovascular response previously see high dose ( 200 mg ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first step study direct comparison mirabegron ( protocol A ) vs. cold-induced ( protocol B ) BAT metabolic activation use 11C-acetate measure BAT metabolic activity . The principle method measurement tissue fast disappearance 11C , marker tissue 11CO2 production . This fast tissue 11C clearance thus give index tissue oxidative metabolism . Ten healthy , non obese men undergo two identical 5h procedure BAT metabolism stimulate β3-agonist ( mirabegron 50mg ) use cold exposure , random order . The investigator receive approval Health Canada use mirabegron part metabolic investigation . In brief , baseline blood sample indirect calorimetry perform time -60 -30 min follow i.v . injection 11C-acetate 30 min dynamic PET/CT scanning room temperature protocol A B. Mirabegron administer orally time 0 protocol A whereas acute cold exposure protocol use water-conditioned cooling suit apply time 120 300 min protocol B . At time 210 min ( i.e . Tmax plasma mirabegron level 90 min onset cold exposure ) , i.v . injection 11C-acetate repeat follow 30 min dynamic PET/CT scanning . I.v . injection 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18FDG ) perform time 270 min , follow 30 min dynamic PET/CT scan determine BAT net glucose uptake whole-body PET/CT scan determine BAT volume metabolic activity organ-specific glucose partitioning .</detailed_description>
