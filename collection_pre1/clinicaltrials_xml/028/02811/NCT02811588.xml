There robust scientific evidence non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) therapy effective option COPD patient hospitalize acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary acute disease exacerbation . More recently , NIV show significantly improve survival quality life COPD patient chronic stable hypercapnic disease . These data represent important advance field , indicate usage NIV patient chronic stable hypercapnic COPD increase . Such increase would expect improve patient outcomes beneficial impact significant healthcare burden incur patient . However , proportion stable COPD patient chronic hypercapnia unknown . In addition , use NIV home treat COPD patient hypercapnic ( type 2 ) respiratory failure often consider previously paucity data regard NIV usage pattern time set .</brief_summary>
