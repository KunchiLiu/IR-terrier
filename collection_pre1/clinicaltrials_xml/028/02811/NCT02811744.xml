	<brief_summary>Our propose study aim use 11C-acetate PET/CT preliminarily test validate method image astrocyte activation early indicator neuroinflammation Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 11C-Acetate PET/CT show quantify astrocyte activation vivo , report evaluate potential AD . We propose test 11C-Acetate PET/CT marker astrocyte activation associate pathologic amyloid deposition AD . We compare bind subject early stage AD healthy control . Further , investigate correlation amyloid acetate binding . If find increase astrocyte activation response cerebral amyloid show group difference brain acetate uptake disease control strong correlation acetate amyloid PET/CT binding . Validating neuroinflammation marker AD ultimately may guide therapeutic modulation beneficial damaging neuroinflammation slow disease progression , well provide new insight AD pathophysiology .</brief_summary>
