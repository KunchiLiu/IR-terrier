	<brief_title>Predicting Treatment Response Memantine Autism Using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) behaviorally define complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterize early childhood onset mark deficiency social communication skill presence restrictive , repetitive behavior . Its phenotypic heterogeneity make study ASD treatment challenge task . Currently , two FDA approve drug , risperidone aripiprazole , available treat ASD manage irritability associate disorder . None show conclusive benefit core feature social communication deficit . Research indicate disrupt balance excitation ( glutamate ) inhibition ( gamma amino-butyric acid , GABA ) likely one underlie mechanism ASD . This hypothesis support number magnetic resonance spectroscopy study report excess glutamatergic excitation and/or reduction GABAergic inhibition observe different brain region include limbic system anterior cingulate cortex . Similar finding also report post mortem study ASD brain.Thus , expect drug target imbalance could beneficial . For example , GABAB agonist , arbaclofen , test ASD reason show promising result large trial fail show improvement primary endpoint lethargy social withdrawal . Memantine , moderate affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , know improve communication patient Alzheimer 's disease FDA approve treatment disease . Examination efficacy memantine treat ASD also driven excitatory ( glutamate ) - inhibitory ( gamma amino-butyric acid , GABA ) imbalance hypothesis ASD pathology . Memantine bind glutamatergic NMDA receptor attenuate glutamatergic excitation . This reduction excessive glutamatergic activation think decrease `` noise '' neural network system facilitate learn memory . A small study show effectiveness memantine treatment social communication aspect ASD spectrum disorder ( ASD ) well . However , one large clinical trial use memantine ASD report failure respond . These discrepancy result could possibly due heterogeneity excitatory-inhibitory imbalance ASD patient thereby cause variation response . In scenario , biomarker predict individual 's treatment response would invaluable . MR Spectroscopy non-invasive tool use examine biochemical profile brain tissue associate different psychiatric neurological condition include ASD . Specifically , 1H-MRS study ASD demonstrate excitatory-inhibitory imbalance various cortical subcortical region brain , find also report post mortem brain tissue study . The use technique determine Glutamate/GABA concentration certain region brain predict response treatment memantine would innovative breakthrough provide effective individualized treatment patient since little research do explore possibility . A similar approach adopt recent ongoing study use proton MR spectroscopy map change glutamate GABA follow use riluzole ASD . Riluzole drug commonly use amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) glutamate antagonist work block presynaptic glutamate release noncompetitive inhibition NMDA receptor . However , riluzole clinically use treatment ASD . To knowledge , one study far ( apart ongoing study mention ) examine effect riluzole ASD , adjunct risperidone . The primary outcome Ghaleiha et al . study irritability repetitive motor behavior core social communication deficit present proposal . The purpose riluzole MR spectroscopy study proof principle effect spectroscopy base glutamate antagonistic effect . By contrast , memantine , study present proposal , document evidence small study beneficial treat social communication deficit associate ASD clinical setting , despite failure large trial . The investigator 's lab previously utilized MR spectroscopy technique map different compound group 14 subject ASD identify glutamate GABA alteration cerebellum , discover relationship cerebrocerebellar connectivity behavioral outcome individual ASD . Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : The investigator propose pilot , exploratory , clinical follow-on study use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) examine whether follow measure use predict treatment response memantine ASD : 1 . Glx and/or GABA Glx/GABA ratio anterior cingulate cortex , 2 . Glx level dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cerebellum 3 . Markers neuronal integrity , N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) , myo-inositol , choline creatine/phosphocreatine level anterior cingulate , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cerebellum Specific Aim 2 : To examine whether rest state functional connectivity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cerebellum , hold predictive value treatment response memantine ASD . The anterior cingulate cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cerebellum choose region interest ( ROIs ) due know atypical glutamate GABAergic profile region associate ASD . The approach limit select ROIs adopt order ensure patient comfort image process reduce time spent scanner . Since altered level marker neuronal integrity , NAA , choline , creatine/phosphocreatine myoinositol also report ASD , mapping biochemicals well order explore effect treatment response . Resting state functional connectivity also analyze possible association treatment outcome prediction since mention , previous study investigator 's show link alteration rest state cerebrocerebellar connectivity , excitatory-inhibitory ratio cerebellum behavioral outcome ASD use MR spectroscopy .</detailed_description>
