	<brief_summary>A total 40 % neurodevelopmental difficulty report premature infant le 32 week age . The Epipage1 study report decrease prevalence cerebral palsy ( 9-6 % ) high prevalence specific cognitive neurological difficulty increase school failure . Neurocognitive difficulty numerous : visuospatial dyspraxia , language disorder , executive function disorder well attention behaviour disorder . Developmental language disorder rarely report literature . This originally prompt request i.e . PHRC 2010 National Multicenter : LAMOPRESCO . For past 3 year protocol study language development child bear prematurely , age 3 half year free cerebral palsy , particular impact short rehabilitation period , precise , early stage , protocolized fundamental sensorimotor language . The principal assessment criterion measurement phonology , cornerstone oral write language human . The aim present project analysis effect specific language stimulation learn write language . The hypothesis specific work modify various aspect child 's language , age 3 4 , alters development phonological skill sustainable way . The acquisition read skill basically dependent quality phonological component . The randomized study child 8 year age cohort 150 child ( LAMOPRESCO ) permit confirm refute hypothesis . These increase difficulty report regard language understand 3 15 year old child . It initial difficulty weakness , moreover constitute oral language , prevent use development neural network , become complex require oral write language .
