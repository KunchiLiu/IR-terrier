	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia ( loss muscle mass function ) observe age result multiple factor ( age , activity , inflammatory factor , nutritional status ... ) . It deeply impact physical performance basal metabolism , induces cardiovascular disorder , dyslipidemia , diabetes . Sarcopenia appear like independent factor decrease quality life , exacerbate toxicity chemotherapy increase mortality gastrointestinal cancer . However , study demonstrate impact postoperative course digestive oncology . The search sarcopenia , complementary nutritional status , source great interest 62 ongoing project United States . The first objective study evaluate impact preoperative sarcopenia 30-days morbidity mortality patient operate poor prognosis gastrointestinal cancer ( liver pancreas ) . The second objective evaluate impact preoperative sarcopenia long term outcome ( 12 month ) patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In interventional , intent-to-treat , single-center cohort , prospective study , sarcopenia evaluate decrease muscle surface ( assessed CT-Scan ) associate decrease muscle strength ( assessed hand gauge ) . Preoperative evaluation also include nutritional status physical examination laboratory test , many nutritional questionnaire . The data ( include sarcopenia , laboratory test nutritional evaluation ) collect 7 day , 30 day 12 month , well morbidity mortality . Statistical test might evaluate sarcopenia may independent factor morbidity mortality among patient .</detailed_description>
