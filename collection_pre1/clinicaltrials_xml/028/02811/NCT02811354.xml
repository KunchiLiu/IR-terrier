	<brief_summary>Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) highly specific effective biomarker detection EGFR mutation status . We hypothesise AZD9291 efficacious patient EGFR sensitize mutation T790M detect plasma ctDNA . This prospective , open label , multi-centre single arm phase II study assess efficacy safety AZD9291 monotherapy patient stage IIIB IV harbor sensitise EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion exon 21 L858R substitution mutation ) T790M progress follow prior treatment approve EGFR TKI . Approximately 106 subject enrol . All patient must document radiological progression EGFR-TKI treatment last treatment administer prior enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study AZD9291 Advanced Stage NSCLC With EGFR T790M Mutations Detected Plasma Ct-DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As T790M common mechanism acquire resistance EGFR TKI , EGFR TKIs target T790M develop . AZD9291 oral , potent , irreversible EGFR-TKI selective sensitizing ( EGFRm ) T790M resistance mutation significant selectivity margin wild-type EGFR . As result , AZD9291 effectively block EGFR signal EGFR single mutant cell activate EGFR mutation double mutant cell bear resistance T790M mutation . This prospective , open label , multi-centre single arm phase II study assess efficacy safety AZD9291 monotherapy patient stage IIIB IV harbor sensitise EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion exon 21 L858R substitution mutation ) T790M progress follow prior treatment approve EGFR TKI . Approximately 108 subject enrol . All patient must document radiological progression EGFR-TKI treatment last treatment administer prior enrol study . Target patient population : Patients &gt; 18 year age , diagnosis locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC amenable curative surgery radiotherapy document activate EGFR mutation ( exon 19 deletion exon 21 L858R substitution mutation ) time initial diagnosis , radiological disease progression follow either 1st line EGFR TKI treatment OR follow prior therapy EGFR TKI platinum-based doublet chemotherapy . Plasma sample must harbour EGFR mutation know associated EGFR TKI sensitivity ( exon 19 deletion , L858R well presence T790M central lab test plasma sample take confirmation disease progression recent treatment regimen . Patients must normal organ bone marrow function ECOG PS 0-2 . Treatment regimen : Patient treat AZD9291 start dose 80mg day patient completes study , withdraw study closure study . A cycle treatment define 28 day daily AZD9291 treatment . Patients may continue receive AZD9291 objective disease progression ( determined RECIST 1.1 ) subject longer receive clinical benefit Investigator 's opinion .</detailed_description>
