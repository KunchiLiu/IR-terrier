	<brief_summary>The primary objective study investigate effect inhale budesonide incidence AMS . The primary study question ask : 1 . Does inhale budesonide reduce incidence AMS rapid active ascent 4559 ? In addition , secondary study question ask : 1 . Does inhale budesonide reduce severity AMS rapid active ascent 4559 ? 2 . Are effect inhale budesonide AMS incidence severity relate plasma concentration ? Study medication Inhaled budesonide 2 different concentration ( 2 x 200 µg , 2 x 800 µg ) versus placebo Study design - Prospective , control , single-center study 51 healthy volunteer 4559 [ Capanna Regina Margherita ( Margherita Hut ) , Italy ] - With regard intervention ( inhaled budesonide ) double-blinded randomized</brief_summary>

The high-altitude part take place Capanna Regina Margherita ( Margherita Hut , Italy ) 4559 m. Interventions investigation - Ascend Alagna ( 1130 , Italy ) Margherita Hut ( 4559 ) less 24 h , precede overnight stay 3611 ( Gnifetti Hut , Italy ) . - Stay Margherita Hut 48 hour - Randomized inhalation budesonide two different concentration ( 2 x 200 µg 2 x 800 µg , respectively ) placebo - Assessment incidence severity acute mountain sickness use 2 internationally standardize well establish questionnaire - Venous ( capillary ) blood drawing - Pulmonary function test - Transthoracic echocardiography assess pulmonary artery systolic pressure Number volume blood drawing For study venous blood sample ( volume : 20 ml ) draw 5 different time point ( 5 x 20 ml = 100 ml ) . Together blood draw pre-investigation ( 20 ml ) total blood volume 120 ml take . At time point capillary blood sample ( 1 ml ) take ear lobe blood gas analysis ( 5 x 1 ml = 5 ml total ) . Observational period The study start approval ethic committee responsible study ( ethic committee Paracelsus Medical University ) . If study approve perform July 2016 .</detailed_description>
