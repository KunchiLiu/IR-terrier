Where research focus immunosuppression infection , investigator hypothesize due poor homeostatic capacity necessary use immunosuppressive drug , renal transplant recipient much susceptible poor dietary habit exposure potentially toxic contaminant people general population , contributes accelerate function loss graft excess risk premature mortality , contribute poor long-term result . To investigate one part overarch hypothesis , investigator write project around specific topic relation dietary acid load , ammoniagenesis potential influence blood pressure . The investigator use project build biobank cohort test additional hypothesis relation diet , contaminant development graft failure occurrence mortality . The investigator also include 300 healthy control compare diet , contaminant exposure biomarkers renal transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
