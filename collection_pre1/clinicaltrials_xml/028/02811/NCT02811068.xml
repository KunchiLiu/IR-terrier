	<brief_summary>HPV vaccine include national immunisation schedule since 2008 , firstly Cervarix vaccine protect two HPV type 2012 Gardasil vaccine offer protection two HPV type . This study ass whether booster dos indicate protect female throughout lifetime vaccination offer early adolescence provide follow cohort previous study female adolescent vaccinate 5-7 year ago .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since September 2008 , Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine offer part UK national immunisation schedule adolescent female , first three dos bivalent vaccine ( Cervarix ) cover two common strain ( HPV16 18 ) . Subsequently quadrivalent vaccine give 2012 ( Gardasil ) incorporate two HPV type ( HPV6 11 ) . Between 2009 2011 , National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium ( NVEC ) conduct randomised , observer-blinded parallel group study evaluate immunogenicity two HPV vaccine term humoral immune response vaccine non-vaccine incorporated HPV genotype . The investigator plan approach participant original study part follow study ass duration humoral immune response elicit HPV vaccine ; specifically , compare breadth magnitude antibody responses vaccine non-vaccine incorporated genotype 5.7-6.8years first dose vaccine . Long-term follow study conduct 9.4 year post vaccination example multicentre double-blinded trial evaluate long term efficacy Cervarix vaccine , demonstrate 95-100 % sustain efficacy incident infection CIN1+/2+ lesion whilst antibody titre see natural infection add confidence long term efficacy vaccine . The quadrivalent vaccine evaluate long term follow study example continuation Future II study 9 year post first dose , whereby ≥94 % sample seropositive type 6,11 16 60 % HPV18 accord cut-off negative serostatus value decide selection naïve seropositive serum . There also minimal difference titre compare month 18 48 , represent stable plateau seroprotective titre . There two study examine duration antibody responses non-vaccine genotype beyond 12 month : one compare antibody titer elicit HPV vaccine HPV31 HPV45 18-26 year old woman 24 month post first dose one describe HPV31 seropositivity 18-25 year old woman 48 month . This study therefore provide unique data age group HPV vaccination offer UK , term vaccine incorporate genotype limit number follow study evaluate 12-15 year old age group , well assess duration antibody responses non-vaccine type far less extensively study age group . A minimum antibody titre correlate HPV vaccine efficacy define ; , so-called correlate protection . For HPV16 HPV18 , part , due high level HPV antibody generate follow vaccination lack breakthrough infection vaccine trial . For non-vaccine genotype efficacy partial , information breadth , magnitude duration antibody specificity require correlate ( surrogate ) protection establish . There evidence suggest robust immunological memory study look booster dos HPV vaccine , could introduce UK programme ensure protection throughout woman 's sexual lifetime . For instance , follow study assess immunological response booster dose Cervarix seven year follow immunisation three dose schedule , strong memory B cell response persist vaccination , give rise significantly high GMTs observe follow first dose bivalent vaccine . A significant fold-increase GMTs also observe booster dose follow two dos quadrivalent vaccine , though GMTs high follow bivalent booster . This follow study begin address question long term durability HPV vaccine antibody response afford HPV vaccine target age group UK population therefore whether change need make current national schedule .</detailed_description>
