	<brief_summary>Several study demonstrate possibility outpatient management early discharge certain patient present acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , provide suitable structure place . The approach feature recent guideline acute PE European Society Cardiology , refer all-cause mortality risk assessment use Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index ( PESI ) score simplify PESI score ( sPESI ) . The sPESI take account demographic ( age ) , patient history ( cancer , cardiac respiratory disease ) , clinical data ( systolic blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation ) . Outpatient care offer low-risk patient , provide condition pertain start anticoagulant treatment follow-up home met . An alternative approach base list simple criterion develop one use HESTIA study . The main criterion include HESTIA rule consist absence follow : hemodynamic instability , need oxygen therapy , high-risk hemorrhage , renal liver failure , medical social condition require hospitalization . The investigator hereby propose compare two approach open-label , control randomize international trial blind adjudication endpoint . The main objective demonstrate , normotensive PE patient , strategy base HESTIA rule compare strategy base simplify PESI score least safe regard 30-day-rate adverse event ( recurrent VTE , major bleed death ) . The major secondary objective demonstrate , normotensive PE patient , strategy base HESTIA rule compare strategy base simplify PESI score effective : - As regard rate patient eventually manage outpatient . - As regard rate patient , theory , eligible outpatient care ,</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hospitalization Out-treatment ManagEment Patients With Pulmonary Embolism : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient admit Emergency Department participate centre diagnose PE eligible assess potential inclusion . Included patient randomize two group ( 1:1 ) stratify centre . Data record computerized case report form ( e-CRF ) enable randomization . The HESTIA group receive outpatient care proposal base HESTIA criterion . The sPESI group receive outpatient care proposal base simplify PESI score . Any reason management ( hospitalization outpatient treatment ) base recommendation explain documented e-CRF . Follow-up occur within 72 hour inclusion , 14 day , 1 month , 3 month group gather clinical event data ( recurrent VTE , major bleeding , death ) , treatment data , unscheduled hospitalization patient satisfaction assessment result . The major objective test HESTIA base strategy versus sPESI base strategy hierarchical approach : - step 1 : non-inferiority analysis rate adverse event , - yes , step 2 : superiority analysis rate patient manage outpatient , - yes , step3 : superiority analysis rate patient , theory , eligible outpatient care .</detailed_description>
