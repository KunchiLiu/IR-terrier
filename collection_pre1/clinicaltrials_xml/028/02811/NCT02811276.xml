	<brief_summary>In 19th century , researcher find difference energy content macronutrients ( protein , carbohydrate fat ) elicit different response amount calorie individual burn per day . It demonstrate protein metabolic advantage compare macronutrients ( carbohydrate fat ) . Since finding , researcher world start study diet differ macronutrient distribution could result different response energy metabolism . Diets high amount protein ( i.e . meat , egg , dairy product , grain ) become popular , study show people eat high quantity protein lose weight fat mass , maintain weight loss , burn calorie per day . The investigator hypothesize give high amount protein healthy woman increase amount calorie fat burn per day , increase satiety , improve health marker compare normal diet . The increased protein level achieve use nutrition supplement consist soy protein , yogurt honey . To test , investigator plan divide participant two group : one eat normal diet diet high amount protein one half day . After one month change group eat diet period time . During period consume diet ( 1.5 day ) , participant stay inside whole body calorimetry suite , similar hotel bedroom able inform precise way amount calorie participant burn burn fat . Additionally , meal participant answer questionnaire appetite sensation blood also collect analyze health marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact High Protein Diet Substrate Oxidation Energy Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate impact high protein diet ( achieve use high protein supplement ) versus standard diet substrate oxidation energy expenditure use state-of-the-art live-in whole body calorimetry unit ( WBCU ) . This study acute randomize , control , cross-over trial . Healthy woman ( n=24 ) receive run-in diet three day randomly allocate one follow group : 1 ) Control group receive eucaloric standard diet ( 55 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein , 30 % lipid ) ; 2 ) High-protein group : eucaloric high protein diet ( 35 % carbohydrate , 40 % protein , 25 % fat ) construct around soy protein-based meal replacement . The wash-out period approximately one month . While receive diet WBCU 32 hour , participant ' overall change energy metabolism include respiratory quotient assess . Additional assessment include metabolic blood marker ( glucose , insulin , lipid panel , peptide tyrosine-tyrosine , ghrelin , leptin , free glycerol , free fatty acid ) , appetite sensation ( hunger satiety ) . Body composition energy requirement assess baseline use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry indirect calorimetry , respectively . It expect high-protein diet increase lipid oxidation , energy expenditure , favorable change additional marker compare control group .</detailed_description>
