	<brief_summary>I recently publish significant association circulate gut bacteria-related metabolite lean skeletal muscle mass measure physical function older adult , evidence suggest role gut bacteria maintenance outcomes . To date , study aim identification association gut bacteria lean mass specific measure physical function yet report . Accordingly , over-arching hypothesis gut bacteria associate causatively involved mechanism underlie maintenance lean mass physical function older adult .

	<brief_title>Role Gut Microbiome Lean Mass Physical Function Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In old adult ( 70+ year ) , reduce lean body mass physical function associate increased disability , hospitalization , morbidity mortality . Because old adult fast grow global subpopulation , identification mechanism underlie maintenance lean mass physical function important address public health priority healthy age . Gut bacteria may involve mechanism underlie maintenance lean mass physical function . In support hypothesis , multiple publication I recently report significant association circulate gut bacteria-related metabolite outcome old adult . Accordingly , overarch hypothesis gut bacteria associate causatively involved mechanism underlie maintenance lean mass physical function older adult . To test hypothesis , I propose : characterize association fecal bacteria lean mass physical function ( AIM 1 ) , test causative role gut bacteria maintenance lean mass physical function colonize germ-free mice fecal bacteria old adult ( AIM 2 ) , examine potential mechanism link gut bacteria outcomes identify association gut bacteria serum metabolite lean mass physical function ( AIM 3 ) .</detailed_description>
