	<brief_summary>Sarcoma spread lung often treat surgery . Even surgery , patient cure die disease , probably small cancer cell present lung time surgery , see detect . It reason look well treatment . Giving chemotherapy surgery generally recommend significant side effect benefit proven . This study investigate new technique deliver chemotherapy directly lungs time surgery . Delivering chemotherapy directly lung could potentially kill microscopic cancer cell present lung time surgery , spar major organ body side effect chemotherapy . This technique call In Vivo Lung Perfusion ( IVLP ) . This Phase I , non-randomized , dose escalation study act pilot study large prospective , multicenter , control clinical trial . Patients bilateral disease one lung undergo IVLP lung remain untreated IVLP ( lung treat current standard care - either surgery radiation ) control lung . The patient undergo posterolateral thoracotomy . Lung metastases identify visualization palpation . After surgical isolation lung proximal control pulmonary artery vein , IVLP initiate . After 3 hour IVLP , lung metastasis remove usual fashion . Patients care post-surgery accord institutional standard . The patient follow 2 year . The primary endpoint safety . Secondary endpoint include additional safety endpoint efficacy .</brief_summary>
