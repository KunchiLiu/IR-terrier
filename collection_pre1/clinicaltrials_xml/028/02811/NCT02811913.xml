	<brief_summary>Stroke affect 795,000 Americans every year enormous impact well-being American Veterans 6,000 new stroke admission every year . Many stroke survivor live disability limit everyday function . One major consequence stroke loss sensation manifest inability perceive touch , temperature , pain limb movement . Lack sensation hinders full functional recovery . Current treatment sensory loss produce limited improvement achieve full recovery . Therefore , critical develop new therapy re-train sensory function . The investigator propose evaluate novel non-invasive brain stimulation treatment call repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . The effect technique motor deficit follow stroke study , however rTMS treatment sensory loss examine date . The investigator ' study examine first time rTMS sensory brain region improve sensory function chronic stroke survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can rTMS Enhance Somatosensory Recovery After Stroke ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sensory deficit present majority stroke survivor . Inability feel movement , touch pain impairs investigator ' ability interact environment diminish quality life . These sensory deficit significantly impair functional activity slow recovery rehabilitation . Currently available sensory rehabilitation technique partially restore sensory function . The main objective study test novel approach improve sensory function stroke use non-invasive brain stimulation . This pilot study measure immediate effect different repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) paradigm crossover single session design . The effect intervention measure clinical measure sensory motor function neurophysiological assessment sensory pathway . If concept demonstrate pilot study , follow lead investigation type , pilot provide foundation test efficacy long-term multi-session intervention combine rTMS peripherally direct therapy .</detailed_description>
