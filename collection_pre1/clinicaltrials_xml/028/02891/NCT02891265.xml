	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Intervention Within Fracture Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco use lead preventable death contribute 5 million estimate death per year globally.1 Nicotine highly addictive substance tobacco remain legal product , use intend , kill . The long term negative effect smoke well establish . Ten percent current former smoker live chronic disease . Among current smoker ill , prevalent condition chronic bronchitis , emphysema , myocardial infarction.2 Moreover complication due smoke orthopaedic perspective well establish . With respect orthopaedic trauma literature , smoke impairs osteoblastic function , propagate vasoconstriction result delay non -unions.3 Its use 3-6 fold increase risk intra- operative pulmonary complication , impairs wind healing4 , heal bone , soft tissue , lead flap necrosis . 4-7 Furthermore smoker twice likely develop infection 3.7 time likely develop osteomyelitis8 . Smoking cessation program essential achieve sustainable health care system . Health care cost smoker give age much 40 percent high non smoker . 9 The cost treatment tobacco relate illness British Columbia 2004 estimate 500 million CDN dollar . The total annual cost treatment condition related second hand smoke exposure North Carolina Minnesota 2006 alone estimate great 290 225 million US dollar respectively . 10 , 11 The role healthcare practitioner recognize paramount importance smoking cessation . These program rely Transtheoretical Model patient behavioral change . In order maximize intervention clinician provide counseling , motivation , education , monitoring , empathy personalize smoking cessation intervention program extend assistance follow-up12 . Multiple field medicine establish smoke cessation program either pre-operatively hospitalization . Randomized control trial ( RCTs ) hospitalize cardiac patient exhibit decreased rate non fatal infarction , re-operation , reduce risk rate mortality.13 A systematic review reveal 8 pre- operative RCTs perform date across multiple surgical discipline total 1156 enrol patient . Their strategy counsel follow vary . All 20 % loss follow limit maximum 12 month . However significant decrease post-operative complication cessation maintain 12 month follow up.14 Despite availability smoking cessation intervention , traditionally underutilized , part due frustration , lack clinician training organizational support , especially Orthopaedic Surgery12 . Only single randomize control trial within set acute fracture clinic publish date.15 This multicentred trial Sweden utilize standardize 6 week cessation program nicotine replacement therapy patient intervention group desire . It capture 18 % potential candidate limit 12 week follow . Long term cessation rate evaluate . The acute fracture clinic unique environment establish smoking cessation program order achieve primary prevention . Previously healthy patient face impact disability unique relationship base trust establish patient surgeon . Given negative orthopaedic outcome associate smoking aforementioned , patient present engage audience , face possibility chronic disability ( poor surgical/fracture outcome ) attribute continuation smoking habit . This impetus abstain benefit fracture outcomes provide window opportunity previously unattained early intervention thus great potential decrease patient morbidity mortality . Furthermore , acute fracture clinic high volume clinic whereby many 100 patient may visit per clinic per day ( patient region within Champlain Local Health Integration Network [ LHIN ] smoke prevalence high 30 % ) . Given unique nature traumatic injury , population consist high proportion male , age 24-34 year old , oblige follow fracture care . This population ( 24-35 year old male ) traditionally regard unattainable primary prevention smoke cessation strategy . Primary prevention strategy paramount public health perspective . In target well establish smoke cessation campaign fracture clinic partnership University Ottawa Heart Institute 's Division Prevention Rehabilitation , patient provide expert cessation strategy onset smoke relate disease . The benefit extend beyond patient family . The ultimate goal project develop intervention model cost effective universally apply orthopaedic clinic within North America . A great potential exists increase smoke cessation rate , decrease orthopaedic trauma smoking related morbidity , long term smoking related morbidity , mortality health care cost .</detailed_description>
