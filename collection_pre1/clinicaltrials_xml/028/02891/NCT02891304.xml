	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : ACE tool colonoscopy EGD allow reliable standardized learning curve , competency benchmark , creation centralize database compare trainee performance amongst peer . Trainees receive quarterly learn curve achieve competence endoscopic procedure faster rate ( ie less procedure ) compare trainee receive usual feedback endoscopic performance establish respective GI fellowship program . Aims : To compare number procedure necessary achieve competence EGD colonoscopy trainee receive learn curve performance feedback every three month addition standard feedback versus trainees receive annual learn curve performance feedback addition standard feedback endoscopic procedure . To demonstrate feasibility development adoption centralize database would allow program director general GI trainee generate performance report relation national peer provide real-time targeted performance feedback training evaluate trainee GI fellowship program director predictor competence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Endoscopy Competence Among Gastroenterology Trainees Era Next Accreditation System .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase emphasis standardize competency assessment demonstrate readiness independent practice medical training transition apprenticeship model competency base medical education ( CBME ) . The Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) replace long-standing reporting system 2014 Next Accreditation System ( NAS ) . For Gastroenterology ( GI ) fellowship program ( GIFPs ) , include assess document competence basic endoscopic procedure [ esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) ] continuous fashion . For colonoscopy , prior minimum threshold 140 procedure competence assess base surrogate competence cecal intubation rate , limited assessment technical cognitive skill require perform high-quality endoscopic examination . Recent data demonstrate wide variability trainee learn curve , hence emphasis need shift away volume procedure perform independent performance well-defined metric . Tools comprehensive assessment motor cognitive ability develop . The American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) endorse assessment competence endoscopy tool ( ACE ) design help GIFPs facilitate implementation NAS requirement . While ACE tool EGD yet validate , Sedlack colleague recently validate ACE tool colonoscopy . Multicenter prospective data need help guide development CBME define learn curve colonoscopy EGD generate centralize database allow program provide individualize feedback follow trainee performance longitudinally throughout training .</detailed_description>
