	<brief_summary>Hypotension often happen immediately anesthetic induction . Particularly 5-10 minute anesthetic induction report happen frequently . Patients may preexist hypovolemia result dehydration impair compensatory response , increase risk . However , still challenge assess intravascular volume status spontaneously breathe patient anesthetic induction . Recently , measurement correct flow time carotid artery introduce quite useful , simple noninvasive evaluation circulate blood volume . The aim study evaluate whether correct carotid artery flow time determine ultrasonography spontaneously breathe patient general anesthesia predict hypotension induction .</brief_summary>
