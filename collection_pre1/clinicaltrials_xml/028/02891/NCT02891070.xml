Patients must willing receive perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis 4 . Female patient childbearing potential must present negative serum pregnancy test , must agree employ adequate birth control measure [ restrict abstinence , barrier contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device license hormonal product ] duration participation study 5 . Patients willing able comply requirement protocol 1 . Patients dural lesion recent surgery still potential CSF leakage 2 . Patients undergone chemotherapy treatment , exclude hormonal therapy , within 3 week prior plan procedure , chemotherapy schedule within 7 day follow surgery 3 . Patients radiation therapy surgical site standard fractionate radiation therapy schedule within 7 day follow surgery 4 . Patients previous craniotomy/craniectomy within 6 month prior study surgery 5 . Use corticosteroid chronic basis ( define daily use corticosteroid ≥8 week ) purpose decrease symptom systemic chemotherapy ( unless steroid discontinue 4 week prior plan surgery ) 6 . Patients know hypersensitivity component IP control ( human fibrinogen , synthetic aprotinin , human albumin , human FXIII , tri sodium citrate , histidine , niacinamide , polysorbate 80 , human thrombin , polyethylene glycol [ PEG ] , trilysine amine ) 7 . Patients know hypersensitivity US Federal Drug &amp; Cosmetic Blue # 1 dye 8 . Evidence infection indicate one following : clinical examination support diagnosis infection , fever ( temperature &gt; 100.7°F 38.2°C ) , positive urine culture , positive blood culture , positive chest X ray consistent pulmonary infection , infection along plan surgical path . A white blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 20000 cells/µL permit patient treated steroid absence infection parameter 9 . Female patient childbearing potential positive pregnancy test intent become pregnant clinical study period 10 . Female patient nurse 11 . Patients exposure another investigational drug device clinical trial within 30 day prior enrolment anticipate 60day Followup period 12 . Patients severely alter renal function confirm local laboratory reference range serum creatinine and/or hepatic function ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 3 × upper limit normal [ ULN ] ) 13 . Patients currently compromise immune system ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome [ AIDS ] ) autoimmune disease , chronic immunosuppressant agent 14 . Patients uncontrolled diabetes evidence institution 's standard care ( glycated haemoglobin [ HbA1c ] &gt; 7 % , blood glucose , etc . ) 15 . Patients traumatic injury head 16 . Patients dural injury craniotomy/craniectomy eliminate widen craniotomy/craniectomy recreate native dural cuff 17 . Patients require surgical approach would allow sutured dural closure transsphenoidal translabyrinthine/petrosal/mastoid . Superficial penetration mastoid air cell allow 18 . Patients hydrocephalus , except occlusive hydrocephalus cause PF pathology incompletely open cerebrospinal fluid pathway , treat surgical procedure 19 .
