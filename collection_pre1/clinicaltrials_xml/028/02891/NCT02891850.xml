	<detailed_description>Data previous single arm study ( RESPITE ) indicate transition PDE5i riociguat may feasible , safe beneficial patient adequately respond PDE5i . REPLACE randomize control study confirm potential clinical benefit transition PDE5i riociguat . Satisfactory clinical response patient stable dose phosphodiesterase-5inhibitors ( PDE-5i ) without endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , treatment goal compare one group patient randomize maintain current treatment another group PDE5i replace riociguat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 75 year . Patients symptomatic PAH pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 400 dyn*sec*cm5 , mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mmHg , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) ≤ 15 mmHg assess recent right heart catheterization ( RHC ) medical history prior screen confirm diagnosis . Alternatively , PCWP replace leave ventricular enddiastolic pressure ( ≤ 15 mmHg ) . PAH follow type : Idiopathic Hereditary Drug toxin induce PAH Associated PAH due : Connective tissue disease ( CTD ) Congenital heart disease , patient underwent surgical repair one year enrolment Portal hypertension liver cirrhosis ( Note : patient clinical relevant hepatic dysfunction exclude ; see exclusion related disorder organ function ) Patients stable dos PDE5i ERA combination therapy stable PDE5i monotherapy 6 week prior randomization treatment goal ( tadalafil 20 40 mg daily sildenafil least 60 mg daily dose ) . WHO FC III screen randomization . 6MWD test 165 440 screening randomization . Stable dose diuretic , use , least 30 day prior randomization . Patients able understand follow instruction able participate study entire study . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception sexually active . Adequate contraception define combination least 2 effective method birth control , least 1 physical barrier ( e.g . condom hormonal contraception like implant combine oral contraceptive , condom intrauterine device ) . This apply begin sign informed consent form 30 ( +5 ) day last administration study drug . Patients must give write informed consent participate study receive adequate previous information prior studyspecific procedure . Participation another interventional clinical study within 30 day prior screen . All type PH ( include PHIIP ) except subtypes Dana Point Group I specify inclusion criterion . Previous treatment riociguat . Pregnant woman ( i.e. , positive serum ßhumanchorionicgonadotropin test sign pregnancy ) , breast feeding woman , woman childbearing potential use combination 2 effective contraception method ( lay inclusion criterion ) throughout study . Patients medical disorder , condition , history would impair patient 's ability participate complete study , opinion investigator . Relevant obstructive restrictive lung disease . Patients underlie medical disorder anticipate life expectancy 2 year ( e.g. , active cancer disease localize and/or metastasize tumor mass ) . Cardiovascular exclusion criterion like leave ventricular disease , coronary heart disease stroke within previous 3 month . Patients hypersensitivity investigational drug excipients . Patients unable perform valid 6MWD test ( e.g. , orthopedic disease , peripheral artery occlusive disease , affect patient 's ability walk ) . Note : Patients , require walk aid , may include opinion investigator walk distance impair . Patients variance 15 % screen randomization ( i.e. , baseline ) 6MWD test .</criteria>
