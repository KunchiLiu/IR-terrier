	<brief_summary>This randomize , 2-arm phase II , multi-center study evaluate overall response rate newly diagnose , transplant ineligible patient receive 9 cycle induction therapy either KTd KRd follow randomization either carfilzomib maintenance treatment 12 month observation . Maintenance give 12 cycle progression disease , whatever occur first .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Comparing KTd vs. KRd Induction Therapy Investigating K-mono Maintenance Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma , clonal neoplastic proliferation plasma cell , second common hematologic malignancy account approximately 72,000 annual death worldwide . There estimate 11,000 death per year US 19,000 death per year Europe . This study examine efficacy carfilzomib ( K ) combination thalidomide , old , well establish first line immunomodulatory imide drug ( IMiD ) newly diagnose multiple myeloma versus K combination lenalidomide 1st line . This trial also evaluate adherence safety thalidomide contain triplet use non-neurotoxic proteasome inhibitor . Moreover , weekly dose carfilzomib address need convenient dose schedule . Finally , yet importantly , trial ass efficacy less cost intensive triplet strategy keep lenalidomide backup later lines.. The second part study - complete 9 cycle induction therapy KTd KRd - patient arm pool randomized 1:1 stratified induction therapy two arm ( K-monotherapy versus observation-only ) .</detailed_description>
