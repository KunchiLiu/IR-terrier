	<brief_summary>Project : EVO video-game base intervention target neural network associate cognitive control . The network implicate poor treatment response middle old age adult suffer major depression . Related work demonstrate healthy old adult show significant improvement cognitive control . In small sample old adult suffer depression ( n=12 ) , find similar improvement selective attention work memory 4 week intervention , along improvement mood comparable participant receive evidence-based psychotherapy . The intent proposal first determine least 2/3 participant use Project : EVO four week demonstrate significant improvement function neural network , improvement observe , conduct second study see change neural network function associate change mood . If show Project : EVO improve neural function mood great degree placebo cognitive training game , position move onto next phase study , demonstrate intervention 's efficacy much large sample adult depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project : EVO ( `` EVO '' ) mobile 3D video game show reduce old adult ' susceptibility interference augment sustain attention work memory ability ( e.g . cognitive control ) target adaptive algorithm . The combination peer-reviewed validity , adaptivity , fun video game mechanic elevate EVO platform beyond at-home training tool reduce burden associate tedious task replication . We propose study EVO potential intervention treatment depression , disorder worsens medical outcome , promotes disability , increase expense , complicate medical care cloud clinical picture undermine treatment adherence . R61 Phase : We first conduct 2-year proof concept study determine EVO engage cognitive control network ( CCN ) 30 middle-aged old adult major depression . Primary aim phase propose project determine EVO result great CCN engagement use three level analysis ( circuitry , performance , self-report ) . At circuitry level , measure CCN engagement probe system use task-based fMRI . We hypothesize activation functional connectivity ( FC ) anterior aspect CCN increase baseline 4-weeks treatment initiation . Our decision move next phase plan study 66 % sample show significant increase CCN function circuitry level analysis ( CCN activation FC ) either performance level self-report level analysis . R33 Phase : Should proof concept phase pas Go/No-go rule , conduct 3-year pilot study compare EVO expectancy-matched control game term CCN target engagement circuitry ( task-based fMRI ) behavioral level ( task performance , self-report ) 60 middle-aged old adult major depression . In addition , well determine change target engagement associate change mood mood-induced disability . The decision move onto development proposal study clinical efficacy EVO large randomize clinical trial base whether find ( 1 ) EVO out-performs control condition term engagement CCN circuitry behavioral level ( 2 ) significant association change engagement CCN change mood ( 3 ) study method feasible complete ( sample rate , retention , intervention adherence , intervention acceptability expectancy-match control condition ) .</detailed_description>
