	<brief_title>Inspiratory Strength Respiratory Complications After SCI Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A spinal cord injury ( SCI ) often lead paralysis respiratory muscle ( 1 ) , cause decrease inspiratory volume consequently limit pre-cough volume need produce effective cough ( 2 ) . The ability cough essential airway clearance ( 3 ) . With reduced cough capacity , risk pneumonia increase ( 1 ) . Pneumonia still among leading cause death SCI population ( 4 , 5 ) . In acute SCI , 80 % patient affected respiratory complication ( 6 ) 51 % case pneumonia occurs ( 7 ) , correspond cumulative pneumonia incidence rate 40 % . Unfortunately , predictor pneumonia SCI still poorly understood ( 6 ) . To investigator knowledge , three study predictor pneumonia SCI population ( 8 , 9 ) . Two study concentrate factor injury shock severity ( 9 ) identify level completeness injury fundamental clinical entity predict pulmonary complication ( 8 ) . However , study investigate potentially modifiable factor . The third study focus potentially modifiable factor , lung function cover respiratory muscle strength define inclusion respiratory complication precisely ( 10 ) . Therefore , facilitate future evidence-based strategy reduce pneumonia risk acute SCI , prevention target study aim identify modifiable risk factor pneumonia urgently need . The current research proposal target specific parameter respiratory function conceivably determinant pneumonia risk well modifiable respiratory muscle training ( 11,12 ) . In recent study ( EKNZ 2014-293 ; accept Publication Respiratory Care ) investigator evaluate various respiratory function parameter identify inspiratory muscle strength reliable discriminator individual without pneumonia . Although investigator identify inspiratory muscle strength best parameter respiratory function discover individual SCI risk pneumonia , data base retrospective singlecenter data analysis without detailed information type , time-point severity pneumonia . Also data mortality due pneumonia personal parameter may influence risk pneumonia well ( e.g . smoking , exercise , mechanical ventilation dependency etc . ) miss analysis . Objective : The main objective study evaluate 'cut-off level ' inspiratory muscle strength predictor pneumonia individual SCI ( diagnostic accuracy ) . Additionally , evaluate lifestyle treatment parameter well personal- lesion characteristic potential determinant pneumonia well impact pneumonia quality life mortality . Determination sample size : Regarding in- exclusion criterion , investigator make calculation realistic number subject recruit study per year center , base number patient admit correspond center last year . Overall , investigator able recruit 250 patient per year study . With anticipated number 625 subject 2.5 year recruitment period , investigator may detect 250 case pneumonia ( assumption 40 % incidence rate ( 6,7 ) . Moreover , take diagnostic accuracy ( i.e. , area curve ( AUC 0.86 retrospective study reference , envision sample size least 250 case per diagnostic group allow detect diagnostically clinically relevant effect ( i.e. , change AUC ) 0.07 0.05 95 % confidence level 80 % power ( 18 ) . Criteria withdrawal : Reasons participant need discontinue project : - withdrawal informed consent - non-compliance - medical complication allow measurement study - death In case drop-out , already record data use analysis . All data drop-out patient anonymized analysis . The investigator report reason withdrawal participant compare reason qualitatively . The study stop case futility , unless CTU Nottwil course safety monitoring advice otherwise . In case , CTU Nottwil discuss potential stop futility study investigator group . The final decision terminate study take Principal Investigator study RESCOM . Risk-Benefit : Patients perform maximum 4 measurement session ( dependent time rehabilitation ) 15 min measurement . Therefore time need study negatively influence rehabilitation include patient . Respiratory muscle strength measurement cough capacity measurement non-invasive also part clinical routine . Safety measurement high best knowledge investigator aware adverse Events due measurement . Potential benefit project result : Increased knowledge determinant effect pneumonia help adapt rehabilitative strategies/therapy prevent patient pneumonia thereby also increase quality life patient life expectancy . Methods minimise bias : Throughout study , cod participant conduct study nurse site order keep data management biostatistician blind study condition long data base open . The coding list remain study nurse site whole duration study . Thus , cod conduct without influence principal investigator raters . The study investigator strive complete separation individual involve step enrolment involve data management analysis . Assessments primary secondary outcome conduct study nurse without influence data analysis . All study nurse go profound assessment training program . A study nurse enter data secuTrial® data management system biostatistician analyze data without access information origin , names participant . Assessment safety reporting : An annual safety report submit year local Ethics Committee via local Investigator . For multi-center study annual safety report contain information site include information site outside Switzerland . The Sponsor-Investigator prepares , submits participate Investigators . The participate Investigators submit local committee . Statistical consideration : To evaluate diagnostic accuracy marker lung function ( particularly MIP ) predict exclude clinical pneumonia investigator use contemporary receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analyse technique allow adjust covariate effect . Univariable multivariable regression model use evaluate primary outcome secondary outcome . Multivariable modelling compare univariable model principally allow investigator investigate relative contribution different predictor ( risk factor ) outcome interest , control potential confounding factor . Multivariable model may use examine effect modification ( interaction ) well mediation . Missing data : Regression analyse primary outcome secondary outcome may suffer miss data , may cause bias loss information analysis restrict study participant complete data ( `` complete-case analysis '' ) . To appropriately account miss data advance regression analysis investigator use multiple imputation technique well iterative imputation method ( missForest ) base random forest . Due relatively high anticipate sample size , analysis split specific sub-Groups ( e.g . completeness lesion , para-/tetraplegia , type pneumonia ) . For mortality flexible parametric model survival data ) secondary outcome analysis perform . Data handling record keeping/ archive The secuTrìal data management system ( iAS , Berlin , Germany ) , web-based data capture management system , use . The system host server Swiss Paraplegic Centre . The project set-up eCRFs test Data Manager Swiss Paraplegic Center , Clinical Trial Unit prior release productive environment use custom test protocol . Every staff member authorize CRF entry initial note CRF investigator subsequently identify . The data CRF later enter secuTrial database ( iAS , Berlin , Germany ) . One person enter data CRF paper form secuTrial database . A second person control correctness data secuTrial principal investigator finally release data archival storage . The Clinical Trial Unit give access 2 people per center : Person A get access data enter control local investigator ( Person B ) data release . Plausibility rule establish data capture system promote data quality . Furthermore , data review verified prior data entry completion . Encrypted data export data management system analysis statistic software . Data protection : Project data handle uttermost discretion accessible authorized personnel . Direct access source document permit purpose monitoring , audits inspection . The data management system allow define role data entry , verification , validation management . An audit trail document entry change make system . Personal data participate subject allow identify individual , store server personal computer , names subject transmit main study center Nottwil . These data print paper store lock data storage room limit access participate center . An anonymous identification number allow connect data enter system , center subject . Only anonymous data store electronic data capture management system . Encrypted data export data management system analysis statistic software . For data verification purpose , authorize representative competent authority ( e.g . ethic committee ) may require direct access part medical record relevant project , include participant ' medical history .</detailed_description>
