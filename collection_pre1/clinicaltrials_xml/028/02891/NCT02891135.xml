	<brief_summary>In 2015 revision global guideline HIV care treatment , World Health Organization call initiate lifelong antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) patient test positive HIV , regardless CD4 cell count . As country adopt new recommendation , know `` treat , '' million additional patient become eligible ART worldwide . In sub-Saharan Africa , patient locate , study continue document high loss treatment-eligible patient care receive first dose antiretroviral medication . Among facility-level reason loss treatment initiation protocol require multiple clinic visit long wait time patient test positive HIV dispense initial supply medication . Simpler , efficient , accelerate algorithms ART initiation need `` treat '' realize benefit expect . Experts propose simplified clinical algorithm screen patient eligibility immediate ART initiation patient 's first clinic visit , without use point-of-care laboratory test technology . The Simplified Algorithm Treatment Eligibility ( SLATE ) use four screen ass whether patient eligible same-day treatment initiation : ) symptom report , ii ) medical history , iii ) brief physical examination ; iv ) readiness assessment . SLATE pragmatic , individually randomize evaluation determine effectiveness algorithm increase ART initiation among non-pregnant adult patient . Approximately 960 HIV-infected adult patient yet ART enrol routine clinic visit randomize receive intervention standard care . Patients intervention arm administer SLATE screen ; find eligible algorithm offer immediate treatment initiation , eligible referred standard clinic care . Patients standard arm refer ART initiation standard clinic procedure . All care initial visit clinic standard care . If successful , SLATE offer standardize approach collect interpret minimum set patient data avoid delay treatment initiation majority patient eligible immediate ART , defer initiation minority start immediately .</brief_summary>
