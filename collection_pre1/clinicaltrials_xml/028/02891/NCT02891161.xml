	<brief_title>Durvalumab And Radiation Therapy Followed Adjuvant Durvalumab Patients With Urothelial Cancer ( T2-4 N0-2 M0 ) Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . The phase Ib study evaluate safety combine durvalumab RT follow adjuvant durvalumab . The phase II study estimate Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) durvalumab plus RT follow single agent durvalumab patient UC bladder . PHASE Ib INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Cohort 1 consist 6 patient receive durvalumab 1500mg 2 dos Q4 weekly RT gross disease , 64.8 Gy , 36 fraction weekdays 7 week . Durvalumab start Day 1 RT . Three patient enrol initially . If 2 patient ( 3 ) experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , combine treatment consider unsafe . Otherwise , additional 3 patient treat dose . If 0 1 patient experience DLT , dose durvalumab deem safe phase 2 part study . If , however , 2 patient ( 6 ) experience DLT , combine treatment consider unsafe . Post-concurrent durvalumab RT , single agent durvalumab given1500mg every 4 week ( ±7 day ) total period 12 month . Adjuvant durvalumab treatment start 3-4 week post completion durvalumab RT . PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Subjects receive durvalumab 1500mg 2 dos Q4 weekly RT gross disease , 64.8 Gy , 36 fraction weekdays 7 week . Durvalumab start Day 1 RT . Post-concurrent durvalumab RT , single agent durvalumab given1500mg every 4 week ( ±7 day ) total period 12 month . Adjuvant durvalumab treatment start 3-4 week post completion durvalumab RT . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month per treat physician . Adequate organ marrow function define : 1 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm3 ) 3 . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ( &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) 4 . Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . This apply subject confirm Gilbert 's syndrome ( persistent recurrent hyperbilirubinemia predominantly unconjugated absence hemolysis hepatic pathology ) , allow consultation physician . 5 . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal unless liver metastasis present , case must ≤ 5x ULN . 6 . Serum creatinine CL &gt; 30 mL/min Cockcroft-Gault formula ( Cockcroft Gault 1976 ) 24-hour urine collection determination creatinine clearance :</detailed_description>

Involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) . Participation another clinical study investigational product within 2 week prior registration . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab . Previous systemic immunotherapy . Previous use intravesical BCG acceptable . History another primary malignancy except : 1 . Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease ≥5 year first dose study drug low potential risk recurrence . However adequately treated prostate cancer &gt; 3 year ago significant change PSA past 6 month include . Patients history prostate cancer must definitive radiation therapy prostate area . 2 . Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease . 3 . Adequately treated carcinoma situ without evidence disease e.g. , cervical cancer situ . Receipt last dose anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody , investigational agent ) within14 day prior first dose study drug ( 14 day prior first dose study drug subject receive prior TKIs [ e.g. , erlotinib , gefitinib crizotinib ] within 6 week nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 ms electrocardiogram ( ECG ) use Frediricia 's Correction . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid .
