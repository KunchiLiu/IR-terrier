	<brief_summary>Recurrent corneal erosion ( RCE ) syndrome observe either context dystrophy basement membrane follow corneal trauma . This syndrome characterized recurrent episode ocular pain less associated localized separation outer epithelium epithelial basal lamina ( basement membrane ) anchorage abnormality two corneal layer . This could result increased expression metalloproteinases cleave hemidesmosomes anchor epithelium basement membrane . The investigator hypothesis episode RCEs favor hyper- expression matricial metalloprotease 9 ( MMP-9 ) induce EMMPRIN Galectin-3 . The identification induction could lead development therapeutic inhibit EMMPRIN Galectin- 3 RCE syndrome .</brief_summary>
