	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Economic incentive use promote change habit smoke weight loss . However study do determine impact strategy management type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Additionally , previous study describe way determine amount economic incentive promote behavioral change , e.g adherence treatment , increase physical activity adherence healthy diet . There also question regard frequency incentive , type incentive ( cash prize ) , preferred payment method study let u answer . Furthermore , want test whether `` team work approach '' ( mixed incentive ) vs. `` individual approach '' ( individual incentive ) also play role introduce behavioral change . Specific Aims : Compare implementation process three different intervention use economic incentive promote behavioral change patient T2DM , end goal identify barrier facilitator tie implementation process intervention . - Learn experience participant T2DM economic incentive . - Learn experience partner participant T2DM . - Evaluate patient 's receptiveness comprehension educational material use promote behavioral change . - Evaluate feasibility reach propose clinical goal term weight loss glycated hemoglobin . - Evaluate patient partner receptiveness towards receive economic incentive tool promote behavioral change . - Explore partner activity effective help T2DM management patient . - Explore whether patient T2DM able keep daily record effort manage diabetes . - Evaluate feasibility packaging implement future clinical trial evaluates impact use economic incentive teamwork people T2DM . Intervention : Intervention 1 : Individual Incentives . A diabetes educator ( DE ) explain study potential participant answer question . The informed consent participant T2DM partner obtain . Baseline information include demographic , socioeconomic status , time disease , treatment co-morbidities , anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , blood pressure ) , chronic complication T2DM , glycated hemoglobin ( A1c ) collect . Follow-up meeting take place every two week three month . After randomization : 1 . Participants receive information study , specify receive prize 80 PEN meeting lose one kilogram period two week . 2 . The DE conduct initial evaluation determine weight provide result A1c . 3 . A plan create determine amount kilogram loss every 2 week . 4 . Participants receive education nutrition , physical activity importance treatment adherence every two week . 5 . Participants receive manual information nutrition physical activity people T2DM , well weight loss plan . 6 . Participants provide logbook register effort manage diabetes loose weight . The information logbook provide start point conversation session DE barrier successes implementation weight loss plan . 7 . In addition introductory meeting , participant seven follow-up meeting final session award 200 PEN participant achieve decrease 1 % A1c 400 PEN achieves decrease 1 % A1c A1c 6.5 % less . Intervention 2 : Mixed Incentives 1 Intervention activity study arm establish individual incentive group . After randomization , participant partner receive information study , specify participant receive prize 80 PEN meeting he/she manage lose one kilogram two-week period . In intervention arm , prize participant . Partners receive information brochure guide support process participant his/her support record . Intervention 3 : Mixed Incentives 2 Intervention activity study arm establish individual incentive group . After randomization , participant partner receive information study , specify receive prize 80 PEN meeting participant manage lose one kilogram two-week period partner present bi-weekly appointment . On day meeting , intervention group , prize split 50/50 participant partner . Moreover , partner receive information brochure guide support process participant his/her support record .</detailed_description>
