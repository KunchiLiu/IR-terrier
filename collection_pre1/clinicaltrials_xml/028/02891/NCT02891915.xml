	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , superiority clinical trial evaluate short course ( 5 day ) vs. standard course ( 10 day ) oral beta-lactam antibiotic therapy ( amoxicillin , amoxicillin-clavulanate , cefdinir ) treatment CAP child 6-71 month age clinically improve prior enrollment . The study randomize approximately 400 enrol subject one two study arm ( approximately 200 child arm ) order reach 360 subject complete Outcome Assessment Visit 1 . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either standard course initially prescribe antibiotic ( 10 day ) short course initially prescribe antibiotic ( 5 day ) plus 5 day match placebo . The study recruit potential subject child diagnose CAP initiated oral beta-lactam therapy healthcare provider EDs , outpatient clinic , urgent care center study site . Day -5 define date oral beta-lactam therapy initiate diagnosis CAP . Potential subject identify time follow clinical diagnosis pneumonia . These subject assess eligibility enrol Day -3 -1 initially prescribe oral beta-lactam therapy . Subjects may also enrol Day 1 ( first day receipt study agent ) provide yet receive dos healthcare provider-prescribed antibiotic therapy day . The Primary objective compare composite overall outcome ( Desirability Outcome Ranking , DOOR ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visit # 1 ( Study Day 8 +/- 2 day ) . The Secondary objective : 1 ) To compare composite overall outcome ( DOOR ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visit # 2 ( Study Day 22 +/- 3 day ) ; 2 ) To compare resolution symptom ( component DOOR ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visits # 1 # 2 ; 3 ) To compare clinical response ( component DOOR ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visits # 1 # 2 ; 4 ) To compare solicited event ( component DOOR ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visits # 1 # 2 ; 5 ) To compare medically attended visit Emergency Departments ( ED ) outpatient clinic , hospitalization , surgical procedure , receipt non-study systemic antibiotic ( component clinical response ) among child 6-71 month age CAP assign strategy short course ( 5 day ) vs standard course ( 10 day ) outpatient beta-lactam therapy Outcome Assessment Visits # 1 # 2</detailed_description>
