	<brief_summary>The study compare effectiveness two health communication dissemination strategy design engage patient family caregiver successfully manage COPD 'real-world ' setting . Both strategy aim advance patient understand COPD , treatment option , self-care task ; support cop disease ; enable adopt variety positive behavior , include adherence treatment plan , smoke cessation , join pulmonary rehabilitation program , assume active , healthy lifestyle . One strategy rely healthcare professional ( HCP ) primary communicator COPD self-management ( HCP arm ) , whereas us dual approach involve healthcare professional peer mentor deliver communication ( HCP plus Peer arm ) . Peer mentor COPD patient caregiver successfully manage COPD receive foundational training peer mentoring . Specifically , study aim : 1 ) Conduct randomize control trial 'HCP ' 'HCP plus Peer ' strategy test 'real-world ' healthcare setting ; 2 ) compare impact strategy patient satisfaction , experience , activation , self- efficacy , self-care behavior , health status , quality life , use Emergency Department ( ED ) hospital service , survival ; , 3 ) compare impact strategy caregiver satisfaction , experience , self-efficacy , stress , cop skill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Peer Support Program Amongst COPD Patients Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study currently recruit study participant intervention development phase ( phase 1 study ) . Recruitment study participant start January 2017 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) prevalent global condition result high mortality , morbidity , symptom burden , functional limitation impact quality life . COPD third lead cause death US lead cause hospitalization . COPD patient report unmet needs regard information disease manage cope intellectual , emotional , social level . Many COPD patient lack information skill need correctly use inhaled medication , manage 'breathlessness episode ' , detect early sign COPD exacerbation . Pulmonary rehabilitation program establish help COPD patient increase exercise capacity reduce fatigue dyspnea daily activity . While clinical trial test program demonstrate significant improvement health-related quality life reduce dyspnea fatigue amongst participant , remain unclear best engage motivate patient participate . Self-management support intervention involve `` collaboratively help patient acquire practice skill need carry disease-specific medical regimen , change health behavior adjust role optimal function , improve day-to-day control disease , improve well-being '' , demonstrate several trial improve health-related quality life , reduce symptom burden , hospitalization , ED visit amongst COPD patient . However , still unclear self-management support strategy employ 'real world ' setting effective engaging , motivating , enable patient successfully follow recommended treatment , adopt desire health behavior , thus achieve desired improvement health outcome . The planned study design single- blind randomize control trial compare effectiveness two strategy engage support COPD patient family caregiver self-management COPD . The two strategies/study arm : 1 ) 'HCP arm ' healthcare professional ( HCP ) primary communicator COPD self-management patient participant ; 2 ) 'HCP plus Peer arm ' , healthcare professional peer mentor engage study participant conversation COPD self-management use multiple channel include 1:1 group conversation . One hundred thirty-nine participant randomize 'HCP arm ' , 186 patient 'HCP plus Peer arm ' . The trial conduct amongst COPD patient come hospital clinic two study site within Johns Hopkins Healthcare System . Recruitment sit multiple setting allow representative COPD patient population enrol study , thus increase external validity study finding . The research study answer research question : Amongst COPD patient caregiver , would dual strategy combine healthcare professional peer mentor delivery COPD self- management education support result great improvement health status quality life , reduction acute healthcare service ' utilization , compare rely healthcare professional alone communication ? Would dual strategy result reduce caregiver stress improve cop satisfaction ? The study hypothesis dual strategy use 'HCP plus peer support ' engage support COPD patient caregiver superior outcomes 'HCP ' strategy follow area : ) Improved health- related quality life reduce number COPD-related hospital ED visit ; b ) improve patient activation , self-efficacy , self-care behavior ; c ) improve family caregiver ' satisfaction self- efficacy . These improvement note 3 , 6 , 9 month compare baseline .</detailed_description>
