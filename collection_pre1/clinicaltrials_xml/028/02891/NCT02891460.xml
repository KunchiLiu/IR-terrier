	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Clinical Response Mitomycin-C Hydrogel ( TC-3 ) Administered Intravesically NMIBC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label , successive dose escalation trial subject Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer ( NMIBC ) , design evaluate clinical response low-intermediate risk tumor within bladder Mitomycin-C embed TC-3 Sterile Hydrogel ( TC-3 ) , administer intravesically , prior TURBT NMIBC subject . Eligible subject NMIBC recruit trial follow initial diagnostic cystoscopy . During diagnostic cystoscopy , number tumor lesion , size location document recorded video photo cystoscopy . A baseline cystoscopy conduct subject evaluation number tumor diameter , map location . Baseline blood sample liver renal function , well complete blood count ( CBC ) coagulation test draw prior instillation ensure eligibility serve reference point systemic safety follow-up . A future TURBT plan 8-10 week post screening . Enrolled subject treat successively 40mg MMC 40 mL TC-3 ( first 6 subject ) 80 mg MMC 40 mL TC-3 ( follow 12 subject ) . At treatment session initiation , 18-20 Fr two-way catheter insert subject 's bladder order completely empty bladder urine . Thereafter , volume 40 mL cool TC-3 mixed 40 mg 80 mg MMC instill catheter bladder subject . The catheter ligate twenty minute , draw bladder subject allow urinate freely . The subject undergo six weekly bladder instillation accord assign treatment either 40 mg MMC ( Group A ) 80 mg MMC ( Group B ) 40 mL TC-3 . Following completion instillation treatment series , 2-4 week heal period prior next follow visit ( overall 10-12 week post screening ) . During 2-4 week follow-up ( FU ) visit , lesion ' status examine cystoscopy . For subject appear complete response ( CR ) , confirm base histological result . For subject classify CR , decision performance TURBT give additional treatment PI 's discretion . Following 2-4 week FU visit , subject manage accord local standard guideline . All patient attempt follow 12 month follow 2-4 week FU within trial . These visit document data regard recurrence progression collect . Moreover , biopsy slide prior ( available ) , follow treatment collect analyzed independent uro-pathologist .</detailed_description>
