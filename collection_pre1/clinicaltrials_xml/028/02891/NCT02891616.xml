	<brief_summary>In current study , advance positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance ( PET/MR ) image method use validate hypothesis melanoma patient receive Dual-Immune Checkpoint Blockade ( DICB ) therapy , ultimately achieve clinical benefit , increase , `` FLARE '' , tumor FLT and/or FDG uptake baseline , see cycle # 1 treatment , 2 cycle treatment responder decline FLT FDG uptake , comparison patient classify `` non-responders '' . In addition , alteration tumor apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW/MRI ) evaluate , expect cycle # 1 : transient reduction ADC due lymphocyte proliferation , increase cellularity restriction water movement respond patient , patient tumor increase ADC 2 cycle therapy associate tumor necrosis . This study evaluate rather early PET image FLT FDG useful image biomarker response DICB .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis unresectable , stage III metastatic melanoma . Patients eligible receive combine dual immunecheckpoint blockade therapy ipilimumab nivolumab , per refer oncologist . Life expectancy ≥ 6 month . Disease measurable . This defined lesion measure least 10mm radiologic imaging . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 1 good Age ≥18 year . Normal organ marrow function define Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ≤5 x upper limit normal patient liver metastasis ) Total bilirubin within 1.5 x institutional level normal direct bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) patient total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL ≥5.6mmol/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mcL Platelets ≥ 75K/mcL Women childbearing potential must negative urinary serum pregnancy test within 7 day baseline imaging . Patient may receive investigational agent Significant autoimmune disease require hospitalization within past two year history lifethreatening autoimmune disease Immunosuppressive therapy include systemic corticosteroid except maintenance dose adrenal insufficiency Known additional malignancy progress require active treatment exception basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Active autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent exception replacement dose steroid adrenal insufficiency , vitiligo , resolve childhood asthma/atopy , intermittent use inhaled steroid , local steroid injection , hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement , Sjogren 's syndrome Active tuberculosis Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , autoimmune disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patients pacemaker , stainless steel aneurysm clip magnetic resonance ( MR ) contraindicate implant foreign body would warrant exclusion study . Pacemakers may reprogrammed turn strong MRI magnetic field . Radiofrequency ( RF ) field MR also cause severe heat pacemaker lead tip . Steel aneurysm clip prone torque strong MR field displace clip may damage vessel , result hemorrhage , and/or death . History pneumonitis require hospitalization systemic immune suppressive therapy . Pregnant woman exclude study</criteria>
