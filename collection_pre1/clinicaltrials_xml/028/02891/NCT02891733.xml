	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer mortality France worldwide . 60 % patient present disease diagnosis immediately metastatic non curable . Adenocarcinomas account 50 % incident tumor . Treatment base platinum-based chemotherapy without maintenance therapy . When exhaust first line , second line treatment offer patient . Three drug allow situation : docetaxel , erlotinib ( inhibitor tyrosine kinase activity receptor epidermal growth factor - TKI-EGFR ) pemetrexed ( fact become virtually standard first online combination platinum patient non-squamous cancer , place second line reduce facto ) . There recommendation treatment third line situation erlotinib allow . Most recently , nivolumab , anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody ( aim enable immunutaire system ) saw demonstrated effectiveness second line beyond two Phase 3 trial compare docetaxel treatment squamous cell carcinoma non-squamous . The recent availability France drug ATU fact likely become standard second line , tend place third line docetaxel . Therefore , erlotinib 4th line situation . However , absence EGFR mutation ( see 10 % Caucasian patient ) use drug seem appropriate even harmful . A selection patient likely benefit prescription EGFR TKI-is essential . Neurotensin ( NTS ) polypeptide 13 amino acid present active central nervous system periphery . At peripheral level , neurotensin secrete postprandial endocrine cell intestinal mucosa involve motor function gastrointestinal tract . The effect neurotensin pas activation three subtypes receptor , mainly , NTSR1 NTSR2 receptor couple G proteins extra-digestive normal tissue , include lung , torque NTS / NTSR1 n express physiologically . Rather , complex likely recur tumor tissue . The mechanism effect derogatory activation torque NTS / NTSR1 matrix metalloproteinases cause release cell membrane ligands `` EGF-like '' thus , activation HER receptor ( EGFR HER1 , HER2 HER3 ) . Indeed , experimental tumor create subcutaneous injection athymic mouse cell line adenocarcinoma NTS + / NTSR1 + ( non-mutated EGFR ) , treatment erlotinib - block EGFR pathway - cause significant decrease tumor growth . Expression neurotensin receptor cancer cell metastatic primary bronchial adenocarcinoma know . Therefore , pejorative prognostic value confirm metastatic setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Analysis Expression Neurotensin Receptor Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective work purely descriptive , : - Evaluate expression tumor cell neurotensin receptor retrospective series patient : - Consecutively treated 2010 2015 St. Joseph hospital ( hundred patient ) Saint-Antoine hospital ( three hundred patient ) , holder metastatic primary lung adenocarcinoma receive even first-line chemotherapy platinum agent ( cisplatin carboplatin ) pemetrexed ( Alimta ° ) - If possible , record patient treated St. Joseph Hospital Saint-Antoine Hospital 2005 2010 part clinical trial evaluate value erlotinib also seek , - Develop score expression NTSR1 take account percentage tumor cell express receptor intensity marking , - Correlate labeling cell NTSR1 clinical course patient see expression NTSR1 factor poor prognosis metastatic patient . Teams involve : Services : - Pharmacy establish list patient treat chemotherapy , - Pathological anatomy-to group blades ensure immunohistochemical stain reading , - Pneumology Thoracic Oncology resume clinical history patient . The scientific coordination study conduct INSERM UMR-S 1007 , cellular homeostasis cancer - Reprogramming biological alternative therapy response ( University Center Holy Fathers , 45 rue de Saints Pères , 75006 Paris ) , one team direction Dr. Patricia Forge , work couple NTS / NTSR1 . expect benefit Beyond two three conventional chemotherapy line , doubt add - proportion patient still determine - new immunotherapy drug , long recommendation treatment patient lung cancer metastatic non-small cell . Erlotinib option since limitation approval prescription ond line . However , absence EGFR mutation , therapeutic value drug appear low . Preclinical data investigator obtain laboratory hypothesize tumor express NTSR1 could meet TKI EGFR absence mutation receptor . The plan study ass percentage patient situation order prepare organization Phase II study evaluate clinical relevance TKI EGFR select population patient carry non-mutated tumor . Nature data collect A file drawn clinical data find file : patient carrier metastatic primary lung adenocarcinoma receive chemotherapy . The data obtain : age , sex , smoke status , number course chemotherapy receive response treatment , usual chronological parameter establishment survival curve . Histological sample process locally two hospital , accord specific procedure determine laboratory INSERM Unit . Identification subject circulation process data In study , inclusion carry within hospital group Paris Saint-Joseph Saint-Antoine hospital . Histological sample process locally two hospital , accord specific procedure determine pathological anatomy INSERM Unit Laboratories . These histological sample store Pathological Anatomy Laboratory Groupe Hospitalier Paris Sani Joseph . Each study participant identify code inclusion ( first name surname - year birth ) . The concordance table link assign code participant 's name keep participate center , file protect password specific principal investigator center . Data collect different center anonymous paper medium ( code inclusion patient include ) centralize within GHPSJ enter database anonymous access protect PIN study GHPSJ .
