	<brief_title>Randomized Investigation Thyroid Operation Day Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many surgical procedure , previously result day week 's hospital admission , do outpatient procedure . This result well surgical anaesthesiology technique well economic incentive . Examples another surgical field cholecystectomy back oto-rhino- laryngology ( ORL ) also tonsillectomy . Hemithyriodectomy outpatient procedure become increasingly popular already applied country . However many European country continue procedure hospital admission post-operatively ( inpatient surgery ) , due risk complication . In Denmark hemithyroidectomy currently do least one night hospital admission observation mention . At ORL department KÃ¸ge hospital annually perform approximately 200 hemithyroidectomies . It common procedure number procedure yearly increase . Complications hemithyroidectomy include postoperative haemorrhage , damage recurrent laryngeal nerve , hypothyroidism infection veryn rarely hypocalcaemia . With sufficient patient information , above-mentioned complication manage outpatient setting . Postoperative haemorrhage serious complication thyroid surgery unique outpatient setting , consider risk cervical haemorrhage secondary lead respiratory failure due tracheal compression laryngeal oedema rapid sequence . Incidence haemorrhage thyroid surgery vary 0.19 % 2.8 % bleeding occur within six hour postoperatively . There two different approach event post- operative haemorrhage ; acute decompression bedside acute re-operation . Acute decompression reserve respiratory failure . Eligibility criterion may undergo outpatient thyroid surgery debate literature . No consensus reach criterion . For , consensus patient ( high risk bleeding ) require inpatient procedure , carefully select group patient outpatient thyroid surgery already perform , inclusion criterion . Outpatient hemithyroidectomy show low number complication retrospective study well high patient acceptance economical advantage recent prospective retrospective study study . However , recent national international study recommend outpatient procedure , mainly due risk late cervical haemorrhage . It therefore important continue investigate whether hemithyroidectomyis feasible outpatient procedure , especially consider patient safety acceptance . This do randomized control trial half patient allocated outpatient procedure half inpatient procedure . The aim non-inferiority compare two above-mentioned procedure . As far author know , previous RCT do publish purpose .</detailed_description>
