	<detailed_description>Purpose : Glaucoma lead cause irreversible blindness worldwide third lead cause vision loss United States . It estimate great 4.3 million Americans glaucoma 2030 . The treatment option topical medication , laser surgery , incisional surgery . The goal therapy low intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Despite adequate lowering IOP , many patient continue lose vision due progressive glaucomatous optic atrophy . This likely related poor understand glaucoma pathogenesis . There two theory explain mechanism primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . The mechanical theory posit intraocular pressure ( IOP ) produce optic nerve damage biomechanical structural factor . All current therapeutic intervention aim particular mechanism . The vascular theory suggest compromise optic nerve microvasculature induce glaucomatous optic nerve damage . There significant body literature support role ocular hemodynamic ( OHD ) change development progression glaucoma . However , limited investigation effect surgical intervention OHD . This primarily due lack non-invasive , cost-effective method assess OHD factor . Today , technology exists assess factor manner . Thus , purpose study assess response OHD factor surgical intervention glaucoma patient . Participants : Seventy-five participant vary degree open angle glaucoma ( OAG ) meet clinical criterion cataract glaucoma surgery recruit glaucoma clinic University North Carolina ( UNC ) Kittner Eye Center . Once determine eligible , assign one three group base upon surgical indication . Group 1 cataract surgery . Group 2 cataract surgery iStent ( Glaukos Corp. , Laguna Hills , CA ) implantation . Group 3 implantation glaucoma drainage device . Each procedure complete standardized fashion standardization post-operative medication . An effort make gender age match surgical group well provide reasonable racial ethnic diversity . Procedures ( method ) : Participants undergo assessment 24 hour IOP ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) , retinal oxygen saturation ( RSO2 ) , optic nerve blood flow ( ONBF ) , within 10 day assign surgical procedure 6-8 week post-operatively . Ambulatory IOP OPP : IOP measure use TriggerfishÂ® ( Sensimed AG , Lausanne , Switzerland ) contact lens sensor ( CLS ) every five minute . Blood pressure ( BP ) measure ambulatory BP measure ( ABPM ) every 30 minute day every hour overnight . Participants CLS ABPM place study personnel , wear 24 hour assume typical daily activity sleep regimen , return clinic follow day device remove . Optic Nerve Blood Flow Retinal Oximetry : Prior placement CLS ABPM participant undergo assessment ONBF use Doppler spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) RSO2 use Oxymap T1 ( Oxymap , Reykjavik , Iceland ) retinal oximeter .</detailed_description>
