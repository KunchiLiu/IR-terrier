	<brief_summary>The OPTIONs study randomize control , non-inferiority study evaluate postoperative care use outpatient clinic visit versus telephone call woman undergo surgery pelvic floor disorder . The primary outcome patient satisfaction use Surgical-Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems ( S-CAHPS ) questionnaire provide Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) . Secondary outcome include safety cost analysis patient ' direct indirect medical cost . Women speak understand either English Spanish planning undergo elective surgery pelvic disorder recruit . Baseline demographic , satisfaction , cost analysis questionnaire acquire pre-operatively . Randomization assign time discharge hospital . Patients either schedule clinic visit 1-2 week , 6 week , 3 month telephone call registered nurse interval . Questionnaires complete 3 month satisfaction cost analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Objectives Healthcare United States costly , result high patient satisfaction need reform . It well know current state healthcare delivery trap paradox higher spending poorer outcome compare country . To bring American healthcare back course , focus must shift value . Health care value rely quality cost follow equation : value = quality ÷ cost . Quality incorporate clinical outcome , safety , patient satisfaction . Routinely , hospital provider rat postoperative care use Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems ( S-CAHPS ) endorse Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) . ( http : //cahps.ahrq.gov ) In equation , value increase improve quality increase patient satisfaction and/or lower cost without negatively impact outcome maintain safety . All healthcare stakeholder include patient , payer , provider , supplier benefit work towards improve value . The value routine , interval post-operative visit unknown . Post-operative clinical visit consider `` gold standard '' base solely tradition . Postoperative care patient telephone utilized place traditional outpatient postoperative visit pediatric adult surgery literature . Retrospectively , form postoperative care proven safe , effective , reduce patient ' nonmedical cost improvement patient satisfaction measure non-validated global scale . However , prospective trial evaluate patient satisfaction safety phone call postoperative visit undertake . A key gap assess value Urogynecologic care assess value routine postoperative visit . The specific aim study include follow : 1 . Compare patient satisfaction postoperative care among woman randomize telephone call versus routine outpatient visit 3 month measure postoperative domain S-CAHPS . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize patient receive postoperative care telephone call report non-inferior satisfaction S-CAHPS woman in-person postoperative clinic visit . 2 . Compare adverse event 3 month patient randomize telephone call versus postoperative visit . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize adverse event differ two group . 3 . Determine cost-effectiveness postoperative care telephone call versus visit 3 month use patient societal perspective . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize postoperative care phone call cost-effective in-person visit patient societal perspective . Ultimately , long-term goal institute novel approach postoperative care add value healthcare delivery . The overall objective replace routine postoperative visit telephone follow-up non-inferiority randomize control trial postoperative patient surgery pelvic floor disorder . The central hypothesis novel use telephone follow-up call versus clinic visit uncomplicated post-operative patient surgery pelvic floor disorder result non- inferior satisfaction care well significantly reduce patient ' direct indirect nonmedical cost postoperative care . The hypothesis formulate basis retrospective , observational study pediatric adult surgery literature . The rationale propose research , establish postoperative care telephone call offer similar rate satisfaction among patient postoperative care , new approach healthcare offer alternative routine postoperative care . B . Study Design The investigator conduct randomize non-inferiority trial compare patient satisfaction outpatient visit telephone call post-operative care . The investigator recruit woman pre-operatively UNM Urogynecology clinic undergoing surgery pelvic floor disorder include urinary and/or anal incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse and/or pelvic pain , and/or mesh exposure/complications . All woman give write informed consent . Patients randomized time discharge either telephone follow-up outpatient visit . Computer generate randomization assign research staff uninvolved recruitment store opaque , sequentially numbered envelops . Follow-up randomization arm schedule 1-2 week , 6 week , 3 month post-operatively , common timeframes routine postoperative visit practice . C. Number Subjects The recruitment goal study 120 patient allocate 60 patient clinic visit group 60 patient telephone follow-up group . The sample size study determine primary objective , patient satisfaction measure Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems ( S-CAHPS ) survey . The investigator conduct non-inferiority patient satisfaction study compare postoperative care clinic visit versus telephone call . The investigator able identify two publication use S-CAHPS ; report score individual item , well composites `` top box '' response individual item . For example , responses question , `` After surgery surgeon listen carefully ? '' three response : 1 . Yes , definitely , 2 . Yes , somewhat , 3 . No . A top box response `` Yes , definitely '' . The global satisfaction surgeon single item , range 0 ( bad surgeon possible ) 100 ( best surgeon possible ) , `` top '' box responses 100 . `` Top '' box responses prior study range 56-100 % majority responses 90 % . Assuming control experimental group equivalent patient satisfaction , non-inferiority calculation apply use 90 % percentage `` success '' control group experimental group 80 % power , alpha 0.05 , 15 % non-inferiority limit . In equation , truly difference control experimental group , 100 patient total sample size require 80 % sure upper limit 90 % two-sided confidence interval exclude difference favor control group 15 % . The primary outcome measure global composite surgeon rating , use previous study . This sample size provide similar power comparison item scale S-CAHPS group . The investigator anticipate 10 % woman recruit complication preclude participation consent prior randomization , poorly control pain , complication surgeon concern . In addition , investigator anticipate 10 % woman lose follow-up . Therefore plan recruit total 120 woman , 60 per group .</detailed_description>
