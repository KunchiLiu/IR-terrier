Secondary organization-related aim nurse proficiency satisfaction cancer pain self-management support , participation rate , implementation fidelity . Inclusion exclusion criterion : On 17 ward 3 hospital Vienna adult oncology patient include ( n=150 pre- , n=150 post-implementation ) admit one participating ward , pain ≥3 ( 0=no pain 10=worst imaginable pain ) regular pain medication , able understand German , discharge pain self-management , give informed consent . Patients sign disorientation may severely limit pain self-management exclude . Interventions : Pre-implementation , patient receive standard care . Post-implementation , patient receive ANtiPain base 3 key strategy : information , skills build nurse coaching consist in-hospital session staff nurse follow-up phone call discharge . The implementation process include train designated staff nurse , case discussion , well measure ensure sustainability implementation ( e.g. , train clinical nurse specialist ) .

	<brief_title>Praxis Evaluation Pain Self-management Support Intervention Oncology Patients : A Stepped Wedge Design Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Despite highly effective treatment option , adequate pain control persistent problem oncology patient . As cancer treatment shift increasingly towards outpatient setting , patient ' self-management vital successful pain treatment . ANtiPain ( Advanced Nursing Practice cancer pain self-management support ) cancer pain self-management support intervention patient cancer already available tested German speak setting . So far , cancer pain self-management support intervention test rigorously control set randomize control trial ( RCT ) thus evidence comparative effectiveness lacking . Objective This study unique aim evaluate implementation ANtiPain intervention routine clinical practice view effectiveness patient nurse realistic clinical setting . Methods Design , set sample In context routine quality improvement , AntiPain implement designate ward three hospital Vienna . To evaluate implementation , accompany multicenter cluster randomize trial step wedge design supplement embedded qualitative evaluation . The stepped wedge design involve sequential rollout intervention . The order ANtiPain implement ward determine random . By end study , ward implement intervention . Patients recruit 17 ward . With effect size d=.77 expect drop-out rate 20 % , sample size 150 patient need implementation demonstrate difference 5 % level 90 % power . With 17 ward study duration 15 month , approximately 1.3 patient recruit per month participating ward . Objective specific aim In congruence Reach Efficacy Adoption Implementation Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) framework , implementation ANtiPain evaluate two level : ( ) patient-related outcome ( e.g. , pain interference daily activity , pain intensity , patient related barrier cancer pain management ) , ( ii ) organization-related outcome ( e.g. , nurse ' self-rated perceived proficiency pain management , application fidelity ) . The primary aim implementation project improve patient-related outcome . The primary patient-related outcome pain interference daily activity . Secondary patient-related outcome pain intensity , patient-related barrier cancer pain management , pain-related self-efficacy , quality life . The secondary aim explore participation rate [ Reach ] , improve nurse-related outcome [ e.g . proficiency satisfaction concern pain self-management support ( Adoption Implementation ) ] , achieve high implementation fidelity clinical set [ Implementation ] , evaluate nursing manager ' view implementation [ Adoption ] , crude cost resource estimation implementation [ Adoption ] , explore implementation fidelity develop time [ Maintenance ] , explore nursing manager view maintain intervention organization [ Maintenance ] ) . Implementation cancer pain self-management support Before implementation , patient receive standard care without structured cancer pain self-management support . After implementation , patient receive cancer pain self-management support train staff nurse follow ANtiPain protocol . ANtiPain base three key strategy : Provision information , skills build nurse coaching . It consist in-hospital baseline one-to-one session discharge telephone follow accord structure clinical algorithm base pain intensity , patient satisfaction pain management patient adherence . The implementation process include train designated staff nurse , coach activity base case discussion ward , well measure ensure sustainability implementation ( e.g. , train ward manager clinical nurse specialist ) . Variables Measurement Data collection patient level include pain interference daily activity , pain intensity , analgesic intake Brief Pain Inventory . In addition , self-developed item previous study use measure pain-related activity hindrance , ask patient rate `` The pain hinder thing I want today '' 0 ( ) 10 ( completely ) numeric rating scale . Patient-related barrier cancer pain management measured German short version Barriers Questionnaire II ( BQII-G-S ) ; pain-related self-efficacy German version Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire ( FESS ) ; HRQoL two item EORTC-Quality Life Questionnaire C30 , functional status German version Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG-PS ) ; Depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-2 ) ; demographic clinical data include age , gender , time since first cancer diagnosis , time since first pain onset , circadian rhythm pain , analgesic medication , reason day hospitalization well day discharge . Full patient self-report data collection include ~80 item . Because patient burden substantial issue last study , patient say complete questionnaire offer complete short version study questionnaire ( 49 item ) . Data collection nurse level include 4 question regard self-rated proficiency cancer pain self-management support satisfaction pain management ward . In addition , demographic data obtain ( e.g. , age , time ward ) . Data collection ward hospital level include medical field , length stay , number patient ( cancer-related pain ) . Standard care explore ask nurse role cancer pain self-management support implementation . Qualitative substudy : The qualitative substudy comprise interview head nurse intervention nurse view implementation . Procedures Wards randomize accord step wedge plan . Data collection start January 2016 . Eligible patient recruited staff nurse support study assistant . After informed consent patient ask complete questionnaire admission ( TP0 ) , well 2 ( TP1 ) , 4 ( TP2 ) 8 week ( TP3 ) discharge . Nurse-level data collect one week implementation ( TN0 ) 1 ( TN1 ) 3 month implementation ( TN2 ) . Data ward hospital level collect study assistant begin study . The statistical analysis primary outcome ( i.e. , pain interference daily activity ) conduct base mixed model , random intercept respective ward time covariate take potential time trend account . Ethical consideration The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki . Within cluster ( ward ) , patient provide tailored oral write informed consent ( i.e. , pre- post-implementation ) . During informed consent procedure patient informed quality improvement project general . As soon intervention implement routine clinical practice respective ward , patient offer intervention . Consequently , informed consent procedure involve consent intervention completion questionnaire .</detailed_description>
