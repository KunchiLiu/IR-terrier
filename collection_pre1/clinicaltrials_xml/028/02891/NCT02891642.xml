	<brief_title>Liquid Biopsy With Immunomagnetic Beads Capture Technique Malignant Cell Detection Body Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A serous effusion common event metastatic carcinoma , also associate benign medical condition . Current standard method detect malignancy cytological examination . However , cytological examination often low sensitive , often due large amount fluid relatively sparse tumor cell present presence many normal cell mesothelial cell . The investigator develop new method , malignant cell enrichment immunomagnetic bead capture follow Pap stain NGS , identify target malignant cell body fluid . McAb NJ001 develop malignant cell isolation immunomagnetic bead capture technique . This prospective , multi-center , double-blind , statistically power clinical trial enroll patient schedule undergo procedure removal fluid serous effusion without clinical diagnosis caner . The purpose current study compare novel serous effusion detection assay use NJ001 coat immunomagnetic bead capture follow Pap stain NGS analysis traditional cytologic evaluation .</detailed_description>
