	<brief_title>Goal Directed Versus Conventional Weight Loss Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study determine goal direct program improves weight loss outcome sleeve gastrectomy . Bariatric patient manage multidisciplinary team comprise bariatric surgeon , dietician , physiotherapist , physician . In conventional weight loss program , patient give ideal weight strive toward surgery . Previous patient undergo bariatric surgery standard program often enquire expect excessive weight loss target bariatric surgery . This patient driven need lead development goal direct weight loss program . This modified program involve component behavioural intervention . Bariatric patient modify program counsel prior LSG EWL target set patient achieve fix interval post LSG . These target chart graph , patient 's actual weight chart graph clinic consultation , provide strong visual aid counseling motivation . The aim study recruit 120 patient undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . These patient randomize either goal direct program standard program . Patient demographic , preoperative weight , post operative weight 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month post laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy collect . Univariate multivariate analysis perform group excess weight loss primary endpoint . Such trial would allow evaluation know effort spend implement goal direct weight loss program translate improved weight loss outcome bariatric surgery patient . There significant risk involve implementing program patient . This base retrospective review patient undergone goal direct program NUH . If program show improve weight loss outcomes post surgery , could potentially adopt bariatric center worldwide . If goal direct program show bear weight loss outcome , extra effort bariatric team implement program could well direct endeavour .</detailed_description>
