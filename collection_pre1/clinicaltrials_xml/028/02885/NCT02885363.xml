	<brief_summary>The main objective study clarify prospectively prognosis patient newly diagnose carrier LVNC ( incident case ) ( i.e . without occurrence survival follow event : death , heart transplantation hospitalization cardiovascular complication ) . In second time , prognosis factor identify patient LVNC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Isolated Left Ventricular Non Compaction ( LVNC ) rare cause cardiomyopathy suppose result cessation normal embryogenesis infarction , characterize persistent ventricular trabeculations prominent . This frequently familial disease , genetic characterization still incomplete , require identification new gene desirable . The prognosis LVNC uncertain , mortality rate report literature range 2 38 % . Some series conclude LVNC severe heart disease , responsible high mortality , LVNC frequently associate favorable prognosis . These series however limited short duration follow-up small number patient include . Between 2004 2006 , French registry LVNC , include 105 case . It find LVNC associate high rate complication outbreaks severe heart failure , need heart transplantation , severe rhythm disorder , embolic event . The prognosis LVNC France appear pejorative : 1 . - evidence prognosis different form cardiomyopathy . 2 . - result register skewed inclusion incident prevalent case ( statistical survival bias ) . Thus , longer-term monitoring identification relevant prognostic marker imperative good understand rare disease improve therapeutic management .</detailed_description>
