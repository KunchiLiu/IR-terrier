	<brief_title>Splinting After Mini-Open Carpal Tunnel Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek determine significant difference patient-reported clinical outcome exist among 3 different postoperative splint regimens- splint , removable splint , plaster non-removable splint- follow mini-open carpal tunnel release ( CTR ) surgery symptomatic , isolated , nerve conduction study positive carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . A total 249 patient receive mini-open CTR subsequently randomize 1 3 splinting regimen remove first postoperative visit 10-14 day later . Patient-reported outcome include QuickDASH survey , Levine-Katz Symptom Severity Scale ( SSS ) Functional Status Scale ( FSS ) Pain Rest Action use Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) . Clinical outcome include wrist range motion ( ROM ) , grip lateral pinch strength . All outcomes evaluate bilaterally 10-14 day , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month surgery . Demographic information obtain preoperatively complication observe record throughout study</detailed_description>
