	<brief_summary>Even advance clinical therapy percutaneous intervention , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) still widely use treatment patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . However , complex procedure trigger important organic implication especially pulmonary function . In relation treatment patient undergo CABG , recovery link cardiac rehabilitation program . These program also associate muscle training measure , among inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) . Most study implement moderate-intensity IMT daily , study effect high intensity training load perform alternate day . In context , justify use device recent Powerbreathe , use high training load would provide great benefit , whereas magnitude response training tend increase load . OBJECTIVE : To investigate efficiency high intensity IMT associate combined aerobic resistance training maximal exercise capacity , submaximal exercise capacity , respiratory muscle strenght , pulmonary function , oxidative stress , quality life endothelial function patient underwent CABG phase II cardiac rehabilitation program . METHODOLOGY : This clinical trial , control , randomize , double-blind develop partnership Cardiology Clinic Hospital Universit√°rio de Santa Maria ( HUSM ) , Santa Maria , RS , Brazil . Patients undergo evaluation pulmonary function respiratory muscle strength ( spirometry digital manovacuometry ) , well maximal exercise capacity ( Ergospirometry ) , submaximal functional capacity ( 6MWT 6MST ) , quality live ( MLHFQ ) Oxidative stress endothelial function ( blood biomarkers ) . After evaluation randomly allocate two group : control group perform cardiac rehabilitation associate Sham IMT , experimental group cardiac rehabilitation associate IMT High-intensity . The intervention last twelve week group phase patient submit assessment tool . EXPECTED RESULTS : The high intensity IMT potentiate effect cardiac rehabilitation ( phase II ) coronary artery bypass surgery patient .</brief_summary>
