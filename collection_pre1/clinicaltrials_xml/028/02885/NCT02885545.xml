	<brief_title>The Strategy Prevent Hemorrhage Associated With Anticoagulation Renal Disease Management ( STOP HARM ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 25 million North American 's chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) include 600,000 require dialysis end-stage renal disease.The importance CKD underscore poor survival , frequent hospitalization impair health relate quality life patient CKD . Stroke important cause morbidity , mortality suffer patient CKD . Stroke approximately 5 10 time common patient advanced CKD compare non-CKD patient . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , important risk factor stroke , occur 20.4 % patient advanced CKD . Observational study suggest anywhere approximate 56 % relative risk reduction 2-fold increase risk stroke warfarin . Furthermore , risk bleeding patient advance CKD roughly 5-fold high patient without CKD . Although OAC may prevent stroke patient advance CKD , still increase risk major bleed 1.4 fold . New stroke prevention strategy patient CKD AF urgently need . An effective strategy must reduce risk thromboembolic event increase risk bleed substantially . Left atrial appendage occlusion ( LAAO ) device Watchman , represent unique opportunity accomplish effective stroke prevention mitigate risk bleed patient population .</detailed_description>
