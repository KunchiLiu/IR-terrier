	<brief_summary>The enormous rapidly grow burden Heart Failure Preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFpEF ) lead need understand pathogenesis treatment option morbid disease . Recent research investigator 's group others show pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) highly prevalent HFpEF , right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction present early advanced stage HFpEF . These abnormality RV pulmonary vasculature couple limitation pulmonary vasodilation exercise . There therapies directly target pulmonary vasculature clearly show effective HFpEF . A recent study Mayo Clinic Investigators demonstrate pulmonary vasodilation dobutamine ( beta 2 agonist ) HFpEF . As intravenous therapy , feasible outpatient use . In proposed randomize , placebo-controlled double blind trial , investigator seek evaluate whether commonly use inhaled bronchodilator albuterol ( beta 2 agonist ) , administer high-efficiency nebulizer device achieve true alveolar drug delivery , improve pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) rest exercise patient HFpEF compare placebo . This potential lead simple cost effective intervention improve symptom HFpEF , potentially test World Health Organization ( WHO ) Pulmonary Hypertension group . PVR excellent surrogate marker pulmonary vasodilation use previous early trial PH therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preliminary study support feasibility : Recent research investigator 's group show right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction present third patient HFpEF presence pulmonary vascular disease pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) high ( related pulmonary venous hypertension well pulmonary vascular disease ) . Both associated adverse outcome exercise intolerance therapy currently available directly target pulmonary vasculature HFpEF . The investigator recently demonstrate significant improvement pulmonary vascular function dobutamine ( β2 agonist ) administer acutely HFpEF . As intravenous therapy , suitable chronic outpatient use . Hospitalized patient heart failure often demonstrate symptomatic improvement inhale β2 agonist therapy , even absence pulmonary disease , animal study also show improved resolution pulmonary edema albuterol . In proposed randomized , double blind placebo-controlled trial , investigator seek evaluate whether commonly use inhaled bronchodilator albuterol , administer high-efficiency nebulizer device , improve pulmonary vascular function patient HFpEF-PH compare placebo . This potential lead simple cost effective intervention improve symptom HFpEF-PH , potentially test WHO PH group . In absence frank sign congestive heart failure , patient early HFpEF reliably diagnose exercise right heart catheterization , routinely perform Mayo Clinic part evaluation patient unexplained dyspnea . The presence elevate pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) rest ( &gt; 15 mmHg ) exercise ( &gt; 25 mmHg ) ; elevate mean pulmonary artery pressure rest ( &gt; 25 mm Hg ) exercise ( &gt; 40 mmHg ) use invasively diagnose HFpEF exercise pulmonary hypertension high degree validity reliability . Just exercise stress unmasks abnormality leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function early stage HFpEF , investigator recently show exercise stress reveals early abnormality pulmonary artery vascular function compare control without HF apparent rest data alone . Using objective diagnosis HFpEF exercise induce PH , investigator seek evaluate hemodynamic change exercise pulmonary vascular resistance , peak cardiac output subjective dyspnea inhale albuterol therapy pulmonary vasodilation . Study design : This study perform randomize , double blind placebo-controlled fashion use inhaled albuterol inhale saline ( prepared research pharmacy ) administer novel high-efficiency nebulizer 1:1 fashion . Patients undergo right heart catheterization ( RHC ) expired-gas analysis use high Fidelity micromanometer catheter rest exercise , baseline follow treatment study drug , use novel study design investigator previously utilize report . Rest exercise measurement repeat receive inhale albuterol control therapy . Patients refer cardiac catheterization laboratory invasive exercise stress test prospectively recruit . Standard RHC use high fidelity micromanometers ( Millar Instruments ) perform rest supine exercise simultaneous expire gas analysis ( MedGraphics ) current practice . The protocol rest-20 Watts exercise x 5 minute , grade workload increase 10-20 Watt increment ( 3 minute stage ) exhaustion . Hemodynamic , arterial mixed venous blood gas expire gas data acquire rest , exercise stage peak exercise . Venous blood sample obtain rest peak exercise . Perceived symptom dyspnea fatigue quantify use Borg dyspnea effort score stage exercise . Limited echocardiography perform cardiologist skilled image focused measure RV morphology function . After initial exercise study hemodynamics return baseline , study drug ( normal saline placebo albuterol 2.5 mg ) inhale high efficiency nebulizer 5 minute . After 10 minute observation period , rest hemodynamic expire gas data acquire exactly initial run . Subjects repeat 20 Watt x 5 minute exercise phase . Subjects repeat exercise 20 Watt stage , rather repeat entire study . This do increase feasibility shorten time case . The investigator previously observe vast majority ( &gt; 85 % ) elevation cardiac filling pressure reduction venous oxygen content people HFpEF occur low 20 Watt workload , repeat exercise hemodynamic assessment load sufficient detect clinically meaningful treatment effect albuterol .</detailed_description>
