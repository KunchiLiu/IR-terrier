	<detailed_description>This clinical trial use combination ionize radiation immunotherapy durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) . It investigators hypothesis combination ionize radiation immunotherapy well tolerate stimulates clinically significant pancreas-cancer specific immune response . This trial 's primary objective evaluate whether combination RT durvalumab improve median PFS compare chemotherapy historical control data metastatic pancreas cancer patient progress first-line chemotherapy . The study population include metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient progress first-line chemotherapy . The number subject propose complete study 55 .</detailed_description>

No lesion would receive RT &gt; 7 cm great dimension . 8 . Subjects must consent study procedure describe protocol include radiographic evaluation repeat blood draw . 9 . Adequate normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm3 ) Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ( &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . This apply subject confirm Gilbert 's syndrome ( persistent recurrent hyperbilirubinemia predominantly unconjugated absence hemolysis hepatic pathology ) , allow consultation physician .
