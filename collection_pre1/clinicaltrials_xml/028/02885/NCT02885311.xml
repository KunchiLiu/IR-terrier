	<detailed_description>Excessive drinking ( ED ) alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) remain one nation 's lead public health problem , yet problem largely under-recognized undertreated . Although many people ED/AUD see primary care physician annually , limit research implementation model treat ED/AUD primary care . Important change healthcare system advance alcohol research offer new potentially transformative opportunity integrate ED/AUD treatment primary care practice . In particular , change lead development new patient-centered , integrate care model facilitate treatment behavioral health issue primary care . Experts repeatedly call development chronic care model treat alcohol problem primary care , similar model use treat chronic illness , include depression . Yet , research develop test model surprisingly limit . The primary aim study develop test chronic care model treat ED/AUD patient-centered model home ( PCMH ) use NIH stage model intervention development . Specifically , use mixed method approach , study proposes adapt test collaborative care ( CC ) model depression treat ED/AUD high volume PCMH . Importantly , build CC model onto Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) program already place PCMH . Notably , SBIRT model currently refers ED/AUD specialty treatment provider . The propose study conduct two phase . Phase I involve initial adaptation CC model depression . During phase , relevant depression CC protocols measure adapt ED/AUD pilot tested participant ( n = 25 ) recruit PCMH . Phase II involve model refinement base iterative cycle patient PCMH staff feedback examination drink outcome data . During phase , participant ( n = 60 ) assess follow three month . Iterative development focus : 1 ) utilize stepped-care model treatment include outpatient detoxification , behavioral intervention , medication intervention management , 2 ) maximize patient engagement , 3 ) balance resource expertise constraint treat ED/AUD PCMH . Participants Phases 1 2 follow 1 3 month primary outcome data drinking outcome examine .</detailed_description>
