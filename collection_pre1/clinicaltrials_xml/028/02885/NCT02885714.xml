	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tear common disable condition relate acute trauma fall shoulder . A tear associate symptom pain abduction , abduction weakness night pain . Rotator cuff tear surgery well-established form treatment acute rotator cuff tear , although beneficial result report conservative surgical treatment rotator cuff tear . Rotator cuff tear repair surgery involve considerable amount re-ruptures , possible repair tendon heal despite surgical repair . On hand rotator cuff tear also find completely asymptomatic person clinical significance rupture may generally lower estimate . The above-mentioned factor , well recent research meta-analysis treatment mainly degenerative rotator cuff tear indicate limited evidence surgery effective treating symptomatic rotator cuff tear conservative treatment alone . However , previous research finding apply directly traumatic tear , although degeneration consider always contribute creation rotator cuff tear . During last decade , despite lack evidence superiority one treatment another , use surgery treat disorder substantially increase . Treatment expectation find important predict patient related outcome measure . In addition , surgery may produce profound placebo effect . There previous placebo-controlled trial topic interest . In order find true efficacy surgical treatment acute , trauma related rotator cuff tear involve mainly supraspinatus tendon , investigator design multi-centre , randomize , placebo-controlled efficacy trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age patient 45 70 year 2 . Acute onset shoulder symptom traumatic event ( kind sudden stretch , pull , fall , impact , shoulder associate onset symptom ) 3 . Shoulder symptom relate rotator cuff tear = pain laterally shoulder and/or painful motion arc abduction flexion 4 . MRI document full thickness supraspinatus ( ssp ) tear 5 . Willingness operative treatment participate trial 1 . Traumatic event shoulder due criminal act violence legal consequence 2 . A delay 4 month onset symptom trauma day intervention 3 . A large MRI document full thickness rotator cuff tear , sagittal tear size level footprint large 3cm 4 . Total width infraspinatus ( isp ) subscapularis ( ssc ) tear 5 . MRI document fully dislocate biceps tendon ( biceps groove ) concomitant subscapularis tear 6 . Positive clinical rotatory lag sign ( ER1 lag ( &gt; 10 degree ) , lift lag ( involuntary drop back ) , horn blower lag ( involuntary internal rotation forearm support elevated position ) ) 7 . Marked fatty degeneration cuff muscle ( Fuchs/Goutallier grade 2 ) 8 . Radiographically MRI document concomitant fracture line involve extremity bony avulsion torn tendon dislocation humeral head acromioclavicular joint . 9 . Concomitant clinically detectable motoric nerve injury affect shoulder 10 . Radiographically document severe osteoarthritis glenohumeral joint , SamilsonPrieto 2 11 . Noncongruency glenohumeral joint radiograph ( Hamada stage 2 ) 12 . Clinical stiffness glenohumeral joint ( severely limit passive range motion : glenohumeral external rotation &lt; 30 degree , abduction stabilize scapula &lt; 60 degree ) 13 . Previous surgery affect shoulder ( affect clavicle , scapula upper third humerus ) 14 . Earlier sonographic MRI find rotator cuff tear 15 . Previous symptom ipsilateral shoulder require conservative treatment ( glucocorticosteroid injection and/or physiotherapy ) deliver health care professional last five year 16 . Systemic glucocorticosteroid antimetabolite medication last 5 year 17 . Ongoing treatment malignancy 18 . ASA classification 3 4 19 . Patient 's inability understand write spoken Finnish , Norwegian Swedish 20 . History alcoholism , drug abuse , psychological emotional problem likely jeopardise inform consent 21 .
