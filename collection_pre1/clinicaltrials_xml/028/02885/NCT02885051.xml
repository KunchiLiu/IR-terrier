	<brief_title>Evaluation Pain Preterm Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The premature newborns hospitalize several week expose significant number nursing procedure painful stressful medical . Repeated pain neonatal period may negative consequence short / long term . The diagnosis pain remain difficult base hetero-assessment involve use validate scale . The PIPP-R scale ( Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised ) appear complete best validate scale composite ( behavior item , vegetative contextual ) . However , rarely use routine care France . Alternatives clinical scoring pain level describe , particular analysis variability heart rate [ VHR ] HFVI index ( High Frequency Variability Index ) skin conductance . The analysis spectral component high frequency HFVI would indicator parasympathetic activity . The HFVI compare EDIN scale , purely behavioral level , propose chronic pain marker . Skin conductance would stress marker reflect variation sympathetic system . These technique currently market routine use . However , method compare NIPE ( Newborn Infant parasympathetic Evaluation ) , assess HFVI index , compare validate scale procedural acute pain ( PIPP-R ) . It seem important , disseminate method , explore consistency technique validate scale , acceptability nurse .</detailed_description>
