	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) incompletely understood recurrent epithelial injury occur evokes coagulation cascade . Thrombin produce result express IPF patient , may important propagate disease activity . We aim recruit patient IPF complete FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan pre post manipulation coagulation cascade assess role biological pathway disease activity . Previous study institution demonstrate increased FDG avidity lung patient IPF ( assess use FDG PET scan ) date cell pathways responsible signal identify thus need exploration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients IPF meet inclusion criterion ( none exclusion criterion ) assess invite participate . They undergo baseline assessment lung function , 6 minute walk test health quality assessment . Blood test assess pro-coagulant state individual . They undergo baseline FDG PET scan follow manipulation coagulation cascade 24 day ( +/- 3 day ) dabigatran . They complete second FDG PET , health quality assessment blood test demonstrate target engagement .</detailed_description>
