	<brief_summary>The First Human ( FIH ) study separate two part : - The first part Single Ascending Dose ( SAD ) , double-blinded , randomized placebo-controlled , include 8 cohort 8 subject ( 2 placebo 6 active drug ) . - The second part food effect cohort open-labelled , randomize fed/fasted cross-over design . The main objective study confirm safety , tolerability Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) P218 healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A FIH Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability PK P218</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide two part : Part A This double-blind randomise , placebo-controlled , parallel group , ascend dose study comprise eight fast cohort ( 8 volunteer ) receive single ascend dose ( SAD ) P218 ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic profile . Each subject participate one dose group receive one dose study drug . In cohort , 2 6 subject randomize placebo P218 , respectively . The data obtain cohort undergo formal review Safety Review Team ( SRT ) . SRT confirm safe proceed next dose/cohort . Part B This pilot food effect evaluation . Once predicted human efficacious concentration P218 safe exposure window ( least 3-fold targeted therapeutic exposure order account possible increase exposure food ) achieve Part A , new cohort 8 subject ( receive active drug ) evaluate food effect open-label , randomize fed/fasted crossover design . Subjects participate food effect cohort randomize two single dose session ( fed/fasted ) . The second dose administer washout period least 5x observed human half-life ( T1/2 ) , confirm PK data available relevant dos Part A . Primary objective : - To investigate safety tolerability single escalate oral dos P218 administer healthy volunteer ( men Women Non Child Bearing Potential ( WNCBP ) ) fast condition . Secondary objective : - To describe pharmacokinetics P218 major glucuronide metabolite ( P218 acyl glucuronide ) healthy volunteer ( men WNCBP ) administration single escalate oral dos - To investigate effect high fat meal pharmacokinetics safety/tolerability P218 . This study incorporate use adaptive design . All anticipate dosing level adjust accordance PK , safety tolerability data collect decision make time-point .</detailed_description>
