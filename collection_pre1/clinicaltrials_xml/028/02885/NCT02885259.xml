	<detailed_description>Multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN ) chronic immune mediate neuropathy , affect patient relatively young age necessitate treatment immunoglobulin ( Ig ) improve maintain muscle strength . Subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( SCIG ) therapy MMN equally efficacious intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , may self-administered may induce few systemic adverse reaction . However , limit subcutaneous infusion volume reduce bioavailability , necessitate multiple infusion site , frequent treatment , dose adjustment achieve pharmacokinetic equivalence . This issue particular MMN relatively high frequent dos necessary maintain long-term improvement muscle strength . Recombinant human hyaluronidase ( rHuPH20 ) increase subcutaneous tissue permeability facilitate dispersion absorption , enable subcutaneous administration high ( monthly ) dose Ig . If treatment HyQvia least equally effective safe compare conventional Ig treatment , HyQvia could become preferred treatment option patient MMN may attractive benefit patient mode administration . Objective : The primary objective study safety tolerability HyQvia patient MMN compare conventional intravenous , documenting : - Side effect use diary 10 cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) scale measure headache nausea . - Biochemical test ( Hemoglobin , haptoglobin , reticulocyte count , lactate dehydrogenase , bilirubin , DAT ) haemolytic anemia 3-7 day last IVIG/SCIG infusion , enrolment period 3-7 day last HyQvia infusion treatment period . - Anti- hyaluronidase antibody titer after/during HyQvia treatment . Together mentioned test parameter point 2 , time 30ml ( equal three tube ) drawn . - Patient satisfaction product 10 cm VAS scale . The secondary objective determine efficacy treatment HyQvia patient MMN : - Disability , measure Guy 's Neurological Disability Scale self-evaluation scale ; - Function , measure nine hole peg test ( 9-HPT ) 40 meter walk test ( 40-MWT ) ; - Muscle strength , measure manual muscle test hand-held dynamometry . Study design : HyQvia MMN study prospective , uncontrolled single-blind open-label study 20 patient IVIG duration 48 60 week consist : 1 . Enrolment period 12 24 week ' duration patient treat accord regular maintenance treatment regimen IVIG , visit outpatient clinic every 6 week . 2 . Treatment period 9 month ' duration patient treat HyQvia , use dose enrolment period visit outpatient clinic start 6 , 12 , 24 36 week . 3 . During study , dose may increase patient ' function daily life worsening : score either upper low limb score Guy 's Neurological Disability Scale score least two motor activity self- evaluation scale increase 1 point muscle strength hand-held dynamometry worsen 50 % least two clinically affect muscle muscle group . If patient improve increase Ig dose treatment period investigator decide stop maintenance treatment HyQvia restart previous treatment period minimal 3 month . HyQvia administrate patient ' routine setting -at home hospital- help nurse train use HyQvia . The patient carefully monitor potential adverse sign throughout study period well anti- hyaluronidase antibody induction . Study population : From outpatient clinic UMC Utrecht , 20 patient MMN currently maintenance treatment IVIG select study safety , tolerability efficacy HyQvia . Intervention : 20 MMN patient , currently maintenance treatment IVIG , treat HyQvia 9 month ' period use dose IVIG enrolment period . Main study parameters/endpoints : The follow main study parameter use assess tolerability efficacy HyQvia MMN patient : - Disability use Guy 's Neurologic Disability Scale self- evaluation scale . - Function evaluate 9-HPT 40 MWT . - Muscle strength measure manual muscle test use Medical Research Council scale ( MRC ) . Hand-held dynamometry perform selection muscle muscle group MRC score &lt; 5 time . Grip strength hand measure use hand-held dynamometer . - Adverse event use 10 cm long VAS analogue scale headache nausea well diary , provided patient visit clinic . - IgM anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody titer enrolment visit final visit . Biochemical test haemolytic anemia 3-7 day last IVIG/SCIG infusion enrolment period 3-7 day last HyQvia infusion treatment period . - Anti-hyaluronidase antibody titer 12 week 3 9 month HyQvia treatment . Together mentioned test parameter point 5 , time 30ml ( equal three tube ) drawn . - Patient satisfaction product 10 cm VAS scale . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk negligible burden minimal patient enrol study , assess tolerability efficacy HyQvia MMN patient . Patients participate study , assign 6 grouped evaluation fix interval : filling diary , evaluation scale , 3 blood sample , visit outpatient clinic also evaluate routine physical examination . The two component HyQvia , Subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( SCIG ) recombinant human hyaluronidase ( rHuPH20 ) , know safe already apply primary secondary immunodeficiency disorder , multiple myeloma chronic lymphatic leukemia . SCIG therapy MMN , safe equally efficacious intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . Furthermore , may self-administered may induce few systemic adverse reaction IVIG . Recombinant human hyaluronidase ( rHuPH20 ) , increase subcutaneous tissue absorption enable high dos subcutaneous administration Ig , decrease number infusion site , result less frequent treatment dose adjustment .</detailed_description>
