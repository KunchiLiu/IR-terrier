	<brief_title>The Effect Broccoli Sprout Extract Allergy Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis common illness suffer among US Veterans . Despite availability medication , many patient fail get adequate control symptom especially high pollutant area . Southern California air pollutant , like diesel exhaust particle may act adjuvant allergens lead exaggerated allergic response certain individual . These individual may lack adequate Glutathione transferase activity ; necessary protect cell pollutant induce oxidative stress . Sulforaphane show protect oxidative stress . The investigator hypothesize consumption food contain high level sulforaphane beneficial US Veterans GST deficiencies suffer allergic rhinitis . In investigator ' preliminary data , investigator discover administration broccoli sprout extract rich sulforaphane lead diminish nasal inflammatory reaction bring diesel exhaust particle though sufficient patient number prove association GST deficiency . The investigator propose 3 week randomize clinical trial compare broccoli sprout extract consumption nasal corticosteroid administration subject allergic rhinitis undergo Timothy , Bermuda Johnson grass nasal challenge . In Aims 1 2 , investigator compare clinical ( nasal symptom score peak nasal inspiratory flow ) laboratory ( inflammatory cytokine , eosinophil cationic protein , tryptase ) measurements four group : nasal corticosteroid , broccoli sprout extract , nasal corticosteroid plus broccoli sprout extract , placebo . Aim 3 focus exploratory genetic analysis 3 glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) gene determine correlation exist inability produce GST enzyme response broccoli sprout extract . At conclusion study , investigator gain knowledge patient benefit anti-oxidant nutritional supplementation treat allergic rhinitis .</detailed_description>
