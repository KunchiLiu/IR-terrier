	<brief_summary>Parabolic flight ground-based condition weightlessness ( 0G ) create long enough safely test change human perception behavior . In addition 0G period , parabolic flight generates equal duration period 1.8G , present another unique opportunity test responses hypergravity back 1G . Spatial orientation perception critical subsystem use central nervous system control vehicle complex system high-level integrative function . Evidence space flight research demonstrate spatial orientation alter transition gravito-inertial force level ( Clément 2011 ; Clément &amp; Reschke 2008 ) , transition correspond mission phase particularly critical crew safety mission success . Accurate perception self-in-space motion self-motion relative object critical successful operation involve motor control e.g . extra-vehicule activity piloting spacecraft . To date , limited operational evidence alteration cause functional impact mission-critical operation control capability . Immediately space flight , crewmembers report degree disorientation/perceptual illusion , often accompany nausea ( symptoms motion sickness ) , frequently manifest lack coordination , particularly locomotion The hypothesis alteration sensorimotor performance induce inverted vision gravity depend : maximum alteration hypergravity , intermediary alteration normal gravity , minimal alteration weightlessness .</brief_summary>
