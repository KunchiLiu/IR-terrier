	<brief_summary>Local excision early rectal cancer prove feasibility oncological safety . Indeed , lymph node invasion exceed 1 % 10 % pT1sm1 pT1sm2 rectal carcinoma respectively . Two procedure currently perform early cancer well preneoplastic lesion . Transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) , proven superiority traditional transanal excision , surgical approach associate 92 % R0 excision rate , survival comparable radical anterior resection low morbidity . It consist full-thickness excision . The second procedure recently introduce technique : endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , encompass mucosa submucosa . ESD enable endoscopists achieve high en bloc resection rate standard mucosectomy associate 88 % R0 resection rate , decrease 65 % subgroup European series . Though promising , role ESD remain controversial malignant lesion publish report . There therefore 2 different technique 2 different dissection ( full-thickness vs. submucosal ) achieve oncological treatment . So far , one retrospective single-center study include 63 patient compare TEM ESD early rectal cancer without find difference 2 procedure , available study compare TEM ESD type colorectal tumor . The aim present research compare ESD TEM early rectal cancer rectal adenomas short- long-term outcome .</brief_summary>
