	<brief_title>Nerve Burial Preventing Neuralgia After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior knee pain common total knee arthroplasty . The incision necessarily travel path cutaneous nerve - branch saphenous nerve . Historically , effort make separate branch bury away surgical scar . It note patient develop painful neuroma , resect result pain free knee . Investigators try study identification , ligation , proper burial nerve prevent development neuralgia compare typical surgical approach ignores nerve branch completely .</detailed_description>
