	<brief_summary>Rett syndrome ( RTT ) genetic encephalopathy typical form cause mutation gene MECP2 . It genetically heterogeneous pathology . CDKL5 FOXG1 recently discover involved form RTT . However , least 5 % typical form atypical form link 3 gene know involved disease . The purpose study identify new gene involve molecular etiology typical atypical form RTT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Genes Involved Molecular Etiology Rett Syndrome Through DNA Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Search pathogenic chromosomal imbalance comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) DNA microarrays do group patient typical atypical form RTT without know mutation MECP2 , CDKL5 et FOXG1B gene . After imbalance confirmation qPCR , pathogenic potential segmental aneusomy assign accord interpretation aCGH technique-dedicated DECEPHER , BACH GVD databases . Analysis parent allow distinguish inherit polymorphic variant potentially deleterious new imbalance . In case new imbalance , bioinformatics approach look candidate gene possibly confirm classic mutation screening ( sequence PCR ) typical atypical case RTT present cohort . The identification new gene involve RTT ameliorate molecular diagnosis disease genetic counseling family . This project allow progression comprehension physiopathological mechanism cerebral development abnormality</detailed_description>
