Research show pre-operative health status strongly predict outcomes include physical function hospitalization length hip replacement surgery . Frail patient , particular , great risk poor post-operative outcome could potentially benefit intervention target improvement health status prior undergo hip replacement surgery . Partnering Young Men 's Christian Association ( YMCA ) multi-disciplinary team healthcare provider , pilot trial examine feasibility multi-modal intervention frail patient include supervised exercise program , vitamin D protein supplementation , medication review .

	<brief_title>Fit-Hips : Getting Fit Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : The propose study pilot randomize control trial compare pre-operative multi-modal intervention standard care among pre-frail/frail patient undergoing total hip replacement surgery . Pre-frail ( score 1 2 ) frail ( score 3-5 ; Fried Frailty Phenotype ) patient , ≥ 65 year undergoing elective unilateral total hip replacement least 3 month recruit practice 6 orthopedic surgeon ( Hamilton Arthroplasty Group ) . A physiotherapist research assistant ( RA ) conduct eligibility screen Regional Joint Assessment Program ( Hamilton Health Sciences ) appointment decision operate make ( 3-10 month prior surgery ) . Patients renal insufficiency , neuromuscular disorder , active cancer unstable medical condition exclude . Stratified block randomization use randomly allocate participant intervention usual care arm study . The allocation sequence computer generate use Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS ) 9.3 . Once study RA confirm patient 's eligibility , obtain consent , RA fax participant ' eligibility form , consent contact off-site research member randomize participant base random allocation sequence generate . Then RA call participant inform fall intervention control group arrange first visit . Multi-Modal Frailty Intervention ( 3-10 month ) Exercise : A Registered Kinesiologist develop individualized exercise program schedule appointment patient home include goal set discussion . Participants offer free YMCA membership participate IN Motion program.The IN Motion program design old adult include gentle fit , hydrotherapy walk fit class along health education session . Participants teach monitor heart rate level exertion use Borg Rating Perceived Exertion 10-point Scale . All participant encourage exercise least 3 time per week 45-60 minute either home and/or YMCA IN Motion class . The home exercise incorporate aerobic , resistance training , flexibility balance component . Patients provide asked keep exercise log-book . Cognitive-behavioral Change Strategy education : Cognitive Behavioral Change Strategies ( CBCS ) may effective way facilitate coaching strategy increase participant exercise level . In current study , module present participant event express barrier exercise . These barrier vary base : individual , environment , previous exercise behavior . Throughout intervention , CBC perform administered Kinesiologist home visit prior participant schedule surgery . The administration modules dependent challenge participant express relation exercise ( i.e. , lack time , motivation , social support , etc. ) . A definition strategy give participant ; Kinesiologist work worksheet participant . Also , study kinesiologist provide education participant exercise , hip arthroplasty osteoarthritis . Protein Supplement : Participants provide twice-daily supplement ( contain 20 gram protein , 1.5 g β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate /serving ) take meal activity day within 3-hours exercise . Vitamin D : All participant intervention arm provide supply Vitamin D3 ( 1000 IU/day tablet ) duration intervention period . Medication Review : After randomization , geriatrician review medication patient intervention arm provide write recommendation participant 's family doctor . Control arm : Patients control arm receive usual care may include recommendation attend fitness class surgery ; however patient receive intensive assessment/intervention Kinesiologist intervention component . Control participants ask pre-operatively post-operatively indicate whether exercise , take protein vitamin supplement . For participant intervention control group , 1 ) monitor YMCA attendance 2 ) instruct completion dietary intake log indicate type food amount four-day period order calculate energy micronutrient consumption . Then RA call participant collect food intake .</detailed_description>
