	<brief_title>Dual Time Point FDG PET-MR Imaging Optimization Evaluation Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging Procedures : If agree take part study , come clinic standard-of-care MRI FDG PET/CT scan . The contrast drug inject vein arm standard IV minute . One ( 1 ) hour receive contrast drug , move FDG PET-CT scanner brain whole body scan , take 30 minute . This standard scanning time point . After , standard-of-care MRI scan brain . This MRI take 45 minute . You come back clinic 2 FDG PET-CT scan 4 - 5 hour 7 - 8 hour receive contrast drug . The scanning time 20 - 30 minute time . These research scan . You must fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) least 6 hour scan . When allow eat , eat low carbohydrate , high protein meal ( example , bake chicken side asparagus , broccoli , mushroom , green vegetable/salad ) . You also drink 6-8 glass water ( glass 8 ounce ) . The study staff give handout specific diet instruction must follow PET scan . Information also collect medical record . Length Study Participation : Your active participation study last PET-CT scan complete . This investigational study . The FDG PET-CT MRIs deliver use FDA approve commercially available method . Comparing result different imaging time point give contrast drug investigational . Up 20 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
