	<brief_title>Prevalence Myocardial Injury Gastrointestinal Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM : The aim study determine prevalence myocardial injury gastrointestinal surgery patient establish baseline data allow evaluation potential benefit RIPC ( remote ischemic preconditioning ) patient Significance : In available literature one study include 51 patient focus postoperative arrhythmia colorectal surgery . We think study important establish specifically prevalence myocardial injury cohort patient measure future research RIPC protective method could produce significant effect . Study Design : Prospective Observational cohort Study Study Objectives : To determine prevalence myocardial injury patient undergoing gastrointestinal surgery Patients Locations : Patients older 18 year undergo major resectional gastrointestinal surgery Galway University Hospitals ( UCHG , Mayo university Hospital ) , The Midland Regional Hospital , Tullamore Letterkenny University Hospital ask join study consider eligible informed consent information handout provide . Protocol : After informed consent patient ' pre-op demographic data , co-morbidities , blood include troponin ECG record . Serum troponin level measure daily first 72 hour 12-lead electrocardiogram perform 48 hour post-surgery . There 1 year flow candidate Data Handling : The data hospital keep locally patient allocate number later data analysis . The pooled data analyze use secure computer NUI Galway research facility building . No patient ' name identifier associate data except study number assign earlier Primary Outcome : Prevalence myocardial injury compare pre post-op troponin ECGs . The diagnosis myocardial injury determine cardiologist examine troponin ECGs result use SAVES trial criterion ( 5 ) . Perioperative Myocardial injury include silent myocardial infarction determine study cardiologist upon examination study ECGs troponin result . The diagnosis myocardial injury require presence least two follow : 1 . Characteristic ischemic symptom last least 20 minute 2 . Electrocardiographic change include acute ST elevation follow appearance Q wave loss R wave , development new leave bundle branch block , new persistent T wave inversion last least 24 hour new ST segment depression persist 24 hour 3 . Positive troponin T ( &gt; 0.1 ng/ml ) troponin I ( &gt; 0.1 mg/ml ) level characteristic rise fall level 4 . New-onset arrhythmia ( ventricular supraventricular tachycardia fibrillation ) associate rise troponin level 5 . Alternatively , myocardial injury record patient develops sudden unexpected cardiac death involve cardiac arrest symptom suggestive myocardial ischemia accompany presumably new ST elevation new leave bundle branch block and/or fresh thrombus coronary angiography and/or post-mortem , death occur blood sample could obtain time appearance cardiac troponin I T blood . Other Data : - Age - Gender - Procedure type - Renal Profile ( Renal impairment consider interpret Troponin value ) - ECG - Ethnicity - Diabetes - BP - History Cardiac event - Other Comorbidities - Smoking history - NYHA classification ( New York Heart Association ) - Medication time consent ( Blood pressure heart rate control medication ) Exclusion Criteria - Documented Pre-op Myocardium Injury - Refused unable give inform consent - Laparoscopic fundoplication - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery - Appendectomy surgery - Hernia repair surgery Sample Size : This prospective study determine incidence myocardial injury gastrointestinal surgical patient . There exist data upon base sample size calculation . We estimate data 100 patient provide sufficient sample size generate reasonably robust incidence estimate . However , include center recruit patient include analysis Statistical Analysis : Statsdirect use analysis study result Budget No additional budget study need test require routinely request within study clinical setting . The analysis management study perform clinical research fellow fund National University Ireland Galway Conflict interest : Study team declare conflict interest</detailed_description>
