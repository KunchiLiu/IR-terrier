	<brief_summary>Palpitation common complaint . Patients frequently feel symptom despite normal rhythm symptom . I see many patient improve significantly treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) . It may gastritis provokes feel discomfort subsequently start feel palpitation . On search literature I find study investigated effect PPI 's palpitation . Therefore I propose study investigator randomize people palpitation normal heart rate ( arrhythmia ) apparent cause anxiety clear illness receive either PPI placebo . The result help investigate improvement true result positive provide simple treatment common problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Proton Pump Inhibitors Palpitations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Two hundred patient palpitation clear cause symptom randomize receive either PPI placebo one month . At base line investigate rule arrhythmia document normal heart rate ( le 110 beat per minute ) ECG show normal sinus rhythm mild sinus tachycardia ( Less 110 per minute ) symptom . Obvious cause anxiety due stressful event organic cause anemia thyroid disorder also rule . Patient agree participate study ask sign inform consent . A baseline questionnaire symptom fill . They randomize treatment either PPI placebo night time . After 10 day treatment contact questioned regard symptom . The two group compare see improvement symptom treatment . Studying group The study umbrella JCC group . Primary investigator Dr Munir Zaqqa Dr Ismail Hamam Support require Pharmaceutical company contact provide 120 packet 30 tab PPI possible packet similar match placebo support study Study criterion inclusion 1 . Persons palpitation clear cause age 16 year consent study include 2 . Clear cause exclude true arrhythmia SVT VT frequent premature atrial ventricular contraction organic cause thyroid disorder , anemia ( hg le 11 g/dl ) obvious anxiety disorder 3 . Arrhythmia exclude ECG show sinus rhythm sinus tachycardia episodes measurement heart rate reliable method symptom show regular heart rate le 120 beat per minute . 4 . Patient randomize either PPI placebo take one table night time 5 . Patients provide 2 week supply evaluate 10 day see symptom improve 6 . The two group compare use statistical method see difference improvement . Expected harm : PPI 's generally safe medication . Side effect rare generally mild . They include nausea , stomach pain , diarrhea , constipation headache . Very rarely allergic reaction occur hive , difficulty breathe swell face lip . Benefit patient : Patients randomize either group may experience benefit due medication even placebo use . There financial benefit participate study . The result study use help patient future similar symptom</detailed_description>
