	<brief_summary>This feasibility study ass use wide field adaptive optic optical coherence tomography ( WF-AO-OCT ) determine whether structural difference peripheral retina participant diagnose diabetic retinopathy compare healthy control group . This study conduct abbreviated IDE . The investigator analyze data use descriptive statistic . Risks related light exposure manage ensure exposure WF-AO-OCT light source well maximum permissible limit safe exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adaptive optic ( AO ) optical technique correct natural aberration ( optical imperfection ) eye . Since first described 1997 , use successfully enhance visualization retinal tissue , particular , human photoreceptor mosaic . Previous study use AO human eye contribute considerable advancement understand vision ocular pathology . An AO system send pattern light eye balance eye 's inherent imperfection . This lead good image provide good light focus natural lens eye . The AO system measure light return eye typical clinically accept optical coherence tomography scan laser ophthalmoscope system . A schematic AO system consist light input , deformable/adaptive mirror modifies shape light enter exit eye , detector system capture analyze return light eye . The device use feasibility study test ensure light output within ANSI limit safe ocular exposure capable obtain useful image peripheral retina normal subject . Diabetic retinopathy represent common cause vision loss work age adult . Vision loss relate two manifestation advance diabetic retinopathy : proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . PDR occur vascular perfusion retina compromise compensatory signal include expression vascular endothelial growth factor cause neovascularization surface retina . These abnormal vessel cause vision loss either bleed vitreous contract lead retinal detachment . DME occur vascular leakage result swell macular tissue cause central vision loss . While DME affect macula ( area typically image use OCT ) , PDR much frequently find peripheral retina typically image traditional OCT device . In recently year , wide field fluorescein angiography allow insight relationship DME , PDR status retinal blood vessel within macula retinal periphery . WF-AO-OCT potential provide similar complementary structural detail retinal tissue vasculature within macula retinal periphery . The advantage WF-AO-OCT non-contact , non-invasive image technology easy use , faster less invasive compare fluorescein angiography entail intravenous injection fluorescein , require skilled ophthalmic photographer take 10-20 minute perform . By image participant previously undergone wide field fluorescein angiography standard care , investigator able compare information obtain use WF-AO-OCT determine sensitivity identify specific vascular morphological finding associate PDR DME .</detailed_description>
