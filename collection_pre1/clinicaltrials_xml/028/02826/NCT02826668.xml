	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate impact lumbar spine ultrasound success rate efficiency labor epidural placement lateral position . The investigator hypothesize ultrasound image lumbar spine woman early labor yield similar ultrasound result do immediately prior epidural placement . The investigator also hypothesize use ultrasound landmark mark depth epidural space estimate facilitate epidural placement term efficiency ( time require placement ) efficacy pain relief .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Lumbar Ultrasound Resident Learning Curve Lateral Labor Epidural Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study demonstrate significant benefit pre-procedural ultrasound epidural placement anesthesia resident , particularly perform obese population . To investigator knowledge , however , study evaluate teach modality lumber epidural technique lateral position . Formalizing educational process less frequently perform , highly technical critical skill may profound impact trainee learn curve , may enhance overall success efficiency epidural placement , quality analgesia provide , safety procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pregnant Subjects pregnant woman 18 year old early labor ( cervix dilate &lt; 5 cm pain visual analog score ( VAS ) &lt; 3 , ) request consultation anesthesia team anticipate epidural pain relief . absolute contraindication neuraxial anesthesia include patient refusal uncorrected coagulopathy infection skin site epidural placement increase intracranial pressure , untreated hemodynamic instability . In addition , patient history scoliosis spine surgery body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 40 kg/m2 allergy local anesthetic , allergy opioids exclude . Anesthesiologists Inclusion criterion : Anesthesia resident fellows perform epidural technique pregnant subject agree part study . Anesthesia resident fellows prior experience lumbar epidural technique , define place 20 great lumbar epidural residency prior enrollment . Exclusion criterion : individual want participate study .</criteria>
