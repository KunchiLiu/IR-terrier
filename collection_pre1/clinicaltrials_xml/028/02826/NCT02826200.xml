	<brief_summary>The RETORIC study prospective cohort study primary aim ass incidence independent predictor reduce leaflet motion valve thrombosis TAVI procedure use multimodality image strategy comprise cardiac CT , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) . As secondary aim ass incidence stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) patient reduce leaflet motion and/or thrombosis compare normal leaflet function . In addition randomize patient reduce leaflet motion and/or valve thrombosis single antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation therapy versus standard therapy . The primary outcome nest randomized trial presence reduce leaflet motion and/or valve thrombosis 4 month , secondary outcome presence ischemic change brain demonstrate MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) establish treatment severe aortic stenosis patient non-eligible surgical aortic valve replacement . Prosthetic valve thrombosis define thrombus attach part prosthesis , cause infection . This may result valve dysfunction and/or thromboembolisation . Most patient prosthetic valve thrombosis asymptomatic , whereas patient present stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . Obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis may lead overt congestive heart failure . Currently , strict guideline recommendation regard therapeutic anticoagulation TAVI . Per institutional protocol dual antiplatelet therapy use first 6 month THV implantation single antiplatelet therapy use 6 month . Diagnosing transcatheter heart valve ( THV ) thrombosis clinical importance even asymptomatic patient , may lead thromboembolism cause THV dysfunction . Therefore , early diagnosis treatment may prevent future TIA stroke THV dysfunction . Current standard clinical practice guideline inconsistent regard antithrombotic treatment patient underwent TAVI procedure . Accordingly , determine true incidence potential causative factor THV thrombosis great importance would facilitate investigation large clinical trial order develop optimal antithrombotic treatment patient follow TAVI procedure . The RETORIC study prospective cohort study primary aim ass incidence independent predictor reduce leaflet motion valve thrombosis TAVI procedure use multimodality image strategy comprise cardiac CT , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) . As secondary aim ass incidence stroke TIA reduce leaflet motion thrombosis compare normal leaflet function . In addition randomise patient reduce leaflet motion unchanged standard therapy versus single antiplatelet plus oral anticoagulation therapy . The primary outcome nest randomized trial presence novel ischemic lesion brain demonstrate MRI . Findings RETORIC study may alter current post-TAVI diagnostic work treatment algorithm regard anticoagulant antiplatelet therapy . In total 200 patient underwent undergoing TAVI procedure include RETORIC study . The institutional standard care post-TAVI antithrombotic medication consist six month dual antiplatelet treatment clopidogrel aspirin follow lifelong aspirin therapy . Currently , TAVI procedure number institution approximately 80 patients/year . Therefore , reach enrolment goal 200 patient , subject enrol two cohort . Cohort A : Patients underwent TAVI procedure past select Semmelweis TAVI Registry . For cohort median TAVI-to-CT time calculate . Cohort B : Patients undergo TAVI procedure enrol consecutively . In group imaging perform 3 month prosthesis implantation every patient . Four-dimensional cardiac CT , TTE brain MRI data obtain patient . In case cardiac CT identifies reduce leaflet motion THV thrombosis TEE exam perform even asymptomatic patient patient enter randomize control trial . Patients randomize two group : Group 1 , standard therapy plus oral anticoagulant therapy ; Group 2 , standard therapy . After 4 month patient undergo four-dimensional cardiac CT , TTE brain MRI . The primary outcome randomize trial presence reduce leaflet motion/valve thrombosis , secondary outcome presence ischemic lesion brain MRI image .</detailed_description>
