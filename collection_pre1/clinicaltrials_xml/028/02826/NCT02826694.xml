	<detailed_description>The investigator enroll perform whole exome sequence two cohort patient . One cohort consist two hundred newborn know condition whose parent recruit mother 's pregnancy . The second cohort include two hundred infant child age five year diagnose condition include condition detect standard newborn screen phenylketonuria inborn error metabolism , hear loss rare condition may fit criterion newborn screening future . Parents introduce study clinician study recruiter . Those agree enroll Phase I review online decision guide offer study visit conduct genetic counselor obtain informed consent genomic sequencing child . Parents consent child 's genome sequence see child 's birth convenient pre-arranged time duplicate saliva sample collect child one sample send BioSpecimen Processing ( BSP ) Facility Dr. Jonathan Berg 's laboratory sequencing send Molecular Genetics Laboratory ( MGL ) DNA extraction storage need clinical confirmation . Results return diagnostic ( Diagnosed cohort ) medically actionable disorder childhood ( cohort ) .
