	<detailed_description>This phase I/IIa , randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled , multiple-ascending dose study conduct single site . The study plan include approximately 46 evaluable subject Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( HbA1c 7-11 % ) Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease ( liver fat content &gt; = 8 % ) metformin monotherapy Three initial cohort plan : - Cohort 1 : 6 subject receive AZD4076 4 subject receive placebo - Cohort 2 : 12 subject receive AZD4076 10 subject receive placebo - Cohort 3 : 10 subject receive AZD4076 10 subject receive placebo , possibility add additional subject drop-out rate higher expect . Pending review SRC , additional 2 cohort , consist 18 evaluable subject may include study . The plan study consist screen visit , follow 12 subsequent study visit . There total three residential period : ( 1 ) Loading phase treatment ( visit 2 , day -4 14 ) , ( 2 ) maintenance phase treatment ( visit 6 , day 42-43 ) , ( 3 ) 8 week post-first dose study drug ( visit 9 , day 53-56 ) . Dosing study drug take place day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 loading phase ; day 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 maintenance phase . Following maintenance phase , subject four follow-up visit . Study Objectives : The primary objective clinical trial investigate safety tolerability AZD4076 follow subcutaneous administration multiple ascend dos ; assess effect AZD4076 whole body insulin sensitivity use hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp tracer technique ; assess effect AZD4076 liver fat content use magnetic resonance imaging . Secondary objective trial characterize multiple dose PK AZD4076 longmer shortmer metabolite assess time require reach steady state degree accumulation ; ass efficacy AZD4076 24-hour glucose ; assess effect AZD4076 homeostatic model assessment insulin resistant ( HOMA-IR ) Matsuda index . Study Population : Subjects participate study adult male females non-child bearing potential , 18-70 year age , body mass index 23-40 kg/m2 , diagnose T2DM inadequately control ( HbA1C 7-11 % ) stable metformin regimen , hepatic steatosis ( define liver fat content &gt; =8 % per MRI ) . Duration treatment : The screen visit occur within 42 day prior administration study drug . Total length treatment period 6 week . The treatment period divide two phase : loading phase , participant receive study drug every day 9 day ( Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 9 ) ; thereafter subject enter maintenance phase , dose occur weekly four week ( Days 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 42 ) . To ensure safety , subject follow approximately 5 month post last dose study drug . Investigational product , dosage mode administration : The study utilize two study drug : AZD4076 placebo . Both drug administer subcutaneously abdomen . Safety analysis : The key outcome safety analysis : adverse event , vital sign , safety laboratory parameter , ECGs , telemetry ; structure neurological physical examination , well injection site assessment . Pharmacodynamic parameter derive data generate clamp procedure , MRI , HOMA , OGTT 24-hour glucose AUC . For pharmacokinetic parameter , plasma urine concentration AZD4076 metabolite measure</detailed_description>
