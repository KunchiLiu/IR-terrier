	<brief_summary>Pedicular screw become gold standard intervertebral fixation require degenerative , scoliotic , tumoral pathology fracture . Several pedicular screw method exist . The free hand pedicular screwing require high learn curve , consequence , high malposition rate . The place pedicular screw fluoroscopic control common technique reproducible accessible . It two dimensional imaging technique . The profile incidence level spine mostly use spot vertebral pedicle direction screw sagittal plane . However , real control direction pedicular screw horizontal frontal plane . The screw malposition rate less important 'free hand ' technique remain none less significant . Furthermore , fluoroscopy irradiate imaging technique , patient staff . New revolutionary technique tridimensional navigation per-operatory tomodensitometry appear last year . The technique give best result use concommitantly . The material advantage precise . The pedicular screw malposition rate minimal three-dimensional localisation . However , system require qualified staff expose patient nursing team high radiation level . The cost high surgery duration globally longer . It thus difficult implement technique belgian hospital . Finally , Pediguard technique appear market . It guide perforation pedicular channel , probe extremity . This probe allow real time measurement electric conductivity tissue cross . The conductivity measure translate sound signal . Because cortical bone low conductivity , probe emit low intensity sound signal . The cancellous bone medium conductivity . Therefore , probe emit medium sound signal . However , event breach pedicular cortical , blood periost high conductibility , probe emit intense , rapid pace , sound signal.The Pediguard technique help thus anticipate cortical effraction , detect proximity cortical wall . It efficient remain relatively expensive . The main objective study determine precision place pedicular screw , without Pediguard system , fluoroscopy .</brief_summary>
