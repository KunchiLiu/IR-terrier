	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease chronic inflammatory bowel disease associate flare remission period . Its etiology unknown specific therapy . CD affect young patient major impact quality life . There population-based study 2.5 million affected patient Europe North America . From data EPIMAD Registry number affect patient France 200 000 . The Crohn 's disease pathogenesis bad know ; It coul result activation gastro-intestinal immune system toward gut microbiota genetically susceptible host . In CD patient important ecologic modification flora excess Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria decrease anti inflammatory bacteria ( Firmicutes ) . In ileum CD patient specific E Coli ( adherent invasive E Colo ) find two third cases.The presence AIEC seem associate variant NOD2 ( result team multiplex family ) . In family least 1 patient CD , healthy first degree relative present high risk ( * 10 ) also develop CD . The primary objective comparison microbiota patient CD , healthy control non genetically link first degree healthy relatives patient CD . The first endpoint Lachnospiraceae rate group . The secondary objective : 1. search association bacterial dysbiosis different genetic background patient CD , first degree healthy relative control . 2. quantification potential invasive bacteria invasive property ( E. coli include adherent-invasive E. coli , Shigella , Salmonella , Yersinia , Campylobacter ) , fecal fungal flora ( Candida albicans , particular ) association genetic serological profile patient CD , healthy relative control subject . 3. study environmental risk factor use questionnaire submit CD patient , healthy relative control subject .</detailed_description>
