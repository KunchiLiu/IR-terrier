	<criteria>Histological proof advance , HER2 negative breast cancer ; Fresh freeze primary tumor sample available metastasis accessible fresh frozen biopsy ; The tumor must BRCA1like , identify Agendia 's RNAbased BRCAness classifier ; Only follow patient may refer BRCA1like test : patient triple negative primary breast cancer ; hormonereceptor positive , HER2negative primary breast cancer patient histological grade III breast cancer ; Breast cancer patient carry BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 germ line mutation . Pretreatment contain anthracycline and/or taxane ( neo ) adjuvant metastatic setting receive , , discuss patient whether justified forego treatment ; Maximum one prior line chemotherapy advance disease . Age ≥ 18 year ; Able willing give write informed consent ; WHO performance status 0 , 1 2 ; Life expectancy ≥ 3 month , allow adequate follow toxicity evaluation antitumor activity ; Measurable evaluable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion ; Minimal acceptable safety laboratory value ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L Platelet count ≥ 150 x 109 /L Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL ( 6.21mmol/L ) Hepatic function define total serum bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 x ULN ( except elevate bilirubin due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ) , ASAT ALAT &lt; 2.5 x ULN &lt; 5 x ULN case liver metastasis Renal function define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( CockcroftGault formula ) ; Negative pregnancy test ( urine/serum ) female patient childbearing potential . Any treatment investigational drug within 28 day prior receive first dose investigational treatment ; within 21 day standard chemotherapy ; within 14 day weekly schedule chemotherapeutic regimen endocrine therapy ; Patients progress previous palliative treatment PARP1inhibitors , platinum compound high dose alkylating agent autologous stem cell rescue , since preclinical anecdotal clinical data breast cancer indicate cancer acquire resistance PARPinhibitors base genetic reversion , epigenetic modification , yet unknown mechanism . Platinumsensitive PARP1inhibitorsensitive patient stop reason progression eligible ; Patients receive highdose alkylating agent autologous stem cell rescue ( neo ) adjuvant setting , unless treatment receive longer 3 year ago ; Pretreatment contain anthracycline and/or taxane , either ( neo ) adjuvant metastatic setting unless treatment indicate ; Women positive pregnancy test ( urine/serum ) and/or breast feeding ; Unreliable contraceptive method .
