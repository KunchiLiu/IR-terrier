The second objective study confirm hypothetic link APSNP CPSNP 1 2 month surgery large population . It hypothesize systematic use DN4 questionnaire postoperative could help detect patient risk CPSNP . Methods : Investigators center recruit SFAR ( French Society Anesthesiology Intensive Care ) research network . The study take place 2 consecutive day center France . Each center agree include many patient could period . All adult patient undergoing inpatient schedule urgent surgery eligible . The study solely observational interfere patient 's care . Preoperative assessment consist collect demographic data ( age , sex , body mass index , type surgery ) well presence preoperative chronic pain localization , preoperative opioid , gabapentin pregabalin consumption . In postoperative , collect follow data : type anesthesia , intra operative ketamine administration , type total dose opioid administer surgery . Pain evaluate least 2 hour surgery within day ( D0 ) day 2 ( D2 ) , 1 ( M1 ) 2 month ( M2 ) surgery . Pain assess use 10-point NPS . If NPS &gt; 0 , neuropathic pain diagnose basis DN4 questionnaire . NCPSP define NPS &gt; 0 positive DN4 ( DN4 ≥ 4 /10 ) ( 11 ) . APSNP CPSNP define D0/D2 DN4≥ 4/10 M1/M2 DN4≥ 4/10 , respectively . The preoperative immediate postoperative ( day 0 day 2 ) data collect one investigator center . The latter data ( 1 2 month surgery ) assess phone research nurse .</detailed_description>
