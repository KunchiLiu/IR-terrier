	<brief_title>Study Assessing Safety Efficacy Combination BL-8040 Pembrolizumab Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients ( COMBAT/KEYNOTE-202 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , phase IIa study subject metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The study include 30 subject unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The study consist two period : - Monotherapy period : One week , BL-8040 administer daily day 1-5 . - Combination therapy : Three week cycle combination BL-8040 administer three time week ( TIW ) pembrolizumab administer every three week . Subjects metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma enrol receive BL-8040 monotherapy five day follow combination treatment BL-8040 pembrolizumab . During monotherapy period , eligible subject receive daily subcutaneous ( SC ) injection BL-8040 ( 1.25 mg/kg ) day 1 - 5 . From Day 8 subject begin combination period consist treatment SC BL-8040 ( 1.25 mg/kg ) three time week ( TIW ) pembrolizumab ( 200mg ) every three week . The combination therapy continue two year , progression , clinical deterioration early termination , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
