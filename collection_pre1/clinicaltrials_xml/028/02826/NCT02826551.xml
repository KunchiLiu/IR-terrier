	<brief_summary>Post-operative pain control follow elective anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction continue hurdle orthopaedic surgeon . This obstacle become particularly problematic first 36 hour operation , patient experience pain peak intensity . Good control pain lead well patient comfort , confidence place weight operative limb improve ability perform critical exercise period improve joint range motion . A variety anesthetic technique employ reduce pain include : cryotherapy , systemic analgesic anti-inflammatory drug , intrathecal , regional blockade peripheral nerve frequently intra-articular injection . Each technique study length mixed overall favorable result . However , author ' experience , femoral nerve blockade , patient continue complain posterior knee pain Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) peri-operative period . Intra-articular injection comprise morphine Na-channel blocker analgesic may curb pain bath posterior capsule anesthetic . However , still large concern amongst orthopaedic surgeon potential harm agent may knee 's healthy articular cartilage surface . The long term effect , include chondrolysis document shoulder short term effect diminish still hesitation among surgeon use form pain blockade . This lead investigator adapt technique isolate posterior capsular injection total knee replacement joint arthroplasty literature , show favorable result low complication risk . The investigator plan study effectiveness technique ACL reconstruction attempt curb amount posterior knee pain decrease overall narcotic use postoperatively limiting exposure native cartilage harmful agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Outcomes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Posterior Capsular Marcaine Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective series consecutive patient undergo primary ACLR recruit preoperative log patient see one two sport medicine fellowship train surgeon within investigator group . Patients undergo primary unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) either bone-patellar bone autograft Achilles tendon allograft include surgeon use similar technique fixation option . After consent participate , subject randomize one two group . Using random number generator , 60 consecutively enrolled patient place appropriate study arm . ( Odd number = Control Group ) ( Even number = Experimental Group ) . Only patient blind arm study belong . Group 1 ( Control ) patient undergo routine arthroscopically assist ACLR surgery standardize postoperative protocol . Group 2 ( Experimental ) patient undergo procedure postoperative protocol Group 1 , addition posterior capsular injection 20 cc Marcaine 0.5 % . There placebo treatment offer surgeon operate room staff blind subject group . Injecting marcaine study perform accordance standard use accord FDA labeling/guidelines . The physician use discretion appropriate location injection posterior capsule knee bring additional risk expect knee injection . At conclusion case , patient receive dry sterile dressing , follow compression wrap hinge knee brace lock extension . No drain , pain pump nerve stimulators use . The nurses recovery room administer VAS assessment record time frequency pain medication dose blind patient ' Group number . The nurse provide pain medication visual analog assessment duty post-op anesthesia unit , administer drug procedure specifically research purpose . Post-operative Care All patient discharge home surgery center day ( within 2-3 hour ) postoperatively . Patients make weight bearing tolerate crutch brace . While PACU , time point 15min 1 hour , standardize previously validate visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain assessment deliver patient recovery room nurse . Patients discharge ask rate severe pain morning night 4 consecutive postoperative day use VAS pain scale . A standardized pain medication regimen give include : one two tab Percocet 7.5/325mg take every 4 6 hour need . A log time amount medication take POD keep recorded patient . Patients also instruct use cryotherapy 20 min interval 3 time per day . Patients also begin POD 0 use continuous passive motion machine start comfortable range motion progress 5 degrees/day tolerate . Patients return first post-operative visit 7-10 day diary collect patient clinically assess . Patient 's also see three month post-operative visit clinically assess presence chondrolysis ( frequently measure outcome knee pain medication injection study ) . Statistical Analysis Based previous study , Mann-Whitney U test check difference numeric variable . Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test compare analgesia level two group possible ANOVA test compare analgesia duration . Chi-square test utilized potential complication also record . Power Analysis Prelim Power Analysis per STATS department @ Cedars : sample size 26 group ( N1=N2=26 ) = Total 52 patient achieve 80 % power reject null hypothesis equal mean population mean difference 2 standard deviation group 2.5 significance level ( alpha ) 0.050 use two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test . A total 60 patient enrolled ensure investigator achieve adequate power study . Despite addition selective regional blockade anesthesia team include femoral saphenous nerve block , portion patient still experience post-operative knee pain within first hour day procedure . Pain may result femoral tunnel drill theoretically may relieve posterior capsular injection . Eliminating painful period improve patient 's subjective experience undergoing surgery , may also allow early range motion participation rehabilitation strengthen exercise perform patient peri-operative period .</detailed_description>
