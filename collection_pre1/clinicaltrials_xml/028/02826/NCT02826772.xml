	<brief_summary>This study open-label , non-randomized , dose escalation study subject metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) progress hormonal therapy ( abiraterone enzalutamide ) chemotherapy ( docetaxel ) , tolerate either therapy . There two treatment phase : Phase 1 ( dose escalation stage ) : Multiple dose escalation GT0918 ( proxalutamide ) establish safety tolerability . Phase 2 ( dose expansion stage ) : Identify two dose level Phase 1 evaluate safety , tolerability antitumor activity GT0918 ( proxalutamide ) ; subject randomize 2 treatment arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The start dose cohort dose escalation stage 50 mg GT0918 ( proxalutamide ) PO daily administer 3 subject fast state . The next dose cohort dose escalation stage 100 mg PO daily administer 6 subject fast state escalation follow dose level , total least 6 subject per cohort : 200 mg , 300 mg , 400 mg , 500 mg . Dose escalation occur minimum 3 subject 50 mg dose level complete 28 day treatment , DLTs occur safety review cohort perform . Dose escalation remain cohort occur minimum 6 subject complete 28 day treatment , either DLTs ≤1 subject DLT , safety review cohort perform . During dose escalation stage , subject take GT0918 oral administration daily empty stomach ( fasted state ) 28 consecutive day . The first dosing cycle follow least 7-day off-treatment period ( PK analysis ) ; however , off-treatment period schedule subsequent treatment cycle . If individual subject GT0918 show objective response stable disease ( SD ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1.1 ) criterion expect benefit continued treatment opinion investigator , may continue receive additional cycle GT0918 absence untoward serious toxicity ; however , subject permit start subsequent cycle bi-monthly disease evaluation confirm disease progression occur . A subject without disease progression may continue GT0918 treatment approval investigator ; treatment continue subject experience intolerable adverse event ( AE ) disease progression , withdraws consent termination study sponsor . A total 6 cycle GT0918 plan ; however , subject without progressive disease ( PD ) option continue assign dose 6-month Extension Study . At end total 6 cycle GT0918 additional extension cycle , post-treatment period 4 week commence conclude end-of-study visit . The recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) base safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic , and/or anti-tumor activity , etc . GT0918 dose escalation stage .</detailed_description>

Progressive disease define 1 follow criterion : Subjects rise PSA value &gt; 2 ng/mL least 2 measurement , least 1 week apart . If confirmatory PSA value less screen PSA value , additional test rise PSA required document progression . Subjects measurable disease , progression define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . Subjects metastatic bone disease , progression define 2 new lesion radionuclide bone scan . 7 .
