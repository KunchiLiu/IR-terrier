	<brief_title>Prediction Fluid Responsiveness Children With Single Ventricle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate predictability abdominal compression-induced change blood pressure fluid responsiveness child single ventricle ( bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt Fontan tract ) . When clinical sign hypovolemia , hypotension , decrease urine output central venous pressure le 5 mmHg , right upper abdomen gently compress 10 second . Changes blood pressure continuously record period . About 3 min later , intravenous colloid fluid 10 mL/kg infuse 20 min . To evaluate change cardiac output , transesophageal transthoracic echocardiography perform fluid administration . In addition , hemodynamic parameter include pulse pressure variation , systolic pressure variation , pleth variability index central venous pressure also record fluid administration . Finally , patient divide fluid responder group non-responder group . If cardiac output measure use echocardiography increase 15 % fluid administration , patient fluid responder . Using ROC curve , diagnostic power abdominal compression-induced blood pressure change fluid responsiveness evaluate</detailed_description>
