	<brief_summary>First , investigator image patient hyperpolarized xenon ( Xe ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) develop technique hyperpolarized xenon MRI University Virginia ( UVA ) . Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) sequence need develop optimized equipment UVA . These sequence need evaluate healthy adult comparison result obtain adult lung disease optimize sequence detection evaluation lung disease . The MR pulse sequence need optimize parameter human MR coil gas exchange characteristic healthy diseased lung . Second , investigator propose exploit power Xe129 MRI diagnostic tool monitor therapeutic response combination inhaler , Advair , contain long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist ( LABA ) inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) - two major class current COPD therapeutic . The investigator characterize functional change lung COPD baseline , investigate response lung treatment three-month trial . Also investigator compare correspond result obtain Xe129 dissolve phase ( DP ) MRI result obtain gadolinium-based dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI ( perfusion MRI ) high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) lung indirectly validate Xe129 DP MRI technique . The investigator anticipate result project greatly improve investigator understand lung functional response COPD subject current therapeutic . Also , investigator expect project provide evidence consider Xe129 MRI diagnostic strategy ass monitor therapeutic response exist new pharmaceutical , thus Xe129 MRI stimulate development novel therapy COPD future</brief_summary>
