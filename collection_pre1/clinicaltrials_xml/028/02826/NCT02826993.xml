	<brief_summary>A total 8000 colonoscopy perform yearly basis Funen Island . Between 5 % 10 % incomplete due excessive pain , fix colon loop , reason . The current standard procedure refer patient department radiology CT-colonography . In instance radiology department offer investigation next day , thus colon preparation . At time , patient go second colon preparation colonography . A CCE procedure could provide participant immediately fail colonoscopy investigation complete next morning bowel preparation without visit radiology department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical colonoscopy standard method evaluate colon . This technique allow evaluation entire colon patient . Full colonoscopy include examination cecum associate increased detection rate advance neoplasia , 33-50 % advanced neoplasia locate proximal colon . After incomplete optical colonoscopy , participant require undergo another test order exclude clinically relevant lesion reduce risk proximal cancer show increase twofold colonoscopy incomplete . Endoscopic radiological option complete colon assessment available last decade . Multiple alternative endoscopic techniques—such colonoscopy thinner colonoscope , gastroscope device-assisted enteroscopes describe . However , none clearly standardize . CT colonography ( CTC ) , relatively new image technique first described 1994 . In large randomized trial symptomatic patient , CTC show equally effective colonoscopy — detection large colorectal polyp already develop colorectal cancer . Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( CCE ) promise new technology may potential complement exist diagnostic method screen people colorectal cancer . Delivered correctly , may reduce cost , increase utilization medical service , reduce risk patient overall improve screen rate among population . A total 8000 colonoscopy perform yearly basis Funen Island 10 % incomplete due excessive pain , fix colon loop , others cause . The current standard procedure refer participant Department Radiology CT-colonography .</detailed_description>
