	<brief_summary>Periodontal disease gum infection cause plaque teeth contain bacteria calculus ( hard ) deposit . These need remove regular basis maintain gum health prevent teeth weakening . A routine cleaning procedure , scaling/root planing , accompany post-operative soft tissue tenderness teeth sensitivity make oral hygiene maintenance difficult wound heal . The need novel therapeutic approach , cyanoacrylate adhesive , identify . It hypothesize application may provide comfort assist patient daily oral self-care procedure follow teeth cleaning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Cyanoacrylate Adhesive ( PeriAcryl®90 HV ) Periodontal Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The supra-gingival marginal application cyanoacrylate adhesive promote periodontal wound heal prevent increase sensitivity hard ( teeth ) soft ( gingiva ) tissue follow non-surgical periodontal therapy ( NSPT ) . This pilot study involve small number participant , design prove causation , evaluate safety efficacy . If clinical result positive , data may use determine sample power need large study . With enhanced post-operative comfort , patient 's ability disrupt biofilm maintain optimal daily oral self-care achieve . Biofilm disruption paramount achieve periodontal health . Specifically , adjunctive placement adhesive dressing may reduce biofilm accumulation associate periodontal inflammation . This novel application could improve patient 's oral thus overall health . The present pilot trial aim explore therapeutic effectiveness cyanoacrylate adhesive ( PeriAcryl®90 HV ) reduce patient-reported outcome related discomfort sensitivity post NSPT , examine potential positive effect periodontal wound heal well record potential side-effects may experience patient .</detailed_description>
