	<brief_summary>This project prospective observational cohort study quantify risk acquire Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection patient healthcare worker Ain Shams University Teaching Hospital , Cairo , Egypt : 1 ) identify typical patient trajectory within hospital ; 2 ) assess ward-specific risk base type number procedure perform prevalence HCV viremia patient within ward .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigative Mathematical Modeling Hospital Transmission Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) blood-borne virus major route transmission include blood transfusion , medical injection procedure , inject drug use . In Egypt , origin HCV epidemic attribute mass treatment schistosomiasis 1960 1984 , intravenous injection antimony salt give 3-5 million people old 6 year age . Insufficient sterilization needle syrinx consider responsible HCV transmission time . In order control spread HCV Egypt , Egyptian Ministry Health Population establish National Committee Control Viral Hepatitis . By 2008 , committee develop National Control Strategy Viral Hepatitis recommend prevention education campaign target general population also healthcare worker ( HCW ) . In occupational environment , HCWs frequently expose multiple blood-borne pathogen , include HCV . Several risk factor HCV acquisition among patient HCWs within hospital ward identify , include high prevalence HCV infection ward , understaffing , workplace characteristic , human factor inexperience unfamiliar equipment . However , investigator ' knowledge , overall risk HCV acquisition associate hospital stay never evaluate Egypt . Also , control measure reduce risk HCV transmission hospital setting , base global assessment healthcare provider logistics performance , never propose Egypt . In project , investigator assume HCV transmit hospital staff patient . Given slow dynamic HCV epidemic , investigator hypothesize , short term , prevalence HCV viremia among patient constant . Therefore , investigator lead conclude HCV transmission risk may infer detailed description individual trajectory patient staff within hospital .</detailed_description>
