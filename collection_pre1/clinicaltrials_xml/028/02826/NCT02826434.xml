	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate Immunotherapy peptide vaccine Programmed Death Ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) inhibitor possible adjuvant treatment Stage II III Triple Negative Breast Cancer . This research study study safety , tolerability , immune response treatment . The name study intervention involve study : - PVX-410 Vaccine - Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant PVX-410 Vaccine Durvalumab Stage II/III Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase Ib clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try well understand investigational intervention affect body . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve PVX-410 Durvalumab treatment disease . - Durvalumab protein affect immune system block PD-L1 pathway . The PD-L1 pathway control body 's natural immune response , tumor interrupt pathway partially resist escape immune system . By block PD-L1 pathway , Durvalumab may help immune system identify catch tumor cell . - PVX-410 investigational vaccine develop treat multiple myeloma triple negative breast cancer . - In research study , investigator study body 's immune response PVX-410 study vaccine combination Durvalumab . This study help researcher understand vaccine Durvalumab work together help body 's immune system recognize triple negative breast cancer . The investigator also study safety PVX-410 vaccine alone together Durvalumab .</detailed_description>

For tumor equivocal interpretation receptor status ( e.g . `` weak '' `` faint '' staining , Principal Investigator final determination triple negative status . Completed planned therapy Stage II III TNBC ( American Joint Committee Cancer , 7th Edition ) meeting follow guideline : receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy residual invasive disease surgery and/or complete adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation . ( The patient may adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy disease ) . Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen must include least 4 cycle standard chemotherapy regimen , generally include one generally accept standard regimen ( include limit : Adriamycin/CytoxanTaxol , Taxotere/Cytoxan , Adriamycin/Cytoxan , Cytoxan/Methotrexate/Fluorouracil ) . For patient receive standard chemotherapy part clinical trial , regimen include least 4 cycle therapy .
