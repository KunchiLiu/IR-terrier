	<brief_summary>The study base theory `` unified airway '' considers nose paranasal sinus together low airways one integrated unit . The upper low respiratory tract function interdependent physiologic mechanism , stimuli trigger change one portion airway , provoke similar change throughout airway . This well document asthmatic patient document poorly patient suffer chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) . COPD associate sinonasal symptom decrease quality life . Although nasal involvement find directly affect low airway , sinonasal disease under-diagnosed under-treated patient COPD . This study embed large project goal gain knowledge support theory `` unified airway '' patient COPD . Here sinonasal , pulmonary generic health relate quality life study group patient COPD versus control group . The severity nasal airway obstruction link severity pulmonary airway obstruction . Assessment pathological change nose nasal endoscopy , well perform nasal cytological brushing identification nasal inflammatory response nose , conduct control study group .</brief_summary>
