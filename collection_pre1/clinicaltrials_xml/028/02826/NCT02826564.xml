	<brief_summary>The goal propose research project ass safety ( dose limit toxicity , DLT ) combination pembrolizumab high-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) patient metastatic urothelial cancer . Both SBRT dose pembrolizumab dose fix , time combination vary . Secondary objective include response rate , local control , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Exploratory endpoint include immunologic response response rate PD-L1- TIL- tumor . The combination sequence promising response rate best safety profile select continue Phase II trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . 2 . Be ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . 4 . Have prior treatment 2 week prior study day 1 , treatment naïve patient allow 5 . Histologically confirm diagnosis urothelial carcinoma 6 . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement Sponsor . 7 . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 8 . Demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . ( Adequate organ function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL , Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL , Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) , Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN , Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis , Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy ( long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard ) 9 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential ( Section 5.7.2 ) must willing use adequate method contraception outline Section 5.7.2 Contraception , course study 120 day last dose study medication . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . 11 . Male subject childbearing potential ( Section 5.7.1 ) must agree use adequate method contraception outline Section 5.7.1 Contraception , start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . The subject must exclude participate trial subject : 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has radiotherapy interfere SBRT . 3 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 4 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 5 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 6 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 7 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 8 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 9 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 10 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 11 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 12 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 13 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 14 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 15 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 16 . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . 17 . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . 18 . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . 19 . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
