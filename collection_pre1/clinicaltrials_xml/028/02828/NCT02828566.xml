	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness intranasal ( IN ) ketamine compare standard intravenous ( IV ) ketamine administration simple reduction orthopaedic injury paediatric population . The aim ass IN administration equivalent current standard care , IV . The population study child 4-17 year age require simple orthopaedic reduction . Following double dummy approach overcome difficulty mask intervention , participant receive IV IN intervention , one real drug . Procedural sedation analgesia ( PSA ) assess use Dartmouth Operative Conditions Scale ( DOCS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization concealment allocation pharmacy-controlled use computerized central randomization service . The treat physician , bedside nurse , research assistant , participant blind intervention . Eligible participant randomize 1:1 allocation ratio stratify block design four six either ( 1 ) IN ketamine ( single dose , 10 mg/kg prepare 0.9 % NS 3 mL syringe atomizer , maximum 8 mL ) PLUS IV 0.9 % NS 0.02 mL/kg ( 2 ) IV ketamine ( single dose , 1 mg/kg , maximum 80 mg ) PLUS intranasal 0.9 % NS 0.09 mL/kg divide naris . Due perceptible difference interventional route , participant receive IV IN intervention use double-dummy approach . For IN dose volume less equal 0.5 mL , entire dose deliver 1 nostril dos great 0.5 mL , dose divide equally naris . Adjunctive sedation give need form IV ketamine , dose , participant adequately sedate 1 minute IV administration discretion treat physician . Inadequate sedation context refer one following : participant 's vocalization consistent pain OR participant withdraws localize due pain . Eligible participant identify treat physician view radiograph perform clinical assessment . The physician inform research assistant ( RA ) participant eligible . The RA seek inform consent explain protocol family . Baseline demographic information obtain . Informed consent PSA pre-anesthetic assessment perform treat physician accordance usual standard care . The RA record continuous video participant 's entire body monitor use iPad start immediately IV intervention participant awake able tolerate oral fluid . DOCS score obtain two trained outcome assessor every 30 second entire duration video . The outcome assessor also score entire video emergence delirium use Paediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) scale every 5 minute begin completion fracture reduction participant awake drinking . Participants receive standard monitoring oxygen saturation , blood pressure , respiratory rate , apnea , heart rate , rash attend nurse physician every 5 minute per usual standard care . The usual standard care also include monitor post-anesthetic presence know idiosyncratic effect ketamine include vomit , seizure , headache , emergence reaction , hypersensitivity . The RA obtain information nursing record discharge base consensus-based Canadian recommendation . Immediately prior discharge , RA also record duration stay ED , parental , patient , physician satisfaction PSA use 5-item Likert scale , nasal irritation</detailed_description>
