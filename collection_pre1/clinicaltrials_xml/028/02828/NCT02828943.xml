	<brief_summary>The purpose present study determine utility effectiveness combine inspiratory ( IMT ) expiratory muscle training ( EMT ) improve ventilatory function people disable long-term stroke ( great 8 month follow onset ) hemiparesis hemiplegia . xx subject randomize 2 parallel group experimental group undergo combine IMT high-resistance EMT comparison group undergo IMT low- resistance EMT . Both train technique involve breathe tube know amount resistance . Subjects perform breathe maneuver 10 repetition , twice daily , 5 day per week 4 week , home environment . Adherence monitor reminder telephone call least weekly . Outcomes assess use maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure standard pulmonary function testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose present study determine utility effectiveness Expiratory Muscle Training improve respiratory muscle strength patient chronic stroke , combine Inspiratory Muscle Training . 20 participant recruit one site ( Rehabilitation Institute Chicago ) . All participant give write informed consent enrollment study . Participants compensated participation . Participants participate study one month . Maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure measure seated position . Pulmonary function test also perform seat position use spirometer . Dyspnea assess Medical Research Council ( MRC ) dyspnea scale . The initial evaluation consist record demographic information conduct comprehensive medical history , include : age , gender , race , marital status , education , employment , smoke history , ischemic stroke etiology , stroke severity NIH Stroke Scale , stroke location . This information may also obtain RIC electronic medical record . Each subject undergo thorough neurologic assessment . Study participant randomly assign one two group : experimental group high resistance EMT control group low resistance EMT . The participant randomize two group independent staff member time enrollment base medical record number . Both group undergo IMT IMT find effective improving MIP well FEV1 FVC . The patient read pulmonary function test blind group assignment participant . Upon enrollment study , respiratory muscle training complete twice daily 5 day week 4 week . Training provide Threshold IMT ( Respironics , Murrysville , PA ) inspiratory train Threshold PEP ( Respironics , Murrysville , PA ) expiratory training . The Threshold respiratory trainer commercially available device spring-loaded valve provide resistance . The pressure load adjust 2 cm H2O interval Threshold IMT , 41 cm H2O , 1 cm H2O interval Threshold PEP , 20 cm H2O . EMT train load experimental group set 30 % maximal expiratory pressure control group EMT set 5 cm H2O , low set device . IMT train load set 30 % maximal inspiratory pressure group . The patient blind valve titration . Each training session include one set 10 repetition IMT follow one set 10 repetition high resistance EMT low resistance EMT . Patients instruct maintain respiratory rate 15-20 breaths/min without rest repetition . Participants monitor daily phone self-reported log completion training . At two week , participant follow-up office visit monitor progress complete 80 % training session increase train 40 % maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure tolerate . Each participant undergo baseline measurement maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure baseline pulmonary function test well 4 week training . Three trial perform high result three trial record .</detailed_description>
