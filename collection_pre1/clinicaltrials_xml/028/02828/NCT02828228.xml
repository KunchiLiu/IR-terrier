This group include 2 798 ( 16.32 % ) child , among 9.17 % 6-years age , 19.30 % 10-years 20.48 % 14-years ) . All child qualify intervention education program . A total 1 627 child qualified basis screen eventually take part first edition program . A total 4 meeting participate child caregiver schedule 12-month-long education intervention program : enrollment , 3 , 6 12 month thereafter . The meeting form individual consultation various specialist .

After consult specialist involve program , individual protocol health intervention develop every child . The objective intervention include modification diet , increase health activity level strengthen health-seeking behavior child 's family member .

Participation program reflect significant decrease BMI percentile ( p=0.0001 ) , well significant drop fat mass content measure bioelectrical impedance , 39.0 % 31.4 % ( p=0.0001 ) . On basis finding , municipality Gdansk decide support program 2014-2016 . The experiment follow pattern double blind randomize study . The enrolled subject randomly assign one two group : Group 1 - weight-loss program 52 week + vitamin D 1200 ( IU ) daily 26 week Group 2 - weight-loss program 52 week +placebo daily 26 week Visit I : enrollment : - medical history , physical examination - interpretation laboratory finding ( test conduct screen + concentration vitamin D ) , - anthropometric evaluation analysis body composition ( bioimpedance method ) - consultation dietician , psychologist specialist physical activity , define detail protocol intervention - Kasch Pulse Recovery Test - determination hs-C-reactive protein , Interleukin 6 , chemerin adiponectin concentration blood sample obtain screen - inform parent objective protocol study - obtain write informed consent participation study - randomization GROUP I II - densitometry ( DXA ) - within one week enrollment Visit II : 13 week : - medical history , physical examination - anthropometric evaluation analysis body composition ( bioimpedance method ) - consultation dietician , psychologist specialist physical activity , define detail protocol intervention Within week prior Visit III - obtain blood ( ca . 5 ml ) laboratory test ( complete blood count , lipid profile , hs-C-reactive protein , oral glucose tolerance test , insulin , Interleukin 6 , adiponectin chemerin concentration Visit III : 26 week : - medical history , physical examination - interpretation laboratory finding - anthropometric evaluation analysis body composition ( bioimpedance method ) - consultation dietician , psychologist specialist physical activity , define detail protocol intervention - obtain blood laboratory test - termination active compound/placebo administration Visit IV : 52 week : - medical history , physical examination - anthropometric evaluation analysis body composition ( bioimpedance method ) - consultation dietician , psychologist specialist physical activity , define detail protocol intervention - densitometry ( DXA ) - within one week terminating study</detailed_description>
