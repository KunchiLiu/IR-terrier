	<detailed_description>Patients skull defect craniotomy example tumor resection , head trauma , stroke , need reimplantation bone afterwards . For circumstance , bone reimplanted due infection , tumor infiltration , damage bone , aseptic bone necrosis . In case Patient Specific Implant ( PSI ) need design fit patient ` skull defect . Several material currently use titanium , poly-ether-ether-ketone ( PEEK ) poly-methylmethyl-acrylate ( PMMA ) PSI fabrication . At moment , PSI commercially available different company ( DePuy Synthes® , EOS® , Xilloc® ) . Apart high cost commercially available PSI , take usually several week design manufacture PSI deliver hospital ready reimplantation . On hand , method software-based PSI design intraoperative fabrication PSI sterile condition describe Stieglitz et al . This method currently use everyday clinic department neurosurgery Bern . In short summary , design PSI base preoperative CT-scan patient ` head skull defect , image data set upload processed IPlanNet software BrainLab® . With help software , 3D model negative mould PSI design print . In operation room , PSI fabricate sterile condition use PSI mould . The design PSI mould help IPlanNet demand take hour depend complexity case design . In certain case accuracy fabricate PSI mould optimal , surgeon intraoperatively adapt inaccuracy achieve best cosmetic functional result expense operation duration , know risk factor postoperative wound infection perioperative complication . Therefore , investigator develop automate computer-based algorithm PSI design ( CAPSID ) . With help tool , accurate PSI corresponding mould calculate design base preoperative CT scan patient within 5-15 minute correspond mould print . This step automate thus , independent neurosurgeon experience skills 3D processing software . The mould use intraoperative fabrication implant sterile condition common way describe . The possible advantage clinical establishment procedure would higher accuracy PSI compare conventional PSI fabrication method well cosmetic result , low cost faster availability production lead short wait time patient , consequence high accuracy lead short operation time , reduction risk operative adverse event patient . Furthermore , proof practicability new method , could lead new concept field Computer-based Patient Specific Implants modern medicine general . A clinical trial necessary proof advantage practicability investigator ' concept computer-based algorithm PSI design ( CAPSID ) patient skull defect .</detailed_description>
