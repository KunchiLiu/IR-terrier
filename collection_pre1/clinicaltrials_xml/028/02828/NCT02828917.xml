	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate MedJ-01 safety efficacy de novo restenosis lesion target vessel diameter 2.5mm 4.25 , subject undergo coronary artery stent implantation . The target population subject undergoing PCI angina ( stable unstable ) , silent ischemia ( absence symptom visually estimate target lesion diameter stenosis ≥70 % , positive non-invasive stress test , FFR ≤0.80 must present ) , NSTEMI , recent subacute STEMI ( &gt; 72 hour initial presentation stable ) . Complex lesion allow . A maximum two target vessel two lesion per vessel may treat ( two lesion separate 10 mm cover single stent consider one lesion ) ; total plan study stenting coronary tree exceed 100 mm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient indication PCI include angina ( stable/unstable ) , silent ischemia ( absence symptom visually estimate target lesion diameter stenosis ≥70 % , positive noninvasive stress test , FFR ≤0.80 must present ) , NSTEMI , recent subacute STEMI . For subacute STEMI time presentation first treat hospital , whether transfer facility study hospital , must &gt; 72 hour prior enrollment enzyme level ( CKMB Troponin ) demonstrate either enzyme level peak . 2 . Nontarget vessel PCI allow prior enrollment depend time interval condition follow : During Baseline Procedure : PCI nontarget vessel perform baseline procedure immediately prior enrollment successful uncomplicated define : &lt; 50 % visually estimate residual diameter stenosis , TIMI Grade 3 flow , dissection ≥ NHLBI type C , perforation , persistent ST segment change , prolong chest pain , TIMI major BARC type 3 bleeding . Less 24 hour prior Baseline Procedure : Not allow ( see exclusion criterion # 2 ) . 24 hours30 day prior Baseline Procedure : PCI nontarget vessel 24 hour 30 day prior enrollment successful uncomplicated define . In addition , case nontarget vessel PCI occur 2472 hour prior baseline procedure , least 2 set cardiac biomarkers must draw least 6 12 hour nontarget vessel PCI . If cardiac biomarkers initially elevate local laboratory upper limit normal , serial measurement must demonstrate biomarkers fall . Over 30 day prior Baseline Procedure : PCI nontarget vessel perform great 30 day prior procedure whether successful uncomplicated . 3 . Patient willing able provide inform write consent comply followup visit test schedule . Angiographic inclusion criterion ( visual estimate ) : 4 . Target lesion ( ) must locate native coronary artery visually estimate diameter ≥2.5 mm ≤4.25 mm . 5 . Complex lesion allow include calcified lesion ( lesion preparation scoring/cutting rotational atherectomy allow ) , presence thrombus nonocclusive require thrombectomy , CTO , bifurcationlesions ( except plan dual stent implantation ) , ostial RCA lesion , tortuous lesion , bare metal stent restenotic lesion , protect leave main lesion . 6 . Overlapping stent allow investigational device ( MedJ01 ) . 1 . STEMI within 72 hour ( subacute ) initial time presentation first treat hospital , whether transfer facility study hospital enzyme level ( either CKMB Troponin ) peak . 2 . PCI within 24 hour precede baseline procedure . 3 . Nontarget lesion PCI target vessel within 12 month baseline procedure . 4 . History stent thrombosis . 5 . Cardiogenic shock ( defined persistent hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm/Hg 30 minute ) require pressor hemodynamic support , include IABP . 6 . Subject intubate . 7 . Known LVEF &lt; 30 % . 8 . Relative absolute contraindication DAPT 12 month ( include plan surgery delay ) 9 . Subject indication chronic oral anticoagulant treatment ( either vitamin K antagonists novel anticoagulant NOACs ) 10 . Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation . 11 . Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL . 12 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 . 13 . White blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3 . 14 . Clinically significant liver disease . 15 . Active peptic ulcer active bleeding site . 16 . Bleeding site within prior 8 week require active medical surgical attention . 17 . If femoral access plan , significant peripheral arterial disease precludes safe insertion 6F sheath . 18 . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy refuse blood transfusion . 19 . Cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month , permanent neurologic defect attribute CVA . 20 . Known allergy study stent component e.g . cobalt , nickel , chromium , Carbosil® , PBMA , limus drug ( ridaforolimus , zotarolimus , tacrolimus , sirolimus , everolimus , similar drug analogue derivative similar compound ) . 21 . Known allergy protocolrequired concomitant medication aspirin , DAPT ( Drugs inhibit P2Y12 clopidogrel prasugrel ) , heparin , iodinated contrast adequately premedicated . 22 . Any comorbid condition may cause noncompliance protocol ( e.g . dementia , substance abuse , etc . ) reduce life expectancy &lt; 24 month ( e.g . cancer , severe heart failure , severe lung disease ) . 23 . Patient participate investigational drug device clinical trial reach primary endpoint , plan participate clinical trial . 24 . Women pregnant breastfeeding ( woman childbearing potential , defined female childbearing potential undergone permanent contraceptive operation postmenopausal , must negative pregnancy test within one week treatment . Permanent contraceptive operation define : hysterectomy , hysterosalpingectomy , bilateral oophorectomy . The status female consider postmenopausal period 12 consecutive month without alternative medical cause ) . 25 . Women intend become pregnant within 12 month baseline procedure ( woman childbearing potential sexually active must agree use reliable method contraception time screen 12 month baseline procedure ) . 26 . Patient receive organ transplant wait list organ transplant . 27 . Patient receive schedule receive chemotherapy within 30 day time baseline procedure . 28 . Patient receive oral intravenous immunosuppressive therapy know lifelimiting immunosuppressive autoimmune disease ( e.g. , HIV ) . Corticosteroids allow . Angiographic Exclusion Criteria ( visual estimate ) : 29 . Target lesion two ( 2 ) major coronary artery ( i.e. , two LAD , LCX , RCA ) respective branch ( Ramus Intermedius define branch LCX ) . 30 . More two target lesion per target vessel plan ( two lesion separate less 10 mm cover single stent consider one lesion ) . 31 . More 100 mm length plan study stenting entire coronary tree . 32 . Occlusive thrombus and/or thrombus require thrombectomy target vessel . 33 . Unprotected leave main lesion ≥30 % , plan unprotected leave main intervention . 34 . Ostial LAD LCX lesion ( stenting diseased segment within 5 mm unprotected leave main coronary artery ) . 35 . Bifurcation lesion plan dual stent implantation . 36 . Stenting lesion due DES restenosis . 37 . Another lesion target nontarget vessel ( include side branch ) present require high probability require PCI within 12 month baseline procedure . 38 .
