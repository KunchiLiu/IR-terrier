	<brief_summary>Chronic intestinal inflammation characterize inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , consist mainly Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . The exact etiology unknown disease therapeutic attempt aim down-regulating intestinal inflammation use mediator-specific nonspecific immune suppression . These attempt cause considerable side effect . Also , IBD patient different genetic background pathology . It previously show product base marijuana ( Cannabis sativa ) produce beneficial effect patient IBD , medical cannabis-based product formerly proven anti-inflammatory activity laboratory experiment clinical test . However , unknown C. sativa-based medical product exert effect IBD additional research development do . One issue resolve process medicalization C. sativa base difference patient response different C. sativa line , order fine-tune C. sativa -based treatment IBD patient . For aim fine-tuning C. sativa -based treatment IBD patient , characterized chemical composition different C. sativa line anti-inflammatory activity colon cell line . Extracts C. sativa line prepare use various method cannabinoids terpenoids profile determine chemical analysis . We find different compound different effect inflame colon cell line , lead change interleukin secretion , inflammation marker gene expression treat colon cell . In addition , develop unique system relevant personalized medicine IBD . This system allow patient-specific determination effect C. sativa -based treatment . Following , clinical test conduct aim develop cannabis-based product different C. sativa line , anti-inflammatory activity effective optimize different IBD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title project : Efficacy cannabinoids treatment inflammatory bowel disease Question investigate : The marijuana plant , Cannabis sativa use medicinal treatment variety disease . Cannabinoids report alleviate neurological condition include MS-related symptom spasticity , pain , tremor bladder dysfunction . Other neurological condition , chronic intractable pain , dystonic movement disorder , Tourette 's Syndrome also report alleviated cannabis use . Cannabis use treat anorexia AIDS cancer patient . In gastroenterology , cannabis use treat anorexia , emesis , abdominal pain , gastroenteritis , diarrhea , intestinal inflammation , diabetic gastroparesis . The cannabis plant contain 60 different compound collectively refer cannabinoids . Of , two compound delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) Cannabidiol ( CBD ) seem active . Cannabinoids profound anti-inflammatory effect , mainly CB2 receptor . Cell mediate immunity find impaired chronic marijuana user . A potent anti-inflammatory effect cannabis observe rodent . Studying functional role endocannabinoid system immune modulation reveals involve almost major immune event . Cannabinoids shift balance pro-inflammatory cytokine anti-inflammatory cytokine towards T-helper cell type 2 profile ( Th2 phenotype ) suppress cell-mediated immunity , whereas humoral immunity may enhance . Cannabidiol show reduce inflammation mouse model rheumatoid arthritis type I diabetes mellitus . Therefore , cannabinoids use treat various inflammatory condition include rheumatoid arthritis asthma . In gut , Endocannabinoids produce serosal mucosal component human intestine , study cell line show human intestinal epithelial cell produce endocannabinoids ; additional source endocannabinoids gut include human endothelial cell , platelet , resident macrophage immune cell lymphocyte . CB1 CB2 receptor upregulated experimental model inflammatory bowel disease . In mouse model colitis , cannabinoids find ameliorate inflammation , human intestine , level Anandamide increase inflammation . The inflamed small intestine also significantly elevate activity FAAH well expression CB1 cannabinoid receptor . The exact cellular target implicate reduction inflammation cannabinoids unknown . In model bronchopulmonary inflammation mouse administration anandamide decreased TNF alpha level bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) inhibit synthesis IL-12 , IL-2 , IL-6 , INF gamma , T cell proliferation . Many patient IBD report smoke marihuana ameliorate symptom , clinical study investigate observation . We recently publish first report observation use medical cannabis Crohn 's disease . In study , 30 patient , 21 improve significantly treatment cannabis . The average Harvey Bradshaw index improve 14 ± 6.7 7 ± 4.7 ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . Number bowel movement reduce average eight day five day need medication , particularly steroid , significantly reduce . In view result conduct double blind placebo control trial 20 active Crohn 's disease patient . Patients Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) &gt; 200 respond steroid , immunosuppressant anti-TNF randomize receive 2 cigarette cannabis placebo daily . Each cigarette contain 0.5 g cannabis , correspond 11.5mg Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) . The placebo contain cannabis leaf THC extract . During treatment CDAI change cannabis group 358 ± 99 139±111 ( p &lt; 0.05 ) placebo group 373 ± 94 306±143 ( p=Non significant ) . Five patient cannabis group one placebo group go complete remission ( CDAI &lt; 100 ) . Three steroid dependent patient cannabis group stop steroid study . Patients report improved appetite sleep , serious side effect . These preliminary data indicate cannabinoids great potential treatment Crohn 's disease , investigation influence , mode action , active non active cannabinoids alternative rout application clearly need . Most important question whether improvement observe cannabis consumption symptomatic whether real improvement inflammation . The aim propose study evaluate inflammation cytokine level explants colonic tissue IBD patient without cannabidiol . Materials method : Study population : Patients either Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis schedule colonoscopy deem necessary physician eligible study . After obtain informed consent , biopsy inflame normal tissue take processed tissue culture medium describe . There 6 biopsy site . Methods : Explants culture group three villus surface microporous membrane ( 0.45-_m pore size ) contain Millicell-HA tissue culture insert ( Millipore ) . The insert place inside 6-well plastic tissue culture dish ( Costar 3506 ) along 1.5 ml tissue culture medium . Tissue culture medium Dulbecco 's modify Eagle 's medium supplement 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , penicillin ( 100units/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 μg/ml ) , leupeptin ( 50 μg/ml ) , PMSF ( 1 mM ) , soybean trypsin inhibitor ( 50 μg/ml ) , dexamethasone ( 200 μg/ml ) . Cultures incubate 37°C incubator gas hourly with95 % oxygen 5 % carbon dioxide . Six biopsies site obtain . Three biopsy serve control three culture addition Cannabidiol ( 1 μg/ml ) . After 24 hour tissue viability assess addition Alamar one 3 sample . Change color purple pink indicate viable tissue . The supernatant 4 biopsy collect frozen -20°C . The biopsy place formalin pathology inspection . The supernatant control cannabis treat sample analyze presence level TNF alpha , Interferon gamma , IL-23 , IL-12 , IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-17 IL-6 .</detailed_description>
