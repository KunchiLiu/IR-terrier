	<brief_summary>The main objective study identify functional structural MRI brain area activate various pruritic situation deduct model describe different cause pruritus . The investigator go compare two chronic pruritus condition ( histaminergic urticaria non histaminergic : psoriasis ) healthy control group . The secondary objective study specify classification index physiological result obtain brain imaging differentiate multiple type pruritus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central Mechanisms Chronic Pruritus : Functional Structural Brain Imaging .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Particularly invalidating case , pruritus define unpleasant sensation cause need scratch . Epidemiologically , common disorder third population feel give week . Treatment difficult , especially pathophysiological mechanism remain poorly understood , particularly central nervous system . Specific pathway , least selective pruritus transmission identify . From skin brain , two way exist : histaminergic pathway ( classical ) , non-histaminergic pathway ( related activation PAR-2 receptor serine protease ) . If urticaria belongs first track , respective share channel unknown cause pruritus . The pruriceptors , locate skin , transmit information specific fiber spinal cord , project lateral spinothalamic tract thalamus . Then midbrain cortex , vast network involve sensorial area , motor emotional area identify functional neuroimaging , activation zone may different depend two channel ( overlap zone ) . The contribution perception pruritus brain region focus current research . A promising non-invasive method study pruritus channel neuroimaging use phenomenon `` contagious pruritus ' : seeing people scratch , itch sometimes scratch induced observer , activate brain network similar activate pruritus usually . This phenomenon even important subject atopic dermatitis healthy subject . In project , investigator plan characterize pruritus central pathway patient different type chronic pruritus compare healthy subject , particularly regard respective contribution histaminergic pathway ( pathway involve pruritus hive ) `` PAR-2-ergic '' ( pathway involve itch psoriasis ) .</detailed_description>
