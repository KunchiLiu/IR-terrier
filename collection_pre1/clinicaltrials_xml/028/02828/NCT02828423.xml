	<brief_summary>Background : The use Enamel Matrix Derivative ( EMD ) deal non-contained defect may limit , EMD maintain space . It propose use combine therapy , use bone graft combination EMD avoid collapse flap bony defect healing time . Therefore aim study evaluate clinical radiological heal response non-contained infrabony defect follow treatment combination EMD Biphasic calcium phosphate ( BC ) EMD alone . Methods : Fifty-two patient least 1 infrabony defect &gt; 3mm depth probe pocket depth ≥ 6mm randomly treat EMD/BC EMD alone . Clinical radiographic parameter evaluate baseline , 6 12 month surgery . To standardize procedure acrylic stent millimetre radiographic grid use . The primary outcome change clinical attachment level ( CAL ) . Results : Analysis data demonstrate statistically significant difference baseline within group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , show difference clinical radiographic parameter 6 12 month EMD/BC EMD alone . However , statistically significant difference treatment group . Conclusions : It conclude treatment non-contained infrabony defect EMD , without BC , result statistically significant good result 12 month compare baseline measurement . In contrast , combine approach result statistically significant improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regenerative Combined Therapy With Enamel Matrix Derivative Biphasic Calcium Phosphate Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize double blind clinical control trial ( RCT ) . Fifty-two systemically healthy adult patient ( 19 female 33 male ) range age 35 70 year age , moderate advance chronic periodontitis least 1 infrabony defect &gt; 3mm depth include . Patients recruit treated Department Periodontology dental clinic Universitat Internacional de Catalunya , Barcelona , Spain . The sample size calculation base previous pilot study 10 patient difference group set 1mm CAL gain primary outcome , alpha error 0.05 beta error 0.9 . Thus , sample size establish 52 patient include dropout . The Ethics Committee International University Catalonia ( UIC ) approve study design code PER-ECL-2011-04-CM . This RCT register follow CONSORT guideline well Helsinki declaration human research . Prior initiation study , inform consent obtain patient explain nature investigation . Treatment procedure : Initial periodontal therapy consist oral hygiene instruction patient achieve high standard oral hygiene ( modify O'Leary plaque score &lt; 20 % ) , scale root plan local anesthesia occlusal adjustment necessary . Four week completion phase I therapy , re-evaluation perform confirm inclusion subject clinical research . Probing pocket depth , attachment level , mobility , bleed probe plaque index assess . Teeth mobility great class I ( Miller 1950 ) splint adjacent teeth twist wire light-cured resin . Before proceed surgical treatment , cast model obtain alginate impression fabricate acrylic resin occlusal standardize clinical measurement periodontal probe ( Hui-fredy CP-8 ) . The occlusal stent fabricate use technique describe Lekovic . Photographs standardize reproducible intraoral digital radiograph obtain operate site . The film holder modify place registration material ( Optosil® ) bite block index dentition . A parallel cone technique ( 7mA-60kV/20ms ) use . A radiopaque millimeter grid position radiograph ass radiographic measurement . Both occlusal stent radiographic bite block millimeter grid provide well-defined reproducible measurement defect examination time point Clinical Radiographic parameter : - Clinical measurement : Two experience examiner ( AP , JN ) , involved surgical procedure , assess clinical examination . A calibration exercise perform obtain intra- inter-examiner reproducibility . According Polson et al . train program follow reproducibility 90 % achieve . The following clinical measurement take day surgery ( baseline ) 6 12 month follow-up : 1 ) Plaque index ( PI ) ; 2 ) Gingival index ( GI ) ; 3 ) Bleeding probe ( BOP ) ; 4 ) Probing pocket depth ( PPD ) ; 5 ) Gingival recession ( GR ) ; 6 ) Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) 7 ) Mobility ( M ) . PPD , GR CAL record deep site per tooth : use periodontal probe ( Hu-friedy CP-8 ) customize stent guide groove . - Radiographic measurement : The infrabony component record millimetre . The following measurement make : 1 ) distance cemento-enamel junction bottom defect ( CEJ-BD ) , 2 ) distance CEJ coronal extension alveolar bone crest ( CEJ-BC ) . The infrabony component ( INFRA ) defect define ( CEJ-BD ) - ( CEJ-BC ) , 3 ) angulation defect , assess measure angle intersection line across long axis tooth delimitation wall defect ( GeoGebra® 5.022.0-3D ) , 4 ) number remain wall defect , confirm intrasurgically . Surgical procedure Randomization perform prior surgical therapy distribution system seal card . One experienced periodontist ( AS ) perform surgical procedure instrument 2nd 3rd year periodontal resident ( RG , ML ) . Two different approach treatment infrabony defect compare randomize control double blind clinical trial . Neither examiner patient aware type procedure perform . Both surgical procedure perform local anaesthesia surgical access bony defect perform . An envelope full thickness mucoperiosteal flap raise buccal lingually follow simplify papilla preservation incision . All granulation tissue remove defect root thoroughly scale plan use hand ultrasonic instrument . The test group treat fill infrabony defect EMD/BC control group EMD alone . Previously , root surface adjacent defect treat PrefGel® ( 24 % EDTA gel ) 2 minute accord manufacture 's instruction . The root subsequently rinse saline bleeding control use gauze . Topical application EMD root surface apical-coronal direction perform study group . In test group , defect fill addition mixture remain EMD syringe BC . For treatment , mucoperiosteal flap re-positioned suture non-absorbable suture ( Monofilament 6/0 ) horizontal mattress suture simple suture technique . Postoperative Care All subject instruct rinse twice daily 2 week 0,12 % clorhexidine gluconate . Tooth brush interproximal toothbrush regenerate area initiate 15th day surgical treatment . An analgesic anti-inflammatory medication provide postoperative pain control 3 day . Antibiotic provide well 7 day . The suture remove 2 week , surgical site gently cleanse sterile saline use cotton swab . The patient schedule recall visit 1st 2nd week surgical treatment 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month postoperatively . Oral hygiene evaluate supragingival prophylaxis carry recall visit . Neither probe subgingival instrumentation perform first 6 month surgery .</detailed_description>
