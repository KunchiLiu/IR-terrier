	<brief_summary>The direct objective study determine whether experienced provider adequately and/or easily ventilate anesthetized patient NuMask device compare traditional bag-valve-mask ventilation . The researcher believe mean tidal volume obtain experienced provider manually ventilate anesthetize patient NuMask device large use traditional bag-valve-mask .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NuMask Versus Traditional Mask Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher identify potential patient study preoperative nurse screen one clinic John A. Moran Eye Center , University Utah Surgical Center Huntsman Center . These patient identify acceptability ascertain BMI , facial hair status dental status . Once identify possible candidate , patient evaluate suitability researcher . If criterion meet patient consent study . The signature consent document obtain consent take day surgery . This prospective , randomize , crossover study . At time pre-operative assessment , difficulty ventilate patient predict base presence beard , BMI &gt; 35 , history snoring/OSA , age great 55 , and/or edentulous state easy , moderate , difficult . After induction anesthesia , device use ventilate enrol patient . After induction anesthesia , tracheal intubation occur approximately 2-3 minute . A computer-generated randomization schedule determine device use first provider 's first encounter , opposite order employ provider 's second encounter . Randomization occur within stratum list . Opaque , seal envelope prepare open prior ventilation patient . The experienced provider hold device position ventilator anesthesia machine use ventilate patient . For patient safety avoidance gastric insufflation increase risk aspiration , inspiratory pressure ventilation limit 20 cm H2O use pressure control option ventilator anesthesia machine . An NM3 respiratory profile monitor ( Philips Medical , Carlsbad , CA ) use measure mean expire tidal volume peak airway pressure 10 consecutive breath device . Hemodynamic monitoring include blood pressure , heart rate , telemetry well pulse oximetry monitor time patient safety , collect study data . Presence ventilation clinically assess chest rise fall , presence end tidal CO2 , addition measure oxygen saturation level remain 90 % . If , point study ventilation become inadequate ( i.e . loss chest rise , loss end tidal CO2 , oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % ) , attend anesthesiologist take control airway regain adequate ventilation resident involve . At conclusion encounter experience provider ask grade difficulty ease ventilation device use visual analogue scale range 1 5 , immediately record . Once patient enrol study study complete , researcher begin data analysis help statistician . Once researcher satisfy adequacy data , study close .</detailed_description>
