	<brief_summary>This single center , prospective study calculate cerebrospinal fluid pressure ( CSFp ) use non-invasive device ass role development optic neuropathy due glaucoma idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) . The study also aim ass whether CSFp differs untreated treated patient glaucoma , ocular hypertension , IIH , ocular disease may associate CSFp difference .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Translaminar Pressure Gradient Using Noninvasive Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) remain unclear , potentially multifactorial etiology . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) know modifiable risk factor , yet two clinical conundrum remain - patient elevate IOP develop glaucoma ( ocular hypertension , OHTN ) well patient IOP &lt; 21 mmHg still develop glaucoma ( normal tension glaucoma , NTG ) . The etiology two scenario remain unclear . The role cerebrospinal fluid pressure ( CSFp ) glaucomatous optic neuropathy initially raise 30-40 year ago . This concept garner interest recently due new finding area . Patients underwent lumbar puncture ( LP ) POAG find low CSFp compare control chart review . Further study demonstrate positive correlation optic nerve damage translaminar pressure gradient ( TPG ) , calculate CSFp subtract IOP . In 2010 , Chinese group suggest normal-tension glaucoma ( NTG ) patient significantly low CSFp compare POAG , TPG great NTG POAG patient compare control . The group also show OHTN patient higher CSFp POAG patient , suggest protective effect high CSFp IOP elevate . Thus , role CSFp pathophysiology glaucoma may exist . One consider IIH model form glaucoma ; CSFp elevate IIH , measure lumbar puncture ( LP ) . Visual field loss disease follow arcuate pattern , similar glaucomatous loss . This would seem suggest glaucomatous optic neuropathy IIH optic neuropathy share similar mechanism ( i.e. , increased TPG due either elevate IOP CSFp ) . One main hindrance test hypothesis invasive nature LP , involve insert large-bore needle spinal column . This procedure relatively high risk complication give proximity spinal cord potential traumatic nervous system injury improperly perform . In contrast invasive procedure , non-invasive computational device recently develop CE mark approve measure CSFp use two-depth transcranial Doppler device ( TDTCD ) . The underlying principle device involve ophthalmic artery . When originate internal carotid artery , ophthalmic artery within subarachnoid space thus mildly compressed CSFp . After exit intracranial space orbit , ophthalmic artery lose subarachnoid surrounding , longer affect CSFp . The TDTCD applies minimal external pressure orbit pressure exert externally extracranial segment equivalent CSFp exert intracranial segment ( measure Doppler signal vessel . ) The safety device demonstrate verified ; obtain CE certification Europe , currently await FDA approval `` Non-Significant Risk '' categorization . Further detail regard device view www.vittamed.com . The device show correlate extremely well gold standard LP . Multiple clinical trial utilize device noninvasive CSFp monitoring neurosurgical patient underway various institution , include Johns Hopkins University , NASA , Baylor College Medicine . The investigator propose utilizing TDTCD non-invasively measure CSFp glaucoma/OHTN patient , IIH patient , control various stage treatment order delineate possible role TPG pathophysiology condition . The investigator believe non-invasive approach potential alter current understanding management disease process , thereby assist identification at-risk patient accurately , improve patient ' quality life .</detailed_description>
