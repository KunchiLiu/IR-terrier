	<brief_summary>The objective study include use new technology SS-OCT ( swept source optical coherence tomography ) evaluate morphological abnormality vitreous , retina choroid ass repeatability retinal choroidal thickness measurement retinal disease use SS-OCT. A secondary objective use new image modality adaptive optic directly visualize photoreceptor mosaic microvasculature eye retinal choroidal disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced OCT Adaptive Optics Imaging Retinal Disease ( The ACAD Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diseases affect vitreous , retina choroid among common cause sight-loss vision impairment England Wales . These disease may display wide range pathological feature include vitreous , retinal subretinal haemorrhage ; macular fluid ; choroidal inflammation choroidal mass . The retina 'window brain ' increase evidence neurodegenerative disorder Multiple Sclerosis , Parkinsons Disease Alzheimers Disease retinal manifestation may prognostic implication , afford earlier diagnosis , potentially act surrogate endpoint treatment trial . In 2012 , advance OCT technology bring market arrival first commercial available swept-source OCT ( SS-OCT ) device ( Topcon DRI OCT ) . SS-OCT technology use tuneable laser light source longer wavelength light ( typically 1040-1050 nm central wavelength ) light source see conventional SD-OCT device . This lead great tissue penetration less backscatter RPE , produce image choroid great resolution fast image acquisition speed ( 100,000 A scans/s ) long line scan length . The ability take rapid scan commercially available SS-OCT device ( DRI , Tocon Inc. Paramus , NY , USA ) also enhance image quality line scan averaging capability . The high axial resolution OCT allow discrimination distinct retinal layer affect differentially different disease . More direct visualisation photoreceptor layer afford use Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope ( AOSLO ) , provide excellent lateral resolution allow direct visualisation cone rod photoreceptor mosaic vivo correct ocular aberration result lateral comparable histopathological section . In study AO image correlate SD- SS-OCT use comprehensively assess integrity photoreceptor mosaic . Furthermore AO OCT use measure nerve fibre layer loss optic disc change relevant disease . The imaging modality use study spectral domain optical coherence topography ( SD-OCT ) , sweep source optical coherence tomography ( SS-OCT ) , adaptive optic scan light ophthalmoscope ( AOSLO ) The study examine 300 patient ( 600 eye ) single visit Adaptive Optics ( AO ) image take subset patient ( 200 ) . Patients AO image possible technical perspective invite back image 6-12 month ( standard NHS follow visit ) probe longitudinal change . An examiner scan participant study eye ( ) day 3 image modality SD-OCT , SS-OCT AOSLO . Finally questionnaire use explore whether participant prefer one OCT image modality ( SS-OCT v SD-OCT ) .</detailed_description>
