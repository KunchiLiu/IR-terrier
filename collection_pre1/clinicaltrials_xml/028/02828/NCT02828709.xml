	<brief_summary>Irreversible Electroporation ( IRE ) emerge technique deliver electrical pulse ablate tissue , theoretical advantage overcome main shortcoming conventional thermal ablation . Recent short-term research show IRE ablation renal mass safe feasible treatment option . In ablate resect design , histopathological analysis 4 week radical nephrectomy demonstrated IRE target renal tumor completely cover ablation zone . In order develop validate long-term IRE follow-up study , essential obtain clinical confirmation efficacy novel technology . Additionally , follow-up IRE ablation oblige verification suitable imaging modality . The objective study clinical efficacy safety IRE ablation renal mass evaluate use cross-sectional imaging modality follow-up IRE renal tumour . This prospective , human , in-vivo study among 20 patient present solid enhance SRM cross sectional imaging suspect renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Preoperatively , image require Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography ( CT ) . Furthermore , serum creatinine level VAS score obtain . A biopsy SRM perform preoperative setting . IRE ablation perform use CT-guidance ablation success measure directly ablation contrast-enhanced CT. Device relate adverse event ( AE ) register use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 guideline . One week post ablation CEUS MRI perform limit exposure ionize radiation . At 3 month , 6 month 12 month post ablation CEUS , MRI CT perform . Additionally , time point serum creatinine level VAS score obtain , quality life assess SF-36 questionnaire . Residual recurrent disease assess tissue enhancement cross sectional imaging .</brief_summary>
