	<detailed_description>This double-blind , dose escalating , randomize , vehicle-controlled study design compare efficacy safety patidegib gel 2 % 4 % applied twice daily comparison vehicle . Approximately 36 subject meet study entry criterion enrol one four sequential cohort . As soon one cohort completely enrol , next cohort enrol . Each subject treat two previously untreated biopsy confirm treatment-targeted nodular BCCs . If subject additional non-treatment target BCCs treat surgically prior trial . Within cohort subject randomize 2:1 ratio receive active vehicle gel . The sequential cohort : - Cohort 1 : patidegib gel 2 % vehicle , daily - Cohort 2 : patidegib gel 4 % vehicle , daily - Cohort 3 : patidegib gel 2 % vehicle , twice daily - Cohort 4 : patidegib gel 4 % vehicle , twice daily The study drug apply topically treatment-targeted BCCs rim adjacent skin 12 week . Information report observed adverse event ( AEs ) obtain visit . An abbreviated physical examination ( PE ) perform Baseline Week 12 . The treatment-targeted BCCs identify Investigator Baseline visit circle ink Baseline , Weeks 6 12 photographed , measure study visit ( Baseline , Weeks 2 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 ) . Blood sample complete blood count serum chemistry urine urinalysis collect subject Screening , Week 6 , Week 12 . Subjects terminate study participation early ask complete Week 12 assessment , appropriate , prior commencement alternative therapy BCCs ( possible ) . Subjects discontinue study treatment period replace .</detailed_description>
