	<brief_summary>Patients severe respiratory disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obesity-hypoventilation syndrome ( OHS ) benefit non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) . Non-invasive ventilation consist machine ( ventilator ) blow air mask . NIV provide patient big expansion lung breathing . This good expansion help patient oxygen less waste gas ( carbon dioxide ) body . These improvement enhance survival quality life . In order provide appropriate ventilation patient , ventilator generate different type blowing : - Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) deliver constant pressure mask - Pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) deliver constant pressure mask , top , delivers pressure patient begin breathe . - Pressure control ventilation ( PCV ) , similar PSV , use fixed time generate flow patient begin breathe . These different type blow consequence patient comfort well improvement ventilation . To assess improvement ventilation , investigator currently use blood test , however , reflect overall output may miss subtle change breathe could affect patient feel . Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air ventilator . It allow non-invasive assessment effect NIV onto lung ventilation real-time . The investigator hope use EIT technology assess real-time patient lung ventilation use NIV . The investigator hope EIT provide information type blow effective comfortable others .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic lung disease sometimes progress extent patient longer clear waste gas blood . Treatment offer mask machine ( ventilator ) help people breathe aim improve lung condition . It common people 's lung affect variably , i.e . leave right top lung base lung . The way ventilator set may affect well machine deal difference . If lung well ventilator patient may find machine comfortable may effective . Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air ventilator . It allow assessment difference , previously require use invasive equipment obtain . Optimising ventilator setting administration non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) improve addition individual physiological data . This approach limit due invasive technique require obtain information , often lead less ideal NIV setting promote patient-ventilator asynchrony . It recently demonstrate group patient establish domiciliary NIV degree patient-ventilator asynchrony commonest type asynchrony trigger issue . Triggering asynchrony promote mismatch patient 's intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure ( iPEEP ) apply expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) ineffective effort contribute increased work breathe patient discomfort . Previous strategy use optimise patient trigger involved placement oesophageal catheter order measure neural respiratory drive ( NRD ) diaphragm electromyography ( EMG ) process invasive often poorly tolerate . Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) non-invasive , bedside monitoring technique provide semi-continuous , real-time information regional distribution change electrical resistivity lung tissue due variation ventilation relation reference state . Information gain repeatedly inject small alternate electric current ( usually 5 mA ) high frequency 50 - 80 kHz system skin electrode ( usually 16 ) apply circumferentially around thorax single plane 4th 6th intercostal space . While adjacent pair electrode 'injects ' current ( 'adjacent drive configuration ' ) , remain adjacent passive electrode pair measure difference electric potential . A resistivity ( impedance ) image reconstruct data mathematical algorithm use two dimensional model simplify shape represent thoracic cross-section . The resulting image posse high temporal functional resolution make possible monitor dynamic physiological phenomenon ( e.g . delay regional inflation recruitment ) breath breath basis . It important realize EIT image base image reconstruction technique require least one measurement well-defined reference state . All quantitative data relate reference indirectly quantify ( relative ) change local lung impedance ( absolute ) . EIT use mechanically ventilated patient assess recruitment optimise ventilator setting reduce risk iatrogenic ventilator associate lung injury . To date , EIT validate patient invasively ventilate self-ventilation . The investigator hope use EIT technology ass patient breathe use different ventilator mode order see one effective comfortable others . The investigator use information help set ventilator future patient .</detailed_description>
