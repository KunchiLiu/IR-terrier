	<brief_title>Proof Concept Trial Confirm That Recovery Patients Treated Intensive Care Unit Requiring Mechanical Ventilation Beneficially Affected Environmental Simulation Daytime Night Time Alternation Well Nutrition Protocol Corresponding Daily Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The homeostasis human body significantly disturbed organ ' work-relax period harmonize . Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) patient 's circadian rhythm almost inevitably upset result disease and/or medical intervention . There numerous animal study prove circadian rhythm periodic dynamic directly relate healing time hence , mortality rate . Although , one main messenger circadian synchronization melatonin , overridden temperature , number factor e.g . digestive tract . If circadian rhythm disturb , function different organ system become desynchronized chaotic . ICU environment patient-care activity bring major drawback well mainly necessary presence noise light . It show ICU setting impact patient ' sleep , easily lead delirium circadian disruption . There significant data show strong correlation delirium ICU length stay/ mortality . The focus study environmental modulation ICU control light , noise nutrition condition . Controlled light condition create artificial light daytime sleep mask night time . Earplugs use night time control noise condition . Nutrition carry daytime case enteral parenteral feeding .</detailed_description>
