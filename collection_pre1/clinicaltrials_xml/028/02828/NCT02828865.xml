	<brief_summary>Liver cancer include primary hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) metastatic liver cancer one common malignancy world . Over 10000 new case per year diagnose Taiwan . Despite many treatment option , prognosis HCC remain dismal . More 8000 people die cancer every year Taiwan . A majority ( 70 % 85 % ) patient present advance unresectable disease . In contrast , small liver cancer cure appreciable frequency . Five-year disease-free survival exceed 50 % report surgical resection , inoperable patient vascular invasion extrahepatic spread . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) recommend alternative curative therapy . However , main drawback RFA limitation tumor size location . The tumor large 5 cm diameter locate adjacent vessel , could ablate completely sometimes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Using Irreversible Electroporation Treatment Liver Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) , develop manufacture AngioDynamics US Ltd , ablate tumor fenestrating cancer cell membrane electric pulse . The anti-tumor effect result thermotherapy , also diminish adjacent vessel . Several pre-clinical study already demonstrate IRE safe effective treatment live cancer . The system approve safe European Union ( EU ) 2008 receive Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval 2010 . However , still experience use IRE tumor ablation Taiwan . In study , investigator perform IRE 40 inoperable patient liver cancer adjacent vessel suitable receive radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) investigator hospital . The investigator evaluate potential side effect ablate effect tumor abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , investigator also follow-up patient 2 year evaluate overall survival local recurrence rate . The investigator appraisal clinical feasibility advantage system study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible study : 1 . The diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) metastatic liver cancer pathologic proven , diagnosis HCC make pathology / cytology accord American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) ( 2010 ) diagnostic criterion . In brief , Nodules large 1 cm find ultrasound screen cirrhotic liver investigate either triphase multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) scan dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If appearance typical HCC ( i.e. , hypervascular arterial phase washout portal venous delay phase ) , lesion treat HCC . If finding characteristic vascular profile typical , second contrast enhance study image modality perform , lesion biopsied . Biopsies small lesion evaluate expert pathologist . Tissue clearly HCC stain available marker include cluster differentiation 34 ( CD34 ) , cytokeratin 7 ( CK7 ) , glypican 3 , heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) , glutamine synthetase improve diagnostic accuracy . 2 . Unsuitable surgical resection local ablation indicate , however , distance tumour vessel small 5 mm . 3 . Have least one , less equal 3 tumor , 4 . Each tumor must ≤ 5 cm diameter , 5 .
