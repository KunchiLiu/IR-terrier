	<brief_summary>A medical approach warrant continuous reliable local administration non-opioid analgesic drug might substantially improve post-surgery pain management CS , decrease necessity staff-dependent invasive procedure probability untoward effect follow systemic drug exposure . ReadyfusOR® formulation comprise Ropivacain-loaded single-use pump approve regional application analgesic drug , also comprise obstetric intervention . There , however , scarce scientific information efficacy benefit anesthetic drug formulation pain management follow CS mean continuous wound infiltration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Wound Infiltration Diminution Post-surgery Pain After Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During past decade rate Caesarean section increase considerably , Germany follow global trend . When compare surgical intervention , Caesarean section perceive painful . Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) associate significantly high opioid dosage , compare case medication administer patient 's request bolus attend staff . Conceivably , patient use PCA report less painful sensation . Nonetheless , several patient physician express reservation concern use opioids pain management lactating mother . Peripheral application local anesthetic ( e.g . wound infiltration peripheral nerve blockade ) show several setting reduce demand systemic drug dosage pain management . The intended effect , however , last couple hour . Feasibility subsequent bolus drug application hamper ethical concern ( invasive procedure ) well staff strain cost effectiveness consideration . Hence , medical device warrant continuous reliable administration local analgesic might substantially improve pain management obstetric patient . ReadyfusOR® medical device approve use purpose . This study record use Ropivacaine formulation ReadyfusOR® real life condition representative sample . Ropivacaine formulation ReadyfusOR® establish standard procedure diminution post-surgery pain Department Obstetrics Jena University Hospital . The gathered information use augment knowledge outcome safety Ropivacaine formulation ReadyfusOR® use treatment patient undergoing Caesarean section . Analgesic efficacy monitor defined interval observation period 48 h post-surgery use patient 's subjective rating spontaneous strain-induced pain perception , well demand auxiliary dose standard analgesic treatment . At end surgery prior closure abdomen drug infusion catheter Readyfusor® insert subfascially . An initial priming dose 10 mL 2mg/mL ropivacain injected catheter . After catheter prim initial loading dose , Readyfusor® activate surgeon nurse operate room connect wound catheter . As described product information , wound edge supply Ropivacain 48 h rate 10 mg/hour ( 5 mL/hr ) . During first 48 h post-surgery patient receive standard pain management Ibuprofen dose 600 mg administer interval 8 hour . If patient free pain Ibuprofen application reduce need . The synthetic opioid Piritramide use pain medication demand patient report mild severe pain define 5 point 10-point-Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) . In either available application option - PCA bolus injection attend nurse - dose Piritramide limit 30 mg 4 hour single application limit 3mg every 10 minute . Maximal intensity pain rest pain due mobilization ( first standing ) assess interval 12 , 24 48 h treatment introduction mean patient 's statement plot individual numeric rating scale endpoint . The primary endpoint focus assess perceive spontaneous pain intensity 24 h post-surgery . Further characterization pain-relieving effect ReadyfusOR® provide record fractional dos auxiliary opioid analgesic Piritramide administer within 12 , 24 48 h post-surgery . The individual time need recovery mobility provide additional tool treatment effect evaluation . Finally , NRS-recorded patient 's rating subjectively perceive satisfaction post-surgical pain management evaluate .</detailed_description>
