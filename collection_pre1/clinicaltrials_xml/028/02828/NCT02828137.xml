	<brief_summary>The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) proven reliable inflammatory marker atherosclerotic process predictor clinical outcome patient various cardiovascular disease . Recent study report elevated NLR associate impaired myocardial perfusion ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient . The investigator seek determine whether NLR associate coronary microcirculation assess index microcirculatory resistance ( IMR ) STEMI patient undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . A total 123 patient STEMI underwent successful primary PCI consecutively enrol . NLR admission calculate , patient divide three group accord NLR tertiles . IMR measure intracoronary thermodilution-derived method immediately index PCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 123 consecutive STEMI patient underwent successful primary PCI coronary physiologic study immediately PCI retrospectively enrol study . All patient underwent index PCI May 2009 October 2014 INHA university hospital . The definition STEMI determine current guideline . Complete blood count , include total differential WBC count , obtain time admission . Total count WBC , neutrophils , lymphocyte assess use automate blood cell counter ( XE-2100 , Sysmex Inc. , Japan ) . NLR calculate ratio neutrophil count lymphocyte count . All patient divide 3 group accord NLR tertiles . The IMR assess shortly primary PCI use thermodilution-derived method . After successful interventional reperfusion , intracoronary nitroglycerin ( 100~200μg ) administer coronary pressure guidewire ( Radi Pressure Wire 5 , Radi Medical Systems , Uppsala , Sweden ) calibrate outside patient . The guidewire equalize distal tip guide catheter , advance towards distal third infarct relate artery ( IRA ) . Three time saline injection ( 3~5 ml ) administer IRA baseline mean transit time assess . Microcirculatory hyperemia induce use adenosine infusion ( 140 μg/kg.min ) administer via peripheral venous line . During maximal hyperemia , hyperemic mean transit time ( Tmn ) measure use method prior separate saline injection . Mean aortic ( Pa ) distal coronary pressure ( Pd ) measure hyperemia . The IMR calculate formula follow : IMR = Pd x hyperemic Tmn . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) calculate ratio Pd Pa maximal hyperemic status . Coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) derive divide rest Tmn hyperemic Tmn . Continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) categorical variable number patient ( percentage ) . The one way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use compare continuous variable . Additionally , post-hoc analysis perform evaluate significant ANOVA . The Pearson 's chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use analyze categorical variable . Linear regression analysis perform investigate association NLR variables use clinical , laboratory , echocardiographic , angiographic data . A p value &lt; 0.05 regard statistically significant . All statistical analysis carry SPSS version 19.0 ( SPSS inc. , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) .</detailed_description>
