	<brief_title>Determining Potential Benefit Powered Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many individual live United States limb loss . With use prosthetic device many individual stay active , achieve medically desired physical activity level . This create risk cardiovascular disease . It think individual amputation walk less difficult get around , recent advance robotic prosthetic technology may make activity easy . However , prostheses yet evaluate determine effectiveness extend period walk . Despite goal design new device unclear whether individual use able incorporate make daily activity easier . Therefore , goal research determine effectiveness power prosthesis compare unpowered prosthesis long period walk .</detailed_description>
