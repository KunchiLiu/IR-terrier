	<detailed_description>Melanoma first cancer term increase frequency France . Prevention efficient detect melanoma good prognosis mortality remain unchanged 15 20 % patient still die melanoma . Indeed metastatic melanoma heterogeneous highly multiple mutation driven cancer highly resistant conventional treatment . Significant survival benefit demonstrate since 2011 anti-CTLA4 anti PD1 antibodies BRAF MEK inhibitor .Future improvement advance melanoma prognosis rely clinico-epidemiological study biological study aim validate identify new prognostic predictive factor base upon clinico-epidemiological histological data , genomic host tumor alteration , tumor microenvironment characteristic , individual immunological profile functional imaging . In context marketing costly innovative molecule indication , assessment resource consumption require , prospective collection economic data treatment toxicity . Large biobanks collect data cohort advance melanoma mandatory project . The `` Groupe Multidisciplinaire Français du Mélanome cutané '' ( GMFmel ) group plan build prospective cohort enrol advanced melanoma patient , MELBASE . MELBASE French national multidisciplinary project whose objective : - To provide annual instrument panel descriptive correlative analysis patient advanced melanoma France include epidemiological , clinical biological socio-economic characteristic - validate identify new clinical , epidemiological , biological prognostic factor genomic host tumor alteration , tumor microenvironment characteristic , individual immunological profile advance melanoma . - evaluate risk-benefit , impact treatment patient quality life , management cost patient treat validated future treatment metastatic melanoma . If possible , cost-effectiveness ratio wil calculate either treated patient select population patient ( base clinical biological criterion , like biomarkers ) , order identify population new therapeutic cost-effective . The project also aim define predictive biomarkers response toxicity include pharmacogenetics tumor genetics alteration , tumor microenvironment characteristic , individual immunological profile . Patients unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma enrol prospectively 1 year 3 year follow-up ( total 1000 patient enrol ) 26 French center . A database clinical monitoring metastatic patient establish associated virtual tumor bank . The database issue use biological , clinical imaging database already available center optimize project ; database also result interaction INCa genotyping platform . The information collect MELBASE include clinical constitutional factor , factor link primary melanoma , factor link previous lymph node involvement , tumor kinetics information , `` American Joint Committee Cancer '' ( AJCC ) stage inclusion various therapeutic intervention , serological marker , metastatic tumor genotyping ( one sit , one time point ) , therapeutic intervention ( medical , surgical , radiotherapy palliative strategy ) evaluation response , tolerance , medical direct cost , impact quality life , psycho-socio-economic variable include specific specific questionnaire , date death , date late news . MELBASE comprise virtual Tumor bank collect sample unresectable stage III stage IV patient enrol study . These sample available Biological Resource Centers ( CRB ) participate center consist primary melanoma ( mostly paraffin embed ) , metastatic sample ( ) ( paraffin embed frozen ) least 1 site inclusion evolution , particularly treatment modification clinically require , DNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell , plasma sample inclusion every 6 month 3 year . The computer data processing therefore ensure role data warehouse generate clinico-epidemiological report analysis virtual catalog biological material . MELBASE project consistent ethical chart hospital tumor bank publish Inca manage chart ensure participate center management autonomy availability data put database make available . A multidisciplinary scientific advisory board identify research priority base clinical practice scientific knowledge .</detailed_description>
