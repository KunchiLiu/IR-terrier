	<brief_summary>Fragility , geriatric concept recent identification define simple physical indicator . The literature suggest relate risk hospitalization , fall , institutionalization death . Some study show link heart disease , include heart failure . The link TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) however never study . A fortiori , impact fragility risk recurrent stroke TIA unknown . Several question need ask : Among old patient hospitalize TIA , proportion complete criterion frailty ? In population , correlation fragility score ABCD2 score predictive risk subsequent ischemic stroke ? In word , fragile subject TIA Have high risk ischemic stroke ( could cause strengthen prevention measure ) ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Impact Fragility Over 70 Years TIAprognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : - Frailty common among elderly patient population TIA . Compared control group literature . - Patients high fragility score ABCD2 also high score . - Patients high score fragility also significant number vascular risk factor ( include atrial fibrillation ) - Patients high score fragility also average length stay ( ALOS ) high others . So underlying question : learn well identify patient go need big structure output home . objective : - Assess feasibility place fragile test acute phase AIT USINV . - To evaluate frequency frailty among population elderly patient TIA . - Compare AIT 70 year fragile high score low score , especially ABCD2 score , vascular risk factor DMS . - Statements parameter : The fragility score : - Choice fragility score : among fragility score , use international literature score Linda Fried . Moreover , stress study relate environment USINV ( shortly , short DMS , often tired patient ) . It therefore important use study test , quick handover . The score Fried also advantage ( J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2001 , 56 ( 3 ) : M146-56 ) The first 4 item simple clinical evaluation . The 5th ( grip test ) perform device ( single gauge measure finger bend strength ) loan geriatric ward .</detailed_description>
