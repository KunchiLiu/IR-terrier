	<brief_title>Cartography Allodynic Hypoasthetic Territories Following TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence Post-surgical Pain depend surgical procedure perform , surgical site patients-dependents characteristic . Post surgical pain become chronic persist beyond two month . Chronic post-surgical pain ( CPSP ) one common complication surgery . Nerve injury surgery implicate development CPSP . Some patient CPSP neuropathic pain ( NP ) . NP pain cause damage disease affect somatosensory nervous system . It may associate abnormal cutaneous sensation hypoesthesia ( partial loss sensitivity sensory stimulus ) allodynia ( pain normally non-painful stimulus ) Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) present high risk injury infrapatellar branch saphenous nerve , thus cause appearance neuropathic post-surgical pain . Only data available concern skin area affect surgery . The goal study analyse localization allodynic hypoasthetic territory may appear TKA . The investigator include 200 patient undergoing TKA surgery CHU-Amiens-Picardie . Patient see day surgery , follow-up visit 6 week , 6 month one year postoperatively . A DN diagnostic test ( DN4 test ) perform visit . The cartography perform DN4-positive patient . In addition , patient also complete questionnaire assess intensity pain , quality life level anxiety . Thus , knowledge localization allodynic hypoasthetic territory allow efficient fast detection relief post-surgical neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
