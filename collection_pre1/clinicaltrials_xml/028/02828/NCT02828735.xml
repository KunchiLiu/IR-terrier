	<brief_title>Respiration Patterns With Impedance LINQ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Suspected arrhythmia Diastolic Heart Failure and/or Renal Failure . Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Stage 5 ( GFR = &lt; 15 mL/min ) . Diastolic Heart Failure class II class III ( class IV consider end stage nonreversible ) . Willing sign inform consent form . Greater 18 year age . Enrolled another study could confound result study , without document preapproval Medtronic study manager . Significant respiratory disease COPD pulmonary hypertension . Frequent arrhythmia , include PVC 's . Known systolic heart failure . Recent infection . Allergenic rejection reaction material use incision/insertion tool , Reveal LINQ™ ICM exterior incision closure method . Active implant cardiac medical device ( e.g . IPG , ICD , CRT , etc ) . Not suitable Reveal LINQ™ implantation ( e.g. , severe cachexia , dermatologic condition skin ) concomitant condition opinion investigator would allow safe participation study . Body condition would complicate accurate measurement respiratory effort external device deploy around chest . Not able take posture necessary study protocol able walk continuously period 6 minute . Any concomitant condition opinion investigator would allow safe participation study .</criteria>
