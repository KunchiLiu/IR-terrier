	<brief_summary>Physical therapist frequently use spinal manipulation therapy ( SMT ) treat spinal pain . However , method SMT exert effect well understood . The aim study ass potential change pain pressure threshold follow cervical lumbar spine manipulation single treatment session sit local diffuse site manipulation application . This study also attempt determine order cervical lumbar manipulation application impact pain pressure threshold change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Additive Effects Combined Spinal Manipulations Pain Pressure Threshold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim propose study add literature pertain effect spinal manipulation PPT . To date , study assess whether additive effect multiple manipulation single treatment session PPT . The propose study assess potential change PPT baseline measurement , follow single cervical lumbar manipulation , delivery second spinal manipulation perform different segment . The study design allow investigation possible additive effect , well effect first manipulation assess independently second . Order delivery cervical lumbar manipulation randomize among participant allow investigator consider possibility order manipulation impact PPT change . Research Questions 1 . Is single spinal manipulation either cervical lumbar spine associate immediate increase pain pressure threshold either locally diffusely compare treatment control ? 2 . What effect second spinal manipulation different segment immediately follow first spinal manipulation pain pressure threshold ? 3 . Is difference base order spinal manipulation administer ( cervical first , lumbar ; lumbar first , cervical ) post-intervention local diffuse pain pressure threshold ? Overview Research Design This study cross-sectional , single-blinded randomize control trial . This single session , experimental approach participant meet inclusion/exclusion criterion divide three group : treatment group 1 , treatment group 2 , control group . Group assignment perform use randomize concealed allocation . Participants undergo pain pressure threshold test use pressure algometry , follow cervical manipulation treatment group 1 lumbar manipulation treatment group 2 . The control group rest quietly allot amount time . Upon completion first intervention , second pain pressure threshold assessment perform . Treatment group 1 receive lumbar manipulation , treatment group 2 receive cervical manipulation . The control group rest quietly . Following second intervention , final pain pressure threshold assessment take . The primary dependent measure 1 ) current pain intensity report verbal numeric pain rating scale , 2 ) self-reported stiffness , 3 ) pain pressure threshold measure Newtons .</detailed_description>
