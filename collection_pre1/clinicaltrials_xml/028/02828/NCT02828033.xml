	<detailed_description>Ten ( 10 ) patient total enrol study Metroplex Clinical Research Center Dallas , TX . Patients may identify refer local area audiologist . The ANSHL study population define inclusion exclusion criterion design limit enrollment individual idiopathic , progressive , bilateral sensorineural hearing loss , ensure appropriate candidate treatment study medication , identify high likelihood comply study protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The presence progressive sensironeural hearing loss great equal 30 dB ear one frequency ( 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 , 6000 8000 Hz ) idiopathicbased clinical evaluation , blood test , radiographic imaging . 2 . Documented improvement hear audiogram 30 day treatment high dose prednisone 4060 mg/d . Improvement define 10 dB improvement pure tone average ( 5003000 dB ) improvement word identification score least 12 % either ear ( relative baseline ) . Prednisone could start screen patient may receive prednisone prior screen pre prednisone audiogram use screen audiogram study . It expect majority patient screen study fashion refer otoloaryngology initial treatment . 3 . 1875 year age 4 . Able willing give write informed consent comply requirement study protocol 5 . Negative serum pregnancy test ( woman child bear potential ) . Males Females child bear potential must agree consistently use 2 form highly effective birth control ( least 1 must barrier method ) start screen throughout study period 3 month final study drug administration . 1 . Pregnant nursing , plan become pregnant father child within 3 month receive last dose study drug 2 . Have know suspected current active infection history chronic recurrent infectious disease include , limited , chronic renal infection , chronic chest infection , chronic sinusitis , recurrent urinary tract infection , open , drain , infected skin wound . 3 . Within 2 month first study drug administration , serious infection , hospitalize infection , treat PO antibiotic longer 2 week , treat intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic infection 4 . Uncontrolled diabetes baseline visit ( define HbA1c ≥9.0 % ) 5 . Patients require dialysis 6 . Patients organ transplant 7 . Treatment systemic { nonglucocorticoid } immunosuppressant ( e.g . methotrexate , azathioprine , cyclosporine , mercaptopurine , mycophenolate mofetil , tacrolimus , sirolimus within 4 week baseline rilonacept administration . No leflunomide treatment within 8 week prior baseline administration . No etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab , tocilizumab , abatacept , natalizumab , within 2 month prior baseline visit ; No rituxan 12 month prior baseline evidence normal B cell count require . Patients previously treat anakinra ANSHL enrol . 8 . Prohibited Medications : 1 . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , protease inhibitor Pgp inhibitor . 2 . Longacting extended release form opiates . 3 . Live liveattenuated vaccine exclude course study 4 . IA IM glucocorticoid injection . Longacting steroid preparation allow study ( include suspension form dexamethasone ) . 9 . History demyelinate disease symptom suggestive multiple sclerosis 10 . Treatment live liveattenuated virus vaccine 3 month prior baseline 11 . Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 20 mL/min/1.73m2 patient plan start dialysis within year screen visit 12 . Baseline laboratory test result meet follow criterion : 1 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &lt; 8.5 g/dL ( 85 g/L ) 2 . Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 103/μL 3 . Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103/μL 4 . Total bilirubin exceed 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless consistent Gilbert 's syndrome 5 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) exceed 2 time ULN 13 . Positive history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) clinical serological testing . 14 . Presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and/or hepatitis C antibody ( HCV ) serologic test 15 . History active TB prior screen chest xray show evidence malignancy abnormality suggestive prior tuberculosis ( TB ) infection , include , limited , apical scarring , apical fibrosis , multiple calcify granuloma . 16 . A positive intradermal skin tuberculin test ( purify protein derivative [ PPD ] 5 tuberculin unit [ TU ] ) ≥5 mm induration read 48 72 hour positive QuantiFERONgold testing . Signs symptoms suggestive active TB ( e.g . new cough lasting &gt; 14 day change chronic cough , persistent fever , unintentional weight loss , night sweat ) upon review medical history and/or physical examination . If patient think falsepositive PPD prior BCG vaccination know patient negative testing obtain outside protocol M. tuberculosis infection use cellbased interferon gamma assay patient eligible enrollment . 17 . Recent close contact person active TB 18 . History latent untreated TB . Patients adequately treat latent TB eligible enrollment . 19 . Any medical condition opinion investigator could adversely affect patient 's participation interfere evaluation . This include significant concomitant illness , limited , cardiac , renal , neurological , endocrinological , metabolic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , psychiatric disease . 20 . History presence malignancy within 5 year screen visit ( successfully treat nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell basal cell carcinoma and/or localize carcinoma situ cervix ) 21 . History myeloproliferative disorder 22 . History alcohol abuse within last 5 year current intake 21 alcoholcontaining drink per week 23 . History drug abuse within 5 year prior screen 24 . Patients previous exposure rilonacept 25 . Use investigational drug within 30 day within 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior screen visit 26 . Sexually active men woman childbearing potential unwilling practice adequate contraception study ( adequate contraceptive measure define use two highly effective form birth control , include stable use oral contraceptive prescription pharmaceutical contraceptive ; intrauterine device ; bilateral tubal ligation ; vasectomy ; condom plus contraceptive sponge , foam , jelly , diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge , foam , jelly ) 27 . Known moderatetosevere liver disease ( ChildPugh class B C ) 28 . Known hypersensitivity CHO cell derive therapeutic proteins component rilonacept</criteria>
