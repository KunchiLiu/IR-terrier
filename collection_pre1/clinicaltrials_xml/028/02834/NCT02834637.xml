	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer common cancer woman age 15-44 year East Africa , mortality rate high . HPV vaccine effective give girl yet acquire HPV infection . In Tanzania , HPV vaccine show safe , acceptable deliver high coverage ( around 80 % ) . However , cost delivering HPV vaccine considerably high cost traditional infant/child vaccination . This primarily cost establish outreach programmes associate personnel cost include nurse must spend significant time away post deliver vaccine , especially multiple dos need . There global interest simplify HPV vaccine delivery reduce number dos . If single dose could give , could halve cost delivery , make accessible population need . Recently , WHO recommend 2 dos HPV vaccine could give young girl , base study high upper middle income country . However Africa high rate infection like malaria worm affect immune response vaccine . It essential know reduce number dos reduce protective immune response vaccine . The investigator conduct trial Tanzanian girl age 9-14 year establish whether single dose HPV vaccine produce immune response likely effective prevent cervical cancer . Two different HPV vaccine , bivalent ( 2-v ) vaccine protect HPV 16/18 ( cause 70 % cancer ) new 9-valent ( 9-v ) vaccine protect 9 HPV type , compare . The trial randomise 900 girl 6 group follow 36 month . Girls receive 2-v 9-v HPV vaccine , 1 , 2 3 dos . Girls receive 1 2 dos compare receive 3 dos vaccine , ensure reduce dose regimen produce immune response inferior standard 3 dos . The immune response study also compare result country vaccine show protective . This provide information whether reduced number dos likely protective Africa . This work extremely important informing future HPV vaccination strategy one first randomise trial 1 2 dos HPV vaccine Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection primary cause cervical cancer , major public health problem Africa . Currently three vaccine ( Cervarix , Gardasil® Gardasil-9® ) offer excellent protection HPV infection vaccine-related HPV genotype . The objective trial demonstrate non-inferiority immune responses 1 dose HPV vaccine compare recommend 2 3 dos vaccine evaluate HPV 16/18-specific seropositivity , antibody avidity memory B cell response M36 . Specifically , investigator determine whether single dose 2-valent HPV vaccine ( Cervarix , protect HPV 16/18 genotype ) new 9-valent HPV vaccine ( Gardasil-9 , protect HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 ) produce immune response non-inferior observe 3 dos vaccine give HIV-negative 9-14 year old girls malaria-endemic region Tanzania . The trial also determine whether World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) recently recommend 2 dose strategy girl age 15 year produce similar immune response Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) compare previously recommend 3 dose schedule . In addition , cost-effectiveness alternative dose schedule two vaccine explore . The trial enrol 900 girl resident Mwanza un-blinded , individually-randomised trial 6 arm . Arm A comprise participant randomise receive 3 dos 2-valent vaccine , Arm B randomise receive 2 dos 2-valent vaccine Arm C randomise receive 1 dose 2-valent vaccine . Arms D , E F participant randomise receive 3 , 2 1 dose 9-valent vaccine , respectively . The effect different dose schedule type HPV vaccine range immune response measure 36 month first dose . The protocol harmonise , laboratory procedure immunological endpoint cross-validated , large HPV vaccine dose-reduction efficacy trial plan NIH Costa Rica examine protective effect vaccine give 1 2 doses.This trial allow examination quality durability antibody response , safety cost-effectiveness reduce dose schedule compare originally recommend 3 dose schedule population high burden malaria infection may affect vaccine immune response .</detailed_description>
