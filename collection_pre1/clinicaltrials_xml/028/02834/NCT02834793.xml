	<criteria>Participants must diagnosis LennoxGastaut Syndrome ( LGS ) evidence : 1. one type generalize seizure , include drop seizure ( atonic , tonic , myoclonic ) least 6 month Visit 1 ; 2. electroencephalogram ( EEG ) report diagnostic criterion LGS point history ( abnormal background activity accompany slow , spike , wave pattern &lt; 2.5 Hz ) . Participants must least 2 year old time consent . Participants must &lt; 11 year old onset LGS . Participants must experience least 2 drop seizure per week 4week Baseline Period precede randomization . Participants must receive 1 3 concomitant antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) stable dose least 30 day Visit 1 ( vagal nerve stimulation ( VNS ) ketogenic diet count AEDs ) . In investigator 's opinion , parent caregiver must able keep accurate seizure diary . Body weight least 8 kg . Presence progressive neurological disease Presence drop seizure cluster individual seizure reliably count ( seizure cluster define ≥2 drop seizure &lt; 5 minute 2 consecutive seizure ) Prior treatment perampanel discontinuation due safety issue ( related perampanel ) Prior treatment perampanel must discontinue least 30 day Visit 1 Evidence clinically significant disease ( eg , cardiac , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal disease , hepatic disease ) opinion investigator ( ) could affect participant 's safety study conduct Scheduled epilepsyrelated surgery form surgery project course study Ketogenic diet VNS , unless stable ongoing , least 30 day Visit 1 Treatment investigational drug device 30 day Visit 1 Status epilepticus within 12 week Visit 1 If felbamate use concomitant AED , participant must felbamate least 1 year , stable dose 60 day Visit 1 . They must history white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≤2500/microliters ( μL ) , platelets &lt; 100,000/μL , liver function test ( LFTs ) &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , indication hepatic bone marrow dysfunction receive felbamate . Concomitant use vigabatrin : participant take vigabatrin past must discontinue least 5 month Visit 1 , must documentation show evidence vigabatrinassociated clinically significant abnormality automate visual perimetry test Have multiple drug allergy severe drug reaction AED ( ) , include dermatological ( eg , StevensJohnson syndrome ) , hematological , organ toxicity reaction Evidence significant active hepatic disease . Stable elevation liver enzyme , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) due concomitant medication ( ) allow &lt; 3 time ULN Adrenocorticotropic hormone within 6 month Visit 1 Had history anoxic episodes require resuscitation within 6 month Visit 1 Females breastfeed pregnant Screening Baseline ( document positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ ßhCG ] minimum sensitivity 25 International Units per Liter ( IU/L ) equivalent unit ßhCG hCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . Females childbearing potential : a. unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day study entry agree use highly effective method contraception ( eg , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 28 day study drug discontinuation . Females use hormonal contraceptive contain levogesterol must another form contraception well . b . Are currently abstinent , agree use doublebarrier method ( describe ) refrain sexual activity study period 28 day study drug discontinuation . c. Are use hormonal contraceptive stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week dose agree use contraceptive study 28 day study drug discontinuation . ( NOTE : All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal [ amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ] sterilize surgically [ i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ] ) . Had intermittent use benzodiazepine 4 single administration month Visit 1 A prolonged QT/QTc interval ( QTc &gt; 450 millisecond [ m ] ) demonstrate repeat electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Hypersensitivity study drug excipients Any history medical condition concomitant medical condition opinion investigator ( ) would compromise participant 's ability safely complete study Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive Active viral hepatitis ( B C ) demonstrate positive serology Screening Psychotic disorder ( ) unstable recurrent affective disorder ( ) evident use antipsychotic prior suicide attempt ( ) within approximately last 2 year History drug alcohol dependency abuse within approximately last 2 year ; use illegal recreational drug Concomitant use medication know inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP3A ) include , limited : rifampin , troglitazone , St. John 's Wort , efavirenz , nevirapine , glucocorticoid ( topical usage ) , modafinil , pioglitazone , rifabutin Use AEDs recommend Epilepsy Treatment Guidelines use LGS include , limited carbamazepine , gabapentin , oxcarbazepine , phenytoin , pregabalin , tiababine , vigabatrin Concomitant use cannabinoids</criteria>
