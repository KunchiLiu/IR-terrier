	<brief_summary>Myocardial fibrosis recognize pathologic entity extracellular matrix remodel . Diffuse , reactive fibrosis increasingly recognize variety condition despite absence ischemia . Regardless etiology , fibrosis lead increase myocardial stiffness thereby promote cardiac dysfunction . This dysfunction may present clinically symptoms cardiac failure although often subclinical disease . Various image modality collagen biomarkers use surrogate marker assess presence , extent , turnover myocardial fibrosis . Techniques use echocardiography , cardiac magnetic resonance , nuclear imaging develop detect early feature systolic diastolic leave ventricular dysfunction impair contractile reserve . Further identification diffuse reactive fibrosis may possible evolve cardiac magnetic resonance molecular technique . The goal protocol validate cardiac magnetic resonance image new tool fibrosis quantification histology standard reference .</brief_summary>
