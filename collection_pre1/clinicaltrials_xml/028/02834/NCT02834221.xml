	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Femoral Vein Accessibility , Safety Time Atrial Fibrillation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) therapy atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increase . Multiple femoral vein cannulation mandatory procedure . There mainly two method cannulate femoral vein ; anatomical landmark real-time ultrasound-guided . As high anticoagulant level require procedure , 0-13 % vascular access complication . Real-time ultrasound assistance central venous catheter cannulation proven reduce complication . In field AF treatment , multiple femoral vein cannulation require many catheter require procedure large sheath insert high anticoagulant level procedure . In set , use ultrasound use well study . The current study confirm whether real time ultrasound-guided femoral vein cannulation PVI prevent complication , reduce puncture time , puncture attempt accidental artery puncture compare conventional anatomical approach . Two seethes femoral vein go cannulate . The study design multicenter prospective randomize trial compare safety efficacy use ultrasound-guided anatomical landmark approach . Also time cannulation , number puncture attempt , need X-ray cannulation analyze setting patient factor include age , body mass index sex .</detailed_description>
