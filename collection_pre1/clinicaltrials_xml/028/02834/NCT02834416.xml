Researchers show exercise , specifically one-on-one supervised exercise improve many side effect ADT . However , exercise program men ADT widely available . More question need answered order exercise program become part PC treatment . First , program require few resource , group-exercise home-based exercise , also improve ADT side-effects ? Second , exercise-related benefit continue beyond structured exercise program ? And make people continue exercise ? Third , exercise program cost-effective ? In study , investigator compare : ( ) group supervise in-centre ( b ) home-based support exercise program see program effective men PC ADT . The investigator also look motivates people continue exercise structure program program complete examine exercise program cost-effective . Participants ( men PC ADT ) recruit one follow cancer centre : Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Toronto , Tom Baker Cancer Centre Calgary , Juravinski Cancer Centre Hamilton , Southlake Regional Health Centre Newmarket . When patient agrees participate , patient randomly place 1 2 exercise program . All program include type exercise ( aerobic , resistance flexibility ) participant exercise 4-5 day per week 30 minute per day ( tolerate ) length program ( 6 month ) . The investigator look men PC ADT respond exercise program measuring quality life ( QOL ) , fatigue different physical measure , , exercise program .
