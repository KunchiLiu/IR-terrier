	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine dose poly-ICLC safe tolerable combine pembrolizumab patient colon cancer . This study also evaluate combination pembrolizumab poly-ICLC activates immune system patient 's blood inside tumor ; affect size number tumor ( ) patient ; effective combination patient colon cancer unlikely respond pembrolizumab alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab + Poly-ICLC MRP Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mismatch repair gene normally serve fix small glitch occur DNA copy cell divide . In 1993 , researcher discover mutation human mismatch repair gene play key role development certain form colorectal cancer ; individual deficient mismatch repair gene high risk colorectal cancer . Accumulating evidence show immunotherapy may effective cancer . Programmed cell death protein 1 , also know PD-1 , function immune checkpoint , down-regulating immune system prevent activation T-cells , turn reduces autoimmunity promote self-tolerance . A new class immunotherapy drug block PD-1 , PD-1 inhibitor , activate immune system attack tumor therefore use vary success treat type cancer . Current clinical trial show patient whose tumor mismatch repair deficient likely respond immune-boosting anti-PD-1 drugs—such pembrolizumab—than tumor proficient mismatch repair . The idea great number DNA glitches tumor cell , abnormal protein produce—and abnormal protein generate , great odds body 's immune cell regard tumor cell `` foreign '' target destruction . Thus far , PD-1 inhibitor show great promise mismatch repair deficient cancer patient , mismatch repair proficient ( MRP ) cancer patient . In clinical trial , investigator hypothesize treat MRP colon cancer patient immunostimulating agent poly-ICLC generate inflammatory response , increase epitope recognition development tumor reactive T-cells tumor site . However , interferon alpha gamma produce poly-ICLC increase PD-L1 expression limit new T-cell development . Thus , PD1 blockade increase effectiveness treatment pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>
