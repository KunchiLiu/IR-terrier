	<brief_title>Genioglossus Muscle Training Snoring Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder characterize intermittent narrowing closure upper airway sleep . Loss muscle tone sleep onset decrease ventilatory drive follow loss wakefulness stimuli breathe combine result upper airway closure patient structurally susceptible upper airway . The genioglossus ( GG , tongue ) muscle play important role maintain upper airway patency . The GG responsible tongue protrusion stiffen tongue prevents posterior tongue displacement upper airway closure . The GG phasic respiratory muscle . One demonstrate inspiratory burst GG EMG activity slightly precede onset inspiratory activity respiratory pump muscle . The inspiratory burst GG activity also increase response negative pressure upper airway help maintain upper airway patency . In OSA patient response blunt . While one study find difference protrusion muscle strength group OSA patient ( apnea hypopnea index , AHI = 20/hour ) normal control ( Mortimore et al ) wide variability muscle strength similar AHI value . Another study ( Oh et al ) find correlation tongue protrusion strength apnea index ( low strength , high apnea index ) . It hypothesize strength training GG reduce snore sleep apnea augment rest GG tone enhance ability muscle respond negative upper airway pressure . Training upper airway muscle include tongue often use rehabilitation patient prior cerebrovascular accident damage due surgical resection cancer . Typically , patient press tongue back upper teeth ( direction upward forward ) . However , believe tongue protrusion best train active forward protrusion tongue teeth load . To facilitate GGs train participant push spring load piston forward tongue . The piston fit inside out chamber . The piston also connect force measuring device estimate protrusive tongue force . Two group participant examine : Group 1 : primary snore Group 2 : mild moderate OSA patient ( apnea-hypopnea index &lt; 30/hour ) severely obese ( BMI &lt; 40 Kg/M2 ) significant structural abnormality upper airway muscle dysfunction . This preliminary investigation consist randomize controlled trial ( train versus sham training ) two month daily training ( 5 7 day week ) . A home sleep study ( include EEG ) perform follow training . The change apnea-hypopnea index adjust sleep stage body position compare . Use home sleep study dramatically reduce cost study . A sleep technologist educate subject performance training maneuver meet weekly observe subject 's technique measure tongue strength . A training log keep subject use training schedule sheet train directly monitor least 2 time weekly study clinician ( electronically via facetime , skype direct observation ) .</detailed_description>
