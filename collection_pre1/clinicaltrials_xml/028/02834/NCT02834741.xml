	<detailed_description>This first human study NYX-2925 . This randomized , double-blind , sponsor-open , placebo-controlled , single multiple ascend dose , parallel safety , tolerability , PK study oral NYX-2925 healthy volunteer . The single ascending dose phase comprise five dose group . There 3 dose group multiple ascend dose phase . One open-label dose group repeat multiple ascend dose phase collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample , order explore central nervous system penetration . One elderly cohort ( single dose ) complete single multiple dose escalation group complete . One open-label dose group repeat single ascend dose phase collect CSF sample , order establish complete cerebral spinal fluid pharmacokinetic profile . The influence food ( `` food effect '' ) bioavailability pharmacokinetics NYX-2925 explore one dose group single ascend dose phase . A data review committee review safety tolerability ( adverse event relevant data ) , plus preliminary pharmacokinetic data , prior proceed next high dose group , cohort , and/or phase study , well administration feed dose food effect group . Stopping rule individual study participant dose group cohort establish order evaluate dose escalation scheme , need stop terminate dosing , establish maximum tolerated dose . If cohort stop due safety tolerability concern , previous cohort may repeat determine high tolerate dose .</detailed_description>
