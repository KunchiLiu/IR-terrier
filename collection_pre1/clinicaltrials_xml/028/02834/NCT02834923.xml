	<brief_summary>The Patient Centered Medical Home ( PCMH ) Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) complementary clinical intervention framework commonly invoke support well type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) outcomes primary care . Self-management Support ( SMS ) core component PCMH CCM , focus central role patient manage illness engage adopt healthy behavior promote optimal clinical outcome . Despite recognize importance , SMS program diabetes continue demonstrate limited effectiveness real-world primary care . SMS comprise two complementary interactive component : ( 1 ) patient engagement ( e.g. , process elicit respond patient emotion motivation related health behavior ) , ( 2 ) behavioral change tool ( e.g. , select specific goal , create action plan ) . While several sophisticated SMS program develop T2DM , vast majority design narrow focus behavioral change tool , largely ignore unique aspect patient context drive maintain health behavior . Considerable clinical research suggest addition structure , evidenced-based program patient engagement maximize effectiveness SMS program patient T2DM primary care . To date systematic study degree fully integrate enhance patient engagement part SMS increase initiation maintenance behavior change time , kinds patient enhanced patient engagement essential . To address gap , investigator compare state-of-the-art , evidence-based SMS behavior change tool program , call Connection Health ( CTH ) , enhanced CTH program include practical , time-efficient patient engagement protocol , create program integrate comprehensive approach SMS , call `` Enhanced Engagement CTH '' ( EE-CTH ) . The current study directly test added benefit EE-CTH CTH regard self-management behavior glycemic control resource-limited community health center , vast number patient T2DM ethnically diverse medically vulnerable population receive care . The investigator use effectiveness-implementation hybrid design , employ `` Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance '' ( RE-AIM ) framework test two SMS program T2DM . This provide critical information support dissemination implementation effective SMS program resource-limited primary care setting , serve diverse medically vulnerable population much gain improved SMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-arm , 14 month pragmatic cluster randomize trial evaluate add benefit EE-CTH relative CTH patient T2DM primary care . Primary care practice ( patient ) randomly assign receive deliver CTH EE-CTH innovative effectiveness-implementation hybrid design . Using RE-AIM framework , investigator evaluate program effectiveness real world setting , time gathering information program reach , adoption , implementation maintenance . CTH EE-CTH practice training delivery follow separate standardize protocol , support provide practice staff training , ongoing supervision case presentation , practice improvement team assist practice facilitator address issue staff patient flow . Practice train facilitation note , conjunction feedback patient advisory council , capture integrated identify barrier facilitator implementation process inform dissemination effort . Beyond requirement study , practice permit use EE-CTH CTH patient wish , enable investigator document program 's reach within practice . Patients study arm receive intervention minimum two primary care appointment ( baseline follow-up 6 12 month ) .</detailed_description>
