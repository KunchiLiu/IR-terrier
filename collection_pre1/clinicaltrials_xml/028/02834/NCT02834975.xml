	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize tumor cell kill cytotoxic chemotherapy expose immune system high level tumor antigens.The combination Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Pembrolizumab invigorate tumor-specific T-cell immunity set inhibit PD-L1/PD-1 signaling , may result deep durable response compare standard chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab , Paclitaxel , Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer ( EOC ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , open-label , phase II study ass pathologic objective response rate ( complete response + partial response ) patient treat pembrolizumab , paclitaxel carboplatin advance stage III IV Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Carcinoma ( EOC ) . Eligible patient undergo tissue biopsy confirm diagnosis , follow 3 4 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) . NACT paclitaxel carboplatin combination pembrolizumab . A cycle consist pembrolizumab 200mg ( IV ) , paclitaxel 175mg/m2 ( IV ) , carboplatin area curve ( AUC ) 5 6 , day 1 every 21 day . The length cycle 21 day . This regimen follow interval debulking surgery ( IDS ) . Adjuvant chemotherapy ( ACT ) consist 3 4 cycle paclitaxel carboplatin plus pembrolizumab , every 21 day . At discretion treat physician dose-dense paclitaxel may administer adjuvant set weekly ( instead q3 week ) plus carboplatin q21 day .</detailed_description>
