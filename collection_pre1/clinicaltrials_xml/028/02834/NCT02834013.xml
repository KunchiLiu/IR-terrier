	<brief_title>Nivolumab Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Rare Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 overall response rate ( ORR ) subsets patient advance rare cancer treat ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity cohort . II . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , clinical benefit rate ; estimate immune-related ORR ( irORR ) , immune-related PFS ( irPFS ) unidimensional immune-related response criterion . III . To collect specimen bank use future correlative biomarker research study . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 ipilimumab IV 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 year registration .</detailed_description>
