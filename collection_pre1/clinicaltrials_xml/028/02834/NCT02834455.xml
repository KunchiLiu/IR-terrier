	<brief_summary>Recurrent unilateral , non-infectious pleural exudate suspicious primary secondary pleural malignancy . Both condition associate 5-year survival 10 % . Work-up difficult , pleural surface large &lt; 33 % pleural malignancy shed malignant cell pleural fluid . Even , additional tissue biopsy need establish mutation status target therapy . Optimal image guide tissue sample pivotal . PET-CT high sensitivity conventional CT detect malignant lesion &gt; 10mm . However , randomise trial investigated difference diagnostic accuracy , time-to-diagnosis , economics . Falsely PET-positive lesion e.g . colon however , lead derive test CT alone . Gold standard pleural tissue sample surgical ( VATS ) thoracoscopy , allow direct visual guiding tissue sample pleural surface . Yet , globally medical ( pleuroscopy ) thoracoscopy widely use : cheaper , outpatient procedure , allow sample parietal pleura . To date , randomise study compare medical surgical thoracoscopy concern diagnostic hit rate , adverse event , economics . The investigator perform two randomized study investigate whether 1 . PET/CT comparable CT alone 2 . VATS comparable pleuroscopy concern hit rate , total investigation perform , time-to-diagnosis .</brief_summary>
