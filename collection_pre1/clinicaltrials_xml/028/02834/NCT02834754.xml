	<criteria>1 . Are men woman &gt; 18 year age screening . 2 . Curative resection ileocolonic anastomosis Crohn 's disease . Patients isolated fibrostenotic ( noninflammatory ) minimal ( clinically significant ) disease elsewhere gastrointestinal resect also include . 3 . Participants receive preoperative vedolizumab therapy may include . 4 . Concomitant medication : All concomitant medication time surgery discontinue postoperatively . 5 . Men woman childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measure ( e.g. , abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide , implantable injectable contraceptive surgical sterilization ) duration study continue precaution 6 month receive last infusion ) . 6 . Antibiotics treatment Crohn 's disease ( eg . ciprofloxacin metronidazole ) allowable must discontinue within 12 week surgery . Antibiotics treatment concomitant infection allowable throughout duration study long primary purpose antibiotic therapy primary treatment Crohn 's disease . 7 . Screening laboratory test must meet screening criterion ( Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL , White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L , Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 x 109/L SGOT ( ASTaspartate aminotransferase ) &lt; 3 time upper normal limit ) . 8 . Are capable provide write informed consent , consent must obtain prior conduct protocolspecified procedure . 9 . Are willing adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 10 . Participants require temporary divert ileostomy takedown include . These would participant undergo resective surgery primary ileocolonic anastomosis require temporary divert ostomy proximal anastomotic site . Participants eligible study upon takedown divert ileostomy 1 . Participants great 10 year Crohn 's disease require FIRST resection short ( &lt; 10cm ) fibrostenotic stricture . The rationale exclude participant historically group participant low risk recurrence therefore , would group target postoperative medical therapy . 2 . Macroscopically active disease anastomosis time surgery . 3 . Presence stoma . 4 . Prior severe infusion reaction vedolizumab , i.e . anaphylaxis , bronchospasm , hypotension . 5 . History anaphylaxis chimeric protein . 6 . Any following medication take within 12 week surgery : cyclosporine , tacrolimus , sirolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , investigational drug . Patients take medication 12 week prior surgery allow study 7 . At time screen participant positive stool culture enteric pathogen , pathogenic ovum parasite , Clostridium difficile toxin clinically significant sign enteric infection , i.e . diarrhea , fever , abdominal pain . participant eligible enrollment stool culture positive clinically significant sign symptom infection receive appropriate antibiotic treatment . A repeat stool culture obtain completion antibiotic treatment . 8 . Women pregnant , nursing , plan pregnancy trial within 6 month last infusion ( include father 's plan father child within 6 month last infusion ) . 9 . Have opportunistic infection ( eg , herpes zoster [ shingle ] , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis carinii , aspergillosis , histoplasmosis , mycobacteria TB ) within 6 month screen . 10 . Have chest radiograph within 3 month prior screen show evidence malignancy , infection , abnormality . 11 . Documentation seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 12 . Documentation positive test hepatitis B surface antigen history document hepatitis C. 13 . Have current sign symptom systemic lupus erythematosus , severe , progressive , uncontrolled renal , hepatic , hematologic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , pulmonary , cardiac , neurologic , cerebral disease . 14 . Presence transplant solid organ ( exception corneal transplant &gt; 3 month prior randomization ) . 15 . Have current know malignancy condition treat history malignancy within 5 year prior screen ( except squamous basal cell carcinoma skin fully excise evidence recurrence ) . 16 . Have history lymphoproliferative disease include lymphoma , sign symptom suggestive possible lymphoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy unusual size location ( eg , node posterior triangle neck , intraclavicular , epitrochlear , periaortic area ) , splenomegaly . 17 . Have know substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) dependency within previous 3 year , history noncompliance medical regimen , condition/circumstance could interfere subject 's adherence protocol requirement ( eg , psychiatric disease , lack motivation , travel , etc ) . 18 . Are unable unwilling undergo multiple venipuncture poor tolerability lack easy access 19 . Have chronic recurrent infectious disease include , limited , chronic renal infection , chronic chest infection ( eg , bronchiectasis ) , sinusitis , recurrent urinary tract infection ( recurrent pyelonephritis chronic nonremitting cystitis ) , open , drain , infected skin wound , ulcer . 20 . Have serious infection ( eg , hepatitis , pneumonia , pyelonephritis ) , hospitalize infection , treat intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic infection within 2 month prior randomization . The exception participant whose infection direct consequence Crohn 's disease completely resolve surgery , e.g . participant abscess related penetrate Crohn 's disease terminal ileum sign infection surgery . Less serious infection ( eg , acute upper respiratory tract infection , enteric infection without sign symptom simple urinary tract infection ) need consider exclusion discretion investigator . 21 . Have serious concomitant illness could interfere subject 's participation trial . 22 . Current use prescription dose chronic frequent use overthecounter dos nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , except lowdose aspirin prevention heart attack , unstable angina , transient ischemic attack . 23 . Have ulcerative colitis . 24 . Are participate another investigative trial participation trial . 25 . Use investigational drug within 30 day prior randomization within 5 halflives investigational agent , whichever longer .</criteria>
