	<brief_title>A Study TAK-659 Combination With Nivolumab Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test TAK-659.This study look determination MTD/RP2D efficacy measure ORR participant take TAK-659 combination nivolumab . The study include dose escalation phase ( Part 1 ) dose expansion phase ( Part 2 ) . The study enroll approximately 120 participant , approximately 9-12 dose escalation phase approximately 36 3 dose expansion cohort . Participants assign 1 4 treatment group : - Part 1 : Advanced Solid Tumors - Part 2 : Metastatic TNBC - Part 2 : Metastatic NSCLC - Part 2 : Metastatic HNSCC All participant ask take tablet TAK-659 time day throughout study . Participants also receive intravenous infusion nivolumab ( within 30 minute TAK-650 dose ) every 2 week . This multi-center trial conduct globally . The overall time receive treatment study approximately 12 month . Participants assess disease response PD PFS follow-up 6 month ( participant discontinue due reason PD ) OS follow-up 12 month last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
