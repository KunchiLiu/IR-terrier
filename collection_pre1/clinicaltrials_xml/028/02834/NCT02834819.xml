	<brief_title>Nebulized 3 % Hypertonic Saline vs. Standard Care Patients With Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize control single-blinded study patient 3-18 month age present Children 's Hospital Colorado ED bronchiolitis season , diagnose mild moderate bronchiolitis persistent hypoxia start Children 's Hospital Colorado Home Oxygen pathway ( see attach clinical care guideline ) . Investigators aim enroll 220 patient . Patients identify research assistant ED , base physician diagnosis bronchiolitis , hypoxia require &lt; 0.5L oxygen NC . A research assistant approach family go informed consent process . If consent obtain , patient randomize one two study arm via computer generate randomization table . In order arrange respiratory therapy , research assistant blind . There age block randomization scheme , therefore patient age 3-12 month randomize separately patient 12.1-18 month ensure equal distribution age range arm . The experimental arm consist patient receive nebulized treatment 4ml 3 % hypertonic saline , administer respiratory therapist , well supportive care need . Patients control arm receive supportive care , current standard care Children 's Hospital Colorado . The pharmacist randomize patient note . After consent obtain provider perform pre-intervention clinical severity score evaluation patient study arm utilize clinical severity score tool describe Wang et al.19 Respiratory therapy provide nebulized treatment patient randomize receive hypertonic saline . Removal equipment follow treatment aid ensure blind physician treatment arm . At 90 minute treatment hypertonic saline order place patient control arm , patient arm undergo second clinical severity score provider . At time provider turn oxygen administer treatment arm room air challenge . The RN notify patient oxygen therapy restart oxygen patient saturation &lt; 87 % ( indicated continuous pulse oximetry ) oxygen restart 0.5L NC . Patients arm longer require oxygen observe minimum 4 hour ensure remain stable room air , appropriate oral intake , sleep without de-saturation . At point patient wean oxygen becomes hypoxic ( saturation &lt; 87 % ) , require &lt; 0.5L oxygen NC return home oxygen observation protocol . If period observation patient require &gt; 0.5L oxygen wake sleep period , take adequate oral intake , demonstrate respiratory distress , physician discretion , patient may admit inpatient service management . Patients arm receive follow-up phone call assess duration amount oxygen , well adverse outcome . Patients discharge home room air receive 1 phone call post-discharge day # 7 ( range 6-8 ) . Patients discharge home oxygen receive phone call day # 7 ( range 6-8 ) . Calls make study study investigator Emergency Department ( ED ) research assistant . During follow-up phone call , caregiver ask Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) follow-up visit , future schedule PCP visit , adverse event include increased work breathing , increase oxygen requirement , repeat ED visit researcher institution , outside hospital admission , intensive care unit admission intubation , instruction wean oxygen give PCP . If parent question concern , question direct nurse , fellow , attend provider . Data subject collect data collection sheet follow-up phone call PCP call . Data enter database secure server de-identified . All identifier remove data set . The Electronic Health Record review verify return visit . If return visit document EPIC ( electronic health record software ) , data type admission ( general pediatrics intensive care unit ) advance airway intervention intubation , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) .</detailed_description>
