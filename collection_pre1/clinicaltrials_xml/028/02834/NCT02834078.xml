	<brief_summary>According International Diabetes Federation , one every 12 individual diabetic ( 8 % world population ) . Major risk factor diabetes aspect modern life include obesity , over-weight , high-risk behavior like smoking , alcohol , multiple drug use-recreational prescribed , environmental risk factor like inactivity lack exercise . However window opportunity health disease , pre-diabetes . Pre-diabetes define American Diabetes Association Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) 7.8 -11.0 mmol/l , Impaired Fasting Glucose Test ( IFT ) 5.6-6.9mmol/l add Glycosylated Hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 5.7 % 6.4 % . Though plenty drug available significantly impair glucose metabolism ( include oral hypoglycemic agent insulin ) , use marginally impaired glucose metabolism questionable due risk untoward hypoglycemia . On hand , herbal product like curcumin , single ingredient poor bioavailability problem restrict use standalone treatment . Inulin work pre-biotic help maintain gut microbiota consider precursor progress prediabetes diabetes . However , role primary pathophysiology impair glucose metabolism , i.e . pancreatic β cell dysfunction , insulin resistance , hepatic gluconeogenesis intestinal glucose absorption . Resveratrol omega-3 basically work anti-oxidant pathway . None popular ingredient study role structural functional health pancreatic β cell important prediction progress marginally impair glucose metabolism significantly impair glucose metabolism . It unmet need develop product improve insulin sensitivity , also help preserve structural functional health pancreatic β cell . It also need improve overall metabolic endothelial health person consider close association impair glucose metabolism parameter . The propose supplement - `` Berberine GlucoGold `` - improved version successfully market supplement - Berberine GlucoDefense . It balance composition ingredient complement way along individual role glucose metabolism also take care overall bioavailability stability supplement . As per previous data ingredient , supplement also expect preserve structural functional health pancreatic β cell . The ingredient also know positive effect overall metabolic endothelial health . Thus BGG develop address unmet need area glucose metabolism overall metabolic health .</brief_summary>
