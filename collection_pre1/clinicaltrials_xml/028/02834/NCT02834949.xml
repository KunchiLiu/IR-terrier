This first control study demonstrate supplement traditional BMIs improve outcomes . The current study extend promise pilot result ( ) increase efficacy behavioral economic SFAS include booster contact , ( b ) increase power generalizability recruit 425 student two university include no-treatment control group , ( c ) measure drinking , well behavioral economic mechanism mediator moderator intervention outcome ( delay discounting , alcohol reinforce efficacy , substance-free reinforcement ) 5 time point sixteen month period , ( ) evaluate economic cost benefit associate SFAS .
