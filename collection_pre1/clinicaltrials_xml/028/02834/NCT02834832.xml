	<brief_title>Novel Coating Minimize Bacterial Adhesions Tooth Wear Denture Acrylic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Denture stomatitis prevalent disease among removable denture wearer . The cause disease stem myriad factor include host immunity poor oral hygiene . Denture acrylic material conducive growth adhesion bacteria porous nature . The application plasma enhance chemical vapor deposit ( PECVD ) coating surface acrylic denture produce less porous surface may minimize adhesion bacteria therefore colonization . The goal application coating help minimize occurrence denture stomatitis . Another issue removable denture low wear resistance denture teeth . The application coating denture teeth minimize wear teeth prolong life removable denture .</detailed_description>
