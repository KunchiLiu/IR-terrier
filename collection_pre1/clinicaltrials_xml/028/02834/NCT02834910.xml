	<brief_summary>Enterobacteriaceae bacteria gastrointestinal tract also frequently involve bacterial infection , especially urinary tract infection . Because presence gut , bacteria expose antibiotic treatment administer patient . Therefore , many antibiotic resistance mechanism observe . Quinolone antibiotic often use distribution body , great number bacterial specie sensitive antibiotic possibility give oral treatment . For long time transferable resistance gene quinolones one bacterium another observe . This phenomenon demonstrate 1998 bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae specie carry qnrA gene encodes protein protect target antibiotic bacteria . Since several gene observe . These gene reduce sensitivity bacteria without ever reach detectable resistance level test commonly use laboratory . However , gene often find among enterobacteria combination mechanism resistance class antibiotic include beta-lactam antibiotic widely use antibiotic . Moreover , consider quinolone administration bacteria carry qnr gene could promote emergence mutant resistant quinolones high-level . That furthers multiresistance emergence bacteria already resistant beta-lactam antibiotic . The aim study perform April 2008 March 2009 collect strain resistant beta-lactams production enzyme , call extended-spectrum beta-lactamase determine quinolone resistance gene frequency bacteria . Meanwhile , control patient select seek emergence gene risk factor . The clinical study fail identify specific risk factor , however , biological study enhance knowledge issue setting-up method rapid detection plasmidic mediate quinolones resistance gene description new plasmid contain qnr gene , qnrD , whose study still ongoing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The multidrug resistance Enterobacteriaceae recur concern treatment patient . Given epidemic character , bacteria produce extended spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBLs ) subject extensive costly preventive measure . Gene location first describe ESBL plasmid could transfer one species another often associate resistance aminoglycoside . Quinolone resistance transferable . In 1998 , discover Klebsiella pneumoniae carry qnr A plasmid gene encode protein protect girases topoisomerase IV quinolones . Yet level ciprofloxacin MIC achieve strain harbor gene without quinolones resistance mechanism associate , remain low . However , ciprofloxacin MICs Escherichia coli lack quinolone resistance mechanism go 0.003 mg / L 0.25 mg / L , depend type qnr . Currently , three type qnr gene describe , encode protein several variant ( qnrA ( n = 6 ) , qnrB ( n = 10 ) qnrS ( n = 2 ) . The qnrA qnrB gene carry plasmid 54-180 kb . Gene environment plasmid DNA class 1 integron Type sul1 call . However sequenced plasmid carry qnrS integron-like structure . These gene common Enterobacteriaceae strain produce ESBL strain others . The low prevalence observe date , increase study . We observe qnr 9 138 ( 6.5 % ) strain isolate Champagne-Ardenne 2004 , include 4 10 strain Enterobacter cloaca . Furthermore show vitro presence qnrA gene facilitate mutant selection high-level quinolone resistance . Therefore , give increase trend prevalence gene report author , necessary establish monitoring identify factor favor emergence strain . The purpose study observe evolution prevalence qnr gene within ESBL-producing strain , detect emergence epidemic clonal strain , look emergence risk factor gene . Given low prevalence gene research involve multicenter study organize 9 East region 's inter hospital 1 April 2008 31 March 2009 . It therefore descriptive study clinicobiological aim : - To collect sufficient number producer strain gene , - To characterize different variant ( CHU Reims ) , - To identify clone possibly associate gene ( Besan√ßon University Hospital ) , - To study genetic environment ( CHU Dijon ) , - Seek clinical factor antibiotic treatment favor presence . All ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates , identify 5 CHU inter region CH 4 , Colmar , Vesoul , Troyes Charleville one year centralize Bacteriology Laboratory University Hospital Reims . The non duplicate isolates include ( one isolate per patient resistance phenotype , specie month ) . 600 ESBL-producing strain expect period among 50 strain carry gene qnr . The clinical study retrospective record . For patient isolate carry qnr , 2 control patient hospital age difference less 10 year `` case '' draw list patient ESBL produce Enterobacteriaceae . And 150 patient record include study . Parallel sequence qnr gene allow precise identification highlight variant . The quinolones MICs determine detect increase level resistance . The rest study include ESBL identification sequence . The study genetic environment qnr perform one isolate gene type specie detect genetic factor promote dissemination ( plasmid , integron ) , variability compare literature data get additional epidemiological marker . Genotyping isolates highlight possible epidemic clone . For Escherichia coli phylogenetic group determine University Hospital Besancon . The distribution E. coli strain . coli carry qnr among different phylogenetic group compare number isolates Escherichia coli drawn among ESBL strain qnr ( 2 control 1 case ) . The major clinical parameter record file , among others , reason hospitalization , main underlying disease , antibiotic treatment isolation ESBL bacteria . It determine strain carry gene qnr statistically resistant certain molecule stem .</detailed_description>
