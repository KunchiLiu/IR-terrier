	<brief_title>The Mindfulness , Incontinence Sexual Function Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate feasibility large multicenter randomize control trial determine impact sexual distress mindfulness-based sex therapy ( MBST ) addition standard urogynecologic care , woman urinary incontinence ( UI ) sexual dysfunction . Hypothesis : The addition MBST standard urogynecologic care reduce sexual distress woman UI sexual dysfunction . Background/Justification : Sexual dysfunction common find woman age 40 seek gynecologic care , 66 % woman report least one complaint , 26 % report sexual distress . This profound negative consequence health relate quality life , interpersonal relationship , stress level , mood . Some study also show prevalence sexual dysfunction increase age , many 80 % elderly woman report dysfunction . In parallel , urinary incontinence , involuntary leakage urine , also increasingly prevalent age , 30-50 % elderly woman affect . Limited evidence suggest treatment urinary incontinence , whether conservative surgical , improve sexual function . Specifically , surgery stress urinary incontinence , 32 % woman show improved sexual function , 55 % see change , 13 % report worsen function . Mindfulness type meditation bring individual 's awareness present moment non-judgmental manner . Since 1970s , mindfulness-based therapy use increasingly treat multiple condition include chronic pain , anxiety , depression , many others . Mindfulness-based sex therapy ( MBST ) show effective manage sexual dysfunction woman arousal disorder , vulvar pain , history gynecological cancer , history sexual abuse . The International Consultation Sexual Medicine , last meeting June 2015 , recommend use mindfulness-based therapy woman low sexual desire . Mechanisms mindfulness believe impact sexual function numerous . First , mindfulness practice produce change brain structure function area involve attention , emotion self-awareness . It also lead improvement mood , decrease stress anxiety , major contributor sexual dysfunction . Second , mindfulness ' emphasis non-judgment help foster acceptance partner . It also reduce self-criticism associate distort body image . Additionally , improved attention sensual stimulus lessen distractibility increase arousal . Research Design : This pilot randomize study woman UI refer Centre Pelvic Floor , St. Paul 's Hospital , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . Recruitment begin obtain ethic approval study . All woman refer Centre Pelvic Floor complete intake questionnaire prior first consultation . That questionnaire include sexual function assessment . Women identify sexual dysfunction distress , baseline questionnaire , invite participate propose study . Potential participant first inform study physician see patient consultation . If patient willing meet research team , research coordinator train medical student explain study , enroll interested woman meet inclusion exclusion criterion , obtain inform consent participate . After complete baseline assessment , participant randomize standard urogynecological care control group , standard care plus mindfulness-based sex therapy ( MBST ) intervention group ( 60 total participant , 30 group ) . Standard urogynecological care UI varies base type UI patient preference , include pelvic floor exercise , pelvic floor physiotherapy , medication bladder function , pessary fitting ( silicone ring place vagina reduce symptom urinary incontinence , well pelvic organ prolapse ) , and/or surgery . Baseline information collect include : participant ' demographic characteristic , pelvic floor dysfunction ( PFD ) urinary incontinence symptom , exam finding , first consultation visit assessment . Further information obtain additional questionnaire body image , mindfulness , anxiety , depression symptom . Women undergo management UI without MBST session . Intervention participant ( undergo MBST session ) re-evaluated questionnaire within 2-4 week intervention . All patient final assessment three month intervention ( include three month post-operatively , allow time resume intercourse initial surgical healing time ) . Data collect patient ' chart urogynecological management ( treatment pelvic floor exercise , pelvic floor physiotherapy , reduction dietary trigger , bladder retraining , medication , incontinence pessary , surgery , etc . ) well response treatment . Throughout process , recruitment rate , research coordinator time , methodological barrier , MBST session attendance , follow-up document . Information gather pilot study inform future multicenter trial . There plan disseminate finding medical community involve woman 's health , well share public large . Statistical Analysis : Descriptive statistic demographic characteristic include . Pre post therapy sexual distress evaluate compare group undergo standard urogynecologic care vs. standard care plus MBST , intention- to-treat analysis . Linear regression post therapy score adjust pre therapy score FSDS-R sexual distress questionnaire perform . Standard deviation around observed difference group contribute sample size calculation future randomize trial . Secondary pilot outcome descriptively assess . Secondary trial outcome compare group use paired t-test , Wilcoxon rank sum test linear regression appropriate . Interaction treatment variable ( i.e. , severity UI symptom baseline , cure UI , PFD symptom ) sexual function assess use linear regression analysis .</detailed_description>
