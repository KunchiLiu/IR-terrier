	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Schizophrenia Patients With Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient underwent medical evaluation include physical examination routine laboratory study repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment . Patients randomly allocate rTMS group sham group . There 20 patient group . For first 20 patient , allocation coin toss . For subsequent 20 patient , allocation accord computer generate random number . The decision enroll patient always make prior randomization . Patients study use double-blind design . Study participant , clinical raters , personnel responsible clinical care patient remain masked allocated condition allocation parameter . Only rTMS administrator access randomization list ; minimal contact patient , role assess AVH . Each patient would treat continuous 15 day rTMS Before rTMS treatment , Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale , Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale obtain trained investigator ass baseline severity auditory verbal hallucination ( AVH ) symptom . The patient receive battery measure neuropsychological test , magnetic resonance image scan multimodalities , electroencephalography ( EEG ) record . After last treatment , Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale , Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale obtain , well Global Index Safety assess adverse event treatment . Patients instructed focus answer past 15 day . The patient also receive battery measure neuropsychological test , magnetic resonance image scan multimodalities , EEG record . A month last treatment , participant interview obtain Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale , Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale , Positive , Negative Syndrome Scale . They instruct focus answer past week . Additionally , also ask assess battery neuropsychological test , magnetic resonance image scan multimodalities , EEG record . Afterwards , unblinded study coordinator .</detailed_description>
