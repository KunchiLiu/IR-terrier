	<brief_summary>The study prospective , multicenter , multinational study assess safety performance Easyx ( trade name ) Antia Liquid Embolic embolization intracranial malformation fistula . The clinical trial include patient already schedule neuroradiological intervention . It estimate 8 site require collect safety performance data study material . Up 65 patient enrol study achieve 53 evaluable patient . Each study centre require treat 5 patient Dural arteriovenous fistula - DAVF treat brain arteriovenous malformation - AVMs brain tumour . Only experienced neuroradiologists invite participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Assess Safety Performance Easyx Antia Liquid Embolic Intracranial Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures Once subject agree participate study sign consent form , baseline visit perform . A full medical history take physical exam do per local routine practice embolization procedure . The Cognard scale perform assess grade DAVF Spetzler Martin grade assess brain AVM treat ; standard score system brain DAVFs AVMs . A neurological exam do abnormality document . Procedure Embolization DAVF BAVM tumor do per routine practice use Easyx product . The procedure treat BAVM tumor may stag complex DAVFs may require second treatment fully occlude fistula . The plan treatment noted procedure visit subsequent plan intervention class adverse event . All intervention 12 month follow visit record Case Report Forms - CRFs . If preliminary angiogram immediately prior treatment show target area longer treat embolic product , patient withdrawn study point alternative treatment per routine practice plan . Procedure detail note feedback treat interventionalist collect , determine ease handle product . If DAVF occlusion complete , assessment occlusion perform note . If DAVF BAVM occlusion blockage supply tumor incomplete , reason incomplete occlusion give . The subject ask complete visual analog scale immediately procedure report pain . A neurological exam do post treatment ass change . Discharge The subject 's condition record discharge . Adverse event report well subsequent image intervention occur follow initial treatment . A neurological exam do change record . The Rankin score do hemorrhagic ischemic stroke ; well know stroke scale . One Month Follow A follow visit do clinic one month initial treatment . Adverse event report subsequent imaging intervention occur follow initial treatment . A neurological exam do change record . The Rankin score do hemorrhagic ischemic stroke . Three - Six Months Follow A control cerebral image do per local routine practice embolization procedure . This may include dynamic Magnetic Resonance MR-Angiography , CT catheter angiography . Adverse event also report . The Cognard score Martin Spetzler grade document neurological exam do . The Rankin score do hemorrhagic ischemic stroke . Twelve Months Follow A final follow visit do 12 month determine adverse event occur . A neurological exam do change record . The Rankin score do hemorrhagic ischemic stroke . Subjects may bring back late 14 month post procedure , fit routine follow . Risks The clinical risk associate use Easyxâ„¢ procedure place device market embolic product . These risk procedure include : - Headache - Too much blood sugar - Infection - Bleeding access point delivery catheter - Bleeding brain blood clot brain lead stroke - Low high blood pressure - Inability get area treat - Difficulty remove delivery catheter , entrapment catheter , rupture catheter - Rupture blood vessel due mishandling catheter due attempt free catheter become stuck embolic agent - Abnormal heart rhythm - A tear wall blood vessel - Respiratory failure - Seizures - Spasm blood vessel - Fainting The specific risk associate delivery embolic product : - Inability clearly see embolized area - Allergic reaction relate placement embolic product - Spasm blood vessel due solvent embolic product - Low platelet count - Reflux migration embolic product - Bleeding event related product delivery - Pain procedure , related product delivery The risk associate delivery system include : - Catheter entrapment - Catheter clog - Catheter rupture The risk associate delivery embolic product incorrect target area : - Damage function cranial nerve vessel - Symptoms stroke associated product wrong brain vessel - Tissue damage surround area embolic product - Incorrect placement venous system Benefits The liquid embolic EasyxTM prove feasible safe endovascular embolization animal AVM hypervascular animal model . The main advantage material even consistency , strongly bound iodine provide high visibility x-ray , non stick property relation delivery catheter adhesive property relation easy placement product target vessel . Also , product ready use need preparation prior placement target vessel . These advantage show Easyx easy use comparison product already market . EasyxTM show biocompatible . The solvent quickly disperse surround tissue allow embolic product quickly precipitate situ provide solid cast target vessel lumen .</detailed_description>
