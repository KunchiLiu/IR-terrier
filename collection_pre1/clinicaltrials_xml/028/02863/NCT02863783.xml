	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pancreas tumor localization make minimally invasive surgical resection pancreas tumor challenge . Recently , endoscopic ultrasound needle system develop enables fiducial coil place precise site biopsy . INTERVENTION : At time EUS guide biopsy fine needle fiducial device use place fiducials tumor . During surgery ass whether improves tumor visualization . OBJECTIVES : We aim determine feasibility use EUS guide fiducials placement mark pancreas tumor 20 patient assess whether fiducials impact tumor visualization pancreas surgery . STUDY POPULATION : Patients pancreas adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine lesion . STUDY ENDPOINTS : The main outcome ass whether coil may successfully place EUS whether impact tumor visualization surgery FOLLOW UP ANALYSIS : Patients assess time EUS surgery . This pilot analysis intention ass feasibility gather data power large trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive pancreatic surgery diminishes morbidity mortality potentially curative procedure . However precise target small adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine tumor challenge . Given safety , precision , ease EUS guide pancreatic fiducial placement emerge favor method mark tumor radiation therapy . The experimental aspect procedure gauge whether EUS guide fiducial placement improve intraoperative assessment pancreas tumor . We use recently introduce ( FDA approve ) Beacon EUS guide fiducial system perform placement . The fiducial alter surgical plan study . However , relative ability detect marker standard pancreatic surgery help inform whether strategy may use improve future approach pancreas surgery . The study prospective trial . All EUS perform part standard clinical care . Conventional EUS+FNA The linear array echoendoscope use identify pancreas adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine tumor . The Beacon EUS system/delivery sheath pass fine needle aspiration perform confirm cytology . This required standard clinical care . The delivery sheath leave place . The cytologist perform bedside interpretation standard clinical care . EUS guide coil injection If adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine tumor confirm fine needle aspiration fine needle fiducial accessory pass delivery sheath ( whose position tumor `` biopsy confirm '' 1-3 fiducials ( coil type ) introduce lesion . This process guide EUS perform standard clinical care . Fluoroscopy utilized . Pancreas Surgery : At time surgery experimental component gauge whether fiducial impact ability assess tumor relative lesion comparable size . Whether fiducial improves improve assessment scale 1-10 scale 5 standard ease detection similarly size tumor ( without fiducials ) base attend surgeon 's experience . However , fiducial use target lesion alter surgical plan . The surgical plan base preoperative clinical imaging , intraoperative finding , intraoperative ultrasound ( standard clinical care ) . The research coordinator present surgery facilitate timely acquisition data . In case patient deem resection candidate time surgery example unexpected metastasis find . The EUS guide fiducial placement bear whether resection do .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients undergo endoscopic ultrasound preoperative evaluation plan pancreatic surgery suspect adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine tumor eligible . Rapid onsite evaluation perform pancreas EUS part standard procedure . In process cytologist examines cell make determination whether aspirate contains malignant benign tissue . Fiducials place cytologic confirmation malignancy site obtain . Tumors size 5mm4cm eligible may benefit mark small tumor give difficulty find intraoperative ultrasound . Moderately large pancreas tumor may also cause fibrosis make identification resection difficult . Coil placement region cytologically confirm malignant cell may helpful . Fiducial marker place initial evaluation ( abdominal compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) indicate resectability . If finding nonresectability ( i.e . liver metastasis ) see EUS fiducials place . 1 ) Patients INR &gt; 1.5 2 ) Platelet county &lt; 100 3 ) Metal allergy 4 ) Pregnant 5 ) &lt; 18 year age 6 ) Patients pancreatic lymphoma also exclude treated chemotherapy .</criteria>
