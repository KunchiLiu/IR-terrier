	<brief_title>A Clinical Assessment Full Range Functional Vision With Three Tecnis Multifocal IOL 1-Piece Models Bilateral Cataract Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , parallel comparison clinical study design two treatment group . One hundred ( 100 ) qualify study patient receive +2.75D ( ZKB00 ) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL dominant eye . Of study patient , 50 patient receive +3.25D ( ZLB00 ) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL non-dominant eye 50 patient receive +4.00D ( ZMB00 ) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL non-dominant eye . study patient undergo routine cataract extraction procedure eye , second eye schedule undergo cataract extraction within 7 30 day first eye . In addition , customary surgeon , study patient receive open-label pre-operative , operative post-operative medication course study period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient bilateral cataract phacoemulsification extraction posterior multifocal IOL implantation plan eye . Male female good general health , 21 year age old time preoperative examination willing surgery second eye within 7 30 day first eye . A patient must willing comply study instruction , agree make office appointment , complete entire course study . A patient visual potential 20/32 good eye cataract removal IOL implantation judgment investigator . A patient preoperative corneal astigmatism ≤ 1.5D eye [ intraoperative management corneal astigmatism permissible , may include arcuate incision ( ) LRI ( ) . ] A patient postoperative astigmatism target ≤ 0.5D eye . A patient clear ocular medium cataract eye . A patient normal OCT macula eye macula judge normal investigator clinical examination . A patient naturally dilate pupil size &gt; 3.5mm , evaluate mesopic illumination . A patient must able read , comprehend willing give HIPAA Informed Consent . A patient know pathology may affect visual acuity ( determined investigator ) ; particularly retinal change affect vision ( macular degeneration , cystoid macular edema , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , etc . ) either eye . A patient amblyopia strabismus . A patient capsular zonular abnormality may affect postoperative centration tilt lens ( e.g . pseudoexfoliation syndrome ) either eye . A patient pupil abnormality ( nonreactive , tonic pupil , abnormally shape pupil , pupil dilate least 3.5mm mesopic/scotopic condition ) either eye . A patient evidence Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy slitlamp examination either eye . A patient evidence keratoconus significant irregular astigmatism preoperative topography either eye . A patient history ocular trauma , ocular surgery either eye . A patient may , expect undergo surgical intervention and/or ocular laser treatment prior study period either eye . A patient refractive surgery ( LASIK , LASEK , RK , PRK , etc . ) prior cataract surgery either eye . A patient history wear PMMA lens within 6 month , gas permeable lens within one month , extend wear daily soft contact lens within seven day schedule surgery . A patient require use systemic ocular medication may affect vision . A patient uncontrolled acute chronic disease illness would increase risk confound study result ( e.g . diabetes , immunocompromised , etc. ) . A patient uncontrolled systemic disease . A potential patient therapy systemic disease yet stabilize consider entry study .
