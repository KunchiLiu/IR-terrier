	<brief_summary>New study reveal high-fat diet could make cell intestinal line likely become cancerous . The investigator would like study obesity influence growth intestinal stem cell , could trigger intestinal tumor . The investigator propose Pilot Study 20 subject ( comprise 10 participant two different BMI category : 20-25 35 &amp; ) , ask provide blood , stool , &amp; urine sample , undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy , complete food frequency questionnaire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defining Role Gut Microbiome Mediating Effects Obesity Intestinal Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The investigator test hypothesis gut microbiome drive many effect pro-obesity high-fat diet intestinal stem cell ( ISC ) biology , include 1 ) increase ISC number proliferation , 2 ) reduce dependency niche cell intestinal organoid initiation , 3 ) acquisition organoid-initiation non-stem cell population intestinal epithelium . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine whether difference gut microbiome obese human subject correlate enhanced intestinal stem cell number function . 2 . To validate whether obesity-driven change gut microbiome human recapitulate effect obesity intestinal stem cell function germ-free mouse .</detailed_description>
