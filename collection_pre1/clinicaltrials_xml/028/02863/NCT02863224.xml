	<brief_summary>Globally primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) affect 60 million people . The exact pathogenesis POAG poorly understood . A significant risk factor glaucoma advance age . The rate age age match individual . The concept accelerate age suggests presence number specific genetic , environmental systemic risk factor may cumulate accelerate age process individual lead development age-related disease . Understanding factor influence accelerate age vital . Advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) complex group compound naturally form . They accumulate gradually age cell , tissue blood vessel throughout body adversely affect structure function . Circulating AGE level influence oxidative stress level dietary intake . Recent research find sustain exposure high level circulate AGEs could major factor development number chronic age-related degenerative disorder , include POAG . To date clinical study able non-invasively explore association AGE level development progression glaucomatous optic neuropathy ( GON ) , explore possible contribution oxidative stress dietary intake make total tissue AGE level patient . Furthermore little understood relationship AGE level retinal vascular function , parameter know alter GON also could influence AGE level . The propose study aim evaluate whether tissue-bound AGE level associate parameter retinal vascular function , oxidative stress , dietary intake presence GON . Establishing association could increase understanding pathogenesis GON allow new biomarker accelerate ocular ageing realise</brief_summary>
