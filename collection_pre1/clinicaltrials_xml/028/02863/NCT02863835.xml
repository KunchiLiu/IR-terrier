	<brief_summary>Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) non-invasive provide functional imaging lung could useful tool diagnose chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( CLAD ) specially Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS ) . Hence , study , investigator aim show EIT would provide accurate diagnostic CLAD ability distinguish BOS Restrictive Allograft Syndrome ( RAS ) stage BOS accurately compare FEV1 current gold standard . The investigator also aim provide physiological data lung transplant recipient chronic rejection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation treatment option available patient affect end-stage lung diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , respond maximal medical therapy . Despite advance surgical technique , immunosuppression treatment prevention acute cellular rejection episode well opportunistic infection , long term outcomes follow lung transplant remain unsatisfactory . Chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( CLAD ) first cause long term mortality lung transplant recipient responsible 5 year mortality post-surgery 50 % . CLAD lead chronic respiratory failure present two different phenotype : Restrictive form CLAD lung volume decrease ( commonly call RAS , Restrictive Allograft Syndrome ) recently associate antibody mediate rejection . A common form obstructive CLAD identify well-known defined Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS ) . In patient BOS , progressive obliteration narrow distal airway result breathlessness , airflow obstruction air trap . Currently , Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) measurement gold standard ass BOS severity . This test non invasive easily perform bedside . Thus , give broad idea regional consequence BOS may influence large airway obstruction . Chest compute tomography ( CT ) give detailed image regional consequence BOS time-consuming expose patient radiation . Others image technique ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy study perform bedside . As date curative treatment BOS , preventive treatment long term azithromycin , bronchodilator , inhaled steroid plasmapheresis start early stage disease improve outcomes recipient Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air ventilator . It allow assessment difference , previously require use invasive equipment obtain . Information gain repeatedly inject small alternate electric current ( usually 5 mA ) high frequency 50 - 80 kHz system skin electrode ( usually 16 ) apply circumferentially around thorax single plane 4th 6th intercostal space . While adjacent pair electrode 'injects ' current ( 'adjacent drive configuration ' ) , remain adjacent passive electrode pair measure difference electric potential . A resistivity ( impedance ) image reconstruct data mathematical algorithm use two dimensional model simplify shape represent thoracic cross-section . The resulting image posse high temporal functional resolution make possible monitor dynamic physiological phenomenon ( e.g . delay regional inflation recruitment ) breath breath basis . It important realize EIT image base image reconstruction technique require least one measurement well-defined reference state . All quantitative data relate reference indirectly quantify ( relative ) change local lung impedance ( absolute ) . EIT use mechanically ventilated patient assess recruitment optimise ventilator setting reduce risk iatrogenic ventilator associate lung injury . To date , EIT never use lung transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
