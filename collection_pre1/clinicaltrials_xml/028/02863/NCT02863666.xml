	<brief_title>Verification Prediction Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel algorithm determine risk acute cardiac complication , include cardiac arrest , patient present ED recently report . Unlike prior risk stratification tool rely basic vital sign data , algorithm utilizes advance compute ECG data solve risk classification problem . Data collect patient present emergency department primary complaint determine cardiopulmonary origin clinician . Verification result previous study use algorithm diverse patient cohort require . As , propose study investigate accuracy algorithm .</detailed_description>
