	<brief_title>Estimation MMP-8 Levels GCF Serum Its Correlation With Wound Healing Clinical Outcomes After Coronally Advanced Flap Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft Root Coverage Recession Defects : A CLINICO-BIOCHEMICAL STUDY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NEED FOR THE STUDY : Coronally advance flap Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft ( CAF+SCTG ) technique proven one successful modality root coverage.1 The success surgical procedure dependent wound heal . Wound heal surgical procedure complex highly orchestrated event include hemostatic phase , inflammatory phase , phase new tissue formation final remodelling phase leave behind collagen rich extracellular matrix ( ECM ) dense stable tissue.2 During wound heal clot provide foundation future ECM . ECM play vital role prompt cellular migration , adhesion , wound contraction epithelialization . This crucial role ECM maintain group enzyme collectively know Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . MMPs play central role wound healing.3,4 Failure regulation MMPs correlate faulty wound healing.3,4 MMPs ( i.e . collagenase , gelatinases , matrilysins , stromelysins , membrane type MMPs ) family zinc dependent endopeptidases capable cleave extracellular matrix ( ECM ) heal wounds.3 MMP-8 primarly produce neutrophil also produce cell oral epithelial cell , plasma cell fibroblasts.7 MMP-8 express myelocytic stage development PMN ( Polymorphonuclear cell ) precursors bone marrow29 store latent enzyme ( pro-mmp-8 ) within specific granule PMN.30 Pro-MMP-8 rapidly release activated PMN undergo degranulation31 activate via cysteine switch mechanism yield active form enzyme.29 MMP-8 ( polymorphonuclear collagenase5 ) cleave triple helix fibrillar collagen affinity type I collagen type III collagen5 abundantly find connective tissue gingiva . MMP-8 degrade gelatin type VII , VIII X collagen.5 MMP-8 implicate important acute wound healing.6 Assessment wound heal progression surgery important . Currently blunt surrogate marker probe use . Limitation marker represent history heal ongoing activity . As hallmark heal collagen remodeling , interest study cytokine profile relates wound heal . Such knowledge may potentially lead new diagnostic strategy study wound heal good way reflect heal phenotype . The function collagenase normal wound heal periodontal surgery relatively ill-defined due lack study area.10 Most research concentrated characterisation MMP-8 pathogenesis periodontal disease8 change MMP-8 level periodontal treatment . Nwomeh et al study MMP-8 dermal wound heal collect wound exudate occlusive bandage . He note MMP-8 peak day 4 persist week . MMP-8 expression lead faulty healing.5 Chronic wound 30 time great MMPs acute wound . Inhibiting excessive protease expression wound may allow prospective wound heal treatment.5 Very less know cellular aspect soft tissue heal oral mucosa . The assumption oral heal similar dermal wound might provoke confusion , certain subtle difference like reduced scar formation dermal wounds2 , role IL-1 oral wound absence IL-1 dermal wounds11 , faster heal oral wound , presence saliva aid heal etc . Overall still matter speculation ambiguity difference unique heal pattern oral wound . Understanding wound heal molecular level provide depth basis develop treatment strategy prevent delayed healing.2 As recommended Consensus Report 10th European workshop periodontology , need study cellular level identify cytokine , chemokine , intracellular signal network well regenerative approaches10 , present clinical trial design .
