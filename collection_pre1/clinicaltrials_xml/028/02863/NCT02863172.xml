To examine variation clinical feature , survival outcome , family history , health behavior among proband patient know suspected hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome 2 . To compare clinical feature , survival outcome , health behavior proband vs. his/her family member may may affect hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome 3 . To explore correlation germline genetic variation probands family member observe variation overall disease phenotype across probands kindred , within give syndrome . Disease phenotype define include : ( 1 ) clinicopathologic feature include patient demographic oncologic outcome ; ( 2 ) clinical manifestation disease include timing , spectrum severity CRC extracolonic cancer . Genetic variation may include specific codon mutate , type mutation sequence alteration , chromosomal/gene copy number change , gene polymorphism . 4 . To explore correlation germline genetic variation probands family member observe variation somatic CRC tumor biology , include tumor pathology tumor molecular marker</brief_summary>
