	<detailed_description>This first study comprehensively analyze data large unselected old AML population US , treat untreated . These data widen understanding treatment decision older AML population shed light impact HMA vulnerable population . The finding study help identify role HMA ( salient feature better tolerability less toxicity ) new treatment paradigm old AML patient enable comparison outcome HMA v `` conventional '' leukemia therapy ( intensive chemotherapy , low dose cytarabine best supportive care ) . Additionally , update SEER-Medicare file carry Medicare claim 2013 , study help analyze several long term outcome measure extend eight year MDS patient treat lenalidomide . Finally , effectiveness HMA SEER-Medicare MDS population study use SEER-Medicare data . This registry include information Medicare MDS beneficiary - population age cohort high incidence rate MDS large sample size absolute MDS case approach 40000 , make large MDS registry world . The overall sample include case MDS AML newly diagnose 2001 2011 claim 2000 2012 . Investigators estimate include approximately 50,000 patients.Therefore , Target Follow Up design look patient record span 12 year . Consists patient myeloid malignancy diagnose 2001-2011 age 66 year older alive September 2004 ( i.e . 3 month FDA approval azacitidine MDS ) , know month diagnosis , identify death certificate autopsy , continuous Medicare Part A B coverage , enrol health maintenance organization period interest . The overall sample include case MDS AML newly diagnose 2001 2011 claim 2000 2012 . Variables interest collect include : MDS subtypes , age diagnosis , sex , race , comorbidities , median household income zip code level , treatment ( include supportive care ) diagnosis AML progression , transfusion status , NCI comorbidity index score , response treatment ( use International Working Group criterion ) , physician characteristic ( speciality data ) , hospital characteristic ( bed size , teach status , case volume ) .</detailed_description>
