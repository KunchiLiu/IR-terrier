	<brief_summary>To date , clinical benefit harm surgical intervention proximal humerus fracture child remain debatable . The practical question raise orthopaedic surgeon : child adolescent , clinical radiological outcome non-operative management equivalent surgical management proximal humerus fracture ? The investigator ' hypothesis due heal potential proximal humerus , outcome fracture usually excellent . The investigator apply Caldicott approval identify cohort eligible patient NHS Tayside 's radiography service . With community health index ( CHI ) number , investigator review shoulder X-rays perform child adolescent , age 10 18-year-old NHS Tayside , 2008 2015 .

	<detailed_description>Proximal humerus fracture child relatively uncommon require surgical treatment due heal potential child . The management proximal humerus fracture child subsequently underwent major change introduction surgical metal rod nailing . Despite , best criterion choose two treatment option still agree upon . To date , clinical benefit harm surgical intervention proximal humerus fracture child remain debatable . The investigator hypothesise outcomes non-operative management proximal humerus fracture remain excellent due heal ability child . If good clinical result achieve patient cohort , investigator would like send message non-operative treatment proximal humerus fracture child recommend , even severely displaced fracture . With Caldicott approval , investigator review X-rays perform child adolescent , age 10 18-year-old NHS Tayside , 2008 2015 . By use Picture Archiving Communication System ( PACS ) , investigator able identify cohort patient proximal humerus fracture X-rays . The Caldicott approval also allow investigator obtain clinical communication Clinical Portal . The identified potential participant approach paediatric orthopaedic team . An invitation letter , participant information sheet questionnaire , base UEFI send potential participant care team via post . If response within 2 week , investigator send 1 reminder .
