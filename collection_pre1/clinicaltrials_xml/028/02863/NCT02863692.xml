	<detailed_description>The frequent primary endpoint phase III trial CLL progression-free survival ( PFS ) . However , important endpoint overall survival ( OS ) usually secondary endpoint trial . The outcome progression critical response second subsequent therapy may differ trial arm . Therefore essential ass OS addition PFS . In addition , late toxicity , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated lymphoproliferative disease Hodgkin 's disease , late opportunistic infection second malignancy , increasingly see likely differ depend intensity therapy . Moreover , meta-analysis several phase III trial long follow-periods desirable . Similarly , valid analysis biological disease characteristic relation outcome depend large collection clinical data mature follow-up . The finding CLL8 study provide evidence addition rituximab chemotherapy Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide ( FC ) may prolong survival patient CLL . However , also open question whether apply therapy might cause certain late toxicity whether improves longterm survival patient CLL . Moreover outcome subsequent therapy various first line treatment Fludarabine ( F ) , FC , Bendamustine Rituximab ( BR ) Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide Rituximab ( FCR ) amongst others outside clinical trial need investigate . Recently publish phase III trial CLL show median observation time range 22 41 month , trial report observation time around 2 year . For phase III trial German CLL Study Group ( GCLLSG ) great effort make implement extend follow trial , due administrative reason follow limited 8 year . This registry enable collection data entire course diseases in- outside clinical trial . Besides CLL relate rare lymphoproliferative malignancy include registry . On one hand historical hand clinical reason diseases close CLL information gather best possible . Only limited information available patient SLL , B-PLL , T-PLL , T/NK-LGL , HCL Richter 's transformation . They carry orphan disease status long-term follow-up data urgently need . To knowledge comparable registry patient CLL , B-PLL , T-PLL , SLL , T/NK-LGL , HCL Richter 's transformation . In order understand gain great insight biology , response treatment outcome rare diseases extremely important gather structure information patient disease centrally .</detailed_description>
