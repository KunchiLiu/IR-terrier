	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION It estimate 80 % woman give vaginal birth sustain form perineal tear 60-70 % require suturing . It great importance operator familiar best suturing technique suture material order minimize possible associate short- long-term sequela . There evidence suture continuously reduce postoperative pain superficial dyspareunia , choice suture-material still debate . The function suture close wound minimize bleeding , risk infection adapt wound edge promote anatomic correct heal . Infection result soften wound edge , shirk suture , pain dehiscence . Delayed and/or compromise wound heal correlate impaired strength affect tissue . Reported frequency infection first second degree tear 1 11 % discrepancy likely due poor registration follow-up . In 2004 Polyglactin 910 launch new antibacterial coating Triclosan ( VicrylPlus® ) . Studies suggest correlation use VicrylPlus® reduction 30 % surgical site infection ( SSI ) compare conventional suture non-colonized wound . OBJEKTIVE : The primary objective compare infection rate pain intensity use Vicryl® versus VicrylPlus® perineal repair delivery . Secondly , show difference insufficient wound heal superficial/deep dyspareunia one year two group . METHODS The participant randomly allocate continuously suture either Vicryl® VicrylPlus® . Sealed identical look envelope prepare placed delivery room ( randomized block 50 , 948 total ) contain randomization number , suture , declaration inform consent questionnaire . The participant instruct fill first questionnaire 7 day second questionnaire 8 week post partum . After 8 week participant offer routine visit `` out-patient clinic '' . After one year internet-based survey send participant . In case complains/signs deficient heal one year woman offer clinical control . Data analyze accord `` intention treat '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison VicrylPlus® Versus Vicryl® Repair Perineal Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS : VicrylPlus® superior Vicryl® term infection rate , delay perineal wound heal short-/longterm perineal discomfort . Methods : Women give birth Skåne University hospital November 23 , 2015 assess eligibility . The hospital consist two labor ward approximately 9.000 delivery pr year . After birth case first , second third degree tear , `` labor-responsible '' midwife doctor prepare patient required suture procedure . The two suture use project new staff , begin study suture available delivery room randomly use dependent midwife's/doctor 's preference . Also , study-start midwifes/doctors carefully instruct detection classification perineal tear correspond suture technique . There evidence suture deep long tear vagina tear perineum continuously educate trained staff suture technique ( e-learning practical training ) . Tears suture mainly midwives case doctor assistance record obstetrical chart . The delivery course , degree laceration , suture-procedure always document electronic obstetrical record accordingly predefined standard ( Obstetrix , Siemens ) . If woman enrol study randomization number incorporate operation description . After identification tear require continuously suture ( stitch ) personal kindly ask woman participate study . The woman introduce reason conduct study question . If agree unable enrollment , midwife un-certified continuously suture , midwife choose suture normally prefers . If woman agree randomly allocate suture either Vicryl® VicrylPlus® , CT-1 , 2/0 gauge draw seal pre-packed identical look envelope whereafter write informed consent obtain . The envelope contain randomization number ( randomized block 50 Randomization.com ) , two packet identical suture , envelope patient questionnaire prepay return envelope . The type suture blind participant possible contact medical staff discharge , suture midwife/doctor carefully instruct disclose origin suture use . If need 2 suture staff bring material sterile depot . Randomization number , woman 's personal number woman 's operator 's signature note write patient consent . The document return lock box . Once week responsible investigator ( Nana Wiberg ) empty box . The randomization number , date inclusion , personal number , telephone number note NW specific study protocol Kristine Lund Sønnichsen ( KLS ) NW access . The informed consent thereafter place locked cabinet . The patient instruct fill questionnaire respectively 7 day 8 week postpartum meantime bring , case clinical control . The questionnaire consist general information sheet woman fill information education , body mass index ( BMI ) , previous actual pregnancy delivery . The sheet consist visual analogue scale ( VAS scale ) , question eventually use painkiller `` signs-of-infection '' question accordingly CDC criterion . The third part use case contact medical staff discharge . All non-respondents contact primarily telephone secondarily send remind letter one investigator ( KLS NW ) questionnaire receive within week expect deadline ( calculated date inclusion ) . When questionnaire receive answer notice together obstetrical data interest study protocol one investigator ( KLS ) . All obstetrical data extract database ( Obstetrix ) . After one year patient ask fill electronic internet base survey case complains/symptoms deficient heal woman invite clinical control . Statistics Calculation The sample size detect 50 % reduction infection estimate prevalence 10 % give 474 participant arm detect difference 80 % power 5 % significance level , two tail . Data analyze accord `` intention treat '' . Continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation , median , range categorical variable number ( percentage ) . For comparison group follow test use ; unpaired t-test continuous normally distribute data , Mann-Whitney U-test continuous skew distribute data χ2 test categorical variable . Frequency data present odds ratio 95 % confidence interval . Spearman 's rank correlation use analyze correlation continuous variable . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The IBM Statistical Package Social Sciences , Windows version 22 use ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) statistical analysis . The CONSORT 2010 Statement meet . An independent steering committee conduct interim analysis 800 inclusion estimate close study . Women need continuously suture include study notice protocol . Women include answer questionnaire consider part trial . A flow chart use visualize study group/exclusions dropout . Ethical aspects The study approve local ethical board , Lund , Sweden ( Dnr 2015/10 ) . Sideeffects There reason believe study inflict harm side effect participant operator . Triclosan approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) report evidence side effect include allergic reaction induction antibiotic resistance .</detailed_description>
