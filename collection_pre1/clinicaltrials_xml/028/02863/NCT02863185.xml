	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high risk death cardiac disease major cause death . CKD patient commonly traditional risk factor coronary artery disease , age , gender , hypertension , cigarette smoking , dyslipidemia . Previous study report reduce cholesterol level associate reduce morbidity mortality atherosclerosis . In particular , pharmacologic treatment use statin decrease risk adverse cardiovascular event CKD population . Therefore , guideline recommend use statin CKD patient . On hand , niacin fibrates recommend concomitantly statins patient CKD increase risk adverse event . In addition , recent study report incremental clinical benefit addition niacin statin therapy , decrease incidence major cardiac event . Supplementation omega-3 fatty acid ( FA ) lower risk cardiovascular death patient myocardial infarction . This cardioprotective effect omega-3 FA explain anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative , anti-thrombic effect . In addition , omega-3 FA modulates cell membrane receptor affect signal transduction eicosanoid metabolism . The erythrocyte membrane content FA show correlate FA content myocardium . The risk cardiovascular disease significantly reduce patient high omega-3 FA , eicosapentanoic acid docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , erythrocyte membrane . In contrast , high level erythrocyte membrane total trans-FA , trans-oleic acid , arachidonic acid ( AA ) associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated FA ( MUFA ) content , include oleic acid , significantly high patient acute coronary syndrome control subject . The erythrocyte membrane oleic acid content also high dialysis patient high risk cardiovascular disease compare control subject . Therefore , modification erythrocyte membrane FA content important respect cardiovascular disease . In previous study , erythrocyte membrane omega-3 FA show increase MUFA content decrease omega-3 FA supplementation HD patient . However , report effect statin erythrocyte membrane FA composition CKD . Recent study report pitavastatin 4mg decreased DHA AA ratio , pravastatin 20 mg change DHA AA ratio patient CAD . Statin may important role modulation erythrocyte membrane FA . In study , investigator hypothesize pitavastatin supplementation modify erythrocyte membrane FA content , include MUFA oleic acid , CKD patient . In addition , investigator evaluate effect pitavastatin adiponectin glucose level CKD patient .</brief_summary>
