	<detailed_description>The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease increase associate obesity , diabetes hyperlipidemia recent year . Aerobic exercise indeed reduces adipose , hepatic insulin resistance hepatic fat . However , diaphragmatic breathing improve cardiopulmonary function , oxygen content body therefore reduce inflammation cell . The aim study ameliorate hepatic inflammation use diaphragmatic breathing exercise instead aerobic exercise reduce fat liver inflammation . The project intend accomplish within three year ideal exercise leave uncertain question cure non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Hence , literature empirical data analysis review identify strength patient ' motion duration , carry pilot observational study include 20 patient , teach diaphragmatic breathing exercise first year project . Observe initial correlation measurement , variable follow one month three month . For second year , develop train diaphragmatic breathing process assist device ( Diaphragmatic breathing-facilitated exercise device ) . Use diaphragmatic breathing exercise assist device 12-week program diaphragmatic breathing randomize clinical trial , verify impact item intervention patient ' metabolism indicator final year.The project include people 20 year old without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Taking liver function , body mass index , thickness subcutaneous fat , heart rate variability , metabolism indicator mainly study measured variable . Regression Analysis help understand correlation breathe exercise indicator related disease . With intervention diaphragmatic breathing assist device , program extension two-factor analysis variance ( two-way ANOVA ) result verification . The study result provide reference clinician , thereby improve prognosis non-alcoholic fatty liver disease people .</detailed_description>
