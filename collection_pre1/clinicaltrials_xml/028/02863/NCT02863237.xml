	<detailed_description>In general intensive care unit ( ICU ) , 20 % patient ventilate neurological illness . This proportion might much high brain injured patient . As general intensive care patient , brain injured patient predispose number complication associate mechanical ventilation . Both unnecessarily delaying premature attempt withdrawal mechanical ventilation increase rate complication , prolong mechanical ventilation , length stay , motility , cost . Numerous study examine factor predict combine liberation/extubation outcome , include vital capacity ( VC ) , minute ventilation ( VE ) , maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , airway pressure develop 100 m begin inspiration occlude airway ( P0.1 ) , breathe pattern variability ( BPV ) , `` rapid shallow breathe index '' ( RSBI , Breathing frequency-tidal volume ratio , f/Vt ) . The introduction Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist ( NAVA ) make available standardized validate method monitor measure diaphragm electrical activity ( EAdi ) conventional mode ventilation spontaneous breathe trail ( SBT ) . Neuroventilatory efficiency index ( NVE , Tidal volume - EAdi ratio , Vt/EAdi ) neuromechanical efficiency index ( NME , tidal volume - EAdi ratio , Paw/EAdi ) also propose show promising prospect . However , physiological mechanical parameter either limitation use brain injured patient , yet prove validity even poor predictive ability . In part respiratory failure brain injured patient result two principle etiologic entity : primary pulmonary dysfunction neurogenic pulmonary dysfunction . The latter brings u quite different character brain injury patient , require specially consideration . Another reason , patient brain injured indication mechanical ventilation constitute group need ventilatory support artificial airway might separate . Previous study , neurosurgical patient pass SBT , median 2 day elapse attempted extubation , 45 % patient suffer reintubation tracheostomy . Nonetheless , study , disconnection ventilatory support extubation often lump together . Although study investigate factor predictive successful extubation , study consider solely liberation mechanical ventilation . Therefore , present study , investigator separate liberation ventilatory support standalone part traditional weaning/extubation process . Patients divide two group : wean success weaning failure , without consideration artificial airway status . The primary aim study : ) validate EAdi derive value , b ) evaluate traditional predictive parameter wean prediction brain injured patient .</detailed_description>
