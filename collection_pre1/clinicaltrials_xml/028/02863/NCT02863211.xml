	<detailed_description>Every seven minute Canada , death due heart disease stroke . Up 80 % cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) could prevent identify control biological risk factor hypertension , high cholesterol , diabetes , behavioral risk factor physical inactivity , unhealthy diet , smoke . Efforts identify individual high risk adverse cardiovascular event , Framingham Disease Risk ( FDR ) score , focus traditional risk factor , age , gender , smoke status , blood pressure , cholesterol . While approach estimate 10-year risk heart attacks,3 remain suboptimal assess well individual 's cardiovascular system function . In fact , previous study suggest 80 % female evaluate FDR identify low risk , qualify medication know low cardiovascular risk experience myocardial infarction . Therefore , data warrant use cardiovascular screening approach accurate identify risk adverse cardiovascular outcome . There common perception CVD 'man 's disease ' ; however , woman tend develop heart disease approximately 10-15 year later men , prevalence rate similar sex ≥ 60 year age . Heart disease lead cause death woman worldwide . Women often under-represented cardiovascular clinical trial , issue clinical presentation prognosis cardiovascular disease differs men . In fact , woman suffer acute MI likely die , increase risk repeat MI , develop heart failure , consequentially suffer sudden cardiac death , compare men . Although improvement CVD management lead decreased mortality rate , woman men die cause relate CVD since 1980 . It also important highlight traditional risk factor assess FDR score underestimate risk experience adverse cardiovascular event woman , compare men . Thus , appear need develop innovative screening tool well detect early stage CVD risk amongst woman . The Heart Attack Prevention Program You ( HAPPY Hearts ) cardiovascular screen program design screen cardiovascular risk woman . It adapt 4-Test Rasmussen cardiovascular screening program , develop Dr. Jay Cohn Center Cardiovascular Disease Prevention , University Minnesota . The 4-test screening approach utilizes non-invasive procedure measure structural functional change large small artery , include elasticity artery wall blood pressure rest response 3-min moderate intensity exercise . Tests score 0-2 ( 0 = normal ; 1 = borderline ; 2 = abnormal ) total RDS range 0-8 . Each participant categorize base risk ( i.e . 0-2 = normal ; 3-8 = abnormal ) . These simple , non-invasive procedure aim detect early stage CVD individual asymptomatic patient . However , test yet available primary care set use Canadian clinical context . Moreover , know screen approach protocol feasible sufficient predictive value within context Canadian health care system , health service Canada generally deliver private sector fund payment provincial health insurance . The comprehensive 10-test Rasmussen Disease Score ( RDS ) , use , addition 4-test approach , optic fundus imaging , rest electrocardiogram , ultrasound leave ventricle abdominal aorta , microalbumin , brain natriuretic peptide , good FDR identify individual risk experience adverse cardiovascular event within 3-5 years.10 However , unknown whether 4-test RDS ( hereon refer HAPPY Hearts protocol ) good predictor future cardiac event FDR woman . It also unknown HAPPY Hearts screen protocol predict future adverse cardiovascular event woman . This prospective , observational study aim : 1 ) determine HAPPY Hearts cardiovascular screen protocol identifies middle-aged old woman elevate risk experience adverse cardiovascular outcome within five-year period screening ; , 2 ) compare sensitivity specificity value HAPPY Hearts protocol FDR predict future adverse cardiovascular outcome woman . The investigator hypothesize HAPPY Hearts protocol provide good diagnostic accuracy identify middle-aged old woman elevate risk experience adverse cardiovascular outcome five year period post-screening , compare FDR . The HAPPY Hearts Protocol After patient enrollment consent , HAPPY Hearts protocol require participant attend one appointment , schedule approximately 90 minute . The HAPPY Hearts protocol involve four measurement , follow : 1 ) rest blood pressure ; 2 ) systolic blood pressure response 3-min moderate intensity exercise ; 3 ) large artery elasticity assessment ; 4 ) small artery elasticity assessment . For measurement , HD/PulseWave™ CR-2000 Research CardioVascular Profiling System ( CV profiler ) use . This device indicate use determine cardiovascular parameter human subject research purpose . Research staff train use HD/PulseWave™ CR-2000 Research CardioVascular Profiling System perform test . Below measure involve HAPPY Hearts protocol describe . Test 1 : Resting blood pressure A blood pressure cuff attach CV profiler place participant 's arm supine position . A rest blood pressure le 120/80 mmHg consider normal ( 0 RDS point ) , 120-139/80-89 consider pre-hypertensive ( 1 RDS point ) potential development high blood pressure ( hypertension ) . Blood pressure great 140/90 consider abnormal adult ( 2 RDS point ) . Test 2 : Systolic blood pressure response exercise The magnitude rise blood pressure exercise may indication early risk develop hypertension , even participant 's rest blood pressure normal . After rest blood pressure assess , participant ask perform 3 minute moderate exercise 2-step stool accord Dundee Step Test , treadmill unable perform step test . Both exercise procedure perform 5 metabolic equivalent ( MET ) workload . The participant blood pressure measure supine position immediately follow exercise protocol . A rise systolic blood pressure 30 mmHg less 169 mmHg absolute blood pressure consider normal ( 0 RDS point ) , rise 30-39 mmHg absolute rest blood pressure 170-179 consider borderline ( 1 RDS point ) , rise 40 mmHg absolute rest blood pressure 180 mmHg high consider abnormal ( 2 RDS point ) . Test 3 4 : Large small artery elasticity To measure artery elasticity wrist stabilizer place participant 's wrist supine position . A piezoelectric transducer , pulse wave sensor , place location strong pulsation radial artery adjacent styloid process . The CV Profiler assess diastolic decay waveform transmit sensor . Based modified Windkessel model , instrument determine small artery large artery elasticity . Measures instrument show reproducible , one study find intra-visit measurement five minute apart differ 3 % inter-visit measure one four week later differ 4 % . Scoring normal , borderline abnormal result large small arterial elasticity base age gender cutoff . Scoring HAPPY Hearts protocol Each test 4-test RDS score 0 normal , 1 borderline abnormal , 2 abnormal10 . Total score range 0 8 use stratify individual one two risk group : 0-2 = normal risk ; ≥ 3 = moderate high ( abnormal ) risk . Assessment Framingham Risk Score FDR determine base calculation describe D'Agostino et al . Information require calculation acquire participant questionnaire , fast blood sample high density lipoprotein total cholesterol , rest blood pressure read CV Profiler . Participants ask fast 12 hour prior blood draw appointment . Approximately 10 mL blood collect phlebotomist . The sample centrifuge plasma separate analyzed total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein , triglyceride , fast glucose . Exploratory test A battery additional validate cardiovascular related testing conduct addition previously mention test . Exploratory statistical analysis examine different combination test result combine rest blood pressure , exercise blood pressure response arterial elasticity result attempt improve sensitivity specificity HAPPY Hearts screen protocol . Questionnaires Participants instruct fill series questionnaire : 1. physical activity behaviour assess use International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) short-version . This questionnaire measure amount intensity physical activity complete individual ; 2. Cardiovascular Health Ambulatory Care Research Team ( CANHEART ) Health Index use assess cardiovascular health behavior disease risk base physical activity ( IPAQ short-version ) , smoke status , fruit vegetable consumption , body mass index , well ass presence diabetes high blood pressure ; 3. stage change health behavior stag change specifically related physical activity assess use Transtheoretical Model Change Physical Activity Stages Change questionnaires , respectively ; 4. quality life assess use EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level quesionnaire ; 5. presence severity depressive symptom assess use Patient Health Questionnaire-9 . Fried Frailty Phenotype A phenotype frailty assess use Modified Fried Criteria previously describe Fried et al . Briefly , Fried score classifies participant frail three follow criterion meet : 1 ) unintentional weight loss ; 2 ) self-reported exhaustion ; 3 ) weakness ; 4 ) slow walk speed ; 5 ) low physical activity . Exhaustion assess Center Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale . Physical activity level assess Paffenbarger Physical Activity Scale23 . Unintentional weight loss determine via questionnaire , weakness slow walk speed assess use grip strength dynamometer five meter gait speed test , respectively . 6- Minute Walk Test Participants instruct walk many length 30 meter track possible 6 minute duration . Distance cover test record . A study Beatty et al . show prognostic value 6MWT predict cardiovascular event patient stable coronary heart disease . Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes - 5-year follow-up Upon completion HAPPY Hearts Protocol , individual 's Personal Health Information Number ( PHIN ) utilize follow study participant determine experienced adverse cardiovascular outcome , define Table 2 , use Manitoba Centre Health Policy ( MCHP ) Population Health Research Data Repository . This linkage do Manitoba Health , provide MCHP correct scramble identifier need follow-up participant . MCHP data access number different database . Hospital separation abstract , medical claim Drug Program Information Network examine provide information hospitalization cardiac disease , cardiac procedure perform , cardiac-related medication use , diagnose cardiac disease . This information help examine diagnostic accuracy RDS versus FDR . Vital statistic also provide information cause death allow mortality rate tracking . This administrative health data use compare adverse cardiovascular event HAPPY Hearts protocol result determine cardiovascular screen approach predict individual moderate high risk adverse cardiovascular outcome five-year period screening . The investigator ' rationale access follow-up health information Repository MCHP obtain accurate information healthcare service utilization , adverse cardiovascular event , demographic , etc . This method much simpler , complete less invasive repeat contact participant . Statistical analysis Based publish data , investigator predict 36 % screen population ( i.e . 360 1000 participant ) abnormal outcome base Happy Hearts Protocol ( i.e . score 3 great ) . This data indicate approximately 7.7 % ( i.e . 28 360 participant ) people abnormal score experience adverse cardiovascular outcome 5-year period . Kaplan-Meier method Receiver Operating Characteristic curve conduct estimate cumulative rate adverse outcome compare sensitivity specificity HAPPY Hearts protocol FDR score , respectively . A Cox Proportional Hazards model conduct , control covariates identify univariate analysis , age , could predictive adverse cardiovascular outcome .</detailed_description>
