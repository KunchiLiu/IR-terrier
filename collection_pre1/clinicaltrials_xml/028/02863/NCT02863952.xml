	<detailed_description>Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) well-established noninvasive procedure evaluation risk stratification patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . However , recognize certain patient SPECT MPI unable detect presence CAD underestimate extent . The fact moderate severe perfusion defect note less half patient significant leave main disease stimulate study improve diagnostic accuracy SPECT MPI . These study analyze post-stress parameter leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction ( EF ) , wall motion abnormality transient LV dilation . However , parameter derive data acquire use conventional Anger camera long 60 minute stress tracer injection . Such delayed assessment may miss early ischemic stun result rapid transient change . However , highly sensitive detector short live tracer , ability PET MPI measure EF peak stress report . Similarly , novel cadmium-zinc-telluride ( CZT ) SPECT cameras solid state cardiac-focused detector significantly sensitive conventional Anger scintillation camera give SPECT `` PET-like '' ability image rapidly right stress test . The aim study evaluate early post-stress EF change ( ∆EF ) relation severity myocardial ischemia angiographic coronary disease use CZT-SPECT MPI .</detailed_description>
