	<detailed_description>The 300,000 chronically critically ill patient year require prolonged mechanical ventilation ( PMV ) 1,2 represent ever-growing , extremely vulnerable , proportion intensive care unit ( ICU ) survivors.3 The increase number patient important factor expand use long-term acute care hospital ( LTACHs ) , center specialize mechanical ventilation wean rehabilitation . The 412 LTACHs currently operate United States admit 130,000 patient annually account $ 5 billion Medicare expenditures year.4,5 Unfortunately , LTACH stay patient require PMV typically complicate associated number poor outcome include high one-year mortality rate ( 44-77 % ) ,6,7 severe endure brain dysfunction ( i.e. , coma and/or delirium ) , life-altering functional decline , substantial pain suffering , caregiver burden diminish quality life.6-11 While return home often important goal patient families,3 rare outcome population.11 Rather , patient require PMV often experience multiple transition care year follow original hospital admission ( median 4 ) , result cost persistent , profound disability.9 Despite dishearten finding , date limit scientific evidence available help clinician care chronically critically ill , particularly require PMV LTACHs . Chronically critically ill patient generally old , sick comorbidities acutely ill counterparts.12 Importantly , also suffer much great symptom burden , 90 % patient experience least one distress symptom course illness ( e.g. , pain , dyspnea , weakness ) .13 While symptom often think unfortunate inevitable consequence critical illness,14 evidence suggest inappropriate management symptom may actually causal poor outcome experience group.15 For example , result numerous , well-designed , clinical trial conduct traditional ICU set team others suggest regular pain , agitation , delirium assessment , prevention treatment , couple strategy decrease patient ' exposure sedative medication , support early mobilization , promote evidence-based mechanical ventilation discontinuation approach , actively engage empower family member patient care positively affect important patient-centered outcome ( e.g. , improve survival physical/cognitive ability ) .16-26 One unifying method implement evidence base intervention everyday practice consistent reliable use ABCDEF bundle ( i.e. , Assess , prevent , manage pain , Both Spontaneous Awakening Trials ( SATs ) &amp; Spontaneous Breathing Trials ( SBTs ) , Choice analgesia sedation , Delirium ass , prevent , manage , Early mobility exercise , Family engagement empowerment ) .27 Congruent Society Critical Care Medicine 's Clinical Practice Guidelines Management Pain , Agitation , Delirium endorse number patient safety quality organization include Institute Healthcare Improvement Gordon Betty Moore Foundation , ABCDEF bundle actively implement ICUs throughout world . The strength evidence support ABCDEF bundle , couple strong implementation momentum , prompt interest LTACH apply bundle everyday care chronically critically ill patient require mechanical ventilation . Select Specialty , national network 100 LTACHs across United States , express desire adopt ABCDEF bundle `` standard care '' patient . As part initiative , Select first plan conduct ABCDEF bundle quality improvement project one local hospital . The overall purpose before-after study study prospectively process effect implement ABCDEF bundle everyday care patient require prolonged mechanical ventilation LTACH setting . Specifically study 's aim : Aim 1 : Identify facilitator barrier successful ABCDEF bundle implementation LTACH setting . Aim 2 : Compare symptom experience ( e.g. , pain , agitation , anxiety , fatigue , shortness breath , restlessness , sadness , hunger , fear , thirst , confusion sedative medication exposure ) patient receive usual LTACH care ( month 1-4.5 ) treat ABCDEF bundle ( month 4.5-9 ) . Aim 3 . Evaluate impact ABCDEF bundle implementation safety ( i.e. , new pneumonia , device self-removal ) patient-centered outcome ( i.e. , delirium/coma free day , wean duration , tracheostomy removal , mortality , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , functional cognitive ability , discharge disposition , opioid benzodiazepine withdrawal rate , quality life ) patient receive usual LTACH care ( month 1-4.5 ) treat ABCDEF bundle ( month 4.5-9 ) . To complete aim investigator administer on-line survey conduct focus group interview LTACH staff ABCDEF bundle implement everyday care . Over course nine month period , investigator also consent enroll 81 patient require mechanical ventilation time LTACH admission . These patient undergo daily , in-person symptom assessment use valid reliable screening tool . Finally , medical record review brief patient interview conduct obtain data outcomes interest .</detailed_description>
