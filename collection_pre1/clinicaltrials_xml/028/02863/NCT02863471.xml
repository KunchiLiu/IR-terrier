	<brief_title>Open-label Pilot Phase I / II Study Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) After Macroscopically</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite medical progress recent year pancreatic reach 5-year survival rate even radical surgical resection 20 % , due high rate local recurrence distant metastasis postoperative course . Due anatomical position pancreas resections `` wide margin '' technically almost impossible , tumor postoperative preparation often marginal forming . A possible explanation high number local recurrence , intraoperative tumor cell displacement question . In patient peritoneal metastasis colorectal cancer could radical removal tumor focus significantly improve survival compare sole systemic chemotherapy additionally achieve hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) . Purpose HIPEC kill remain microscopic residual tumor residual tumor cell free . The aim present phase I / II study therefore examine importance HIPEC addition radical resection ductal pancreatic cancer term mortality morbidity .</detailed_description>
