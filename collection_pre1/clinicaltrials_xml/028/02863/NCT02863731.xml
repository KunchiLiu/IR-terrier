	<brief_summary>Prolonged sit risk factor cardiovascular musculoskeletal disease , diabetes , several type cancer all-cause mortality . In combination static awkward posture , prevalence musculoskeletal diseases increase . Although implementation sit-to-stand active workstation help reduce sit time , improve physical activity work promote health benefit , might also lead change cognitive function productivity . The purpose study evaluate short-term effect alternate work posture cognitive performance healthy people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Measurements make laboratory . They make two different day interval 7 day session . Laboratory test conduct control , simulate work-space locate University Applied Sciences Campus Linz . All laboratory measurement make control laboratory campus site Linz University Applied Sciences Upper Austria . Temperature , air flow , humidity , light condition ( artificial light ) noise level control set consistent subject ' typical work environment . During laboratory measurement , subject either stand sat upright ergonomic office chair , accord study protocol . Subjects encourage work fast accurately could . To ensure identical test condition subject unduly influence physiological parameter heart rate variability ( HRV ) , subject require minimize excessive movement ( e.g . stand sit period ) . In first ( initial ) phase participant familiarize study protocol . Sitting time weekly physical activity determine via long version International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ , first day measurement ) . Examples cognitive test implement cognitive phase execute accord guideline . A 30 minute break sit posture use ascertain baseline heart-rate level . Baseline heart-rate calculate 20 minute rest 5 minute interval . In second ( cognitive ) phase subject participate test battery contain five block . Each block consist work speed test ( text edit task ) , attentional test ( d2R-test attention ) reaction time test ( Stroop-test ) . These test last 30 minute fulfill recommendation regard postural change . To simulate `` common '' work condition ( computer base non-computer base task ) , digital ( text editing task , Stroop-test ) well pen &amp; paper ( d2R-test ) version implement test use . For intervention group , cognitive block execute alternate posture ( sit - stand - sit - stand - sit ) either first second day measurement ( cross-over design ) . To generate control period , procedure execute sit posture ( sit - sit - sit - sit - sit ) non-interventional day . For control group , day measurement execute sit posture ( sit - sit - sit - sit - sit ) . In third ( final ) phase participant ask estimate workload mean Task Load Index questionnaire develop National Aeronautics Space Administration ( NASA-TLX ) , follow 30 minute rest phase sit posture . During 30 min rest phase ( initial &amp; final ) participant watch documentary encourage talk . Heart-rate trunk movement measure start study protocol next morning mean mobile ECG-recorder .</detailed_description>
