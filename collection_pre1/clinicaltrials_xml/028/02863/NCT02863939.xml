	<detailed_description>Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) well-established noninvasive procedure evaluation risk stratification patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( 1 ) . However , recognize certain patient SPECT MPI unable detect presence underestimate extent CAD . The fact moderate severe perfusion defect note less half patient significant leave main disease ( 2 ) stimulate study improve diagnostic accuracy SPECT MPI . Such study analyze post-stress parameter leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction ( EF ) ( 3 , 4 ) , wall motion abnormality ( 5 ) transient LV dilation ( 6 ) image acquire conventional Anger camera long 60 minute stress tracer injection . Such delayed assessment may miss early ischemic stun result transient nature . However , detection early post-stress decrease cardiac output ( CO ) may serve potential marker presence significant extensive ischemia . The aim study test early post-stress CO change impedance cardiography relation severity extent myocardial ischemia angiographic coronary disease subject undergoing exercise stress test use novel cadmium-zinc-telluride ( CZT ) SPECT camera .</detailed_description>
