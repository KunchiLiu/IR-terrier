	<brief_summary>Introduction : Hip motor control deficit neuromuscular disorder gluteus medius influence mechanic patellofemoral joint increase dynamic knee valgus lead Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFPS ) . Mechanoreceptors stimulate elastic tape , sends desire tactile cue via afferent improve functional support musculoskeletal system . Objective : To analyze response hip stabilizer muscle activation street runner PFPS application elastic tape therapy . Methods : The investigator evaluate street runner age 18 45 , run least 5km/week suffer pain least 3 month . The volunteer assess relation measurement , experience pain training routine , medius muscle ( GM ) biceps femoris muscle ( BF ) also test surface electromyography pre-determined performance test . The participant group wear bandage 6 week ( 1 per week ) . However participant placebo group investigator apply different anatomical path without tension , eliminate therapeutic element . The volunteer reassess follow trial . Hypothesis : Expected observe elastic tape therapy result improvement activation hip muscle improvement pain street runner patellofemoral pain syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activation Hip Muscles Runners With Patellofemoral Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will recruit individual 18-45 year age , least running frequency 5 km/week history pain knee least three month two follow listed activity : stair , squat , kneel , jump , long time sit pain palpation lateral side / medial patella . Will include individual without cardiovascular disease , undergone surgery low limb last two year without back pain without injury hip knee . They exclude present allergy use elastic bandage remain use stipulated period . Participants sign inform consent inform , prior start collection . Data collection develop electromyography ( EMG ) muscle data questionnaire participant blind examiner initially hold . The questionnaire consist Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . For EMG gluteus medius ( GM ) biceps femoris ( BF ) , electrode position accord protocol Surface Electromyography Non-Invasive Assessment Muscles ( SENIAM ) , reference electrode locate anterior tibial tuberosity . The application site prepared abrasion cleanse skin 70 % alcohol trichotomy . The maneuver maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) train previously perform collection , five second support normalization data gluteus medius biceps . Among MVICs every muscle hold minute 's rest . The muscle activity record exercise express percentage MVIC . After maneuver MVIC , individual rest five minute immediately start acquisition electromyographic data functional test . For , individual previously guide trained realize . During test , barefoot athlete position one foot leg intense pain complaint , contralateral leg approximately 70 ° knee flexion , relaxed upper body next body , torso upright keep focused look mark affixed wall eye level . In first test , prompt squat ( AG ) approximately 45 ° knee flexion , one foot ; second test , squat held , follow maximum external rotation ( ROT-AG ) hip support . The cadence movement standardize guide appraiser start complete 10 second . Functional test design simulate action hip muscle race support phase motor control low limb . After electromyographic review , hold randomization control group treatment opaque seal envelope , blind evaluator . Individuals group submit application bandage leg pain complaint . For , qualify professional trained bandage application relation anatomical landmark elastic tension application , without knowledge , physiology function thereof . Will use two technique intervention group . For placebo group , application bandage follow different anatomical path without tension , eliminate therapeutic process element . The group follow six week guide keep daily routine . Each week , individual remain five day application bandage , two day without , avoid possible adverse effect excessive constant use . After , new bandage apply trained professional , follow protocol already mention . After six week , volunteer return reevaluation .</detailed_description>
