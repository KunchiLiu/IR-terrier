	<brief_summary>While well accept low level RONS production necessary maintain physiological function , much formation RONS believe participate biomolecules damage . Damage lipid , protein DNA/RNA , cellular tissue level , consequence oxidative stress link number serious disease , include cancer , cardiovascular disease ( CVDs ) hypertension atherosclerosis , neurodegenerative disease Parkinson 's disease Alzheimer 's dementia , diabetes process age . The dietary intake antioxidant think play major role oxidative stress network . Many epidemiologic study report inverse association vegetable fruit consumption reduce risk chronic disease , especially cancer CVDs . However , although many clinical trial conduct vitamin ( E , C combination ) vivo protective effect remain uncertain . Therefore possibility complex mixture phytochemical food may contribute protect effect raise . In concept , possible multiple compound act complimentary synergistic mechanism present great biologic effect achieve individual component To investigate hypothesis , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial conduct order investigate effect multi-micronutrient supplement oxidative stress apparently healthy adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , block randomize , parallel-arm , placebo-controlled , eight-week study . Initially 77 apparently healthy volunteer recruit participate study . 62 volunteer enrol study assign either MM group ( n = 32 ) placebo group ( n = 30 ) use stratify randomization guarantee comparability age , sex BMI distribution two group . The randomization code prepared staff member involve run trial , use computer-generated random number . At initiation study , subject receive 5 bottle ( 0.5L ) MM placebo , make indistinguishable identical packaging . At 4 week subject receive 5 bottle . The subject ask consume 80mL per day , preferably meal . The dose chosen base commercially recommended level . At visit , remain volume supplement count research coordinator .
