	<detailed_description>Background study The respiratory rate ( RR ) important vital sign monitor emergency room , sensitive predictor risk critical illness . An increased RR sensitive independent marker increase mortality patient community acquire pneumonia unselected patient present emergency department ( ED ) : This RR component many risk score prediction adverse outcome , 'Confusion/Urea/Respiratory rate/Blood pressure/-Age 65 old ' ( CURB-65 ) score , Modified Early Warning Score ( MEWS ) , Trauma Score , Revised Trauma Score , APACHE II ( Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation ) PRISM ( Paediatric Risk Mortality ) . Additionally , part Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) Sepsis-definition definition wean patient ventilator ( RSBI , Rapid Shallow Breathing Index , ) . In case , measurement oxygen saturation sufficient tachypnoea may always connection hypoxia . Hence , RR play important role triage patient present emergency room . Especially tachypnoea brings need detailed monitoring investigation . Tachypnea/Bradypnoea see red flag may indicate big variety disease like heart failure , pneumonia , metabolic disturbance pulmonary embolism . Recent study could demonstrate also trend RR reliable predictor clinical outcome . Especially increase tachypnoea hospitalisation associate high mortality A careful exact measurement essential . In emergency situation RR one component Emergency Severity Index ( ESI ) algorithm mandatory vital sign measure decision point `` D '' . However , measurement often omit due time constraint . Moreover document pathologic RR ER scenario indicate hypoxia often neglect leading fatal event contribute death cause medical error . According recommendation World Health Organization ( WHO ) RR measure count breaths period 1 minute count many time chest rise . This do patient rest . This appear impractical due time consumption workload nursing staff emergency department . Studies show fact main reason RR often record critical situation might miss . A prospective study Lovett et al . demonstrate measurement RR nursing staff even impedance plethysmography common use device low sensitivity detect brady- tachypnoea . The vital sign measurement may also differ accord observer variability . The approach use mobile device RR measurement show encouraging result improve efficiency comparison traditional method though field use mobile device still experimental stadium . The investigator aim compare result give camera-based measurement result give capnography . The goal survey analyse accuracy measurement perform software . The investigator recruit healthy volunteer without history pulmonary disease analysis RR monitoring . Upon agreement investigator measure RR camera-based device simultaneously count RR capnography reference method . The data collect standardised protocol archive Access ( R ) database . Different setting ( e.g . supine v sit ) assess . Results depict Bland-Altmann plot . In first step investigator plan feasibility study , , second step , continue measure RR different position situation simulate situation similar emergency condition .</detailed_description>
