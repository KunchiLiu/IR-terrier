	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death globally , dyslipidemias , oxidative stress , sedentary lifestyle obesity primary risk factor . As way reduce cardiovascular disease risk factor , intake antioxidant come fruit vegetable-rich diet nutritional supplement , propose ; sense , cyanobacterium Spirulina maxima important source antioxidant , currently associate cardiovascular protection property . Furthermore , physical exercise moderate intensity protective effect exert cardiovascular disease risk , mainly due physiological adaptation , include expression antioxidant enzyme , stop formation propagation radical , improve redox status organism . There evidence Spirulina maximum , addition exercise , decrease cardiovascular disease risk , mainly observe animal model . However , study humans Spirulina maximum exercise experimental design prove benefit report . Therefore study analyze independent synergistic effect intake Spirulina maximum program physical exercise moderate intensity general fitness , plasma lipid profile antioxidant capacity overweight obese subject . Methods/design : Through randomize , double blind , placebo control , counterbalance crossover study design , 80 healthy overweight obese subject assess 12 week isoenergetic diet , accompany 4.5 g/day Spirulina maximum intake and/or systematic physical exercise program moderate intensity . Body composition , VO2 consumption , heart rate , blood lactate , plasma concentration triacylglycerols , total , low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , antioxidant status , lipid oxidation , protein carbonyl , superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , paraoxonase assess . Discussion : Spirulina maximum exercise good alternative improve general fitness , prevent lessen dyslipidemia oxidative stress subject risk factor chronic noncommunicable disease . However independent synergistic effect Spirulina maximum exercise dyslipidemias stress overweight obesity yet know .</detailed_description>
