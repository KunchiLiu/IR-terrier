	<brief_summary>The MILD project randomize lung cancer screen trial whose primary aim evaluate impact mortality early lung cancer detection LDCT ( low-dose compute tomography ) 2 group : control group undergo program primary prevention pulmonary function test evaluation group undergo periodic spiral CT associate primary prevention pulmonary function test evaluation . This last one also randomize two arm : yearly low-dose CT v CT every 2 year . MILD trial comprehensive design combine first time primary prevention ( smoke cessation ) early detection , molecular risk profile assess value blood tissue biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The preliminary result pilot study early lung cancer detection spiral CT PET launch Milan 2000 publish Lancet 2003 show positive outcome , confirm essential safety spiral CT high proportion ( 95 % ) complete resection stage I disease ( 77 % ) . However , result six year reveal different picture , increase number advance lung cancer detect third fifth year , evidence significant mortality reduction lung cancer annual CT monitoring cohort heavy smoker . These data confirm meta-analysis conduct two senior epidemiologist Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , Peter Bach Colin Begg , three concurrent single arm study : IEO/INT , Mayo Clinic Lee Moffitt Cancer Center trial . Such meta-analysis demonstrate annual CT increase 3-4 fold number detect lung cancer reduce incidence advance potentially lethal disease . These data strengthen validity plan continue clinical research early lung cancer detection randomize control study 2005 . In fact overwhelming consensus International scientific community uncontrolled observational study able provide knowledge field . Only large randomise controlled clinical trial hopefully provide convince evidence magnitude benefit achievable early detection program spiral CT heavy smoker . In 2005 , support AIRC ( Italian Association Cancer Research ) Ministry Health , investigator launch new INT ( National Institute Tumors ) randomize control study , name Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial ( MILD ) , combine smoke cessation early diagnosis biologic assessment individual risk lung cancer . The initial goal INT recruit 10,000 subject 10 different Italian centre end 2008 . This task prove unfeasible number reason , include lack available institution sufficient experience logistic facility run large long-term trial , strong campaign medium favor early detection programme , make randomisation control arm unacceptable large proportion volunteer . As matter fact , despite formal collaboration Istituto Superiore di Sanità ( ISS Rome ) , sign February 2006 , acceptance protocol Ethics Committee many Italian centre , two Institutions start active accrual July 2007 . As consequence , INT decide increase target MILD trial 4000 subject , aim join two Italian randomize study ( DANTE ITALUNG ) provide strong Italian meta-analysis least 10,000 subject , might future compare two large on-going randomised trial , NCI trial United States Nelson trial northern Europe ( Netherlands , Belgium , Denmark ) , provide concurrent data southern European population . MILD study recruit subject randomize 2 group : control group undergoes program primary prevention pulmonary function test evaluation group periodic spiral CT associate primary prevention pulmonary function test evaluation . The last one randomize two arm : yearly low-dose CT v CT every 2 year . MILD trial comprehensive design combine first time primary prevention early detection molecular risk profile represent innovative research lung cancer . The investigator recruit volunteer newspaper television campaign , provide information study design eligibility criterion . The participant ask sign write informed consent randomization one two group . Upon arrival , subject give questionnaire complete return leave centre . It include brief personal family medical history , smoke detail information attempt assistance stop smoking . A blood sample collect subject baseline every two year follow-up . A basic spirometry perform occasion . Randomization : - Control group protocol Control group undergo program primary prevention pulmonary function test evaluation blood collection . Each participant contact annually collect relevant data health status , hospital admission , diagnosis treatment concurrent disease , particular emphasis respiratory disorder interval cancer . The study database update real time information . - CT scan group protocol Baseline annual single-slice spiral CT perform without contrast material , low-dose protocol , reconstruction lung algorithm every 1 5 mm . The CT scanner 16 slice . Effective radiation dose equivalent 1.54 mSv ( milliSievert ) . Examinations independently report two radiologist within 6 day , dedicate workstation standard lung mediastinum windows maximum projection visual resolution reconstruction , between-observer variability test . A sophisticate algorithm volumetric reconstruction CAD ( Computer-Aided Detection ) software use . Investigators deem calcified nodule lesion maximum diameter 5 mm ( measure lung window ) non-suspicious schedule repeat low-dose CT next year , per protocol . Spiral thin-section CT limit area interest examination growth assessment complete within 3 month baseline CT every case non-calcified lesion large 5 mm . Non-calcified lesion 7 mm large , test fluorine-18-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose PET ( positron emission tomography ) calculation standardise uptake value . For patient , metabolic activity lung nodule assess standardised uptake value , measure region interest manually draw around nodule transaxial image . Blood sample plasma collection In group sample peripheral blood collect first evaluation . Five aliquot 1 millilitre whole blood frozen -80°C . The aim biomarker proteomic analysis evaluation individual genetic lung cancer risk ass whether analysis identify individual high risk cancer , improve sensitivity specificity image technique , low-dose CT scan PET scan , . A team research nurse , data manager , study coordinator maintain continuous contact enrol volunteer guarantee appropriate follow-up . Each participant recall least twice yearly collect relevant data health status , hospital admission , diagnosis treatment concurrent disease , particular emphasis respiratory disorder interval cancer . The study database update real time information . In group , pulmonary function test evaluate spirometer connect computer analysis data . The following parameter register : force vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , amount air exhale may measure 1 second ( FEV1 ) , force expiratory flow 25 % 75 % , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) . People even brief counsel session health care professional likely quit smoking . The ASK , ADVISE , ASSESS , ASSIST , ARRANGE model develop help health care professional patient smoke . The physician ask patient smoking status every visit ; advise patient stop smoking ; assess patient 's willingness quit ; assist patient set date quit smoking , provide self-help material , recommend use nicotine replacement therapy ( nicotine patch ) ; arrange follow-up visit . At present , blood sample aliquot collect stored MILD tissue bank , well cancer healthy tissue sample surgically resect case . Also strong commitment biological research boost increase spectrum MILD-related study , cover proteomic micro-arrays analysis , launch new research initiative aim evaluation role COPD ( Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) lung cancer development , particular interest structural , morphologic proteomic inflammatory damage relate lung cancer .</detailed_description>
