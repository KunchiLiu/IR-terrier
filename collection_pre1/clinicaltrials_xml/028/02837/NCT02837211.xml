	<brief_summary>TREND pilot randomize trial compare two alternative method initiate low-calorie weight loss diet . The study compare traditional diet initiation abruptly drop energy intake 1000 kcal/day woman 1200 kcal/day men versus 6 week taper energy intake baseline level . These two approach compare respect impact energy regulatory system body , weight loss measure , year diet initiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The TREND Study : Tapered Reduction Energy Intake Novel Approach Dieting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diets mainstay many obesity treatment program , yet fail variety reason . Patients find difficult comply caloric restriction active weight loss , adhere long-term change promote weight loss maintenance . Underlying difficulty number physiologic change enact body response energy restriction . These change promote increased hunger , decrease satiety slow metabolic rate , make diet compliance sustain weight loss difficult . From body 's perspective , rapid substantial drop caloric intake may represent metabolic emergency , respond accordingly , attempt maintain body weight . Weight loss result achieve maintain large energy deficit , know whether initiation phase diet would likely promote success do gradually , form caloric taper . We hypothesize , slowly introduce prescribe caloric restriction period 1-2 month ( rather use immediate drop calorie ) , body 's homeostatic response energy restriction might blunt circumvent , result low level hunger , improved satiety , good preservation metabolic rate diet initiation - factor would promote adherence successful weight loss . To test hypothesis , investigator conduct pilot randomize feed trial compare two type low-calorie diet similar macronutrient composition . Although diet ultimately rely similar caloric deficit produce weight loss , differ point diet initiation . The following compare : ( 1 ) traditional diet , entire energy deficit initiate immediately ; ( 2 ) `` caloric taper '' diet , participant gradually reduce baseline level energy consumption lower calorie level require weight loss , 6-week period . After 2-week run-in establish equilibrium weight among 40 eligible person , 30 obese adult randomize 2 study arm follow 52 week . We compare two group respect follow outcome , measure term change baseline ( week 0 ) level : 1 . Circulating level orexogenic hormone , Ghrelin , week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 52 ; 2 . Circulating level `` satiety '' hormone , Leptin Glucagon-like Peptide ( GLP-1 ) week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 52 ; 3 . Body composition , assess dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , 24 52 week ; 4 . Resting metabolic rate assess indirect calorimetry 24 52 week ; 5 . Change body weight ( kg ) body mass index ( kg/m2 ) week 6,12 , 24 52 ; 6 . Self-reported hunger ( use VAS ) compliance program week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 52 . 7 . Change weight-related quality life , use IWQOL-LITE week 12 , 24 , 52 . Hypothesis : patient `` taper '' arm experience less activation body regulatory system design oppose weight loss , similar weight loss 24 week great weight loss maintenance 52 week , compare `` traditional low-calorie diet '' arm patient .</detailed_description>
