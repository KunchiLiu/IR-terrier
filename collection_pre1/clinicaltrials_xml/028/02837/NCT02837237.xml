	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics KBP-5074 Following Oral Administration Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , 2-part study design assess PK , safety , tolerability KBP-5074 patient undergo HD non-HD patient severe CKD ( define use eGFR ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2 base MDRD equation ) . The study conduct 4 clinical research unit ( CRUs ) US . Approximately 12 patient enrol study ( single cohort 6 patient Part 1 Part 2 ) . Parts 1 2 study conduct parallel . If Part 1 complete prior completion Part 2 , vice versa , PK , safety , tolerability analysis complete study part may proceed plan delayed base time respective study part .</detailed_description>
