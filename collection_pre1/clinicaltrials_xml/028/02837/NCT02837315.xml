	<brief_title>Improving Brief Marijuana Interventions With Behavioral Economic Supplement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 % college student regular marijuana user , risk cognitive academic problem , addiction , risk behavior drive impaired . Young adult marijuana user thus high-risk population may require intervention motivates marijuana reduction increase engagement constructive alternative marijuana use . Brief Motivational Interventions ( BMIS ) demonstrate efficacy alcohol use college student , lack consistent evidence efficacy marijuana use . This research team develop supplement alcohol BMIs , Substance-Free Activity Session ( SFAS ) , directly target behavioral economic mechanism substance-free reinforcement delay reward discount encourage development commitment academic career goal , highlight impact day-to-day pattern alcohol use academic engagement goal . A controlled pilot trial find SFAS improve BMI outcome sample heavy drinking college student , ongoing parent trial revision replicate extend result . This study evaluate SFAS use randomize 3-group ( BMI + SFAS vs. BMI + Relaxation Attention Control , vs. Assessment Only ) pilot trial 120 undergraduate ( 50 % female , 40 % minority ) report use marijuana &gt; 5 day past-month . It hypothesize 1-month next-semester follow-up ( follow-up wed academic calendar allow representative measurement marijuana use activity pattern ) BMI+SFAS participant report significantly low level marijuana use problem , reduction exceed BMI + Relaxation Assessment-Only participant . Exploratory analyse test hypothesis ( ) BMI + SFAS effective participant report high baseline marijuana reinforce efficacy delay reward discounting ; ( b ) advantage BMI + SFAS marijuana use mediate increased participation substance-free activity . Support hypothesis would extend behavioral economic theory would provide initial validation approach could use reduce marijuana misuse among increase population college student misuse marijuana . Furthermore , give focus SFAS increase academic/campus engagement , work potential widespread dissemination .</detailed_description>
