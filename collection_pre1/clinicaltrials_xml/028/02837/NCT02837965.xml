	<brief_title>Observational Study Assessing Outcomes , Treatment Patterns Related Costs Patients Bullous Pemphigoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bullous pemphigoid common autoimmune blister disease skin , usually affect elderly . It chronic disease characterize spontaneous exacerbation remission . Bullous pemphigoid mediate IgG autoantibody direct hemidesmosomal protein ( BP180 , BP230 ) , involve dermal-epidermal adhesion skin . The diagnosis bullous pemphigoid base clinical immunopathological finding , include skin direct immunofluorescence . The disease usually require average 1-year duration treatment although long-term maintenance therapy may necessary case . High dos oral corticosteroid consider mainstay treatment many year , deleterious , high rate treatment side effect , include mortality . Topical superpotent corticosteroid demonstrate effective safer high dose oral corticosteroid , reduce side effect mortality rate , control disease 95 % 100 % case . Despite high efficacy , topical superpotent corticosteroid therapy often consider poorly convenient . In addition , immunosuppressant drug methotrexate poorly tolerate frequently contra-indicated elderly patient bullous pemphigoid . To date , study evaluate real-world use cost different treatment disease . Purpose The project observational , multi-center , prospective , non-interventional open-label data collection study assess outcome , adverse event , treatment pattern related cost patient diagnose bullous pemphigoid . The patient enrollment period 1 year follow-up ( observation period ) 1 year patient . Four dermatology centre France participate . Primary objective : The specific goal describe patient bullous pemphigoid therapeutic management , include : ) topical systemic medication nursing care ; ii ) clinical biological monitoring iii ) clinical outcome first year treatment . The hypothesis answer study topical superpotent corticosteroid therapy properly use treat bullous pemphigoid real-world life recommend French guideline whether treatment influence medical cost comparison systemic therapy ( e.g . methotrexate prednisone ) . Secondary objective : - To determine factor influence first-line therapy : topical superpotent corticosteroid therapy ( treatment scheme 1 TS1 ) versus systemic therapy ( treatment scheme 2 TS2 ) . - To determine factor influence disease outcome first year treatment , especially TS1 versus TS2 . - To determine total , medical non-medical cost , first year treatment compare cost patient treat accord TS1 versus TS2 . Exploratory objectives - To sequentially evaluate several blood biomarkers , include anti-BP180 anti-BP230 IgG autoantibody , IL-17 , IL-23 , IL-12 biologic maker compare accord treatment scheme ( TS1 versus TS2 ) . Included patient bullous pemphigoid follow 1 year . Baseline 6 follow-up visit plan record disease activity , treatment laboratory monitoring modality collect blood sample ancillary study . Clinical data record baseline gender , age associate medical condition ( neurological disorder : dementia , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis ; malignancy ; disease ) . Baseline clinical evaluation include number daily new blister 3 consecutive day , localization skin mucous membrane blister erosion BPDAI ( bullous pemphigoid disease area index ) . Extensive bullous pemphigoid define occurrence least 10 new daily blister . The first-line treatment use record ( superpotent topical CS , i.e . clobetasol propionate cream , 20-30g per day ; methotrexate ; systemic therapy ) . At visit , presence pruritus , erythematous eczematous urticarial plaque , number new daily blister record BPDAI ( bullous pemphigoid disease area index ) calculate . Topical systemic treatment bullous pemphigoid record visit , occurrence date relapse , eventually occur . Relapse define reappearance â‰¥3 new daily blister along pruritus and/or erythematous , eczematous urticarial plaque .</detailed_description>
