	<brief_title>Effect Tube Feeding Gastroesophageal Reflux Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due several promote factor related physiological immaturity gastro-intestinal tract , gastro-esophageal reflux ( GER ) frequent condition among preterm infant . GER clinical presentation may vary within wide range symptom , vomit , regurgitation cardiorespiratory event common preterm population . Combined pH multiple intraluminal impedance ( pH-MII ) currently consider best choice GER diagnosis preterm infant . While pH monitoring limited detection acid reflux , combine pH-MII effectively identify acid non-acid GER , predominant preterm infant . Moreover , allow evaluate height reach refluxate within esophageal lumen distinguish retrograde fluid bolus movement ( reflux ) anterograde one ( swallow ) . In last decade , GER pharmacological treatment increasingly widespread Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) . The provision anti-histamine2 blocker proton pump inhibitor preterm population , however , might lead adverse effect increase incidence necrotizing enterocolitis infection . Hence , avoid useless potentially harmful pharmacological overtreatment , step-wise approach , firstly promote conservative strategy , currently consider advisable choice GER management symptomatic preterm infant . Postural dietary intervention common conservative strategy efficacy improve GER symptom feature largely investigated . As previously assess pH-MII , prone left-side position effective right-side supine one significantly improve acid non-acid GER feature . Feed thicken widely employ reduce vomit regurgitation symptomatic term infant ; regard preterm population , however , little data currently available . The efficacy thicken fortified human milk preterm infant GER symptoms previously investigate , observe benefit . Furthermore , standard human milk fortification show increase GER frequency preterm infant . With regard anti-regurgitation ( AR ) formula , effectiveness specific AR formula , thicken amylopectin specifically tailored preterm infant ' nutritional need , recently evaluate ; test thicken formula effectively reduce number acid GERs , difference observe frequency non-acid GERs mean esophageal acid exposure , know main determinant development gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Thus , accord data , feed thicken seem almost ineffective improving GER symptoms feature preterm infant . Due prematurity , preterm infant &lt; 34 week gestation unable coordinate sucking , swallow breathing ; thus , ensure adequate enteral intake , usually feed via intragastric tube . Continuous bolus feed common technique enteral tube feed NICU setting . The latter show stimulate cyclical surge gastrointestinal hormone , thus consider physiological . It entail administration meal gravity infusion pump total duration 10 minute , feed tube could remove . However , short time elapse tube insertion bolus administration subsequent removal might provoke vagal response , characterize bradycardia temporary reduction cardiac output . Moreover , rapid gastric distension follow bolus administration could increase pressure low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) , thus contribute refluxate gastric content esophageal lumen . On hand , continuous feeding allow administer enteral feed longer period ( e.g . 2 3 hour ) , slow flow rate . It associate good absorption nutrient faster gastric emptying , thus may preferable case delay gastric motility , gastric residual abdominal distension . Moreover , slow rate infusion prevents rapid gastric distension ; however , feed method require permanence feed tube LES whole feeding period , could predispose occurrence gastro-esophageal reflux . The effect bolus continuous feed cardio-respiratory event , could represent clinical atypical manifestation GER , recently evaluate , observe slight significant increase apneic episodes continuous feeding . A recent systematic review aim evaluate tube-feeding method could suitable low birth weight infant GER symptom ; however , current data scarce controversial allow draw definitive conclusion . The aim study evaluate effect different enteral tube feed modality , bolus continuous feeding , pH-MII GER feature tube-fed preterm infant ≤33 week gestation , undergoing diagnostic pH-MII evaluation . Overall , thirty preterm infant ≤33 week gestation enrol suffer moderate/severe GER symptom diagnostic 24-hour pH-MII monitoring schedule evaluate GER feature , accord clinical practice . During 24-h pH-MII monitoring , infant receive meal ( usually 8 ) accord follow sequence : - 1st meal : optional modality ( consider statistical analysis ) ; - 2nd meal : continuous feed 3 hour ; - 3rd meal : bolus feeding ; feed tube remain place whole post-prandial period ; - 4th meal : bolus feeding ; feed tube remove feed administration ; - 5th : continuous feed 3 hour ; - 6th : bolus feeding ; feed tube remain place whole post-prandial period ; - 7th : bolus feeding ; feed tube remove feed administration ; - 8th : optional modality ( consider statistical analysis ) . Healthcare assistant inspect correct application sequence . The pH-MII device use study ( Comfortec pH-MII Sandhill Scientific® ) nasogastric probe seven ring , compose six dipolar impedance channel one antimony electrode responsible pH detection place middle distal impedance dipole . Due characteristic , pH-MII able measure esophageal height reach refluxate identify direction esophageal bolus movement , thereby distinguish retrograde flow ( reflux ) anti-retrograde flow ( swallow ) . The distance infant 's nose LES determine Strobel 's formula : [ baby length ( cm ) x 0.252 + 5 ) ] - 13 % . After placement , probe 's position radiographically confirm . Data pH-MII record automatically acquire portable Sleuth Sandhill Scientific system store personal computer contain specific software ( BioVIEW Analysis Sandhill Scientific , version 5.0.9 ) . Data analysis perform aforementioned software confirm direct visual evaluation . Statistical analysis perform SPSS 20 ( Statistical Package Social Sciences , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) Windows . Differences different modality term GER frequency feature test Friedman test ( level significance : p &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
