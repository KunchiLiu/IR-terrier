	<brief_title>Preauthorization Versus Prospective Audit Antimicrobial Stewardship Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Antimicrobial stewardship program ( ASP ) recommend improve appropriate antimicrobial use , reduce bacterial resistance , unnecessary drug cost enhance patient health outcome . Two core strategy ASP recommend effective guideline formulary restriction drug preauthorization prospective audit feedback . Preauthorization current strategy use hospital , hospital Taiwan worldwide use prospective audit feedback . Preauthorization require intensive manpower maintain timeliness antimicrobial use . This study evaluate policy change strategy use antimicrobial stewardship . Investigators evaluate effectiveness 2 strategy use antimicrobial utilization patient outcome . Methods : During stepwise change policy antimicrobial stewardship program hospital , study observe difference two standardize core strategy ( preauthorization vs prospective audit ) ASP . Hospitalized patient age 20 , require use restrict antimicrobial recruit study . Signing consent form waive since strategy already proven effective widely implement Taiwan worldwide . Also , evaluation policy change impact patient safety patient right . The conduction study require contact patient clinical sample collect . All data require analysis collect via computerized patient care system . Patient data protect via de-linking . Patients exclude admit enter intensive care unit within 48 hour entry , infectious disease consultation request . Eligible patient randomize either preauthorization , current practice hospital ; prospective audit , do 48-72 hour prescription , current practice hospital Taiwan worldwide . Managing physician obligate follow advice investigator intervene management decision . Primary outcome include antimicrobial utilization , drug cost patient outcomes length stay clinical improvement . The time spend implement two strategy compare . The study hypothesis preauthorization group impact reduction antimicrobial cost utilization , especially first 72 hour , compare prospective audit . However , patient outcome likely similar . Antimicrobial stewardship program use preauthorization core strategy compare prospective audit feedback similar patient outcome , may reduce antimicrobial utilization .</detailed_description>
