	<detailed_description>Primary Cervical Dystonia ( PCD ) common type focal dystonia . In addition pain , PCD associate disability many activity daily live ; social stigma embarrassment ; decrease quality life . Botulinum toxin ( BoNT ) therapy `` gold standard '' treatment PCD . Although effective improve dystonia symptom , BoNT injection associate suboptimal improvement benefit BoNT may last shorter expect time frame 12 week . PCD subject refer deep brain stimulation surgery poor inconsistent response medical treatment . In addition need repetitive injection , subject may suffer side effect neck pain , muscle weakness , head drop , breathe difficulty , swallow issue . BoNT therapy outcome likely improve unless investigator understand underlie mechanisms action . The primary goal study examine physiological effect BoNT therapy advance understand pathophysiology dystonia . BoNT therapy commonly perceive induce peripheral muscle weakness inhibition acetylcholine release neuromuscular junction . However many argue likely primary mechanism action , many subject improvement dystonia without discernible muscle weakness others significant weakness improvement dystonia . Indeed , BoNT propose induce central effect possibly relate modulation muscle spindle afferent feedback retrograde transport toxin central nervous system . A lead theory underpinning pathophysiology dystonia loss motor inhibition ( increased excitability ) level spinal cord , brainstem motor cortex . Thus , modulation pathology central pathway critical control dystonia . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) noninvasive physiological technique assessment motor cortex excitability . Paired-pulse TMS paradigm , short-interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) intracortical facilitation ( ICF ) well establish paradigms evaluation motor cortex excitability . SICI measure deliver subthreshold conditioning pulse prior suprathreshold test pulse short interstimulus interval ( ISI ) 1-5 millisecond ( m ) result low motor evoke potential ( MEP ) response test pulse . SICI regard gamma-aminobutyric acid A ( GABA-A ) receptor-mediated inhibition involve activation cortical inhibitory interneurons . ICF measure use paradigm similar SICI long ISI 8-30 m result increase MEP response . Glutamate probably involve produce ICF cortical facilitation . In focal dystonia , include PCD , failure SICI record hand muscle , conversely , enhance ICF record hand muscle . These paradigm record neck muscle technically challenge . Nevertheless important finding note PCD , motor cortical inhibition widespread extend beyond area symptomatic muscle . TMS use assess effect BoNT SICI subject arm dystonia . SICI distal hand muscle increase one month BoNT injection return previously abnormal level excitability three month . It speculate BoNT therapy arm muscle modulate afferent input muscle , probably result reorganization motor cortex . It clear physiological change induce BoNT therapy correlation clinical improvement . In addition , clear change motor cortex excitability ultimately affect corticospinal drive dystonic muscle . In study , investigator focus physiological effect BoNT use broad TMS measure motor cortex excitability . The central hypothesis BoNT modulate motor cortex excitability corticospinal drive muscle physiological effect BoNT clear correlation clinical response . To test hypothesis , investigator plan measure corticospinal drive dystonic muscle use electromyographic ( EMG ) spectral analysis . They record clinical outcome Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale ( TWSTRS ) standardize validated rating scale PCD . The first second aim focus physiological aspect BoNT therapy PCD . The investigator plan determine cortical corticospinal physiologic change time peak BoNT effect ( BoNT ON ) typically see around 4-8 week injection time wear related BoNT therapy correspond time next injection cycle ( BoNT OFF ) . The third aim help investigator understand physiological difference clinical responder non-responders . Healthy control enrolled normative physiological data . The main significance study advancement physiological knowledge relate BoNT therapy subject PCD . Aim 1 : To determine effect BoNT therapy motor cortex excitability PCD . TMS measure ( SICI , ICF , ... ) collect use standardized protocol time peak BoNT effect ( BoNT ON ) time trough BoNT effect ( BoNT OFF ) . Hypothesis 1 : The TMS measure normalize healthy control time peak BoNT effect effect reverse BoNT effect wear . Aim 2 : To determine effect BoNT therapy corticospinal drive PCD muscle . EMG spectral analysis auto-spectral peak 4-7 Hertz ( Hz ) sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) 10-12 Hz coherence SCM splenius capitis ( SPL ) use time peak ( BoNT ON ) trough BoNT effect ( BoNT OFF ) . Hypothesis 2 : The coherence SPL SCM muscle lose time peak BoNT effect . There re-appearance auto-spectral peak SPL muscle see healthy control . These spectral analysis change reverse BoNT effect wear trough . Aim 3 : To determine correlation physiological measure ( TMS EMG measure ) peak BoNT effect clinical score . Hypothesis 3 : The change TMS measure EMG spectral finding time peak BoNT effect correlate change clinical score Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale ( TWSTRS ) scale .</detailed_description>
