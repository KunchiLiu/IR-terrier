	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : - To find safe study drug , pembrolizumab , combine stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) liver . - To see well subject tolerate treatment pembrolizumab SBRT . - To find often colorectal cancer come back 1 year surgically remove know disease treat SBRT pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PI Pembro Combination With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Liver Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1b feasibility study evaluate use PD-1 blockade combination ablative radiotherapy treatment metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . This study examine sequential combination stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) pembrolizumab patient goal eradicate know site disease . It likely many patient SBRT therapy complete follow modality include operative resection ablation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial Have diagnosis histologically confirm metastatic colorectal cancer liver ( sit metastatic disease ) * Histologic confirmation colorectal primary tumor acceptable accompanied radiographic evidence metastatic disease Tumor must mismatch repair ( MMR ) proficient determine microsatellite instability immunohistochemistry MMR proteins Microsatellite instability test must MSIstable MSIlow Or IHC MMR proteins must demonstrate intact MMR proteins Participant must candidate SBRT least one intrahepatic lesion . There limit number intrahepatic lesion patient may Participant must surgical candidate therapeutic goal eradicate know disease one additional surgery Prior resection extrahepatic metastatic disease allow complete 12 month previous study enrollment new extrahepatic disease find Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 Fresh archive colorectal cancer tissue , preferably hepatic metastatic site . Archival tissue acceptable enrol study . Participants archival tissue available need undergo new biopsy solely purpose study Participants must receive least one prior line chemotherapy include irinotecan oxaliplatinfluoropyrimidinebased systemic treatment colorectal cancer Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 . These lab repeat complete within 10 day SBRT treatment initiation Female participant childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 10 day initiate SBRT . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require Female participant childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Participants childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year Male participant agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy Current participation receiving study therapy previous participation study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week initiation SBRT Prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 ( first day SBRT treatment ) recover ( i.e . &lt; Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e . &lt; Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Prior radiotherapy liver allow Participants &lt; Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study If participant receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy Participant diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior initiation SBRT Participant know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients Participant prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 ( first day SBRT treatment ) recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Participant prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Prior radiotherapy liver allow . ( Notes : Participants ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . If participant receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . ) Participant know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Participant know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Participants previously resect brain metastasis may participate provide least 6 month CNS progression identify . Participant active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Participant known history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Participant active infection require systemic therapy . Participant history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere participant 's participation full duration trial , best interest participant participate , opinion treat investigator . Participant know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Participant pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Participant receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Participant known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Participant know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative quantitative ] detect ) . Participant receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy .</criteria>
