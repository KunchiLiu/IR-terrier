	<brief_title>Pilot RCT Pos4Health Nonadherent HIV+ Substance Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improving treatment adherence among active substance user require address many health barrier beyond substance use alone . ( Dr N. Zaller Ph . D , Gillani , &amp; Rich , 2007 ; Simoni , Amico , Pearson , &amp; Malow , 2008 ; Willenbring , 2005 ) Behaviors like smoke drug use , experience like poverty , poor social support , stigma , fear HIV disclosure , depression , anxiety , reduce antiretroviral ( ART ) adherence engagement care , accelerate disease progression . ( Atkinson &amp; Petrozzino , 2009 ; Bouhnik et al. , 2002 ; Hendershot , Stoner , Pantalone , &amp; Simoni , 2009 ; Mugavero et al. , 2009 ; Shuter &amp; Bernstein , 2008 ; Simoni , Frick , &amp; Huang , 2006 ; Tucker , Burnam , Sherbourne , Kung , &amp; Gifford , 2003 ; Villes et al. , 2007 ) Improving multiple health behavior related nonadherence promising approach use current project . Emerging evidence support simultaneously target multiple health behavior . ( Prochaska et al. , 2008 ) Unfortunately , intervention address range issue undermine adherence HIV care . Extending program research investigative team , project develop patient-centered eHealth intervention ; specifically , Internet intervention , target multiple issue nonadherence HIV . The specific aim : 1 . To develop prototype patient-centered eHealth ( Internet ) intervention target adherence set behavior experience know undermine adherence among non-urban PLWH . 2 . To evaluate prototype usability , feasibility acceptability among PLWH HIV care clinician , modify use PLWH clinician feedback , finalize pilot test 3 . To pilot test finalize intervention determine whether warrant subsequent randomize clinical trial . The pilot test : 1. evaluate feasibility eHealth intervention examine access , usage , refusal vs. enrollment , retention vs. dropout , etc . use web-tracked process data interview 2. provide preliminary data impact eHealth intervention knowledge usage strategy adherence target experience behavior undermines ART adherence 3. test variable likely use primary outcome marker subsequent RCT variance population ( i.e. , adherence pharmacy refill rate , rate miss HIV care visit , rate drug-using day , rate risky drinking day ) If pilot test new patient-centered eHealth intervention show impact knowledge use strategy , prove feasible acceptable , tested subsequent RCT .</detailed_description>
