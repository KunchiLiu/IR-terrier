	<brief_title>Neural Mechanisms Associated With Risk Smoking Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking great preventable cause mortality significant economic burden . Even best available treatment , smoker relapse within day week quit attempt . Nicotine replacement therapy , widely use pharmacotherapy , yield end treatment quit rate &lt; 25 % suggest manage nicotine withdrawal sufficient . To improve quit rate significantly , refine mechanistic understanding need . Neuroimaging identify mechanism underlie behavior change beyond self-report behavioral measure . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study show brief ( e.g. , 24 hr . ) abstinence smoking produce work memory deficit associate reduced neural activity cognitive control circuit weaken rest state functional connectivity . Neural reactivity smoking cue also increase risk relapse , psychological stress enhance neural response smoke cue increase smoke intensity . This study examine abstinence-induced brain change contribute clinical outcome treatment-seeking smoker . Using validated fMRI abstinence challenge paradigm , 200 treatment-seeking smoker complete two 1-hour pre-treatment fMRI scan : smoking satiety 24 hour confirm abstinence . The investigator examine brain response performance task probe work memory , cue reactivity , stress response well rest state functional connectivity . Participants set target quit date , receive smoke cessation counseling , monitor 6 month assess time relapse use validate smoking relapse protocol .</detailed_description>
