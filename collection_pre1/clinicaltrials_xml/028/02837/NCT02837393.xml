	<brief_summary>The investigator objective determine urinary electrolyte abnormality exist one kidney participant without history kidney stone . To meet objective , investigator go take urine sample kidney time kidney stone surgery . The sample analyze absolute relative difference concentration urine electrolyte , calcium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nephrolithiasis common within general population . Although majority patient symptomatic stone event require surgical intervention , rate recurrence high . Therefore , reduce rate recurrence important . Traditionally , achieve combination serum urine metabolic evaluation follow targeted medication dietary intervention . Specifically , recommend single 24-hour urine collection analysis urine electrolytes perform . A 24-hour urine collection bladder urine , pool urine kidney . The urine analyzed relative absolute concentration electrolytes small molecule know associated stone formation . These include creatinine , calcium , citrate , oxalate , potassium , magnesium , phosphate , uric acid , urate . When abnormality detect 24-hour urine collection assumption due global metabolic defect present kidney . However , may case . It possible could relative imbalance kidney defect , different degree ( different defect one multiple electrolytes ) . It also possible one kidney dominant defect , contralateral kidney normal , therefore 24-hour urine collection would represent dominant kidney defect . Finally , possible converse true . One kidney defect , contralateral kidney minor defect . In example , 24-hour urine collection would appear normal dominant normal kidney mask minor defect . This concept differential kidney electrolyte handle previously describe child . Therefore , understand individual kidney metabolic profile important . The purpose investigator ' study ( 1 ) characterize urine electrolyte profile individual renal unit ; ( 2 ) identify participant differences renal unit urine electrolyte profile , renal unit bladder urine electrolyte profile ; ( 3 ) correlate difference renal unit urine electrolyte profile clinical manifestation kidney stone , stone formation growth . By characterize individual renal unit urine electrolyte profile , investigator ' may able isolate phenotype stone former would otherwise identify traditional 24-hour urine collection . The investigator ' target phenotype future investigation dietary medication intervention hopefully prevent future stone event .</detailed_description>
