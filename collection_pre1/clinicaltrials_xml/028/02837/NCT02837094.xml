	<detailed_description>Type 1 Diabetes cause body 's white blood cell damaging insulin produce cell pancreas . The aim develop treatment slow stop process switch white blood cell cause damage . The aim study investigate whether give treatment involve peptide fragment relate insulin attach gold nanoparticles safe significant side-effects . Participants need : 1 . Diagnosed type 1 diabetes 3 month . 2 . Aged 18 40 year . 3 . Prescribed insulin within 1 month diagnosis . Participants blood test ass whether right tissue type study . If suitable , ask attend local research centre general examination blood urine test . If participant still insulin response post meal urine test proceed first injection . Each participant 3 injection treatment , give 4 week apart . During treatment , participant undergo various monitor include blood &amp; urine test , mixed meal tolerance test , lymph node biopsy . A follow appointment take place 6 week last injection . Possible side effect include bruise discomfort site blood test lymph node test , local redness swell reaction site injection , severe allergic reaction injection require treatment , steroid , adrenaline fluid . Participants time staff member discuss diabetes ask question routine clinic appointment . It know whether receive gold particle-peptide injection benefit , first study treatment use human .</detailed_description>
