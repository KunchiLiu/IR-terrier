	<brief_summary>The study randomize study patient live four municipality Eastern Jutland . After geriatric assessment half patient offer tailor-made intervention home . The follow-up last least 90 day include treatment patient ' multimorbidity , e.g . dehydration , anaemia , infection , malnutrition . The half patient , result assessment recommendation give patient general practitioner . The primary efficacy variable accomplishment planned cancer treatment , reduction complication admission hospital increase quality life , . If geriatric assessment tailor-made follow-up result well quality life le complication admission offer may extend long period , young age group cancer diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancer head neck ( HNC ) , lung ( LC ) , upper gastrointestinal channel ( CUGI ) colo-rectal cancer ( CRC ) account approximately 40 % cancer incidence elderly people ( define ≥70 year ) Denmark ( DK ) . The four cancer account 50 % annual cancer-related death DK . Incidence mortality cancer increase age . Comorbidity ( simultaneous presence several medical condition ) present old cancer patient younger This mean old cancer patient vulnerable physiological , psychological social mean young . Older cancer patient frequent develop side effect cancer treatment young cancer patient . Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ) , comprehensive investigation assessment various aspect person 's health , carry multidisciplinary team order identify , quantify problem follow identify problem . CGA comprise collect information comorbidity , polypharmacy , physical , psychological cognitive problem , nutritional status social support . Problems area implies bad prognosis term survival , response treatment side effect cancer treatment . CGA show able identify novel health problem half elderly patient cancer . It previously show focused palliative care patient lung cancer focus optimization medication follow unresolved problem increase quality life , ease depressive symptom increase survival . CGA show effective base intervention order increase survival elderly general ( known cancer ) , order increase physical cognitive status , reduce need change housing facility . Geriatric intervention base CGA call Comprehensive Geriatric Care ( CGC ) . Frailty condition occur result decline physiological reserve , cause vulnerability health stressor . One way define frailty base CGA , patient divide `` frail '' `` vulnerable/pre-frail '' `` fit '' perform CGA : Frail : patient meet one follow : dependence Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) , severe comorbidity , cognitive dysfunction , depression , malnutrition , 7 different fix daily preparation time CGA , ( multivitamin include ) . Fit patient : independent ADL Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) , minimal comorbidity , Cognitively intact nutritional problem . Vulnerable / pre-frail patient : Neither Fit frail . Frailty potentially reversible mode . It know elderly patient may develop frailty cancer treatment . From previously conduct study 217 elderly patient HNC , LC , CRC CUGI , know large part patient frail ( 52 % ) vulnerable ( 35 % ) . Only 13 % fit . But know effect provide geriatric follow-up population regard complication cancer treatment , include ability able accomplish cancer treatment plan possibility reduce hospital stay . A study carry patient discharge Emergency Department Geriatric ward , show possible reduce admission time offer CGA related admission add follow-up CGC compare provide CGA patient hospital . In study , hospitalization reduce 55 % It previously show CGA outpatient set subsequent Geriatric follow problem identify reduce hospitalization time increase proportion accomplish cancer treatment per protocol older cancer patient 1 status examination compare patient get CGA outpatient setting , get geriatric follow-up afterwards . It 's oncology practice first outpatient attendance define type cancer patient must , include type treatment , aim treatment ( neoadjuvant , adjuvant , curative palliative ( life-prolonging / palliative ) ) , dose treatment duration treatment status examination . Intervention CGC intervention tailor individual patient base problem area identify CGA problem occur within 90 day enrollment . It include home visit , visit Aarhus University Hospital ( AUH ) outpatient setting , schedule demand telephone contact . Patients follow 90 day enrollment reference specialize palliative care treatment death . The geriatric intervention may consist liquid treatment , blood transfusion , oral intravenous antibiotic administration , oxygen therapy , pain management , social intervention , nutritional intervention lifeline telephone number The geriatric intervention different patient patient . There may many contact various kind . During 90 day number nature contact ( telephone / attendance / home visit ) record intervention perform registered ( medication change , social work , nutrition effort effort optimize Physical functioning ) Contact oncogeriatric team patient take initiative oncogeriatric team , patient relative . The oncogeriatric team initiate treatment refer another department , necessary . Controls For control group , result recommendation CGA , give patient regard . example medication change , social intervention ( eg . adaptation home care ) , physical optimization example . train nutrition recommendation summarize patient patient 's acceptance send practitioner . Otherwise , follow-upis performed period oncogeriatric team . After 3 month , intervention group control Group test CGA quality life questionnaire order compare baseline result compare control group intervention group . Blinding It possible blind subject randomization . Likewise , possible blind geriatric team charge follow-up result randomization . The person test subject 3 month blind randomization . Oncologists get information randomization .</detailed_description>
