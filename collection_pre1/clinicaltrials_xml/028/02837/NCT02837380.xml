	<brief_summary>This open-label study evaluate PK FF/UMEC/VI dose combination 100/62.5/25 mcg single repeat dose administration DPI healthy Chinese subject . This study evaluate systemic pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , FF/UMEC/VI Chinese healthy population administer use dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) blend combination UMEC/VI one strip FF second strip dose combination 100/62.5/25 mcg . The triple , fix dose combination product Fluticasone furoate ( FF ) / Vilanterol ( VI ) /Umeclidinium bromide ( UMEC ) new configuration enable delivery inhale long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) , Long-acting beta2 agonist ( LABA ) inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) single device . Approximately 16 subject enrol study . After take account allowable time window screen , treatment follow-up , subject study maximum duration 6-7 week .</brief_summary>
