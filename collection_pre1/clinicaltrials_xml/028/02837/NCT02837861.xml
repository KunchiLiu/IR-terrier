	<brief_summary>A randomized , parallel-group , pilot study compare effect early addition intravenous protein enteral feeding tolerate versus enteral feeding tolerate alone immediately post traumatic injury . Primary : To determine early adequate nutritional support improve protein economy first week post -injury measure nitrogen balance . We hypothesize improvement nitrogen balance early maximize protein intake support production acute phase protein , major antioxidant inflammatory response . Secondary : Through use mass spectrometry ( MS ) nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) technology determine plan early adequate nutritional support adequate protein day one post injury alter metabolomics profile compare routine nutritional support . Tertiary : For Specific Aim 3 measure several pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine soluble protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Subjects admit trauma service care SICU screen participation study . - If subject meet eligibility criterion , enrol randomized 1:1 enteral nutrition alone enteral nutrition plus Amino Acid ( AA ) infusion . - Nutritional assessment complete . - Various procedures/assessments take place course trial . - Subjects follow 28 day discharge disposition status . Potential subject deem eligible randomized REDCap Randomization Module begin study intervention within first 24 hour admission Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) . Subjects enrol Control Arm receive routine nutritional support ( RNS ) . RNS purpose study define : - Nutrition deliver via enteral route administration ; - Enteral caloric goal 60-80 % energy requirement ; - Enteral feeding initiate soon medically feasible ; - Full parenteral nutrition initiate Day 7 enteral nutrition start . Subjects complete study Day 5 continue nutritional support clinically indicate . Subjects enrol Experimental Arm receive RNS plus supplemental intravenous amino acid ( RNS+IVAA ) . RNS+IVAA purpose study define : - Nutrition deliver via enteral route administration ; - Enteral caloric goal 60-80 % energy requirement ; - Enteral feeding initiate soon medically feasible ; - Full parenteral nutrition initiate Day 7 enteral nutrition start . - Supplemental intravenous amino acid begin within 24 hour admission Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) ; - Amino acid supplement enteral protein total protein intake 1.5-2 g/kg/day . Subjects complete study Day 5 continue nutritional support clinically indicate . Allocation Treatment Randomization Procedures 40 subject recruit study randomize 1:1 ratio . This take place lot 10 ; permit evaluation data every ten subject . Potential subject deem eligible randomize blinded fashion REDCap Randomization Module receive either routine nutritional support , enteral feeding soon medically feasible supplement intravenous amino acid `` routine nutritional support enteral feeding soon medically feasible . Randomization treatment assignment list create statistician ; take consideration drop out replacement .</detailed_description>
