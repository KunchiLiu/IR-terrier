	<detailed_description>Most mortality advance chronic liver disease ( ACLD ) mediate so- call specific complication end-stage liver disease ( ESLD ) ; one important infection ( 25-30 % ) . Infection responsible considerable proportion ESLD-related mortality . Important pathogenesis infection ESLD CAIDS ( cirrhosis - associate immune dysfunction syndrome ) , recently re-named CAID ( Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Deficit ) . TRANSFER FACTOR ( TF ) suppose act several point CAID - cascade . This give rise hypothesis , TF could benefit AD/ACLF . Characteristics TF It show transmission fo T-Lymphocyte reactivity transmissible T-cells alone , also hommogenate peripheral white blood cell . Later become clear transmission cellular immunity responsible dialysable fraction T-lymphocytes homogenate ( small molecular weight 10 kDa ; consist amino acid , small peptide , nucleotide etc ) . This homogenate name Transfer - factor ( TF ) . One dose lyophilize drug contains : Leucocyti dialysatum 200 x 10 6 ( contains various IFNs , ILs , chemokines , endorfins , heat shock protein etc ) - stimulate T H 1 response - induces production IL-1 , IL-2 - activate chemotaxis immunocompetent cell - increase fagocytic activity - activate antigen-presentation APCs The aim study ass efficacy transfer factor decrease rate and/or severity infection ACLF .</detailed_description>
