	<brief_summary>The study compose sixty patient , require surgical extraction single impact mandibular third molar local anaesthesia . The patient randomly allocate one 3 group 20 . The three group categorize Group A ( intramuscular dexamethasone ) , Group B ( submucosal dexamethasone ) Group C ( control ) . The objective measurement facial pain , swell , trismus perform independent examiner baseline ( preoperatively ) , day 1 , 3 , 7 postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct prospective randomize comparative clinical study Department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery , Guanghua School Stomatology , Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou include 60 patient need surgical removal single impact mandibular third molar local anaesthesia . The study include 37 male 13 female age range 20 40 year . Ethical approval obtain Institutional Ethics Committee Guanghua School Stomatology , Sun Yat-sen University prior begin study . The signed consent form obtain patient explain risk benefit surgical procedure . All Sixty patient randomly assign one 3 group 20 irrespective age sex use single-blind technique . The three group categorize Group A ( intramuscular dexamethasone ) , Group B ( submucosal dexamethasone ) Group C ( steroid ) . Group A give 8mg intramuscular dexamethasone , Group B administer 4mg submucosal dexamethasone Group C steroid injection . The surgical procedure perform patient operator . Local anesthesia achieve use 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride 1:100 000 adrenaline standard technique follow block Inferior alveolar , lingual long buccal nerve patient . In Group A patient , 1 ml dexamethasone ( 4mg ) administer deltoid muscle commencement surgical procedure . In Group B patient , 1 ml dexamethasone administer submucosa local anesthesia Group C patient continue without receive preoperative medication . In Group B , standardize drug delivery third molar region investigator follow method describe Arakeri et al.6 third molar surgery . According technique , investigator divide 1 ml Dexamethasone ( 4mg ) 0.4 ml , 0.3 ml 0.3ml part . Following local anesthesia , part dexamethasone inject submucosally buccal ( 0.3 ml ) , lingual ( 0.3 ml ) retromolar ( 0.4 ml ) region around tooth extract ( Figure1 , 2 , 3 ) . Surgical access gain standard Terrence Ward 's incision raise full thickness mucoperiosteal flap . Bone removal do around tooth use round bur copious 0.9 % normal saline irrigation . The tooth section cemento-enamel junction whenever require Coupland elevator use elevate tooth fragment tooth socket . The socket examine debris sharp bony margin smoothen . The empty socket irrigate copiously flap suture use three simple interrupt 3-0 black braid silk suture . A small gauze pack place wound routine post-extraction instruction advise patient . The duration procedure incision last suture document . All patient give amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 h orally 5 day , 500 mg paracetamol postoperatively ( every 6 h 1 tablet 2 day ) . Patients instructed seek medical help postoperative discomfort without prior information surgeon . The patient recall postoperatively 1- , 3 5 day record swelling , trismus pain . Pain , mouth opening , facial swell objectively record first , third , seventh postoperative day independent examiner . Postoperative pain assess use visual analog scale ( VAS ) 10 point scale score 0 measure `` pain '' 10 correspond `` severe pain '' .18 Mouth opening measure use maximum distance maxillary central incisor mandibular central incisor . The difference sum post-operative measurement sum pre-operative measurement consider trismus . The evaluation facial swelling perform modification Schultze-Mosgau et al method,19 facial measurement involve : 1 . Tragus oral commissure 2.Tragus pogonion . The difference sum post-operative facial measurement sum pre-operative facial measurement consider facial swelling . The data tabulate electronically store . Descriptive statistic mean ( standard deviation ) use present data . Chi square test analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , appropriate , use assess significance difference . The level significance le 0.05 ( P &lt; 0.05 ) consider significant . Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 21</detailed_description>
