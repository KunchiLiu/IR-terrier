	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Preterm birth major health care concern although survival premature infant improve , incidence neonatal morbidity slightly decrease especially case extreme prematurity . Apnea prematurity ( immature respiratory control ) major complication Neonatal Intensive Care Units occur virtually infant bear 28 week gestation . Intermittent Hypoxemia ( IH ) , episodic oxygen desaturation event , generally attribute apnea prematurity often superimpose upon suboptimal lung function . Intermittent hypoxemia event common preterm infant may lead short-term long-term morbidity . Typically , incidence intermittent hypoxemia ( IH ) increase first 4 week life plateauing week 6-8 . In addition induce oxidative stress increase production reactive oxygen specie , hypoxemia/reoxygenation cycle think induce pro-inflammatory cascade transcription factor promote activation inflammatory cell result multisystem morbidity . These morbidity include retinopathy prematurity , cardiorespiratory instability , poor neurodevelopmental outcome . A potential morbidity yet investigate acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . AKI associate morbidity mortality critically ill neonate . The risk AKI high low birth weight infant require assist ventilation ionotropic support , infant congenital heart disease . Additionally , AKI occur frequently infant suffer severe birth asphyxia . While establish end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) associate worsen sleep apnea adult , propose sleep apnea nocturnal hypoxemia may contribute kidney injury , development chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , progression kidney failure . Proposed mechanisms kidney disease via intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia include 1 : direct intrarenal hypoxemia ( result tubulointerstitial injury ) 2 : increase oxidative stress , inflammatory cytokine , systemic blood pressure ( via activation renin-angiotensin system ) . Hence It plausible IH may modulate AKI preterm neonate . The investigator goal test hypothesis intermittent hypoxemia associate Acute Kidney Injury preterm infant . Investigation relationship IH AKI may provide insight onset prevention give recent advancement detection characterization AKI vulnerable population . SPECIFIC AIMS : AIM 1 : Test hypothesis intermittent hypoxemia associate kidney injury preterm infant , reflect rise serum creatinine . APPROACH : Premature infant GA 23 31 week prospectively recruit Kentucky Children 's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . High resolution oxygen saturation monitoring perform first 2 month life . Creatinine level collect obtain routinely premature infant NICU . Demographic data collect include gestational age , postnatal age , gender race . Clinical data include respiratory support , caffeine use , vital sign neonatal morbidity document . Scores predict severity disease mortality newborn use . The investigator assess cumulative effect IH AKI reflect serum creatinine measurement 1 month , 2 month , discharge extremely preterm infant . AIM 2 : Test hypothesis rise acute kidney injury urinary biomarkers increase intermittent hypoxemia . APPROACH : Similar Aim 1 , premature infant GA 23 31 week prospectively recruit Kentucky Children 's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . High resolution oxygen saturation monitoring perform first 2 month life . Urine collect daily first week life weekly 2 month age hospital discharge . Collecting urine noninvasive minimal risk . Samples de-identified store investigator research laboratory . Standardized kit measure biomarkers associate kidney injury albumin , β2-microglobulin ( β2MG ) , cystatin C ( Cys C ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , neutrophil gelatinase associate lipocalin ( NGAL ) , osteopontin ( OPN ) , uromodulin ( UMOD ) use . Since IH increase age persist NICU stay , cumulative effect intermittent hypoxemia correlate biomarker concentration weekly throughout study period discharge . Oxygen saturation continuously monitor upon admission high resolution pulse oximeter , 2 second average time 1Hz sample rate . Novel software utilized analyze raw data per follow definition : 1 . Intermittent Hypoxemia primarily define drop oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) less 80 % 4 second less 3 minute . Secondary measure IH include : 2 . A drop SpO2 &lt; 85 % &gt; 4 second &lt; 3 minute duration 3 . A decline SpO2 &gt; 4 % baseline &lt; 90 % last &gt; 4 second 4 . Percent time spend threshold , include sustain hypoxemia ( &gt; 3min duration ) 5 . Number hyperoxemic event define increase SpO2 &gt; 95 % 6 . Duration nadir oxygen desaturation hyperoxemic event 7 . Mean SpO2/day Sample size : There data available literature calculate sample size . Based NICU census , consent success rate , account data loss , investigator recruit total 50 patient pilot project . To maintain balanced sample , investigator stratify enrollment gestational age target 15-18 subject follow group : 23-25 week gestation , 26-28 week gestation , 29-31 week gestation .</detailed_description>
