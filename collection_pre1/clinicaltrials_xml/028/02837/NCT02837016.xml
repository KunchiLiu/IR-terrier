	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) investigate feasibility efficacy non-intrusive biofeedback device wear throughout day provide therapeutic cue college student suffer chronic anxiety . The biofeedback device detect physiological stress index real time ( e.g. , change breathe rate ) provide feedback ( e.g. , minor vibration text message ) serve cue wearer recall therapeutic step exactly moment need exert cognitive control . Students randomize 1 ) experimental group biofeedback device 2 ) experimental group without biofeedback device . Experimental group undergo intervention strengthen cognitive control mindfulness-based relaxation technique . Outcome measure include multi-method approach collect questionnaire , behavioral , neuro-scientific , psycho-physiological index anxiety self-control . The propose study innovative potential lead effective cost-efficient type intervention application future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty participant test approximately 5 cohort 10 . After individual first lab visit , participant cohort randomize two group : two experimental group . The experimental group subsequently attend group-based relaxation treatment base mindfulness meditation principle . After intervention , one experimental group use biofeedback device next two week , whereas experimental group . To control attention effect cue message biofeedback device sends , No-Biofeedback group receive text regular interval , however , tie individual 's physiology . To control amount attention waitlist group , lab visit arrange subject receive general information anxiety practical treatment advice exercise . During lab session , participant sign inform consent fill questionnaire . Questionnaires use : - Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Perceived Stress Scale - Patient Health Questionnaire - Sleep Scale Medical Outcomes Study - construct questionnaire social support ( family &amp; friend ) After , participant hook EEG Psychophysiological measure Stroop task ( identify color word ) . The design utilize 1 min congruent task , follow 2 minute relaxation period , 1 min in-congruent task , follow 2 min relaxation period , another 1 min congruent task , follow final 2 minute relaxation period . After , participant deceive think give speech task front 5 evaluator . We , however , inform participant technical difficulty , result inability follow task , give 2 minute regulate physiology . Lab session , include set-up , take 45 minute . The lab procedures follow second lab visit , approximately , two week .</detailed_description>
