	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation , Safety Activity Study CDX-014 Patients With Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-014 antibody-drug conjugate bind protein call TIM-1 , find high percentage kidney cancer cell tumor . The study enroll patient advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma determine safety efficacy CDX-014 . Eligible patient enroll dose-escalation portion study assign one several level CDX-014 . The first phase study test safety profile CDX-014 determine dose CDX-014 study Phase II portion study . During Phase II , 25 patient enrol receive recommend Phase II dose CDX-014 . All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
