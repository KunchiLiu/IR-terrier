	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , , high dose study drug nivolumab cause unacceptable side effect , combination treatment nivolumab yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ( Y-90 ) . Also , evaluate efficacy ( effect drug tumor ) tolerability ( effect drug body ) nivolumab , give standard care Y-90 ( Therasphere ) . Nivolumab currently Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve cancer , yet investigate advanced refractory hepatocellular carcinoma . Nivolumab antibody ( human protein stick part tumor and/or immune cell ) design allow body 's immune system work tumor cell . Y-90 currently FDA approve treatment hepatocellular carcinoma , yet investigate combination nivolumab disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify MTD nivolumab combination treatment nivolumab Y-90 population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proportion patient objective response rate ( ORR ) ( accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) combination treatment nivolumab Y-90 . II . To evaluate proportion patient alive progression free 24 week describe population . III . To evaluate toxicity ( accord National Comprehensive Cancer Network [ NCCN ] Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version ( v ) 4.03 ) tolerability nivolumab Y-90 patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma IV . To determine disease control rate ( DCR ) combination nivolumab Y-90 24 month start nivolumab treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) protein tumor cell expression level marker inflammatory/immune signature may include limited programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) , tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily , member 4 ( OX40 ) , cluster differentiation ( CD ) 73 , CD39 , T cell immunoglobulin T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-domain containing-3 ( TIM3 ) , glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor ( GITRL ) , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4 ) , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD45RO , forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) , granzyme immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and/or flow cytometry evaluate . II . Whole exome sequence computational analysis perform assess mutanome immunome ( subpopulation immune cell ) . III . Change clonal burden landscape various mutanome immunome analyze investigate correlation treatment response development resistance treatment . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study nivolumab follow phase Ib study . Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intraarterially ( IA ) . Approximately 4 week yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres treatment , nivolumab administer intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute every 2 week disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day last dose nivolumab 100 day discontinue study drug .</detailed_description>
