	<detailed_description>Our specific aim : 1 . Determine feasibility novel rehabilitation strategy provide University Michigan Scleroderma Clinic scleroderma patient upper extremity contracture . Investigators assess 3 main aspect process key success large study include proportion eligible people enroll study , rate adherence treatment protocol , time take conduct session include treatment outcome assessment completion . Based framework recommendation well-designed pilot study [ 1 ] , investigator set follow criterion success examine aspect : 1 . At least 50 % participant eligible study enroll . 2 . At least 80 % participant attend treatment session . 3 . The 3 session involve treatment outcome assessment last average 2 hour . 2 . Develop standardized treatment manual train therapist provide treatment patient . A standardized treatment manual therapist critical component need ensure consistency large multi-site trial . This manual draft use study refine need . 3 . Establish preliminary effect 8-week rehabilitation program improve arm function . Investigators hypothesize participant scleroderma significant improvement QuickDASH disability measure post test . Although investigator think large effect show , study allow u determine estimate effect variability power calculation multi-site trial .</detailed_description>
