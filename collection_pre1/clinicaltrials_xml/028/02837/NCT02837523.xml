	<detailed_description>Cystinosis rare , multisystem genetic disorder characterize accumulation amino acid call cystine different tissue organ body include kidney , eye , muscle , liver , pancreas brain . Generally , cystinosis break three different form know nephropathic cystinosis , intermediate cystinosis non-nephropathic ( ocular ) cystinosis . Nephropathic cystinosis present infancy common severe form . Early detection prompt treatment criticalin slow development progression symptom associate cystinosis . The kidney eye two organ often affect . Individuals nephro-pathic intermediate cystinosis ultimately require kidney transplant . Non-nephropathic cystinosis affect corneas eye . Cystinosis cause mutation CTNS gene inherit autosomal recessive disease . The specific symptoms severity cystinosis vary greatly one person another base upon several factor include age onset whether disorder promptly diagnose treat . The progression disorder slow early diagnosis treatment . Eventually , cystinosis affect tissue body . The age onset different symptom varies greatly . NEPHROPATHIC CYSTINOSIS ( renal Fanconi disease ) Nephropathic cystinosis frequent severe form cystinosis . The symptom nephropathic cystinosis usually become apparent within second half first year life . Specific symptom mild severe base upon individual case age treatment started.Growth failure renal Fanconi disease usually first noticeable complication disorder . Although infant appear normal birth , age one often fall third percentile height weight . In addition , affect infant may episodes vomiting , poor appetite , feed difficulty contribute ( along kidney dysfunction ) nutritional deficiency failure gain weight grow expect rate ( failure thrive ) . Ultimately , growth untreated child cystinosis occur 60 percent expect rate . Infants nephropathic cystinosis develop renal Fanconi disease , rare disorder characterize kidney dysfunction . The kidney tubule fail reabsorb variety need substance , include compound mention well amino acid , phosphate , calcium , glucose , carnitine , certain protein electrolyte . Consequently , affected individual abnormally low level many substance body . Symptoms renal Fanconi disease usually become apparent 6 12 month age may include excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) , excessive production passage urine ( polyuria ) , electrolyte imbalance , vomit , dehydration without fever . Dehydration severe case . Children nephropathic cystinosis may also develop symptom unrelated kidney ( extrarenal symptom ) . Again , find highly variable affected child develop symptom discuss . Specific extrarenal symptom vary greatly depend upon age treatment begin specific organ become involve ; organ include eye , bone marrow , liver , pancreas , spleen , intestine , brain , thyroid , muscle testis . At age , child may develop abnormal sensitivity light ( photophobia ) irritation due formation cystine crystal cornea . The severity photophobia vary.Affected child may also develop deficiency thyroid hormone production ( hypothyroidism ) due cystine crystal accumulate thyroid . The thyroid butterfly shape gland locate base neck . The thyroid secretes hormone bloodstream influence certain activity body growth , maturation rate metabolism . Symptoms hypothyroidism highly variable , may include fatigue , feel cold , dry skin , constipation depression . Children nephropathic cystinosis produce tear , sweat salivate normally . Tear production may diminish cause eye dry . An impaired ability sweat potentially cause total exhaustion collapse due heat ( heat prostration ) . The increased longevity individual nephropathic cystinosis reveal additional complication affect organ kidney occur later life . These complication develop due chronic accumulation cystine crystal individual adequately treat cysteamine , although undergone kidney transplant . These additional complication generally develop 20 40 year age . Accumulation cystine muscle tissue cause muscle disease ( myopathy ) lead progressive weakness waste affected muscle . Impairment muscle throat lead swallow feeding difficulty . Involvement chest muscle result pulmonary insufficiency.A wide variety gastrointestinal symptom develop include enlargement liver ( hepatomegaly ) cause high blood pressure main vein liver ( portal hypertension ) , enlargement spleen ( splenomegaly ) , gastroesophageal reflux , ulcer , inflammation esophagus ( esophagitis ) , dysfunction muscle gastrointestinal tract ( dysmotility ) . Additional symptom include inflammatory bowel disease , tear bowel cause content intestine flow abdominal cavity ( bowel perforation ) , inflammation peritoneum ( peritonitis ) , membrane line abdominal wall organ . Additional finding include metabolic bone disease inability properly digest food due lack digestive enzyme normally produce pancreas ( pancreatic exocrine insufficiency ) . Adults cystinosis may also develop abnormality affect eye include spasms eyelid ( blepharospasm ) , band keratopathy pigmentary retinopathy . Band keratopathy refers accumulation calcium deposit band across central surface cornea , cause pain decrease clarity vision ( visual acuity ) . Pigmentary retinopathy characterize progressive degeneration retina , thin layer nerve cell line inner surface back eyes . The retina sense light convert nerve signal , relay brain optic nerve . Pigmentary retinopathy impair night color vision , eventually , contribute overall reduced clarity vision . Individuals nephropathic cystinosis appear high rate diabetes general population destruction pancreas cystine accumulation . INTERMEDIATE CYSTINOSIS Also know nephropathic juvenile cystinosis adolescent cystinosis , form cystinosis characterize sign symptom nephropathic cystinosis described . However , onset symptoms occur later perhaps around 8 year age . Generally , symptoms less severe classical infantile nephropathic form slow progression . If untreated , endstage renal failure intermediate cystinosis usually develop point 15 25 year age . There spectrum disease severity cystinosis , overlap infantile intermediate form . NON-NEPHROPATHIC CYSTINOSIS Also know ocular `` benign '' cystinosis , form usually affect adult 's middle age ; call adult cystinosis . Kidney disease occur individual . The disorder appear affect eye . Untreated individual non-nephropathic cystinosis eventually develop photophobia due cystine crystal accumulation eyes.New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
