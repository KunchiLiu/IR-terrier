	<brief_title>Conventional Intubation Versus VivaSight™-SL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Airway management critically ill patient usually perform endotracheal intubation direct laryngoscopy . [ 1 , 2 ] However , show videolaryngoscopy may superior conventional approach intensive care , i. e. number attempt successful intubation rate accidental esophageal intubation low visualization vocal chord improve . [ 3 , 4 ] Recently , endotracheal tube integrate camera tip introduce permit continuous visualization tube 's insertion trachea monitor connect camera ( VivaSightTM-SL , ETView Ltd. , Misgav , Israel ) [ 5 ] . This tube CE FDA certify ( http : //www.etview.com/products/vivasight-sl ) . It possible observe passage tube vocal chord intubation verify correct placement visualization tracheal cartilage . This advantage videolaryngoscopy , camera mount laryngoscope blade . For VivaSightTM-SL tube , decrease time intubation increase first attempt success show conventional intubation simulator trial . [ 6 ] In study , VivaSightTM-SL tube test conventional approach elective urgent intubation critically ill patient . Methods Study design : randomize , prospective trial Sample size : n = 54 With sample size 54 ( randomize 1:1 2x 27 ) difference 35 % first attempt success conventional intubation may detect α-error 0,05 β-error 1-0,8 . Duration study : sample size reach 18 month begin study Procedures : - screening patient study inclusion accord inclusion exclusion criterion - conventional endotracheal intubation direct laryngoscopy - endotracheal intubation VivaSightTM-SL tube study inclusion : All patient treat Dept . Intensive Care Medicine receive percutaneous tracheotomy due long term ventilation screen accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Details study related procedure : Intubation : The Intubation VivaSightTM-SL endotracheal tube differ intubation conventional tube do respect standard operate procedure ( SOP ) Dept . Intensive Care Medicine . Additionally , intubation guide camera mount tip tube . During intubation , vital parameter monitor respect underlying disease patient ' therapy continuously adjust . According SOP , two physician present least one fellow attend physician experience intensive care medicine . In trial , intubation do exclusively fellow attend physician . Consent : patient legal surrogate give write informed consent . Data protection : Data anonymized .</detailed_description>
