	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tendinopathy ( RCT ) frequent cause shoulder pain . RCT frequently term impingement syndrome , base underlie mechanism subacromial space soft tissue ( subacromial bursa , rotator cuff tendon long head biceps tendon ) get encroach coracoacromial arch arm elevate . RCT contribute decrease quality life function , induce work incapacity sleep disorder . Exercises , conservative management , show effective increase function decrease pain related RCT . However , lack study compare different type exercise ( i.e . concentric , eccentric , scapular strengthening , proprioceptive , coactivation ) report many systematic review . One type exercise , coactivation strengthening , could efficient . Coactivation strengthen implies recruitment pectoralis major latissimus dorsi perform regular strengthening . When thesis muscle recruit , medio-inferior orientation tendon create force vector limit superior translation humeral head , thus limit subacromial narrowing . The aim study evaluate efficacy coactivation strengthen exercise patient RCT compare regular strengthening exercise . Forty-two participant diagnose RCT orthopaedic surgeon follow standardize protocol randomise either coactivation regular strengthening exercise . Participants perform 6-week exercise protocol . Outcomes measure baseline , three , six , 12 , 18 24 week . The primary outcome function assess Disabilities arm , shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire . Secondary outcome focus pain ( visual analog scale ) , quality life ( Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index ) , impression change ( Patient Global Impression Change ) , subacromial distance ( ultrasonography ) muscular strength ( manual dynamometer ) . Investigators expect coactivation strengthen exercise efficient short long term . This trial provide data guide clinician treatment RCT reduce recovery time bring patient back quickly possible work usual function .</brief_summary>
