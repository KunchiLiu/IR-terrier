	<brief_title>Effectiveness RF Sponge Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Retained surgical item ( e.g . sponge , needle , instrument ) remain one sentinel event frequently report The Joint Commission , estimate occur 1 : 5500 surgery . These serious adverse event result negative patient outcome ( reoperation , readmission/prolonged hospital stay , infection sepsis , fistulas/ bowel obstruction , visceral perforation , death ) . Cotton gauze sponge account 48-69 % retain surgical item , result serious tissue reaction metal item . The national standard prevention retain surgical sponge relies heavily manual counting , process occur prior incision , time closing cavity within cavity , close first layer tissue , close skin . The immediate outcome closing count either correct unresolved . If unresolved , series step take reconcile count ( surgeon notify , wound search , sterile field search , room search , count repeat ) . These step require extra time effort , pull personnel away compete priority . If final closing count remain incorrect , common practice obtain intraoperative radiograph rule retention surgical sponge . The practice search misplace sponge use radiography rule presence retain sponge extend operating time add cost associate care patient surgery . Novel technology available detect preventing retain surgical sponge . The technology use radiofrequency ( RF ) chip sponge , mat wand scan patient sponge . Only one clinical trial evaluate in-use effectiveness RF technology . No retained sponge occur 18 month trial . However sample size large enough determine significance . Primary Objective : The objective Health Services Research evaluate in-use effectiveness radiofrequency ( RF ) surgical sponge detection system reduce cost searching sponge prevention incorrect count . Specific Aims : 1 . To compare estimated time cost search sponge use radiography rule presence retain sponge implementation RF sponge detection system . 2 . To compare incidence incorrect final closing count implementation RF sponge detection system . Study Design : Using deidentified exist data , investigator propose quasiexperimental study evaluate outcome use RF surgical sponge detection system . The set University Iowa Hospitals Clinics , 711-bed academic medical center , Level 1 trauma center , locate Iowa City , Iowa . The University Iowa Institutional Review Board determine study meet regulatory definition human subject research . Primary Endpoints 1 . The estimated time cost search sponge use radiography rule presence retain surgical sponge . 2 . The frequency incorrect final closing sponge count . Data individual patient record circulate nurse questionnaire embed surgical log Epic Systems® , module Optime® . The questionnaire consist three individual count : initial closing , final closing , additional count . If first question , `` search require '' answer `` yes '' , four subsequent question ask : type sponge , action take , number minute require , location sponge find . Data retrieve Health Information System ( HIS ) use S.A.P . ® Business Objects™ ( surgical volume , surgical service ) Crystal report ( detail search sponge ) . Incorrect final closing count document Patient Safety Net® electronic event reporting system . Data retrieve event report within category `` count incomplete do '' `` count incorrect '' . Data retrieve HIS personnel provide via report Director Clinical Functions responsible Main Operating Room . This report part quality improvement program . Electronic data store College Nursing , University Iowa , college 's secure server . Data clean data manager analyze college 's statistician . Analysis : Aim 1 : Minutes time spend search misplace sponge analyze use range , mean , standard deviation . Comparison implementation RF detection technology describe percentage analyze use chi square Yates correction . To provide best estimate resource use search sponge , investigator use publish data operating room cost per minute estimate search cost ( $ 17.23 ) . However , significant difference across institution . To accommodate broad range potential adopter RF detection technology show differences potential cost-effectiveness , addition use average estimate operating room time cost literature , investigator construct low bound upper bound estimate operate room time cost provide range cost estimate use assess RF detection technology intervention . Investigators adjust search cost variation practice search . At time surgeon continue procedure ( e.g . closing wound ) case surgeon assist effort locate sponge . As investigator interested time spend non-productive search , investigator use range estimate non-productive search cost . Investigators start 100 % non-productive also estimate base 75 % non-productive ( 25 % search time move forward procedure ) 50 % non-productive ( 50 % search time move forward procedure ) . Investigators use average radiography cost publish literature ( $ 286 ) addition operate room time associate obtain intraoperative radiograph ( 30minutes ) . All time cost analyze use range , mean , standard deviation . Comparison implementation RF detection technology describe percentage analyze use chi square Yates correction . Aim 2 : To compare incidence incorrect final closing count The number incorrect final closing count implementation RF sponge detection system analyze use range , mean , standard deviation . Comparison implementation RF detection technology describe percentage analyze use chi square Yates correction .</detailed_description>
