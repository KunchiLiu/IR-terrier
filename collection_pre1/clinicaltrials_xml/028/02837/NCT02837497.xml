	<detailed_description>Pediatric cardiac arrest affect thousand hospitalize child year . Progressive heart lung failure predispose cause majority event . While cardiac arrest survival outcomes improve last decade , half child live hospital discharge . As brain injury complicates care survive , burden child public 's health substantial . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) - medical procedure provide chest compression ventilation cardiac arrest - life saving , high quality CPR effective . However , provide high quality care resuscitation child difficult . Attempts improve care conventional training method successful ; therefore , intervention improve quality pediatric CPR outcome need . The objective study determine novel resuscitation care improvement bundle improve outcomes single center intensive care unit ( ICU ) efficacy study generalizable pediatric institution multi-center effectiveness trial . The ICU-Resuscitation ( ICU-RESUS ) bundle include : 1 ) CPR train point-of-care ( ICU rather classroom away patient ) ; 2 ) interdisciplinary structure review cardiac arrest emphasize patient-centric physiology intend optimize intra-arrest post-arrest care . The ICU-RESUS bundle substantially improve CPR quality nearly double number child survive event single center efficacy trial . In study , multi-institutional parallel stepped-wedge hybrid cluster-randomized trial , leverage exist infrastructure National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) -funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ( CPCCRN ) , propose follow aim : 1 ) Evaluate effectiveness ICU-RESUS interventional bundle improve outcome child treat ICU cardiac arrest ; 2 ) Evaluate effectiveness ICU-RESUS interventional bundle improve quality CPR provide ICU healthcare provider population child treat ICU cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
