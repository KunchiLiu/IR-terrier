	<brief_summary>Background Peripheral nerve block use USG allow visualisation structure nerve make block administration safe , quick comfortable . However publication concern minimum local anesthetic volume capable providing block . In study investigastors aim find Minimum Effective Volume Of Local Anesthetic For Ultrasound-Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block hand , elbow forehand operation . Materials &amp; Methods A total 55 ASA I-II patient underwent hand surgery operation administer USG guided-axillary brachial plexus blockage include study . Ulnar , median radial nerve see minimum effective local anesthetic volume investigate start total 21 ml % 0.5 bupivacain . After accomplish blockage , volume decrease 0.5 nerve . Block administration time , block onset time , anesthesia time time first analgesic requirement record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Matherials Method This randomize , prospective , double-blinded , single-center study conduct accordance recent version Helsinki Declaration . Approval study grant Ankara Numune Research Training Hospital Ethics Committee . A total 55 adult patient classified American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I-II , undergo elective , forearm , wrist hand surgery recruit trial . Written inform consent obtain patient . Exclusion criteria patient coagulopathy , local anesthetic allergy , local infection , significant neurological , pysychiatric congnitive disorder , chronic analgesic use , know neuropathy , infection injection site unwillingness patient . After arrival operating room , 20-gauge intravenous catheter place contralateral forearm . Standard monitoring use throughout procedure , include non-invasive arterial blood pressure , heart rate , pulse oximetry . Patients divide group accord order arrival five-person group create . İnitial volume 7 ml . Per nerve ( ulnar , median , radial ) , totaly 21 ml local anesthetic administer first group ( first five patient ) . İf success rate block three group , volume reduce next group 0.5 ml nerve . success rate less three group , study end . And minimum effective volume calculate statistically . Block prosedures All brachial plexus block perform anesthesiologist . The patient make comfortable supine position arm abduct elbow flexed 90 degree . After skin probe preparation , A linear US probe ( HFL 38 , 6-13MHz ) place transverse plane lateral border pectoralis major muscle obtain best view brachial plexus . Image quality optimise selection appropriate depth ( within 2 cm ) , focus range ( within 1cm ) gain . The structures interest superficial pulsate axillary artery localise within 1 cm . Surrounding axillary artery , one find three four terminal branch brachial plexus : median ( superficial lateral artery ) , ulnar ( superficial medial artery ) radial ( posterior lateral medial artery ) nerve . A 5 cm needle ( 21G , Locoplex , Vygon , Ecouen , France ) insert parallel long axis transducer lateral side . As needle plane ultrasound beam , path advancement visualise real time needle approach target nerve . Ideally , radial nerve target first , lie posterior artery , order prevent displace structure interest deeper obscure median ulnar nerve . The musculocutaneous nerve block separately outside neurovascular bundle 3 ml % 0.5 bupivacaine patient . We also worry nerve puncture intraneural injection . In addition , also confirm location needle tip hypoechoic area injection . For safety , inject 0.5 ml local anesthetic test dose . If patient complain paresthesia pain , injection pressure high , spread local anesthetic visualized , investigastors stop injection , withdraw needle try . The investigastors regard paresthesia pain , high injection pressure intraneural injection . The investigator test block n't know dose . Sensory block evaluate nerve distribution use ice test cold sensation , compare anaesthetize arm contralateral arm , grade three-point scale ( 0 , difference side ; 1 , difference arm cold still sense blocked arm ; 2 , cold sensation block arm ) . Motor block nerve evaluate ask patient extend flex arm wrist ( radial nerve ) , flex wrist oppose second third finger thumb ( median nerve ) , flex oppose fifth finger towards thumb ( ulnar nerve ) grade 0 , change ; 1 , reduce contraction ; 2 , contraction . Data collect every 5 min first 60 min , 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,18,24 hour . motor sensory scale , total value high 10 , surgical anesthesia consider unsuccessful . sensitive block score must least five . VAS determination perform scale number 0 10 cm . 1mg/kg tramadol 15 mg/kg paracetamol IV infusion administer patient reequirement additional analgesia ( VAS ≥ 4 ) . The total number patient require additional analgesic drug note . During initial procedure , operation postoperatively , patient satisfaction evaluate poor ( 1 ) , moderate ( 2 ) , good ( 3 ) good ( 4 ) . Statical Analysis Statistical analysis apply use SPSS 19.0 statistical software.our sample size calculation method dixon massey method . According account , n = 2 ( SD / SEM ) ² ; n : sample size , SD ( standard deviation ) : The standard deviation , SEM ( standard error mean ) calculate standard error mean ( SD = 5 mL , SEM = 1.0 mL ) n find 50 patient . For aplicational error add 5 patient ( % 10 ) . A total 55 patient include study . The sample size calculation , make G * Power 3.0.10 statistical software package ( effect size ( effect size ) = 0.4 , α = 0.05 , degree freedom ( df ) = 48 0.85 power ( power ( 1- β ) ) , number 50 patient find adequate . However practical magnification error sample 10 % 55 patient include study .</detailed_description>
