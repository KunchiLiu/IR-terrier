	<brief_title>Hypnosis Efficacy Prevention Anxiety During Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The coronary angiography medical imaging acquisition use cardiology highlight coronary artery coronary disease suspicion . According expert consensus perform local anesthesia . Indeed examination quite painless , apart initial arterial puncture . Moreover , patient chest pain must detect examination locate guilty coronary injury . This possible patient general anesthesia . But , general anesthesia may source anxiety patient , technique painful several time : puncture , exploration probe winding , spastic over-calcified artery , even dilation balloon swell obstructs downstream artery . The efficiency evaluation hypnosis make INSERM 2015 conclude `` use hypnosis surgical practice medical interventional radiological act allow reduce consumption sedative drug and/or pain medication preoperatively '' . The study hypothesis , hypnosis contribute decrease anxiety pain patient undergoing coronary angiography , even decrease complication due good control hemodynamic ( heart rate blood pressure ) . It could entail good comfort operator coronary angiography . Primary objective : To compare initial anxiety state coronary angiographic perform schedule adult earlier coronary angiography , accord undergo hypnotic session examination , posthypnotic suggestion self-hypnosis make coronary angiography . Secondary objective : To compare two group patient : - pain coronary angiography - hemodynamic factor heart rate , blood pressure examination - operator comfort - use sedative drug , pain medication local anesthesia - outbreak major minor complication Primary endpoint : Anxiety measure use self-report questionnaire ( STAI-Y-A ) , coronary angiography Secondary endpoint : Trait anxiety ( STAI-Y-B questionnaire ) State anxiety eve coronary angiography Pain coronary angiography : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) Heart rate blood pressure coronary angiography Comfort operator angiography : Likert scale 5 point ( 1 : bad comfort , 5 : best possible comfort ) Dose sedative drug , pain medication local anesthesia inject coronary angiography Outbreak major complication coronary angiography ( death , stroke , tamponade , hemorrhagic shock , anaphylactic shock image tracer , ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation , severe bradycardia ) minor complication ( vagal reaction , hematoma puncture point , skin allergy ) Methodology : Efficiency comparative study , randomize , simple-blind ( angiography operator blind ) , single center , routine clinical care Only one medical check per patient Procedures : When patient take cardiology department eve schedule coronary angiography , cardiologist purpose take part study . If accept , first evaluation anxiety ( trait state ) perform . The following day , go coronary angiography room , patient splitted randomly two group : - A group patient undergo hypnotic session examination posthypnotic suggestion self-hypnosis perform angiography . A medical prescription anxiolytic make accord patient clinical sign anxiety - Another group become prescription anxiolytic accord patient clinical sign anxiety . The State Anxiety measure set patient coronary angiography room , perform examination . The pain hemodynamic factor measure coronary angiography . The comfort operator evaluate . The patient contact phone one month coronary angiography evaluate satisfaction medical care . Patients number : Assuming control group mean score 50 ( standard deviation 10 ) STAI-Y A , clinically significant difference ( 5 point ) , 85 patient must include group , totally 170 patient . Trial Duration : Expected study start : first semester 2016 Inclusion duration : 12 month Duration per patient : 1 mois Total study duration : 18 month ( include data analysis et report result ) Statistical Analysis : - Primary objective : comparison mean score STAI-Y A two group ( T test Student ) , adjustment potential factor confusion ( multiple linear regression ) - Secondary objective : comparison quantitative criterion ( T test Student ) qualitative criterion ( Fischer 's exact test ) two group . Expected Benefits : Since coronary angiography invasive procedure without general anesthesia affect noble organ , procedure could anxiogenic even psychologically traumatic emergency . Not practice general anesthesia prevent potential risk patient , anxiety , non-comfort pain exist . We think hypnosis could improve patient care psychologically physically invasive procedure . In case , few sedative drug pain medication necessary , would decrease potential iatrogenesis , patient care improve . It alternative patient decrease drug consumption . Quality Assurance Plan : Data record Paper Case Report medical record . The patient undergo one medical examination study . No follow-up expect .</detailed_description>
