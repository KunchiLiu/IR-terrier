	<brief_title>Biological Clinical Database Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer represent fifth cause death cancer Western country . In 90 % case , due adenocarcinoma . The curative treatment pancreatic cancer remain surgical exeresis . This one suggest curative treatment 10 15 % case . Besides , prevention screen impossible due absence clearly identify risk factor group absence useful marker diagnosis clinical practice . The research effort area must face double challenge : saving time improve diagnosis period strengthen therapeutic equipment . It important identify characterise new molecular marker applicable good diagnosis and/or treatment ( especially response factor chemotherapy ) . The present project aim create multicentre national network use set clinical biological base ( CBB ) dedicate pancreatic adenocarcinoma , build best quality standard , biological resource well associate clinical epidemiological data . The originality CBB rely fact tumour tissue sample surgical specimen resectable tumour also cell biopsy material unresectable and/or metastatic tumour sample endoscopic ultrasonography ( 1500 biopsies 3 year couple systematic blood sample ) . Endoscopic ultrasonography technique use specifically perform biopsy pancreatic tumour obtain useful cell material research . To sample associate every clinical epidemiological target data require research project relate unique CBB France . From sample , DNA RNA especially isolate , precious biological material program molecular analysis . There many stake : create French network order form , prospective plan 3 year , collection tissue , biopsy , nucleic acid pancreatic cancer associate circulate blood sample relevant clinical data . Thanks collection , investigator team hope able identify new molecular marker ( cancer tissue and/or circulate blood pancreatic cancer patient ) applicable clinical practice diagnose , assess prognosis predict response pancreatic cancer chemotherapy . The investigator team also try identify new risk factor cancer , especially regard diet . The base thus make 12 different French centre University Hospital private Centres gastroenterologist , oncologist , digestive surgeon , anatomopathologists , epidemiologist intervene associate scientific team dedicate pancreatic cancer , already form collaborative network . Investigators hope project : get unique exceptional CBB pancreatic cancer , reach require standard ( especially Inca ) CBB , internationally recognise . This base strong guarantee identify new molecular marker diagnosis , prognosis , predictive response chemotherapy pancreatic cancer , especially locally advanced . Finally , epidemiological project relate project originally nutritional issue ( regardless lipid diet cachexia ) associate pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
