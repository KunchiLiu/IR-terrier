	<brief_summary>This research do investigate fecal microbiome metabolome well serum analytes single nucleotide polymorphisms Olympic athletes comparison elite athlete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stool Microbiome , Pathogens , Infectious Agents Among Olympic Elite Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Olympic athlete , non-Olympic elite athlete , active adult may genetic metabolic profile unique . These profile may contribute caliber athletic performance , may provide key understand select genetic metabolic condition . Therefore , specific aim project follow : - Specific Aim 1 : Characterize fecal microbial community athletes participate summer 2016 game athletes participate Olympic game - Specific Aim 2 : Characterize fecal microbiome metabolome ( untargeted ) athletes participate summer 2016 game athletes participate Olympic game - Specific Aim 3 : Characterize select serum analytes single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) elite athlete participate Summer 2016 game athletes participate Olympic game , via serum saliva analysis , respectively - Specific Aim 4 : Retain specimen Olympic athletes participate summer 2016 game athletes participate Olympic game future research - Specific Aim 7 : Examine presence Zika virus RNA study participant exhibit symptoms Stool , urine , blood specimen collect study stool metabolome , well serum analytes single nucleotide polymorphism , nature extent exposure pathogens infectious agent . These compare Olympic athletes non-Olympic elite athlete .</detailed_description>
