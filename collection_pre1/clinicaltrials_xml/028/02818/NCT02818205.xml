	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore feasibility detect physiological pattern arousal sensory input child without Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Accordingly , two question direct methodological research investigation : ( 1 ) Is relationship rest ( tonic ) response ( phasic ) pattern arousal among typically develop child child ASD ? , ( 2 ) Is difference EDA response sensation typically develop child child ASD ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This methodological research design prospective exploratory test-retest design assess relationship tonic phasic Electrodermal Activity ( EDA ) variable . EDA rest response variety sensation measure use skin conductance . Descriptive statistic summarize EDA dependent variable data use skin conductance response ( SCR ) magnitude , SCR amplitude , skin conductance level ( SCL ) , non-specific response ( NSR ) habituation ( HAB ) . The data use ass relationship tonic phasic pattern arousal compare response pattern group use Sensory Challenge Protocol ( SCP ) child ASD typically develop child ( TD ) .</detailed_description>
