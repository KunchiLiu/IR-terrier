	<brief_summary>Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART , HIV medication ) dramatically increase expect lifespan HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) infect patient ; yet , risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , heart attack stroke , increased population . This increase risk may link persistent inflammation activation immune system . Although relationship cardiovascular disease HIV-infected individual take HIV medication well understood , team researcher involve study observe diet rich soy , level recommend FDA ( Federal Drug Administration ) , improve cholesterol level inflammation individual infect HIV . From study , researcher hope gain understanding dietary soy impact HIV-infected individual take HIV medication . Two pretzel without soy develop OSU ( Ohio State University ) Department Food Science Technology use previous clinical trial use investigate pretzel snack affect cardiovascular disease risk , immunity , body break naturally occur chemical soy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study significantly advance knowledge dietary soy impact lipid level composition , metabolic parameter inflammation HIV+ patient treat anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) . HIV+ person increase risk CVD , HIV ART associate metabolic perturbation ( include lipid disturbance ) chronic inflammation . There grow recognition correct perturbation may improve life expectancy . Two clinical trial , first short-term single arm study , follow two arm , placebo control , crossover clinical trial , use address feasibility soy-based , functional food intervention impact intervention metabolic immunomodulatory parameter . Daily pretzel dose two packet determine prior clinical trial soy bread patient prostate cancer . The use food-based delivery vehicle many advantage compare use dietary supplement provide strategy deliver complexity bioactive compound find whole food ingredient . We hypothesize soy pretzel formulation well tolerated excellent adherence ( &gt; 95 % ) among ART-treated HIV+ patient moderate hypercholesterolemia . The short-term dose confirmation study ( n=20 ) 10 week study use single intervention single dose soy pretzel determine Grade 1 2 toxicity , compliance , tolerability soy pretzel ART-treated HIV+ patient moderate hypercholesterolemia . Once , confirm short-term feasibility soy pretzel , subsequent longer-term study involve 28 week randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover trial ( n=80 ) soy wheat ( placebo ) pretzel . Overall , short-term dose confirmation study provide necessary clinical data require move intervention forward long-term placebo control trial . Both study provide u valuable biologic material ass change cardiovascular immune biomarkers relevant ART-treated HIV+ patient facilitate future large-scale study investigate individual difference soy isoflavone metabolism within patient population . Specifically , short-term dose confirmation study include participant screen meet eligibility determine use result 12 hr fast lipid panel include total cholesterol ( TC ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , triglycerides ; health history ; 2013 American College Cardiology/ American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) Guidelines cardiovascular risk calculator . Eligible participant enrol instructed follow legume-free diet ( avoid bean , soy bean , lentil , bean sprout , peanut ) two week , abstain vitamin dietary supplement , follow provide standardized multivitamin regimen . Participants return clinic fasting blood collection submit 24 hour urine collection week 0 . At end visit , participant instruct consume one packet ( 10 piece ) soy pretzel twice daily continue follow legume-free diet provide multivitamin regimen . Participants return 4 week obtain second month 's supply study agent . Subjects return second 4 week fast blood collection submit complete 24 hr urine collection . The subsequent placebo control study include criterion use earlier short-term study . Participants randomize either soy pretzel intervention ( 1 packet pretzel twice/day : total 20 piece deliver 24g soy protein ~60mg isoflavones ) wheat pretzel intervention ( placebo , 1 packet pretzel twice/day : total 20 piece contain 0g soy protein 0mg isoflavones ) 12 week cross pretzel intervention second 12 week . A two-week washout period involve legume-free diet standardize multivitamin regimen , similar short-term study , precede intervention period . Blood 24-hour urine collect specified time point evaluate sustain effect soy pretzel intervention biomarkers cardiovascular risk , immune function , metabolites isoflavone intervention . This study address innovative approach utilize dietary soy snack food reduce cardiac risk explore multiple driver immune activation HIV disease ( pro-inflammatory lipid , microbial translocation , cytokine induce ) increase likelihood generate result impact clinically relevant index HIV disease progression .</detailed_description>
