	<brief_title>Diagnostic Utility MRI Female Patients With Nipple Discharge : A Prospective Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Study : The purpose prospective study determine diagnostic value Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) evaluation patient pathologic nipple discharge . Background &amp; Significance : Nipple discharge , one common reason referral breast imaging service , often investigate diagnostic mammography sonography evaluate underlying malignancy , report incidence range 3 29 % . If conventional image negative , patient may obtain image MRI , undergo ductography ductoscopy , proceed duct exploration excision , observe . Findings breast MRI , addition patient 's symptomatology ( frequency volume discharge ) risk breast cancer , use inform decision whether pursue surgery watchful waiting . Limited research suggest MRI may role evaluation patient nipple discharge ability identify mammographically- sonographically-occult disease guide surgical excision . Previous research drawn conclusion small retrospective patient cohort , relatively wide variability report diagnostic utility MRI . Consequently , duct exploration excision remain gold standard diagnostic approach . However , duct excision invasive procedure technically challenging , especially affected duct localize intraductal lesion locate far posteriorly breast , result complication , interruption neurovascular supply nipple-areolar complex , cosmetic deformity , breastfeed limitation . Many woman nipple discharge negative conventional image workup undergo surgical excision , actually underlying malignancy . MRI may useful improve patient selection setting ; particular , high negative predictive value MRI may obviate need invasive surgery patient require intervention symptomatic relief . Our research group previously perform retrospective study topic , currently review publication . The negative predictive value MRI find 100 % , study significantly limited selection bias ; , certain patient , discretion breast surgeon , underwent MRI part workup . The purpose propose prospective study determine diagnostic value MRI evaluation patient pathologic nipple discharge . Design &amp; Procedures : Referral breast MRI patient pathological nipple discharge change recent year . Discussion breast surgeon indicate referral breast MRI become routine patient present pathological nipple discharge past , referral discretion breast surgeon . For study , patient pathologic nipple discharge ( unilateral bloody unilateral clear ) identify either surgery clinic presenting symptom breast image clinic one 2 way : 1 ) requisition `` indication exam '' specify refer clinician , 2 ) technologist ask routine question patient . These patient undergo conventional imaging mammography breast sonography first . If conventional image negative non-diagnostic , patient see surgical clinic ( Clinic 2-2 next door ) contrast-enhanced breast MRI order surgeon part clinical care . All patient see breast surgeon first approach study . Once patient identify plan contrast MRI , approach Clinical Research Coordinator ( CRC ) resident/fellow participate study . Our experience , base prior retrospective nipple discharge study , show approximately 100 patient per year encounter breast image clinic evaluation nipple discharge . It expect approximately 75 % agree participate study . This yield recruitment rate 75 patient per year , hence number specify study proposal . Bracco Diagnostics provide seed funding 2 year anticipate total 150 patient . Data acquire prospectively patient receive MRI 's clinical purpose ( symptoms pathological nipple discharge ) . When clinical team notifies study team MRI order purpose , study team consent patient document result follow-up . MRI 's obtained patient 's research purpose . For reason , clinical guideline obtain creatinine , pregnancy test , etc follow . The following data collect analyzed : patient age , characteristic discharge ( laterality , spontaneous versus express , duration time , color , presence blood ) , image workup finding , Breast Imaging-Reporting Data Systems ( BI-RADS ) final assessment category , pathology result core biopsy and/or surgical excision , clinical radiologic follow-up data two year presentation . Selection Subjects : See detailed paragraph . Inclusion criterion : female patient unilateral bloody nipple discharge OR unilateral clear nipple discharge ; clinical decision contrast enhance MRI . Exclusion criterion : male gender , non-English speaker , age &lt; 21 year , lack capacity give legally effective consent Note : It highly unusual lactating patient present pathologic discharge therefore likely identify study . There small potential risk associate absorption contrast medium breast milk , insufficient evidence exclude woman currently lactate study . Note : The cost MRI cover insurance . In unlikely event patient 's insurance deny coverage , patient exclude study . Subject Recruitment &amp; Compensation : The patient see surgical clinic ( Clinic 2-2 next door ) contrast-enhanced breast MRI order surgeon . Potential subject contact introduce study designate Clinical Research Coordinator resident/fellow participate project . Recruitment begin approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) conclude recruitment approximately 150 subject . No financial compensation subject provide . Consent Process : Please see Section 14 e-IRB submission form . Subject 's Capacity Give Legally Effective Consent : Subjects capacity give legally effective consent include study . Study Interventions : Patients choose participate trial undergone mammography , breast sonography , plan contrast-enhanced breast MRI evaluation nipple discharge . The study intervention collection clinical data research purpose . Risk/Benefit Assessment : Participation study pose minimal risk patient . Risks subject include loss confidentiality . Loss confidentiality unlikely study data store Principal Investigator 's ( PI 's ) office share drive . There direct benefit subject ; however , research may help improve diagnostic workup nipple discharge future patient . Costs Subject : There cost subject result study . The cost MRI cover insurance . No financial compensation provide . Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations : As discuss , high negative predictive value MRI may obviate need invasive surgery patient require intervention symptomatic relief . Based statistical consultation Dr. Kingshuk Roy Choudhary , negative predictive value MRI 95 % margin error +/- 4.3 % achieve 100 subject recruit . The goal recruit approximately 150 subject , expectation patient receive adequate two-year follow-up . The following data collect analyzed : patient age , characteristic discharge ( laterality , spontaneous versus express , duration time , color , presence blood ) , image workup finding , BI-RADS final assessment category , pathology result core biopsy and/or surgical excision , clinical radiologic follow-up data two year presentation . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) MRI detection malignancy calculate use standard formula . MRIs classify BI-RADS category 4 5 consider `` positive , '' classify BI-RADS category 1 , 2 , 3 consider `` negative . '' For purpose analysis , MRI consider `` false positive '' image biopsied and/or excise lesion reveal malignancy . MRI consider `` false negative '' image suspicious find imaging ( BI-RADS 1 , 2 , 3 ) subsequent pathology reveals malignancy . 13 . Data &amp; Safety Monitoring : Consent form store PI 's office . Patient names medical record number record database share drive accessible study researcher . Once data collection complete , identifier discard . Only basic demographic information ( age ) retain .</detailed_description>
