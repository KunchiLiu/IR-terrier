	<brief_title>The Oral Accessibility Spatula ( Spatule SAB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The oral examination people behavioural handicap seem difficult . Those patient react defensive reflex limit spontaneously amplitude oral cavity prevent keep open mouth sufficient time process examination . This difficulty cause various reason : cerebral motor disability , behavioral trouble mental disability , affect people age . The current method keep open mouth like wedge often unsuitable patient . Moreover , device exists describe even literature . An innovative medical device develop , order offer disable patient users dentist comfort oral-dental examination . The oral accessibility spatula , make polypropylene plastic , design two part : - handle hold spatula user - thin plastic surface introduce mouth , dull round edge hole side lock spatula upper low teeth . Primary objective : To evaluate buccal access first oral-dental examination without oral accessibility spatula ( SAB ) . Secondary objective : To evaluate safe use SAB To evaluate tolerance exam without , SAB Primary endpoint : Visibility dental examination incisor-canine sector , premolar molar use probe , assess oral accessibility score determine base intra oral accessible area without oral accessibility Spatula device Secondary endpoint : The safety spatula assess analyze report adverse effect relative frequency The dental exam tolerance evaluation ; without Oral Accessibility .Spatula Methodology : Multi-center interventional prospective study , open-label Only one medical check per patient Procedures : Any patient behavioral handicap , consults dentist preventive check-up oral-dental curative act , examine inclusion operator check inclusion non-inclusion criterion , especially behavior Venham Scale ( patient score 2 high , mean opposing , approach toward oral cavity include ) . The oral accessibility score eligible patient perform twice , without SAB first , SAB . The incident and/or potential injury report standardized grid . Venham scale score measure second time oral-dental examination without spatula . Patients number : Without SAB , rate patient oral accessibility score least level 8 20 % . The protocol forecast hypothetically 20 % highering rate use SAB ( 40 % patient score 8 high ) . With total staff 140 patient , hypothesis validate Î± risk set 5 % statistical power 90 % . 200 patient expected order take account potential center effect potential investigator effect , study output rate 10 % . Trial Time : Only one medical check per patient , total duration go inclusion period 18 month . Expected study start : first semester 2016 End inclusion : second semester 2017 End study : second semester 2017 Statistical Analysis : The major analysis comparison oral accessibility score examination without SAB . Each patient control , examination always perform without SAB first , secondly SAB , dental surgeon . Expected Benefits : The expected result proof best examination quality risk patient . The major prospect availability SAB dental surgeon improve therapeutic indication quality examination , parent , carers caregiver , order make possible easy application oral-dental health suitable handicap disabled people . So , expect benefit : - early diagnostic oral-dental disease - improve efficiency tooth care - reduction use general anesthesia oral examination - help tooth wash order improve significantly oral-dental healthy level - improve prevention availability spatula parent , carers physician . Quality Assurance Plan : Data record Paper Case Report medical record . The patient undergo one medical examination study . No follow-up expect .</detailed_description>
