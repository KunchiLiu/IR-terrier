	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional , phase 2 clinical trial study two dos pembrolizumab administer prior surgery ( neoadjuvant therapy ) 4 dos administer surgery ( adjuvant therapy ) stage IB , II IIIA non-small cell lung cancer . Pembrolizumab type immunotherapy may enhance ability immune system fight cancer . The study investigate effect pembrolizumab immune system certain immune cell , call TILs ( tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ) , respond pembrolizumab . Previous study suggest pembrolizumab could alter immune cell way immune cell identify cancer cell . Pembrolizumab approve treatment advanced lung cancer , investigational setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presumed mechanism action pembrolizumab removal T lymphocyte inhibition mask PD-1 receptor . Our hypothesis mask PD-1 receptor pembrolizumab result activation proliferation T lymphocytes specificity tumor associate antigen ( TILs ) . In untreated lung cancer tumor , would expect tumor TIL cell specificities tumor associate antigen . Based response rate pembrolizumab advance lung cancer , hypothesize least 20 % lung cancer would TIL cell specificity tumor associate antigen pembrolizumab therapy . Studying neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy attractive strategy study immunologic change cause PD-1 ( program death receptor 1 ) checkpoint mask . Most immunologic activity associate pembrolizumab occur tumor surround microenvironment . Evaluation post-pembrolizumab tumor important understanding factor associate pembrolizumab activity , immune tolerance , discovery target immune therapy . Pembrolizumab known benefit non-small cell lung cancer . The addition pembrolizumab two dos prior surgery four dos surgery potential confer clinical benefit . Large randomized phase 3 trial test whether PD-1 checkpoint antibody improve survival adjuvant therapy resection early stage lung cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC . Clinical stage IB ( &gt; 4cm per CT ) , Stage IIA/IIB , Stage IIIA ( N02 ) amenable surgical resection . Primary tumor &gt; 4 cm ( stage enter ) make likely excess tumor available resection . Patient must deem surgical candidate . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Appendix C ) . No prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy biologic/targeted therapy current diagnosis lung cancer . Adequate Organ Function Age ≥18 year . Nonpregnant . Females childbearing potential ( surgically sterilize postmenopausal [ woman &gt; 45 year age menses great 1 year ] ) must test negative pregnancy within 48 hour prior initial study procedure base serum pregnancy test . No active invasive malignancy past 2 year nonmelanoma skin cancer . Cancers insitu consider invasive . Signed write informed consent include HIPAA accord institutional guideline . Patients must agree research blood sample participate study . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Postop predict FEV1 DLCO &gt; 40 % predict ( per institutional standard ) . Treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Concurrent administration antitumor therapy . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Inability comply protocol study procedure . Active infection require antibiotic , antifungal antiviral agent , opinion investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency etc ) consider form systemic treatment . Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Disease , exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ eg , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome Myasthenia Gravis ) . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know additional invasive malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has major surgery ( definitive lung cancer surgery ) within two week study serious concomitant disorder opinion investigator would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study . Has receive nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 30 day dose pembrolizumab ) . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however , intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine allow . Has history myocardial infarction occur less 6 month inclusion , know uncontrolled arrhythmia , symptomatic angina pectoris , active ischemia , cardiac failure control medication . Patients CAD recently treat surgery and/or stent , stable without symptomatic angina pectoris , active ischemia eligible . Has history interstitial lung disease Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious ) illness .</criteria>
