	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect 'muscle spar technique ' harvest costal/rib cartilage postoperative donor-site morbidity -namely postoperative pain . Although author report 'muscle spar technique ' cause le pain investigated evidence-based-medicine perspective . Therefore investigator plan control , prospective clinical trial compare conventional method 'muscle spar technique ' . Effect Costal Harvesting Technique Postoperative Donor-site Morbidity : Does Muscle Sparing Technique Cause Less Postoperative Pain ? A Clinical Trial</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Costal Harvesting Technique Postoperative Donor-site Morbidity : Does Muscle Sparing Technique Cause Less Postoperative Pain ? A Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Revision rhinoplasty patient require costal cartilage enrol study . All costal cartilage harvesting full-thickness carry single-surgeon ( Berke Ozucer ) . Patients randomly assign either 'Conservative Muscle-cuttingHarvesting Technique ' 'Muscle-sparing Harvesting Technique ' . Surgical technique costal cartilage harvest group identical expect : M-Cutting group : Following skin incision No.15 blade ; layer include subcutaneous fat , muscle fascia muscle cover cartilage cut Monopolar electrocautery ( 25 watt ) . M-Sparing group : : Following skin incision No.15 blade ; layer include subcutaneous fat , muscle fascia muscle cover cartilage pass blunt dissection . Muscle fiber dissect parallel positioning . Postoperative pain evaluate Visual Analogue Scale . Participants question regard donor-site pain ask score pain 0 ( minimum 10 ( maximum ) . Passive state pain active evaluate separately . This evaluation carry 6th postoperative hour , first , second , third postoperative-days , first postoperative week , 15th ,30th 45th day postoperatively . Also postoperative need analgesic also note first three day . Muscle-cutting muscle-sparing group analyse mean Â± Standard deviation value . These value compare statistically assess whether muscle-sparing technique significant effect reduce postoperative pain .</detailed_description>
