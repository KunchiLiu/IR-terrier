	<brief_summary>Background : Some people Ebola virus body month recover Ebola virus disease . Some may health problem virus others fine . These people may able pas virus others . There currently drug people survive Ebola virus disease still virus body . A new drug , GS-5734 , might help get rid Ebola virus semen . Objective : To test GS-5734 help get rid Ebola virus semen safe human . Eligibility : Men participate Ebola survivor study ( PREVAIL III ) evidence Ebola virus semen Design : Participants screen : Questions Physical exam Eye exam Blood test 2 semen sample test recently Participants must live near study site Liberia 6 month . Participants put 1 2 study group . They infusion either GS-5734 placebo every day 5 day . A plastic tube put arm vein . The infusion last 1 hour . Participants observe 1 hour . They provide semen sample infusion day 4 . After infusion , participant 5 visit first month , 1 per month 5 month . These include give blood semen sample . Blood test perform infusion last visit ( 5 month visit ) also include eye exam . When study , study drug work safe , participant get placebo get study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GS-5734 Assess Antiviral Activity , Longer-Term Clearance Ebola Virus , Safety Male Ebola Survivors With Evidence Ebola Virus Persistence Semen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With unprecedented size recent 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak , scientific community learn great deal psychological physical consequence Ebola , Ebola viral persistence survivor , risk Ebola disease relapse survivor , potential survivor transmit virus others . Data PREVAIL III demonstrate persistence Ebola virus semen male survivor common . In addition Ebola virus persistence , Ebola relapse cause clinical disease well document . There licensed therapy treatment Ebola virus disease clearance persistent Ebola virus survivor . A safe , effective therapy reduce and/or eliminate persistent Ebola virus semen would reduce risk transmission enable male survivor resume normal sexual relation without fear harm love one . The mechanism underlie Post-Ebola Syndrome yet unknown , improvement Post-Ebola sign symptom result GS-5734 treatment would add benefit . This study double-blind , randomize , two-phase ( treatment longer-term follow-up ) , two-arm trial GS-5734 versus placebo among male Ebola survivor persistent Ebola virus RNA semen . Participants randomize 1:1 receive either 100 mg GS-5734 placebo daily intravenous catheter 5 day . Informed transaminase elevation prior Phase I study , riskmitigation strategy include built-in dose de-escalation . This base individual daily monitoring transaminase treatment early DSMB safety review . Participants stratify basis one versus two positive semen sample Ebola virus RNA use Cepheid GeneXpert platform assess within 42 day prior study enrollment . Antiviral activity , well safety tolerability , assess treatment phase . Longer-term clearance Ebola virus assess 5-month follow-up phase . Primary analysis assessment antiviral activity treatment phase focus assay negativity rate ( ANR ; percentage genital sample negative Ebola ) first 28 day study , well clinical laboratory adverse event . A sample consider negative PCR test result undetectable . Primary analysis follow-up phase focus ANR collect monthly month 2 6 .</detailed_description>
