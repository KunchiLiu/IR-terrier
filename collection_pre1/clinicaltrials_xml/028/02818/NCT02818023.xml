	<brief_summary>The study plan treat patient pembrolizumab thus block PD-1/PD-L1 axis would render tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) tumor parenchyma functional consequence BRAF inhibition , T cell activation BRAFi would dampen PD-1/PD-L1 interaction . This combination would reverse dysfunction among T cell tumor parenchyma , maximize T cell mediate immune anti-tumor efficacy . Progression free survival ( PFS ) pembrolizumab KEYNOTE-001 57 % 6 month , 46.4 % recently report phase III trial . PFS vemurafenib treatment BRIM-3 ~50 % 6 month . Combined treatment pembrolizumab vemurafenib BRAF mutant melanoma hypothesize safe improve PFS compare recent historical control . Because combination yet test , primary objective ass safety , investigator stag accrual first phase trial . The study aim accrue 50 patient mTPI design study expectation least 30 patient treated RP2D . In case le 30 patient RP2D , additional patient accrue . Patients continue receive treatment pembrolizumab vemurafenib disease progression toxicity . Patients treatment response dose limit toxicity may receive treatment pembrolizumab 24 month .</brief_summary>
