	<brief_summary>Nasal adenocarcinomas closely related wood dust exposure . The precise mechanism carcinogenesis lead transformation respiratory mucosa colonic-like mucosa remain unknown : chronic exposure wood dust may cause chronic inflammation may lead pre-degenerative lesion , hypothesis yet unconfirmed . The tumor development require activation particular gene : CDX2 . The work hypothesis chronic wood dust exposure responsible change gene inflammation , turn lead change expression CDX2 cofactor , thus make possible genesis adenocarcinoma . This work pilot study aim good understand mechanism carcinogenesis , study feasibility large prospective screening woodworker adenocarcinomas . Cells obtain risk area ( olfactory cleft ) noninvasive method ( brush ) healthy volunteer ( unexposed wood dust ) expose volunteer compare genome study genomic change relate wood dust exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot study , single center , prospective retrospective , aim well understand mechanisms carcinogenesis nasal adenocarcinoma among 2 group subject base potential risk nasal adenocarcinoma . Patients recruit prospectively , ENT department ( Prof. R. JANKOWSKI-Institut Lorrain Heart vessel Louis Mathieu -Hospitals Brabois-CHU Nancy ) , visit another medical reason . They divide 2 group follow : - Group 1 : NON EXPOSED : control group : patient expose wood dust ( low risk ) - Group 2 : EXPOSED : patient expose wood dust ( high risk ) After complete information , inclusion study propose patient If inclusion accept , patient undergo , nasal fiber endoscopy ( perform care ) , local anesthesia ( perform care ) , brush accessible olfactory clef ( perform research ) . These sample compare tumor sample already available ( REFCOR ) The sample group 1 2 send directly laboratory Pathological Anatomy Cytology ( Pr-J.M . VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy ) . They briefly vortexed ( 5 min ) frozen . They keep laboratory Pathological Anatomy Cytology ( Pr-J.M . VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy ) analysis . The sample transfer laboratory Pathological Anatomy Cytology ( Pr-J.M . VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy ) Genomics Platform ( INSERM , U954 , Prof. JL GUEANT- Faculty Medicine , University Lorraine ) , analysis . RNA extract olfactory cell , use RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) DNase treatment . The concentration purity DNA / RNA measure ( OD 230nm , 260nm 280nm ) Nanodrop spectrophotometer ( Nyxor ) . The RNA integrity determine profile ribosomal RNAs ( 18S &amp; 28S ) measure LabOnChip® ( 2100 Bioanalyzer System , Agilent Technologies ) . The RNA sample store -80 ° C use . The transcriptome analysis conduct chip Whole Human Genome 60K * 8 develop Agilent® , accord manufacturer 's protocol ( single-color Agilent protocol ) . At end research sample destroy .</detailed_description>
