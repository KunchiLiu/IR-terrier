This open label study 10 subject , dose gradually increase manufacturer recommend target dose , tolerability evaluate dose level . Based response subject Stage 1 , target dose determine next stage . Standardized tool administer study tolerability efficacy . Efficacy assessment simply explorative , do look effect warrant specific different evaluation next stage . The major purpose Stage 2 ass safety tolerability GWP42003-P determine dose , secondarily study efficacy , particularly regard tremor .

	<brief_title>A Study Tolerability Efficacy Cannabidiol Tremor Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive disable tremor , slowness , stiffness , balance impairment , cognitive deficit , psychiatric symptom , autonomic dysfunction , fatigue insomnia . Tremor may interfere necessary daily work function . The disorder affect approximately seven million people globally . The total economic cost US around 23 billion dollar . In addition economic cost , PD reduce quality life affect caregiver . Cognitive impairment common feature range delay recall early stage global dementia 80 % end stage . PD dementia associate reduce quality life , shorten survival , increase caregiver distress . Depression , anxiety psychosis also common particularly disable PD , even early stage . These symptom important consequence quality life daily function , associate increase carer burden risk nursing home admission . Anxiety affect 40 % patient PD , may predate motor symptom several year . The common anxiety disorder PD panic attack ( often off-periods ) , generalize anxiety disorder , simple social phobia . Psychotic symptom vary frequency accord definition use . If mild form include , affect 50 % patient . Visual hallucination common type . However , hallucination occur sensory domain delusion various type also relatively common . The impact psychosis substantial associate dementia , depression , early mortality , great caregiver strain , nursing home placement . Current therapy inadequate . Medications improve prognosis PD , also problematic adverse effect . Since treatment PD often unsatisfactory since marijuana recently become legal readily available Colorado , person PD try . Patients heard internet , support group source marijuana helpful . Most , without supervision even knowledge neurologist . In survey conduct spring 2014 University Colorado Movement Disorders Center ( UCMDC ) clinic 5 % 207 PD patient , average age 69 , report use marijuana . In clinic , 30 % PD patient ask doctor visit past 6 month marijuana . In another study Katerina Venderova colleague report 25 % PD patient take cannabis General University Hospital Prague . PD mostly affect elderly , cognitive , psychiatric motor problem , subject prone fall . Cannabis well document cause psychosis , slowness , incoordination . Studies also show chronic user structural functional CNS alteration . Thus cannabis expect risky person PD . Further , many component cannabis , cannabis preparation sell Colorado vary widely composition . There definitive data regard benefit risk various preparation PD . Studies safety efficacy greatly need protect fragile Colorado population . Cannabidiol ( CBD ) cannabinoid present less extent street marijuana , limit delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) 's psychoactive effect . CBD act experimental model anti-inflammatory , anticonvulsant , anti-oxidant , anti-emetic , anxiolytic antipsychotic agent , therefore potential beneficial medical us . Further , animal study suggest CBD neuroprotective , perhaps due report anti-oxidative anti-inflammatory action . Human trial report CBD decrease anxiety cause sedation healthy individual , decrease psychotic symptom schizophrenia PD , improve motor non-motor symptom alleviate levodopa-induced dyskinesia PD . The ratio THC CBD play role preparation 's therapeutic outcome : strain cannabis high concentration CBD produce short-term memory impairment vs. strain high concentration THC low concentration CBD . Many clinician suspect cannabis may positive effective upon particular patient group idea cannabinoid profile use . Without know composition , impossible draw conclusion simply huge variety strain utilised . Given current literature regard CBD : possible neuroprotective effect , good tolerability , anxiolytic antipsychotic effect general lack well tolerated PD , include effect tremor , investigator hypothesize CBD would well tolerate would reduce tremor , anxiety psychosis , would stabilize cognitive decline PD . First investigator perform open label study determine reasonable dose , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study evaluate efficacy tolerability oral CBD tremor important aspect PD . A strength study use well defined form CBD . Stage 1 : Open Label Dose Escalation Tolerability Study Primary Specific Aim : To confirm dosage regimen CBD , form GWP42003-P recommended study drug manufacturer safe tolerate 10 subject PD . GWP42003-P start 5 mg/kg/day increase 5 mg/kg 3 day interval target dose 25 mg/kg/day . Secondary Specific Aim : To examine effect CBD severity &amp; duration tremor condition problematic PD . Stage 2 : Randomized , Controlled Trial Primary Specific Aim : To evaluate safety tolerability CBD , form GWP42003-P , PD . Secondary Specific Aim : To examine effect CBD severity &amp; duration intractable tremor PD . Exploratory Aims : 1 . To study effect CBD cognition , anxiety , psychosis , sleep , daytime sleepiness , mood , fatigue , pain , impulsivity , motor non-motor PD sign , restless legs syndrome REM sleep behavior disorder . 2 . To evaluate effect CBD condition low dose . The dose escalation tolerability study conduct 10 subject ( investigator recruit 15 subject end 10 ) open label study last approximately 3 week follow 2-week safety follow . Subjects closely monitor dose titrate . Subjects screen visit , baseline visit within next three week , visit subject 20 mg/kg/day , final assessment visit subject maximal tolerate target dose 10-15 day , safety visit 2 week later . The subject maximal tolerate target dose 10-15 day . Subjects call 3rd day dose . During phone call subject monitor adverse event , especially excessive daytime sleepiness , symptoms hepatotoxicity , well change medical history concomitant medication . Subjects also call 3 day stop study drug check sign withdrawal . The main study randomize , placebo control , double-blind crossover design two treatment phase , approximately 7 week duration separate 3-week washout phase . In 7 week treatment phase subject start study drug titrate maximum tolerate target dose ( 25 mg/kg/day ) . Each subject screen visit , baseline visit within 3 week , low dose visit ( 5 mg/kg/day 10-15 day ) , visit 20 mg/kg/day , first end 7 week treatment phase visit ( subject reach maximum tolerate targeted dose ) , start second 7-week treatment phase visit , low dose visit ( 5 mg/kg/day 10-15 day ) , visit 20 mg/kg/day , second end 7 week treatment phase visit safety visit ( 10 visit total ) . At start second 7-week treatment phase , subject dispense instructed take study drug next treatment phase . Subjects call every 3rd day dose escalation every 10th day dose maintenance period ( 25 mg/kg/day ) . During phone call subject monitor adverse event , symptom hepatotoxicity , change medical history concomitant medication . Subjects also call 3 day stop study drug check sign withdrawal . Further , case CBD alters reliability self - report , repeat measure take set test three time : baseline , low dose high dose . During 10 day subject low dose measurement take 3rd 9th day phone visit 10th 15th day . During 28 day high dose measurement take 12th 22nd day phone visit 28th +/- 4 day . The phone assessment include primary outcome ( assessment tolerability ) , SCOPA-sleep , Anxiety short form , Depression short form , Emotional behavioral dyscontrol short form , EQ-5D-5L .</detailed_description>
