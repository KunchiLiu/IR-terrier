	<detailed_description>Cardio -- metabolic ( CM ) risk cluster risk factor indicative patient 's overall risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide type-2 diabetes . CM risk factor include obesity , physical inactivity , smoke , alcohol abuse , abnormal lipid metabolism , hyper-glycaemia arterial hypertension . Educational program lifestyle intervention represent effective tool improve risk profile need time consume expensive counsel supervision various health professional . A rational alternative intensive individual coaching use system self-learning self-monitoring , help people change maintain healthy lifestyle tailor suggestion nutrition , weight control , physical activity , fatigue , stress . SEMEOTICONS exploit human face indicator individual 's health status translate sign obtain face measure descriptor automatically evaluate computerized application , interactive smart mirror , seamlessly integrate contactless sensor , 3D optical sensor , multispectral camera , gas detection sensor , microphone touch-screen interface user 's interaction output visualization . This `` Wize Mirror '' collect data form video , image gas concentration signal , extract number biometric , morphometric , colorimetric , compositional descriptor represent individual 's facial sign . The integration descriptor constitute virtual model use compute trace evolution individual 's wellness index . A health diary index enable individual evaluate personally relate his/her lifestyle his/her well-being . Coaching message provide , relation evolution wellness index descriptor provide useful suggestion correct lifestyle self-monitoring . The purpose study assess accuracy information derive Wize Mirror express health status individual . Arm 1 Reproducibility repeatability study ( perform French site Lyon ) . The reproducibility repeatability study evaluate whether Wize Mirror measurement influence meal , light temperature condition 6 healthy volunteer Data acquire 4 module correspond different use condition mirror 1 . - Changes fast state Under artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) , Wize Mirror measurement acquire baseline fast state 30 , 60 120 minute standardize breakfast three consecutive day . 2 . - Changes light condition Wize Mirror measurement perform baseline artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) 30 ' artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) 3 time consecutively morning 20 minute interval acquisition . 3 . - Changes temperature condition Wize Mirror measurement perform baseline artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) 30 ' artificial light temperature increase 28- 30°C , 3 time consecutively morning 20 minute interval acquisition . 4 . - Simultaneous change light temperature condition Wize Mirror measurement perform baseline artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) 30 ' natural light temperature increase 28- 30°C , 6 volunteer 3 time consecutively morning 20 minute interval acquisition . The visit last approximately 3 hour . A breakfast offered end visit . To assess whether measurement stable short time span one 6 volunteer undergo last visit repeatability study fast state . Wize Mirror measurement perform T0 artificial light environment temperature ( 18-20°C ) 10 consecutive time 30 minute interval acquisition . During visit follow Wize Mirror measurement perform : - face morphometry 3D reconstruction face image - colorimetric analysis - heart rate respiratory rate - autofluorescence detection protein glycation - skin cholesterol content - thermal-induced vasodilation application warm air 42°C temperature cheek study microvascular function - face expression stress fatigue 3D reconstruction face image - exhale gas analysis ethanol carbon dioxide Arm 2 Validation study . The validation study check data measure Wize Mirror reference clinical test 60 healthy volunteer . To verify whether Wize Mirror able detect variation physical emotional health status appropriate lifestyle change , measurement cross-checked enrolment 3 month personalize suggestion healthy behavior . Healthy volunteer undergo recruitment follow user profile baseline CM risk 1 . Medical history , 2 . Physical examination : anthropometric measurement ( body height , body weight , waist circumference , hip circumference ) vital sign ( heart/respiratory rate , blood pressure ) 3 . Body composition ( lean mass , fatty mass ) air displacement pletysmography 4 . Energy expenditure indirect calorimetry 5 . Peripheral venous blood sampling : hemoglobin , creatinine , Total , HDL , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , gamma glutamyl transferase , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin , glucose , insulin , HbA1c 6 . Skin accumulation Advanced Glycation End Products ( AGEs ) 7 . Peripheral arterial tonometry endothelium-dependent vasodilatation 8 . Pulse oxymetry oxygen saturation 9 . Exhaled gas sample 10 . Psychological , knowledge nutritional test 1. measure psychological well : Life Orientation Test-Revised ( LOT-R ) ; General self efficacy scale ( GSES ) 2. measure anxiety , depression : Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) ; Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) 3. measure quality life : Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) ; Short Form ( SF ) -12 Health Survey ; Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) ; World Health Organization ( WHO ) ( Five ) Well Being Index 4. measure eat smoke behaviour physical activity : WHO STEPwise approach noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance ( STEPS ) ; Audit C Alcohol ; Fagenstrom 's test ; International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) physical activity ; Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) dietary regimen 5. measure motivation change : Motivation change physical activity , physical activity ( MAC2-AF R ) ; motivation change , nutrition ( MAC2- AL R ) 6. measure health literacy : Newest Vital Sign ( NVS ) Cardio-metabolic risk score calculate estimate CM risk profile 1 . Heart-SCORE 2 . Fatty-liver-Index ( FLI ) 3 . Finnish Type 2 Diabetes Risk Score ( FINDRISC ) 4 . Homeostasis Model Assessment ( HOMA ) index Data acquisition derive computational descriptor Wize Mirror function include image ( still picture , video ) acquisition visible light infrared band thermal stimulation 42° C Exhaled gas sample use `` Wize Sniffer '' . During visit follow Wize Mirror measurement perform : - face morphometry 3D reconstruction face image - colorimetric analysis - heart rate respiratory rate - autofluorescence detection protein glycation - skin cholesterol content - thermal-induced vasodilation application warm air 42°C temperature cheek study microvascular function - face expression stress fatigue 3D reconstruction face image - exhale gas analysis ethanol carbon dioxide Healthy volunteer undergo periodically ( minimum time interval 2 week ) face image acquisition , exhale gas sampling fill Wize Mirror screen lifestyle questionnaire till week 12 ( end study ) . At end study visit repeat baseline assessment fill questionnaire evaluate Wize Mirror ease use acceptability . The change Wize Mirror measurement obtain baseline end study correlate change body weight , waist circumference Fatty liver index . Relationship quality life , well-being questionnaire SCORE , standard biochemistry specific test also assess .</detailed_description>
