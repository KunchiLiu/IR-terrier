	<brief_summary>The purpose study prospectively evaluate major minor neurologic event patient undergo right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery compare different aortic clamping technique ; specifically , endoaortic balloon retrograde perfusion ( Endoreturn ) transthoracic clamp retrograde perfusion . Major neurologic event evaluate standard neurologic evaluation ; minor neurologic event evaluate magnetic resonance ( MR ) assessment . The first aim study determine number impact microembolic event right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery clinical neurological status MR evaluation . The investigator also aim determine different technique aortic clamping may impact early outcome . Study hypothesis : despite recent concern arise endoaortic balloon retrograde perfusion , investigator expect show equivalence term safety effectiveness technique compare transthoracic clamp select population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence neurologic event right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery compare conventional surgery controversial issue extensively study . In meta-analysis publish Modi et al , equal occurrence neurologic event patient underwent MIMVS underwent median sternotomy find . Conversely , Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac database Cleveland Clinic group conclude risk stroke significantly high less invasive group . Moreover , recent data suggest retrograde arterial perfusion , particularly patient severe arch/ascending aortic atherosclerosis , could source significant increase incidence cerebral complication . The meta-analysis Cheng , document 1.79 fold increase risk stroke right thoracotomy group , subgroup analysis appear driven high stroke risk study report endoaortic balloon occlusion transthoracic clamp . Murzi et al . report 4.28 fold increase stroke risk RAP 1280 primary MIMVS patient . Grossi colleague show significant risk factor neurologic event use retrograde perfusion high-risk patient aortic disease . The purpose randomized blind study prospectively evaluate major minor neurologic event patient undergo right thoracotomy mitral valve surgery retrograde perfusion endoaortic balloon clamp ( Endoreturn ) transthoracic clamp . Major neurologic event evaluate standard neurologic evaluation ; minor neurologic event evaluate magnetic resonance assessment . MR evaluation perform blinded radiologist . MR perform 3T system ( Philips INGENIA 3T ) . The protocol include conventional sequence morphological quantitative assessment ( 3D-FLAIR , 3D-T1-TSE , DWI , T2-FFE ) non conventional sequence white matter microstructural evaluation ( Diffusion Tensor Imaging - DTI fractional anisotropy mean diffusivity ) . No contrast enhance use . Patients contraindication undergo cerebral MR surgery baseline assessment . Then , randomize one 2 group . If contraindication arise postoperative period ( eg definitive pacemaker implantation ) , patient undergo cerebral MR discharge , highlight presence new ischemic lesion , even clinically silent . After 6 month , patient develop new ischemic lesion reveal post-operative cerebral MR repeat new MR ass evolution cerebral damage Neurologic assessment perform blinded specialist Neurology Department . Type study : Single center randomize blind study perform University Turin , Citt√† della Salute e della Scienza Hospital include : Cardiac Surgery department . Neuroradiology department . Aims study : To determine incidence new lesion pre-discharge MR patient undergo right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery accord different aortic clamping technique . To assess correlation clinical neurological peri-procedural event ( TIA , Stroke ) , occurrence new lesion pre-discharge MR. To assess evolution new cerebral ischemic lesion pre-discharge MR follow-up MR ( 6 month later ) . To investigator knowledge first randomize blind study compare two right mini-thoracotomy technique mitral valve surgery select population ( without risk factor neurological event ) MR . The result study able allow surgeon choose best less dangerous method case mini-invasive operation . This could rapresent fundamental step confirm efficacy safety mini-invasive approach mitral valve surgery resulting , addition , reduction cost procedure .</detailed_description>
