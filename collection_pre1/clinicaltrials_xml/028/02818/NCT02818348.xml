	<brief_summary>This study aim provide information safety pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction darunavir/cobicistat ( 800/150mg QD ) etravirine ( 400mg QD ) HIV-infected patient , well evaluate efficacy concomitant administration darunavir/cobicistat etravirine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Drug-drug Interactions Between Darunavir/Cobicistat Etravirine Hiv- Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Toxicity associate use nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) treatment VIH-infection prompt increase interest new antiretroviral treatment strategy without NRTIs ( nuc-sparing regimen ) . Ritonavir boost protease inhibitor ( PI/r ) like , lopinavir , atazanavir , saquinavir darunavir may candidate maintenance mono-therapy due high potency genetic barrier drug resistance possibility daily dose . However , although several control uncontrolled study conduct examine safety tolerance PI/r monotherapy maintenance HIV-infected patient , many study small use control ; evidence efficacy safety PI/r monotherapy therefore limit . Moreover , several trial report high rate intermittent viremia patient PI/r monotherapy . A metaanalysis include 10 randomise control clinical trial report absolute increase risk virological failure one year PI/r monotherapy roughly 10 % 13 % . Therefore , PI/r monotherapy option clinician patient want accept risk . If nuc-sparing regimen use , dual regimen may alternative PI/r monotherapy . This approach could able prevent NRTI-derived toxicity maintain antiviral efficacy . Consequently , grow interest strategy emerge recent year . Ideally , dual antiretroviral regimen efficacious safe , permit once-daily administration low pill burden , high genetic barrier towards development drug resistance mutation patient might eventually develop virological failure . The combination boost PI darunavir plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor etravirine fulfill requirement , may attractive dual antiretroviral treatment regimen . Although clinical experience combination still limit , promise result previous study support current interest use dual therapy clinical practice . Moreover , fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) tablet contain darunavir new pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat ( Rezolsta® ) recently launch market . Among potential advantage , FDC may contribute decrease pill burden well avoid medication error . However , accord prescribe information , darunavir/cobicistat etravirine combine due potential drug-drug interaction . Darunavir cobicistat metabolize isoenzyme CYP3A4 cytochrome P450 , inhibit cobicistat . On hand , etravirine , mainly metabolize 2C19 ( also CYP3A4 minor extent ) , CYP3A4 inducer . Based rationale , etravirine could decrease exposure cobicistat , eventually leading concentration cobicistat might insufficient boost darunavir . Although clinically relevant change drug concentration evidence specific trial evaluate presence drug-drug interaction darunavir/ritonavir etravirine , combination darunavir/cobicistat etravirine might sensitive CYP3A induce effect etravirine . However , specific data potential drug-drug interaction still lack . Consequently , combination darunavir/cobicistat etravirine currently recommend per prescribe formal pharmacokinetic data support combination generate .</detailed_description>
