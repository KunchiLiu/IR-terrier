	<brief_title>Impact Apixaban Clinical Outcome Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Stenosis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Four novel oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) release market ahead county world . However , information available clinical result NOACS secondary preventive effect Japanese population . Medical care acute-phase stroke constantly advance . Specifically , addition thrombolytic activator tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) , advancement endovascular thrombectomy make possible treat patient would save otherwise . In Japan , cerebrovascular accident third lead cause death , drop forth thanks wide use various treatment . Nevertheless , patient often suffer severe sequela stroke , even survive . In word , major challenge treatment stroke save patient also improve long-term prognosis . In large-scale study , NOAC show equal great efficacy prevent recurrence stroke compare warfarin significantly reduce incidence bleeding complication . Furthermore , Aristotle trial compare apixaban vs. warfarin demonstrate apixaban provide significant prevention stroke recurrence well significant reduction bleed complication death . Heparin warfarin use mainstream agent prevention recurrence hyperacute phase treatment.However , Aristotle trial show significant difference thromboembolic event apixaban treatment ( 1.27 % /year ) warfarin ( 1.60 % /year ) ( RR 0.79 , p &lt; 0.01 ) . Also , major bleed event less frequent patient apixaban treatment ( 2.13 % /year ) compare warfarin ( 3.09 % /year ) ( RR 0.69 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . This study conduct basis expectation use apixaban place traditional warfarin therapy improve prognosis reduce bleed complication Japanese patient acute occlusion major cerebral artery . Additionally , study analyze correlation use apixaban prognosis incidence bleeding/ischemic event patient intracranial artery stenosis great 50 % atrial fibrillation</detailed_description>
