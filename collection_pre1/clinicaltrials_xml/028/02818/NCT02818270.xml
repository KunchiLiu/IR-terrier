	<brief_title>Evaluation Aerosolized Drugs Deposition During Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerosolized medication use widely patient respiratory illness admit intensive care unit , include bronchodilator , steroid , mucolytics , antibiotic . Aerosol delivery ventilator influence numerous factor ventilator-related , circuit-related device-related factor . Aerosolized drug delivery ventilator system study bench model albuterol , yet result often overestimate . Only clinical trial aerosol delivery deposition publish last decade . In addition , inhaled bronchodilator , mucolytics , antibiotic , steroid often administer ventilated patient intensive care unit Taiwan , never study . Therefore , aim study evaluate inhale bronchodilator mucolytics ( acetylcystine ) deliver jet nebulizer ventilator system intubated patient .</detailed_description>
