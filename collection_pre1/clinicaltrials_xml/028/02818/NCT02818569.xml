	<detailed_description>Sleep basic human function occupies approximately one-third life . Much know benefit sleep human obtain study patient insomnia , common sleep disorder report prevalence 10 15 % . Unfortunately , insomnia independent risk factor acute myocardial infarction , coronary heart disease , heart failure , hypertension , diabetes , death . More , sleep disturbance lead neurocognitive deficit delirium psychosis . However , principal medication ( i.e . benzodiazepine , zolpidem ) currently use treat insomnia associate side effect daytime sedation , delirium , anterograde memory disturbance , complex sleep-related behavior . We recently find nighttime intravenous bolus administration dexmedetomidine associate normal sleep architecture comprise rapid eye movement ( REM ) non-REM ( N1 , N2 , N3 ) sleep , improve next-day psychomotor vigilance performance compare zolpidem . Presently , dexmedetomidine available intravenous formulation . The goal project develop dexmedetomidine , alpha-2 receptor agonist , oral sublingual sleep therapeutic neurocognitive sparing profile . Sleep crucial maintain normal health well-being . Insomnia , disorder sleep onset maintenance , prevalent approximately 10-15 % population . Insomnia largely treat medication similar anesthetic , target gamma-amino-butyric acid A ( GABAA ) receptor throughout brain globally inhibit activity cause sedation . Sedation GABA receptor modulate anesthetic insomnia medication associate beta ( 13-25 Hz ) oscillation relatively fast oscillatory dynamic associate natural sleep . Rather , oscillatory dynamic , result interneuron antisynchrony , associate amnesic drug effect . Our objective investigation evaluate efficacy biomimetic sleep reduce incidence severity delirium extubated CSICU patient .</detailed_description>
