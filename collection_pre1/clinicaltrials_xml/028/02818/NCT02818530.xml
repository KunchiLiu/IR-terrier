	<detailed_description>Intra ocular pressure ( IOP ) may theoretically increase due steep Trendelenberg position study show IOP reach peak level steep Trendelenberg position average 13 mmHg high preanesthesia induction value . Major determinant IOP aqueous humor flow , choroidal blood volume , central venous pressure extra ocular muscle tone . During robotic surgery two theory explain increase IOP , first , gravitational force increase central venous pressure turn affect orbital venous pressure increase IOP . Second , intraperitoneal carbon dioxide cause increase choroidal blood volume may result IOP increase . One study report low end tidal carbon dioxide significant predictor IOP increase . Continuous absorption carbon dioxide peritoneum increase pressure diaphragm result low deliver tidal volume subsequently increase arterial carbon dioxide level lead increase choroidal blood flow increase IOP . Hassen GW et al measure anterior chamber depth 2 patient glaucoma compare anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) intraocular pressure measure tonometer . They conclude bedside ultrasound could useful evaluate patient suspect increased IOP , unable open eye . It also use serial examination follow-up treatment success . They also mention , necessary conduct prospective study large sample size , evaluate agreement measurement use tonometer measurement ACD use ultrasound . In addition , essential determine cut normal ACD evaluation IOP .</detailed_description>
