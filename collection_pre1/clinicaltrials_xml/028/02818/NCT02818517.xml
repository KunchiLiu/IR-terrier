	<detailed_description>The survival rate cancer patient greatly increase past decade ' mainly due early detection use new medication high dos combine protocol . This achievement come price cardio toxicity , lead cardiac dysfunction range transient asymptomatic leave ventricular dysfunction cardiac death . In long term , risk death cardiovascular cause exceed tumor recurrence many type cancer . As result increase number long-term cancer survivor magnitude problem growing . Early identification cardio toxicity identify clinical follow-up use electrocardiography , cardiac biomarkers ( Troponin , brain natriuretic peptide ) echocardiogram . Past study imply addition angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor ( ACE inhibitor ) beta blocker patient 's treatment may prevent development cardiac dysfunction . However , currently specific clear guideline follow-up management cardio-toxicity cancer patient . The aim study : To try identify patient increase risk develop cardio toxicity , follow clinical evaluation , cardiac biomarkers echocardiogram examination , purpose early diagnosis , management prevention cardiac event . For achieve investigator build registry include oncologic patient go evaluation cardio-oncology clinic Tel Aviv Medical Center . The study compose two group : 1 . The retrospective group analysis include oncologic patient evaluate cardio-oncology clinic 01 January 2014 31 May 2016 . 2 . The prospective group include oncologic patient evaluate cardio-oncology clinic 01 June 2016 onward . The patient sign inform consent form . The data collect include demographic : gender , age , duration hospitalization , diagnosis , symptom , clinical well laboratory , echocardiographic echicardiogram finding . The study base unidentified data take medical record medical file patient . Identified detail separate way wo n't enable review . All data handle separation identify data do Principal Investigator , sub-investigator study , charge hear screen program Tel Aviv Medical Center . The study population include patient evaluate cardio-oncology clinic hospital diagnosis cancer plan chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment . The data collect include gender , age , cardiovascular risk factor , cardiovascular disease , type cancer , type chemotherapy and/or radiation plan , past chemotherapy and/or radiation , vital sign , basic ECG , blood test pre post therapy ( include troponin , CPK , BNP , glucose HBA1C , cholesterol , triglyceride , CRP , WBC , neutrophil count , lymphocyte count , RDW , BNP ) , Echo baseline post therapy ( Systolic diastolic function , strain valvular function ) , ACE inhibitor beta blocker treatment , complication mortality .</detailed_description>
