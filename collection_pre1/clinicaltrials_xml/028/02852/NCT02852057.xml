	<brief_summary>This study focus glaucoma therapy drug elute contact lens . The contact lens load timolol maleate dorzolamide hydrochloride , commonly use ophthalmic drug . Additionally , lenses contain vitamin E ( ( + ) α-tocopherol ) additive achieve extended release drug . This study assess safety drug load contact lenses effectiveness . Effectiveness drop IOP use lens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glaucoma second large cause blindness world ( large amongst African-Americans ) affect 66.8 million people , leave 6.7 million bilateral blindness . The World Health Organization estimate 2020 number case blindness due glaucoma double 12 million . The financial impact glaucoma US economy $ 1.5 billion annually . Glaucoma manage several intra ocular pressure ( IOP ) lower medication include Pfizer 's XALATAN® ( latanoprost ) , account 27 % total US market Jan 2010 . Effective management however require patient-compliance , frequently low eye drop base therapy . The compliance le 50 % glaucoma eye drop , even low multiple drop and/or multiple drug therapy . In recent study 204 glaucoma patient , 71 % able instill drop eye , 39 % without touch bottle eye surface . The lack patient-compliance glaucoma therapy arise several source . Firstly , due chronic nature disease , patient glaucoma medication immediately discern benefit take medication regularly , sufficiently motivate compliant . Even patient regularly take medicine eye drop , compliance far perfect due difficulty instill eye drop . In addition lack compliance , low bioavailability glaucoma drug deliver eye drop major problem , lead side effect range irritation unpleasant taste debilitate effect heart problem . The corneal bioavailability glaucoma drug range 1-5 % rapid tear turn accompany drug transport conjunctiva , large area permeability compare cornea . The conjunctival nasal absorption lead systemic exposure tissue , thus lead potential side effect . The presence preservatives benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) contribute toxicity eye drop . The deficiency eye drop formulation glaucoma therapy address Ocusert® ( Alza ) , highly successful pilocarpine release ocular insert place cul de sac eye . Ocusert® show clinical study produce constant reduction IOP 7 day 23 . The total dosage pilocarpine administer one Ocusert® system 7-days one-eighth amount provide 28 application ( 4 day ) 2 % eyedrop . The simplified regimen reduce side effect Ocusert® encourage patient compliance . Unfortunately , manufacturer Ocusert® discontinue make likely due drawback device include retention problem , twist change shape , sight impediment due dislocation device front pupil , important sudden burst release 0.4 % case could cause toxicity . Additionally , pilocarpine replace several new drug prostaglandin first line defense glaucoma . Our goal propose research replicate success Ocusert® new drug different device design eliminate drawback Ocusert® . To improve compliance reduce side effect , propose develop drug delivery system excellent retention biocompatibility , continuous release drug extend duration , high bioavailability possibility drug leakage . Contact lenses high possible bioavailability cornea drug release contact lenses trap thin post lens tear film cornea lens extended period longer 30 minute , compare 2-5 minute eye drop . The increased residence time lead high fractional drug uptake cornea , reduces need dose , thereby improve safety profile . The use contact lenses treat glaucoma also result high compliance patient also need vision correction always insert lens vision correction , even immediately appreciate benefit IOP reduction . Additional benefit contact lens base drug delivery elimination preservatives multi-use eye drop formulation , cause discomfort redness . Finally , contact lenses commonly use medical device 41 million wearer United States five decade history safe use . Based consideration , drug load contact lens could promise delivery ophthalmic drug .</detailed_description>
