	<brief_title>Physical/Self-perceived Performance 3D Shoulder Kinematics Volleyball Attackers With/Without Shoulder Complaints Scapular Dyskinesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volleyball attacker clinically identify scapular dyskinesis with/without shoulder symptom compare respect performance outcome scapular kinematics . Performance assess mean unilateral seat shot put test ( USSPT ) , upper quarter Y balance test ( UQYBT ) , Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand , sport module ( DASH ) . Pain measurement complete physical performance measure assess rat . Relationships physical ( USSPT , UQYBT ) self-perceived ( DASH ) measure performance , impairment-based measure ( clinical measure 3D shoulder kinematics ) assess .</detailed_description>
