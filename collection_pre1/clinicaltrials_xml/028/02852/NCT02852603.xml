	<brief_title>Study Genetically Affected Sporadic Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracic aortic dissection ( TAD ) critical clinical condition partly due rupture aortic aneurysm . Mostly , surgical treatment reduce symptom extend life span patient thoracic aortic aneurysm dissection ( TAAD ) . However , mortality TAAD remain high huge blood lose aorta . Sporadic TAAD consider server consequence hypertension , though patient hypertension wo n't TAAD final outcome . Previous study reveal association genetic abnormality familial TAAD , genetic test apply assist diagnosis certain TAAD . Therefore , potentially genetic effect sporadic TAAD explore researcher understand possible mechanism lead sporadic TAAD establish new clinical approach prevent TAAD-caused adverse clinical outcome . This study intend collect gene information sporadic TAAD patient explore relationship genetic variation incidence sporadic TAAD study .</detailed_description>
