	<criteria>Have histologically confirm World Health Organization Grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma gliosarcoma ) . Participants eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma variant make . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . Have Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 ( Appendix A ) . Previous first line therapy least radiotherapy . Be first second relapse . Note : Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e. , radiation ± chemotherapy ) . For participant prior therapy lowgrade glioma , surgical diagnosis highgrade glioma consider first relapse . Participants must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 14 day registration . Table 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ institutional ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 institutional ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN OR ≤ 5 X institutional ULN subject Gilberts syndrome Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X institutional ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ≤1.5 X institutional ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . CT MRI within 14 day prior registration . An interval least 4 week ( registration ) prior surgical resection one week stereotactic biopsy . An interval least 12 week completion radiation therapy registration unless unequivocal histologic confirmation tumor progression . Participants must recover grade 0 1 pretreatment baseline clinically significant toxic effect prior therapy ( include limited exception alopecia , laboratory value list per inclusion criterion , lymphopenia common therapy temozolomide ) . From registration , follow time period must elapse : 5 halflives investigational agent , 4 week cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day temozolomide 6 week nitrosoureas ) , 6 week antibody , 4 week ( 5 halflives , whichever short ) antitumor therapy ( include vaccine ) . No washout period require TTF . Participants must sufficient tissue prior surgery reveal glioblastoma variant submission follow registration . The following amount tissue require : 1 formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue block ( prefer ) OR 10 FFPE unstained slide ( 5 μm thick ) Patients must undergo surgery clinically indicate determine care provider . Patients must eligible surgical resection expectation surgeon able resect least 400mg tumor low risk induce neurological injury . Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior registration . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must agree use highly effective contraception study treatment 120 day study discontinuation . Highly effective contraception define either : True Abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Sterilization : Surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment ( described item 3.1.16 ) . Male Partner Sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . For female subject study , vasectomise male partner must sole partner participant . Use combination two following : Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Appropriate hormonal contraceptive ( include register marketed contraceptive agent contains estrogen and/or progestational agent include oral , subcutaneous , intrauterine , intramuscular agent ) Male subject must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose therapy . Current plan participation study investigational agent use investigational device . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency . Has tumor primarily localize brainstem spinal cord . Has presence diffuse leptomeningeal disease extracranial disease . Has receive systemic immunosuppressive treatment , aside systemic corticosteroid ( methotrexate , chloroquine , azathioprine , etc ) within six month registration . Has receive antiangiogenic antiVEGF target agent ( e.g . bevacizumab , cediranib , aflibercept , vandetanib , XL184 , sunitinib , etc ) . Requires treatment high dose systemic corticosteroid define dexamethasone &gt; 4 mg/day bioequivalent least 3 consecutive day within 2 week registration . Has receive prior interstitial brachytherapy , implanted chemotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery therapeutic deliver local injection convection enhance delivery . Has history know coagulopathy increase risk bleed history clinically significant hemorrhage within 12 month registration . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . Has gastrointestinal bleeding hemorrhage/bleeding event CTCAE Grade &gt; 3 within 6 month registration . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment within 3 year registration . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Examples include limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) .
