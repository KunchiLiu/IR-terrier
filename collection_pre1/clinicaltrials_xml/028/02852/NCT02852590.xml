This mainly due lack clinical trial vulnerable population , practical difficulty ethical consideration arise involve child clinical research . Drugs use within specification product license might less likely cause ADR compare drug either unlicensed off-label use child . Few study show significant association pediatric off-label drug use ADR . To compare probability ADR license drug prescription versus probability ADR prescribe drug off-label child , conduct multi-center prospective observational study different pediatric hospital ward France . The availability electronic health record make study feasible . An automatic data extraction hospital information system implement . A computer algorithm determine pediatric drug labelling ( i.e . off-label unlicensed use ) use French summary product characteristic available Thériaque® database develop . Detection ADRs carry health care professional research group use trigger tool patient ' electronic health record . The causality ADRs suspect medication evaluate use Naranjo French method regional pharmacovigilance center . An independent pharmacovigilance board validate ADR evaluation , assess severity avoidability , indicate therapeutic alternative suspect medication . This , knowledge , first large multi-center prospective study France evaluate relationship adverse drug reaction unlicensed/ off-label drug use hospitalized child . The result study provide information prescription practice amplitude , nature consequence unlicensed/off-label drug use hospitalize child . It also help identify risk factor ADR could use implement preventive action , guide future research field . An indirect benefit represent increase physician ' awareness detect declare ADRs communicate result health professional public . This study fund ANSM ( French Medicine Agency ) .</brief_summary>
