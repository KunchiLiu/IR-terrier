	<detailed_description>Hemiparesis follow stroke frequently lead `` learn non-use '' weak arm hand . Task orient training suggested contemporary neurorehabilitation technique . A single-subject AB series design follow-up conducted ass effectiveness task orient train program administer participant ' home . This intervention , Task Oriented Training Home ( TOTE Home ) , incorporate current experience-dependent plasticity aspect model Acquired Skill Acquisition Program ( ASAP ) protocol parameter principle task orient training suggest Lang Birkenmeier 2014 . Repeated measure accelerometry level confidence priority task analyze visual analysis change level , trend , slope . Change score standardized assessment upper extremity , Motor Activity Log , Stroke Impact Scale question recovery , Functional Test Hemiparetic Upper Extremity , Canadian Occupational Performance Measure evaluate data collect baseline , post-intervention , follow-up time period .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>upper extremity hemiparesis due stroke meet minimal movement criterion affect arm hand ( least 10 degree active movement wrist , elbow , shoulder movement , along 10 degree active movement thumb two finger ) minimal cognitive deficit demonstrate 24 high MiniMental Status Exam able identify least five specific task participant wish achieve affect upper extremity . This assessed Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) least 21 year age able communicate English 312 month stroke would classify subacute level recovery formal occupational therapy complete . upper extremity pain interfered activity daily live require maximal assistance mobility arm hand injury ( unrelated stroke ) upper extremity amputation inability participate due illness , social geographical reason , diagnosis limiting condition would affect participation</criteria>
