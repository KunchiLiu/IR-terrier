	<brief_title>Ethacrynic Acid Elimination Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients Undergoing Transurethral Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer continue significant healthcare financial liability United States . Patients Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer ( NMIBC ) desperate need effective easily tolerate treatment option . Current standard care include immediate post-operative Mitomycin C ( MMC ) , decrease rate recurrence alter progression . Furthermore , patient high-grade NMIBC , standard care dictate patient undergo intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) therapy . This treatment high degree morbidity local systemic side effect along significant discomfort treatment ( intra-urethral catheterization bladder instillation ) . Our goal develop bladder cancer treatment strategy design decrease recurrence/progression rate addition decrease morbidity treatment . Twelve evaluable NMIBC patient participate Phase 1 trial . Treatment - patient receive single , 50 mg oral dose ethacrynic acid administer two 25 mg strength EDECRIN® tablets immediately prior transurethral resection bladder tumor . Concentrations excretion rate ethacrynic acid urine , well cysteine , glutathione , mercapturate metabolite , measure 4 urine specimen collect day surgery ( , , 2 timepoints surgery ) . Adverse event , serious adverse event , laboratory value , vital sign measurement collect . Efficacy ethacrynic acid treatment estimate record recurrence/non-recurrence disease 3 month post-treatment</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : NOTE : Both patient receive standard care concomitant mitomycin C eligible enroll study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Diagnosis presume nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer base office base cystoscopy ( primary recurrent ) , plan transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) Participants must tumor anticipate transurethral resection time ≤ 1 hour Previous history intravesical therapy allow Age ≥ 18 year Performance Status 01 Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcl total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Women childbearing potential ( WOCP ) men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately *A woman childbearing potential female ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . Current anticipated use investigational agent . Patient know nodal distant metastatic disease . Patients nodal metastatic disease require systemic chemotherapy . Furthermore , exclude clinical trial poor overall prognosis . Patients locally advanced bladder cancer base crosssectional imaging ( suspicion extravesical disease hydronephrosis ) Patients tumor anticipate transurethral resection time great 1 hour History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Ethacrynic acid agent use study . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant nursing . There potential congenital abnormality regimen harm nursing infant .</criteria>
