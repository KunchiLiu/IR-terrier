	<brief_title>Apatinib Combined With Docetaxel Monotherapy Second-line Therapy Advanced EGFR WT , Non-squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order seek high-efficiency , low-toxicity anti-angiogenic drug , Jiangsu Hengrui Medical Co. , Ltd develop efficient VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) - Apatinib . This drug work mainly inhibit VEGFR2 produce anti-angiogenic effect treat malignant tumor . Apatinib show good tumor growth-inhibiting activity lung cancer vivo vitro experiment . This study aim validate efficacy safety Apatinib combine chemotherapeutics treatment advance EGFR wild-type non-squamous , non-small-cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
