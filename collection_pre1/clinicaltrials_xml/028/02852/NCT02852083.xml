	<brief_title>A Trial With Metronomic Low-dose Treosulfan , Pioglitazone Clarithromycin Versus Standard Treatment NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize 1:1 , stratify accord histology ( squamous cell carcinoma v adenocarcinoma ) . 86 patient platin refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) treat either metronomic low-dose treosulfan , pioglitazone clarithromycin ( experimental arm ) nivolumab ( squamous cell lung cancer nonsquamous cell lung cancer ) . Patients undergo tumor assessment baseline every 6 week ( approximately every two cycle ) thereafter , progression . Patients without progression 36 week undergo tumor assessment every 12 week .</detailed_description>
