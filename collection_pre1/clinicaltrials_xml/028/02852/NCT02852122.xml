	<brief_summary>The investigator determine target number 54 patient base follow reason : ( ) The bony metastasis rate high risk prostate cancer patient PSA 20 99.9 ng/ml 21 % ( 166/767 case systemic review ) [ 8 ] ; estimate sample size would 47 condition 20 % distant metastasis case identify PET/MRI scan use 90 % power , significance level 0.05 one sample proportion test . Assuming dropout rate 10 % , final ideal sample size 52 patient . ( b ) The newly diagnostic number high risk prostate cancer patient hospital annually ~70 , 6 patient month . It clinically feasible recruit 3 patient month 18 month since study begin . The study could complete 2 year 54 case</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>[ 11C ] choline positron emission tomography ( PET ) emerge modality stag initial diagnosis re-staging time treatment failure . The updated study show 11C -labeled choline derivative seem promise PET radionuclides assessment prostate cancer USA FDA approve utility C-11 Choline prostate cancer patient 2012 September . To best literature search , preliminary study regard application PET/MR prostate cancer patient initial result correlation functional MRI PET image seem promise . Combined PET/MRI image advantage give anatomical , functional , metabolic information single image set provide comprehensive survey include local regional extension systemic metastasis . Unlike USA 70 % prostate cancer patient diagnose early stage , prostate cancer patient Taiwan diagnose advanced stage high PSA T3-4 disease , even systemic metastasis . The need implement good staging modality even urgently need Taiwan USA related study still lack . In current study , hypothesis C-11 Choline PET/MRI good modality stag high risk prostate cancer patient , predict patient ' outcome treatment . Our hypothesis examine clinical study .</detailed_description>
