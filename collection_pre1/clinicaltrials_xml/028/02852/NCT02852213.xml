	<brief_summary>The overall objective study determine safety efficacy AAV2-hAADC deliver substantia nigra par compacta ( SNc ) ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) child aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase ( AADC ) deficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single-Stage , Adaptive , Open-label , Dose Escalation Safety Efficacy Study AADC Deficiency Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study specifically address : - Safety , measure adverse event ( AEs ) , safety laboratory test , brain imaging , relationship AEs study/surgical procedure AAV2 hAADC . - Clinical response treatment AAV2-hAADC . The primary clinical outcome reflect predominant motor deficit loss motor function dystonic movement . Primary Endpoints Safety : Assessment AE severe AE ( SAE ) relationship study surgery , infusion , treatment effect ( grade definite , probable , possible , unlikely unrelated ) . - Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events - Post-operative MRI and/or CT ( contrast clinically indicate ) - Clinical laboratory assessment ( hematology , chemistry , immunology ) Biological Activity : Demonstration effective restoration AADC function assay cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) neurotransmitter metabolites 18-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( F-DOPA ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . Secondary Exploratory Endpoints To obtain preliminary data clinical response assess magnitude variability change specific outcome . The principal clinical outcome measure : - Motor function , assess Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM-88 ) - Frequency oculogyric episode , measure Symptom Diary Secondary clinical outcome measure include : • Assessment subject disability , assess use Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory ( PEDI ) ; adaptive behavior , assess use Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale ; Patient 's Global Impression Change ( PGI-C ) ; quality life , determine use Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL ) . Although investigator recognize utility establish developmental cognitive assessment may limit study population 's severe physical disability , investigator use follow : - Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2nd edition ( PDMS-2 ) - Bayley Scales Infant Development , 3rd edition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Definite diagnosis AADC deficiency , confirm least two follow criterion : ( 1 ) CSF neurotransmitter profile demonstrate reduce HVA 5HIAA , elevate 3OMD concentration ; ( 2 ) Plasma AADC activity less equal 5 pmol/min/mL ; ( 3 ) Molecular genetic confirmation homozygous compound heterozygous mutation dopa decarboxylase ( DDC ) , ( 4 ) imaging finding consistent diagnosis AADC deficiency . 2 . Age 5 year 18 year ( note : minimum age first 3 patient 5 year ) . 3 . Failed derive adequate benefit standard medical therapy ( dopamine agonist , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , pyridoxine relate form Vitamin B6 ) . 4 . Unable ambulate independently ( without assistive device ) 5 . Cranium sufficiently develop , suture close , enable surgical placement SmartFrame® system skull MRIguided stereotactic targeting . 6 . Brain MRI within past 2 year show condition malformation clinically significant respect risk stereotactic brain surgery . 7 . Parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) subject must agree comply requirement study , include need frequent prolong followup . 8 . Parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) custody subject must give consent subject enroll study . 9 . Stable medication regimen treatment AADC deficiency : ( i.e . new medication introduce least 6 month , exist medication dose change least 3 month prior Baseline ) . 10 . Baseline hematology , chemistry , coagulation value within normal pediatric laboratory value range , unless Investigator 's judgment , range value clinically significant respect subject 's suitability surgery . 1 . Intracranial neoplasm structural brain abnormality lesion ( e.g. , severe brain atrophy , white matter degenerative change ) , , opinion study investigator , would confer excessive risk and/or inadequate potential benefit . 2 . Presence significant medical neurological condition would create unacceptable operative anesthetic risk ( include congenital heart disease , respiratory disease home oxygen requirement , history serious anesthesia complication previous elective procedure , history cardiorespiratory arrest ) , liver renal failure , malignancy , HIV positive . 3 . Significant musculoskeletal abnormality result chronic , severe neurological impairment ( scoliosis &gt; 45 degree , severe joint deformity , joint contracture ) . 4 . Previous stereotactic neurosurgery . 5 . Coagulopathy , need ongoing anticoagulant therapy . 6 . Contraindication sedation surgery image study ( SPECT , PET MRI ) . 7 . Neutralizing antibody titer AAV2 ≥ 1:1200 . 8 . Receipt investigational agent within 60 day prior Baseline study participation . 9 . Evidence clinically active infection adenovirus herpes virus physical examination .</criteria>
