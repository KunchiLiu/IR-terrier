	<brief_summary>Paravertebral block ( PVB ) show provide excellent analgesia major breast surgery result reduce narcotic consumption , reduce nausea , improve quality recovery , reduce chronic pain possibly reduce metastasis breast cancer . Traditionally , PVB do multiple injection T1-T5 transverse process . With multiple injection , risk increase pleural , intraneural , and/or intravascular injection . Recently , ultrasonography use facilitate PVB . The use ultrasound image enables real-time needle visualization procedure . This may improve efficacy reduce chance complication like pneumothorax . Currently , data compare ultrasound-guided single injection technique multiple injection technique regard extent spread PVB . Our objective investigate extent dermatomal spread PVB equal volume local anesthetic inject one versus five paravertebral site patient undergo major breast surgery . In addition , investigator wish compare performance time duration analgesia . Methodology : After local REB approval , 72 patient undergoing unilateral mastectomy without axillary node dissection randomize receive either single multiple injection PVB . The PVB perform prone position real-time ultrasound guidance use para-sagittal approach.The patient single injection group receive single injection PVB T3-T4 level 25 ml 0.5 % ropivacaine four subcutaneous sham injection . Patients multiple injection group receive five injection PVB T1 T5 level . 5 ml 0.5 % ropivacaine inject level . Pleural drift use sign correct needle tip location local anaesthetic spread . The pinprick method use assess extent dermatomal blockade , 20 minute follow completion procedure . All patient receive standardize general anesthesia surgery . Any adverse event include pneumothorax , epidural spread , LA toxicity/seizure , total spinal , record .</brief_summary>
