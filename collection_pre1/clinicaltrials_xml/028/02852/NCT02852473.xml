	<brief_summary>This study involve breathe motion assessment healthy subject continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) administration use MRI image . The hypothesis study CPAP administration significantly reduce breathe motion . This may help cancer patient undergo proton radiotherapy , possibly hold breath procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Breathing Motion Amplitude</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive technique tumor motion reduction involve free-breathing patient significant relevance context radiation therapy , particular proton radiotherapy . Tumor motion reduction favorable implication reduction radiation dose adjacent healthy organ , radiation plan robustness ( accuracy/quality ) treatment efficiency ( reduction treatment time ) . Using non-ionizing MRI volunteer , investigator determine extent continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) reduce breathe motion ( diaphragmatic excursion ) . The researcher also investigate parameter space associate breathe motion reduction versus amount pressure apply , well time initiation CPAP relation image time point ( address whether initial transient breathe state exists ) .</detailed_description>
