If PCR-characterisation perform , case ESBL-production identify use standard phenotypic method may include . - For carbapenemase-producers : case carbapenemase characterise PCR include . Overall , avoid selection bias , consecutive case accord previous criterion include . Variables A common , online database design . Access database restrict authorized researcher use individual user name password . Main outcome variable : Cure rate day 14 all-cause mortality day 30 . For safety issue , frequency type renal liver toxicity . Secondary outcome variable : Mortality 72 hour , 7 , 14 90 day , clinical improvement 72 hour , clinical cure day 28 . Renal liver toxicity serious adverse event . Explanatory variable : - Demographics - Use antibiotic within 30 day BSI . - Severity chronic underlying condition : McCabe Charlson index - Acute severity underlie disease : Pitt score day BSI . - Type acquisition - Source BSI - Severity SIRS presentation - Microorganism , MICs , clinical category ( Susceptible , Intermediate , Resistant ) , guideline ( CLSI EUCAST ) , mechanisms resistance study . - Empirical therapy - Definitive therapy - Bacteremia Source Control : drainage within first four day , removal prosthetic material , removal infect catheter , etc . - Renal function bacteremia occur ( Creatinine clearance ) . - Selective Intestinal Decontamination ( SID ) previous 12 month type SID ( drug use ) . - Variables relate transplantation : - Type SOT - Day transplantation - Acute rejection within 30 day BSI - Leukopenia ( number lymphocyte , lymphocyte subpopulation , immunoglobulin complement ) . - Basal immunosuppression - Induction immunosuppression - Prophylaxis TMP/SMX within 30 day BSI - Surgical reoperation . - Urinary catheter . - Urinary stenosis ( renal ) - Biliary stenosis ( liver ) - Traqueal stenosis ( lung ) - Post-transplant dialysis within 30 day BSI - CMV replication within 30 day BSI - CMV disease within 30 day BSI - Mechanical ventilation - Other underlining condition Definitions - Clinically significant bacteremia : bacteremia occur patient fulfils criterion systemic inflammatory response ( see , sepsis criterion ) . - Charlson index : punctuation automatically calculate fill data database . Alternatively , Pitt score previously calculate , may add directly database . For disease , medical diagnosis chart enough . Additionally , follow criterion use : 1 , Diabetes mellitus : antidiabetic therapy ( oral insulin ) ; 2 , Chronic pulmonary disease : disease lead chronic respiratory insufficiency ; 3 , Myocardial infarction : EKG evidence ; 4 , Congestive heart failure : NYHA grade II high ; 5 , Peripheral arterial disease : causing skin ulcer need revascularization amputation ; 6 . Dementia : significantly limit independence basic activity ; 7 , Connective tissue disease : require immunosuppressive therapy , 8.Liver disease : chronic hepatitis , significant liver fibrosis cirrhosis ; 9 , Kidney disease : creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min need chromic dialysis ; 10 Any tumour : malignancy require chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy palliative care . - McCabe classification ( modify ) . This classification chronic underlying condition ( acute condition ) : non-fatal underlying disease ( underlying disease relate death expect occur next 5 year ) , ultimately fatal underlying disease ( relate death expect occur next 5 year ) , rapidly fatal disease ( relate death expect occur next year ) . - Pitt score : punctuation automatically calculate fill data database , retrospectively collect 24 hour prior diagnosis bacteremia . Alternatively , Pitt score calculate previously , directly add . - SIRS severity - Sepsis : least 2 follow : temperature &gt; 38ºC &lt; 36ºC , respiratory rate &gt; 20 PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg , heart rate &gt; 90 , alter mental status , systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg , leukocyte count &gt; 12.000/mm3 &lt; 4,000/mm3 immature form &gt; 10 % . - Severe sepsis : sepsis plus one following : hypotension ( systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg , median BP &lt; 70 mmHg , decrease median BO &gt; 40 mmGh ) , organ dysfunction ( respiratory , renal , liver , neurologic , hematologic ) , hyperlactatemia ( &gt; 3 mmol/L ) - Septic shock : sustain hypotension respond fluid support therapy require inotropic support . - Acquisition . Nosocomial infection signs/symptoms start &gt; 48 hour hospital admission le 48 hour hospital discharge . Otherwise , case consider community-onset . If community-onset , episode consider healthcare-associated fulfilling follow criterion previous 3 month : hospitalization acute care center , kind dialysis , surgery , specialize home care , attention day-hospital , kind invasive procedure ( endoscopy , urinary vascular catheterization , etc . ) long-term care facility resident . - Source : CDC definition nosocomial infection use reference ; however , clinical microbiological criterion evaluate investigator may use interpretation . A source need microbiologically confirm enough clinical criterion present . - Empirical therapy : administer susceptibility report available . - Definitive therapy : administer susceptibility report available . If empirical therapy continue , necessary fill definitive therapy data . - Outcome definition : - Improvement : partial control resolution sign symptom related infection , resolution antibiotic therapy still necessary . - Non-improvement deterioration : clinical situation qualify similar bad comparison point diagnosis bacteremia . - Cure : resolution sign symptom related infection , antibiotic therapy longer necessary . - Dead : death patient whatever reason . - Renal toxicity : development acute kidney injury accord RIFLE criterion ( Bellomo R , Ronco C , Kellum JA , Mehta RL , Palevsky P , Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative workgroup : Acute renal failure - definition , outcome measure , animal model , fluid therapy information technology need : The second international consensus conference acute dialysis quality initiative ( ADQI ) group . Crit Care 2004 , 8 : R204 - R212 . - Liver toxicity : Patients consider hepatotoxicity present alanine transaminase , aspartate aminotransferase bilirubin elevation two time upper limit normal range . Toxicity consider severe symptomatic elevation three time asymptomatic elevation five time normal level . - Severe adverse event ( SAD ) : Any event become fatal life-threatening , produce significant persistent alteration ( accord Principal Investigator ) , require patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , produce congenital anomaly result overdose drug include stud . Any toxicity grade 4 consider SAD ( National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0 ) . Quality data Data approve sign responsible investigator center . It recommend data collector designate PIs Institution train Good Clinical Practice . All data centrally review ; query send miss data well data show inconsistency discrepancy . Data analyse per center ; center show significant difference average requested review data . Statistical Analysis Plan • Objective 1 : To evaluate efficacy safety different antibiotic use treatment infection cause ESBL- carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae SOT population . Separate statistical analysis perform group different antibiotic evaluate two subcohorts empirical definitive therapy , analyse separately ; active/inactive empirical therapy potential confounder analyse definitive therapy viceversa . To assign specific treatment arm , patient must receive drug accord follow specific criterion : - Empirical therapy : patient receive drug monotherapy ( except combination consider ) within 24 hour blood culture drawn prior availability antibiogram result . The antibiotic must administer least 48 hour , single exception patient die 48 hour , include death occur 1 complete day therapy assign regimen ( otherwise exclude ) . - Definitive therapy : drug administer monotherapy ( except combination consider ) susceptibility data available When one drug use , drug administer least half duration definitive therapy include study . The primary endpoint variable , namely `` mortality cause day 30 '' , patient treat cohort plot use Kaplan-Meier curve compare use log-rank test . Multivariate analyse perform use Cox regression . The primary endpoint variable , `` Cure rate day 14 '' , analyse dichotomous outcome . Regression analysis use logistic regression model . Variables p value &lt; 0.2 bivariate analysis introduce model ( include relate transplant ) . A propensity score ( probability receive two treatment type comparison ) calculate use non-parsimonious multivariate logistic regression model treatment type outcome variable propensity score introduce model . Interactions treatment variable explore included model cause significant modifying effect . Variables select use backward stepwise process . Goodness fit assess throughout . The Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) use select final logistic model . The model choose minimize Kullback-Leibler divergence model actual data . The intraclass correlation coefficient calculate order ass need control `` Center effect '' multilevel analysis . If sample size sufficient , additional analysis restrict patient matched basis propensity score , also perform . Each patient receive one type treatment match one receive treatment type antibiotic evaluate , use caliper width equal 0.2 standard deviation logit propensity score . • Objective 2 . To compare efficacy different antimicrobial SOT non-SOT patient ( use match control `` non-transplant '' INCREMENT cohort ) . - Cases occur transplant patient ( Transplant-INCREMENT cohort ) control case non-transplant patient select INCREMENT cohort . Two control group define accord follow criterion : - Clinical variable : age , source BSI , severity SIRS ( septic shock ) , acquisition . - Propensity score receive particular treatment . - Subcohorts patient treat treatment compare select . - The criterion empirical definitive treatment objective 1 follow . - Primary endpoint also objective 1 , i.e . `` mortality cause day 30 '' `` cure rate day 14 '' . - A propensity score receive two treatment type comparison calculate obtain non-parsimonious multivariate model logistic regression outcome variable treatment type . Explanatory variable include age , gender , center , type ward , acquisition , Charlson index , Pitt score , severity SIRS source . - After univariate analysis , multivariate analysis investigate adjust association treatment type transplantation main secondary outcome variable perform use logistic regression ( clinical response day 14 ) Cox regression mortality . If time death unavailable , logistic regression use 30-day mortality . Logistic regression also use 72-hour 30-day clinical response . The propensity score added case ; also , Charlson score , Pitt score , severity SIRS , source transplant-related variable add . Interactions treatment variable explore included model cause significant modifying effect . Variables select use backward stepwise process . Goodness fit assess throughout . The Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) use select final logistic model . The model choose minimize Kullback-Leibler divergence model actual data . The intraclass correlation coefficient calculate order ass necessity control `` Center effect '' multilevel analysis . The analysis perform use R software ( version 3.0.1 ) , SPSS 18.0 software multilevel analysis ( MLwiN Version 2.1 , University Bristol ) .
