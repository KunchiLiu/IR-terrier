	<detailed_description>Objective 1 : Generation common European database biobank . The exist national programme collect data chILD three country ( France , Germany , UK ) enable consortium swiftly adapt current framework functionally appropriate pan-European web-based database biobank . Importantly , compatibility ongoing United States chILD data base development factor . Objective 2 : Continuous assessment implementation guideline treatment protocol . Our Standards Working Group convene regularly . Initial task establish ( ) specific diagnostic pathway , include detailed protocol gather clinical information , blood testing , image pathology ( `` Best Practice Checklist '' ) ; ( b ) international panel clinician , geneticist , radiologist pathologist review every diagnosis quality control data ; ( c ) detail protocol follow generate natural history data . Objective 3 : Recruitment carefully characterize cohort chILD patient . European wide recruitment interdisciplinary critical peer review diagnosis submit across Europe imperative . Each case give diagnosis independently ; firm diagnosis possible , review case periodically new information become available . During first year study , cliniciansÂ´ decision accord local practice outcome independently monitor assess . Objective 4 : Determine value outcome use chILD . We systematically optimize clarify relative weight large spectrum single composite clinical outcome ( use clinician carer score ) , sequential limited chest CT ( minimise radiation exposure ) , lung function testing , histopathological categorization lung biopsy , serum marker genetic test . Variability , reproducibility effect train reading image investigate . Objective 5 : Assess treatment variation use , deliver data define protocol link outcomes . This project analyse detail treatment outcome within subject use data collect . Analysis collect data enable u support definition trial protocol plan future .</detailed_description>
