	<brief_summary>The main purpose study characterize compare 3D shoulder kinematics bilaterally perform functional movement pattern test hypothetically replicate 5 main phase throw cycle . The test base diagonal D2 flexion ( early late cock arm ) D2 extension ( acceleration , deceleration follow-through arm ) upper extremity proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Shoulder Kinematics During Throwing-related Movement Patterns Tasks Upper Extremity Low-to-moderate/Moderate-to-high Loading Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 3D shoulder kinematics ( thorax , scapula humerus ) collect different group subject specific characteristic . To load upper extremity PNF D2 flexion extension direction , elastic tubing ( Thera-Band ) use resistance . Selection two resistance accord self-perceived ability subject consistently move maximal amount resistance ( color ) PNF D2 flexion extension test 15 30 , respectively . Each subject permit sample various resistance order assist select appropriate load , three practice repetition permit per resistance sample . To perform test , subject sit standard chair without armrest , foot low leg place another standard chair , position front chair non-testing arm place across thoracic wall , minimize participation leg trunk upper extremity performance test . Elastic tubing anchor stable base perform diagonal ( Thera-Band door anchor accessory opposite foot ) . Five repetition test side perform , two different moment ( 5-10 minute apart ) . A rate 2 second per repetition employ recording use metronome . A rest period give trial avoid fatigue . To perform test , subject begin/end hand contralateral hip end/begin head height shoulder width . A marker place latter position standardize start end hand position . The order test ( PNF D2 flexion extension ) side ( symptomatic/dominant asymptomatic/non-dominant ) randomize .</detailed_description>
