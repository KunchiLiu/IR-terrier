	<detailed_description>The clinical investigation gather impedance transimpedance ( voltage tomography ) data intraoperatively post-operatively used characterize electrical property live cochlea . The Surgical Assistant Research Tool ( SA16 ) research software software tool develop Cochlear Limited . The use SA16 research software current clinical investigation intend support Cochlear 's research development implant telemetry base surgical tool . The SA16 research software design perform series predefined measurement minimal intervention immediately follow electrode insertion use telemetry implant via Sound Processor computer . These measurement include real time continuous measurement , intend use electrode insertion portion surgical procedure , baseline measurement follow completion electrode insertion . The SA16 research software use current clinical investigation adult meet current indication cochlear implantation Australia . The SA16 research software use patient receive implant directly contact neural tissue , auditory brainstem implant ( ABI ) . CS19 ( 1.6.2 ) software use collect voltage tomography measurement post-implantation .</detailed_description>
