	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) common endocrine disorder child . In France , T1D prevalence estimate 12.2 per 100 000 . Worldwide T1D incidence increase rapidly last decade , around 3 % per year . T1D cause autoimmune destruction pancreatic beta cell , lead hyperglycaemia . T1D recently associate important loss life expectancy compare general population . To date , precise aetiology T1D onset mechanism involve T1D remain unknown preventive treatment T1D exist . It well admit T1D result combine effect gene , environmental factor gene-environment interaction . Several genetic factor report associated T1D , important human leukocyte antigen class II gene . Whole genome association study suggest 50 T1D susceptibility locus , confer individually modest risk develop T1D . Longitudinal study demonstrate low fraction genetically predispose subject develop T1D genetic factor explain increase prevalence T1D latter half 20th century , suggest implication environmental factor . Literature accumulate lot evidence role enterovirus T1D . Several retrospective , prospective , post-mortem human study , well animal study , strongly suggest contribution human enteroviruses pathogenesis T1D . Enterovirus probably play dual role T1D , enterovirus associate increase risk T1D others protective effect . Interestingly , several T1D susceptibility locus implicate antiviral response . Epidemiologic genetic approach lead new insight T1D causation , collective explanation still lack . The project aim ( 1 ) demonstrate gene-enterovirus interaction effect T1D onset ( 2 ) characterize `` precipitate '' effect enterovirus T1D follow-up study T1D high-risk subject ( first degree unaffected relative positive autoantibody islet antigen ) . A structural originality project perform family-based study gene-enterovirus interaction T1D use innovative robust method . This project conduct close collaboration INSERM unit , Inter-regional network paediatric diabetology , label biobanks ( CBC Biotec Hospices Civils de Lyon CRB-LRB Lariboisière ' hospital Paris ) , Centre National de Référence de Enterovirus Lyon Centre National de Génotypage Evry . The investigator first conduct 3-years pilot study ( 2016-2019 ) , base sample 250 nuclear family ascertain paediatric T1D proband four centre . Families ascertain hospitalization proband time T1D diagnosis . The study extend whole Inter-regional network paediatric diabetology . This research unique opportunity explore implication enterovirus interaction genetic factor involve T1D susceptibility aim target high-risk T1D subject . This innovative project open door development preventive therapy T1D .</brief_summary>
