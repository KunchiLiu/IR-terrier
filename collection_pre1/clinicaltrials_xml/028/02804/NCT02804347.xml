	<brief_summary>The sense smell cognition know closely associated mood emotional process . However , despite clear link olfaction cognitive process emotional state , research role olfaction , cognition , mood disorder far yield variable result . This study propose investigate ability detect identify odour assess cognition group patient unipolar bipolar depression prior receive schedule electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) intermittent theta burst stimulation ( iTBS ) treatment . Olfaction evaluate utilizing standard olfactory testing protocol use commercially available kit . Cognition evaluate utilizing standard cognitive test protocol functional magnetic resonance image protocol . The result potentially shed light link olfaction , cognition mood disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects ECT and/or iTBS Olfaction Cognition Patients With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research date indicate olfactory sensitivity cognition reduce depressed patient . The data also suggest high order cognitive odour evaluation , measure via identification testing , alter depression . Furthermore , research effect ( ) treatment olfactory performance ( sensitivity identification ) sparse . Researchers call study examine olfactory sensitivity prior psychiatric treatment post-remission . To best knowledge yet study effect electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) intermittent theta burst stimulation ( iTBS ) treatments olfactory performance patient treatment refractory Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) bipolar depression . ECT identify today 's effective treatment severe depression due remission rate , speed response , completeness remission . iTBS new remittent transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) protocol gain notoriety within field speed administration , effectiveness treatment , speed response . Unlike rTMS , TBS mimic endogenous theta rhythms brain , result great potency induce long-term potentiation synaptic connection target brain region . iTBS show effective treat mood disturbance , increase plasticity induce neurogenesis patient . People MDD often struggle cognitive impairment decrease executive functioning , attention , concentration , speed processing , work memory . The brain area associate cognition , prefrontal cortex hippocampus negatively affected depression ; study show decreased volume , activity , disturb brain connectivity two area . Currently , lack treatment option improve cognition depress patient . The investigator focus explore therapeutic potential iTBS cognition.The preliminary evidence study add scientist ' understand short long term effect iTBS treatment cognitive relate area brain use fMRI . The investigator also hope research allow psychiatrists deliver good care patient debilitate cognitive impairment associate depression . Overall , study examine olfactory cognitive performance patient treatment resistant MDD bipolar depression , pre-ECT/iTBS , post-ECT/iTBS , post-remission would yield valuable insight link olfaction mood disorder well cognition mood disorder .</detailed_description>
