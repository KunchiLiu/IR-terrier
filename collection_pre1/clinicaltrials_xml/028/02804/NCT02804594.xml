	<brief_title>A Study Oxidative Pathways MS Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1Background 1.1 Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis common cause non-traumatic disability young adult US . It inflammatory , demyelinate neurodegenerative disease central nervous system . Patients MS often experience various type disable symptom chronic fatigue pain . Most patient initial relapsing-remitting course develop point insidious disability worsening , i.e . secondary progressive MS . In contrast , 15 % multiple sclerosis patient experience insidiously progressive course onset . Primary secondary progressive multiple sclerosis think similar physiopathology . As , strategy manage symptom relapse patient may necessarily apply progressive disease ; however , symptomatic treatment trial do relapsing-remitting mixed population patient , neglect large fraction patient progressive form disease . Investigator plan address important clinical pathophysiologic issue propose study . 1.2 Fatigue multiple sclerosis Fatigue define subjective lack physical mental energy perceive individual usual activity common disable symptom multiple sclerosis . Fatigue severity correlate depression neurological disability . It impact substantially physical cognitive activity thus , negatively affect quality life many patient . There medication specifically approve fatigue multiple sclerosis . Many chronic inflammatory disorder associate fatigue peripheral inflammation postulate important contributor fatigue pathogenesis . A spectroscopy study report decreased N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio several brain region , thus point axonal loss possible contribute factor . In cross-sectional relapsing-remitting MS study , fatigue patient severe atrophy striatum , thalamus frontal parietal gyrus compare non-fatigued patient . As direct consequence unknown pathophysiology , little pharmacologic intervention available fatigue multiple sclerosis . Glutamate , critical neurotransmitter implicate excitotoxicity neurodegeneration , may also play role fatigue genesis . Two study glutamate receptor antagonist ( memantine ) report worsen fatigue multiple sclerosis patient . In addition , Investigator find compare placebo , riluzole ( medication anti-glutamate activity ) worsen fatigue patient early multiple sclerosis . This sharp contrast pathological evidence suggest excessive glutamate transmission may final effector neuronal axonal degeneration multiple sclerosis animal model . Oxidative stress due disequilibrium oxidant antioxidants central nervous system may also major contributor neurodegeneration . It unknown oxidative stress play role pathogenesis fatigue multiple sclerosis . 1.3 Fatigue rating scale Most fatigue scale use multiple sclerosis study primarily develop validate use medical condition . The two widely use self-completed scale multiple sclerosis research Fatigue Severity Scale , Modified Fatigue Impact Scale . 1.3a . Fatigue Severity Scale : This scale originally design identify common feature fatigue multiple sclerosis , lupus patient . It assess impact fatigue several outcome , emphasis physical fatigue . It compose 9 question response provide 7-point Likert scale . Scale score mean item score high score indicate severe fatigue . 1.3b.Modified Fatigue Impact Scale : This scale propose Multiple Sclerosis Council Clinical Practice Guidelines instrument choice assess fatigue multiple sclerosis . It derive 40-item Fatigue Impact Scale . It 21 item ass dimension fatigue Fatigue Severity Scale : physical ( 9 item ) , cognitive ( 10 item ) psychosocial ( 2 item ) . The scale score sum 21 item high score indicate severe fatigue . The scale show good reproducibility , ease use good correlation fatigue severity scale score . A cut-off value 38 distinguishes fatigue non-fatigued multiple sclerosis patient . 2.Rationale 2.1 Effect N-acetyl cysteine MS fatigue N-acetyl cysteine orally bioavailable precursor amino acid cysteine use treat acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity . The medication half-life adult 5.6 hour . As give twice three time day various trial document biological effect . It protect liver restore hepatic concentration cysteine glutathione ( GSH- major intracellular antioxidant ) . Besides antioxidant property , N-acetyl cysteine , increase intracellular concentration cysteine activate glutamate-cysteine antiporter eventually decrease glutamatergic transmission . Hypothetically , decrease excitotoxicity , may protect neuron different model neuronal damage neurodegeneration . Excellent safety profile potential neuroprotective property make N-acetyl cysteine attractive target examine anti-fatigue property patient progressive multiple sclerosis . Orally administer N-acetyl cysteine produce biologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentration N-acetyl cysteine dose well tolerate . One study show effect single injection N-acetyl cysteine blood glutathione redox ratio follow change glutathione concentration brain use 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3 patient Parkinson 's disease 3 control . Clinical trial oral N-acetyl cysteine wide variety clinical condition use range different daily dos ( 600 mg 6000 mg per day ) . The study investigator choose daily dose 3750 mg ( 1250 mg administer three time day ) , base good tolerability , treatment compliance minimum adverse effect report recent clinical trial . 2.2 Reason use placebo group There FDA-approved treatment fatigue multiple sclerosis . There also standard care various trial report inconsistent finding effect amantadine multiple sclerosis fatigue . Pursuant Helsinki Declaration , standard treatment disease exist , placebo generally use clinical trial . However , Declaration Helsinki support stance placebo acceptable set proven standard therapy exists : The benefit , risk , burden effectiveness new intervention must test best current proven intervention , except follow circumstance : - The use placebo , treatment , acceptable study current proven intervention exist ; - Where compel scientifically sound methodological reason use placebo necessary determine efficacy safety intervention patient receive placebo treatment subject risk serious irreversible harm . 2.3 Gap fatigue management Symptomatic treatment trial fatigue small , underpowered methodological flaw . As , draw firm conclusion make therapeutic recommendation difficult . Thus , fatigue multiple sclerosis remain difficult manage despite substantial impact patient ' life . An issue study fatigue patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis possibility increase fatigue disease relapse specific disease-modifying therapy interferon . There study focusing effect drug therapy fatigue patient progressive disease . Furthermore , study investigator 's knowledge regard underlie pathophysiology fatigue multiple sclerosis scarce future study intervention fatigue include biomarkers elucidate potential mechanism observe effect . The study investigator hypothesize fatigue progressive multiple sclerosis patient associate increased glutamate decrease glutathione concentration brain spectroscopy baseline . The study investigator also hypothesize fatigue associate change various oxidative pathway metabolites peripheral blood . 4 . Study Design 4.1 Overview study design : This 4-week randomized , placebo-controlled , parallel group , double-blind , single center trial effect N-acetyl cysteine versus placebo fatigue patient progressive multiple sclerosis define McDonald criterion . Subjects , enter treatment phase study , randomly assign either N-acetyl cysteine ( 1250mg 3 time day placebo ( three time day ) 4 weeks.There 3 in-person study visit ( screen , baseline , week 4 2 visit phone ( week 2 , week 6 2 week complete last study drug dose ) . Visits occur morning maximize consistency assessment evaluate main outcome within 2hours morning dose study medication . Questionnaires , research sample obtain neurological exam magnetic resonance imaging . Research blood draw obtain questionnaire completion . Brain spectroscopy obtain less 2hours morning dose study drug maximize detection biological effect study medication . 4.2 Enrollment site Enrollment start August , 2016 . Enrollment period last 6 month . Patients enrol trial University California San Francisco . 4.3 Study visit 4.3a Screening period : Total duration screen period 4 week . An additional 5 patient progressive multiple sclerosis volunteer participation clinical trial , screen modify fatigue impact scale score &lt; 38 recruit site 's clinic ( report fatigue fatigue scale score &lt; 38 ) , undergo brain image 7Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine , research blood draw . 4.3b Treatment period : Total duration blind treatment period 4 week . After screen visit , inclusion/ exclusion criterion detail eligible patient review study investigator . The eligible study participant randomize approximately 2:1 ratio one two arm either N-acetyl cysteine placebo . The treatment group assignment blind duration study . A week-2 phone visit complete determine tolerance study drug . 4.3c Follow phone visit : Two week take last dose study medication , fatigue scale questionnaire complete phone study coordinator collect safety efficacy measure study . Additional phone visit need complete 2 week randomization ass safety , tolerability , compliance study medication . 4.5 Study visit window : The screening period 4 week . The baseline visit need complete within 28 day screen visit . Week 2 phone visit +/- 5 day Day 14 , week 4visit Day 28+/-7 day baseline . Follow-up phone call complete +/- 5 day week 6 visit .</detailed_description>
