	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia constantly grow prevalence . Two main technique use today restore sinus rhythm : electrical cardioversion radiofrequency ablation . Radiofrequency ablation become recognize effective treatment AF . Despite relatively high success rate ( 80 % ) , substantial number patient require second procedure obtain sinus rhythm . Many publication lead study predictor failure ablation factor ( BMI , uncontrolled hypertension , size OG ... ) date parameter reliable usable daily practice . It electrical cardioversion . Despite relatively high immediate success rate approximately 80 % , significant number patient relapse arrhythmia short long term . Many publication lead study predictive factor failure ( seniority type AF , uncontrolled hypertension , size OG , mitral valve disease ... ) far result disappoint . In AF patient heart disease underlying , well demonstrate renin-angiotensin system ( RAAS ) strongly activate . In addition , well establish elevate plasma aldosterone primary hyperaldosteronism associate significantly increase risk occurrence cardiovascular event . The high plasma concentration also highlight acute phase myocardial infarction , heart failure associate increase major cardiovascular event rate , especially arrhythmias . In experimental model heart failure , demonstrate suppression occurrence spontaneous FA anti-aldosterone treatment . The arrhythmogenic effect aldosterone also show animal model . All result indicate potential role aldosterone genesis arrhythmogenic substrate FA . The hypothesis study aldosterone plasma level pre-reduced patient predictive recurrence risk atrial fibrillation supraventricular tachycardia ( flutter atrial tachycardia ) FA reduction , either use radiofrequency ablation via electrical cardioversion .</brief_summary>
