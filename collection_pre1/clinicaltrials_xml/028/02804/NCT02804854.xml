	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient often succumb acute respiratory disease ( rapidly develop disease affect lung ) . The lung commonest organ fail require support intensive care environment . However , accurate method exist use bedside tell cause deterioration person 's lung . There various example acute respiratory disease occur result numerous different cause , high risk death treat easily drug . When try accurately diagnose classify lung disease risk type respiratory disease misdiagnosed , miss level severity capture . By use field optical molecular image employ novel technique technology , investigator hope demonstrate bespoke chemical probe administer micro dos ( tiny dos ) directly distal lung rapidly accurately detect activate neutrophil ( cell immune system implicate development severe condition ) , work towards bedside test could use diagnose , monitor classify disease patient critically ill future . The population study intensive care patient normally intubate ( breathe tube ) due severity illness , may respiratory problem respiratory problem rapidly develop . Participants chemical probe administer lung picture take tube already place . As probe light come contact neutrophils investigator able tell neutrophil present . This inform large study 's hoped method use inform clinical decision . The first procedure take place within two day initiation mechanical ventilation direct contact study team complete within nine day .</brief_summary>
