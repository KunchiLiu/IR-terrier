	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate feasibility , safety , initial effectiveness ExAblate thermal ablation subcortical focal epileptic target area brain patient suffer medication-refractory epilepsy , use ExAblate transcranial system produce multiple sonications target lesion interest . The Investigators establish feasibility collect data establish basic safety type treatment basis later study evaluate full clinical efficacy . The hypothesis test : 1 . MRgFUS treatment subcortical lesional epilepsy feasible safe , low risk adverse effect evaluate follow-up period . 2 . ExAblate treatment subcortical lesion patient subcortical lesional epilepsy reduces seizure frequency .</detailed_description>
