	<detailed_description>Background : The clinical value early detection colorectal cancer clearly demonstrate . The evaluation 23 pilot county organize screen program colorectal cancer France , widespread throughout country 2009 , conclude result satisfactory improve especially term sensitivity participation rate . Epidemiological study show apart hereditary factor age , risk colorectal cancer mainly associate lifestyle factor . The World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) American Institute Cancer Research ( AICR ) publish jointly 2007 update scientific knowledge relationship nutritional factor ( diet , physical activity ) risk cancer . This expert 's report confirm , accord available data , risk colorectal cancer increase convince way excessive consumption alcohol , red meat process meat , among overweight people , especially excess abdominal adiposity . Conversely , practice regular physical activity protective effect . A recent meta-analysis estimate colorectal cancer relative risk factor mention , smoke habit factor related lifestyle ( obesity , diabetes ) . This information help consider development predictive score colorectal cancer . Objectives : The main purpose project construct lifestyle score base short questionnaire easy complete validate among participant mass screen colorectal cancer Maine Loire department next 2 year ( 2012 2013 ) . We evaluate ability score identify subject colorectal cancer diagnose screening procedure ( Hemoccult II ® , colonoscopy test result positive ) . Colorectal cancer primary outcome assessment score 's performance . The secondary endpoint focus colorectal adenoma diagnosed procedure . Our secondary objective test second weighting system , evaluate benefit term predictive performance add lifestyle score dietary factor among probable link risk colorectal cancer , determine acceptability questionnaire estimate cost-utility analysis impact apply strategy target screen use develop score . Organization : The project coordinate department Gastroenterology Hepatology Angers University Hospital . All data collect time participation organize screen program colorectal cancer . The management data collection do close collaboration structure screen Maine et Loire , Cap Santé 49 , part logistic organization already operational . The identification data specific project simplify use participant barcode Hemoccult test . To develop questionnaire adapt objectives potential future use large population , rely expertise experience French Research Unit Nutritional Epidemiology ( UMR U557 INSERM / INRA / CNAM / Paris XIII University ) . In recent year , team develop score assess compliance objective recommendation National Nutrition Health Program . The Unit also develop food frequency questionnaire adapt French population demonstrate reproducibility validity tool compare repeat 24 hour dietary record .

The statistical analysis conduct biostatisticians team Angers University Hospital . Expected result : The purpose tool ( questionnaire system calculate overall lifestyle score ) help general practitioner identify high risk subject general population , regardless familial predisposition , encourage people participate national screening program . Associated screen base age , strategy may optimize colorectal cancer screen France .</detailed_description>
