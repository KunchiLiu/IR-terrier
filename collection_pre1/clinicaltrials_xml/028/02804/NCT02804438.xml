	<brief_title>Establishing Normative Data Pupillometer Assessments Neuro-Intensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data collect patient intensive care unit select hospital patient assign , attend physician , regular pupillary assessment , staff nurse perform pupillary assessment pupillometer . While sample size estimate would consider inappropriate registry development , power analysis technique use examine potential registry generate adequate information begin fully describe normative data pupillary exam . Using assumption desire understand neurological pupil index ( NPi ) size difference within 0.1 , spread data would approximately normally distribute , minimum 3,250 observation require ( alpha = 0.05 , beta = 0.80 ) . It must , however , repeat simply rough estimate . The registry data generate , fact , source data future study power .</detailed_description>
