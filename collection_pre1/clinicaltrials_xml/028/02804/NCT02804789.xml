	<brief_summary>Brain change associate Alzheimer 's disease may precede symptom Alzheimer 's Dementia 20 year . The Investigators hope able identify Alzheimer 's disease early stage theory treatment likely successful prevent spread disease brain cause dementia . The aim EPAD programme develop new treatment quickly prevent Alzheimer 's dementia . A major component EPAD programme EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study provide subject EPAD trial well data improve understand disease dementia develop . The Investigators approach broad range people age 50 previously take part various research study consent recontacted research . Participants ask question assess memory cognitive function . The participant also undertake brain scan , provide sample spinal fluid , blood , urine saliva look marker bodily fluid may change Alzheimer 's disease . The Investigators follow participant December 2019 repeat test annually . This call EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study ( EPAD LCS ) . The main reason EPAD develop cohort help Investigators understand happen people dementia develops , help recruit people quickly EPAD trial new medication intervention expect prevent dementia . People EPAD LCS may invite take part EPAD Proof Concept prevention study see intervention modify probability develop dementia cognitive problem ( subject separate ethic approval consent ) . Together EPAD LCS EPAD PoC make full EPAD Programme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The EPAD project establish overcome major hurdle hamper drug development secondary prevention AD dementia , conduct EPAD LCS ( feed exist Parent Cohorts ( PC ) across Europe ) alignment adaptive design EPAD PoC trial . Both EPAD LCS EPAD PoC trial run exclusive network highly select , expert Trial Delivery Centres ( TDC ) select basis strictly apply criterion ensure high possible data quality , successful recruitment adherence EPAD principle . While intervention must start early course AD , accurate disease model cover entire course AD dementia onset lacking . Estimating reasonable confidence individual 's overall probability develop AD dementia define time period must take account multiple dimension simultaneously ( e.g . cognition , biomarkers , traditional risk factor - genetic environmental ) . This allow give individual place somewhere probability spectrum negligible probability high probability . Because individual similar overall probability may different contribution various component dimension , flexible algorithm need instead simple cut-offs identify probability-spectrum population adequate disease model provide sufficient number potential trial participant ( especially adaptive trial multiple arm test drug different mechanism action ) . EPAD LCS design address dual need development accurate longitudinal model AD cover entire disease course , development adequate infrastructure facilitate identification research participant clinical trial recruitment . EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population select already exist PCs across Europe facilitate fast recruitment . Different type PCs consider ( e.g . memory clinic-based , population-based ) . Due variety PCs , EPAD LCS research participant e.g . memory clinic patient without dementia , others e.g . participant without dementia general population . The variety PC settings ensure EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population cover entire continuum probability AD dementia development . Regular EPAD LCS follow-up clinical , cognitive biomarker assessment provide well-phenotyped probability-spectrum population , generate high-quality data update disease model , easy identification individual suitable trial inclusion , use trial run-in data reference evaluate intervention efficacy . The flow research participant population large trial divide follow stage : firstly , EPAD engage exist PCs across Europe may eligible research participant EPAD LCS . The next step draw research participant PCs EPAD LCS maintain suitable population approximately 6,000 research participant . Finally , research participant EPAD LCS fulfil trial inclusion criterion ( approximately 1,500 research participant ) , invite enter EPAD PoC ( PoC ) trial evaluation treatment secondary prevention AD dementia . This trial standing , adaptive , PoC trial could involve multiple arm run concurrently . Successful graduation PoC phase 3 confirmatory trial single combinatorial intervention base success intermediary , target specific biomarker success cognitive measure . Once recruitment complete , give time approx . 6,000 research participant EPAD LCS approx . 1,500 EPAD PoC , hence need replenish PCs participant lose attrition . EPAD LCS initially run end December 2019 , extension consent seek 4 year .</detailed_description>
