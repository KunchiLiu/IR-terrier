	<brief_title>The Efficacy Nasal High Flow Oxygen Therapy With Rehabilitation Patients With Chronic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient chronic respiratory failure , pulmonary rehabilitation recognize evidence-based treatment improve exercise capacity , muscle strength , dyspnea , quality life . Oxygen supplementation exercise induce dose-dependent improvement endurance symptom perception chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient . Recently , nasal high flow therapy consist high flow gas FiO2 range 0.21 nearly 1.0 adjusted oxygen blender , bring body temperature , saturated water in-line humidifier available . The present study randomise compare effect exercise endurance oxygen therapy rehabilitation nasal high flow therapy rehabilitation patient chronic respiratory failure receive long-term oxygen therapy .</detailed_description>
