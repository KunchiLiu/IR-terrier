	<brief_summary>This closed-loop system embody novel intelligent algorithm take account patient ' vital sign . The system allow well responsive titration personalize pain relief together non-invasive physiological monitoring measure oxygenation , breathe heart rate continuously .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vital-signs-integrated Patient-assisted Intravenous Opioid Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A glaring safety gap administration commonplace Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) opioids unfortunately exists . A significant proportion patient may suffer respiratory depression use PCA opioids imperative discover solution improve safety PCA opioids , therein improve medication safety , enhance quality postoperative care provide economic cost saving . Currently , continuous monitoring system integrate intelligent decision make response exists . The investigator primary aim develop commercialise Vital-signs-integrated ( use oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , heart rate ) Patient-assisted Intravenous opioid Analgesia ( VPIA ) integrate hospital-wide monitoring system capable make intelligent decision making response bridge PCA safety gap within 12 month . This VPIA delivery system closed-loop system safety efficacy . It integrate continuous vital sign monitoring , provide appropriate response breach safety parameter . It part large surveillance system provide tiered medical nursing alert safety parameter .</detailed_description>
