	<brief_title>Product Design Clinical Performance Study sc2Wear Furosemide Combination Product</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open label , single-dose study evaluate product design clinical performance to-be-marketed drug-device combination product ( sc2WearTM Furosemide Combination Product ) 70 adult male female Subjects previously diagnose mild advanced heart failure ( NYHA Class II-IV ) . The study design power achieve `` 95/95 '' performance test . Methodology : Each Subject complete Screening , Treatment , Follow-Up Phases outpatient basis . During Screening Phase , Subjects sign inform consent form satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol trial . Drug administration may start day enrollment schedule within 3 day completion Screening assessment . However , treatment visit n't occur within 3 day initial screening , subject may rescreened treat within 3 day rescreening . The Treatment Phase comprise preprogrammed bi-phasic 5 hour drug administration . Treatment Day observation commence pre-placement assessment continue device removal . Device preparation , placement removal perform study staff accordance product instruction use . Removal occur within 3 hour completion drug delivery ( 8 hour start administration ) . Subjects return 5-7 day Treatment Day post treatment follow-up photography . Blood sample obtain measurement plasma furosemide level prior start administration plateau phase ( 1-5 hour follow activation ) . After preparation skin device place upper abdominal area clinical study staff . Subjects advise avoid strenuous physical activity activity could expose device moisture swimming , bath shower . Participants inform marked diuresis may ensue activation , avoid travel , operate vehicle situation without immediate access bathroom facility . For study , 70 unique reusable component ( Activator ) use . Likewise , 70 single-use unit ( Cartridge ) use . Following removal skin , assemble device inspect photographed site staff . The used device ( assemble Cartridge Activator ) place sealed container return inspection measurement residual volume device reservoir qualify laboratory .</detailed_description>
