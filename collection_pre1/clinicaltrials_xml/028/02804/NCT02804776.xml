	<brief_title>PRe-Operative Gefitinib Resectable EGFR Mutation Positive Lung Cancer With Sector Sequencing Biomarker Discovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selected patient receive 4 week gefitinib surgery . A Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography ( PET- CT ) perform gefitinib assess response . Circulating tumour cell ( CTCs ) plasma Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) acquire baseline , 2 week 4 week gefitinib treatment . Resected tumor sectored detail study spatial heterogeneity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>EGFR mutation positive NonSmall Cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( regardless smoking status ) , control group may encompass molecular subtypes lung cancer e.g . anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) . All early stage patient NSCLC deem surgically resectable . All patient must histologically prove NSCLC , know EGFR mutation Patients fit either lobectomy/ pneumonectomy without lymph node sample . Primary tumour least 2 cm size ( Tumor stage 1b ) . Willing provide inform consent . Known severe hypersensitivity gefitinib excipients product Any serious concomitant systemic disorder , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's ability complete study . Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) pulmonary fibrosis ; impaired pulmonary function Patients prior exposure agent direct Human epidermal receptor ( HER ) axis ( e.g . erlotinib , gefitinib , cetuximab , trastuzumab ) . Patients prior exposure chemotherapy , irradiation systemic anticancer therapy ( e.g . monoclonal antibody therapy ) lung cancer . Any unstable systemic disease ( include active infection , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within six month , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , hepatic , renal , metabolic disease ) . Evidence disease , neurological metabolic dysfunction , physical examination laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug put subject high risk treatmentrelated complication . Patient serious active infection . Patients harbour exon 20 T ( Threonine ) 790M ( Methionine ) mutation . Pregnancy breast feeding .</criteria>
