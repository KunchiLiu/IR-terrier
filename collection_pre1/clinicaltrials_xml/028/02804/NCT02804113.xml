	<brief_summary>The VMI-CFA study investigate efficacy Supera Stent treatment common femoral artery stenosis occlusion . 100 patient include RF 2 4 . The lesion locate within native CFA treat predillation prior stenting Supera Peripheral Stent System . Patients invite follow-up visit 1 , 6 12 month post procedure . The primary endpoint study primary patency 12 month periprocedural event 30 day post procedure . Secondary endpoint include technical success , primary patency rate 1 &amp; 6 month , freedom TLR 1- , 6- 12 month follow-up clinical success 1- , 6- &amp; 12-month follow-up .</brief_summary>
