	<brief_summary>The use simulation medical education associate positive result acquisition knowledge , skill , behavior patient outcome . According Kolb et al , high-fidelity simulation provide concrete experience basis self-reflection , experimentation immersive learning name experiential learning . However important number learner extensive human resource require deliver mannequin patient-based simulation limit use initial repeat training . In general , 2-4 trainee participate scenario others may look progress scene video transmission neighbor room trainee meet thereafter debrief . In typical learning session , trainee act participant least . However , due increase number trainee , investigator anticipate trainee might remain spectator whole simulation session . In simulation unit ( LabForSIMS- Faculté de Médecine Paris Sud ) , simulation session third forth year anesthesia resident ( PGY3-4 ) Ile de France establish year ago . Each session include one-day train 4 different immersive scenario use high fidelity mannequin . Each scenario attend 3 resident . In year 2014 , number anesthesia resident train 35 could play role actor least session ( actor-spectator ) . In previous preliminary study , investigator find learn outcome similar resident end day , whatever scenario play scenario remain spectator . This lead hypothesis actor scenario might less important attend whole session participate debriefing . However , knowledge , study explore outcome learn process spectators-only . The number resident sharply increase 110 2014 2016 . Due time constraint limitation number trained teacher , investigator see inevitably , several trainee remain spectator whole session . The purpose study thus determine whether status learner ( actor-spectator v spectator-only ) immersive simulation impact learn outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Learning Outcomes Between Roles Learner During Immersive Simulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusions After ethical agreement , observational single-center open study conduct simulation center Paris Sud medical school ( LabForSIMS ) . After write consent , anesthesia resident Ile de France ( PGY3-PGY4 ) attend one-day simulation session include study . Four immersive scenario perform use high-fidelity adult mannequin ( cardiac arrest , local anesthetic systemic toxicity , malignant hyperthermia abdominal hemorrhage trauma ) . Pedagogical objective master include technical non-technical skill . Before train session , resident randomize 2 group : - `` actor-spectator '' group ( role actor least one scenario simulation session ) . Three resident participate scenario ( one playing role anesthesia resident , one playing role staff physician third call help ) . Residents involve scenario observe scene direct videotransmission ( role `` spectator '' ) . Actors spectator participate debriefing scenario . - `` spectator-only '' ( observer whole one-day session participation debrief part four scenario ) . Primary Outcome Measures : Evaluation learn 1 . Satisfaction ( Kirkpatrick Level 1 ) A satisfaction questionnaire record end simulation session ( Likert scale ( 0 10 ) ) . 2 . Evaluation medical knowledge ( Kirkpatrick level 2 ) Before ( pre test ) following ( post test ) simulation one-day session , resident complete test medical knowledge , indicate role . This test include 16 question ( 4 question per scenario ) , complete additional question unrelated program training . 3 . Evaluation non-technical skill ( Kirkpatrick level 2 ) An auto evaluation questionnaire evaluate self perceive non-technical skill record end simulation one-day session ( Likert scale ( 0 10 ) ) . 4 . Evaluation change professional practice ( Kirkpatrick Level 3 ) A questionnaire evaluate simulation program modify professional practice record end simulation session ( Likert scale ( 0 10 ) ) . Secondary outcome measure : Learning retention The questionnaire record three month session .</detailed_description>
