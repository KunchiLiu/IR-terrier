	<brief_summary>The National Heart Centre Singapore recently create biorepository IRB approve use genetic study : `` molecular imaging study cardiovascular health disease ( CIRB Ref : 2013/605/C ) '' . This repository enable IRB approve project within National Heart Centre Singapore access sample use biomarker genetic study consent patient study . The IRB approve biorepository process also allow patient , consent , approach inclusion additional study National Heart Centre Singapore . In study , investigator examine genetic variation gene know cause inherited cardiac condition also look circulate biomarkers ( ICC ) 600 patient ICC 500 patient ischemic heart disease ( e.g.IHD ) use control . Healthy control also use ( 800 ) become available biorepository . All sample already collect NHCS biorepository . These patient would recruit consented biorepository . This enable good understand heart disease Singaporean patient . In addition , investigator invite subset 10 patient ICCs provide second blood sample ( 20mls - 2 tablespoon ) top sample collect biorepository . The second blood sample use antibody biomarkers develop basic science laboratory . These antibody use develop new biomarkers human heart disease improve human health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In young adult child inherit cardiac condition ( ICCs ) affect cardiac structure electrical activity , account case sudden cardiac death . Of ICCs , SCD due Brugada Syndrome particularly prevalent SE Asia cause early loss life young men . While major advance treatment coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , heart failure ( HF ) acute MI , remain difficult identify individual risk SCD due ICCs even diseases run family and/or mutation know . This , large part , relate limited understanding effect gene mutation clinical phenotype due variation mutation penetrance expressivity . In Singapore , SE Asia general , issue mutation interpretation difficult , impossible , population-specific variant annotation limit completely absent common ICC gene . In addition , DNA variant important protein biomarkers heart vessel may equally important , remain completely unaddressed populations.The investigatorswill address issue case control use advanced sequence informatics approach generate novel antibody library use patient sample . Overall , research perform study find new way diagnose patient risk sudden death hospital environment also general population . This enable effective screen stratification patient risk sudden death due inherit cause follow myocardial infarction .</detailed_description>
