	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis multiple etiology share similar bronchial injury associate inflammation , lead progressive lung deterioration . This disease responsible frequent access care exacerbation rate 1.8 per year high risk hospitalization . Natural history mark recurrent infectious disease main prognosis factor . This disease associate inflammation rate lung well blood . Up , study describe comorbidities associate chronic disease hypothesis cardiovascular disease frequent patient . In fact systemic inflammation drive bronchial infection may increase frequency cardiovascular disease . The investigator decide conduct monocentric observational study define prevalence characterization cardiovascular comorbidities well marker accelerate age . We would like test hypothesis cardiovascular comorbidities frequent bronchiectasis may associate marker inflammation age . Phenotype lung disease include : spirometry , plethysmography , DLCO measurement accord ATS/ERS guideline . 6M walk test echocardiography also perform . Frequency comorbidities calculate data questionnaire well standardized exploration . Aging related manifestation measure : arterial stiffness use aortic pulse wave velocity , bone mineral density use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry . Appendicular skeletal muscle mass grip test also perform . Blood test also perform measure inflammatory marker , cytokine length telomere circulate leucocyte .</brief_summary>
