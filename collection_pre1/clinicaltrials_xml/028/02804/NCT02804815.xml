	<brief_summary>Add-Aspirin aim ass whether regular aspirin use standard curative therapy prevent recurrence improve survival individual non-metastatic common tumour . The question assess four different tumour type ( breast , colorectal , gastro-oesophageal prostate ) mean parallel cohort within overarch trial protocol . Eligible participant randomly assign ( double-blind ) either aspirin 100mg , aspirin 300mg match placebo , take daily least 5 year . Disease recurrence survival assess , along adherence , toxicity , potential effect aspirin ( eg . cardiovascular ) . There large body evidence indicate aspirin anti-cancer effect . Meta-analyses cardiovascular trial aspirin show short-term effect cancer mortality decrease risk metastasis , suggest role aspirin treatment well prevention cancer . Additionally , large observational study individual take aspirin cancer treatment show improved disease-specific overall mortality specific tumour type . In treatment setting , risk side effect associate aspirin expect outweigh potential benefit . However , yet assess randomise trial . As low cost , generic widely available drug , generally safe , aspirin show effective , could huge impact cancer outcomes globally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Add-Aspirin : A Trial Assessing Effects Aspirin Disease Recurrence Survival After Primary Therapy Common Non Metastatic Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase III , multi-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled randomised trial aim ass whether regular aspirin use standard therapy prevents recurrence prolongs survival participant non-metastatic common solid tumour . The trial four parallel tumour site-specific cohort ( breast , colorectal , gastro-oesophageal prostate cancer ) . An overarch protocol ensures cohort comparable possible allow combine analysis overall survival co-primary outcome measure addition individual tumour site-specific analysis disease recurrence survival . Participants undergone potentially curative treatment ( surgery radical treatment ) , include standard neo-adjuvant adjuvant therapy breast , colorectal , gastro-oesophageal prostate cancer participate pre-approved trial satisfy eligibility criterion . Participants randomly assign 100mg aspirin , 300mg aspirin match placebo . All tablet enteric-coated take daily least five year . Prior randomisation , potential participant take open-label 100mg aspirin daily run-in period approximately 8 week assess tolerability adherence . The trial incorporate feasibility phase recruitment feasibility , treatment adherence , safety use run-in period assess .</detailed_description>
