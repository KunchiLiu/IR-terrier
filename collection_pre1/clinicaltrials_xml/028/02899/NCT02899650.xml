	<brief_title>Rates Recovery From Strenuous Exercise Physically Active Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There well-conceived notion recovery strenuous exercise get slow individual get old age . Studies use animal model demonstrate stretch electrically-activated skeletal muscle mimic eccentric muscle contraction result great decline slow recovery muscular force old mouse young mouse . Similarly , human study use sedentary adult , age associate slow rate recovery series eccentric contraction . However , process age often confound coexisting disease gradual sedentary lifestyle progress advance age . Could old adult apparently healthy habitually exercise demonstrate slow rate recovery strenuous exercise ? In small-scale study , recreationally-active middle-aged adult display slow recovery unaccustomed eccentric exercise young adult . Masters athlete effective experimental model address question extrinsic factor ( e.g. , deconditioning , chronic degenerative disease ) often confound intrinsic age process minimize population . As study conduct Masters athlete , unknown Masters athlete would experience slow rate recovery similar sedentary peer . With information background , general aim propose study determine old adult healthy physically active demonstrate slower rate recovery unaccustomed strenuous exercise downhill run young peer . In attempt properly determine influence age regular physical activity , 4 group apparently healthy adult , include young sedentary , young train , old sedentary , old train adult , study . A total 60 apparently healthy men woman serve subject . Half young [ 18-40-year-old ( n=30 ) ] half old [ 50-80-year-old ( n=30 ) ] . After screen familiarization , investigator ask participant visit laboratory four time ( four consecutive day ) perform downhill run test physiological measurement ( muscular strength , pain scale , range motion , arterial stiffness blood pressure blood creatinine myoglobin concentration ) .</detailed_description>
