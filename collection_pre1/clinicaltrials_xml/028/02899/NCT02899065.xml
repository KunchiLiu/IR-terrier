	<brief_title>Evaluation Cepheid Genexpert Flu/RSV Assay Management Influenza Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine immediate availability Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Assay part stewardship intervention optimize antiviral treatment reduces antibiotic treatment pediatric ED patient suspect influenza v. standard care ( i.e . lack test Alere rapid molecular influenza test without patient specific treatment recommendation ) use prospective , patient-randomized design . Consented patient pediatric ED randomize two arm : The intervention arm receive Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Assay patient specific stewardship intervention ED visit . The intervention pharmacist-led include direct delivery clinicians information interpret test result recommendation antiviral-treatment high-risk patient , infection control precaution patient hospitalize positive RSV influenza test . Clinician adherence treatment guideline without educational intervention compare . Patients randomized arm receive nasopharyngeal swab collect nurse , physician train technician . The swab run ED train research staff process evaluation . Once result test available , print research team provide treat physician . Once treat physician review report , medical record label place report report place one HIM basket ED upload medical record . The second arm usual care ( i.e . test rapid molecular influenza test ) . Results delivered via standard care EMR . Physicians patient blind test type . Tests perform real-time basis ED . For group , data frequency duration antibiotic administration , antiviral use , adherence evidence base guideline treatment influenza , isolation , hospitalization , unscheduled return visit readmission within 30 day period collect compare .
