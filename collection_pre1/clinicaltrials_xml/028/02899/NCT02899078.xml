	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study well ibrutinib nivolumab work treat patient previously-treated kidney cancer spread part body . Ibrutinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving Ibrutinib nivolumab may work well treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
