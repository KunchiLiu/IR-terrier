	<brief_summary>Patients medically refractory epilepsy treat intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) delivery valproate use implantable drug pump system . The dose valproate escalate weekly blinded-evaluation period Day 64 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . After Day 64 , patient continue 52 week open-label evaluation period ( non-blinded ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Ranging Pilot Study Assess Intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) Delivery Valproate Subjects With Temporal Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy patient refractory oral anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) treatment significantly high mortality , high morbidity , high economic cost diminish quality life compare suffer epilepsy adequately control medical management . Current option refractory patient include neurosurgical brain resection , responsive neurostimulation , vagal nerve stimulation . None option satisfactory due low applicability surgery patient poorly localize multifocal seizure limit success currently available alternative treatment option . In study , patient medically refractory focal epilepsy treat intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) administration valproate use implantable drug pump system . This dose ranging study , randomize , double-blind dose escalation component , establish dose range ICV valproate delivery . Clinical assessment , adverse event ( AEs ) , seizure diary , concomitant medication , blood sample cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) collect review designated time point . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) also perform . Subjects surgery , dose change pharmacokinetics perform inpatient setting . The ICV Valproate dose escalate stepwise 3 mg/day 60 mg/day Day 64 tolerate , stop early upon establishment subject 's maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The MTD subject determine base high dose tolerate without experience dose-limiting adverse event ( AE ) . After establish subject 's MTD , delivery ICV Valproate continue MTD Day 64 blind evaluation period . Subjects assess physician remain blinded treatment dose blind evaluation period . Subjects continue open-label evaluation period ( non-blinded ) 52 week follow blinded evaluation period .</detailed_description>
