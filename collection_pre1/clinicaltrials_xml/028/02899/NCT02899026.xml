	<brief_summary>Sirukumab human anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody selectively bind cytokine high affinity may therapeutic benefit treatment polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR ) interrupt multiple pathogenic pathway . Sirukumab inhibit IL-6-mediated signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) phosphorylation , result inhibition biological effect IL-6 . This study evaluate efficacy safety sirukumab characterize benefit-to-risk profile sirukumab treatment active PMR . The study conduct 2 part ( Part A Part B ) consist follow phase : Screening phase , Part A : 52-week double-blind treatment phase , Part B : 52-week extension phase study drug administration 16-week follow-up phase applicable . Approximately 150 subject diagnosis PMR active disease within 6 week baseline randomize Part A , 52-week double-blind treatment phase , receive one two dos sirukumab placebo , addition pre-specified prednisone taper . The efficacy safety sirukumab sustain remission assess Week 52 . Subjects complete Part A study clinical remission eligible enter Part B , 52-week extension phase , design investigate long-term maintenance remission safety follow cessation sirukumab treatment ass long-term corticosteroid use . Subjects need follow-up safety evaluation least 16 week receive last dose study drug , applicable withdrawn prematurely study complete Part A eligible Part B .</brief_summary>
