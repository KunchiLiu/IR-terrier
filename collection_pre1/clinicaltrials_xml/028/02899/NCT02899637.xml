	<detailed_description>Effective rehabilitation program individual incomplete spinal cord injury ( iSCI ) require either acute post-acute care . Rehabilitation technique base protocol selectively stimulate specific pathway along central nervous system consider effective enhance neurologic recovery thereby improve functional ability . The rationale relies assumption stimulation corticospinal tract , primary motor cortex , spinal cord might induce neuronal reorganization structure largely involved control voluntary movement . In line reasoning , protocols involve repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) find effective enhance corticospinal synaptic transmission , attenuate neuropathic pain , improve spasticity sensorimotor function iSCI . However , controversial finding also report , study show unaltered central pain , well cortical excitability sensorimotor function . The lack consistent result probably associate difference stimulation parameter , number session , site stimulation , chronicity level injury , outcome measurement previous study . Thus , clear remain gap knowledge development new study , preferably prospective fully double-blind placebo-controlled trial , necessary complement current knowledge effect rTMS patient iSCI .</detailed_description>
