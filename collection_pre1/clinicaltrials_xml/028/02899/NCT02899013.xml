	<detailed_description>The perianal lesion ( LAP ) specific Crohn 's disease report 1938 , six year first case luminal disease . If phenotypic data latter well document today , perianal disease remain inadequately describe . The reason numerous : understated symptom patient , elementary semiotics proctology ignore practitioner , lack validate classification track violation challenge undertake clinical trial high standard proof view variable , etc . ... Moreover , impact LAP vary across study ( 10-80 % ) . addition above-mentioned reason , result also due different definition LAP use study , collection reference center versus tertiary center , potential occurrence time disease progression , great frequency case distal disease ( 12 % infringement isolated ileal , 15 % breach ileo colic , 41 % case colonic involvement 91 % case rectal involvement ) . Yet specific LAP well document factor poor prognosis Crohn 's disease . In practice , Crohn 's disease specific LAP describe UFS Cardiff classification . She currently use even inter-observer reproducibility never demonstrate . This anatomical pathophysiological classification distinguishes two type LAP : primary , specific lesion ( crack ulcer ) , secondary lesion , consequence mechanical complication ( stricture ) infectious ( fistulas abscess ) lesion primary . The crack often multiple , broad deep base may occur quadrant anus . They may painless usually associate sphincter hypertension . They constitute 20 35 % LAP . Ulcerations realize profound substance loss , base inflammatory tissue bank loosen , edematous . They often focus sub-pectineal portion anal canal extension height depth . They rarer : 5 10 % LAP . Stenoses either functional , due sphincter spasm reversible organic , short long fibrous membrane irreversible . They usually occur heal ductal ulcer abscess . They represent 35 % LAP . Fistulas may secondary infection anal gland Hermann Desfosses complicate crack anorectal ulcer . These common LAP : 50 70 % . The epidemiology non-specific LAP , ie `` non-primary '' `` side '' , Crohn 's disease patient even unclear . However , management lesion patient high risk incontinence quality life affect chronic disease subject special precaution . Prevalence hemorrhoidal disease , estimate 7 % recent study , probably undervalue . The conservative therapeutic approach consensus even though recent study show complication hemorrhoidectomy patient quiescent disease . Crohn 's disease patient also excess risk poorly quantify develop various skin lesion anoperineal : secondary lesion chronic diarrhea , fungal infection , contact dermatitis , paradoxical reaction anti-TNF , autoimmune disease associate , etc ... Finally , effect immunosuppression risk anal cancer Crohn 's disease patient ( without LAP ) clearly know . Several author demonstrate excess risk infection Papillomavirus intraepithelial neoplastic lesion anus transplant treat azathioprine risk degeneration severe injury , old chronicle . Monitoring could therefore necessary sub-immune suppressor patient long term currently recommendation . In short , specific LAP Crohn 's disease poorly understood although presence worsens quality life patient case , factor poor prognosis luminal disease . The purpose study describe set LAP ( include specific non-inflammatory disease lesion ) cohort patient Crohn 's disease . Study Objectives - accurately describe LAP primary , secondary `` non-primary , secondary '' Crohn 's patient cohort obtain data include : - The type injury - Their proportion - The treatment already - Their impact anal continence - Their impact quality life - Their field occurrence - The phenotypic profile associate luminal disease . - establish possible causal link certain lesion certain treatment . - identify injury possibly bad prognosis . Methodology - non-interventional study - prospective cohort . - multicenter recruitment . - Data collection two step : - In consultation : - initial , sex patient age - phone - tobaccological profile - potential obstetric surgical history - intestinal transit ( across Bristol ) - Data proctology examination ( nonspecific lesion classification UFS Cardiff ) - activity profile specific LAP ( PDAI score Irvine ) - impact LAP anal incontinence ( Wexner score ) - phenotypic profile luminal disease ( classification Montreal ) - activity profile luminal disease ( Harvey-Bradshaw Index ) - impact quality life ( GIQLI questionnaire ) - previous treatment , current propose amendment , Crohn 's disease LAP - serum CRP . - By phone , necessary , second time complete miss data .</detailed_description>
