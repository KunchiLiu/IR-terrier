	<brief_summary>The objective study validate prototype WeTakeCare- system real environment ( =end user home ) embed Work-Package 4 ( validation evaluation ) follow main task : T4.1 . Definition methodologies protocol T4.2 . First validation : concept assessment T4.3 . Second validation : functional assessment T4.4 . Third validation : real environment T4.5 . Final check Within validation phase III project investigator want validate content fitness information software WeTakeCare target group : elderly unprofessional caregiver . It run Microsoft Kinect-System , authorise Switzerland , accordance prescribe information . The fitness- information software contain information strategy device available case old person able perform everyday movement safe easy way . Aim train information software support elderly stay independent others help long possible . The mentioned software medical therapeutical treatment medical therapeutical product . Performed exercise present information highly regarded interest safety protection participant , serf prevent physical restriction damage . There minimal risk burden participant ; content intervention ( train basic motor skill , instruction strategy use assistive device ( partly ) compensate restriction ADL performance , enablement caregiver ) standard rehabilitation elderly . The investigator expect start third validation October 2015 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General study design justification design Type study : Validation prototype fitness- information Software : WeTakeCare ( pilot test ) pre- post design , comparators Duration : - Preparation validation study containing : recruiting , pre-screening , assess , instruct ( 2-4 month ) - Validation implies use system expect 3-6 consecutive month , start soonest October 2015- ( expect ) April 2016 . Population study : Healthy elderly ( aged 50+ ) mild moderate restriction performance ADL caregiver Number participant : Involvement total 20 couple Switzerland . Incorporating 2-5 couple first month allow detection resolution problem . Study phase 1 . `` pre testing '' participant eligibility 2. medical check 3. first assessment ( first part baseline measurement ) 4. technical installation system Installation system end-users home realized staff member ( See team member list ) ZHAW . 5. introduction participant practical use system ( second part baseline measurement ) To guarantee reality pilot conduct without alter environment except ` environmental elements/factors pose risk end-users perform exercises/ use program . The presence potential risk factor control occupational therapist , accompany installation system . If ` risk factor identify ( i.e . reduce available space front television screen ) , OT ` ( Occupational therapist ) ensure removal . If removal possible , alternate possibility verify case non-availability lead study exclusion . After installation program participant receive initial training function occupational therapist Weekly follow-up control also conduct OT ` ( Occupational therapist ) ( short questionnaire assessment improvement ADL capability ) . These OT ` ( Occupational therapist ) receive train WTC ( WeTakeCare-system ) use . 6 . Validation phase permanent digital log weekly measurement of….. 7. final assessment ( outcome measurement ) Methods minimise bias A description measure take minimize/avoid bias , include : Randomization , Blinding . Within pretesting phase possible participant screen validate cognitive status well physical condition include elderly caregiver benefit participation . STUDY INTERVENTION ( SPIRIT # 11 ) 8.1 Identity Investigational Products ( treatment / medical device ) ( ICH/E6 6.2.1 , 6.4.2 , 6.4.4 ; AGEK Checklist 2 , item 3 ) Enrolled participant get technical appliance support installation gadget . ( Kinect I ( Microsoft-Kinect ) necessary appropriate Laptop ) Occupational therapist give comprehensive instruction system , also include clarification safety precaution . The participant free use system within everyday life whenever want . ( Alone together caregiver . )</detailed_description>
