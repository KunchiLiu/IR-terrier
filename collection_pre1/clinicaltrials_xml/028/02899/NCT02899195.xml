	<brief_summary>Patients pleural mesothelioma surgically remove receive durvalumab , combination standard chemotherapy pemetrexed cisplatin first-line treatment . Durvalumab type drug call monoclonal antibody ( type protein ) . Laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer reactivate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . The purpose study see whether add durvalumab standard chemotherapy improve overall survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II MEDI4736 Combination With Chemotherapy First-Line Treatment Unresectable Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesothelioma malignant tumor mesothelial surface primarily arise thoracic pleura estimate cause 43,000 death worldwide year 3300 case occur annually United States . Approximately 80 % case mesothelioma due inflammation induce prior asbestos exposure lead time exposure development cancer 20-30 year . This single arm , open label phase II study anti-PD-L1 antibody , durvalumab , combination standard chemotherapy . Pemetrexed cisplatin give six 3-week cycle addition concurrent durvalumab dose every 3 week . The first 6 patient enrolled commence treatment monitor safety combination . Use carboplatin place cisplatin permit patient ineligible cisplatin due impair renal function screening , however patient must otherwise fulfill eligibility criterion study . For patient receive cisplatin , carboplatin may also substitute Cycle 1 cisplatin relate toxicity ( i.e. , grade 3 ototoxicity , grade 3 nausea ) investigator 's discretion . After completion Cycle 6 concurrent therapy , patient stable respond disease per modify RECIST malignant mesothelioma continue single agent durvalumab every 3 week progression . Maximum duration durvalumab treatment 12 month start Cycle 1 concurrent treatment ( inclusive treatment delay miss treatment ) . Tumor assessment perform approximately every 6 week concurrent therapy every 9 week maintenance phase . Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample ( i.e. , obtain previous procedure biopsy ) blood sample ( prior Cycle 1 , Cycle 2 Cycle 4 ) research also require .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria : Histologically and/or cytologically confirm malignant pleural mesothelioma . Unresectable disease ( define participant candidate curative surgery ) . Measurable disease , define least 1 lesion ( measurable ) accurately assessed baseline compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable repeat assessment ( modified RECIST pleural mesothelioma ) . Available unstained archive tumor tissue sample sufficient quantity allow analysis . At least fifteen unstained slide tumor block . NOTE : A fine needle aspiration sample sufficient make patient eligible enrollment . Given complexity mesothelioma pathological diagnosis newly diagnose patient expect core needle biopsy surgical tumor biopsy part initial diagnostic work . Age ≥ 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Ability understand willingness sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent . Willing provide archive tumor tissue blood sample research . Adequate organ function measure follow criterion , obtain ≤ 2 week prior registration : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm³ Hemoglobin ˃9.0 g/dL Platelets ˃100,000/mm³ Serum creatinine clearance ( CL ) &gt; 60 mL/min CockcroftGault formula 24hour urine collection determination creatinine clearance . NOTE : Patients creatinine Cl ≥ 45 mL/min however ≤ 60 mL/min may consider enrollment provide fulfill eligibility criterion , subject receive pemetrexed carboplatin concurrent durvalumab combination phase treatment . Patients creatinine CL &lt; 45 mL/min enrol . Albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) /Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Women must either nonreproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry . Women must pregnant breastfeeding . Patient willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include followup . Patient must involvement plan and/or conduct study . No previous enrollment present study . Patients may participate another clinical study investigational product last 4 week . Patients must prior systemic therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody , investigational agent ) mesothelioma . No previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab agent target immune checkpoint . Patients must nonpleural mesothelioma e.g . mesothelioma arise peritoneum , tunica vaginalis serosal surface pleura . Patients must active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Patients must mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Frediricia 's Correction . Patients must symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis require concurrent treatment , inclusive limited surgery , radiation and/or corticosteroid ( prednisone &gt; 10 mg equivalent ) . Surgery , radiation and/or corticosteroid ( dose &gt; 10 mg prednisone equivalent ) must complete ≥ 2 week prior registration . Patients must uncontrolled seizure . Patients must current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid .
