	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States . Recent clinical trial provide evidence screen low dose CT scan decrease lung cancer cause mortality among old heavy smoker . Clinical guideline issue USPSTF recommend annual screening age 55 80 30 pack year smoke quit le 15 year ago . Evidence clearly delineate benefit ( mortality reduction ) harm ( false positive , follow-up testing , risk invasive testing , risk overdiagnosis ) lung cancer screening . Preliminary data HSR &amp; D pilot grant find Veterans highly reluctant enter care pathway associate lung cancer screen due potential harm . Additional preliminary data use Best Worst Scaling old smoker demonstrate group patient place great importance harm benefit consider lung cancer screening . Preference assessment method help Veterans weigh benefit harm , consider clinical pathway entering , anticipate future health state , communicate value health care provider . Although basic educational tool inform lung cancer decision-making develop , lack validate preference assessment tool integrate clinical setting . Building upon preference assessment method develop validate HSR &amp; D pilot grant ( PI-Schapira ) use trans-disciplinary approach , team position advance science practice decision support lung cancer screen Veteran population . The objective study 1 ) elicit patient provider stakeholder input inform development lung cancer screen decision tool , 2 ) develop web base Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool ( LCSDecTool ) incorporate patient provider input , 3 ) evaluate impact LCSDecTool compare usual care decision process , clinical outcome , quality life . The study conduct 3 phase . In phase 1 , mixed method use assess usability preference assessment method perceive usefulness web base lung cancer screen decision support tool among patient provider stakeholder . In phase 2 , interactive web base decision support program develop incorporate preference assessment method . In phase 3 , pilot RCT conduce evaluate efficacy web base decision support program . Outcomes evaluated include decision quality indicate knowledge , decisional conflict , decision regret ; screen behavior , clinical outcome indicate anxiety , quality life . The study conduct across two VA site ; West Haven-VA Connecticut Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Results study provide tool use integrate lung cancer screen clinical practice VA Medical Centers patient center approach . Lung cancer screen fundamentally different exist screen paradigms several respect ; eligibility define behavior ( smoke ) , high rate false positive finding expect , target population older high comorbidity target population cervical , breast , colorectal screening . Given unique aspect lung cancer screening , critical need develop test tool preference assessment inform decision make applicable VA setting . The current proposal provide mechanism accomplish goal . The Principal Investigator work closely US Department Veterans Affairs National Center Health Promotion Disease Prevention integrate tool paradigm develop primary care VA Medical Care System . The work build directly upon recently complete HSR &amp; D pilot support area lung cancer share decision making .</detailed_description>
