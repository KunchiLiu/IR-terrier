	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk Prevention Among Night Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various cause mortality , death attributable cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) widespread worldwide . Despite major progress make , risk remains . Occupational factor shift work emerge potential CV risk factor . With around 15 20 % workforce engage nightshift work modern society obvious economic social reason , consequence occupational social inequality substantial . Compared day worker , report high risk cardiovascular disease ( estimate 40 % ) metabolic syndrome ( 1.5 time ) shift worker . The occurrence metabolic syndrome increase risk develop high blood pressure , diabetes cardiovascular event . Because characteristic night work potentially modifiable , preventive strategy could apply reduce adverse effect . For shift worker , recent guideline ( High Health Authority , 2012 ) fruitful literature propose develop regular assessment cardiovascular risk factor occupational activity , stress need expand preventive strategy . Moreover , recent French law provide opportunity implement preventive intervention specific monitor occupational physician network . However , whether concept define , exact content , method potential benefit unknown . The investigator assume individual advice relate collective countermeasure reference guideline ( apply worksite within plant ) could lead well improvement incidence metabolic syndrome compare benefit individual advice . - Research objectives Main objective : To measure benefit implementation individual collective prevention ( dispense worksites within plant ) metabolic syndrome compare strategy rely individual prevention among night worker , 2 year ' follow-up . The secondary objective study evaluate group : 1 ) Observance different type preventive strategy 2 ) Impact observance preventive advice metabolic syndrome shift worker component metabolic syndrome 3 ) Determinants promote up-take preventive strategy among night worker 4 ) The countermeasure could apply effective within company 5 ) Medico-economic assessment plan ancillary study . - Methodology This study design multicenter , cluster randomize interventional controlled trial , reduce incidence metabolic syndrome among night worker . Randomization perform 100 occupational physician ( volunteer participate ) , apply one intervention . 3056 volunteer ' night worker recruit employee regularly monitor physician routine medical monitoring . Two parallel group perform : control group experimental group . A two-year follow-up organize include check-points every 6 month . Control group : Every 6 month ( T0 , 6 , 12 , 18 month ) , standardized preventive individual advice focus cardiovascular risk night worker deliver occupational physician . Experimental group : In addition individual advice , preventive intervention dispense worksite carry . Counter-measures apply occupational health team improve work condition . By use self-questionnaire , medical questionnaire , medical examination , biological sample , specific follow-up preventive intervention , assessment perform . Study Primary outcome : Reduction incidence metabolic syndrome two group ( control experimental ) 2 year ' follow . Descriptive analysis accord cluster also group provide . Multivariate analysis , accord specific design study ( cluster ) , perform multilevel analysis marginal analysis . Given specificity self-employed people belong 'Regime social de independants , target population add . The medical monitoring individual prevention carry occupational physician occupational disease centre . â€¢ Expected result From implementation preventive strategy , investigator expect : 1 ) The health improvement among night worker decrease incidence metabolic syndrome ; improve quality life ; 2 ) A improvement social professional development night worker well tolerance night work , job retention ; 3 ) Behavioral improvement positive impact individual collective behavioral change cardiovascular risk ; 4 ) Practical action identify factor influence implementation preventive action ; 5 ) By project , investigator would like also determine relevant , practical effective action could generalize night worker preventive health public Policy .</detailed_description>
