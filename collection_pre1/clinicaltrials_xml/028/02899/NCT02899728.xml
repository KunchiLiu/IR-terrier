	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well olaparib , cediranib maleate , standard chemotherapy work treat patient small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , cisplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Olaparib cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Olaparib , cediranib maleate , standard chemotherapy may work well treat patient small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition cediranib maleate ( cediranib ) plus olaparib maintenance therapy small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) lead improved progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare standard therapy ( maintenance treatment ) utilize Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact cediranib plus olaparib overall survival ( OS ) SCLC . II . To determine whether addition cediranib cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide induction therapy add benefit response rate , PFS OS use RECIST version 1.1 criterion . III . To assess safety tolerability combination cediranib plus olaparib maintenance therapy . IV . To evaluate potential biomarkers clinical benefit combination , include tumor proteomic genomic marker , circulate level cytokine angiogenic factor , may associate clinical benefit . OUTLINE : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) cisplatin IV day 1 etoposide IV day 1 , 2 , 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive treatment Arm I also receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients Arm I stable disease , partial , complete response randomize receive maintenance therapy maintenance therapy . Patients Arm II assign receive maintenance therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO olaparib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . NO MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients eligible crossover receive treatment cediranib maleate olaparib upon disease progression treat investigator 's discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-4 month least 1 year .</detailed_description>
