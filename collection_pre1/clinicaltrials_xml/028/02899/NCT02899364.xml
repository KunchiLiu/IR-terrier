	<brief_summary>Rationale : cornerstone treatment heart attack procedure call primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) : cardiologist use catheter guide artery , mostly wrist artery , site narrow coronary artery heart open balloon . Thereafter small metal tube place site narrow keep artery open ) . However , heart attack still lead irreversible injury heart risk heart failure . The investigator evidence ( cell/animal ) administration hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , also make human body , show protect heart muscle organ damage cause lack oxygen result heart attack . Data human suggest sodium thiosulfate ( STS ) ( medicine release H2S body , already use treat disease , i.e . cyanide poison renal failure associate disease ) administer safely . Objective : evaluate sodium thiosulfate protects heart damage cause heart attack . Study design : single centre , double blind ( doctor patient know treatment patient get ) , randomize control clinical trial . A total 380 patient , age 18 year , undergo treatment first heart attack divide two group ( decided chance ) : 1 group receive sodium thiosulfate , receives fake medicine ( salt water look exactly like sodium thiosulfate ) . After 4 month patient receive magnetic scan heart evaluate permanent damage heart muscle . When compare patient group investigator say something effectivity sodium thiosulfate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction rationale : Despite recent advance treatment , acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) frequently result permanent myocardial injury impose increase risk adverse cardiac remodelling , diminish cardiac function development heart failure . Decreased cardiac function PPCI associate impaired prognosis { 1 } . In addition PPCI , cornerstones pharmacological treatment myocardial infarction ( MI ) include ; ( 1 ) treatment direct blood coagulation platelet aggregation inhibitor , ( 2 ) cholesterol lower treatment statin ; ( 3 ) sympathicus inhibition beta-blocker treatment ; ( 4 ) inhibitor renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system { 2 } . These therapy successfully implement last decade result substantial improvement prognosis AMI . Although PPCI tremendous benefit AMI , ischemia also reperfusion consider cause myocardial injury cardiomyocyte death { 3,4 } .This phenomenon refer `` ischemia reperfusion injury '' literature cause sudden restoration blood flow accompany intracellular acidity ( pH ) change calcium overload , cardiomyocyte hypercontracture , myocardial inflammation , oxidative stress generation mitochondrial permeability transition pore open { 4-6 } . Reducing ischemia reperfusion injury expect decrease infarct size , decrease adverse cardiac remodelling improve cardiac function well clinical outcome . The investigator expect substantial beneficial effect H2S prevention ischemia reperfusion injury . H2S third endogenous gaseous transmitter next carbon monoxide ( CO ) nitric oxide ( NO ) involve physiological mediator several body organ tissue process { 7 } . H2S synthesize endogenously enzymatic non-enzymatic pathway . A non-enzymatic pathway reductive reaction thiosulfate , pyruvate act hydrogen donor . Thiosulfate act intermediate sulfur metabolism cysteine know metabolite H2S way also able produce H2S , especially hypoxic condition { 8,9 } . H2S show protect myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury various experimental animal model ; e.g . reduces infarct size apoptosis attenuate cardiac function . Inhibition leukocyte endothelial cell interaction , neutralization reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reduction apoptotic signalling suggest additional mechanism underlie cardioprotective effect H2S { 5,10-13 } . H2S show attenuate myocardial ischemia reperfusion cellular , rodent porcine animal model { 7,10-23 } . H2S safely administer intravenously STS human . STS demonstrate detoxify cyanide poison 1895 dog , use human since 1933 treatment cyanide intoxication , use since eighty treatment vascular calcification end-stage renal disease , use prevent toxicity cisplatin treatment { 24-26 } . More recently , study show STS delay progression coronary artery calcification haemodialysis patient { 27,28 } . Hypothesis The GIPS-IV randomize clinical trial test hypothesis STS safely administer patient present STEMI , administer time reperfusion , decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury result reduce myocardial infarct size . The aim GIPS-IV trial evaluate efficacy safety STS compare placebo treatment myocardial infarct size patient present STEMI undergo PPCI double blind randomize controlled clinical trial . Study design The GIPS-IV trial single-centre , prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind trial . A total 380 patient present first STEMI include . All patient randomly assign , 1:1 ratio , receive STS ( 12.5 mg iv ) match placebo . Study medication administer twice . The first dose study medication administer immediately check inclusion exclusion criterion obtain verbal inform consent cath-lab . The second dose study medication administer 6 hour later , Coronary Care Unit ( CCU ) . The study take place University Medical Centre Groningen ( UMCG ) , high-volume centre experience care research PPCI patient STEMI . The primary endpoint base infarct size measure late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( LGE CMR ) -imaging 4 month STEMI , period remodelling heart expect complete { 29,30 } . LGE CMR-imaging well-recognized , validated , highly reproducible technique { 31,32 } . Total follow-up duration GIPS-IV trial 2 year .</detailed_description>
