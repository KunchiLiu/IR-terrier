	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best way give hyperthermia high dose rate radiation therapy treat patient prostate cancer come back prior radiation treatment . Radiation therapy , high dose rate brachytherapy , use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Hyperthermia therapy may make tumor cell sensitive effect radiation therapy heat several degree normal body temperature . Giving hyperthermia high dose rate radiation therapy may work well treat patient recurrent prostate cancer radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility combine single fraction high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy follow immediately interstitial hyperthermia treatment radio-recurrent prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess long-term toxicity . II . To provide preliminary assessment efficacy . III . To obtain blood future analysis immune response combine radiation therapy hyperthermia .</detailed_description>
