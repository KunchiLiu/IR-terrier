	<brief_summary>Introduction : Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TUPB ) gold standard diagnostic tool prostate cancer , though may well tolerate patient , 65 90 % still complain discomfort , weather associate pain . Therefore , manner improvement visual analogic pain score ( VAS ) satisfaction patient , aim study propose gas mixture N2O-O2 50-50 % , non-invasive , safe cost-effective method deliver analgesia and/or sedation , without need anesthesiologist . Materials method : A randomized clinical trial , simple blind , take place Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro , Niteroi , RJ , within two group contain 42 patient , divide conventional ( C ) , receive 100 % oxygen nitrous oxide ( NO ) , receive inhalation mixture N2O-O2 50-50 % self-demand valve exam . They access pain VAS , answer satisfaction task record collateral side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TUGP ) currently gold standard method use early cancer diagnosis gland , associate PSA plasma measurement . Although well tolerate many patient , 65-90 % men undergo BPTU complain discomfort , associate pain . For good tolerance , various method analgesia / sedation propose , nerve block periprostatic ( intraprostatic , topical anesthesia lidocaine EMLA puncture site , general anesthesia propofol remifentanil invasive technique . Inhalation N2O-O2 50-50 % self-demand valve propose study good alternative invasive method safe technique , cost-effective , promote analgesia demand , order increase tolerance painful procedure TUGP , regardless presence anesthesiologist . Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) self administer analgesia various procedure drug joint intra injection , vascular access puncture , flexible sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy , ophthalmic procedure prostate biopsy . In Europe use emergency care transport accident ambulance . The objective evaluate efficiency inhalation N2O-O2 50-50 % self-demand valve , compare placebo group . In addition , investigator evaluate side event adverse effect administration nitrous oxide discuss security procedure without presence anesthesiologist . Materials method : The trial do Antonio Pedro University Hospital , Niterói , RJ - Brazil . Currently , procedure perform hospital outpatient clinic , without anesthesia . Included patient undergo transrectal prostate biopsy guide ultrasound . Patients failure report severity pain unable inhale device Patients diagnose pulmonary hypertension , severe lung disease , cardiac failure NYHA 3 4 exclude study The free informed consent present signed volunteer participant , benefit research clarify . 84 patient undergoing TUGP outpatient randomize two group 42 . The conventional group ( C ) receive local anesthesia puncture site plus inhalation 100 % oxygen face mask ( standard technique use routinely Hospital procedure ) . The NO group receive local anesthesia puncture site plus inhalation N2O-O2 mixture self-demand valve An anesthesiologist monitor examination respect resolution Federal Council Medicine No . 1.802 / 2006 , without able intervene analgesia propose randomization . A visual analogy scale ( VAS ) pain 0-10 satisfaction form present patient procedure answer . The group receive mixture N2O , O2 evaluate incidence nausea , vomit , dizziness , hemodynamic change , fit laughter sleepiness examination .</detailed_description>
