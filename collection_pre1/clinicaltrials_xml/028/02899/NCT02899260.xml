	<brief_title>Using Peanut Exercise Ball Reduce Cesarean Section Rates : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , randomize control trial compare use peanut exercise ball labor patient compare use exercise ball . The investigator plan include pregnant woman age 18 present VCU Labor Delivery labor induction labor fetus cephalic presentation . They peanut shaped exercise ball place maternal leg either supine upright position labor . The peanut ball see link , similar ball investigator use Labor Delivery ( http : //www.amazon.com/Isokinetics-Inc-Brand-Peanut-Ball/dp/B0026N2JWG ) . We use various size durable , non-latex exercise ball . There small size ( woman ,5 ' 3 '' 40inches ) , medium size woman 5 ' 3 '' 5 ' '' 7 ( 50inches ) large woman &gt; 5 ' 7 '' ( 60inches ) . The length time use peanut ball quantify chart OB TraceVue software ( currently standard practice peanut ball use ) . Each patient assign number order start 1 . Each patient randomize use block randomization scheme pre-assigned envelope labor delivery team room start number 1 . Each participant envelope pull order number assignment admit labor delivery consent obtain . Exclusion criterion study include woman multifetal gestation , fetus breech transverse position , musculoskeletal abnormality mother might preclude proper position peanut ball . This study prospective , two-armed randomize control trial ( RCT ) interim analysis plan 50 % 75 % patient complete study . Using nTerim 2.0 , 2000 total subject ( 1000 per group ) need study power 80 % detect difference C-section rate treatment control group C-section rate 11.25 % 15 % , respectively , use one-sided test 0.05 level . The primary outcome observe incidence cesarean section delivery two population randomize , labor woman . Bayesian stopping rule , expect success futility , add study . Bayesian stopping rule advantage traditional type interim analysis . Specifically , use Bayesian frequentist ( e.g . traditional ) trial design without require statistical analysis study design alter . Additionally , study penalize additional 'looks ' data , case traditional interim analysis . A drawback strategy method use analyze data ( e.g . frequentist Bayesian ) different interpretation may come conclusion . The investigator plan conduct three interim analysis , sample size 500 , 1000 , 1500 achieve . At look , predict probability trial success , assume full 2004 subject accrue , calculate . The predictive probability define probability unanticipated C-section rate Peanut Ball ( PB ) group lower control ( C ) , measure assume full 2004 subject accrue conditional data obtain subject study already accrue . If probability small ( e.g . &lt; 0.10 ) , study stop futility . If predict probability current sample size large , mean likely Peanut ball group lower unanticipated C-section rate , study stop expect success . Predicted probability 0.95 , 0.90 , 0.90 interim analysis 500 , 1000 , 1500 subject use determine expect success , respectively . If neither condition meet , study continue accrue subject maximum 2004 subject . The calculation predictive probability slightly different futility trial success . For futility analysis , posterior distribution unanticipated C-section specify beta distribution Xig +1 Nig - Xig +1 degree freedom ( Beta ( Xig +1 , Nig - Xig +1 ) ) , Xig denote total number unanticipated C-sections group g ( PB , C ) assessment ( 1,2,3 ) total sample size group ( Nig ) . This distribution come commonly used beta-binomial posterior distribution use uninformative ( uniform ) prior . For treatment group interim analysis , unanticipated C-section rate simulate respective posterior distribution ( pigj ) , base simulated value , simulate number additional unanticipated C-sections calculate . This process repeat 10,000 time , iteration , total estimate rate unanticipated C-sections calculate . The posterior probability futility , P ( pi , PB+0.0375 &lt; pi , C ) accrue total 2004 subject calculate sum instance pi , PBj+0.0375 &lt; pi , Cj , pi , gj predictive probability unanticipated C-section full enrollment simulation j . The offset , 0.0375 , calculate hypothesize difference original power analysis ( 0.15-0.1125=0.0375 ) A similar process use efficacy , however , predictive probability calculate inequality P ( pi , PB &lt; pi , C ) . The investigator collect data , perform data entry review chart ensure accuracy information . Medical Record Numbers collect data collection ensure adequately review chart patient data collection.The investigator also collect information mode delivery ( vaginal , operative vaginal , csection ) , gravidity , parity , age , bmi , epidural anesthesia ( yes/no ) , induction vs spontaneous labor , gestational age delivery , dilation admission , fetal position delivery , birth weight , cord ph , Apgars , dystocia , length active phase labor second stage labor .</detailed_description>
