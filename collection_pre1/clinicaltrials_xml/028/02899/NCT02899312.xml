	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer ( PC ) third common cause cancer death men . Most patient localized PC cure surgery radiation therapy , 35 % patient PC return . Whether return locally distantly determine type treatment receive . Current conventional imaging modality limitation particularly low PSA level . This study propose use 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan target prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) detect body PC recur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective single cohort study evaluate diagnostic utility 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT detecting site recurrent prostate cancer , patient negative equivocal finding conventional imaging . Eligible subject undergo 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT BC Cancer Agency - Vancouver Centre . 18F-DCFPyL- Each subject receive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan BCCA - Vancouver Centre , part research study . Each study subject receive bolus intravenous dose 18F-DCFPyL . The subject rest comfortable chair 120 minute take PET/CT scanner image . The PET/CT scan take approximately three hour extra patient time beyond time need standard care . Medical History Questionnaire- Demographic medical history data collect either person PET scan appointment mail phone , whichever convenient subject . Follow-up assessments- Positive 18F-DCFPyL finding investigate correlate image modality and/or biopsy whenever possible . These additional procedure leave discretion refer physician clinical management patient , mandate study . The result investigation capture follow-up period , verify accuracy 18F-DCFPyL finding . 24 hour follow-up All subject request either return functional imaging department approximately 24 hour ( acceptable range 16-28 hour ) injection 18F-DCFPyL agree contact phone . The subject ask experienced undesirable effect follow administration 18F-DCFPyL , intervene 24 hour . The local site attend nuclear medicine physician make assessment whether effect likely relate 18F-DCFPyL administration . 12 , 24 36 month follow-up All subject receive three clinical follow-up evaluation 12 , 24 36 month follow 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT exam ass presence recurrence , presence recurrence confirm follow-up discontinued . The evaluation include chart review available imaging , laboratory test , treatment along review symptom . The data require obtain review patient 's paper electronic chart , supplement telephone contact need complete information . The treat oncologist fill survey determine clinical impact 18F-DCFPyL clinical management . This categorized 'minor ' ( change treatment site dose ) 'major ' ( change treatment modality ) .</detailed_description>
