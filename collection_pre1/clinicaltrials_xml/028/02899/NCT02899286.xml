	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Recombinant Human Arginase 1 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , non-randomised , open-label study aim evaluate efficacy single agent PEG-BCT-100 adult patient relapsed/refractory AML . Eligible patient receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion PEG-BCT-100 weekly disease progression , unacceptable drug-related toxicity ( y ) , allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation withdrawal subject consent . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) PEG-BCT-100 pharmacodynamics ( PD ) activity PEG-BCT-100 arginine depletion evaluate throughout study . Plasma arginine level , intracellular blast arginine level ( IBAL ) peripheral blood ( PB ) bone marrow ( BM ) measure specific time point . PEG-BCT-100 give weekly 1600 Units/kg ( 2.7mg/kg ) per dose three week ( Cycle 1 ) . If post-treatment IBAL-BM examine within 5 day prior cycle fail drop least 70 % baseline value disease response fail achieve complete remission ( CR ) complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) , PEG-BCT-100 may increase 2500 U/kg ( maximum tolerate dose report previously ) investigator 's discretion . Disease response assess within 5 day prior cycle accord International Working Group ( IWG ) AML Response Criteria . Safety toxicity assess physical examination , vital sign , blood test urinalysis throughout study . Adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) report accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 4.03 ( CTCAE v4.03 ) 28 day last dose PEG-BCT-100 . Immunogenicity response include anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) level neutralize antibody level assess weekly first 2 cycle PEG-BCT-100 , pre-dose cycle thereafter End Study ( EoS ) . Specific response predictive biomarkers circulate BM blast , emerge genetic marker also explore study .</detailed_description>
