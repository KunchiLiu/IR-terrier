	<detailed_description>Screening Visit Patients undergo screening procedure determine eligibility prior first PET/CT examination . For practical reason avoid unnecessary travel research subject , initial screening conduct phone , complete day first PET/CT examination perform . However , PET/CT scan do subject meet eligibility criterion sign consent form prior examination . All patient receive consent form mail , email fax , least 24 hour prior screen visit . Demographics Demographic data include date birth , gender , height weight information obtain . Medical History Concomitant Medications The general medical history 3 month study entry ( screen visit ) record screen visit . The medical history include procedural surgical history within past year . Cancer history record lifetime basis . Previous medication record 28 day prior screen visit 1 year cancer treatment . All concomitant medication start enrollment subject record subsequent visit PET/CT examination . Vital Signs Patient 's vital sign measure include blood pressure , pulse rate oxygen saturation , within 60 minute 5-15 minute administration investigational product PET/CT visit . PET/CT Scans Patients meet eligibility requirement entry study undergo 18F-FDGal 18F-FDG PET/CT examination BCCA - Vancouver Centre 's Functional Imaging Department . The two scan perform separate day must perform 1 15 calendar day . Each PET/CT scan require approximately 3 hour additional time subject standard care . The screen visit inform consent , perform day first PET/CT scan ( examination ) , take approximately one hour . Prior PET/CT scan , subject instruct take usual medication prescribe family physician . Subjects also instruct drink 3 4 glass water within two hour prior scan appointment order promote hydration facilitate urinary clearance background 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG . Subjects must fast 6 hour prior 18F-FDGal 18F-FDG injection , drink water . Upon arrival PET Imaging department , subject weight record prior 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG injection . A baseline blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation level record within 60 minute prior 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG injection , 5 - 15 minute injection . Each study subject intravenous catheter insert . The subject receive bolus intravenous dose 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG BCCA , dose 237 - 521 MBq 18F-FDG 119 - 261 MBq MBq 18F-FDGal , follow 5 - 20 mL normal saline flush . The subject rest comfortable chair 60 minute . Upon completion scan , subject free leave department encourage drink 3-4 extra glass water end day promote clearance remain tracer urinary tract . Overall , study take approximately 3 hour subject time . Each patient monitor vital sign , adverse event intravenously 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG administration . Concomitant medication ( ) also record . All 18F-FDGal/18F-FDG PET/CT imaging obtain study send centralize location DVD set re-labeling purpose mask patient ' identifier reader .</detailed_description>
