	<brief_title>Can Actigraph Used Predict Physical Function Intensive Care Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) often need survival critically ill patient , take long time recover . A number high quality study show patient experience functional impairment long period discharge , even year . These patient may suffer number negative influence critical illness ICU stay , e.g . memory problem , episode depression , cognitive dysfunction sleep disorder . These symptom see medical surgical patient name Post Intensive Care Syndrome . Physical rehabilitation important must start already admission , order regain function independence patient . This well documented effect mental physical wellbeing . Actigraphy new way quantify activity level continuously . It validate used ICU ass agitation sedation oncological , surgical even ICU population ass sleep . It easy use , non-invasive inexpensive . It wear like bracelet n't impair patient mobility ambulation . Another issue evaluate physical impairment choice method assess physical function . For study , investigator use Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool ( CPAx ) good validity clinimetric property easy use . Also , do part daily training develop specifically ICU . The aim study investigate in-hospital activity level patient ICU discharge associate physical function three month post discharge .</detailed_description>
