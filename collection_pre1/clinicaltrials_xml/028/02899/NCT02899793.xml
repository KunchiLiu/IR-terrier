Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : Endometrioid adenocarcinoma , serous adenocarcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , carcinosarcoma , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify ( N.O.S. ) . 3 . Tumors must demonstrate ultramutation ( POLEmutation ) and/or hypermutation ( due MMR gene defect ) representative primary metastatic tumor site next generation sequencing ( NGS ) Comprehensive Genomic Profiling ( CGP ) test . 4 . All patient must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 . 5 . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 1 . 6 . Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior receive first dose must willing use contraceptive 120 day last dose Pembrolizumab . 7 . Patients must recover effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy . 8 . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy treatment endometrial cancer . Prior radiation therapy may include pelvic radiation therapy , extend field pelvic/paraaortic radiation therapy , intravaginal brachytherapy and/or palliative radiation therapy . All radiation therapy must complete least 4 week prior first date study therapy . 9 . Patients may receive prior hormonal therapy treatment endometrial carcinoma . All hormonal therapy must discontinue least one week prior first date study therapy . 10 . Patients may receive prior therapy ( include chemotherapy , biologic/targeted therapy immunotherapy ) treatment endometrial cancer . All therapy must discontinue least 3 week prior first date study therapy . Any investigational agent must discontinue least 30 day prior first date study therapy . 11 . Chemotherapy administer conjunction primary radiation radiosensitizer WILL count systemic chemotherapy regimen . 12 . Patients allow receive , required receive , 4 additional line therapy . 13 . At least 4 week must elapse since patient underwent major surgery ( e.g. , major : laparotomy , laparoscopy ) There delay treatment minor procedure ( e.g. , tumor FNA core biopsy , venous access device placement ) . 14 . Have demonstrate adequate organ function . All screen lab perform within 14 day treatment initiation 15 . Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . 16 . Patients must 18 year old 1 . Patients prior therapy nivolumab , pembrolizumab antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune check point pathway . 2 . History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . 3 . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Patients pregnant nursing . The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week last dose investigational drug . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IV/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start ofpembrolizumab . Women must breastfeed . 5 . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal surgically sterile undergone definitive radiation ) require contraception . 6 . Patients know brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis exclude unless follow condition meet : Metastases treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression least 4 week treatment complete ( must confirm within 28 day prior first dose pembrolizumab administration ) . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . 7 . Patients exclude known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Patients exclude positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . 8 . Patients active autoimmune disease history autoimmune disease might recur , may affect vital organ function require immune suppressive treatment include systemic corticosteroid , exclude . These include limited patient history immune relate neurologic disease , multiple sclerosis , autoimmune ( demyelinate ) neuropathy , GuillainBarre syndrome , myasthenia gravis ; systemic autoimmune disease SLE , connective tissue disease , scleroderma , inflammatory bowel disease ( IRB ) , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis , hepatitis ; patient history toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , StevensJohnson syndrome , phospholipid syndrome exclude risk recurrence exacerbation disease . Patient vitiligo , endocrine deficiency include thyroiditis manage replacement hormone include physiologic corticosteroid eligible . Patients rheumatoid arthritis arthropathy , Sjogren 's syndrome psoriasis control topical medication patient positive serology , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) , antithyroid antibody evaluate presence target organ involvement potential need systemic treatment otherwise eligible . NOTE : Patients permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger ( precipitate event ) . 9 . Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Patients permit use topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhalational corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) . Physiologic replacement dos systemic corticosteroid permit , even &lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent . A brief course corticosteroid prophylaxis ( e.g. , contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( e.g. , delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . 10 . Patients evidence active acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , abdominal/pelvic fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , GI obstruction and/or require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition.. 11 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 12 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 13 . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year . 14 . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . 15 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 16 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 17 .
