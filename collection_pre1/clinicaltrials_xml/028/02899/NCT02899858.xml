	<brief_summary>Spinal cord neural circuitry exist lumbar enlargement make possible stand create synergistic , rhythmic stepping activity low limb . In past 20 year , clinician try reengage circuit stand walk low spinal cord paralyze human novel paradigms physical therapy , pharmacological stimulation spinal cord , recently - epidural stimulation spinal cord . Although stand step maneuver rudimentary best , human study offer promise restore control , low extremity movement spinal cord injure ( SCI ) individual . Evidence animal data suggest focal activation intraspinal circuitry ( IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation - ISMS ) would produce fatigue resistant , natural stand step activity human . To date , direct confirmation circuitry spinal cord bipedal human paralyze . Furthermore , map circuitry would provide basis novel intraspinal neuroprosthetic able restore control stand walk manner much physiologically normal tolerable stimulate individual muscle group . Proof existence spinal circuit man , ability activate control circuit first map spinal cord basis proposal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two study volunteer completely paralyzed ( T2-8 region ) undergo evaluation ISMS otherwise normal thoracic spinal surgical procedure . The potential volunteer ask review sign screen consent form prior initial screening . This ensure ideal two patient select study foreseeable issue identify risk minimize volunteer . The subject must stable , complete spinal cord injury involve upper thoracic spinal cord ( T2-8 region ) , otherwise plan undergo spine surgery involve low thoracic spinal cord . Subjects volunteer study undergo intend spinal surgery clinical team . The usual indication undergo surgery either correct deformity involve low thoracic region , stabilize low thoracic region due chronic instability degenerative disease . The surgery intend clinical treatment must involve exposure T9-T12 spinal lamina . However , exposure spinal cord dural opening would normally perform clinical scenario . The experimental portion surgery begin , laminectomy T9-T12 exposure spinal cord durotomy use standard neurosurgical technique spinal cord exposure . The spinal cord region map stimulate use ISMS effect legs measure determine circuitry exist potentially allow stand walking use ISMS . The research request subject specifically allow 2 hour extra time routine spinal surgery perform study .</detailed_description>
