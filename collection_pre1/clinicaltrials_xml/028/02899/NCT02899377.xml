	<brief_summary>This pilot image study determine whether molecular image 18^F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) , 11^C-Methionine ( MET ) PET/CT , salivary gland magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Dotarem ( gadoterate meglumine ) potential characterize quantify disease manifestation primary Sjögren 's syndrome ( pSS ) subject . This achieve assessing association consistency image technique study , clinical assessment ( salivary tear flow clinical score ) , laboratory biomarkers , histological finding minor salivary gland biopsy . In study , healthy volunteer enrol Group A pSS subject Group B . The subject require undergo screen baseline assessment include unstimulated stimulated salivary flow Schirmer 's test ; image visit ( Visit 1 ) ; sample collection visit ( Visit 2 ) repeat select baseline assessment minor salivary gland biopsy pSS subject ; follow-up visit . The total duration participation study 11 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>GROUP A : Healthy Volunteers Subjects PET/CT MRI : Aged &gt; =40 year inclusive time signing informed consent . Subjects MRI , without PET/CT : Aged &gt; =30 year inclusive time signing informed consent Healthy define investigator , medically qualified designee , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test . Group B : Primary Sjögren 's Syndrome Patients Age &gt; =30 year , time signing informed consent . Diagnosis pSS accord AmericanEuropean Consensus Group criterion Baseline unstimulated salivary flow &gt; 0.0 mL/min evidence glandular reserve function ( stimulated baseline salivary flow &gt; 0.05 mL/min ) . Systemically active disease , ESSDAI &gt; =5 point All Subjects Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index within range 18.5 35 kg/m^2 ( inclusive ) Male Female , one follow condition apply : A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin test ) screening , negative urine pregnancy test 47 day prior Visit 1 , day Visit 1 ( day scan ) , Visit 2 , lactate , least one follow condition applies : nonreproductive potential reproductive potential agrees use contraceptive method list protocol 28 day prior Visit 1 follow . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list informed consent form . Diagnosis secondary Sjögren 's Syndrome . Diagnosis another systemic autoimmune disease , apart pSS , include limited , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic sclerosis systemic vasculitis . For Group B subject , autoimmune condition associate pSS ( example autoimmune thyroiditis , primary biliary cirrhosis coeliac disease ) , include exclusion , describe medical history take baseline . If doubt please consult medical monitor . Subjects active lifethreatening organthreatening effect pSS meaning may able complete study visit accord protocol ( determine investigator ) ( Group B ) . History coagulation bleeding disorder would increase risk minor salivary gland biopsy ( example , limited , Hemophilia A B , Von Willibrand 's disease , platelet function disorder ; Group B ) . History malignancy within 5 year screen , view investigator , consultation medical monitor require , could confound result 18FFDG PET/CT scan ( include lymphoma associate pSS ) . This include cervical carcinoma situ nonmelanoma skin malignancy treat curative surgical treatment . History unresolved acute chronic infection , view investigator consultation medial monitor , require , could confound result 18FFDG PET/CT . Subject diabetes mellitus require insulin therapy Contraindications MRI scanning ( assessed MRI safety questionnaire ) . History , suffers , claustrophobia feel unable lie still PET MRI scanner period 1 2 hour . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500mL within 56 day period . Previous inclusion research protocol involve nuclear medicine , PET radiological investigation , result occupational exposure significant radiation burden ( significant radiation burden define 10mSv addition natural background radiation , previous 3 year include dose study ) . A clinical procedure subject receive direct benefit ( eg diagnostic test ) include calculation exposure . Lack adequate peripheral venous access cannulation . Current participation study investigational product , recent participation within 5 half life discontinuation drug , within twice duration biological effect drug , whichever long Group A : Healthy volunteer Subject unable refrain take prescription nonprescription drug ( include vitamin dietary herbal supplement ) , within 7 day prior Visit 1 completion Visit 2 , unless opinion investigator Sponsor medication interfere study . Group B : pSS subject take immunomodulatory treatment screen exclude unless stable dos medicine 6 week prior Screening/Baseline expect remain stable dos medication Follow visit . This would include drug glucocorticoid , immunosuppressive agent ( example , hydroxychloroquine , azathioprine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , biologic therapy ) . If doubt , discuss Medical Monitor . Group B : pSS subject receive treatment anticoagulant medication , include limited warfarin , heparin , thrombin inhibitor , Factor Xa inhibitor , aspirin , unless subject able discontinue medication one week prior minor salivary gland biopsy , accord local guideline . The treatment may restart 3 day biopsy , accord local guideline . History alcohol , prescription nonprescription drug abuse could interfere participation trial accord protocol , opinion investigator impact physical mental wellbeing subject History allergy/hypersensitivity study medication include local anesthesia ( Group B ) , radioisotopes gadoliniumcontaining contrast agent ( subject ) . Contraindications gadoliniumcontaining contrast agent accordance product label local guideline Estimated GFR ( Modification Diet Renal Disease calculation ) less 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 screening . Platelet count laboratory normal range screening , prothrombin time laboratory normal range screening ( Group B ) . Subject fast blood sugar &gt; 11.1 millimoles ( mmol ) /Liters ( L ) screening ( define fast minimum 6 hour , exclude unflavored water ) .</criteria>
