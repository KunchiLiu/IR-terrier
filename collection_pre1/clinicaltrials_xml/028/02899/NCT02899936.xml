	<brief_summary>The DOLF Triple Drug Therapy Lymphatic Filariasis study determine frequency , type severity adverse event follow triple-drug therapy ( IVM+DEC+ALB , IDA ) compare standard two-drug treatment ( DEC+ALB , DA ) infect uninfected individual community 5 different country . The objective acquire safety , efficacy , acceptability data assess safety acceptability IDA drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Death Onchocerciasis Lymphatic Filariasis ( DOLF ) Triple Drug Therapy Lymphatic Filariasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2000 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) launch Global Programme Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) eliminate lymphatic filariasis public health problem 2020 . To interrupt transmission , WHO recommend therapy use combination two medicine deliver entire at-risk population strategy know mass drug administration . Ivermectin ( IVM ) albendazole ( ALB ) administer area onchocerciasis co-endemic ; diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) albendazole ( ALB ) administer area onchocerciasis co-endemic . Results pilot study Papua New Guinea suggest triple drug therapy ( ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine albendazole ) superior currently recommend two-drug regimen ( DEC+ALB , DA ) . A single dose triple therapy ( IVM+DEC+ALB , IDA ) rapidly achieve complete clearance Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae blood 12 individual least one year post-treatment . All six individual test 24 month still amicrofilaremic , suggest triple therapy might permanently sterilize adult filarial worm . Many people treat study experience transient systemic adverse event commonly associate diethylcarbamazine ivermectin treatment filariasis . Adverse event frequent triple therapy usual combination two drug . However , serious adverse event observe . The dramatic reduction sustain decrease microfilaria along safety profile see Papua New Guinea study suggest triple drug therapy may useful tool achieve goal eliminate lymphatic filariasis public health problem 2020 . Although study cite clearly demonstrate superiority triple therapy clear W. bancrofti microfilaria blood , safety efficacy data need triple therapy roll large scale mass drug administration regimen lymphatic filariasis endemic country . WHO recommend best practice call `` cohort event monitoring '' demonstrate safety new drug regimens public health program use . Establishing safety methodology require pre post treatment assessment least 10,000 people treated triple therapy across multiple setting . It therefore propose conduct cohort event monitoring study acquire safety data . Efficacy acceptability component also include study . Similar study conduct simultaneously Haiti , India , Indonesia , Papua New Guinea Sri Lanka reach 10,000 people necessary assess safety new drug combination . This open label , two-armed study . The two arm ( 1 ) mass drug administration ( MDA ) currently use combination two-drug regimen ( DA ) ( 2 ) MDA triple drug therapy ( IDA ) .</detailed_description>
