	<brief_summary>This research study study target therapy possible treatment Smoldering Multiple Myeloma . The following intervention involve study : - Lenalidomide - Durvalumab - PVX-410</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study PVX-410 , Cancer Vaccine , Durvalumab +/- Lenalidomide Smoldering MM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . In research study , investigator study Smoldering Multiple Myeloma . Smoldering Multiple Myeloma early precursor rare blood cancer know Multiple Myeloma , affect plasma cell . The vaccine Combination Lenalidomide use hopefully provide immunity Myeloma . Durvalumab check point inhibitor combine augment immune activity vaccine . It monoclonal antibody know take brake immune system restore immunity . Lenalidomide previously study trial demonstrate increase immune activity . It hope investigator combination vaccine , Lenalidomide , Durvalumab augment immunity even . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve PVX-410 treatment disease.Durvalumab also approve treatment Multiple Myeloma . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Lenalidomide treatment option Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient confirm SMM accord definition derive International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) definition ( International Working Group , 2003 ) : serum Mprotein ≥3 g/dL BMPC &gt; 10 % , , along normal organ marrow function ( CRAB ) within 4 week baseline . C : Absence hypercalcemia , evidence calcium &lt; 10.5 mg/dL . R : Absence renal failure , evidence creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ( 177 µmol/L ) calculate creatinine clearance ( use Modification Diet Renal Disease [ MDRD ] formula ) &gt; 50 mL/min . A : Absence anemia , evidence hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL . B : Absence lytic bone lesion standard skeletal survey . Patient high average risk progression active MM , define 2 follow feature : Serum Mprotein ≥3 g/dL . BMPC &gt; 10 % . Abnormal serum FLC ratio ( 0.261.65 ) . Patient age 18 year old . Patient life expectancy great 6 month . Patient HLAA2+ ( Double Triple Combination Cohorts ) . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Patient adequate bone marrow function , evidence platelet count ≥75×109/L absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.0×109/L within 2 week baseline . Patient adequate hepatic function , evidence bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤2.5×ULN within 2 week baseline . If childbearing potential , patient agrees use adequate birth control measure study participation . If female childbearing potential , patient negative serum pregnancy test result within 2 week baseline lactating . If assign receive lenalidomide female reproductive potential , must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require Revlimid REMS® program . If assign receive lenalidomide , patient must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program willing able comply requirement REMS® program . Patient ( legally accept representative ) provide write informed consent participate study . Patient willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Patient symptomatic MM , define follow : Lytic lesion pathologic fracture . Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL ) . Hypercalcemia ( correct serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL ) . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) . Other : symptomatic hyperviscosity , amyloidosis . Patient history prior malignancy within past 3 year ( exclude resect basal cell carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer ) . Patient abnormal cardiac status , evidence follow : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) stage III IV congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Myocardial infarction within previous 6 month . Symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia require treatment persist despite treatment . Patient receive investigational agent . Patient current active infectious disease positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) . Patient history current autoimmune disease . Patient vaccinate live attenuate vaccine within 4 week study vaccination . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab . Had involvement plan and/or conduct study association Sponsor , study drug supplier ( ) study center previously enrol present study . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Frediricia 's Correction . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . History primary immunodeficiency . History allogeneic organ transplant . History hypersensitivity durvalumab excipient Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , active peptic ulcer disease gastritis , active bleeding diatheses , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability patient give write informed consent Known history previous clinical diagnosis tuberculosis .</criteria>
