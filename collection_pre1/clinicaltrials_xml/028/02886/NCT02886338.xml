	<brief_title>Study Feasibility Magnetic Navigated Capsule Endoscope Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Examination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction clinical practice 2000 , capsule endoscopy ( CE ) widely use noninvasive endoscopic examination gastrointestinal disorder . Compared traditional endoscopy , CE significant impact gastroenterology diagnose gastrointestinal ( GI ) diseases , largely owe follow three reason . First , wireless CE much comfortable patient . Second , much easy safe perform . Third , allow visualization anatomical region currently preclude traditional endoscopy . However , CE allow operator control navigation . The movement capsule passive , proceeds mean visceral peristalsis gravity . This make movement capsule purely random , portion gastrointestinal surface unable visualize . Moreover , gastrointestinal lesion identify , endoscopist maneuver capsule perform back forth , right leave movement detailed observation . All factor contribute limit diagnostic value CE examination . External controllability CE mean applied magnetic field possible solution maneuvering problem . However , effective system straightforward clinical applicability till . This ascribable lack reliable magnetic instrumentation suitable purpose . We report use magnetic field navigator effectively control locomotion CE . We demonstrate , vitro ex vivo , magnetic field navigator great potential practicability achieve high-precision rotation controllable movement CE . The aim study evaluate safety feasibility magnetic maneuvering capsule endoscope upper gastrointestinal tract , include esophagus , stomach duodenum healthy subject . The movement endoscopic capsule esophagus could drive external magnetic control device . The external magnetic control device could also adjust direction movement capsule stomach duodenum , might make examination whole upper gastrointestinal tract possible . The magnetic navigated CE would enable detailed investigation whole upper gastrointestinal tract , include esophagus , stomach duodenum . Using remote magnetic manipulation , capsule endoscope might improve diagnostic accuracy extend examination specific area interest gastrointestinal tract .</detailed_description>
