	<detailed_description>The goal study conduct randomize control trial use Botulinum toxin type A ( BTA ) prevent hypertrophic scar median sternotomy wound . The entire median sternotomy wound divide upper half lower half . Both half wind randomized receive treatment either BTA 0.9 % normal saline . The patient surgeon blind treatment arm . The primary end point evaluation upper low half scar use Vancouver Scar Scale ( VSS ) . At 6 month follow-up , two blind dermatologist examine patient take photographs scar outpatient clinic XiJing Hospital . Scars assess use VSS assign mean score two observer . At 6-month follow-up , ultrasonography measure scar width perform . At time , patient ask evaluate overall satisfaction , use four-point grade scale half scar ( 1= satisfy , 2= satisfied,3= slightly satisfy , 4= unsatisfied ) .Paired t-test used compare VSS score , scar width overall satisfaction BTA-treated group normal saline group .</detailed_description>
