	<brief_summary>Importance : Clinical communication important source medical error preventable adverse event . Objective : To determine effectiveness proficiency-based progression ( PBP ) simulation train ISBAR ( Identify , Situation , Background , Assessment , Recommendation ) communication deteriorate patient . Setting : The study conduct University College Cork , Ireland . Participants : Third year undergraduate nursing fifth year medical student , schedule undertake ISBAR training part National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) programme . Intervention : Participants prospectively randomize one three group undertake performance assessment ISBAR communication relevant deteriorate patient high fidelity simulation laboratory : HSE group ( national e-learning programme ) ; S group ( national e- learn plus simulation training ) PBP group ( national e-learning plus proficiency-based progression simulation ) . Main outcome measure : A proficiency benchmark performance ISBAR communication context acutely deteriorate patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first successful simulation validation study use proficiency-based progression methodology . Since approach successfully deploy produce superior technical skill yet validate non-technical ( communication ) skill . The ISBAR ( Identify , Situation , Background , Assessment Recommendation ) select standardised tool clinical communication relation acutely deteriorate patient many healthcare organisation worldwide , include Ireland . The aim study explore whether proficiency-based progression ( PBP ) could apply simulation-based training ISBAR performance produce superior skill set . The study compare performance outcomes student , receive national e-learning programme receive combination either standard simulation proficiency-based progression ( PBP ) simulation . Participants prospectively randomize one three training group within professional cohort ( medicine nursing ) undertaking performance assessment ISBAR communication relevant deteriorate patient high fidelity simulation laboratory : 1 . Online learning ( HSE ) -the national e-learning programme 2 . Standard simulation ( S ) -online learn plus simulation training 3 . Proficiency base progression ( PBP ) -online learn plus proficiency-based progression simulation . Main outcome measure : A proficiency benchmark performance ISBAR communication context acutely deteriorate patient . All participant require demonstrate certificate successful completion national e-learning programme within previous 4 week well supply baseline demographic information undertake training . Performance metric previously identify , operationally define agree upon modify Delphi panel meeting consist medical nursing expert series paper-based simulation case standardise high fidelity simulation case use assessment case . The proficiency benchmark case set base performance experience nursing medical personnel case series step , error critical error . Outcome assessment score review recording ISBAR performance participant standardise case high fidelity laboratory .</detailed_description>
