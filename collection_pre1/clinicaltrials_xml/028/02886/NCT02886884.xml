	<brief_title>Allogeneic Mesenchymal Human Stem Cells Infusion Therapy Endothelial DySfunctiOn Diabetic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixteen ( 16 ) diabetic subject endothelial dysfunction schedule undergo peripheral intravenous infusion meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion baseline . Three ( 3 ) subject treat 20 million ( 2 x 10^7 ) allogeneic hMSC 's thirteen ( 13 ) subject treat 100 million ( 100 x 10^6 ) allogeneic hMSC 's Follow : Subjects follow 3 , 7 , 14 28 day post-infusion complete safety efficacy assessments 6 12 month post-infusion complete safety assessment .</detailed_description>
