	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab In Central Nervous System Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . Pembrolizumab may help immune system fight cancer . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve pembrolizumab FDA disease treat study , central nervous system metastasis . Researchers hope study effect pembrolizumab . Many cancer use specific pathway ( PD-1/PD-L1 CTLA-4 ) evade body 's immune system . Pembrolizumab work block PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thus release brake immune system stop slow cancer . Researchers hope study effect pembrolizumab cancer metastasize brain . These drug work stimulate immune system fight cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm disease solid tumor Participants must measurable disease CNS , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ≥10 mm . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 6 week Participants must normal organ marrow function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant aCreatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Stable dose dexamethasone 2mg less 7 day prior initiation treatment Patients may progressive systemic disease Patients untreated spinal cord metastases eligible lesion asymptomatic Patients untreated brainstem metastasis eligible lesion small asymptomatic Cohort Specific Eligibility Criteria Cohort A : Measurable CNS disease ( one parenchymal lesion ≥1 cm ) Previously untreated asymptomatic brain metastasis Patients newly diagnose , previously untreated primary tumor present brain metastasis forego available therapy demonstrate definitive overall survival benefit firstline therapy metastatic disease ; therefore , case previously untreated systemic solid tumor patient available therapy definitive overall survival benefit , fail least one line prior therapy primary tumor , refuse standard therapy eligible study . Specifically , patient previously untreated primary tumor , follow diagnosis exclude : HER2positive breast cancer ; small cell lung cancer ; NSCLC targetable genomic tumor aberration ( e.g . EGFR , ALK ) . Cohort B : Measurable CNS disease ( one intracranial lesion ≥ 1 cm ) Progressive brain metastasis prior local CNS direct therapy radiation surgery define : Untreated measurable lesion patient receive surgery and/or SRS one lesions Residual progressive lesion surgery asymptomatic Patients prior WBRT and/or SRS whose lesion progress eligible . Lesions treat SRS may eligible unequivocal evidence progression Cohort C : Carcinomatous meningitis , define positive cytology Cohort D : Measurable CNS disease ( one parenchymal lesion ≥ 1 cm ) 14 brain metastasis ( stereotactic radiosurgery would indicate ) Histologically confirm diagnosis melanoma Participants chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy study therapy within 14 day protocol treatment , recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Participants receive investigational agent . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency . Requires treatment high dose systemic corticosteroid define dexamethasone &gt; 2mg/day bioequivalent within 7 day initiate therapy . Has receive systemic immunosuppressive treatment , aside systemic corticosteroid describe Section 3.2.4 , within three month start study drug Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction pembrolizumab . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Unable undergo brain MRI . Participants receive concurrent chemotherapy immunotherapies cancer ( except patient receive trastuzumab , bisphosphonates , denosumab ovarian suppression therapy Radiation therapy symptomatic single metastatic site brain may allow investigator 's discretion ) . Will need immediate local surgery radiation brain metastasis Acute symptomatic CNS hemorrhage</criteria>
