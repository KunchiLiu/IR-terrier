	<detailed_description>Since 1990s breast cancer incidence china increase twice fast global rate . Chinese patient responsible 12.2 % newly diagnose breast cancer 9.6 % deaths world breast cancer . Breast cancer second frequently diagnose cancer lead cause cancer-related death Chinese woman . Two prevalent breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1and BRCA2 . Howeverï¼Œbecause population base Genetic heterogeneity , frequency BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation high Caucasian population China . Anyway , mean age diagnosis breast cancer China almost 10 year young case diagnose 40 Caucasians . Therefore , believe certain specific susceptibility locus Chinese breast cancer . In preliminary experiment , investigator find two germline mutation may associate Chinese breast cancer . The purpose study determine frequency two germline mutation sanger-sequencing large sample Chinese breast cancer</detailed_description>
