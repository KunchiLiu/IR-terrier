	<brief_summary>Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( RALP ) widely perform due many advantage , include reduce need blood transfusion few surgical complication compare conventional open prostatectomy . As approach also recommend elderly patient serious comorbidities , optimal fluid therapy guidance procedure important . Dynamic variable pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) use predict guide fluid therapy control ventilation . These variable arise heart-lung interaction positive pressure ventilation , influence leave ventricular stroke volume ( SV ) . RALP require carbon dioxide insufflation steep Trendelenburg position optimise surgical condition , reduce cardiac output respiratory compliance . Accordingly , usefulness PPV SVV , affect change intrathoracic pressure , predict fluid responsiveness laparoscopic surgery condition may question . A recent study establish PPV SVV derive uncalibrated pulse contour analysis relatively poor capacity predict fluid responsiveness laparoscopy dynamic preload index . In contrast , another study SVV measure oesophageal Doppler monitor ( ODM ) could predict fluid responsiveness laparoscopic surgery . The CardioQ-ODM+ combine proven ODM Doppler measurement blood flow pulse contour analysis , quickly easily calibrate Doppler signal . We hypothesize PPV SVV measure calibrate pulse contour analysis would good indicator fluid responsiveness laparoscopy pneumoperitoneum . The primary objective study demonstrate PPV SVV measure calibrate pulse contour analysis CardioQ-ODM+ accurately predict fluid responsiveness RALP , involve pneumoperitoneum Trendelenburg position . Investigators also assess capacity dynamic variable ( SPV [ systolic pressure variation ] , SVV determine ODM Doppler flow , dynamic elastance [ PPV/SVV ] correct flow time [ FTc ] ) predict fluid responsiveness RALP .</brief_summary>
