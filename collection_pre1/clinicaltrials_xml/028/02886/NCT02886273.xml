	<detailed_description>Background : Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , also term sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) , account approximately 15 percent total mortality industrialize country , commonly result cardiac arrest due ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) . VF appear identifiable heart disease idiopathic arrhythmia . The commonly underlying heart disease associate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The proportion OHCA-patients CAD vary age . Autopsy study subject age 45 presumed diagnosis SCD reveal 10-15 percent without demonstrable cardiac abnormality ( 1-3 ) . A low value 5 percent obtain old patient include ( 4 ) . SCD initial presentation CAD 15 percent CAD-patients ( 5 ) . Furthermore also frequent mechanism death patient know CAD , account 40-50 percent CAD-mortality ( 6 ) . Compared healthy subject incidence SCD six- tenfold high presence clinically recognize heart disease , increase age two three time common men woman ( 7 ) . SCD due VF may appear initial presentation episode myocardial ischemia patient without know CAD . High-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) commonly use marker myocardial necrosis . Despite increased sensitivity cardiac troponins ( cTn ) early diagnostic stage introduction hs-cTNT assay , remain troponin-blind period early symptom onset . Cardiac pulmonary resuscitation may also lead slight elevation cardiac marker , include cTn ( 8 ) . This make difficult use hs-cTNT alone diagnosis acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) among patient OHCA . Copeptin , C-terminal moiety provasopressin , co-secreted vasopressin . Lately , circulate copeptin level demonstrate significantly elevate initial acute phase patient AMI ( 9 ) . Its concentration seem rise immediately symptom onset decrease rapidly thereafter . Copeptin may therefore improve early diagnosis AMI ( 10-13 ) help differentiate underlying cause SCD . When emergency care system provide early cardiopulmonary resuscitation defibrillation , approximately 50 percent out-of-hospital VF patient survive hospital admission 25 percent survive leave hospital ( 2 , 14 ) . These dramatic consequence make important identify risk factor also form rationale primary prevention . Most intervention date directly affect transient pathophysiologic event initialize potentially fatal arrhythmia . Instead , attempt alter prevent underlie disease like CAD . Animal study show fish oil protective ischemia-induced VF ( 15 ) . Support data come Physicians ` Health Study ( 16 ) , prospective study 20 551 men age 40 84 , free cardiovascular disease baseline , follow-up period 11 year . As compare consumption fish less month , fish intake least per week associate reduce risk SCD ( RR 0.48 ) . In study reduction risk total myocardial infarction , non-sudden cardiac death total cardiovascular mortality , protective effect fish suggest due reduction fatal ventricular arrhythmia . It hypothesize low risk SCD high fish intake may relate long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) EPA DHA find fish . Consistent hypothesis observation Physicians ` Health Study risk SCD significantly low subject blood n-3 FA level high compare low quartile . The potential effect fish oil protect SCD illustrate randomize , open-controlled GISSI-prevention study 11 324 patient recent myocardial infarction ( 17 ) . Patients receive n-3 FAs supplement significant low incidence combine endpoint death plus nonfatal infarction nonfatal stroke 42 month ( 12.6 versus 13.9 % ) . After adjustment risk factor , observed benefit due 20 % reduction risk death , mostly due reduction SCD . However , study 200 patient secure ICD ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) follow episode ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) VF , show reduction recurrence arrhythmias supplementation EPA/DHA . In study actually trend toward high incidence VT/VF patient randomize EPA/ DHA substitution ( 18 ) . In set underlying mechanism generation VF might , however , ischemic . The exact mechanism FAs might protect serious cardiac arrhythmia know . The investigator know important constituent cell membrane may affect several electrophysiologic property , rest potential , action potential , repolarization refractory period . Alterations cellular calcium concentration contribute significantly change impulse generation impulse conduction myocardial cell . Incorporation n-3 fatty acid cellular membrane show affect membrane fluidity turn may influence calcium entry removal . An alternative mechanism may change effect n-3 FAs myocardial production eicosanoids . In particular inhibition thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) production likely significant pathophysiological benefit , since TXA2 show implicated myocardial ischemia arrhythmogenesis ( 19 ) . Over last year vitamin D another dietary supplement find associate cardiovascular disease . This fat-soluble vitamin , primarily derive sun-exposure fatty fish , demonstrate influence cardiac contractility myocardial calcium homeostasis ( 20 ) , insufficiency vitamin may deleterious effect cardiac autonomic function evaluate heart rate turbulence heart rate variability ( 21 ) . In prospective study , severe vitamin D deficiency strongly associate total mortality , cardiovascular event SCD ( 22 - 26 ) . In one study 3299 Caucasian patient routinely refer coronary angiography , author could demonstrate hazard ratio death due heart failure SCD 2.84 ( 1.20-6.74 ) 5.05 ( 2.13-11.97 ) , respectively , compare patient severe vitamin D deficiency [ 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 25 nmol/liter ) ] person optimal range [ 25 ( OH ) D â‰¥ 75 nmol/liter ] ( 27 ) . Demonstrated effect electrophysiology , contractility , cardiac structure suggest vitamin D deficiency might actually causal factor development cardiac disease . The pronounced effect SCD find several study might indication possible protective effect high vitamin D-levels ventricular arrhythmia . This , however , well study optimal cut-off-value protection well define . A recent study William S. Harris et al ( 28 ) show level EPA/ DHA cell membrane red blood cell ( RBC EPA/ DHA ) highly correlate cardiac EPA/ DHA level . The RBC response supplementation also similar observe heart . Therefore RBC EPA+ DHA may serve useful surrogate cardiac omega-3 fatty acid status . The investigator expect n-3 FAs exert membrane stabilize effect ischemic episode , hypothesize patient suffer VF initial phase first AMI presentation low level RBC EPA/ DHA match control . As compare suggest pro-arrhythmic effect n-3 FAs ischemia , vitamin D deficiency may act differently respect . This support finding increase risk SCA patient low vitamin D level ; include establish cardiac disease ( 25 , 27 ) non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ( 21 ) , also otherwise healthy population ( 23 ) . Therefore , comparison 25-OH-vitamin D level different OHCA category patient , without acute coronary event , may appropriate . Aims study In study investigator intend give thorough description study population base demographic data , clinical information , medical history biochemical parameter . The investigator plan assess total number regional OHCA case among patient report ambulance service study period , determine proportion cardiac subject document VF . Next clinical baseline profile subject include study compare total cardiac VF population . Hs-cTNT BNP add baseline data classification include SCA patient . 1 . The main aim study evaluate diagnostic value copeptin set sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) . 2 . As second aim investigator intend evaluate association VF content EPA DHA red blood cell . 3 . Furthermore , vitamin D associate n-3 PUFAs diet , third aim ass association 25-hydroxy ( OH ) -vitamin D VF . 4 . Finally investigator intend analyse survival rate cardiac patient OHCA document ventricular fibrillation..
