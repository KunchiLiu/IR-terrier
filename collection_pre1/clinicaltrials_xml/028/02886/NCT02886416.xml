	<detailed_description>The importance still unmet challenge raise research eradication HIV reservoir need develop efficient vaccine HIV , impose much deep understand molecular mechanism regulate co-evolution co-adaptation HIV host natural course disease treatment . The unique cell collection establish 27 year ago ANRS cohort ( ImmunoCo ) new method ultra deep sequencing , `` next generation sequence '' , allow produce innovative analysis HIV variability reservoirs well repertoire use CD8 T cell responses provide new insight long term relationship virus host . The objective progress unprecedented level understand mechanisms thanks unique opportunity offer Immunoco cohort initially compose 152 patient infected HIV , untreated recruited 1991 97 Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital , 28 subject still follow hospital efficiently treat last 15 year . The ImmunoCo cohort initially set study characteristic cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses HIV disease progression . This exceptional still available 1991-97 cell collection enrich extra sample 1988 nowadays , allow u perform retrospective longitudinal analysis 27 year 28 patient still followed-up , new blood sampling 2016 . The project involve 5 highly experienced team aim characterize parallel : 1 ) viral evolution viral factor determine virulence , marker predict progression infection , perform ultra deep sequencing whole HIV genome viral variant archive blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , 2 ) evolution reservoir PBMC distribution variant archive reservoirs time , relationship exposure various selective pressure due CTL antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , 3 ) co-evolution anti-HIV CD8 T cell repertoire : hypothesis emergence new CD8 T clonotypes display great sensibility variant antigen , cross-reactivity able recognize similarly wild-type mutant epitope allow efficient long term control viral replication , cell loss clonal exhaustion associate disease progression . The coordinated study virus evolution , host response identification genetic determinant virulence allow good understand mechanism HIV pathogenicity persistence mutation viral reservoir , especially defective mutant resistant mutant ART , well co-adaptation CD8 T cell repertoires viral variability determine capacity viral control anti-HIV CD8 T cell . Altogether result open new strategy inhibit viral replication control viral reservoir therapeutic vaccinal perspective .</detailed_description>
