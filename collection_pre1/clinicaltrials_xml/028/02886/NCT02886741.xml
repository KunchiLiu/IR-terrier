	<brief_summary>In 2011 , IHI design new campaign accelerate uptake evidence-based practice show prevent surgical site infection ( SSI ) associate hip knee arthroplasty . Project JOINTS ( Joining Organizations IN Tackling SSIs multi-faceted , discipline initiative use Rapid Spread Network ( define ) , method tool develop previous IHI campaign influence orthopedic practice hospital perform hip knee arthroplasty . Rather launch nationally campaign do , Project JOINTS introduce cluster-randomized fashion enable rigorous , independent evaluation effectiveness promote uptake new evidence-based practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Ten-state Cluster-randomized Controlled Trial Institute Health Improvement 's Project JOINTS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Project JOINTS , evaluation team design state-level cluster randomize trial involve five pair state select matched characteristic describe . One state pair receive 6-month Project JOINTS campaign , state serve control . To measure change relevant evidence-based practice , RAND conduct survey orthopedic surgical staff ten state Project JOINTS . The project review approved RAND Institutional Review Board . Intervention : Project JOINTS build notion synergistic use evidence-based practices.14 IHI design encouraged implementation five-component `` enhance '' SSI prevention bundle include three relatively new evidence-based practice two well-established Surgical Care Improvement Program ( SCIP ) practice . The three evidence-based practice consistently implement hospital prior 2010 : 1 . Screen patient nasal Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) carriage decolonize SA carrier five day intranasal mupirocin CHG bathing ( minimum 3 consecutive day daily use ) day immediately precede surgery ; 2 . Instruct patient , regardless SA carriage , bathe shower chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) least three day surgery ; 3 . Use alcohol-containing antiseptic agent preoperative skin preparation . The campaign recruit state organization RSN develop 100,000 Lives 5 Million Lives Campaigns . The state organization reach hospital state invite participate campaign , disseminate information campaign evidence-based practice , assist IHI publicize activity describe prior publication . IHI develop logic model summarize campaign activity design achieve specify goal discuss refine collaboration evaluation team order inform evaluation measure . IHI develop intervention material ( include `` How-to Guide , '' evidence review , summary `` business case '' intervention prevent SSIs , tip sheet surgeon provider , patient family ) , create maintain project website email listserv , offer range learn opportunity ( include webinar call , faculty-led office hour , town hall meeting ) . Hospital practice staff participate Project JOINTS ( typically quality safety improvement leader staff oversight infection prevention ) receive access password-protected IHI website maintain IHI . In addition SSI prevention hip knee arthroplasty , Project JOINTs `` How To Guide '' also address important element `` Model Improvement , '' develop Associates Process Improvement later adapt IHI use campaign . These element include : ( 1 ) development QI plan ( include explicit aim measurement framework ) ; ( 2 ) small-scale test change- ( `` PDSA cycle '' ) refine implementation approach iterative learning ; ( 3 ) reliance multi-disciplinary implementation team . To enhance credibility clinician , IHI collaborate relevant professional organization , recruit faculty American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons ( AAOS ) American Association Hip Knee Surgeons ( AAHKS ) obtain endorsement AAHKS .</detailed_description>
