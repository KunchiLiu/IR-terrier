	<brief_title>Comparison Hepatectomy Local Ablation Resectable Synchronous Metachronous Colorectal Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) kill 700,000 patient every year , nowadays world 's 3rd common 4th deadly tumor . About 50 % CRC patient finally develop colorectal liver metastasis ( CRLM ) . Among CRLM patient , 20-25 % CRC find synchronous colorectal liver metastasis ( SCRLM ) first visit . Meanwhile , 20-30 % CRC patient suffer metachronous colorectal liver metastasis ( MCRLM ) even radical resection primary tumor . It nowadays admit R0 resection primary secondary tumor SCRLM R0 resection MCRLM represent feasible potential curative treatment patient resectable CRLM ( RCRLM ) . However , treatment strategy RCRLM ( tumor number≤3 tumor size≤3.0cm ) , whether choose hepatectomy local ablation , still remain debate . In primary hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , local ablation prove similar curative effect hepatectomy . Compared hepatectomy , local ablation less trauma rapid recovery possible low hospitalization cost . The curative effect local ablation mainly influence tumor site tumor size . On side , RCRLM might develop repeat recurrence even `` R0 '' resection due image undetectable micro metastasis . Thus , local ablation might suitable repeat recurrent CRLM . The aim study compare efficacy/safety local ablation hepatectomy RCRLM ( tumor number≤3 , tumor size≤3.0cm ) , include SCRLM MCRLM . Patients randomize CRLM resection group local ablation group . The primary endpoint overall survival . Secondary endpoint evaluate rate patient least one severe complication within 30 day surgery/ablation long-term clinical outcome , particular disease-free survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . At least one metastatic adenocarcinoma liver , histologically proven . 2 . At least one adenocarcinoma colon and/or rectum , histologically proven . 3 . No local complication time surgery ( occlusion , subocclusion , massive hemorrhage , abscesses local invasion ) . 4 . No extrahepatic metastasis . 5 . Extrahepatic disease ( EHD ) suitable hepatectomy , liver ablation anesthesia long sit EHD disease radically treat . 6 . All primary secondary tumor R0 resection technically possible .

Informed write consent . 1 . Other malignant tumor history . 2 . Complications need emergency surgery ( occlusion , subocclusion , massive hemorrhage abscess , et al. ) . 3 . Colorectal hepatic tumor extension towards abdominal wall and/or adjacent organ make liver R0 resection impossible immediately . 4 .
