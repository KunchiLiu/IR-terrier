	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether local anesthetic bupivacaine deliver intrathecally small dos via PTM self-administered bolus significantly improve breakthrough pain functional status patient chronic intractable pain manage intrathecal drug delivery system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Controlled Intrathecal Analgesia With Bupivacaine Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology /Technical Approach : Seventeen patient already use SynchroMed II pump contain admixture bupivacaine opioid use PTM dos receive Solution A first week study cross Solution B second week study . Solution A Solution B would consist either patient 's usual intrathecal opioid bupivacaine concentration usual patient 's intrathecal opioid concentration without bupivacaine . Only Investigational Pharmacy University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( UHCMC ) would aware content Solution A Solution B . Patients study personnel Pain Medicine Division would blind solution content . The sequence pump refill follow : - Week I : Patients intrathecal pump refill 10 milliliter Solution A B , removal residual volume baseline solution . - Week II : IT pump fill 10 ml Solution A B ( whichever solution subject receive Week 1 ) , removal residual volume Week I . Both patient evaluate physician blind . In order accomplish , central compounding ( investigational ) pharmacy UHCMC would make two solution label : A B respectively . Study subject randomize randomization order hold pharmacy supply medication . Patients keep solution one week . Data collect daily Primary outcome measure include 0-10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) immediately within 30 minute PTM bolus . Patients provide diary record pain score PTM bolus low pain score within half hour PTM bolus . Only 5 record per day day 3-7 10-14 available diaryâ€”thus patient would record pain score first 5 PTM bolus . Only score first 3 successful PTM bolus would consider . Successful PTM activation would determine review patient PTM diary internal log intrathecal drug delivery system . Each record PTM diary would time match successful PTM activation code internal log . This obviate potential mis-administered bolus whereby patient activate bolus device appropriately . Secondary outcome measure include average NRS pain score week , functional capacity evaluate Oswestry disability index ( ODI ) score , Global Impression Change painDETECT . Other relevant data number bolus use paresthetic sensation post bolus ( felt ) /patient guess blinding arm would record .</detailed_description>
