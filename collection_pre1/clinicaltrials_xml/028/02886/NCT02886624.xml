	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) 12 week 8-week oral treatment grazoprevir 100mg/elbasvir 50mg ( MRK-combo ) patient acute hepatitis C genotype1 4 co-infected HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Duration Therapy Acute Hepatitis C Genotypes 1 4 HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing rate acquisition HCV men sex men ( MSM ) , particular HIV-infected patient , report since 2001 Western European country particularly France . Observational study recently report HIV-infected gay bisexual men sexually transmit hepatitis C show unexpectedly rapid liver disease progression relatively short period time . It therefore admit , absence spontaneous HCV clearance within 3 month acute HCV infection , treatment initiate . Pegylated interferon combination weight-adapted ribavirin still recommend treatment choice HCV genotype acute setting . For patient develop rapid virologic response , treatment duration 24 week recommend . If antiviral therapy initiate within 24 week diagnosis , sustain virologic response rate 60 80 % observed price high side effect burden . However , short course therapy new direct acting antiviral likely safer efficient . But efficacy acute hepatitis C still establish . To date , US- Europe- base trial ongoing set association sofosbuvir ribavirine , sofosbuvir / ledipasvir sofosbuvir / simeprevir , duration 4 , 6 , 8 12 week . Preliminary result diverse , SVR12 range 56 % 95 % . MSD evaluate efficacy safety double drug combination ( grazoprevir + elbasvir ) HIV-infected patient exhibit paramount efficacy excellent tolerance diverse range genotype , include 1 4 HCV strain , mainly encounter French acute HCV epidemic MSM . This association potential use short treatment duration especially regard fact patient fibrosis time treatment initiation . This MRK-combo would therefore ideal candidate treat acute hep C due GT1 4 `` test treat '' approach high-risk population MSM .</detailed_description>
