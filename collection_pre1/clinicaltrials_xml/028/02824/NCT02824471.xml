	<brief_summary>'Sickle-shaped ' anemia first clinically describe US 1910 , mutate heritable sickle hemoglobin molecule identify 1949 . The pathophysiology SCD consequence abnormal polymerization sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) effect red cell membrane property , shape , density , subsequent critical change inflammatory cell endothelial cell function . Our goal understand impact CMA abnormalities SCD , interrogate number recognize interaction range clinical phenotype . To date , correlative study SCD , u others , range clinical report , base test , intervention , chart review individual group individual , extreme , identification functional gene polymorphism base population study . The investigator wish augment study systematic examination cellular membrane property activation status . Of hematologic disorder , SCD may unusually susceptible examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sickle Cell Disease Biofluid Chip Technology ( SCD BioChip )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel biofluidic chip technology investigate surface characteristic typically measure conventional technique , fluorescent activate cell sorting ( FACS ) , immunohistochemistry , microscopic image method . In FACS , cell interest isolate , extensively process , incubate fluorescent-labeled antibody sort optical recognition . In proposed SCD biofluidic chip ( SCD biochip ) , interrogate antibody coat microchannel surface capture cell population ( ) interest , without processing , incubation , vitro manipulation . The SCD biochip also quantitate cellular adherence experimental biological surface comprise subcellular component . The SCD biochip technically simple experimentally flexible , whereby population interest retain chip quantitated situ . The microchip system allow retrieval viable isolated cell potential downstream processing , analysis , vitro culture .</detailed_description>
