	<brief_summary>Purpose : To investigate feasibility new oxygen delivery device , `` Right Dose System '' ( RDS ) . It deliver individualized bolus oxygen rest exertion maintain acceptable oxygen saturation . The procedure include : Enrollment 10 patient , randomize either exercise oxygen prescription follow exercise RDS , exercise RDS follow exercise oxygen prescription . Randomization occur 1:1 basis . Each set exercise separate 30 minute recovery session . Subjects adults supplemental oxygen able exercise treadmill . Subjects 18 year age . Subject participation last approximately 1 month . Subjects recruit Loma Linda pulmonary clinic pulmonary rehabilitation program . Consent take place pulmonary clinic , pulmonary function lab pulmonary rehabilitation train study physician . If Multi-center : N/A ( single center ) If Single center investigator-initiated : 10 subject participate study .</brief_summary>

Consenting investigate physician license medical doctor state California instruct determine subject competent obtain consent . After question concern answer , patient sign date consent form . This process witness , sign date one clinic staff well investigator . This non-blinded study without placebo group . The investigator randomize subject assignment two cohort oppose intervention order . Subject confidentiality maintain staff . The LLUH Research Protections HIPPA form utilize inform gain consent subject . Data maintain lock department , lock office lock cabinet . All electronic data store LLUH network server . Study Design Background/Rationale Study : The trial design investigate efficacy safety novel personalize oxygen delivery device call `` Right Dose System '' ( RDS ) compare standard prescription oxygen , current oxygen delivery device exercise . As individual 's oxygen need vary accord level activity , RDS would provide individualized tailor pulse oxygen meet demand individual patient maintain appropriate oxygen saturation . Objectives : To compare RDS standard flow oxygen current prescription patient require supplemental oxygen rest exercise . This non-blinded , cross-over study 1:1 randomization either intervention A B , B A . It ascertain feasibility novel oxygen conservation device maintain oxygenation saturation exercise . The goal study establish proof concept device . Research Interventions : During exercise utilization right dose system ( RDS ) compare patient 's standard oxygen therapy . The study subject enrol test 2 different oxygen delivery device ( standard oxygen delivery device RDS SPO2 measurement ) . Visit 1 : Screening &amp; Evaluation Patients enrol clinic pulmonary rehabilitation . At time , screen , evaluation education study well consent demographic perform : 1 ) pulmonary clinic faculty medical office ( FMO ) , 2 ) Loma Linda University Medical Center pulmonary function test lab and/or 3 ) Loma Linda University Medical Center pulmonary rehabilitation office . Visit 2 : Two test evaluate O2 administration O2 prescription &amp; RDS active pulse oximetry separate 30 minute recovery period . Order intervention randomize 2 group : standard O2 therapy follow RDS , versus RDS follow standard O2 therapy . 1 . Measuring - exercise time , constant work rate endurance time , SPO2 , modify Borg scale perceive exertion shortness breath . 2 . The second end point much mean O2 delivered/minute ( patient may able exercise much longer RDS ) Investigational Device : - Name device : Right Dose System - Manufacturer : Smart Oxygen - Status Food &amp; Drug Administration , ID # : Pending Class 2 , 5-10K predicate meeting - Review animal study &amp; previous human study : None - Reported adverse effect : None , minimal risk device . Data Collection : Demographics : Including etiology hypoxemia , severity disease process , height , weight , age , gender , oxygen prescription , current oxygen delivery device . Resting blood pressure Pulse oximetry , , exercise ( use Masimo Radical 7 pulse oximeter , K120657 ) Comfort level walking , Perceived Exertion Level ( modify Borg scale ) Resting , exercise post-exercise Shortness Breath ( modify Borg scale ) Data Analysis The trial power demonstrate feasibility RDS maintaining target oxygen saturation hypoxemic patient exercise . Descriptive statistic calculate baseline variable ( demographic , objective , physical measure ) —this include mean , SD , range . Will evaluate difference oxygenation three different level activity ( rest , low exercise , moderate exercise ) utilize 2 different oxygen delivery system repeat measure analysis variance . Constant work rate exercise time compare two group via paired Student 's T-Test . Will statistician assistance providing : 2 variable t-test , ANOVA repeat measure . Benefits There immediate benefit subject .</detailed_description>
