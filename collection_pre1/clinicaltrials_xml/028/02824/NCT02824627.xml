	<brief_summary>Irritability emotional dysregulation recognize serious aspect psychopathology see pediatric psychiatric patient . While various behavioral well psychopharmacological intervention show efficacy improve irritability emotional dysregulation , data determine neurobiological mechanism effect neural level . Previous study demonstrate heighten amygdala response negative emotional stimulus closely related irritability emotional dysregulation child adolescent . Also , study show administration oxytocin decrease heighten amygdala response negative emotional stimulus across various psychiatric diagnosis . This study double-blind randomize trial oxytocin irritability emotional dysregulation pediatric population . Neuroimaging modality fMRI MEG employ probe neuro-circuitry change occur result oxytocin intervention , specifically include heighten amygdala response negative emotional stimulus dysfunctional fronto-amygdala connectivity . The investigator also investigate genetic sequence oxytocin receptor study participant relationship symptom profile neural activity change . Children adolescent ( age 10-18 ) diagnosis disruptive mood and/or behavior disorder ( include Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ ADHD ] , Oppositional Defiant Disorder [ ODD ] , Conduct Disorder [ CD ] , Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder [ DMDD ] ) , clinically significant level irritability emotional dysregulation measure Affective Reactivity Index Scale ( score &gt; /= 4 ) . 2 week randomize , double-blind treatment intranasal oxytocin ( 24 IU daily , 12 IU daily weight &lt; 40kg ) assessment diagnosis , symptom profile ( Affective Reactivity Index [ ARI ] , Inventory Callous-Unemotional Trait [ ICU ] , Behavior Assessment System Children , second version [ BASC-2 ] , Clinical Global Impression [ CGI ] ) pre- post-oxytocin treatment neuroimaging ( fMRI MEG ) . The genetic sample obtain via buccal mucosa sample .

	<detailed_description>1 . Clinical assessment Standard clinical practice outpatient clinic department psychiatry , University Nebraska Medical Center involve initial clinical interview either child adolescent psychiatrist faculty member , child adolescent psychiatry clinical fellow , advanced practice register nurse . The clinical interview include past current history psychiatric symptoms/signs , past current medical history , past/current social/academic history . Also current medication ( ) medical condition would interaction psychiatric diagnosis review . The child/adolescent receive diagnosis psychiatric syndrome end assessment session . 2 . Recruitment study Participants diagnose ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD presence clinically significant irritability emotional dysregulation clinical assessment session invite participate study afterwards . Participants respond advertisement , phone screening session also invite . 3 . Initial research assessment Participants agree enrol protocol initial research assessment session afterwards . This hold outpatient clinic department psychiatry , University Nebraska Medical Center . Participants receive Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia School-Age Children-Present Lifetime Version ( K-SADS ) , confirm diagnosis ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD , rule psychiatric diagnosis list exclusion criterion . Their IQ measure Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( 2-subtest form ) . Irritability emotional dysregulation measure Affective Reactivity Index ( ARI ) . Only child adolescent diagnose ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD clinically significant level irritability/emotional dysregulation ( score &gt; 4 ARI ) enrol study . CBCL , ICU , RPAQ use measure symptom profile functional impairment patient ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD initiation end point study participation . 4. fMRI visit 1 During MRI visit 1 , participant receive first fMRI session immediately initiation oxytocin placebo treatment . The fMRI visit 1 happen day initial research assessment initial research assessment complete . The Fearful Expression Processing task This shorten version paradigm previously utilize group ( Marsh &amp; Blair , 2008 ) . During trial participant ask decide gender face display . The face either demonstrate neutral affect morph intensity fear ( 50 % , 100 % 150 % ) . A trial involve : presentation face ( 1500 m ) fixation point ( 1000 m ) . There one run task , 120 face trial ( 30 neutral , 30 50 % fear , 30 100 % fear 30 150 % fear ) 60 fixation point trial . In addition , 15 second fixation point trial begin end run . Task duration 8 minute . The Affective Stroop task The affective task use adapt version paradigm describe previous work . During trail participant ask decide many number display screen , instead value number . For congruent trial , number display numerosity number value ( e.g. , three 3 ) . For incongruent trial , number display different numerosity number value ( e.g. , four 3 ) . The individual numerical stimulus consist three , four , five , six 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 randomly present within 9-point grid . There equal number congruent trial incongruent trial ( 48 run ) . These number picture precede follow emotional stimulus picture consist 48 positive , 48 negative , 48 neutral picture select International Affective Picture System . A trial involve : presentation emotional stimulus ( 400ms ) , numerical display ( 400ms ) , emotional stimulus ( 400ms ) , blank ( 1300ms ) . Subject complete two run , generate 288 picture-trial event ( 32 9 category ) 96 fixation point generate baseline . 5 . MEG visit 1 MEG visit 1 take place Center MEG ( South Doctors Tower , Ste . 222 ) day schedule study . The MEG visit 1 happen day initial research assessment . The Emotional Stroop task For emotional Stroop task ( EST ) , three word list prepare , threat list , negative list , neutral list . Each list contain 30 monosyllabic word . The threat word include thing encounter dangerous situation ( e.g . gun ) , negative word negative valence , relate threat ( e.g. , bad ) . The neutral word threaten negative ( e.g. , tune ) . The three word list equate across lexical feature include : length , frequency , orthographic , phonological neighborhood size . Using ELP database , word also equate average naming latency , name accuracy , lexical decision time , lexical decision accuracy ( Balota et al. , 2007 ) . The task contain 9 experimental block , consist 30 color word name trial one EST list . The order word within list randomize across presentation block . Within trial , participant first view fixation cross 1 second , replaced list item remain screen 2 second . An experimenter cod participant 's response correct ( i.e. , correct color identification ) , incorrect ( i.e. , name color , name wrong color , name word ) , noise trial ( e.g. , participant cough , etc. ) . The item center horizontally/vertically 43.5 35cm screen position eye-level approximately 110cm head . Items present red , blue , green font , item color randomly assign . Reaction time measure use dual-plane accelerometer attach low lip digitize 1kHz use Grass amplifier . Voice onset determine sharp increase amplitude accelerometer signal , produce response time accuracy near 1ms . 6 . Oxytocin/placebo administration If participant assign oxytocin treatment arm randomization , initiate oxytocin administration MRI visit 1 MEG visit 1 . Following previous study use intranasal oxytocin administration , subject weigh &gt; 40kg receive total 24 IU oxytocin deliver 2- 6 IU puff nostril daily . Subjects weigh &lt; 40kg receive total 12 IU oxytocin deliver 1- 6 IU puff nostril daily . Participants receive 14 21 day daily oxytocin/placebo administration . After 14 day oxytocin/placebo administration , participant schedule MRI visit 2 MEG visit 2 . After two visit complete , participant stop oxytocin/placebo administration . Participants assign placebo treatment branch receive identical bottle instruction delivery ingredient nasal spray except oxytocin . The instruction demonstration give parent legal guardian first administration nasal spray do clinic either child adolescent psychiatrist advance practice register nurse . The daily administration do dispatch either oxytocin placebo nasal spray parent participant . The oxytocin placebo nasal spray prepare University Nebraska Medical Center research pharmacist un-blinded subject 's treatment assignment . The randomization do department pharmacology computer-programmed randomization procedure . The participant 2 weekly visit clinic . They assess symptom level , nasal spray tolerance , assessment adverse effect . Participants initiate psychiatric treatment indicate change psychiatric condition ( worsen psychiatric symptom ) . In case , participate study . After 14 day -21 day trial completion 2nd scan MRI/MEG final research assessment , participant terminate participation study . 7 . MRI visit 2 MRI visit 2 identical participant MRI visit 1 occur least 14 day 21 day MRI visit 1 . The final research assessment session occur day MRI visit 2 . 8 . MEG visit 2 MEG visit 2 identical participant MEG visit 1 occur least 14 day 21 day MEG visit 1 . The final research assessment session occur day MRI visit 2 . 9 . Final research assessment Final research assessment session occur outpatient clinic department psychiatry University Nebraska Medical Center MRI visit 2 MEG visit 2 . During session , child adolescent psychiatrist advance practice register nurse investigator study administer follow-up assessment current symptom severity ARI , CBCL , ICU , RPAQ , well compliance treatment side effect . Participants discharge study follow final research assessment , request terminate study participation . If course study discover participant disorder condition would disqualify him/her ( e.g. , unexpected side effect oxytocin necessitate cessation treatment medical compromise make impossible continue oxytocin treatment ) , need evaluation , participant immediately referred clinical assessment intervention appropriate department University Nebraska Medical Center .</detailed_description>
