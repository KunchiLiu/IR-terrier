	<detailed_description>Migraine , one common neurological disorder U.S. , rank among top 20 cause disability worldwide . Migraine currently one lead cause disease burden woman age 15-44 year affect estimate 11 % adult population globally , strong female predominance . Current approach therapy primarily medication-based limited often-inadequate effectiveness , high cost many migraine-specific medication , common side effect . In addition , likely exist subtypes migraine may affect likelihood response treatment , poorly investigate to-date . Furthermore , many patient interested explore alternative pharmacological therapy functional disorder . Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , meditation-based intervention develop Kabat-Zinn University Massachusetts , increasingly show effective many patient variety functional disorder . Recent small pilot study suggest MBSR may also provide important benefit adjunctive therapy patient migraine headache . In preparation fully power randomize controlled clinical trial MBSR patient moderate-to-severe migraine headache , investigator propose detailed pilot/feasibility study develop test clinical research method require successful Phase III trial . The investigator first identify large number migraineurs Northern California-based Sutter Health system use analytic tool previously develop group . Next , use latent class analysis , investigator identify subgroup migraine patient defined comorbidities . The investigator enroll 60 patient pattern 4-14 headache per month randomize full 9-week MBSR intervention usual care usual care alone , follow-up 4 month . The primary clinical outcome change headache frequency 4 month , several secondary outcome , include assessment pain , quality life , functional status . As feasibility study , primary emphasis trial demonstrate investigator ' ability recruit retain participant , test whether propose enrollment criterion identify appropriate patient population , assess participant ' level adherence aspect protocol , determine optimal method data collection . The investigator compare two different smartphone-based application collect headache-diary information test logistics employ interim Bayesian monitoring . No test clinical effectiveness perform . The result feasibility study provide invaluable information study investigator development method ensure highly successful informative Phase III trial promise MBSR intervention common distress medical condition .</detailed_description>
