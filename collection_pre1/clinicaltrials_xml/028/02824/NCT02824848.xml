	<brief_summary>Congenital muscular torticollis ( CMT ) result tightness neck musculature cause infant tilt head one side turn side . Infants CMT also show unequal use side body movement play . In randomized clinical trial , researcher compare two physical therapy ( PT ) treatment method , passive stretch Perception-Action ( P-A ) Approach , effect head position use side body infant CMT . Behavior demonstrate PT session infant two group also compare . Thirty-six infant CMT randomly assign passive stretch group P-A Approach group . The infant group attend 5 weekly PT session , include initial evaluation , 3 subsequent weekly session , re-evaluation session . At visit 1 5 , infant 's habitual head position , ability turn head side , muscle strength side neck , motor development , use side body movement play assess . Each infant 's behavior exhibit therapy assess visit 2-4 . Results obtain two group compare . It hypothesize : 1 . There significant gain achieve intervention group initial final assessment follow outcome measure : 1 . Still photography 2 . Arthrodial goniometry use assess active head rotation side 3 . The Muscle Function Scale ( MFS ) use assess neck muscle strength 4 . The Alberta Infant Motor Scale ( AIMS ) use assess motor development 2 . There significant difference group list measure intervention complete . 3 . The P-A Approach group achieve great gain passive stretch group initial final assessment Functional Symmetry Observation Scale ( FSOS ) use ass use side body movement play 4 . The P-A Approach group demonstrate high Therapy Behavior Scale ( TBS ) score passive stretch group assign base participant ' behavior demonstrate PT intervention session</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perception-Action Approach v . Passive Stretching Infants With Congenital Muscular Torticollis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective longitudinal study two-group , single-blind , pre-post-test design randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) . The purpose study two-fold : 1 . To compare efficacy passive stretch Perception-Action ( P-A ) Approach intervention improve postural alignment , symmetrical use side body movement play , gross motor development infant congenital muscular torticollis ( CMT ) 2 . To compare therapy-related behavior infant CMT undergo passive stretch P-A Approach intervention physical therapy ( PT ) session Within group comparison make assess change time , group comparison make compare effect two intervention . Both intervention use clinic infant CMT known whether equally effective one effective . Thirty-six consecutively enrol infant CMT randomly assign Passive Stretching group P-A Approach group use block randomization procedure . Each infant attend 5 weekly 60-minute PT session , include initial evaluation , 3 intervention session , re-evaluation . The total duration participant 's involvement study approximately 1-2 month . At visit 1 5 , infant 's habitual head deviation midline , active head rotation side , neck muscle strength side , motor development , symmetrical use side body movement play assess . Participants ' photo take supine position part initial PT evaluation re-evaluation session video record future analysis assessor blind infant ' group assignment . Such analysis include still photography measurement , assessment motor development use Alberta Infant Motor Scale ( AIMS ) , assessment symmetrical use side body use Functional Symmetry Observation Scale ( FSOS ) . Treating therapist perform `` live '' active head rotation muscle strength measurement , assessor blind possible . In addition , infant 's behavior exhibit therapy assess treat therapist intervention session 2-4 . Results obtain two group compare . At first PT visit , treat therapist conduct PT evaluation , educate caregiver proper position benefit tummy time , provide intervention specific infant 's group assignment . For Passive Stretching Group , intervention include caregiver instruction passive stretch lateral flexion rotation neck , parent practice technique . For P-A Approach Group , intervention include interpretation infant 's behavior caregiver manual guidance provide infant . At 3 subsequent PT session , group-specific intervention continue caregiver instruction provide . Passive Stretching Group intervention component include passive stretching associate strengthening activity . P-A Approach Group intervention component include environmental set-up manual guidance . At final PT visit study , PT re-evaluation conduct , follow group-specific intervention need . Prior initiate RCT , pilot study conduct establish intrarater , test-retest inter-rater reliability outcome measure , appropriate . A total 10 infant CMT recruit pilot project . Fidelity intervention evaluate pilot study use Fidelity Intervention Checklist ensure treat therapist ' adherence strategy outline essential element intervention approach . In addition , main study , intervention adherence assess track participant ' attendance , PT session length frequency , total duration subject 's research participation .</detailed_description>
