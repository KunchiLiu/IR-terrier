	<brief_summary>Background : The increase effect environmental , occupational climate change pose serious global threat public health . More half world 's population , include around 85 % people Bangladesh , expose household air pollutant ( HAP ) . Environmental consequence climate change among high . Little evidence available effect HAP cardiopulmonary outcome low-income population . Same true occupational health climate change . The investigator evaluate effect HAP cardio-pulmonary marker immune function among non-smoking individual . The investigator also conduct two pilot study explore health effect associate work garment industry temperature due climate change . Hypothesis : 1 . Preclinical measure cardiovascular disease pulmonary function associate exposure level house hold air pollution ( HAP ) ( assessed PM2.5 , CO BC concentration ) 2 . Stable biomarkers immune function inflammation associate exposure level HAP . 3 . Use improved cook stove reduce exposure HAP thereby improve pre-clinical molecular measure cardio-pulmonary immune function . Methods : The investigator conduct cross sectional study assess association HAP preclinical maker CVD among 600 non-smoking participant age 25 65 year . Biomass exposure assess PM2.5 , carbon Monoxide ( CO ) black carbon ( BC ) collect personal air sample 24-hour . Blood sample utilize subset 200 adult participant 60 child age 3-5 year assess immune marker . The study conduct icddr , b URB study site Matlab Araihazar respectively . After cross sectional assessment , investigator conduct pre-post intervention study evaluate effectiveness improve stove subset 200 home . The investigator measure aforementioned marker two year cook stove installation . Finally , pilot study , health outcome due climate change ( temperature change ) occupation ( garment industry work ) explore . Outcome measure : HAP assess PM2.5 , CO BC concentration . Pulmonary function assess FEV1 , FVC FEV1/FVC . Preclinical maker CVD include RH-PAT , FMD , IMT , BAD , EKG PFT . Markers Immune function - proliferation macrophage , dendritic cell ( DC ) , neutrophils T-cell , well macrophage derive cytokine ( panel 17 27 cytokine ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC )</brief_summary>
