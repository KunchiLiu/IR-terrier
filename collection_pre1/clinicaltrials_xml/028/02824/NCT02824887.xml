Recent study show 10 % - 20 % lumbar disc herniation patient need surgical treatment , surgery patient , choice curative effect , quick effect side effect small , simple conservative treatment method become many lumbar intervertebral disc herniation urgent needs.Electroacupuncture deeply needle five lumbar acupoint therapy person charge project 20 year clinical experience put forward innovation specific therapy novel method treatment prognosis lumbar protrusion intervertebral disc carry innovative clinical research application , home abroad precedent . The project team small range clinical research literature research confirm efficacy electro acupuncture treatment lumbar disc herniation reliable , long-term efficacy acupuncture therapy carry . Therefore , combine cohort study conventional medical practice without human intervention , result study line actual advantage design prospective cohort study . Through long-term follow-up , large number clinical evidence electroacupuncture deep needling five lumbar acupoint therapy treatment lumbar disc herniation conventional western medicine conservative treatment compare difference efficacy , treatment , recurrence rate , explore long-term effect lumbar disc herniation recurrence factor kind therapy treatment lumbar disc herniation.This project involve deep needling lumbar five point long-term follow-up key content fit lumbar disc herniation rate high , recurrent episode characteristic course lingering , represent concern modern medical disease curative effect time pay attention development direction prognosis disease , good prospect clinical application . After 1 year , 175 patient visit follow formation research result , able EA deep needling lumbar five point therapy provide high quality clinical evidence , gradually form kind special treatment core characteristic traditional Chinese medicine treatment pattern , promote hospital clinical characteristic advantage party development . And order attract patient indication , amplification unit 's outpatient volume , achieve indirect economic benefit . From social point view , study explore draw clinical result research process patient rehabilitation guidance , direct benefit patient 's path choice , long-term efficacy prognosis disease lay good foundation , reduce disease recurrence help patient relieve pain , shorten course disease , save cost medical treatment . At time , large number clinical case subject group use establish database patient lumbar disc herniation , convenient retrospective study future . This study practice train train group high data acquisition doctor-patient communication skill master characteristic effective treatment method researcher , also become support project subject bear backbone sustainable development .</detailed_description>
