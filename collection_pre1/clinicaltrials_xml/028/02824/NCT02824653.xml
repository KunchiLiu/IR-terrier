	<detailed_description>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant become first choice treatment many malignant non malignant haematological disorder . Although great progress make prevent minimize transplant-associated complication , yet graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain significant complication affect outcome patient . It severe inflammatory condition arises recipient tissue attack immune mediate donor T cell transplantation . Acute GVHD predominately affect skin , upper low GI tract , liver occasionally eye oral mucosa , whereas chronic GVHD resembles autoimmune disorder clinical symptom . These symptom organ-specific generalize throughout body . The pathophysiology GVHD show different phase . In first phase i.e. , afferent phase , damage host tissue occur . In second phase i.e. , Induction expansion phase , donor T cell trigger activated recipient donor APC well inflammatory cytokine . Activated T cell produce IL-2 IFN-γ ( Th1 response ) . Allogeneic immune response amplify IL-2 , activate T cell natural killer cell response , trigger macrophage release TNF-α inflammation damage skin gut . The third phase i.e. , effector phase , characterize cytotoxic damage host cell activate donor T-cell-mediated Fas-Fas ligand interaction , perforin-granzyme TNF-α . The latter central role pathophysiology , stimulate cytokine production ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12 TNF-α ) . This dysregulation lead clinical manifestation acute GVHD . The cell involve GVHD pathophysiology include CD4+ T cell ; maintain expansion CD8+ T cell mediate GVHD , APCs ; role initiation phase acute GVHD describe murine model Natural killer ( NK ) cell ; contribute tissue damage effector phase release inflammatory cytokine nitric oxide . However , natural killer cell mediate cell death two important pathway : Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis perforin-granzyme-B-mediated cytolysis . HLA difference donor recipient major predictor GVHD . Other affect factor include age , gender mismatch donor recipient , minor histocomapatability antigen expression difference ( mHA ) otherwise identical HSCT , donor age , source dose stem cell ( PBSCT great risk BM ) , intensity conditioning GVHD prophylaxis . Steroids first line therapy acute GVHD patient standard treatment grade II-IV acute GVHD . Adverse effect glucocorticoid include hypertension hyperglycemia psychosis , immunosuppression , infection , myopathy , osteoporosis avascular necrosis bone , cataracts fat re-distribution etc . If acute GVHD improve 5-7 day treatment steroid consider steroid-refractory . Various agent investigate last two decade second line therapy include low-dose MTX , MMF , extracorporeal photopheresis , IL-2R targeting , antibody therapy CD3 , CD7 , CD25 , CD52 , CD147 , IL-2R , IL-1 , TNF-α ( i.e. , basiliximab , daclizumab , denileukin , diftitox alemtuzumab ) , horse ATG , etanercept , infliximab , sirolimus recently infusion mesenchymal stem cell . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) define self-renewing , multipotent progenitor cell potential differentiate cell type mesodermal origin , adipocytes , osteocyte , chondrocytes . Mesenchymal Tissue Stem Cell Committee International Society Cellular Therapy develop minimal criterion definition MSCs follow : first , adherence plastic ; Second , positivity cell-surface molecule CD105 , CD73 , CD90 negativity CD45 , CD34 , CD14 CD11b , CD79a CD19 , human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -DR ; third , ability differentiate osteoblast , adipocytes , chondroblasts standard vitro differentiation condition . Since Le Blanc colleague first report successful treatment patient severe acute GVHD use third-party haploidentical MSCs 2004 , many clinical trial worldwide describe benefit MSC therapy GVHD . The propose project phase I/II clinical trial single group , open label , interventional study design . The objective observe safety efficacy intravenous injection ex-vivo expand bone marrow mesenchymal cell third party donor treat refractory GVHD . The study also document type frequency adverse event side effect , discover .</detailed_description>
