	<brief_summary>The investigator look presence fusion gene patient operate glioma . This search limit glioma show IDH1 mutation , latter seek routine anomaly never co-existing . The hypothesis rate progression-free survival grade IV glioma III without IDH1 mutation , usual chemotherapy , 15 % 6 month ( ie , 85 % patient relapse 6 month treatment ) , must new treatment 35 % ( primary endpoint ) . The main objective evaluation disease-free survival 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With AZD4547 Recurrent Malignant Glioma Expressing FGFR-TACC Gene Fusion ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3 % GBM IDHwt gliomas highly oncogenic FGFR-TACC gene fusion confers high sensitivity FGFR inhibitor tumor cell , vitro vivo . Preclinical data show expression FGFR-TACC fusion confers sensitivity FGFR inhibitor ( include AZD4547 ) GBM models.AZD4547 ( AstraZeneca ) potent selective inhibitor FGFR-1 , 2 3 receptor tyrosine kinase . Preclinical data show CNS penetration . Some important adverse event hyperphosphatemia , ocular complication . The primary objective assessment criterion ass efficacy AZD4547 measure rate Progression Free Survival 6 month ( PFS6 ) recurrent malignant glioma patient FGFR-TACC fusion.Secondary objective assessment criterion : - To characterize safety , tolerability PK AZD4547 glioma patient - To assess anti-tumor activity AZD4547 patient recurrent glioma FGFR-TACC fusion base Overall Response Rate patient measurable residue . - To assess anti-tumor activity AZD4547 patient recurrent glioma FGFR-TACC fusion base duration PFS - To assess anti-tumor activity AZD4547 patient recurrent glioma FGFR-TACC fusion base Overall Survival AZD4547 Exploratory objectives - To elucidate mechanism response resistance ( primary secondary ) exploratory biomarker analysis Experimental design : This phase II study patient diagnose FGFR3-TACC3 FGFR1-TACC1 fusion positive glioma present recurrence disease chemotherapy radiotherapy . RNA systematically screen presence FGFR-TACC 11 participate center , IHC FGFR3 hyperexpression . The investigator also encourage wide use FGFR3 IHC non participate center order identify additional potential candidate refer one 11 center assessment FGFR-TACC expression RNA analysis.. Patients receive AZD4547 dose 80mg bd continuous schedule , disease progression . With follow hypothesis : P0 : PFS6=15 % , P1 : PFS6=35 % , alpha=5 % power=80 % , initial cohort 12 patient treat . If objective anti-tumor effect observe , cohort expand include total number 38 subject . Grade II glioma also eligible constitute extra small cohort .</detailed_description>
