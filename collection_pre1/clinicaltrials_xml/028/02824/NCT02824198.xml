	<brief_summary>The aim study ass describe booster effect CYD dengue vaccine dose administer 5 year completion 3-dose vaccination schedule . Primary Objective : - To demonstrate non-inferiority term geometric mean titer ratio ( GTMR ) CYD dengue vaccine booster compare third CYD dengue vaccine injection subject CYD 28 trial ( subject Group 1 ) . Secondary Objectives : - If primary objective non-inferiority achieve : To demonstrate superiority , term GMTRs , CYD dengue vaccine booster compare third CYD dengue vaccine injection subject CYD28 trial ( subject Group 1 ) . - To describe immune response elicit CYD dengue vaccine booster placebo injection subject receive three dos CYD dengue vaccine CYD28 trial subject . - To describe neutralize Abs level dengue serotype post-dose 3 ( CYD28 subject ) immediately prior booster placebo injection subject . - To describe neutralize Ab persistence 6 month , 1 year 2 year post booster placebo injection study subject . - To evaluate safety booster vaccination CYD dengue vaccine study subject .</brief_summary>
