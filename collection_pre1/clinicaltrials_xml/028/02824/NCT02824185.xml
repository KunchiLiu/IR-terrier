	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common cancer term incidence second term mortality . At early stage , base low number size liver nodule absence extra-hepatic location ( Milan criterion ) , curative treatment perform , i.e . liver transplantation , surgical resection , thermo-ablation . These treatment lead severe complication , patient benefit must carefully select . The correct identification HCC lesion time therapeutic decision crucial . MRI reference examination diagnosis field exploration limit upper abdominal area sensitivity decrease nodule less two centimetre . Such lesion could actually HCC cause early post-operative progression . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ; functional imaging ) fluorodeoxyglucose provide prognostic information impact initial stag less 5 % case . However , PET fluorocholine ( FCH ) , available France since 2010 , could detect intra- extra-hepatic HCC lesion identify conventional imaging , potentially impact patient management ( e.g . 52 % patient small case study ) . FCH-PET/MRI could therefore ideal examination initial stag HCC , combine single multimodality investigation reference morphological imaging technique efficient functional one . The hypothesis study FCH-PET/MRI able detect , patient eligible curative treatment , additional preoperative intra- extra-hepatic early metastatic HCC unseen equivocal conventional imaging ( CT MRI ) responsible recurrence disease progression 6 month .</brief_summary>
