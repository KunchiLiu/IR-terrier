	<brief_title>A Guided Written Disclosure Intervention Promote Post-traumatic Growth Cancer Patients GUIDED WRITTEN DISCLOSURE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study aim The primary aim study assess efficacy Guided Written Disclosure Protocol promote post-traumatic growth stage I-III breast colon cancer patient end adjuvant chemotherapy . The secondary aim study include - Evaluating efficacy GWDP term intrusive thought avoidance reduction - Assessing efficacy GWDP term reduction depression anxiety - Investigating relationship construct mean post-traumatic growth . Methods Study design The study randomize control trial . Eligible patient give consent participate study randomize receive GWDP intervention ( experimental group ) control intervention ( control group ) . Participants Participants recruit Oncological Day Hospitals ( DH ) Scientific Research Care Institute ( IRCCS ) Santa Maria Nuova Hospital Reggio Emilia - Oncology Unit Eligibility criterion assess review patient ' medical record verify time recruitment . Randomization Eligible patient , agree participate study , randomly assign GWDP condition control condition allocation ratio 1:1 , stratify oncological DH . Randomization carry central phone randomization center use computer generate random number . After registration patient basic information , trial center attribute unique code include patient , communicate professional allocate condition . This code report form related patient . The intervention The experimental intervention ( GWDP ) consist three 20-minutes write session instruction provide patient experienced traumatic event cancer diagnosis therapy . Initially , participant invite recall chronologically facts concern traumatic event , label emotion related fact , appraise immediate change priority , reflect current feeling , cop mechanism learn . Moreover , ask reflect experience cancer change view life , teach cope difficulty may arise future . Below , investigator report synthesis task concern three write session . Participants ask : 1. describe memory concern cancer illness chronological order , objective detach attitude . 2. describe : ( ) thought emotion perceive illness experience ; ( b ) impact illness daily life , change attitude toward life . 3. focus actual situation , think entire illness experience , report follow aspect : - present thought feeling , differ one felt illness experience . - extent come term , understand appreciate dealt successfully illness . - learn illness term personal insight , knowledge skill , resource could useful future . - cope similar event future . Participants ask find quiet place time home write without disturbed . The first writing session perform two week initial assessment ( T0 ) , follow two session every two week . Original instruction translate Italian , adapt specific traumatic experience cancer diagnosis treatment . The control condition consist three 20-minutes write session participant request write event daily routine happen past week ; also ask focus fact , objective detach attitude . An active control intervention use account general ( i.e. , due write general description ) specific effect ( i.e. , due write emotional expression , together cognitive reframing ) write task . As experimental group , participant ask find quiet place time write without disturbed . It use time interval session GWDP . One day write session , patient condition contact telephone researcher , check understanding instruction include booklet , remind perform write task . Failure contact patient record patient form . Procedures recruitment assessment Recruitment baseline assessment ( T0 ) . One health care professional ( oncologist , nurse psychologist ) participate recruiter evaluator . They train Steering Committee study aim procedure , provide study material . The preferred method recruitment involve oncologist inform eligible patient , attend DH medical consultation . In case impediment recruitment ( e.g. , oncologist ' lack motivation involvement study , medical consultation schedule beyond eight month end chemotherapy , patient ' unavailability time medical appointment ) , letter send eligible patient present general information study . Three seven day later , member study staff call patient phone give information , verify his/her availability participate . Patients interested intervention meet health care professional , explain study aim write task , provide information sheet , collect socio-demographic data health information ( i.e. , age , sex , educational level , marital status , time since diagnosis , disease site stage , treatment receive ) . Patients , agree participate , give write consent . The health care professional administrate baseline questionnaire , contact trial center randomization . Finally , booklet concern intervention , accord allocation group , provide participant . Anonymity guarantee write texts outcome assessment . Post-intervention follow- assessment ( T1 T2 ) . Participants re-assessed study outcome three month baseline ( T1 ) , time tolerance ± 15 day , whenever possible medical consultation . In occasion , booklet contain patient 's write text return . Follow-up evaluation ( T2 ) perform six month post-intervention assessment ( time tolerance ± 15 day ) , whenever possible medical consultation . Hypotheses Main hypothesis . Investigators expect , intervention , participant GWDP group high score Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory compare control group . Meaning construction deem mechanism underlie restructure adaptive schemas lead growth . Therefore , investigator expect increase level PTG could moderate constructed meaning , measure Constructed Meaning Scale . Secondary hypothesis . Investigators hypothesize , intervention , participant GWDP group lower score Impact Events Scale compare control group . Investigators also predict participant GWDP group lower score Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale compare control group . Sample size A prospective power analysis reveal current study would require 250 participant achieve 80 % power . The predicted effect size ( Hedges 's g = 0.36 ) estimate accord recent meta-analysis effect psychological intervention post-traumatic growth . Data analysis A preliminary analysis perform compare , baseline , difference clinical demographic data two group ( GDWP intervention vs. control intervention ) . After , 2 X 3 mixed factorial design ANOVA perform dependent variable ( Post-traumatic growth , distress measure ) . The `` '' factor intervention two level ( yes/no ) `` within '' factor time three level ( T0/T1/T2 ) . Adjusted analysis variance sociodemographic health variable covariant perform . Finally , potential moderating role construct mean effect GWDP accord MacArthur approach . Ethical issue The data collection intervention perform accordance ethical standard local Ethical committee , approve protocol .</detailed_description>
