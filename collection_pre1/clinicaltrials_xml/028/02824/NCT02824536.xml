	<detailed_description>The study conduct placebo-controlled , double blind , randomize allocation study product . Study participant study group randomize receive intravenous infusion 3BNC117 10-1074 placebo . 3BNC117 10-1074 administer 2 dose level ( 3 mg/kg 10 mg/kg ) . These dos select base plan development subcutaneous formulation prophylactic use product . The study consist 3 group . Enrollment Group 1 begin first participant enrol least one day apart . Eight participant enrol group ; 6 randomize receive study drug 2 randomize receive placebo . Participants Group 1 receive single infusion antibody 10mg/kg Week 0 . Enrollment Group 2 begin Day 28 safety data participant Group 1 , include ophthalmologic exam , available . Enrollment Group 3 begin Day 28 safety data participant Group 2 available . If &gt; 1 grade 3 high adverse event deem probably definitely relate study drug occur single group , next group enrol pending safety monitoring committee ( SMC ) review . Participants Groups 2 3 receive 3 infusion antibody Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 , dose either 3mg/kg 10mg/kg . The antibody administer sequentially via intravenous infusion . Each antibody administer 60 minute . Following product infusion , study participant return safety assessment multiple time point . Blood sample collect safety test week 1 , 2 , 4 follow infusion , multiple time point end study follow . Baseline pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment perform start first infusion . Peak PK sample 3BNC117 occur follow completion 3BNC117 infusion prior start 10-1074 infusion . Peak PK sample 10-1074 occur follow completion 10-1074 infusion . Additional PK assessment occur multiple time point study follow . Study participant follow total 24 week follow final antibody infusion .</detailed_description>
