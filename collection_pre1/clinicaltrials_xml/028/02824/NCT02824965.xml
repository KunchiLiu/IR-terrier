	<detailed_description>Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis ( 1 ) Objective : To evaluate safety intravenous CVA21 combination pembrolizumab patient advance NSCLC . Hypothesis : Pembrolizumab combination intravenous CVA21 well tolerate patient advanced NSCLC . Secondary Objective &amp; Hypothesis ( 1 ) Objective : . To evaluate efficacy intravenous CVA21 induce immune cell rich tumour microenvironment patient baseline biopsy demonstrate tumour immune cell poor microenvironment . ii . To evaluate efficacy intravenous CVA21 combination pembrolizumab patient advance NSCLC use irRECIST . iii . To evaluate safety intravenous CVA21 combination pembrolizumab . iv . To identify safe potentially effective dose intravenous CVA21 combination intravenous pembrolizumab . v. To serially evaluate presence detectable virus anti-viral antibody peripheral blood trial participant . Hypothesis : i. CVA21 induce immune cell infiltration tumor patient lack immune cell rich micro-environment .</detailed_description>
