	<detailed_description>Recently , European medicine agency approve ibrutinib idelalisib treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) two lymphoma : Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) ibrutinib Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) idelalisib . Nevertheless , clinical trial two drug perform 300-350 patient show several side effect profile , frequent diarrhea , infection , cutaneous rash… For patient , treatment reduce stop temporary definitely . Pharmacokinetic property two drug highlight interindividual pharmacokinetic considerable variability . The aim clinical research study determine association clinically significant side effect occurrence first year treatment ( serious adverse reaction and/or grade CTCAE ≥ 3 and/or leading dosage concession ) plasma mean concentration steady state ibrutinib idelalisib perform 1 month . To determine plasma mean concentration steady state ibrutinib idelalisib , blood test perform every scheduled monitoring visit 1 month pharmacokinetic exploration schedule medical consultation ( 2 , 3 , 6 12 month ) every unscheduled visit case side effect occurrence . Every schedule monitor visit , blood test perform determine plasma concentration drug . Complementary blood salivary sample collect treatment , 24 month later case relapse determine genetic characteristic . In parallel , logbook complete patient collect side effect . Finally , oncology certify nurse call patient every 2 week . In case side effect occurrence visit organize next 3 day blood test perform .</detailed_description>
