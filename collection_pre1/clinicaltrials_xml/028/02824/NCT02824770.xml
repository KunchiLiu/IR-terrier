	<brief_summary>Endogenous melatonin produce pineal gland night normal condition regulate sleep-wake cycle . Artificial light administer night suppresses melatonin production sleep disturbance accompany abnormal melatonin secretion phase delay . Therefore , dramatic disturbance endogenous rhythm intensive care unit patient remarkable effect melatonin production . In addition physiological role regulate sleep pattern , melatonin demonstrate provide antiinflammatory effect experimental model . Although previous study investigate circadian pattern melatonin intensive care unit patient , investigator think present study first one ass effect control noise light melatonin inflammatory response major abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
