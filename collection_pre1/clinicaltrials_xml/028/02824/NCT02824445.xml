	<brief_summary>After 13 year war , PTSD become pervasive service member . Traditionally evaluated PTSD Checklist Military Version ( PCL-M ) treat cognitive processing therapy , prolonged exposure therapy medication management limited success . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) show efficacy improve individual cognitive function past decade , healthy population patient depression . TMS approve FDA treatment major depressive disorder migraine headache . Magnetic EEG guide Resonant Treatment ( MeRT ) form individualize TMS base member 's EEG/ECG input . Investigators propose use MeRT treat veteran war-related PTSD , syndrome include depressive anxious symptom ; likely MeRT ( namely TMS ) beneficial comparable well current FDA approve method treat PTSD .</brief_summary>
