	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor efficacy single agent ibrutinib measure overall response rate patient relapsed/refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma relapse responded chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess duration tumor control include duration response ( DOR ) II . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . To assess safety tolerability 560mg ibrutinib Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess mechanism ( ) ibrutinib may active patient classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL ) correlation potential biomarkers clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 9 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
