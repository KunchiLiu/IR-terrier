	<brief_title>Long-term Outcome Late-onset Pompe Disease Treated Beyond 36 Months ( ATBIG-Pompe-Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presentation course late-onset Pompe disease much less foreseeable classic infantile form . Some patient experience rapid worsen skeletal muscle function lead loss ambulation respiratory failure , others progress less rapidly . So inconstant response treatment skeletal muscle lung function long-term . Therefore , unmet clinical need collection analysis long-term data rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) late-onset Pompe disease patient age 8 year old . The principal goal investigator driven study gain conclusive insight long-term outcome data beyond 36 month 10 year ERT treatment . In addition collect biological sample patient future biomarker study include gene modifier search genome RNA seq ( part proposal ) . This study may provide clinician researcher well understand late-onset Pompe disease long-term treatment , benefit patient affect late-onset Pompe disease , well , individual family relate disease .</detailed_description>
