	<brief_title>Study Evaluate D2 Receptor Occupancy Following Single Intravenous Administration ATI-9242</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve evaluate occupancy ATI-9242 steady state three different dose level D2 receptor brain use [ 18F ] Fallypride PET three cohort subject . The first dose evaluate 0.5 mg/kg administer IV bolus injection . The second dose evaluate 1.0 mg/kg IV bolus injection . The safety occupancy dose level evaluate prior move next dose . On two separate day , subject undergo [ 18F ] Fallypride PET image session . The plasma concentration ATI-9242 obtain prior course image session allow determination relationship plasma concentration ATI-9242 vivo D2 occupancy .</detailed_description>
