	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial evaluate effectiveness supplemental photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) optimize removal bacteria endotoxins primarily infect root canal one-visit two-visit treatments.Twenty-four primarily infect root canal apical periodontitis select randomly divide one-visit ( n=12 ) two-visit treatment ( n=12 ) . Chemo-mechanical preparation ( CMP ) perform use single-file reciprocating technique + 2.5 % NaOCL final rinse 17 % Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . The photosensitizer agent ( methylene blue 10 mg/mL ) apply root canal 60 second submit laser potency 60 milliwatt ( mW ) energy density 129 J/cm2 120 second CMP one-visit treatment 14-day inter-appointment medication Ca ( OH ) 2 + saline solution ( SSL ) two-visit treatment . Samples collect root canal procedure . Endotoxins quantify chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate assay . Culture technique use determine bacterial colony-forming unit count .</brief_summary>
