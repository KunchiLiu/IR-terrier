	<brief_summary>People inject drug ( PWID ) high rate hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) group . Effective , safe new treatment call direct-acting antiviral agent ( DAAs ) develop recently . Unfortunately , PWID rarely get treatment . The drug expensive , insurer often cover cost DAAs . Sometimes provider hesitate prescribe DAAs concern PWID wo n't take medication patient might become reinfected . Several good model treat PWID exist . One provide directly observe treatment ( DOT ) . Another model provide treatment PWID support patient navigator ( PN ) , public health worker offer support education patient . Though DOT PN model successful , still n't know model work best . In study , investigator study DOT PN model treat HCV PWID . The investigator ' goal find model produce best result prefer patient . Up 1,000 HCV-infected PWID participate study eight site around country . Patients randomize either PN DOT group . Patients end PN group get biweekly blister pack medication take home . Their PN provide education support . The investigator find whether patient adhered medication use electronic adherence monitoring system . Patients randomly assign DOT group take medication front staff member .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-site national study ( 8 U.S. city ) , 1000 HCV-infected PWIDs ( inject illicit substance within last 3 month ) randomize either PN plus biweekly blister pack dispensation versus mDOT . Among patient go initiate HCV treatment ( n=600 target ) once-daily combination regimen , comparison conduct proportion patient arm : ( ) optimally adhere ( &gt; =80 % ) , ( b ) complete treatment , ( c ) achieve SVR , ( ) develop resistance . The primary outcome SVR . The 8 site offer geographic policy diversity : New York City , Baltimore , Providence , Boston , Morgantown , Seattle , San Francisco , Albuquerque . Participants recruit diverse venue : OAT clinic , community health center , syringe exchange program , community-based organization , homeless program , cohort establish research study . The clinical site determine eligibility base clinical record , on-site test include HCV test ( anti-HCV HCV viremia ) drug toxicology test need . Study participant screen , consent enrolled on-site OAT non-OAT clinic setting . Patients randomize one two model care : patient navigation ( PN ) vs. modify directly observe treatment ( mDOT ) . Patients enrol OAT clinic receive methadone randomize mDOT receive dos daily medication time receive methadone . Patients enrol community health setting randomize mDOT may receive observed dos range setting include : clinic , home , community site ( e.g . coffee shop gather place ) , use mobile health app smartphone . Subjects randomize PN receive standardize PN intervention additional support peer-led support group . Participants follow 140 week : 12 week pre-treatment evaluation , 12 week treatment , 12 week follow-up determine SVR12 , 104 week follow-up determine long-term SVR reinfection . Data source include clinical lab image result medical record , blood test ( HCV viral load long-term follow-up resistance assay ) , urine toxicology , questionnaire , electronic monitor assess adherence , interview .</detailed_description>
