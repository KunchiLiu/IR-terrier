	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Investigating Effect Chemotherapy Tumoral Immunoprofile Gynecologic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-institution , non-interventional prospective observational study allow specimen data collection . All participant receive standard care surgery chemotherapy , determine gynecologic oncologist per institutional protocol . Patients presumed diagnosis eligible gynecologic malignancy ( epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal , uterine endometrial cancer ) consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior confirmatory biopsy give option enroll study . Patients undergo standard biopsy endometrial curettage confirm diagnosis . Additional tumor tissue research purpose collect time biopsy ( safely available ) . Patients undergoing diagnostic therapeutic paracentesis option consent allow excess ascites evaluate research protocol . Additionally , research blood sample collect day biopsy/curettage . After confirmation diagnosis , chemotherapy administration proceed per standard institutional protocol surgical planning perform treat gynecologic oncologist . Excess tumor tissue ascites cytoreductive surgery collect immune profiling . An additional vial blood research collect within 3 day prior surgery . Post-surgical treatment chemotherapy proceed per standard procedure . After completion post-surgical adjuvant therapy , additional vial blood research collect ( next schedule clinic visit ) .</detailed_description>
