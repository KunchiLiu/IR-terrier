	<brief_title>Preoperative Significant Clinical Findings Using Focused Ultrasound Examination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergent orthopedic urological surgery elderly population characterize high incidence chronic disease target population one hand , time factor limit possibility properly assess preoperative condition hand . Therefore , anesthesiologist often perform procedure hip replacement insufficient data compare elective case . In Israel , hip fracture must operate within 18 hour . This type fracture common elderly population naturally suffer chronic disease might influence management anesthesia . Due emergent nature procedure involve , patient often operate basic preoperative assessment ECG , chest x-ray blood test . A elaborated assessment , valid echocardiography , evaluation pleural effusion presence ascites often impossible acquire due inaccessibility echo lab ( high burden , miss qualified personal ) availability operation theater . This observational pilot study ability focus , bedside preoperative ultrasound examination preform qualified anesthesiologist expose significant clinical data evaluate . Sample size : 30 patient . Male female age 65 . The examination cover heart ( eg . volemic status , global systolic function , existence severe valvular pathology , pericardial effusion ) , lung ( eg . pleural effusion , atelectasis , pneumothorax ) abdomen ( e.g ascites ) . It preform patient bed use VIVID5S General Electric device . All field examine use low frequency cardiac probe . The data document save electronically main investigator . All record ultrasound examination save coded number ( patient detail ) . All data collect validated physician experience field . Any mismatch anesthesiologist record validate data document . Clinically significant finding document transfer ( validation ) anesthesiologist perform anesthesia ( senior anesthesiologist ) . On follow day , anesthesiologist document : 1 . Any change anesthetic management due examination finding 2 . Subjective report regard utility examination Anesthetic change subjective report graphically document . The anesthesiologist preform examination underwent necessary qualification preform exam . In case , preoperative examination operation hold anesthesiologist . Patient enrollment study preform ward , E.R preoperative hall . It must emphasize case performance operation detain examination .</detailed_description>
