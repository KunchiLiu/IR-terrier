	<brief_title>Study Assessing Evaluation Interest Serum S100B Protein Determination Management Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based initial result previous prospective study , multicenter interventional study necessary validate routine use biomarker .The ultimate goal include serum S100B assay current recommendation traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) management base study Kupperman et al . ( 2009 ) , mTBI account 5-8 % pediatric emergency admission France ( 60-100 per 100,000 child ) . The study Kuppermann et al . strongly dictated recommendation mTBI management French Society Emergency Medicine ( SFMU ) . Then , 2 publication , French Society Pediatrics ( SFP ) redact recommendation adjustment method recommendation clinical practice , use French High Authority Health ( HAS ) . The use serum S100B assay part management pediatric mTBI make possible reduce number additional examination , particular 30 % reduction number CCT-scans , resultant reduction radiation exposure , know risk factor cancer . The study protocol correspond diagnostic prospective , control , multicenter study use randomize step wedge cluster design , pediatric patient ( age ≤ 16 year ) present pediatric emergency room mTBI GCS score 15 benefit usual care ( `` conventional management '' arm ) control group , S100B management interventional group .</detailed_description>
