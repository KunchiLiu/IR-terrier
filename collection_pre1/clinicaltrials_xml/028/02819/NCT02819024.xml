	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study effect dexamethasone patient non-small cell lung cancer respond previous treatment . Drugs dexamethasone affect tumor grow respond treatment . Imaging test , fluoro-L-thymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography , use small amount radioactive substance show change tumor cell . Studying effect dexamethasone lung tumor use FLT positron emission tomography may help doctor plan good treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Effects Patients With Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using FLT Positron Emission Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect dexamethasone ( Dex ) treatment patient relapse non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) use 3'-fluorothymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure change tumor maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess reversibility Dex-mediated change tumor FLT retention follow withdrawal Dex . II . Measure tumor Glucocorticoid Receptor alpha expression ( GRÎ± ) recent patient biopsy sample . III . Analyze blood sample obtain image determine serum Dex concentration senescence marker circulate tumor cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 . Patients undergo 3 fluorothymidine F-18 ( 18F ) -FLT PET scan . One scan within 7 day prior start dexamethasone , one scan day 3 5th dose dexamethasone , one scan 6-9 day last dose dexamethasone .</detailed_description>
