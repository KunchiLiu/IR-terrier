	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize clinical trial test efficacy dexmedetomidine self-management sedative therapy ( SMST ) sample critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilator support . The investigator hypothesis self-management sedative therapy mechanically ventilate patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) , tailor individual needs efficacious nurse-administered sedative therapy reduce anxiety , may reduce duration mechanical ventilator support occurrence delirium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective study demonstrate efficacy conduct future , pragmatic effectiveness trial test whether self-management sedative therapy ( SMST ) superior nurse-administered sedative therapy day-to-day intensive care unit ( ICU ) practice . This efficacy trial power investigator primary , clinically relevant endpoint ( anxiety , duration mechanical ventilation , delirium presence ) , examines patient outcome adversely affect sedative administration practice , prolong ICU stay , alter mental status , diminish post-ICU quality life . This randomized clinical trial total 190 mechanically ventilated patient enrol maintain protocol address follow Specific Aims . The primary aim determine efficacy SMST compare nurse-administered sedative therapy anxiety , duration mechanical ventilation , presence delirium mechanically ventilated patient ( MVPs ) . The secondary aim compare level arousal sedative exposure mechanically ventilated patient ( MVPs ) randomize SMST MVPs receive nurse-administered sedative therapy . The investigator hypothesize SMST patient easily arousable , alert , expose less sedation receive nurse-administered sedative therapy . An exploratory aim compare post-ICU outcome ( physical/functional status , psychological well-being , health-related quality life ) MVPs randomize SMST receive nurse-administered sedative therapy .</detailed_description>
