	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether six-week exercise training programme , design patient Rheumatoid Arthritis , improve disease activity , inflammation , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscle strength , flexibility risk factor cardiovascular disease . Twenty four patient randomly assign intervention control group ( n=12 group ) . The intervention group undertake fully supervise structure exercise training programme , consist aerobic strength training exercise , take form two 70-minute group fitness class per week six week . These participant also undertake 30-minute walk time . The control group continue go normal daily activity . Measurements make intervention/control period , include assessment disease activity ( e.g. , gauge swollen tender patient ' joint use Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) ) assessments fitness and/or physical functioning ( e.g. , 200 meter time walk test , strength test , flexibility test , Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index ( HAQDI ) ) . Blood sample also collect patient intervention/control period measure marker inflammation , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) . The investigator also measure parameter link type II diabetes ( e.g. , fast glucose concentration ) factor implicate cardiovascular disease risk ( e.g. , lipid profile rest blood pressure ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Six-week Exercise Programme Undertaken Women With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) multi-system autoimmune disease characterise chronic inflammation ( i.e. , persistent inappropriate immune response ) . It primarily affect joint , cause swelling , pain , reduce muscle strength high biomarkers inflammation C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) . This immune response also result accelerate atherosclerotic process , decrease Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) damage cartilage affect joint . Until mid-1990s , patient RA traditionally advise avoid physical exercise , due concern may result progression joint damage ; hospital admission bed rest common practice . However , last 20 year , study show combined moderate-intensity aerobic exercise strength training , improve joint swelling , increase cardiorespiratory fitness strength , without exacerbate pain joint damage patient RA . Thus , American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) recommend patient RA walk cycle least 30 minute three time week moderate intensity 60 % 85 % maximum heart rate ( HRmax ) improve cardiorespiratory fitness . The ACSM also recommend static dynamic strength train large muscle group twice weekly , perform three set 8-10 repetition 50 % 80 % one repetition maximum ( 1RM ) . While establish exercise training limit disease activity , low systemic inflammation , unclear whether short ( e.g. , six-weeks ) feasible exercise training programme ( e.g. , two 70 minute session per week ) elicit effect commonly employ intervention demand ( e.g. , 3-12 month ; 3-5 session per week ) . In addition , unclear whether short intervention modify factor implicate non-communicable disease , type II diabetes cardiovascular risk ( e.g. , glucose control , lipid profile , blood pressure ) . Objectives : To examine six-week moderate intensity aerobic exercise muscle strengthen programme : - Results change disease activity . - Improves cardiorespiratory fitness , strength flexibility . - Reduces disease related inflammatory marker . - Reduces blood pressure , improve lipid profile improve glucose control . Study Design : Twenty-four patient randomise either exercise intervention ( n= 12 ) control group ( n = 12 ) . The exercise intervention consist combine aerobic strength train group-exercise intervention last six week , two class per week . All participant undergo assessment measure marker inflammation , disease activity , physical fitness , strength , flexibility cardiovascular risk factor six-week intervention . Recruitment : Female patient age 18 69 year age RA attend Rheumatology outpatient clinic Belfast Social Health Care Trust hospital invite participate . Patients satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion would like take part attend two appointment randomise either six-week exercise intervention control group . Following six-week intervention patient return two appointment repeat measurement take intervention . Measurements six-week intervention . - Experimental Visit One . This visit schedule 08:00-09:00 ( duration 1 hour ) . Following write consent blood sample , blood pressure , anthropometry , joint examination , questionnaire carry . All patient , group , advise arrive fast last meal eaten great 12 hour arrival . Patients refrain exercise 48 hour , abstain alcohol caffeine 24 hour . - Experimental Visit Two . This visit schedule 12:00-16:00 ( duration 1 hour ) consist 200 metre walk test , sit reach flexibility test , strength test . Measurements six-week intervention : - Experimental Visit Three . This visit schedule 08:00-09:00 ( duration 1 hour ) . It identical visit one . Measurements include blood sample , blood pressure , anthropometry , joint examination , questionnaire . All participant group advise arrive fast last meal eat least 12 hour arrival . Patients refrain exercise 48 hour , abstain alcohol caffeine 24 hour . - Experimental Visit Four . This visit schedule 12:00-16:00 ( duration 1 hour ) identical visit two consist 200 metre walk test , sit reach flexibility test , strength test . Exercise Intervention : The six-week exercise programme comprise two 70-minute group exercise class per week ( usually 12 patient per class ) . Classes fully supervise conduct fitness rehabilitation gymnasium . Each class consist four part ( A-D , see ) . Participants also ask go moderate intensity walk week 30 minute maintain exercise diary exercise include gym session . A . Warm stretch five minute : The warm-up begin stand raise knee alternately 30 second follow gentle stretch large muscle group : lumbar , quadriceps , hamstring , groin , pectoral , triceps , biceps , hand foot muscle ; stretch group last 30 second . Stretches modify patient supportive prop use necessary . B. Aerobic exercise 30 minute : Aerobic exercise consist 30 minute cycle stationary cycle ergometer . This begin five-minute , low-intensity warm-up ( low intensity Heart Rate ( HR ) &lt; 50 % age predict HRmaximum ) . Intensity increase 60 % HRmax 20 minute , end five-minute low intensity cool-down . The exercise programme progressive , week increase intensity 5 % HRmax 85 % HRmax final week . Patients wear wrist chest heart-rate monitor , advise reach required intensity . This recorded class exercise diary along minute cycle . Progression intensity begin week two allow familiarisation programme . C. Strengthening exercise 30 minute : This consist five exercise , work large muscle upper limb , low limbs abdomen : leg extension , bench press , low row , modify abdominal crunch wall squat . Leg extension low row perform pulley weight machine bench press use multi-gym system . One repetition maximum ( RM ) maximum weight kilogram lift . Each exercise start three set 8-10 repetition 60 % 1RM , progress 5 % 1RM week . RM recalculate weekly week two . Modified abdominal crunch begin assess maximum number crunch patient perform near exhaustion . The participant perform number two time 90 second rest . After two week progress recalculate number crunch near exhaustion week . The wall squat start assessment time patient hold squat become fatigue . This repeated twice , 90 second rest . After two week progress re-timing wall squat fatigue , week thereafter . A record exercise perform , along weight lift , time , heart rate document weekly patient record sheet . D. Cool-down : Five minute light stretch large muscle group instruction perform moderate intensity walk weekend . The cooI-down identical warm-up .</detailed_description>
