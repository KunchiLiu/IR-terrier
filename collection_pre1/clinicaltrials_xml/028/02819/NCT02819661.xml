	<brief_title>Respiratory Depression Women With BMI≥30 Underwent Spinal Anesthesia With Intrathecal Morphine Elective C-section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1979 , intrathecal morphine combine spinal anesthesia show provide effective postoperative analgesia variety surgery specifically caesarean section . The advantage addition morphine spinal analgesia prolong analgesia operation post operatively . In addition analgesia provide use single injection time surgery need complex costly instrument like opioid pump . The side effect risk intrathecal morphine include : nausea , vomit , pruritus urinary retention severe respiratory depression ( immediate delay ) . The mild side effect higher postoperatively patient receive spinal anesthesia combine morphine . In meta-analysis study different surgery perform spinal anesthesia , show low dos ( &lt; 0.3mg ) intrathecal morphine increase rate respiratory depression . Nonetheless high dos ( &gt; 0.3mg ) associate incident respiratory depression . In another study evidence respiratory depression follow caesarean section spinal anesthesia combine morphine . Yet , prospective study review 856 case caesarean section spinal anesthesia combine morphine rate 8 incidence respiratory depression find . In retrospective study 1915 case woman undergo caesarean section spinal anesthesia combine morphine rate 0.25 % respiratory depression report . The definition respiratory depression lack response hypercapnia and/or hypoxia show intrathecal morphine depress response . The common parameter monitor order detect respiratory depression include respiratory rate , sedation score , pulse oximetry , high PCo2 level need naloxone treatment . However , overall measurement frequency respiratory depression postoperatively variable . Accounting variability fact hypercapnia may occur patient normal respiratory rate , normal sedation score normal oxygen saturation . In addition , respiratory depression detect high level PCo2 may recognize early parameter . The risk factor find associated respiratory depression include high BMI , prior opioid use , magnesium infusion respiratory comorbidities In study 856 woman 8 experienced oxygen desaturation sleep . All woman extremely obese prior history deep snoring . In study investigator would like examine whether difference frequency episodes respiratory depression obese ( BMI≥30 ) woman normal BMI receive spinal anesthesia combine intrathecal morphine elective caesarean section . In previous study report obese non-obese woman respond differently modest dos spinal anesthesia . Hence study investigator certain investigator examine influence addition morphine spinal anesthesia .</detailed_description>
