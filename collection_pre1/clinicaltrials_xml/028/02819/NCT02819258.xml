	<brief_summary>Endodontic therapy achieve eviction inflame infected pulp fill canal opening hermetic seal material . The analysis literature intracanal therapeutic show great variability result obtain , report success rate 53 95 % . This explain difficulty surgical procedure , also multiplicity possible factor failure , related practitioner , canal anatomy , operate procedure , preparation technique root canal filling . This success rate variable depend presence absence periapical pathology treatment : 85 % teeth treat without initial periapical pathology 62 % teeth pathology treatment . Furthermore , literature review reveal two contradictory assumption dominant factor failure endodontics : failure seal canal system ( bad level shutter ) failure endovascular disinfection . Main hypothesis research objective : The probability success year endodontic treatment carry accord recommendation operating standard teeth periapical pathology approximately 60 % . The primary prognostic factor would existence intracanal obstacle ( stop calcification ... ) responsible sub-obturation canal , factor inherent tooth ( situation ductal anatomy complexity ) , operate technique use , practitioner ( skill level ) , quality restoration .</brief_summary>
