	<brief_summary>Diarrhea relatively common complication patient cancer . At inception , several mechanism participate ; malabsorption basis mucositis induce chemotherapy , dysbiosis induce broad-spectrum antibiotic predisposition infectious diarrhea immunocompromised patient . Some cytostatics metabolite also induce diarrhea directly due effect intestinal mucosa . Use probiotics prevention treatment diarrhea rely theoretical assumption result several clinical trial . Lactic acid bacteria involve treatment dysbiosis , compete substrate pathogenic bacteria , produce bacterio-cins , increase transepithelial resistance . Their enzymatic activity affect activation deactivation metabolite cause diarrhea . Production short chain fatty acid , important maintenance intestinal mucosal cell also contribute antidiarrhoeal effect . This randomized , double-blind , placebo control , multicentre trial design evaluate potential probiotic prevent grade 3-4 diarrhea patient treat irinotecan base chemotherapy first 6 week irinotecan base chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Irinotecan Induced Diarrhea Probiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prevent antibiotic-induced diarrhea double blind placebo control clinical trial find protective effect probiotic contain S. boulardii Enterococcus faecium . Also prevent infectious disease associate Clostridium difficile , administration probiotic result significant decrease disease recurrence . Duration rotavirus diarrhea , child immunocompromised HIV-positive patient significantly shorten administration strain Lactobacilli S. boulardii respectively . Meta-analysis 9 randomize , placebo-controlled trial show significant reduction incidence antibiotic associate diarrhea child . Another meta-analysis 23 study include show significant reduction risk infectious diarrhea . Most study carry probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG® . The incidence diarrhea treatment acute leukemia 15 80 % . Severe diarrhea level 3 4 present 8-20 % much common induction phase chemotherapy . In phase II study perform NCI Slovakia preventive administration Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain M-74 selenium associate low incidence ( 14 % ) severity ( grade 1 ) diarrhea , despite fact half patient receive induction therapy . The investigator note safety probiotic strain 370 day severe neutropenia Gr 3-4 . The incidence irinotecan induce diarrhea varies 60-90 % , incidence severe diarrhea 20-40 % . In phase II study , incidence 17 % NCI Slovakia , irinotecan dose reduce 25 % patient . Diarrhea important factor morbidity mortality irinotecan base chemotherapy . Predisposing factor age 65 year , ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) PS ( Performance status ) 1 previous abdominopelvic radiation . One irinotecan metabolite , SN-38 ( 7-ethyl-10 hydroxycamptothecin ) , glucuronidated liver subsequently expel intestine main cause diarrhea . Due bacterial enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase deconjugated intestinal lumen . This form cause direct damage intestinal mucosa associate malabsorption water , electrolytes development diarrhea . Reduction activity intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase use broad-spectrum antibiotic and/or beta-D-glucuronidase inhibitor one way avoid irinotecan induced diarrhea . It also possible modulate metabolism irinotecan use cyclosporine phenobarbital reduce biliary excretion SN-38 induction glucuronidation . Promising result show use activated charcoal , result absorption SN-38 . Also method test : oral alkalization , thalidomide , amifostine , without success . These procedure study phase II trial . It known probiotic bacteria , reduce activity intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase therefore bacteria could apply prevention diarrhea patient treat irinotecan base therapy . Results phase III study , prematurely terminate due poor accrual show benefit Colon Dophilus irinotecan induce gastrointestinal toxicity . In trial , 46 patient colorectal cancer start new line irinotecan base therapy enrol . 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine along irinotecan administer 26 ( 56.5 % ) patient 22 ( 47.8 % ) patient receive biological therapy well . Patients randomize 1:1 probiotic ( PRO ) placebo arm ( PLA ) . Probiotic formula Colon Dophilus , administer dose 10x109 CFU ( colony form unit ) bacteria tid , orally 12 week chemotherapy . Primary endpoint incidence grade 3/4 diarrhea . 23 patient randomized PRO 23 patient PLA . Administration probiotic compare placebo lead reduction incidence severe diarrhea grade 3 4 ( 0 % PRO vs. 17.4 % PLA , p = 0.11 ) , well reduction overall incidence diarrhea ( 39.1 % PRO vs. 60.9 % PLA , p = 0.24 ) incidence enterocolitis ( 0 % PRO vs. 8.7 % PLA ) . Patients PRO use less loperamide compare PLA ( mean duration loperamide use : 4.5 day PRO vs. 10.4 day PLA , p = 0.45 ; mean number loperamide tablet : 5.9 PRO vs. 37.7 PLA , p = 0.49 ) . There infection cause probiotic strain record . Two recent study murine model show , bacteria gut enhance body 's immune response cancer , mobilize immune cell kill cancer cell , gut throughout body well . The researcher also find bacteria affect efficacy three different cancer treatment . Given low toxicity , good tolerability , probiotic may important part supportive therapy moreover enhance efficacy anticancer therapy . The objective phase III . trial determine effectiveness probiotic formula PROBIO-FIX INUM® prophylaxis irinotecan induce diarrhea due reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity biochemical physiological action specific strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . lactis BB-12® Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG® , LGG® active substance use food supplement - PROBIO-FIX INUM® . Both strain well-documented . LGG® study 800 scientific publication . Studies find LGG® support immunity , enhance antibody formation viral infection , decrease incidence gastrointestinal infection , antibiotic associate diarrhoea , respiratory infection . In addition well-researched health benefit , safety LGG® widely study probiotic bacterium . It safe history use food extensively document 200 clinical study . The large number clinical study scientific publication indicate BB-12® probiotic strain - alone combination probiotic strain ( e.g . LGG® ) - may beneficial effect regard gastrointestinal immune area . BB-12® consider best study probiotic bifidobacteria , describe 360 scientific study .</detailed_description>
