	<brief_title>The Combination Effect Statin Plus Metformin Relapse-free</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study reveal population-based cohort study investigate protective effect statin metformin cancer event patient HBV infection . The study demonstrate either statin metformin serve independent chemopreventive agent dose-response effect reduce incidence cancer dose-response effect agent additive synergistic effect combine statin metformin use reduce incidence many cancers.1 And base data animal model , administration metformin statin might enhance therapeutic effect local tumor apoptotic antiangiogenesis pathway . These result also seem synergistic effect statin metformin combine use tumor control.2 The aim study clarify potential protective benefit drug combination effect Statin plus Metformin relapse-free survival HCC patient local treatment patient HBV .</detailed_description>
