	<brief_title>Dropless™ vs. Less Drops™ Pharmaceutical Regimens After Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern cataract surgery become relatively short out-patient procedure small incision short post-operative recovery time . Surgery influence surgical technique experience . Prophylactic pharmaceutical regimen design control post-operative pain reduce potential inflammation ( i.e . macular edema , CME ) infection ( i.e . endophthalmitis ) . The serious potential infection relate cataract surgery endophthalmitis . Endophthalmitis result microorganism enter eye , either surgical procedure surgical incision heal completely . The risk infection reduce several way . Pre-operatively , reduce bacteria cornea ocular adnexa helpful . During surgery , appropriate technique reduce potential ingres . Post-operatively , prophylactic antibiotic eliminate organism enter eye . Topical drop , intracameral antibiotic subconjunctival injection typical option current use , usually select basis spectrum coverage , cost , efficacy and/or expect side effect . With regard inflammation , one common post-operative response cystoid macular edema ( CME ) . Steroids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) appear effective reduce incidence CME , NSAIDs pose low risk IOP spike show great efficacy study . While documented evidence utility prophylactic post-operative treatment pain infection , patient compliance remain significant concern . The regimen often complex , multiple drop several time per day . Inability instill drop , forgetfulness lack appreciation importance compliance contribute factor . There several new option try address potential issue relate poor patient compliance . One refer `` dropless '' cataract surgery , involve injection multi-drug compound eye time cataract surgery ; one compound include triamcinolone acetonide , moxifloxacin hydrochloride vancomycin ( TriMoxiVanc ) . Another alternative reduce burden pharmaceutical regimen use compounded topical medication ; term `` less drops '' cataract surgery . An option regard topical formulation prednisolone acetate , moxifloxacin hydrochloride ketorolac tromethamine ( PredMoxiKetorolac ) , give one week post-operatively follow topical formulation prednisolone acetate ketorolac tromethamine ( PredKeterolac ) give week 2 4 surgery . The purpose study evaluate difference performance dropless less-drops pharmaceutical regimen cataract surgery .</detailed_description>
