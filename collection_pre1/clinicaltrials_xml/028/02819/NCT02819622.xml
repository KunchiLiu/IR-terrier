	<detailed_description>Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSCR ) characterize serous macular detachment fourth common retinal disease age-related macular degeneration , diabetic retinopathy retinal vein occlusion . In population-based retrospective cohort case control study Olmsted county , Minnesota , USA , Kitzmann et al4 report mean age-adjusted incidence 9.9 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 7.4-12.4 ) per 100 , 000 men , 1.7 ( 95 % CI 0.7-2.7 ) woman . The mean age onset CSCR appear 41 45 years5 . The disease affect various racial groups5-8 occasionally familial9 . The pathogenesis remain poorly understood currently exudation think result hyper-permeable choroid secondary venous stasis , ischemia , inflammation2 . Because lack proper animal model lack definite cure , clinical research focus risk factor stress , corticosteroid intake , type A personality . Different hospital-based study yield different risk factor . Epidemiologic study fail ascertain many risk factor . Due different methodology ( retrospective vs. prospective case-control study ; selection control ; questionnaire vs. interview physician assistant vs. interview physician ) focus single risk factor literature , investigator design study target vast number know potential risk factor various collaborative center compare result report literature .</detailed_description>
