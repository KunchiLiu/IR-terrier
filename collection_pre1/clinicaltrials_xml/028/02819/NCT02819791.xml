	<detailed_description>Chronic cardiovascular disease second cause death France , represent major public health issue . Recurrences numerous , due inadequate control cardiovascular risk factor , despite significant drug prescription . Therapeutic education help improve health patient , physical psychical . The Exploration Center Prevention Treatment Atherosclerosis ( CEPTA , Bordeaux Hospital University ) demonstrate follow myocardial infarction stroke , comprehensive care ( medical educational ) patient CEPTA lead result satisfactory term reduction cardiovascular risk morbidity mortality . However , specific effect therapeutic education beyond conventional treatment never proper assessment . This study single-center prospective , randomize , control . The main objective find explain impact `` therapeutic education program '' addition optimize conventional therapy post-MI stroke patient , compare optimized conventional therapy alone . Patients randomized hospitalization acute phase two group 165 patient . The first group receive conventional therapy alone 2nd group receive conventional treatment + therapeutic education program . All patient benefit traditional monitoring provide type patient , follow 3 month 1 year . In first day acute event , patient benefit appropriate treatment receive guidance change lifestyle , diet smoke cessation . Optimal treatment prescribe output depend cardiovascular status risk factor . Three month cardiovascular event , patient benefit assessment atherosclerosis consequence myocardial neurological function . Each patient receive assessment risk factor ( smoking , dietary habit physical activity ) . Personalized advice issue . One participant group receive `` conventional treatment + therapeutic education program ( CEPTA program ) '' . The objective therapeutic education associate : - Of learn objective acquisition knowledge self-care skill make patient autonomous facilitate adherence . - objective acquire cop skill ( self-confidence , stress management , set project ) improve quality life . - development objective respect relevant criterion quality , realism principle educational progress . The challenge project demonstrate first time superiority conventional treatment + therapeutic education population , propose model program national broadcast .</detailed_description>
