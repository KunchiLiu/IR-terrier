	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Radiation Necrosis : Stereotactic radiosurgery become integral treatment brain tumor arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) . In 10 % case , lead radiation necrosis ( RN ) significant surround vasogenic edema mass effect . Medical treatment RN include steroid , vitamin E , pentoxiphylline , hyperbaric oxygen . Up 20 % case however , medically refractory experience progressive neurological decline disable headache . Bevacizumab : Bevacizumab ( Avastin , Genentech BioOncology , South San Francisco , CA ) recombinant humanize version murine anti-human vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) monoclonal antibody . Recently , bevacizumab show small randomized control trial ( n=14 ) effective treatment refractory radiation necrosis radiation therapy brain tumors1 . Patients receive 7.5 mg/kg IV-Bevacizumab every 3 week 4 cycle . All patient receive Bevacizumab none patient receive placebo significant clinical radiographic improvement . PRE-CLINICAL DATA Role vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) radiation necrosis VEGF implicate pathophysiology radiation necrosis . Reactive astrocyte immediately surround necrotic core RN strongly VEGF-positive immunohistochemistry . It postulate radiation cause microvascular injury lead hypoxia . Hypoxia-induced VEGF up-regulation drive increase vascular permeability , lead extensive vasogenic edema see RN . Bevacizumab bind circulate VEGF receptor high specificity , block down-stream signal cascade . CLINICAL DATA : Bevacizumab originally develop test anti-angiogenic treatment various solid tumor . More recently , IV-Bevacizumab show small , randomize control trial ( n=14 ) effective treatment refractory radiation necrosis radiation therapy brain tumors1 . Patients receive 7.5 mg/kg IV-Bevacizumab every 3 week 4 cycle . All patient receive Bevacizumab none patient receive placebo significant clinical radiographic improvement . This improvement durable 10 month 8 11 patient ( 4 patient cross control group ) . There however , high rate adverse event ( 60 % ) , major adverse event ( 30 % . Major adverse event include venous sinus thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , aspiration pneumonia . The investigator recently publish case series two pediatric patient highly symptomatic steroid refractory radiation necrosis brain stereotactic radiosurgery treatment cerebral arteriovenous malformations3 . Both patient refractory accept medical therapy . Both steroid dependent prolong period severely cushingoid . Both suffer significant decline quality life severe headache need withdraw school . In instance , patient make remarkable progressive clinical radiographic improvement receive single 2.5 mg/kg dose intra-arterial bevacizumab , durable one-year later . To increase bevacizumab penetration brain , investigator use intra-arterial Mannitol disrupt blood-brain barrier immediately prior target intra-arterial drug administration . RATIONALE : RATIONALE : CURRENT IV BEVACIZUMAB REGIMEN FOR RADIATION NECROSIS AND ITS ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY : Current IV-bevacizumab regimen use dose 7.5 mg/kg every 3 week 4 cycle . There significant known side effect bevacizumab include gastrointestinal perforation , deep venous thrombosis , venous sinus thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , intracranial hemorrhage , wound dehiscence , severe hypertension . These complication common anti-angiogenic class drug reflect systemic exposure bevacizumab . In initial clinical experience , investigator utilized combination IA-route delivery BBB disruption reduce bevacizumab dose maintain efficacy . This support durable clinical radiographic response patient single 2.5 mg/kg dose bevacizumab . The investigator believe approach reduce incidence serious systemic toxicity compare IV-bevacizumab regimen ( 7.5-15 mg/kg every 2-3 week several week month ) . There multiple recent report patient radiation necrosis improve IV-bevacizumab , relapse month later . In fact 3/11 patient randomize controlled trial discuss require repeat treatment IV-bevacizumab RN symptom progression1 . In contrast , two patient series receive IA-bevacizumab continue show progressive clinical radiographic improvement one year later . The investigator believe increase penetration bevacizumab brain intra-arterial administration blood-brain barrier disruption result bind virtually VEGF molecule . The fact result durable progressively improve suggests massive block VEGF activity could stop positive feedback loop inflammation . Therefore , IA-bevacizumab may result effective durable control radiation necrosis compare traditional IV-bevacizumab treatment . RATIONALE : INTRA-ARTERIAL ( IA ) ROUTE OF BEVACIZUMAB ADMINISTRATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE DRUG DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN : IA-therapy decrease volume dilution drug circulation reduce first-pass degradation via proteolytic catabolism , result high drug delivery target brain tissue . Super-selective IA-injection 99mTc-HMPAO ( Ceretec® ) human cerebral artery achieve concentration radiotracer brain tissue 50 time higher IV injection . In clinical study cerebral chemotherapy , concentration deliver tumor use intra-arterial injection versus intravenous administration chemotherapeutic agent five time higher hydrosoluble drug 50 time higher liposoluble drug . The investigator infuse bevacizumab artery supply territory affect RN , cervical internal carotid artery and/or cervical vertebral artery . RATIONALE : BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER BREAKDOWN PRIOR TO INTRA-ARTERIAL THERAPY FURTHER ENHANCES DRUG DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN : The blood-brain-barrier selective permeability barrier block entry many drug brain . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody high molecular weight ( 149 kDa ) . There convince evidence literature concentration brain high molecular weight molecule significantly increase osmotic BBB disruption . Several tumor clinical trial show localization monoclonal antibody brain poor without BBB disruption ( 0.0006 % -0.0043 % injected dose/g tumor ) . There also evidence 20-fold increase permeability immunoreactive IgM Mab BBB disruption rat . The investigator believe use blood-brain-barrier disruption significantly increase delivery Bevacizumab affect brain . The investigator use protocol described Neuwelt colleague , use infusion 25 % Mannitol 30 second . This protocol show temporarily disrupt blood brain barrier , peak 15 minute dissipate 4 hour . IA-chemotherapy follow BBBD show feasible safe across multiple center low incidence complications27 . The efficacy safety profile reproducible across multiple center . In fact , safety protocol establish 6000 patient treat worldwide BBBD intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion . The main possible complication seizure , occur &lt; 6 % case . It important note seizure generally occur patient widespread malignant pathology Glioblastoma CNS lymphoma treat toxic chemotherapy agent immediately BBBD . Recent refinement osmotic BBBD protocol incorporate use general anesthesia , well prophylaxis anti-epileptic agent Valium reduce seizure threshold chance seizure . SAFETY OF CEREBRAL INTRA-ARTERIAL BEVACIZUMAB TREATMENT : Safety IA-Bevacizumab treatment hyperosmotic BBBD recently establish series malignant glioma patient . This do super-selective injection intracranial tumor arterial pedicle purpose anti-tumor effect . Dose-escalation perform 2 mg/kg 15 mg/kg without reach maximal tolerate dose . There significant decrease contrast enhance FLAIR signal characteristic tumor surround brain one month treatment . Overall toxicity cohort comparable previous report IV Bevacizumab therapy . Specifically , hyperosmotic BBB-breakdown follow IA-Bevacizumab administration cause direct neurotoxicity ; case intracranial hemorrhage . Multiple report BBBD follow intra-arterial bevacizumab treatment pathology vestibular schwannoma , ependymoma , malignant brainstem glioma also demonstrate good safety profile obvious neurotoxicity . TREATMENT PLAN : VASCULAR ACCESS , CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM , AND OSMOTIC BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER DISRUPTION : The investigator use protocol described Neuwelt colleague , use infusion 25 % Mannitol 30 second . The safety protocol establish 6000 patient treat worldwide BBBD intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion . The patient premedicated 6 mg Dexamethasone 1000 mg Keppra . General endotracheal anesthesia induce . The femoral artery access use Seldinger technique . A 5-French diagnostic catheter use catheterize cervical internal carotid artery ipsilateral area radiation necrosis . Baseline internal carotid angiogram perform . The anesthesiologist instruct maintain SBP &gt; 120 pre-operative baseline , whichever value high . This important efficient bulk flow drug blood brain barrier opening . The catheter position C1-2 level cervical internal carotid artery C6-7 vertebral artery infusion . Optimal rate Mannitol infusion determine perform injection contrast 4 ml/sec 3 second vessel . If reflux contrast external carotid artery , injection rate injection increase 2 ml/sec maximum 12 ml/sec . The low rate reflux external carotid artery choose ( rate exceed cerebral blood flow . Next , 5 mg IV Valium 0.2 mg IV Atropine administer . Warm ( 37 degree Co ) 25 % Mannitol filter 5-micron filter , infused ipsilateral cervical carotid artery rate determine total 30 second . INTRA-ARTERIAL BEVACIZUMAB ADMINISTRATION : Test injection contrast do artery . If evidence catheter-induced vasospasm , catheter may withdraw proximally within artery . Repeat test injection contrast do document resolution vasospasm . Within 5 minute Mannitol infusion , 2.5 mg/kg bevacizumab volume 100 ml administer artery 10 minute . Repeat angiogram perform document BBBD , well rule thromboembolic phenomenon .</detailed_description>
