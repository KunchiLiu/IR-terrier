	<brief_summary>Aspiration pneumonia dread complication anaesthesia prevalence ( 1/3,886 case elective anaesthesia 1/895 case emergency setting ) high morbidity mortality ( 3 9 % ) . This chemical and/or infectious pneumonia secondary passage gastric content unprotected upper airways general anaesthesia . The prognosis depend three factor : presence food debris , acidity volume gastric content . To prevent complication , French society anaesthesia intensive care recommend preoperative fasting rule , patient present risk factor aspiration , use antacid rapid sequence intubation . This preventive strategy associate certain adverse event : defer operative procedure , discomfort hypoglycaemia secondary fasting , frequent anaphylactic complication , memory anaesthetic induction . Over recent year , ultrasound become widely used anaesthetist local anaesthesia , vascular catheterization , haemodynamic monitoring , recently , 2D ultrasound estimation intragastric volume . However , 2D ultrasound estimation intragastric volume present several limitation : complex shape stomach , technique require long learning curve measure volume poorly correlate reference technique ( MRI 99Tc scintigraphy ) . Two study recently measure intragastric volume three dimensional ultrasound promising result .</brief_summary>
