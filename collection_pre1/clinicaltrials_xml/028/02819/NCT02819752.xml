	<brief_summary>This study aim establish whether combination pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) conventional cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy tolerable result acceptable level acute late toxicity patient stage IV LA-SCCHN . In particular , study provide data level mucosal cutaneous toxicity within radiation field , primary acute toxicity associate treatment regimen . In addition , toxicity outside radiation portal ( may theoretically exacerbate radiation ) study . However , toxicity monitor . This study also give indication activity pembrolizumab LA-SCCHN deliberately select group patient high- intermediate-risk disease significant chance experience loco-regional systemic failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEmbrolizumab Combined With Chemoradiotherapy Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre phase 1 dose-escalation study confirm safety combine pembrolizumab standard platin-based chemoradiotherapy patient stage IV high- intermediate-risk locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( LA-SCCHN ) . 6-36 patient ( 18 HPV+ve 18 HPV-ve ) recruit standard 3+3 dose-escalation trial design expansion cohort maximum tolerate dose ( 200 mg , DLT define ) . A pre-loading dose 100 200mg ( dependent dose level ) pembrolizumab give patient complete screening period . Patients return 2 week later begin cycle 1 regimen pembrolizumab 3 weekly dose 100 200mg ( dependent dose level ) total 7 cycle ( 3 chemoradiotherapy 4 chemoradiotherapy ) . Parallel study HPV-ve HPV +ve disease conduct ( note patient may different pattern co-morbidity , hence , different treatment-related toxicity ) . The primary endpoint study safety tolerability . Dose-limiting acute toxicity assess administration study drug accord CTCAEv4.0 . The maximum tolerate dose study drug ( 200 mg absence DLT ) use subsequent randomised phase 2 study compare standard-of-care therapy standard-of-care therapy plus study drug .</detailed_description>
