	<brief_title>Corticosteroid Mediates Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) cause inflammatory injury lung characterize clinically acute hypoxemic respiratory failure . Pathologically complex change lung manifest early , exudative phase follow proliferative fibrotic phase . Persistent ARDS characterize ongoing inflammation , parenchymal-cell proliferation , disorder deposition collagen , may responsive corticosteroid therapy . Systemic corticosteroid consider potentially beneficial therapy . However , several study fail provide convince evidence prove efficacy corticosteroid decrease mortality ARDS . For secondary outcome , oxygenation improvement reduction duration mechanical ventilation , show consistent finding favor corticosteroid therapy . However , underlie mechanisms account anti-inflammatory action corticosteroid ARDS patient yet elucidate , activity appear control single mechanism . Interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) , along interleukin-1b ( IL-1b ) , produce inflammasomes activated number pathogen , environmental host-derived danger signal . Inflammasomes innate immune regulatory protein complex seem play key role host immune response patient ARDS . The aim study determine IL-18 level serum patient ARDS investigate whether corticosteroid could attenuate level .</detailed_description>
