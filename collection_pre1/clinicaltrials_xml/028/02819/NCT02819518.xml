	<brief_summary>The study consist two part . In Part 1 , safety pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) combination one three different chemotherapy assess treatment locally recurrent inoperable metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) , previously treat chemotherapy . In Part 2 , safety efficacy pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy assess compare safety efficacy placebo plus chemotherapy treatment locally recurrent inoperable metastatic TNBC , previously treat chemotherapy . The primary hypothesis combination pembrolizumab chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) compare placebo chemotherapy participant participant program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive tumor , prolongs Overall Survival ( OS ) compare placebo chemotherapy participant participant PD-L1 positive tumor .</brief_summary>
