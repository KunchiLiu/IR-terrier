	<brief_summary>Obesity adverse cardiometabolic consequence major public health problem . Several feature obesity contribute associate cardiovascular risk potential target intervention . These include insulin resistance beta cell dysfunction , reduce metabolic rate , impair aerobic capacity.The purpose study examine phosphodiesterase type 5A inhibitor tadalafil improve cardiometabolic health individual obese insulin resistant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PDE5 Inhibition Obesity-Related Cardiometabolic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity risk factor nearly cardiovascular ( CV ) disease include coronary artery disease , hypertension , heart failure . Increased CV risk obese individual appear depend largely degree metabolic dysregulation metabolic risk factor ( glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia , etc. ) . Notably , intervention improve insulin sensitivity cardiorespiratory fitness reduce CV risk obese individual , even absence weight loss . The cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway ( cGMP ) involve energy homeostasis systemic metabolism . Multiple line evidence suggest increase cGMP activity beneficial metabolic standpoint . Tadalafil clinically-available drug inhibits enzyme break cGMP . The study investigator hypothesize chronic PDE5 inhibition obese , insulin-resistant adult improve cardiometabolic health . Aim 1 : To examine effect PDE5 inhibition energy expenditure . Aim 2 : To examine effect PDE5 inhibition insulin sensitivity secretion . Aim 3 : To examine effect PDE5 inhibition cGMP tone circulate mediator cardiometabolic risk .</detailed_description>
