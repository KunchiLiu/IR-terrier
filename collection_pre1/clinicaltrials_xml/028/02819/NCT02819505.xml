	<brief_summary>Carnosine ( make bond β-alanine histidine ) suggest contribute extension physical exercise , counteract decline muscle performance due fatigue . However process largely restricted level β-alanine available human body . Carnosine level raise long term ingestion food product , meat , fish poultry , however also significantly increase β-alanine supplementation . Improved β-alanine level potentially advance exercise capacity exercise performance , may previously limit . Recently research demonstrate beneficial effect β-alanine supplementation neuromuscular performance active , healthy male well rest , prior exercise fatigue assess muscle . It remain unknown β-alanine supplementation would aid physical performance muscle already fatigue . This currently investigate old adult ( 60-80 year ) , however clear comparison potential effect young old participant . Therefore investigation hop examine effect 4 week β-alanine supplementation lower limb contractile force property , pre post muscle specific fatigue 18-30 year old male .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carnosine ( β-alanyl-L-histidine ) naturally occur dipeptide form bonding histidine β-alanine reaction catalyse carnosine synthase . One role carnosine within human system , intracellular pH buffer due pKa 6.83 . Carnosine suitable whole exercise induce intramuscular pH transit-range . Carnosine untrained population neutralise 2.4 10.1mmol H+.kg-1 dry mass muscle intramuscular pH decline , add least 7 % 10 % total intramuscular buffering capacity . It also argue carnosine combination anserine contribute much 40 % buffering capacity pH range 6.5 7.5. β-alanine suggest rate limit factor muscle carnosine synthesis , ingestion β-alanine diet ( meat , fish poultry ) via short-term supplementation , demonstrate significant increase muscle carnosine concentration . Increases carnosine concentration 40 % 80 % show , depend upon dose ( 3.2 6.4 g·d-1 ) duration administration ( 4 10 week ) . Increasing β-alanine concentration therefore enhance carnosine synthesis muscle fiber improve intramuscular buffering capacity . Exercise performance capacity measurements previously limit accumulation H+ demonstrate significant improvement supplementation β-alanine . Research already conduct Nottingham Trent University approve ethical advisory committee demonstrate significant effect β-alanine supplementation neuromuscular performance healthy , active male . However , research conduct well rested participant , prior exercise fatigue assess muscle ; therefore accumulation H+ demonstrate within muscle . These previous investigation therefore contemplate β-alanine supplementation alters performance intramuscular buffering alter ( start exercise ) , whereas propose study examine effect β-alanine supplementation performance intramuscular pH already challenge ( due fatigue exercise ) . It hypothesise β-alanine supplementation 4 week beneficially alter contractile force property muscle fibre within low limb muscle , improve physical performance muscle already fatigue . Aims project : To examine effect 4 week β-alanine supplementation knee extensor contractile force property , pre post induced muscle specific fatigue 18-30 year old male .</detailed_description>
