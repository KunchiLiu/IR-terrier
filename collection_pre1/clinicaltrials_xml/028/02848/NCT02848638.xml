	<brief_summary>The primary goal study see PET/CT able determine precise location Y-90 particle within liver within tumor . We hope use information order see particle distribute evenly throughout large tumor particle go tumor locate portal vein . The secondary goal threefold . First correlate distribution Y90 particle ( demonstrated PET/CT ) degree dead-tumor tissue . Second , see difference Y90 particle 's distribution low particle load ( 1-3 million particle ) use compare high particle load ( 6-8 million particle ) use . Lastly , compare sensitivity standard imaging ( bremsstrahlung image ) currently use Yttrium-90 angioembolization procedure sensitivity pair production PET research imaging .</brief_summary>
