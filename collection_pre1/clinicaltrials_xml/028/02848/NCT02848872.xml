	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study functional tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) isolation resect lung cancer specimens feasible , allow determination tumor antigen-specific T cell reactivity . The primary objective study investigate feasibility isolate functional tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) determine tumor antigen-specific T cell re-activities 30 resect lung tumor specimens . Successful isolation TILs define collect 1x10-6 viable , CD45+ mononuclear cell great tumor contain &gt; /=1 gram excess tissue . If successful isolation TILs obtain &gt; /= 66 % resected tumor specimen , protocol consider feasible . The primary exploratory objective identify immunologic signature predict clinical outcome cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigating tumor infiltrate lymphocytes Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) clinical importance multiple reason . Cellular , antigen , cytokine profile associate favorable clinical outcome therapy currently lack lung cancer , result may lead development clinically important prognostic predictive biomarkers . Additionally , determine specific cell type antigen target effector cell microenvironment , strategy devise alter mechanisms regulate tumor immune tolerance . These data may ultimately enable future , novel combinational approach anti-tumor therapy early phase clinical trial design improve clinical outcome patient lung cancer . Finally , correlate immunologic profile clinical outcome ( include pathologic response progression free survival ) , signatures derive help predict benefit cytotoxic chemotherapy patient receive treatment . This study plan enroll total 30 patient . This number consist combination early stage NSCLC patient receive neoadjuvant therapy , standard neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy , immune checkpoint therapy well patient metastatic disease undergoing tumor resection receive prior systemic therapy interest , include limited anti-PD1/PDL agent . Standard diagnostic staging work perform , include pathologic/histologic diagnosis cancer . Patients receive therapy deem appropriate treating physician per standard clinical care part clinical cancer trial . There randomization stratification . Patients receive information assays/research perform research purpose . Data patient extract medical record image . Data element extract include follow : age , sex , tumor histology stage , chemotherapy regimens immune-modulating therapy dose schedule , disease response ( outcomes ) . Tumor specimen sample collect time definitive surgical resection tumor . After specimen process margin status frozen section assessment specimen complete , specimen excess tumor ( least 1gm ) release acquire tumor immunology correlative science staff isolation tumor infiltrate lymphocyte purpose protocol remain tissue process Duke Biorepository staff subject consent biobanking . For subject decline participation biorepository tissue process outline . Blood collect prior surgery assess activate CD8+ T cell specificity tumor antigens CD4 CD8 functional memory .</detailed_description>
