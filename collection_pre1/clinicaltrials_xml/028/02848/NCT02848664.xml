	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop appropriate training method gather participant feedback use Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Training Device ( PMSST ) . The PMSST small device provide external vibratory stimulation larynx swallow swallow training . A secondary purpose study determine 3 month use PMSST affect swallow physiology , brain activation , oral intake quality life . This uncontrolled pilot study aim gain patient feedback use vibratory device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator currently develop Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer continue treatment dysphagia patient discharge home . The self-training device worn around neck motor place externally skin thyroid cartilage provide vibratory stimulation larynx . The vibration activate sensory receptor inside larynx excite CNS control swallow help patient initiate swallowing . Patients use self-training device home promote swallow rehabilitation daily swallow practice . The device also program vibrate regular interval throughout day promote saliva swallow . Using method , patient continue swallow therapy independently manner cost effective . A previous Phase I trial compare clinical outcome 8 patient chronic dysphagia use either intramuscular electrical stimulation implant device external vibratory stimulator practice swallow daily home ( FDA IDE G0G0153 ) . Functional outcome oral intake improved device . As external vibratory stimulation advantage external completely noninvasive , select development self-training device . A second pilot study examine effect different frequency vibration swallow frequency healthy participant find swallow significantly increase baseline use vibration 70 Hz one side larynx 110 Hz side . Data also collect effect different vibration characteristic swallow participant swallow problem stroke . Purpose : The purpose study allow patient chronic dysphagia use Self-Trainer daily swallow practice home collect feedback device use satisfaction use . Objective information effectiveness self-training swallow rehabilitation also gather . Objectives : 1 . To develop evaluate training participant caregiver use self-trainer . 2 . To gather participant feedback use device 3 month daily practice . 3 . To determine 3 month daily practice Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer affect swallow physiology , brain activation , oral intake , quality life participant chronic dysphagia .</detailed_description>
