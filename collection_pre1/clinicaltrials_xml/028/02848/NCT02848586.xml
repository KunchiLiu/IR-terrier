	<brief_title>Effects E-cigarettes ( ECIGs ) Pulmonary Inflammation Behavior HIV Infected Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : Effects e-cigarettes ( ECIGs ) pulmonary inflammation behavior HIV infect smoker Purpose Study : Even though smoke lead cause preventable disease death U.S. , million Americans continue smoke cigarette , include 40-70 % HIV-infected patient . The advent e-cigarettes potential risk reduction strategy reduce traditional tobacco cigarette use promote smoke cessation attractive . The goal propose research gain understand cellular inflammatory mechanism occur lung HIV-infected smoker transition conventional tobacco cigarettes e-cigarettes characterize effect substitute e-cigarettes withdrawal , crave neurocognition . These effort provide first kind data effect ECIGs study population . Background &amp; Significance : While rate cigarette smoke gradually decrease US , burden tobacco abuse among people live HIV remain undisputedly high prevalence estimate two three time higher general population ( 42.4 % vs. 17.8 % ) . Although ECIGs likely contain significantly few number toxicant compare combustible cigarette , unclear whether ECIG le harmful traditional tobacco counterpart reduce withdrawal , crave neurocognitive deficit precipitate relapse conventional cigarette . The biological effect ECIG lung health yet sufficiently characterize due relatively nascent nature field . While combustible tobacco use induces oxidant stress airways healthy smoker , little work date establish effect ECIG use oxidant stress human airway . Transitioning HIV-infected smoker combustible tobacco ECIG may decrease lung oxidative stress , improve lung function decrease withdrawal symptom deficit neurocognition commonly see tobacco withdrawal . Design &amp; Procedures : HIV-infected person recruit Duke Infectious Diseases Clinic . For pilot study , 15 willing subject receive ECIGs 5 control subject continue smoke choose usual brand combustible cigarette ( UB ) . Each group receive either ECIG UB total 4 week undergo pulmonary behavioral assessment period . In order facilitate participant ' successful transition ECIG , mobile contingency management ( mCM ) procedure ( discuss ) use provide monetary reinforcement biochemically verify abstinence combustible cigarette . Participants UB group also undergo mCM procedure , contingency differ . After 4 week , ECIG group allow transition back choose combustible cigarette product additional 2 week additional pulmonary behavioral assessment . All subject undergo three respiratory assessment Duke Clinical Research Unit ( DCRU ) . The first respiratory assessment occur study visit 1 ( V1 ) establish baseline measure lung function , oxidative stress , systemic inflammation . Pulmonary assessment repeat 4wks transition ECIG continue UB use ( V4 ) . A final respiratory assessment ( V5 ) occur 2 week stop ECIG 6 week continue UB use measure change relative baseline lung function , oxidative stress , inflammation . Neuro-cognitive behavioral visit occur respiratory visit well 2 week ECIG transition / continue UB use ( V3 ) . Selection Subjects : Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria provide .</detailed_description>
