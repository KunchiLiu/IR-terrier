	<brief_summary>This observational study child Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) eligible base CF gene type . One group call treatment group gene type ( homozygous F508del ) make clinically eligible CF care provider begin treatment new FDA approve CF drug call orkambi . For control group , child enrol similar CF gene type ( heterozygous F508del ) eligible prescribe orkambi . The two group follow four visit 3 4 year observe change lung . Methods measure change lung disease include : MRI non-FDA approve inhaled xenon gas take detailed image lung , Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFT ) , Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) , Baseline CT image lung order part usual clinical care . The first two visit do start clinical treatment orkambi minimum 28 day apart 18 month . The third visit schedule 3 month start orkambi fourth visit 18 month later . For control group , time visit similar treatment group visit may schedule around annual CF care visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This control observational longitudinal study design capture Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) modulator therapy naive Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) subject F508del ( +/+ ) mutation age FDA approve treatment window CFTR modulator orkambi ( ivacaftor/lumacaftor ) . These subject compare disease control . The treatment group observe twice ( least 28 day apart 18 month ) clinically start orkambi observed twice ( 3 month 18 month ) clinically start orkambi . This study take advantage timely development Ultrashort Echo Time Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( UTE MRI ) , Hyperpolarized Xenon ( 129Xe ) MRI , Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) , approval F508del CFTR-directed CF therapy child . The proposal : ) validate emerge biomarker ( UTE MRI ) within CF child independent genotype , ii ) define trajectory UTE MRI force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) change initiate orkambi therapy compare age-matched CF control , iii ) determine relationships regional structural abnormality ( UTE MRI ) regional ( 129Xe MRI ) global ( LCI ) functional measure ventilation . Results establish MRI sensitive lung image tool translatable CF center apply throughout lifespan CF patient . CF patient one two copy F508del CFTR mutation 6-12 year old undergo UTE MRI soon clinical computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , disease quantification use establish score system modality . Quantitative image data LCI compare spirometry ( gold standard CF lung disease ) clinical predictor disease progression . The F508del ( +/+ ) patient cohort differ genotypically control cohort ( F508del [ +/- ] ) . All patient F508del ( +/- ) cohort pancreatic insufficient also nonfunctional second allele ( Class I II mutation , candidate modulator therapy ) . These two cohort phenotypically indistinguishable without modulator treatment , therefore untreated cohort serve ideal age time-matched control group F508del ( +/+ ) subject clinically initiate orkambi . Disease trajectories two group , quantify change pulmonary UTE MRI , compare FEV1 . MRI analysis include quantitative reader-based `` Brody '' score whole lung , lung lobe , subcategories Brody score system ( particular bronchiectasis , bronchial wall thickening , mucus plug ) . The longitudinal study capture cohort schedule annual CF visit possible 4 year modification timeline treatment group base clinically schedule begin orkambi treatment . As FDA approve indication orkambi change , subject F508del ( +/+ ) cohort become candidate modulators prior 12th birthday . The FDA currently review approval Fall 2016 low prescribe age 6 year investigator enrol meet change time .</detailed_description>
