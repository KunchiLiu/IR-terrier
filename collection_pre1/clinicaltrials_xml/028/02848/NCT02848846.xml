	<brief_summary>The NEBIAS ( `` NEurocontrolled BIdirectional Artificial upper limb hand prosthesiS '' ) proposal aim develop clinically evaluate ( select amputee ) neuro-controlled upper limb prosthesis intuitively control felt amputee natural one . This possible mean novel neural interface able provide stable selective connection nervous system . This goal achieve combine microtechnology material science allow , one side , record motor-related signal govern action amputate hand/arm motion control mechanical prosthesis , provide sensory feedback tactile kinesthetic sensor neuromorphic stimulation adequate afferent pathway within residual limb . The NEBIAS proposal also aim finding 'language ' intrinsically linking central nervous system peripheral nerve signal order govern simple complex hand/fingers movement . To reach goal , variety technique explore brain nerve function assemble integrate ; include analysis electromagnetic brain nerve signal , well movement-related change brain 's blood flow/metabolism .</brief_summary>
