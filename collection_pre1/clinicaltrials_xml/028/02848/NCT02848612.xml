	<detailed_description>Since begin 2000s , reference treatment management aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage consist interventional neuroradiology coil embolization aneurysm . Although ensure good neurological prognosis neurosurgical clipping , interventional neuroradiology expose patient various risk : thromboembolic complication embolization re-rupture aneurysm embolization . To prevent thromboembolic complication , embolization procedure perform prophylactic unfractionated heparin , efficacy monitor point-of- care test accord international guideline . However , guideline base limited scientific evidence ideal level anticoagulation require precisely define . Furthermore , correlation point-of- care test use Amiens University Hospital reference method use laboratory varies considerably accord available literature .</detailed_description>
