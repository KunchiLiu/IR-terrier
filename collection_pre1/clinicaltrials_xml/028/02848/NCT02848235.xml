	<brief_summary>Kenya recently adopt new treatment guideline pregnant woman HIV , call woman initiate triple-drug antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) soon first visit antenatal care . As part new standard care prevent mother child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) , Kenya also establish Kenya Mentor Mother Program ( KMMP ) 2012 provide guidance standardize peer education psychosocial support service within national PMTCT program . This new standard care ( life-long ART KMMP ) yield significant improvement prevent mother child transmission woman accept triple-drug treatment pregnancy adhere visit schedule receive uninterrupted supply medication pregnancy least cessation breastfeeding . The primary objective study : ( 1 ) evaluate implementation new guideline Kenya actual , real-world condition major maternal child health clinic southern Rift Valley region Kenya ; ( 2 ) evaluate , also routine program condition , benefit innovative intervention package design improve implementation new treatment guideline . The intervention use exist Mentor Mothers , already part PMTCT program staff clinic . At end clinic visit , Mentor Mother review patient treatment plan schedule next visit . The Mentor Mother also offer , encounter , send text message reminder patient next clinic visit offer set automatic reminder directly patient 's cell phone . The intervention strategy develop close collaboration local health facility PMTCT program staff base prior on-going experience provide PMTCT service region , strategy potential dramatically improve PMTCT service delivery support global goal eliminate mother child transmission . The study take place 12 clinic south-rift valley region Kenya . A total 360 patient enrol study ( approximately 30 clinic ) . The investigator enrol patient receive permission look information record medical record . All patient eligible study , provide write consent , include study target number 360 obtain . After consent , study contact patient . Because study review information medical file clinic already collect part routine care , risk patient minimal . The possible risk accidental disclosure HIV status , study design minimize risk . There direct benefit study participant , study design understand exist adherence PMTCT care treatment improve adherence . The study expect start 2016 end 2019 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment guideline woman HIV pregnancy delivery resource-constrained setting change significantly WHO 2013 guideline , recommend pregnant woman HIV initiate triple-combination ART ( Option B ) . With guideline , woman previously eligible life-long ART initiation continue life , rest remain ART least duration breastfeeding . A related recommendation pregnant woman newly diagnose HIV initiate ART lifelong treatment . As 2014 , Kenyan Ministry Health ( MOH ) recommend Option B+ , include `` immediate initiation life-long ART pregnant breastfeed woman upon HIV diagnosis continuous adherence support '' regardless CD4 count . Throughout document , 2014 policy refer standard care ( SOC ) . Recognizing barrier pregnant woman newly diagnose HIV antenatal care would face refer elsewhere HIV care treatment , 2005 South Rift Valley PEPFAR program establish policy integrate HIV-related care include ART PMTCT service provide large MCH clinic within region . As 2013 , policy begin implemented 12 large facility program accounting 85 % woman newly diagnose HIV pregnancy region . As part standard care , Kenya also develop National Guidelines PMTCT Peer Education Psychosocial Support Kenya : The Kenya Mentor Mother Program ( KMMP ) . Mentor Mothers clinic staff member also woman live HIV . They train employed part clinic 's medical team provide pre-test group education session , one-on-one couple counsel , support group defaulter trace . As part routine clinic activity , Mentor Mothers obtain consent client various form follow , include full consent phone SMS follow ( phone follow , follow ) well consent home follow community health worker . Successful implementation PMTCT service require : ( 1 ) pregnant woman HIV initiate life-long ART minimal delay first ANC visit ( woman already ART continue ART ) ; ( 2 ) continue treatment delivery ; ( 3 ) continue treatment delivery cessation breastfeeding ( continue life health ) ; ( 4 ) child complete HIV test 6 , 36 , 72 week know uninfected cessation breast feeding . Kenya yet know new policy lead well PMTCT outcomes , much less much well , old policy . Information continue lack Kenya elsewhere ability PMTCT program initiate pregnant woman HIV ART pregnancy retain treatment along PMTCT cascade care delivery , cessation breastfeeding long term . This information largely lacking time period country implement prior PMTCT policy ( e.g. , Option A ) , information yet exist new policy Kenya . What information exist suggest significant room improvement . For example , recently publish study treatment program western Kenya , active outreach department , report 32 % woman initiate ART pregnancy disengage treatment delivery . Although data study 2006-2009 , indicate difficulty retain pregnant woman ART pregnancy . Information key outcome , proportion eligible actually initiate treatment report . Another study roughly region Kenya time period report 38 % woman newly diagnose HIV pregnancy register PMTCT program . In two hospital Kericho Nairobi ( Gigil Naivasha ) , 4 % woman eligible ART initiate treatment within six month HIV diagnosis . Some evidence suggest integration ART within MCH clinic improve linkage initiation treatment . For example , study Zambia find integration PMTCT include ART MCH service increase percentage woman initiate PMTCT care ( 44 % compare 25 % ) increase percentage eligible initiate treatment pregnancy ( 32 % compare 4 % ) . While integration improve upon basic outcome , majority patient still initiate PMTCT care initiate ART eligible . Early evidence implementation life-long ART pregnant woman Malawi suggest eliminate CD4 count eligibility criterion might facilitate initiation , significant share may still agree initiate ART , retention treatment delivery may remain problematic without specific attention direct towards issue . To support effective implementation Kenya PMTCT SOC South Rift Valley , region Kenya , resource limited setting , good up-to-date information remain need implementation currently provide study region . And recognize importance timely initiation retention treatment pregnancy , active strategy retain patient care preferable after-the-fact follow re-engage patient care previously disengage . Thus , feasible programmatic intervention support successfully implementation SOC long-term patient care beyond pregnancy . The study propose design fill information gap improve implementation Kenyan PMTCT SOC . The investigator evaluate impact cost innovative strategy improve implementation SOC . The strategy , call Enhanced Mentor Mother ProgrAm ( EMMA ) , provide specific structure use Mentor Mothers within PMTCT program . The EMMA strategy develop collaboration local health facility PMTCT program staff base experience provide PMTCT service within integrated ART-MCH facility . If successful , approach potential improve dramatically PMTCT service delivery support global goal eliminate mother child transmission . This enhancement exist Mentor Mother program consistent KMMP guideline , emphasize `` The National Guidelines intend remove space creativity innovation approach . On contrary , MOH hop inspire ongoing dialogue quality improvement clearly define start point outline herein '' .</detailed_description>
