	<brief_summary>Bile acid malabsorption ( BAM ) , common cause diarrhoea , affect 1 million people UK , often misdiagnosed irritable bowel syndrome go unrecognised patient inflammatory bowel disease . The SeHCAT ( seleno-tauro-homocholic acid ) test currently diagnostic test BAM , widely available also time consuming , expensive involves exposure radioactivity . Some clinician give course blind empirical treatment instead . The National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) recognise issue highlight need cheap safer test identify BAM . This study assess accuracy simple , convenient inexpensive laboratory test rapid diagnosis BAM measure bile acid stool . This test potential broad impact clinical practice patient care enable doctor identify treat patient BAM promptly . Results second phase study allow assessment benefit monitor stool test determine whether bile acid change predict response treatment dosage need patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Faecal Bile Acids Management Bile Acid Diarrhoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic diarrhoea 5 % population , third case bile acid malabsorption ( BAM ) . SeHCAT ( seleno-tauro-homocholic acid ) test gold standard BAM , involve ingestion seleno-tauro-homocholic acid , limit small number UK centre . NICE report although SeHCAT might benefit patient , need explore alternative technology . With limited access cost SeHCAT , many centre use empirical trial bile acid sequestrants , without diagnosis . This may effective many patient non-adherent . This pilot study evaluate cheap simpler laboratory test , quantitates faecal bile acid . This assay safer , easy use , potentially give rapid diagnosis BAM . The aim determine sensitivity specificity new assay . In longitudinal phase study , evaluate faecal bile acid follow bile salt sequestrant therapy , evaluate role dose titration . The following patient recruit ( ) post-cholecystectomy ; ( ii ) post-terminal ileal resection ; ( iii ) primary BAM . Patients SeHCAT test faecal bile acid concentration determine . Outcomes : The result faecal bile acid measurement patient compare SeHCAT determine sensitivity specificity . Longitudinal follow determine effect bile salt sequestration faecal bile acid . These result would inform design large study , allow evaluation new test NHS .</detailed_description>
