	<brief_summary>The current standard care ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) include use medicine call anti-arrhythmic drug ( AADs ) Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy . These treatment use terminate irregular heartbeat bring heart back normal rhythm . Catheter ablation procedure use eliminate ( damage ) heart cell cause arrhythmia . Patients eligible may benefit ablation procedure addition ICD treat VT condition risk develop VT . This study aim show treat VT catheter ablation , perform preemptively time ICD implantation , reduce subsequent recurrent VT , ICD shock , lead improve survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pan-Asia United States PrEvention Sudden Cardiac Death Catheter Ablation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enter randomized trial . Randomization 1:1 control group ablation group . Those randomized control group receive ICD therapy routine drug therapy ( include antiarrhythmic drug indicate ) . Subjects randomized ablation group receive ablation therapy plus ICD ventricular tachycardia . Patients refuse ICD therapy undergo ablation enrol prospective registry . Follow-up perform prior hospital discharge incision check device interrogation standard care . In addition , routine device clinical follow-up schedule 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Electrocardiography ( ECG ) perform pre-implant prior hospital discharge . Echocardiography ( TTE ) perform pre-implant 12 24 month . Patients refuse ICD implantation randomize approached inclusion registry undergo catheter ablation without ICD . Basic demographic medical history collect registry subject upon enrollment . Registry subject receive follow-up routine clinical care every 6 month check overall status . 120 subject randomize . An additional 60 subject enrol registry . As time protocol revision C change make ( 07Nov2016 ) , 33 subject randomize . There preliminary interim analysis data point . The study-sponsor access clinical follow-up patient enrolled date .</detailed_description>
