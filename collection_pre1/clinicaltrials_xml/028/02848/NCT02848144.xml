	<brief_summary>Infectious shock associate high mortality rate ( 20-40 % ) . Anti-inflammatory strategy base postulate mortality relate sepsis mainly due overwhelm pro-inflammatory immune response fail . Some patient survive initial phase develop immune dysfunction compensatory mechanisms become deleterious persist time . The persistence immunosuppression day 3 5 independently associate nosocomial infection high mortality rate . The clinical laboratory evidence sepsis induce immunosuppression recently review Hotchkiss et al . Apoptosis-induced depletion immune effector blood study septic patient show decreased production pro-inflammatory cytokine , decrease HLA-DR expression , increase percentage regulatory T cell , increase production program cell death ( PD ) -1 . Some small positive phase 2 trial biomarker guide immune enhance agent granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) interferon γ ( IFN γ ) report . There insufficient data show immunosuppression exist child . Only one study perform child organ dysfunction admit pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) , show 34 % developed immunosuppression . This study perform heterogeneous population immunological analysis limit . Therefore , crucial need study septic patient match control provide evidence paradigm exist child . The collaboration laboratories high level experience domain , clinical unit high potential recruitment child severe infectious shock allow u perform first prospective study specifically do child infectious shock . The main hypothesis child severe infectious shock develop sepsis-induced immunosuppression show adult . This assessed expression HLA-DR monocyte ' surface . We make hypothesis child become immunosuppressed prone develop secondary nosocomial infectious stay longer PICU hospital . Children age 1 month 17 year , admit PICU HFME Lyon-Bron eligible criterion severe sepsis septic shock , define `` Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012 '' Toxic Shock Syndrome ( TSS ) ( definition CDC - Center Disease Control ) . An information leaflet issue parent child / adolescent inform right object search . Are provided part research : - Immunological measure ( mHLA -DR ) three stage : first 48 hour , D3/5 D7/9 . The volume collect blood exceed 2.4 ml / kg . - The collection nosocomial infection status D30 A control group patient hospitalize surgery without sepsis toxic shock criterion recruit hospital ICU investigator match age . Similarly control give oral write information opportunity deny inclusion . They exams first group patient .</brief_summary>
