	<brief_title>Correlating Osteoarthritic Knee Microenvironment Clinical Outcome After Treatment With Regenexx®SD Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-center , laboratory blind include 200 subject knee osteoarthritis unilateral bilateral knee treat Regenexx® SD osteoarthritic knee/s.Initial study procedure include baseline evaluation medical history , knee history , knee examination , medication use , MRI , subject-reported outcome . Subjects enrol within 120 day prior Regenexx® SD injection . A preoperative visit occur time enrollment . Collection synovial fluid OA knee/s serve experimental condition , i.e . osteoarthritic knee.Each osteoarthritic subject undergo withdrawal knee joint synovial fluid knee treat ( 0.3-0.5 ml ) analyze research laboratory via multiplexed enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) dimethylmethylene blue assay ( DMMB ) pre-injection ( 2-8 day Regenexx® SD treatment ) post-injection ( 2-8 day Regenexx® SD ) . Documentation osteoarthritic joint characteristic injection procedure detail record throughout study . The unaffected knee joint undergo treatment , bilateral knee may treat . Components synovial fluid correlate post-treatment clinical outcome , include patient-reported questionnaire well assessment post-injection complication , adverse event , re-injections surgical intervention . Patient-reported clinical outcome comprise IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation , Lower Extremity Function Scale , Numeric Pain Scale Patient Reported Percent Improvement form .</detailed_description>
