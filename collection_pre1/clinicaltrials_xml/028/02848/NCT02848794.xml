	<brief_title>Apatinib Irinotecan Treating Patients With Recurrent High-grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gliomas account almost 80 % primary malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma common subtype . Despite treatment surgery , radiation , chemotherapy ( Temozolomide ) almost patient glioma experience recurrence median survival patient less 2 year . In recurrent disease , salvage therapy limit result minimal improvement OS . This overwhelming need improve treatment drive development novel drug target glioma biology , specifically anti-VEGF therapy . Malignant glioma consider among angiogenic cancer mostly fuel vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) signal via endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) . Levels VEGF receptor correlate histologic grade glioma , high level present glioblastoma.Thus glioblastoma emerged attractive tumor conduct clinical trial novel anti-VEGF agent , monoclonal antibody tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Bevacizumab recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody bind VEGF isoforms , cause reduce tumor vascularization inhibit tumor growth . In single-institute , phase II trial patient recurrent high-grade glioma , bevacizumab combination irinotecan demonstrate 46 % 6-month PFS 57 % OR rate . Following result study , another phase II trial conduct evaluate safety efficacy bevacizumab alone combination irinotecan , show promising result . On basis study , well study Kreisl colleague , FDA approve bevacizumab patient recurrent glioblastoma 2009 . Despite bevacizumab therapy , 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) relapse progressive high-grade glioma 30.8 % 50.3 % , median overall survival ( OS ) less 42 week . Thus , recurrent high-grade glioma remain largely unmet medical need , highlight need novel effective therapy . Apatinib small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) highly selectively bind strongly inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) . Apatinib demonstrate monotherapy prolongs OS patient gastric gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma two line chemotherapy moderate , reversible , easily manage adverse event . The study aim evaluate efficacy safety Apatinib Irinotecan patient recurrent high-grade glioma .</detailed_description>
