	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) consider main cause mortality western world . There many factor contribute onset progression cardiovascular disease , include hypertension . Hypertension multi-factorial condition include nutritional disorder causality line . It believe advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs ) one pathophysiological cause explain occurrence high blood pressure diabetic patient . This study role describe protocol randomize clinical trial aim evaluate change serum level end product advanced glycation intervention eat habit change hypertensive individual . The investigator design randomized clinical trial , non-blinded assessment outcome . Participants recruit outpatient clinic hypertension public hospital Porto Alegre , age 40 80 year old without diabetes . Hypertension define systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg , antihypertensive medication use . Participants assign one two group . The intervention group receive monthly educational intervention session low salt diet , high fruit vegetable , low process food period 6 month . Besides , intervention group receive standard telephone interview every two week motivate follow diet . The control group receive usual counseling low sodium diet monthly appointment dietitian , follow hypertension care clinic protocol . This study aim investigate significant change serum level advance glycation end product , nutritional intervention diet guidance fruit , vegetable , low sodium process food hypertensive patient several study show less processed food rich antioxidant low sodium content , play important role reducing level AGEs precursor vascular inflammation progression cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
