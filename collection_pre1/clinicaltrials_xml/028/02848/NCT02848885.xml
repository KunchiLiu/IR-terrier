	<brief_title>The Effects tDCS Illness Awareness Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial DCS novel , non-invasive non-convulsive technique alter brain function . To knowledge , research investigate functional behavioural effect tDCS anosognosia schizophrenia . As , aim improve impaired illness awareness schizophrenia tDCS inhibit leave hemisphere region ( i.e . temporoparietooccipital cortex ) show group activate illness denial . Positive result demonstrate impaired illness awareness schizophrenia involve similar brain network impair illness awareness patient brain lesion similarly modulate non-invasive technique , tDCS . If proven effective , easy administer , safe , non-invasive intervention would potential alter individual ' attitude towards illness medication , lead ultimately improvement individual ' capacity illness recognition treatment engagement , would undoubtedly significant impact management devastate mental disorder .</detailed_description>
