	<brief_summary>Myocardial perfusion major parameter characterize status capillary circulation myocardium . Its quantification possible use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) 1st pas contrast agent capillary system . This technique radiation-free , difficult repeat measurement single exam . Also , number patient suffer cardiac disease receive contrast agent injection . The investigator develop totally non-invasive approach quantify myocardial perfusion . It base magnetic label arterial spin . Flowing capillary ( Arterial spin labeling , ASL ) . Goal : The major goal research protocol validate totally non-invasive method myocardial blood flow quantification use MRI without contrast agent injection</brief_summary>
