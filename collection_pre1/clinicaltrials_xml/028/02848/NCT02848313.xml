	<criteria>For study , 1 eye eligible subject include designate study eye . However , specify ophthalmic testing perform eyes time point . A potential subject must meet follow criterion eligible inclusion study : Intermediate AMD noncentral GA disease group : 1 . Adults ≥ 55 year age 1 eye intermediate AMD noncentral GA. 2 . No evidence choroidal neovascularization ( active prior history ) study eye . 3 . Geographic atrophy may multifocal , cumulative GA lesion size must : 1 . ≥ 1.27 mm2 ( approximately ≥ 0.5 DA ) ≤ 10.16 mm2 ( approximately ≤ 4 DA ) . 2 . Must reside completely within FAF image field ( field 2 30degree image center fovea ) . 4 . Presence measurable hyperautofluorescence adjacent discrete focus GA. OR Intermediate AMD highrisk drusen without GA disease group : 5 . ≥ 55 year age one eye intermediate AMD highrisk drusen without GA. 6 . Highrisk drusen define presence either least 1 large ( ≥ 125 µm ) druse multiple mediumsize ( 63 124 µm ) drusen . General ( disease group ) : 7 . Able provide inform consent willing comply study visit examination . 8 . Women childbearing potential pregnant nursing negative serum pregnancy test screening . 9 . Bestcorrected visual acuity assess ETDRS letter ≥ 55 letter ( Snellen equivalent ≥ 20/70 ) . 10 . Lowluminance visual acuity deficit ( define difference BCVA LL visual acuity ) &gt; 5 letter . 11 . Has least two LowLuminance Questionnaire sub scale result , one abnormal subscales either general dim light vision dim light reading . 12 . The fellow eye may intermediate AMD without noncentral GA ( i.e. , highrisk drusen ) , intermediate AMD noncentral GA , NV AMD , central GA . Ongoing treatment antiangiogenic therapy fellow eye allowable . 13 . No evidence visually significant cataract OR pseudophakia without evidence posterior capsular opacity . 14 . Sufficiently clear ocular medium , adequate pupillary dilation , fixation permit quality fundus imaging , able cooperate sufficiently adequate ophthalmic visual function test anatomic assessment . 15 . Able administer SC study drug solution demonstrate screen able care provider appropriate designee administer study drug ( i.e. , capable family member home health nursing aide ) . 16 . If childbearing potential relationship partner childbearing potential , able abstain sex use acceptable contraception study 3 month dose . 1 . For men : Abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle subject . The subject also agree use acceptable method contraception become sexually active . Subjects must use condom spermicide date inform consent least 3 month last dose study drug . Periodic abstinence ( e.g.calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 2 . For woman : abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle subject . The subject agree use acceptable method contraception become sexually active . Maintenance monogamous relationship male partner surgically sterilize vasectomy ( vasectomy procedure must conduct least 60 day Screening visit confirm via sperm analysis ) , barrier method ( e.g. , condom occlusive cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream AND either hormonal contraception ( oral , implanted , injectable ) intrauterine device system acceptable method . 17 . Ability willingness undertake schedule visit assessment . A subject study eye meet follow criterion exclude study : Ocular condition study eye 1 . Agerelated macular degeneration evidence central GA ( i.e. , involve fovea ) . 2 . Atrophic retinal disease cause AMD . 3 . Presence diagnosis exudative AMD choroidal neovascularization study eye . 4 . History diabetic retinopathy ( history diabetes mellitus without retinopathy criterion exclusion ) . 5 . Presence vitreous hemorrhage . 6 . History retinal detachment macular hole ( stage 3 4 ) study eye . 7 . Presence macular pucker . 8 . History uncontrolled glaucoma , define advanced cuptodisc ratio &gt; 0.7 IOP &gt; 25 , without topical antihypertensive eye drop ; treatment ocular hypertension control glaucoma criterion exclusion . 9 . History advance guttae indicative Fuchs endothelial dystrophy . 10 . Presence visually significant cataract OR presence significant posterior capsular opacity set Pseudophakia . 11 . Presence significant keratopathy would cause scatter light alter visual function , especially LL condition . 12 . Ocular incisional surgery ( include cataract surgery ) study eye within 3 month ( i.e . 90 day ) Day 1 . 13 . Aphakia . 14 . History vitrectomy surgery , submacular surgery , vitreoretinal surgery . 15 . Prior treatment Visudyne ® ( verteporfin ) , externalbeam radiation therapy ( intraocular condition ) , transpupillary thermotherapy . 16 . History prophylactic subthreshold laser treatment retinal disease . 17 . Previous intravitreal drug delivery ( e.g. , intravitreal corticosteroid injection , antiangiogenic drug , device implantation ) study eye . Ocular condition either eye 18 . Active uveitis and/or vitritis ( grade trace ) either eye . 19 . History idiopathic autoimmuneassociated uveitis either eye . 20 . Active , infectious conjunctivitis , keratitis , scleritis , endophthalmitis either eye . Systemic condition 21 . Known immunocompromised receive systemic immunosuppression . 22 . Any disease medical condition opinion Investigator would prevent subject participate study might confound study result . 23 . Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/minute , MDRD . 24 . Presence history clinically significant allergy disease require treatment , judge Investigator . Hay fever allow unless active . General 25 .
