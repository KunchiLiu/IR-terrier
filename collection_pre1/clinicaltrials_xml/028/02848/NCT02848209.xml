	<detailed_description>Written inform consent obtain 9 random female Caucasian patient age 40 80 year receive Peeling assist volume enhance ( PAVE ) facelift procedure Ocean Clinic , Marbella Spain , take part histologic case control study within-subjects design . After complete facelift , subcutaneous undermined abundant pre-auricular skin side resect consequence lift anyhow study patient resect split completely half yield four sample size , two side , without contact order prevent interaction peel agent ( n=9 sample per treatment ) . One sample serf control , three sample treat different peel agent surgeon : Trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) peel concentration 20 % 40 % phenol/croton oil peel . The TCA sample peel immediately 2 4 minute even frost neutralize even frost point . The phenol/croton oil peel sample occlude silicone tape 24 hour neutralize . After 24 hour routine in-hospital stay patient , skin sample resect , preauricular wound close , sample place 10 % neutral buffer formalin . The sample immediately process , trim , embed , section stain haematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) researcher . Histological evaluation take place Tuebingen carry use microscope , picture capture 10x , 25x 100x magnification use digital camera . Two trained histological examiner blind study design independently perform histological evaluation . The depth necrosis µm determine analyse tissue damage relation histological skin layer . All slice evaluate use light microscopy assess mean depth necrosis three sample three different site specimen . The vertical height µm cutaneous basal membrane deep penetration tissue damage measure well total thickness epidermis dermis . Based histomorphological change , actual peeling depth determine classify analogously current classification burn : superficial , superficial-partial , deep-partial full thickness .</detailed_description>
