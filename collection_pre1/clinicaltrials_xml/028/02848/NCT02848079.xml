	<brief_title>TAS-OX Refractory Metastatic Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAS-102 oral agent , consist combination novel antimetabolite 5-trifluorothymidine ( FTD ) thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor ( TPI ) prevent degradation FTD . It demonstrate activity chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patient . In Japanese randomized phase II trial , TAS-102 improve medial overall survival compare placebo ( 9.0 vs.6.6 month , Hazard Ratio ( HR ) 0.56 ) patient mCRC refractory 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , irinotecan oxaliplatin . Subsequently , randomize phase III study conduct 13 country ( RECOURSE trial ) confirm benefit overall survival compare placebo ( 7.1 month vs. 5.3 month , HR 0.68 ) patient refractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) 5 . Oxaliplatin third generation platinum compound , active use together 5-FU treatment mCRC ( FOLFOX ) . FOLFOX chemotherapy , frequently combine anti-angiogenic agent Bevacizumab , widely accept preferred first-line regimen treatment disease US . Oxaliplatin also frequently reintroduce advanced setting . Reintroduction see progression maintenance therapy , resolution previous treatment limit neuropathy , disease recurrence post adjuvant treatment post metastasectomy . In control arm randomize study FOLFOX4 FOLFOX7 oxaliplatin stop-and-go fashion advance colorectal cancer ( OPTIMOX1 study ) , oxaliplatin reintroduce 27 % patient . Although patient derive clinical benefit oxaliplatin reintroduce , response rate robust initial exposure . Decreased efficacy may least part due prolonged exposure resultant resistance 5-FU , backbone maintenance oxaliplatin contain regimen . Hence , investigator propose explore safety efficacy oxaliplatin combination alternative anti-metabolite TAS-102 ( TAS-OX ) . TAS-102 demonstrated activity 5-FU refractory mCRC , investigator hypothesize TAS-OX may serve alternative drug combination patient progress recurred FOLFOX , candidate additional oxaliplatin therapy . This 2-part clinical trial TAS-102 combination oxaliplatin . The first part dose-finding run-in phase enroll 3-18 patient . The second part , focus study , single arm cohort , evaluate safety , well efficacy , TAS-OX treatment mCRC . The subject part 2 treated drug dos determine Part 1 trial . Up 50 patient enrol part 2 . Anticipated enrollment may high 68 patient . Maximum potential enrollment list anticipated enrollment , .</detailed_description>
