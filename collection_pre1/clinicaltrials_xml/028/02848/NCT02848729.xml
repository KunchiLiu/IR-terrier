	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Drug-Drug Interactions Between Morphine Orally IV Administered Acetaminophen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetaminophen significantly reduce use opioid analgesic use concomitantly treat moderate severe pain . The use IV acetaminophen use concomitantly opioids increase practice postsurgical pain relief orally administer acetaminophen provide immediate peak plasma concentration believe provide fast analgesic effect . Opioids use treat pain inhibit gastrointestinal motility , include delay gastric empty . In patient receive opioids absorption orally administer acetaminophen may delay could result gastric accumulation acetaminophen thereby markedly change pharmacokinetic profile . The opioid-induced inhibition gastrointestinal motility would expect affect IV acetaminophen pharmacokinetics . Thus coadministered IV acetaminophen opioid would yield good outcome efficacy reduce risk side effect compare coadministration oral acetaminophen opioids .</detailed_description>
