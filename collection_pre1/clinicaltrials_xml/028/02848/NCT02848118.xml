	<brief_title>Capnography Monitoring Bronchoscopic Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo flexible bronchoscopy ( FB ) experience procedure-related symptom . Current guideline FB recommend sedation patient undergo FB , except contraindication . Propofol benzodiazepines plus opioid common combination use improve patient tolerance satisfaction FB . However , controversy combine propofol opioids persists risk over-sedation cardiopulmonary depression . While transition alert sedation induction , like sleep , respiratory drive muscle tone respiratory muscle upper airway attenuate , contribute hypoventilation upper airway collapse , hypoxemia . Detection cardiopulmonary depression traditionally rely continuous monitor heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation . However , show monitor could recognize hypoventilation early . Similar publish data , around 40 % hypoxemia event occur FB sedation hospital . Further analysis data reveal around 15 % event occur sedative induction . Capnography noninvasive measurement partial pressure carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) airway ventilation . The maximum partial pressure CO2 obtain end exhale breath refer end-tidal CO2 ( EtCO2 ) . Studies reveal waveform analysis capnography provide early warning prehypoxic respiratory depression patient undergoing procedure sedation emergency department gastrointestinal endoscopy . Therefore , capnography serve real-time measure ventilatory status sedative patient physician could intervene occurrence hypoxemia . Based advantage non-invasive real-time property EtCO2 monitor capnography , investigator plan conduct clinical trial evaluate hypoxemia could reduce capnography EtCO2 monitor induction FB sedation .</detailed_description>
