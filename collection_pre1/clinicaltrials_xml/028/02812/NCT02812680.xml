	<detailed_description>Recently , different group discover miRNAs detect body fluid plasma , serum saliva . These cell-free miRNAs secrete cell different form . Levels circulate miRNAs ( circ miRNA ) , like tissue miRNA , closely related pathology could use diagnostic prognostic tool several pathology , include cancer . Furthermore , recent report show circ miRNAs release tumor cell ability transfer metastatic potential nonmetastatic cell . The detection analysis circulate miRNA represent new step towards non-invasive diagnostic screen early cancer detection . Circulating tumor cell also hold promise biological marker , assess noninvasively . As 90 % cancer death associate metastasis , crucial understand mechanism dissemination cancer cell . During past decade , multitude technique develop track characterize CTC . Clinical study various cancer reveal potential CTC prognostic predictive marker . The characterization CTC help design personalize treatment eradicate sub-clones primary tumour , give rise metastasis . Also , number CTC patient blood follow monitor efficacy neoadjuvant treatment . Most research esophageal cancer do squamous cell cancer dominant cell type worldwide . However , begin 1980s Esophageal Adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) increase frequency represent 80 % esophageal cancer North America Europe . There urgent need develop new technique diagnostic test combat EAC . By combine circ miRNA CTC , combine 2 promising clinical biomarkers , also able access new data complement tissue biopsy data . Furthermore , acquire blood sample various time point patient treatment , able create dynamic CTC circ miRNA profile .</detailed_description>
