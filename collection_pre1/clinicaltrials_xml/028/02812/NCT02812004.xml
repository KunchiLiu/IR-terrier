	<brief_summary>The Ultra Q Reflex® ( Ellex ) constitute Nd : YAG laser approve treatment vitreous floater . No randomized control clinical trial carry day order investigate superiority sham treatment . In present study , 60 eye randomize blind 2 group , one receive two session laser vitreolysis schedule two session sham treatment . After maximum two ( sham ) treatment session ( 1 per month ) , patient ' utility value score BCVA re-assessed . A follow-up period 12 month ( visit month 1 , 6 12 post-treatment ) ensue `` treatment phase '' register late adverse event may associate laser vitreolysis . As vitrectomy constitutes highly invasive procedure , must therefore restrict severe case , laser vitreolysis may present valuable treatment option patient moderate vitreous floater eligible vitrectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A great number patient seek ophthalmologist trouble vitreous floater . The majority patient reassure diagnosis make content get accustom `` mouches volantes '' . A considerable proportion , however , feel permanently irritate vitreous floater may result significant decrease patient ' quality life . Until recently , par plana vitrectomy constitute establish therapeutic option . Though standard surgical procedure , potential adverse event associate vitrectomy negligible patient must allow extended period visual rehabilitation . Therefore , treatment restrict severe case thus small percentage patient receive treatment . Reports exist Q-switched Nd : YAG laser surgery vitreous opacity , membrane vitreoretinal band 59 eye . The result early laser vitreolysis sober improve visual acuity 18 eye considerable adverse event retinal hole detachment ( 1 eye ) , minor retinal hemorrhage ( 4 eye ) focal opacity crystalline lens ( 5 eye ) . According another study , Q-switched system allow treatment wider variety indication posterior pole require few session compare mode-locked system . Due high energy level require Q-switch system , however , complication occur frequently . An additional study present favorable result ; 15 case symptoms vitreous floater disappear treatment adverse event report follow-up period least 1 year . Nevertheless , report energy level ( 5-7.1mJ total energy 71-742mJ ) considerable . Further result suggest laser vitreolysis moderately improve symptom 38 % patient , 61,5 % registered improvement ; adverse event report . In contrast , vitrectomy result full resolution symptom 93,3 % eye - one patient suffer post-operative retinal detachment . A recent study present 3 case chronic open-angle glaucoma secondary ND : YAG vitreolysis ( 3 eye 2 patient ) . The latency period vitreolysis onset elevate IOP range 1 week 8 month ; potential factor promote rise IOP , namely `` inflammation , steroid use , identifiable cause '' report absent . In two eye , SLT follow glaucoma surgery ( Trabectome ) require stabilise IOP . Whereas treatment floater locate anterior vitreous result obvious change , treatment mid-vitreous posterior vitreous lead increase protein , refractive index viscosity vitreous humor . It appear current literature remain inconclusive efficacy safety Nd : YAG vitreolysis . In review literature , floater vitrectomy - especially small sutureless gauge instrument corevitrectomy - yield excellent success rate combine low risk profile . In contrast , efficacy vitreolysis range 0 100 % . The key factor success vitreolysis use appropriately high energy level application sufficient amount shot . In retrospective , observational study ( include 168 eye , treatment Ultra Q Relfex® ) 92 % patient satisfied result ; In present study , vitreolysis perform Ultra Q Reflex® laser - day laser officially approve vitreolysis . It feature ultra-Gaussian beam mode , team fast-pulse rise time small-spot size . Due tightly control plasma high power density few shot require result lower cumulative dose . Moreover , co-axial alignment practitioner 's vision , target illumination , treatment beam grant good illumination vitreous opacity thus allow precise focusing . This patented design facilitate vaporization floater minimize risk collateral damage adjacent tissue .</detailed_description>
