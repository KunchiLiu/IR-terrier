	<brief_title>Nivolumab Combination With Plinabulin Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plinabulin microtubule destabilize agent ( MDA ) inhibit polymerization tubulin monomer resultant vascular disrupting property . Plinabulin inhibit tumor growth target angiogenesis tumor vasculature well directly induce apoptosis via Ras-JNK pathway . It also may activate anti-tumor immunity via induce maturation dendritic cell ( DC ) trigger release pro-inflammatory cytokine . Plinabulin could therefore synergic anti-tumor effect combine immune-checkpoint inhibitor . This hypothesis confirm murine model bear subcutaneous MC38 colon cancer use MDAs , include ansamitocin P3 , induce DC maturation similar plinabulin . Plinabulin test randomized phase 2 trial combination docetaxel show similar response rate docetaxel alone , significantly long duration response . Nivolumab inhibitor program cell death receptor-1 checkpoint pathway ( PD-1 ) superior activity NSCLC , regardless tumor histology , compare standard care . In study , plan combine nivolumab escalating dos plinabulin determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination . An expansion cohort enrol RP2D ass toxicity evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity . This single-center , phase 1 dose find trial plinabulin , combine FDA approve dose nivolumab , use 3+3 design patient metastatic NSCLC progress chemotherapy , include platinum-containing regimen . Patients receive plinabulin escalate dos combination nivolumab . Doses plinabulin nivolumab administer intravenous infusion 4-week cycle . Patients receive medication Days 1 15 additional dose plinabulin Day 8 . Plinabulin administer 60 minute completion nivolumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects histologically cytologicallyconfirmed metastatic NSCLC whose disease progress during/after treatment least one platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen . At least 1 3 prior systemic therapy metastatic disease . Adjuvant chemotherapy concurrent chemoradiation early stage disease count prior therapy unless patient progress within 6 month completion chemotherapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤1 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week Must least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Adequate hematopoietic , electrolyte , hepatic , renal laboratory finding . Prior chemotherapy must complete least 4 week least 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) study drug administration , adverse event either return baseline stabilize Prior treat brain metastasis allow . However , prior treat brain metastasis must without MRI evidence progression least 4 week systemic steroid least 2 week study drug administration Prior definitive radiation therapy must complete least 4 week study drug administration . Prior palliative radiotherapy complete least 2 week study drug administration . Whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) , stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) focal radiation site pain bronchial obstruction consider palliative . No radiopharmaceutical ( strontium , samarium ) within 8 week study drug administration Prior major surgery must complete least 4 week study drug administration . Prior minor surgery must complete least 1 week study drug administration subject recover . Percutaneous biopsy complete least 10 day prior study drug administration ; A negative serum pregnancy test screen woman childbearing potential . History grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody Subjects history cardiovascular illness . Uncontrolled hypertension , SBP &gt; 160 DBP &gt; 100 Symptomatic untreated brain metastasis Presence leptomeningeal disease Pulmonary condition , PI 's opinion would increase risk immunotherapyrelated pulmonary toxicity . Has active , noninfectious pneumonitis Presence second malignancy , exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer unless remission 3 year Subjects active , know , suspect autoimmune disease . History ileus significant gastrointestinal disorder know predispose ileus chronic bowel hypomotility . Prior therapy microtubule destabilize agent NSCLC ( ie . Vinorelbine ) Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( antibody target T cell costimulation pathway ) ; Known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ; Active infection require therapy , positive test Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) Underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation toxicity determination adverse event Concurrent medical condition require use immunosuppressive medication , systemic steroid . Use investigational drug within 28 day least 5 halflives study drug administration Pregnant nursing</criteria>
