	<brief_summary>Melasma acquire form hyperpigmentation see commonly face , characterize symmetrically distribute brown patch variable darkness . The cosmetically unattractive nature disorder show negatively affect patient 's quality life . Unfortunately , treatment melasma challenge often disappointing . Treatment include combination approach strict sun protection , cosmetic camouflage , topical lightening agent , laser therapy , chemical peel . Today , investigator define chemical peeling application chemical exfoliate agent skin , result destruction one part epidermis and/or dermis subsequent regrowth layer . Chemical peel divide superficial ( light ) , medium , deep ; superficial peel focus study . Superficial peel penetrate epidermis , safe , widely available well-tolerated treatment modality . These peel agent include glycolic acid , lactic acid , mandelic acid , salicylic acid trichloroacetic acid , unique property . For instance , alpha-hydroxy acid , glycolic acid , know hydrophilic , whereas salicylic acid lipophilic anti-inflammatory . As peel agent unique property , hypothesize combine use agent may result good clinical outcome use agent alone . Prior study demonstrate combined use peel safe effective improve variety skin condition include acne scar , hyperpigmentation , infraorbital dark circle . Overall however , study combine use chemical peel treatment melasma lack . Therefore , aim pilot study conduct control comparison efficacy safety combination peel ( glycolic acid salicylic acid ) compare glycolic acid peel alone treatment melasma .</brief_summary>
