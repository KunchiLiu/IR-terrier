	<brief_summary>The hypothesis propose study individualized assessment direct treatment algorithm identifies elderly patient , benefit combine nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine therapy . The project use CGA , include various test score system , stratify patient `` GO-GO '' , `` SLOW-GO '' `` FRAIL '' patient . Depending test result patient receive chemotherapy ( GO-GO group : nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine ; SLOW-GO group : gemcitabine monotherapy ) best supportive care ( FRAIL group ) . After first cycle chemotherapy ( 4 week ) subsequent CGA safety assessment perform assign patient definite treatment arm . The primary objective CGA-stratified patient decline CGA performance response chemotherapy measure loss five point less Barthel ` ADL ( ADL1 vs. ADL2 core CGA assessment ) .</brief_summary>
