	<brief_summary>After complete 600 interviews parent , adolescent , clinician determine reason HPV vaccine use use , investigator recently pilot communication-based educational intervention healthcare clinician improve communication around HPV vaccination . The intervention combine education quality improvement method use mechanism call Performance Improvement Continuing Medical Education . This type intervention attractive clinician improve cancer prevention practice fulfil requirement maintain board certification . The intervention consist seven education feedback session along baseline follow-up chart review facilitate group discussion clinician practice vaccination rate . The pilot intervention effective : two pilot intervention site , girl 60 % boys 15 time likely receive HPV vaccination control sit intervention period . The goal propose research broadly test intervention 's effectiveness diverse group pediatric family medicine practice serve low-income minority patient . First , investigator perform randomize trial five community health center determine effectiveness intervention . Second , investigator examine make intervention successful identify barrier sustainability goal ensure intervention successfully replicate setting . Third , investigator explore effect intervention parent-clinician communication survey parent clinician observe clinical encounter vaccination discuss . The propose intervention represent innovative scalable model promote cancer prevention screen activity clinician . Unlike program increase administrative burden busy clinician , propose intervention allow clinician improve cancer prevention practice simultaneously fulfil requirement maintain board certification improve quality cancer prevention care .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) cause cervical , vaginal , vulvar , anal , oral cancer , disproportionately affect low-income minority population . Universal HPV vaccination potential decrease burden reduce disparity disease . However , HPV vaccination rate U.S. adolescent remain low . Clinician recommendation important factor influence HPV vaccine uptake ; thus enhance clinician communication HPV vaccine critically important target intervention prevent cancer . OBJECTIVE In past six year , investigator ' research identify factor affect HPV vaccine communication utilization . investigator recently pilot communication intervention clinician , two pilot intervention site , girl 60 % boys 15 time likely receive HPV vaccination control sit intervention period . The investigator aim demonstrate effectiveness intervention randomize trial , directly examine effect communication . SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1 . To evaluate intervention effectiveness raise HPV vaccination rate use step wedge randomize trial federally qualify health center . Aim 2 : To conduct process evaluation examine barrier facilitator intervention implementation intervention sustainability , assess intervention fidelity . Aim 3 . To describe specific effect intervention clinician-parent communication HPV vaccination . STUDY DESIGN To address Aim 1 , investigator perform step wedge randomize trial five community health center determine effectiveness intervention . The intervention consist seven session Performance Improvement Continuing Medical Education ( PI CME ) program employ HPV education train motivational interviewing improve clinician ' HPV vaccine communication , allow clinician improve quality vaccine care fulfil board certification requirement . To address Aim 2 , investigator individually interview select group provider clinical leader use Promoting Action Research Implementation Health Services ( PARiHS ) model process evaluation , analyze audio recording clinical interaction measure intervention fidelity . Aim 3 , exploration intervention 's effect parent-clinician communication , conduct survey parent clinician observe clinical encounter . CANCER RELEVANCE Rates HPV related cancer increase , vaccination rate remain stagnant since 2011 . Recognizing potential impact HPV vaccination , President 's Cancer Panel state 2014 raise HPV vaccination rate national priority . The propose intervention represent innovative scalable model promote cancer prevention screen activity clinician .</detailed_description>
