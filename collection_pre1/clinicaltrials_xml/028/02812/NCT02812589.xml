	<brief_summary>The breast MRI use preoperative scenario evaluate extension newly diagnose breast cancer screen contralateral breast . The scan consist series image take use intravascular contrast medium may detect area enhancement look malignant , actually benign tissue , produce false positive result . The investigator aim evaluate novel MRI sequence image use contrast , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Addition DTI sequence add significantly time standard breast MRI exam . This novel technique provide improved detection tissue microstructure able differentiate malignant benign tumor . Hence , investigator hypothesize DTI may decrease false positive rate compare standard dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) MRI .</brief_summary>
