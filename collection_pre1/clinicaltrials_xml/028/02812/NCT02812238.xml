	<brief_summary>Background : The immune system control body respond infection injury . Researchers want see effect dietary supplement call nicotinamide riboside ( NR ) immune system . A study show fast good effect immune cell health healthy people . And immune cell expose NR similar positive response fasting . Researchers want see healthy people effect NR fasting , effect last . Objectives : To see take nicotinamide riboside healthy immune system effect fast . To see good effect continue even eat . Eligibility : Healthy volunteer age 18 39 Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Women urine pregnancy test . Participants take 4 pill either NR placebo day 1 week . On day 6 , eat drink anything . On day 7 , study visit give blood sample eat meal clinic . They also give urine sample . Participants stop take pill 1 2 week . Participants take either NR placebo day 1 week . They repeat day 6 day 7 first week . Participants get NR placebo , know take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intermittent caloric restriction fast numerous health effect include reduction numerous cardiovascular disease risk factor . The cellular program activate caloric restriction similarly turn preclinical study response 24-hour fast . We find beneficial effect 24-hour fasting blunts activation component immune system , term Nod-like receptor family protein 3 ( NLRP3 ) Inflammasome . This inflammasome , mediator sterile inflammation , associate development diabetes atherosclerosis . At time , find refeeding 24-hour fast significantly increase NLRP3 protein level , IL-1Beta , TNF signal , fast blunt NLRP3 inflammasome response , association activation fast sense protein call SIRT3 . Interestingly , recently discover naturally occur form vitamin B3 , call nicotinamide riboside ( NR ) , find activate SIRT3 . We find NR reproduces NLRP3 inflammasome blunt effect fasting administer primary human monocytes/macrophages culture . Putting together , would interest evaluate whether administration NR human subject would replicate fast blunt effect NLRP3 inflammasome . Interestingly , time , recently find , preclinical study , NLRP3 protein orchestrate differentiation naive T- cell Th2 cell . We therefore propose broadly examine effect NR administration myeloid lymphoid cell biology healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
