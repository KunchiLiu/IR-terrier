	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - Phase I : To evaluate safety tolerability isatuximab Japanese patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . - Phase II : To evaluate efficacy isatuximab recommend dose evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) isatuximab Japanese patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety include immunogenicity isatuximab . The severity , frequency incidence adverse event assess . - To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile isatuximab propose dose schedule . - To assess efficacy use International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) uniform response criterion . - To assess relationship baseline CD38 receptor density multiple myeloma cell efficacy .</brief_summary>
