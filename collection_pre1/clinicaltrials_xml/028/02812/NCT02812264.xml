	<brief_title>Using API Commercialize Evidence-Based Weight Loss Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test weight loss app use API disseminate evidence-based weight loss intervention . The investigator hypothesize , course 12 month , participant use Leaner app lose weight attention control group . Participants ( n=206 ) randomly assign use either intervention app ( intervention arm ; n=103 ) weight loss app choosing ( attention control arm ; n=103 ) 12 month . Assessments take place baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Statistical analysis : A linear mixed model approach use test hypothesis . Observed weight vs. time plot analyze participant discern general trend weight change . The model include intervention effect , time effect , intervention time interaction , random intercept . In exploratory analysis , investigator examine weight change across subgroups interest ; investigator add subgroup variable interaction intervention indicator primary model . All analysis evaluate 0.05 significance level .</detailed_description>
