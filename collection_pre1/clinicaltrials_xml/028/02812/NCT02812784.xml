	<brief_summary>Patients septic shock intensive care unit elevate risk develop acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . AKI independent factor mortality . Interventions limit worsen renal function might impact mortality rate patient . Given absence validate pharmacological treatment limit progression AKI accelerate recovery AKI , early intervention restoration glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) context hemodynamic change initial phase septic shock might improve patient ' prognosis . One major challenge therefore determine whether AKI reversible . The best-studied biomarkers ( NGAL KIM 1 ) little discriminant power septic patient poor specificity unsuitable kinetics early diagnosis . The combination urine assay tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 2 ( TIMP2 ) insulin-like growth factor bind protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) show good diagnostic performance early detection risk develop AKI follow 12 hr . Urine level two marker specifically reflect damage kidney tubule . Moreover , level appear strongly correlate severity tubule damage . Thus , one reasonably hypothesize measurement marker early stage septic shock might determine presence severity kidney tubule damage . A threshold ( yet define ) would help differentiate ( ) transient , non-severe injury ( ii ) injury already severe reversible .</brief_summary>
