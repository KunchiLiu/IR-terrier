	<brief_title>Pre-Surgical Study Evaluating Anti-PD-L1 Antibody ( Durvalumab ) Plus Anti-CTLA-4 ( Tremelimumab ) Patients With Muscle-Invasive , High-Risk Urothelial Carcinoma Who Are Ineligible Cisplatin-Based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive durvalumab tremelimumab vein Day 1 Weeks 1 5 . Each study drug infusion last 1 hour . Participant receive tremelimumab first participant receive durvalumab 1 hour later . Study Visits : During Day 1 Weeks 1 5 : - Participant physical exam . - Participant 's vital sign measure within 30 minute , every 15 minute participant receive study drug , 3 time 1 hour end participant 's dose durvalumab . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood also use test hepatitis A , B , C. This blood urine collection also include pregnancy test participant become pregnant . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw immune system test thyroid function test . - Participant cystoscopy check status disease . If doctor think need , participant may need surgery remove tumor . If participant need surgery disease get worse quickly , participant may take study . During Week 9 11 : - Participant physical exam , include measurement participant 's vital sign . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood also use test hepatitis A , B , C. - Participant EKG . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw immune system test . During Week 9 11 , participant surgery remove part participant 's bladder . Participant sign separate consent explain surgery risk . If screen participant tell participant eligible surgery Week 9 11 , participant biopsy participant 's last dose study drug . After Surgery ( Weeks 15-17 ) : - Participant physical exam , include measurement participant 's vital sign . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood also use test hepatitis A , B , C. - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw immune system test . Length Study : Participant study Week 17 visit . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up visit . Follow-up Visits : - About 90 day last dose study drug , participant ask side effect participant . - Every 3 month total 1 year start study , participant call ask participant . This phone call last 15 minute . This investigational study . Tremelimumab durvalumab FDA commercially available treatment bladder cancer . The use drug consider investigational . Up 15 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; /= 18 year time screen . In general , urothelial cancer occur 6th 8th decade life , unlikely pediatric patient include . 2 . Patients must tissue resected transurethral resection bladder tissue ( TURBT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center . 3 . Patients must histologic proof urothelial cancer . This include bladder cancer , addition tumor urothelial line include renal pelvis , ureteral , urethral cancer . Upper tract urothelial carcinoma also include . This group may include patient require cystectomy , include muscle invasive disease ( cT23aN0M0 ) , whose tumor could completely remove transurethral resection . 4. continue 3 ) Patients follow highrisk feature candidate traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy include trial : micropapillary , sarcomatoid plasmacytoid feature ; 3D mass exam anesthesia ( EUA ) ; lymphovascular continue 3 ) invasion ; hydronephrosis ( unless opinion treat physician , due tumor ) ; high grade ( grade 3 ) tumor ureter , renal pelvis , tumor area radiographic abnormality large enough recognize abnormal mass CT MRI imaging ; direct invasion prostatic stroma vaginal wall ( i.e . cT4a disease ) . Patients candidate refuse conventional chemotherapy may consider eligible . For patient eligibility unclear , final arbitration determine Principal Investigator . 5 . Subjects must prior exposure immunotherapy , , limited antiCTLA4 , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 antibody exclude vaccine 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 7 . Able willing give valid write consent available archival tumor sample fresh tumor biopsies/resections . 8 . Adequate organ marrow function ( subject must receive transfusion growth factor support within 28 day prior first dose ) , define : a. Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9 g/dL b .

Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method contraception time screening , must agree continue use precaution 180 day final dose investigational product . Cessation contraception point discuss responsible physician . Periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception . They must also refrain egg cell donation 180 day final dose investigational product . 10 . Nonsterilized male sexually active female partner childbearing potential must agree use highly effective method contraception Day 1 90 day receipt final dose investigational product . In addition , must refrain sperm donation 90 day final dose investigational product 1 . Concurrent enrollment another clinical trial , unless followup period observational study . 2 . Any concurrent chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic , hormonal therapy cancer treatment . Concurrent use hormone noncancerrelated condition ( e.g . insulin diabetes hormone replacement therapy ) acceptable . 3 . Any investigational anticancer therapy receive within 28 day prior first dose durvalumab tremelimumab . 4 . Major surgical procedure ( define PI coPIs within 28 day prior first dose durvalumab tremelimumab still recover prior surgery . 5 . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy , define resolve NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 1 exception alopecia laboratory value list per inclusion criterion . Subjects irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated durvalumab tremelimumab may include ( e.g . hearing loss ) consultation Principal Investigator . 6 . Known suspected autoimmune disease . Patients history inflammatory bowel disease ( include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] exclude study . Patients history Hashimoto 's thyroiditis require hormone replacement , Type I diabetes , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger allow participate .
