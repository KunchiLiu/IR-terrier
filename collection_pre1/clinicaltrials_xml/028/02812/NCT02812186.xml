	<brief_summary>This two period cross-over study randomize patient undergo laparoscopic surgery 2 different group : group 1 patient receive `` deep neuromuscular blockade '' begin portion laparoscopic surgery follow period `` moderate blockade '' , group 2 patient receive `` moderate neuromuscular blockade '' begin portion laparoscopic surgery follow period `` deep blockade '' . The deep neuromuscular block define post tetanic count 1 2 moderate neuromuscular block define 1-2 twitch . In patient , sugammadex use reverse block end surgery order obtain optimal extubating condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Versus Moderate Neuromuscular Blockade During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) frequently utilized laparoscopic procedure improve surgical condition relax abdominal muscle thus facilitate insufflation carbon dioxide optimize surgical view . Increased airway pressure lead increase alveolar perivascular edema , decline dynamic lung compliance hypoxemia . Several study investigate surgical view deep vs. moderate neuromuscular blockade . Literature support deep neuromuscular blockade provide well operate conditions/view surgeon low airway pressure , potentially , long duration extubation bad respiratory mechanic end anesthesia versus moderate neuromuscular blockade show worse operate conditions/view surgeon bad airway pressure possibly short duration extubation well respiratory mechanic end anesthesia . Thus , clearly equipoise regard comparative effectiveness deep v medium NMB . Therefore , study design ascertain deep neuromuscular block decrease airway pressure patient undergo laparoscopic procedure compare moderate block . A reduction airway pressure may lead decrease complication associate elevate airway pressure include hypoxemia , total static lung compliance , alveolar edema , long term morbidity . Additionally , study aim determine time administration sugammadex reversal different patient moderate NMB compare deep NMB .</detailed_description>
