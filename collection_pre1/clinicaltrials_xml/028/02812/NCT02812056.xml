	<brief_title>Alisertib TAK-228 Participants With Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) Associated Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign dose level base join study . Up 5 dose level alisertib TAK-228 test . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose alisertib TAK-228 found . Up 14 participant enrol onto Dose Expansion group high tolerable dose combination find . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 21 day . On Days 1-7 cycle , participant take alisertib mouth 2 time day glass water ( 4 ounce ) . On Days 3-18 cycle , participant take TAK-228 mouth 1 time day Participant eat drink anything 2 hour 1 hour take TAK-228 . Study Visits : Participant need take blood sugar level every morning study . Participant give blood sugar monitor study staff show use . Participant also blood sugar test clinic Participant must fast least 8 hour blood sugar test . If doctor think participant 's best interest , test may decrease 1 time week first 2 month . During Week 1 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test blood clotting , participant 's blood fat level , blood sugar level . - Urine collect routine test On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 , EKG . One ( 1 ) time Weeks 2 3 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test test participant 's blood sugar . One ( 1 ) time week Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Week 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Urine collect routine test . During Week 1 Cycle 3 beyond , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test test blood clotting , participant 's blood fat level , blood sugar level . During Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 every 3 cycle , participant CT , MRI , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long benefit . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , doctor think best interest , study stop , need treatment allow study , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study end-of-study visit . End Study Visit : Within 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant EKG check heart function . - Participant physical exam . - Urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test blood clotting , participant 's blood fat level , blood sugar level . - Participant CT , MRI , PET scan check status disease . This investigational study . Alisertib TAK-228 FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 44 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
