	<brief_summary>Hypothermia surgery postoperative period associate adverse outcome include impaired drug metabolism , cardiac morbidity , shiver , impaired immune function , coagulopathy , increase use hospital resource . Several clinical study demonstrate maintenance normothermia perioperative period significantly reduce morbidity . Mercury Biomed develop patient-warming system , WarmSmart , potentially transfer adequate heat hand foot base physiological principle peripheral arterio-venous shunt vaso-dilation . The technology work two-step process selective thermal stimulation along spinal cord up-regulate blood flow arterio-venous shunt trigger arterio-venous shunt vasodilation apply circulate water heat exchanger palmar plantar glabrous skin warm highly perfused shunt area . General anesthesia reduce vasoconstriction threshold ( trigger core temperature ) 1-2°C , thus promote arteriovenous shunt dilation . It remain unknown , though , whether cervical spine warm augments arterio-venous shunt dilation general anesthesia . If spine heat prof unnecessary anesthesia , Mercury Biomed 's WarmSmart warming could simpler less expensive . Investigators therefore propose test hypothesis cutaneous heating near cervical spine augment arterio-venous flow finger general anesthesia . Investigators propose enroll ten patient . The patient pre-warmed warm intraoperatively forced-air maintain core temperature near 36°C . A ThermaZone® Device capable heat cervical spine area position behind patient 's neck upon arrival operating room . Additionally forced-air warmer position appropriately activate soon practical , usually prepping drape . Ambient temperature maintain near 20°C . After one hour anesthesia temperature factor stable , investigator start 30-minute observation period . Thereafter investigator activate cervical spine warm system 30 minute ( warm measurement period ) thereafter 30 minute control period . Measurements record mean-skin temperature , distal esophageal temperature , MAC fraction , mean-arterial pressure finger blood flow .</brief_summary>
