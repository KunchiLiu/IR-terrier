	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect well pembrolizumab imatinib mesylate work treat patient melanoma c-KIT mutation amplification spread nearby tissue place body . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pembrolizumab imatinib mesylate may work well treat patient melanoma c-KIT mutation amplification spread nearby tissue place body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Imatinib Patients With Locally Advanced/Metastatic Melanoma With c-KIT Mutation/Amplification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess best overall response rate ( BORR = complete response + partial response ) combination pembrolizumab imatinib treatment melanoma harbor c-Kit mutation amplification . II . To evaluate safety adverse effect profile combination pembrolizumab imatinib patient melanomas harbor c-KIT aberration ( mutation amplification ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess median time progression ( TTP ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Assessment program cell death ligand ( PD-L ) 1 expression melanoma patient c-KIT aberration combine therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 imatinib mesylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 9 week 1 year , every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
