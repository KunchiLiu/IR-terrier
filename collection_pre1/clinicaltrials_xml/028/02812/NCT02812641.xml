	<brief_summary>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) one ten lead cancer Taiwanese male . The prognosis poor five-year overall survival rate 10 30 % . Randomized clinical trial demonstrate trimodality therapy ( TMT ) , consist neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation ( CCRT ) radical esophagectomy , improve overall survival patient locally advanced disease . Despite advancement , outcome remain unsatisfactory median progression-free survival around 20 25 month median overall survival around 30 month . It know important prognostic factor whether pathological complete response achieve neoadjuvant CCRT . However , use new generation chemotherapeutic agent taxanes epidermal growth factor inhibitor ( Cetuximab ) fail significantly improve prognosis compare standard platinum-fluorouracil ( PF ) regimen . As consequence , mandatory develop new chemotherapeutic regimen CCRT . In previous prospective study , investigator use proximal ligation assay technology identify serum VEGF-A correlation pathological response prognosis patient receive neoadjuvant CCRT plus radical esophagectomy locally advance ESCC . Other investigator also show high VEGF expression correlate poor outcome . Therefore , investigator generate hypothesis add vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) monoclonal antibody , Bevacizumab , standard neoadjuvant CCRT may improve outcome patient ESCC . Meanwhile , several prospective clinical study show feasibility , safety , activity add Bevacizumab chemotherapy , CCRT , combine modality therapy include surgery , either head neck cancer , esophageal cancer , esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma . However , efficacy investigate large prospective trial little known activity toxicity Bevacizumab ESCC due small number report case . In present clinical trial , investigator plan investigate whether incorporation Bevacizumab standard neoadjuvant PF-CCRT improve treatment response increase pathological complete response rate . Investigators also evaluate associated biomarkers relation prognosis . By present research , investigator expect develop new TMT regimen poor prognostic disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant CCRT With/Without Bevacizumab Locally Advanced ESCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize trial compare outcomes patient receive neoadjuvant PF-CCRT plus Bevacizumab ( BPF-CCRT ) PF-CCRT alone . Investigators design enrol 6 patient run-in phase , 44 patient randomized phase ( 22 patient group ) develop preliminary evidence use Bevacizumab ESCC .</detailed_description>
