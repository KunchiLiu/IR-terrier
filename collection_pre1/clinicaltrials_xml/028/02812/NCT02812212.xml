	<brief_title>CTT Renogram Early Marker Significant Obstruction Uretero-pelvic Junction Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antenatal hydronephrosis ( ANH ) uropathy characterize dilatation renal collecting system . It common abnormality find prenatal ultrasound examination ( 1-5 % pregnancy ) . Though majority case transient `` functional '' ultimately resolve birth , case pathological origin ureteropelvic junction obstruction ( UPJO ) common ( 7-35 % case ) . An increase understanding natural history ANH accompany change management systematic surgical approach active surveillance selective surgery . The main challenge differentiate reversible ANH pathological UPJO . Pathological obstruction generally result impairment urine flow , leave untreated , result renal damage abnormal development kidney . It therefore paediatric urologist determine whether obstruction significant irreversible damage occurs . However , without reliable prognostic criterion identify date , controversy still exist regard indication optimal time surgical management UPJO . Diuretic renography currently widely use diagnostic modality evaluate renal function obstruction . It confirm significant obstruction demonstrate alteration renal function , wait significant potentially irreversible loss function able confirm surgical indication unsatisfactory . For many author increase hydronephrosis , define increase dilatation antero-posterior renal pelvic diameter ( APRPD ) , marker significant obstruction . But , wait increase hydronephrosis , definition deterioration kidney , even precede loss function , remain unsatisfactory therefore early marker need improve patient ' management . Determining reliable early predictive marker future deterioration renal function child UPJO considerably change current management child avoid unnecessary surgery reversible case able offer early surgery renal deterioration pathological case . It could also determine patient need close surveillance need monitor often . Two potential marker recently describe : cortical transit time ( CTT ) measure renogram , show recent retrospective study , associate need surgery , positional variation APRPD measure sonography , also find prognostic value recently publish pilot study . Both criterion promise need evaluate prospectively large population . The investigator propose study prospectively prognostic value CTT secondary objective , determine prognostic value positional variation APRPD . The investigator able compare two prognostic marker .</detailed_description>
