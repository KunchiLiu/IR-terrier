	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Analysis Intracranial Aneurysms Recanalization After Endovascular Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With rapid development endovascular technique , endovascular treatment become first line treatment intracranial aneurysm ( IAs ) . Compared microsurgical clipping , less invasive low morbidity show endovascular treatment . However , aneurysms recanalization drawback modality . It report many factor , include complete initial embolization , stent assist coiling , dense pack flow diverter , could reduce recanalization rate . Larger size , wide neck , rupture status intraluminal thrombosis report risk factor aneurysm recanalization . However , analysis hemodynamic risk factor affect aneurysm recanalization conduct large prospective series patient . Hemodynamics report play important role aneurysm initiation , growth rupture . Previous study show hemodynamics associate outcomes aneurysms endovascular treatment . High wall shear stress flow velocity risk factor aneurysm recanalization . However , relationship hemodynamics aneurysm outcome still unclear . To explore hemodynamic predictor aneurysm recanalization great value clinical practice . Hemodynamic analysis intracranial aneurysms recanalization endovascular treatment ( HARET ) prospective trial design collect large series patient aneurysms treat endovascularly analyze hemodynamic factor affect aneurysm recanalization .</detailed_description>
