	<brief_summary>This research study do determine whether treatment L- Dihydroxyphenylserine ( L-DOPS ) versus placebo ( inactive substance look like study drug ) addition Parkinson Disease ( PD ) drug improve balance , walk , reduce risk fall and/or severity fall PD subject . The study also do determine effectiveness , safety , tolerability L-DOPS , whether decrease Freezing Gait ( FOG ) , improve apathy ( generalized disinterest ) show relationship apathy slow movement fall risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Among top three priority present National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) Council 22 final recommendation critical need advance Parkinson Disease ( PD ) research 2014 develop effective treatment dopa-resistant feature PD . These feature include symptom gait balance problem , freeze gait lead fall . In order goal realize , dysfunctional motor pattern patient gait balance problem need accurately define assessed use body-fixed sensor newer computation technology enhance sensitivity specificity measurement facilitate long-term follow-up . The propose research meet challenge determine appropriate intervention ( L-DOPS ) dopa-resistant feature PD improve gait posture use innovative quantitative analysis derive body-worn sensor . Injuries associate fall incidence continue pose significant burden person Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) term human suffer economic loss . Annual fall incidence rate range 50-70 % patient PD . Recurrent fall especially , major cause disability PD . The resulting loss independence treatment cost add substantially healthcare expenditure PD estimate $ 27 billion annually2 . This number may rise substantially come decade entire US population age . Any intervention cost effective reduce fall risk could important benefit patient family , entire healthcare system . In study , determine whether treatment L- Dihydroxyphenylserine ( L-DOPS , Northera ) addition dopaminergic drug improve postural stability activity daily living , reduce fall risk and/or severity fall PD patients.Falls , early PD ( within 5 year diagnosis ) probably arise slow locomotion . Slowed locomotion correct dopaminergic drug , hence fall early PD decrease drug . Later PD ( 5 year diagnosis ) fall , recurrent fall , occur despite drug . There evidence fall late PD occur impair postural stability respond dopaminergic drug may make bad drug . A single fall , although serious , may partly relate even unrelated PD . `` Serious fall '' define : four limb hit ground , skull hit ground , soft tissue bone injury . However , people PD fall repeatedly . In patient role impaired postural stability stress . Although mechanisms underlying impaired postural stability well-known patient PD , attention focus noradrenergic system . L-DOPS , drug enhances norepinephrine level peripheral central nervous system , show moderate orthostatic hypotension , often improve PD symptom . There evidence mechanism related norepinephrine center basal forebrain locus ceruleus play role maintain postural stability activity daily live . They may play role prevent ameliorate fall freeze gait . FOG major problem patient PD fall . There evidence L-DOPS , improve FOG , decrease risk fall . Additionally , evidence indicate L-DOPS decrease fall independent improve FOG . Apathy , major disable non-motor symptom PD , may relate decreased central norepinephrine level . Apathy may associate slow movement slow movement may contribute fall . There evidence L-DOPS , increase central norepinephrine , may improve apathy may result decrease risk fall .</detailed_description>
