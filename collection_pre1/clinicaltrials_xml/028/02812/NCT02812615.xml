	<brief_summary>This community-based intervention study undertaken Mirpur , Dhaka , Bangladesh . Participants recruit two age group : child cohort ( age 12 18 month ) adult cohort ( age 18 45 year ) . The child cohort consist stunt child ( length age Z score , LAZ &lt; -2 ) , child risk stunt ( length age Z score &lt; -1 -2 ) child control . The adult cohort consist malnourish adult case ( Body Mass Index &lt; 18.5 ) adult control . After screen participant organic disease application inclusion/exclusion criterion , receive nutrition intervention . Participants eligible study test potential bio marker environmental enteropathy ( stool , urine serum ) nutritional intervention . Participants fail respond nutritional therapy ( measure anthropometric assessment ) become candidate upper gastrointestinal endoscopy biopsy . The study include duodenal biopsy control group child University Virginia Hospital Charlottesville , Virginia undergo upper GI endoscopy part clinical care per standard clinical protocol follow hospital . Adult control ( BMI &gt; 18.5 ) endoscopy collect international centre diarrhoeal disease research , Bangladesh staff clinic , Dhaka Medical College Hospital ( DMCH ) , Dhaka Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University ( BSMMU ) , Dhaka .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This community-based intervention study . Survey , screening , enrollment subject do Mirpur Dhaka city . Subjects Participants recruit two age group : child cohort ( age 12 18 month ) adult cohort ( age 18 45 year ) . The child cohort consist two group children- stunted child ( LAZ score &lt; -2 ) child risk stunting ( LAZ &lt; -1 -2 ) . A group malnourish adult ( BMI &lt; 18.5 ) also enrol parent child cross sectional survey Mirpur area Dhaka city . Sample size : Participants collect recruited cross sectional manner . Based sample size calculation 10 % precision 95 % confidence interval , minimum 35 stunted child , 35 risk stunt child 35 adult recruit . So , final sample size endoscopy 105 subject ( 35+35+35 ) . As endoscopy invasive procedure , assume one-third would fail respond nutrition intervention would give consent endoscopy . So , basic sample size increase three time minimum 105 ( 35 x 3 ) stunt child ( LAZ &lt; -2 ) , 105 ( 35 x 3 ) child risk stunting ( LAZ &lt; -1 2 ) 105 ( 35 X 3 ) malnourish adult ( BMI &lt; 18.5 ) would fail thrive . To achieve 525 stunted child , 525 child risk stunt 525 malnourished adult nutrition intervention recruit assumed ~20 % group fail respond despite nutritional intervention . For order recruitment survey least 3977 ( 1312+2665 ) child 12-18 month old 2100 adult base current prevalence malnutrition two age group require . For adult control group , number ( 35 ) adult control recruit Dhaka Medical College international centre diarrhoeal disease research , Bangladesh staff clinic convenient sample method Description field site : The study conduct among resident Mirpur , one 21 administrative unit nation 's capital , Dhaka . Recruitment , Screening Consenting If participant interested volunteer study , designate staff proceed screen consent . Screening consist review inclusion exclusion criterion list . If subject eligible participate , process proceed consent consist thorough review write consent form manner appropriate child 's parent ' / participant literacy level . Prior sign consent form , opportunity ask question study . If Field Research Assistant ( FRA ) determine participant demonstrate adequate comprehension study , consent form sign FRA child 's parent ( ) /adult participant . If parent ( ) / adult participant sufficiently literate read and/or sign consent form , consent thumb impression obtain presence witness associate study . The child 's parent ( ) / adult participant provide copy sign consent form . Detailed procedure Directly Observed Nutritional Therapy : After enrollment , participant receive daily directly observe nutritional therapy . Nutritional therapy consist egg milk provide study free cost . Duration nutrition intervention 3 , 2 2 month stunt child , child risk stunt , malnourish adult , respectively nutritional therapy deliver morning mid day meal , anytime 10:00 11:30 . Participants ask come designated nutrition center ( establish Mirpur ) daily nutritional therapy avoid issue food share . A staff visit family 's household participant default come nutrition center . In addition food base nutritional therapy , participant receive follow nutritional health support : - Anti-helminthic treatment ( Albendazole/Pyrantel Pamoate ) per national guideline - Parents/caregivers give nutritional counsel - For child cohort , parent give one sachet multiple micro-nutrient sprinkle per day two month . - Any inter-current illness detect study team also take care . Food base nutritional therapy : Supplementation usual home diet one egg , 150 ml whole milk provide additional 178 kilo-calories , 11.1 g protein , 11.5 g fat daily diet enrol subject . Sachets multiple micro-nutrient powder provide use home dinner . In order clarify role food-based nutritional therapy , comparison subgroup 40 stunt child 40 child risk stunt follow 3 2 month respectively , without nutritional therapy . At end observation period 3 2 month , nutritional therapy provide child provide enrolled participant . Discontinuation study : A child discontinue study refer medical evaluation he/she show reluctant feed consecutive 7 day include daily intake 50 % less amount food offer . A new eligible child recruit position nutritional intervention . Collection biological sample : All biological sample ( blood , urine , stool , duodenal aspirate , endoscopic biopsy ) collect per standard operative procedure ( SOPs ) prepare protocol . A total amount 5ml blood collect participant nutritional intervention . Urine collect Lactulose-Rhamnose assay , metabolomic study ; breath sample collect test small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . Second SIBO do 1-2 week prior endoscopy finding endoscopy compare breath test . Fecal sample collect biomarkers , Taqman array card ( TAC ) assay Microbiome/Microbiota age Z-score ( MAZ ) /Bug fluorescence-activated cell sort . Detailed procedure Bio-marker test The bio-markers go tested are- Stool bio-markers - Regeneration gene 1Beta - Neopterin - Myeloperoxidase - Alpha-1-antitrypsin - Calprotectin - The TaqMan Array Card enteropathogen - Gut Microbiome analysis - Bug Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting . Urine bio-markers • Lactulose-Rhamnose test Blood bio-markers - C- Reactive Protein - Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein - Soluble cluster differentiation 14 - Kynurenine-Tryptophan Ratio - Glucagon-like peptide-2 - Insulin-like growth factor-2 - Tissue Transglutaminase - Ferritin - Zinc - Pepsinogen I/II Ratio - Low density lipoprotein relate receptor 1 ( LRP1 ) - Blood plasma metabolomics Other propose biomarkers • Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth After completion nutritional therapy , enrol participant assessment response include : - Anthropometric measurement - Collection one 5 ml blood sample serum bio-markers gut function screen test endoscopy biopsy procedure , procedure indicated failure thrive - Collection stool specimen bio-markers gut function - Administration lactulose-rhamnose solution collection urine 2 hour urine bio marker gut function At time , final inclusion criterion endoscopy biopsy evaluate determine whether participant fail nutritional therapy adequate response , underlie disease cause malnutrition . Failure nutritional therapy study , failure respond , define absence underlying disease tuberculosis : - LAZ score remain &lt; -2 stunt child cohort - LAZ score remain &lt; -1 `` risk stunting '' child cohort - BMI &lt; 18.5 &lt; 10 % increase BMI adult . Participants meet study definition `` failure respond '' check presence secondary cause malnutrition like tuberculosis , carcinoma , parasitic infection etc . Stool microscopy parasite identification do icddr , b parasitology lab soon possible collection stool sample . If nothing conclusive find , participant may request undergo preparation upper GI endoscopy biopsy , may benefit evaluation identify potential cause ( ) intervention failure determine appropriate therapeutic course . It also benefit others validate non-invasive bio-marker signature Environmental Enteric Dysfunction . Participants undergo endoscopy receive necessary treatment accord diagnosis . Participants celiac disease clot disorder ( test prothrombin time / International Normalized Ratio coagulopathy ) exclude study . Endoscopy upper gastrointestinal tract do per standard recommend North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology Nutrition ( NASPGHAN0 , American College Gastroenterology ( ACG ) American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) .</detailed_description>
