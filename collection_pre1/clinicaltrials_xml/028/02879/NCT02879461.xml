	<detailed_description>Stenosis symptomatic lumbar canal present series degenerative change affect various vertebral segment structure , include : joint zigoapofisária , yellow ligament , articular capsule intervertebral disk . These change decrease area spinal canal press neural structure may present clinically narrow tunnel syndrome . This presentation first describe Verbiest associate anatomical change clinical manifestation ; correspond low back pain , pain leg worsen fact ambulate improve rest , presentation call neurogenic claudication . The lumbar canal stenosis divide two main type ; congenital acquire . The first associate reduced size pedicle , lead reduction diameter spinal canal , common patient achondroplasics . The acquire consider common type associate aging , include anatomical structure lumbar segment . With age population number symptomatic patient increase , although statistic define stenosis symptomatic lumbar canal main reason surgical approach spine patient 60 year age . As described Daffner et al reduction blood flow lead production inflammatory mediator , associate anatomical change previously describe lead clinical picture lameness pain low limbs Treatment patient begin guidance disease , adequate pain control , physical therapy exercise maintain activity daily live . If measure fail surgical approach may necessary , especially patient exercise intolerance , difficulty walk urinary incontinence . The surgical approach despite widely study literature prospective control study rare , find series case study retrospective study , try evaluate effectiveness surgery compare rehabilitation symptomatic patient attempt assess impact surgery associate compare therapy isolate therapy patient . 2.OBJETIVOS The aim study evaluate effectiveness surgical approach associate physiotherapy compare physiotherapy alone quality life lumbar narrow tunnel syndrome . Secondary objective : evaluate influence physical therapy muscle gain improve condition patient . To evaluate incidence complication patient undergo surgical approach . 3 . PATIENTS AND METHODS 3.1 - Delineation Our research contain control prospective , randomize blind evaluator evaluate effectiveness surgical approach physical therapy associate isolated physical therapy symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis . 3.2 - Patients As research subject randomize 62 patient board electronic randomization .. They include patient age 50 75 year , gender , agree participate work , previously agree sign consent form . Patients subject anthropometric assessment , altitude record , weight presence associate comorbidities . After initial evaluation , patient randomize , group undergo surgery 3 week postoperatively initiated rehabilitation program , second group isolate physiotherapy . As evaluation factor , also give bottle paracetamol 750 mg dated sheet , instructed register day number capsule take period 90 day . 3.3 - Clinical diagnosis In clinical diagnosis case presence claudication walk 100m least two follow complaint low limb pain , weakness , burn tingle worsens walk improves stop ambulation may may It associate low back pain . 3.4 - Radiological diagnosis In study , presence lumbar canal stenosis consider area less 100mm2 , base criterion Hamanishi measure MRI lumbar spine follow-L3 S1 . All patient underwent MRI device 1 Tesla ( Philips , Giroscan ) belong image Hospital Santa Marcelina , SP . The test do patient supine cushion knee maintain flexion hip knee . To avoid bias channel area due angle , cut make parallel disc , accept difference angle 5 . The calculation base mathematical value , follow : calculated laterolateral diameter ( ) anteroposterior ( b ) major axis whose data provide computer program ( OSIRIX® 2010 ) scan image . In case difference , figure would recalculate decide whether , , average value measure . After calculate value divide two , individually multiply value π ( PI ) . The obtained result multiply constant range 0.8 ( channel circular ) , 0.7 ( channel elliptical ) , presence 0.6 0.5 facet compression , compression make disc facet . Thus , ( / 2 ) x ( b / 2 ) x π ( constant ) . 3.5 - Intervention After patient 's initial assessment take part study . Will randomize one group 1st group associate decompression arthrodesis implant placement type pedicle screw , include patient require decompression three level . After three week surgical treatment patient start rehabilitation program physiotherapy assistance weekly frequency period 12 week . The second group subject rehabilitation program isolate identical 1st group 12 week . Both group offer 750 mg paracetamol 3 take daily 90 day . The evaluation carry time inclusion project , patient undergoes surgery perform surgery follow week assessment . The second evaluation conduct 4 week , group , evaluation conduct compare muscle loss surgery . The following evaluation perform T12 , 12 week start rehabilitation , 24 48 week start rehabilitation . They also evaluate incidence complication patient undergo surgery . Patients medical treatment opt surgical treatment may time study . As auxiliary method evaluation make mensuramento quadriceps diameter sural triceps owner ? . 3.6 - Assessment tool 1 . Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) : instrument subjectively assess pain use visual analog scale , patient quantifies degree pain follow line 0 10 cm , 0 pain 10 unbearable pain ( FERRAZ , 1990 ) . The patient ask pain felt walk last week . 2 . Roland-Morris extract questionnaire physical component Sickness Impact Profile , plus question , phrase `` back . '' This questionnaire consist 24 question relevant daily live individual low back pain , easy application , apply less 5 minute immediately score 3 . 6-minute walk test : use evaluate functional capacity patient . The test perform track 22 meter travel maximum speed achieve patient six minute follow guideline American Thoracic Society ( American Toracic Society ( ATS ) Committee Proficiency Standards Clinical Pulmonary Function Laboratories ) . 4 . Short Form SF36 : generic instrument ass quality life , translate English Portuguese validate 36 question divide eight area . In questionnaire discuss aspect related functional capacity , limitation physical aspect , pain , general health , vitality , social functioning , emotional aspect mental health . The score range zero one hundred , zero bad health condition , one hundred best . 5 . Scale Likert : It psychometric scale commonly use questionnaire patient report opinion directly , accord view treatment : much well , somewhat good , good , bad worse . 6 . Disability Index Oswestry The ODI use functional evaluation lumbar spine , incorporate measure pain activity . The scale consist 10 question six alternative , whose value range 0 5 . 3.7 - Calculation n. Considering 80 % power 5 % significance , compare VAS two group 5 different time , consider standard deviation equal 2 minimum difference measure equal 2 , take 31 individual group great certainty validity result .</detailed_description>
