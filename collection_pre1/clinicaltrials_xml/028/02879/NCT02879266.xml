	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immunogenicity Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine ( TetraVax-DV ) TV005 Flavivirus-Naive Adults 50 70 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue virus ( DENV ) widespread tropical subtropical region world . There four serotypes dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) ; cause dengue infection . Infection dengue virus range mild illness life-threatening disease . TetraVax-DV TV005 ( also refer TV005 ) live attenuate recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine develop protect four dengue virus serotypes . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity TV005 adults 50 70 year age history previous flavivirus infection . Participants randomly assign receive subcutaneous injection either TV005 placebo study entry ( Day 0 ) . After receive injection , participant record temperature 3 time day Day 16 . Additional study visit occur Days 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 180 . Visits include physical examination blood collection .</detailed_description>
