	<brief_summary>The standard usual treatment disease consist two chemotherapy drug gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel give together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Nab-Paclitaxel v Gemcitabine , Nab-Paclitaxel , Durvalumab Tremelimumab 1st Line Therapy Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Durvalumab new type drug many type cancer . Laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer reactivate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . Durvalumab show shrink tumour animal study people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone . Tremelimumab new type drug various type cancer . It work similar way durvalumab may improve effect durvalumab . This may also help slow growth cancer cell may cause cancer cell die . Tremelimumab show shrink tumour animal study people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone use durvalumab . Combinations durvalumab tremelimumab also study combined show increase tumour shrinkage animal compare either drug alone combination studied people , clear offer well result standard treatment .</detailed_description>
