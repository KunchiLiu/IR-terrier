	<brief_summary>The technique investigator propose perform colorectal colo-anal anastomosis patient underwent low ultra-low anterior resection rectal cancer could potentially reduce anastomotic leakage rate well trans-anal introduction circular stapler , elimination previous suture line dog ear , combine direct inspection anastomosis , easy performance trans-anal air leak test eventually direct repair small anastomotic defect . Another important point cancer surgery easily identification distal margin . In fact , technique simple perform , reproducible safe term complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>-Study design Subjects study prospectively enrol January 2013 January 2016 participate center . All patient sign write informed consent include possibility future publication accord Italian bioethics law . Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval obtain local Ethical Committee center compliance Principals Helsinki Declaration . -Preoperative assessment preparation All case discuss individually colorectal multidisciplinary meeting standard preoperative stag rectal cancer include ; colonoscopy biopsy , CT chest , abdomen , MRI pelvis and/or endo-rectal ultrasound . All patient evaluate preoperative expert anesthesiologist individual co-morbidity classification accord ASA score . The day surgery mechanical bowel preparation 4 liter PEG ( PolyEthilene Glycol ) administer together liquid diet . An adequate thromboembolic prophylaxis low molecular weight heparin give even surgery . Antibiotic prophylaxis second generation cephalosporin administer induction anesthesia . -Surgical technique The low ultra-low anterior resection total mesorectal excision ( TME ) perform , either open , laparoscopic , robotic . Just rectal division , circular anal dilator ( CAD ) device introduce anal canal fix four 0-silk suture perianal skin apply 4 cardinal 's point . The rectal inspection carry Purse Suture Anoscope ( PSA ) correctly identify proximal distal extension tumor . After rectum divide linear curve stapler CAD direct inspection . Four 2-0 prolene suture trans-anally place rectal stump ; 2 extremity suture line ( left right ) two 1 cm medially previous two suture . Circular stapler introduce CAD ( 29 33 mm KOL stapler , Touchstone International Medical Science Co. , Ltd. ) , 4 tail prolene stitch introduce stapler channel ( 2 leave 2 right side instrument ) gently pull order obtain gradual homogeneous traction tissue . After elimination previous suture line dog ear , stapler fire . The rectal anastomosis carefully inspect trans-anally test intraoperatively air leak test trans-anal air insufflation pelvis immerse physiological saline detect bubble , competence donut . If anastomosis consider safe need protective stoma leave discretion operate surgeon . CAD may remove end surgery , leave place 3-4 day postoperative provide safe fast access anastomosis inspection well reduce endo-luminal pressure . - Postoperative care The postoperative care concise standard care patient underwent low ultra-low rectal resection , thromboembolic prophylaxis continue inform single low molecular weight heparin 5000 IU 8 hour postoperative accord risk status patient . Antibiotics 3 day postoperative inform 1 gm 2nd generation cephalosporin . We encourage fast tract surgery inform early feeding mobilization describe ; - 1st POD : removal urinary catheter , start mobilization , - 2nd POD : start oral fluid , - 3rd-4th POD : start semi-solid solid feeling , - 5-6th POD : discharge home ( perform contrast enema colonoscopy ) . - Definition anastomotic leak There constant definition anastomotic leak , adapt criterion recently publish Adams Papagrigoriadis [ 8 ] ; feculent material drain wound , extravasation dye contrast enema , anastomotic defect visualize colonoscopy , presence peri-anastomotic air fluid visualize CT scan . - Patient 's fellow-up Patients followed-up outpatient 's clinic one week , two week , one month postoperative . A follow-up occurred time stoma reversal patient diversion form colonoscopy access anastomotic integrity preoperative anesthetic fitness usual . Follow-up continue twelve month ' postoperative aid complete colonoscopy . - Variables study statistical analysis Basic demographic data record include age sex patient well detailed information BMI , ASA , stage distance tumor anal verge , neo-adjuvant chemotherapy , type surgical approach ( open , laparoscopic robotic procedure ) , duration operation , postoperative hospital stay , postoperative morbidity mortality . Data analyze use excel SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Science ) version 21 program Microsoft Windows . Quantitative data express mean Â± SD possible .</detailed_description>
