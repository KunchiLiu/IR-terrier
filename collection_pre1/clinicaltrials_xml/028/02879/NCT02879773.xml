	<brief_summary>This study use CT scan assess airflow lung , scan quick , cheap painless . The information scan may help doctor tell patient suitable surgery cure early stage lung cancer . It may also help doctor tell patient would benefit surgery emphysema diagnose type lung disease . The investigator follow patient go surgery test well scan predicts function lung surgery . The investigator follow patient investigate lung disease test accurate scan get diagnosis right .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Assessment Regional Ventilation ( CURVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT scan breathe breathe ( CTPVe ) assess regional airflow within lung , use newly develop software describe Aliverti et al . This provide information function part lung . The investigator aim assess feasibility large trial use CTPVe guide treatment lung disease develop statistical model need use trial . Surgery provide best prospect cure early Non-small cell lung cancer . In UK half people early lung cancer undergo surgery poor lung function may barrier removal part lung . Many patient lung cancer also emphysema lung disease reduce lung function . Actual post-operative lung function often well predict current method . The investigator assess regional airflow lung compare airflow patient lung function surgery ass CTPVe predict postoperative lung function , enable people consider suitable curative surgery , Severe emphysema debilitating , surgical treatment improve symptom emphysema ; include lung volume reduction surgery , endobronchial valve endobronchial coil . Each suitable certain patient difficult predict benefit . The investigator assess regional airflow lung compare airflow patient lung function treatment emphysema assess CTPVe predict benefit surgery . There hundreds subtypes interstitial lung disease respond different type treatment diagnose subtype difficult . Patients may need undergo surgery get diagnosis subtype associate major risk , include death . The investigator assess regional airflow lung compare pattern final subtype interstitial lung disease ass CTPVe could mean future patient need surgery diagnosis .</detailed_description>
