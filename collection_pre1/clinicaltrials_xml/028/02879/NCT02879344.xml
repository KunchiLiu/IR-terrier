	<brief_summary>ECMO ( extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ) blood oxygenation technical purification carbon dioxide mean extracorporeal circulation use pump ( identical use cardiac surgery ) membrane permit gas exchange . This technique use almost 40 year acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) benefit many technology improvement past 10 year . The circuit fully pre-heparin , impose obtain activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) high . Centrifugal pump limit risk intravascular hemolysis . The multi-perforated drainage cannula place femoral vein jugular longer need maintain hypervolaemia ensure sufficient flow . The membrane ensure gas exchange polymethylpentene . This hollow fiber system ensure gas exchange . In light recent technical improvement , manufacturer indicate membrane use 3 week . However , day use , fibrinoplaquettaires microthrombi form ECMO circuit , cannula oxygenator , decrease membrane efficiency impose early change circuit . This hypercoagulable state reveal study classical plasma marker coagulation . There far reliable predictive marker thrombus formation , indicate need change circuit . The production microparticles ( MPs ) characteristic cell subject activation apoptosis . MPs membrane Smaller fragment release extracellular milieu rupture asymmetry distribution membrane phospholipid characterize presence phosphatidylserine ( PhtdSer ) surface , well various antigen express cell origin . The PhtdSer pro-coagulating surface go assemble enzyme responsible formation thrombin increase proportionally TF activity ultimately leading fibrin polymerization vessel . The vesiculation phenomenon exist healthy subject . In human pathology , many example emphasize fundamental role MP clot thrombosis . The PM generate fault associate bleeding disorder ( Scott syndrome , dysv√©siculation syndrome ) . Conversely , high circulating level MP find many thrombotic disease ( myocardial infarction , diabetes , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , preeclampsia ... ) . Platelet intense monocyte endothelial activation , observed sepsis severe trauma , accompany generation procoagulant MP carrier tissue factor ( TF ) . These MP diffuse vascular compartment pathogenic potential may exacerbate inflammatory thrombotic response play lead role trigger DIC . More recently , various study show microparticles activation marker injury , also cellular element true pathogenic role . Because contain express surface various biological effector ( adhesion molecule , tissue factor , inflammatory mediator apoptogenic , growth factor ... ) microparticles able interact environment modulate cellular different way property target cell . And platelet leukocyte microparticles could actively participate thrombotic process increase adhesion monocytes endothelial cell , induce endothelial procoagulant response .</brief_summary>
