	<brief_title>Study Hierarchy Afferents Postural Control Children With Dyslexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate postural control importance proprioception , evaluate static dynamic posturography , dyslexic child compare age-matched control group . Posturographic data questionnaire motion sickness disorder use proprioceptive disorder index . This study aim well characterize dyslexic population technique target central integration sensory proprioceptive afferent . The purpose study search postural deficiency syndrome , study proprioception posturography , quantitative normalize data analyze population . Moreover , data could allow objective evaluation reeducation quantifiable reproducible parameter order judge effectiveness . The demonstration existence relationship proprioceptive disorder dyslexia imply specific reeducation care patient . A study use validated standard index necessary . The presence postural disorder major susceptibility motion sickness could contribute distinguish different form dyslexia thus complementary actual medical , orthophonic neuropsychological criterion . In evaluation , important distinguish visuo-attentional dyslexia phonological dyslexia involve distinct anatomo-functional neuronal circuit .</detailed_description>
