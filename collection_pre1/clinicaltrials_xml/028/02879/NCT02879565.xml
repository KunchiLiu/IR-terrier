In absence overt behavioral response patient , imaging-based diagnostic method first use ass whether cerebral area preserve UWS patient show activation primary sensory cortex UWS patient , whether occurs auditory , visual somatosensory level . Unavoidable technical ethical issue raise clinician respond request : 1 . Is technically possible generalize neuroimaging protocol healthcare institution ? 2 . Is ethically acceptable propose neuroimaging protocol without accurate estimation psychological impact family caregiver ? The present study aim understand anticipate technical ethical issue relate evaluation consciousness functional neuroimaging . How evaluation awareness patient affect caregiver family member investigate . By use qualitative research hop expectation clarify experience family , clinician nurse face situation . Will include research professional caregiver person closely related UWS patient : - Family member close circle visit patient regular basis - Referring clinician - Nurses charge patient ' care This prospective study use qualitative , interview-based , research .
