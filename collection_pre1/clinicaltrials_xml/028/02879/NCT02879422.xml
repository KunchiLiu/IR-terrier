	<brief_summary>Type 2 Diabetes ( TD2 ) lead cause new case preventable blindness country ( gold-standard treatment , laser photocoagulation proven effective prevent vision loss end stage eye disease due proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) occur 3 6 % cases.Therefore , ongoing search predictive factor sight threaten stage diabetic retinopathy become important . Previous study examine candidate predictive factor diabetic eye disease mostly focus systemic risk factor lead PDR . Among various clinical parameter , increase HbA1c % level , uncontrolled blood pressure , diabetes duration , neuropathy elevate triglyceride associate PDR . Some genetic factor may also account development PDR prospectively consider study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In previous study ( 2011 ) , investigator demonstrate statistically significant relation Endothelial Lipase ( EL ) c.584C &gt; T polymorphism occurrence diabetic retinopathy 396 french patient diabetes type 2 ( DT2 ) longitudinal follow-up . Secondly ( 2014 ) subgroup 287 DT2 patient , investigator show impact EL rare T allele consistent recessive mode inheritance , homozygotes rare allele differ carrier major allele . Importantly , homozygote rare T allele likely present advance stage diabetic retinopathy ( severe non proliferative proliferative disease ) particularly proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Based model investigator decide conduct case-control prospective study compare 155 french patient DT2 PDR ( case ) 155 french patient DT2 without PDR ( control ) basis two genetic parameter : EL c.584C &gt; T polymorphism investigator previously study C ( -106 ) T aldose reductase polymorphism widely study diabetic retinopathy .</detailed_description>
