	<detailed_description>Stroke first cause disability world , high social impact . Recovery partial 85 % stroke survivor , 35 % persist serious disability . The increase lifespan lead rise incidence stroke , therefore rise number people require rehabilitation program . Rehabilitation program mainly focus walking recovery , insufficient attention pay upper limb recovery . Thirty 60 % patient treated conventional therapy present functional deficit paretic arm , result impairment activity daily live . Robot-mediated therapy ( RT ) propose literature viable approach rehabilitation upper limb . A first meta-analysis 262 subject show duration/intensity conventional therapy ( CT ) match robot-assisted therapy , difference exists two group term motor recovery , activity daily live , strength motor control ; instead , RT add CT , great effectiveness observe , compare regular CT alone ( 5 ) . A subsequent meta-analysis Mehrholz et al. , include 19 trial ( involve 666 subject ) , show RT effective intervention improve patient ' activity daily live ( SMD 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.11 0.75 , P = 0.009 , I2 = 67 % ) . In sample , stratify time since disease onset , analysis confirm RT effective improving activity daily live 224 acute sub-acute patient ( within 3 month stroke onset ) ( SMD 0.64 , 95 % CI 0.14 1.15 , P=0.01 , I2 =69 % ) . The finding confirm 334 chronic patient ( 3 month stroke ) ( SMD 0.85 , 95 % CI -0.27 1.97 , P=0.14 , I2 =94 % ) . As outcome , robotic therapy effective improve upper extremity function ( SMD 0.45 , 95 % CI 0.20 0.69 , P = 0.0004 , I2 = 45 % ) , muscular strength ( SMD 0.48 , 95 % CI -0.06 1.03 , P = 0.08 , I2 = 79 % ) . Finally , RT well accept patient , marked increase number drop-outs , serious adverse event rare unrelated robotic treatment ( 6 ) . In update meta-analysis , publish 2015 , research team confirm RT effective therapy improve activity daily live ( SMD 0.37 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.11 0.64 , P = 0.005 , I² = 62 % ) , motor function ( SMD 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.18 0.51 , P &lt; 0.0001 , I² = 36 % ) strength ( SMD 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.01 0.70 , P = 0.04 , I² = 72 % ) upper limb . RT well accept patient , marked increase number drop-outs ( RD 0.00 , 95 % CI -0.02 0.03 , P = 0.84 , I² = 0 % ) , serious adverse event rare unrelated robotic treatment . However , author conclude evidence quality low , highlight need rigorous study . It note author review highlight fact study review heterogeneous term study design ( two arm , four arm , parallel group cross-over , duration follow-up selection criterion ) , device use therapeutic treatment , patient ' characteristic ( time since disease onset ) , methodological protocol ( method randomization , blindness outcome assessor group allocation , presence absence intention treat analysis ) . However , author emphasize limitation inability blind therapist participant , i.e . so-called contamination ( provision intervention control group ) , co-intervention ( therapist unintentionally provide additional care either treatment comparison group ) often present rehabilitation study . Moreover , point sometimes sample select accord comorbidities , age , spasticity pain ; instead , clinical practice patient often old , prevalence comorbidity , pain , spasticity and/or limitation articular function higher report study analyze . Therefore , inclusion criterion allow effect robotic treatment evaluate large sample patient stroke , clinical characteristic close possible real-world clinical setting , desirable . Many author highlight impact cost great sustainability RT compare CT . The latter require ratio one therapist one patient , RT , adequate training therapist , allow ratio one therapist every three four patient , depend technology use . RT allow patient ' improvement assess even single treatment session , constantly monitor rehabilitation program therefore well define best rehabilitation strategy . In fact , thanks possibility system available , possible customize treatment base patient ' clinical characteristic . Last least , robotic device involve motivate patient , provide visual auditory feedback virtual reality program form game . Training progress increasingly difficult stage link patient progress . This become important stimulus increase active participation patient rehabilitation program . Almost scientific paper literature focused effect use one , , two robotic device , compare conventional approach . However , even though anatomy motor function upper limb , especially hand , extremely complex , commercial device act limit number joint limit workspace plane . By contrast , conventional therapy whole upper limb routinely treat three-dimensional space , upper limb normally require move accomplish daily activity , normally explore . In light , difficult compare effect robotic traditional approach . This result need multi-set robots electromechanical system , act different joint and/or different plane , upper limb rehabilitation stroke patient . To best knowledge , effect similar approach , i.e . use multi-set robotic device restore motor function patient stroke , never compare conventional approach . Moreover , effect ideally explore large sample subject representative clinical practice . Hypothesis . The rationale behind study multi-set robotic device use treat whole upper limb may effective conventional treatment improve upper limb motor performance , since raise degree motivation participation among patient , provide intensive , standardized individualized treatment . Therefore , investigator wish verify hypothesis large sample subject , within multicenter study use multi-set robotic device outcome measure , obtain better-quality scientific evidence currently available literature . Aim : ass , use evidence-based criterion ( RCT ) , effectiveness rehabilitation program target upper limb joint stroke patient , use multi-set robotic technological system , compare conventional approach .</detailed_description>
