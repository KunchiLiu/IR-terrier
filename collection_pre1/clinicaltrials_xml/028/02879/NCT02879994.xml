	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With EGFR Mutant , Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Naive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy ( objective response rate [ ORR ] ) front-line pembrolizumab metastatic EGFR mutation positive program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) + ( &gt; 1 % immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety ( adverse event tabulation grade ) front-line pembrolizumab metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ ( &gt; 1 % IHC ) NSCLC . II . Determine efficacy ( progression free survival [ PFS ] , overall survival [ OS ] ) front-line pembrolizumab metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ ( &gt; 1 % IHC ) NSCLC . III . Determine ORR , PFS OS subsequent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy patient EGFR-sensitizing mutation pembrolizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVE : I. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers potential correlation response . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month , every 9 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
