	<brief_summary>State question Over past decade , incidence melanoma ( MM ) steadily increase France develop country . This increase incidence concern mainly MM thin incidence MM thick represent true `` killer '' , mortality MM remain stable increase slightly period . These epidemiological data observation everyday medical practice dermatologist suggest existence different growth pattern within MM . Indeed , MM progress slowly sometimes decades diagnosis thin time resection . Conversely , others MM grow quickly , result thick tumor despite diagnosis resection sometimes early . These fast growing MM ( FGMM ) probably contribute significantly relative mortality MM , improve screening failed influence day . Our team already demonstrate growth kinetics MM prognostic factor tumor aggressiveness regardless thickness tumor . Using method calculate growth rate , Australian team recently study growth rate population patient suffer MM . In population 1/3 MM growth 0.5 mm per month . Clinical aspect FGMM risk factor individual ( injury symmetrical achromic regular occurrence among old low-nevi ) . The European Australian people different particular regard prevention policy , result extrapolate French population.The main objective identify risk factor FGMM French propulation</brief_summary>
