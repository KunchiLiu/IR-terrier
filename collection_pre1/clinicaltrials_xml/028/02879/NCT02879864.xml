	<brief_summary>Fatigue symptom commonly associate diagnosis cancer . Fatigue often appear diagnosis cancer , increase treatment chemotherapy persist year treatment 35 % patient . Fatigue earliest important symptom describe cancer patient . Its prevalence cancer chemotherapy patient 70 100 % . Fatigue common cancer patient general population type patient . Typically described lack energy associate mental disorder , fatigue related cancer extremely debilitate . The cause many , mainly include cancer , side effect due treatment , sleeplessness due pain , anxiety depression . The cancer-related fatigue negative significant direct impact aspects patient 's quality life , especially physical , social behavioral . Despite availability certain treatment advance biomedical research , fatigue remain inevitable consequence cancer treatment . The therapeutic use natural light medicine date back late nineteenth century . Its remarkable effect stimulation immune system fight infection cause development first therapy technique ( also call luxthérapie ) award 1903 Nobel Prize medicine physiology . Light play fundamental role regulation circadian rhythm homeostatic . The mechanism action pass path `` non-visual '' involve melanopsin ganglion cell locate retina . Activation pineal gland ( epiphysis ) melanopsin cell allow transduce information `` shadow light '' melatonin synthesis serotonin . Today , effectiveness therapy well establish treat fatigue-related disorder chronic fatigue , seasonal depression seasonal non-certain sleep disorder melatonin metabolism disturb . Light therapy , mechanism action , allow reprogramming `` biological clock improve synchronization circadian rhythm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses Some study show inverse relationship cancer-related fatigue time exposure natural light cancer patient . This association suggest existence vicious circle side effect chemotherapy ( physical fatigue moral ) , cause decrease outdoor activity therefore reduction light exposure time natural . This result strengthen initial patient 's state fatigue . In interesting way , vitamin D synthesize large part due light play cancer protective role ] , especially prevention treatment pancreatic cancer example . Furthermore paradoxical way , disruption circadian rhythm correlate development tumor progression vitro , vivo tumor growth incidence cancer human . Notoriously , direct effect light therapy cancer-related fatigue little discussed literature . Data obtain small sample patient indicate light therapy improve quality life reduce fatigue patient breast cancer chemotherapy . To date , There data effect light therapy cancer-related fatigue general , patient treat chemotherapy . The purpose pilot study evaluate role light therapy cancer-related fatigue patient 6 month follow initiation first-line chemotherapy . Primary objective To assess effect daily therapy fatigue patient locally advanced metastatic cancer treat chemotherapy . secondary objective Evaluate impact daily light therapy quality life , pain , anxiety depression , tolerance chemotherapy medico-economic benefit .</detailed_description>
