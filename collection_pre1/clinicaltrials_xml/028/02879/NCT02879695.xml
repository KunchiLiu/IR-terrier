	<brief_title>Blinatumomab Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Poor-Risk Relapsed Refractory CD19+ Precursor B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability blinatumomab give combination nivolumab alone , combination nivolumab ipilimumab subject poor-risk , relapsed refractory CD19+ pre-B cell ALL CD19+ mix phenotype acute leukemia ( MPAL ) . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination blinatumomab plus nivolumab , blinatumomab plus nivolumab ipilimumab confirm safety combination therapy subject poor-risk , relapsed refractory CD19+ pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) CD19+ mixed phenotype acute leukemia ( MPAL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-leukemia activity blinatumomab nivolumab , blinatumomab plus nivolumab ipilimumab , include effect minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . II . To assess preliminary anti-leukemia activity expansion cohort patient poor-risk , relapsed refractory CD19+ precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia , CD19+ mix phenotype acute leukemia ( MPAL ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine change absolute lymphocyte count distribution T cell subset ( CD4+ , CD8+ , Tregs , Teffs ) differentiation status , NK cell , B cell post-blinatumomab , immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ) therapy peripheral blood bone marrow microenvironment . II . To explore change T cell co-signaling receptor expression define T cell subpopulation canonic transcription factor expression peripheral blood bone marrow post-blinatumomab , immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ) therapy . III . To examine change expression co-signaling molecule leukemia blast ( CD10+/CD19+/CD34+ ) treatment blinatumomab checkpoint inhibitor . IV . To examine serum level cytokines treatment blinatumomab checkpoint inhibitor , include level sCTLA-4 . V. To perform immune profile T cell repertoire characterize T cell transcriptional signature treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study blinatumomab . Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 11 every 2 week year . Some patient also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 11 every 6 week 1 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
