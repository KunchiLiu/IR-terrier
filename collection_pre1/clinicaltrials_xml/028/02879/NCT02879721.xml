	<detailed_description>Barrett ` esophagus ( BE ) major esophageal pre-neoplastic lesion dysplastic transformation eventually lead cancer development . Early detection high-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) intramucosal cancer fundamental value patient . The minimally invasive endoscopic resection- ablation-techniques available curative . In patient invasive cancer far invasive resection-techniques require associate severe post-operative morbidity , mortality poor overall survival . Today , way early detection pre-neoplastic lesion endoscopic surveillance programme tissue sample histopathology , latter validate biomarker esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) -risk available . In unselected BE-population risk develop EAC low , 0.12 % annually . In patient BE low-grade dysplasia ( LGD ) number EAC 5,1 per 1000 person-years accord large Danish cohort-study . New biomarkers warrant well patient selection inclusion BE surveillance programme . Epidemiologic study demonstrate suppressed number cancer prevalence cohort different medical treatment . Anti-inflammatory , lipid-lowering anti-hypertensive drug mention . In British epidemiological study 2007 Sjöberg et al note low prevalence EAC among patient treat antihypertensive drug interfere renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) AT1R-blockers ACE-inhibitors . Wegman-Ostrosky et al link RAS `` Hallmarks cancer '' RAS directly affect tumor stromal cell , indirectly affect vascular cell angiogenesis . RAS know involved fluid electrolyte homeostasis hemodynamic regulation . The last decade endocrine signal system proven utilise tissue-based character , involved pathological condition inflammation , wound-healing even cancer , several organ system . The `` classical '' signal pathway RAS , angiotensin II ( AngII ) form help angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) affinity membrane-bound receptor ( angiotensin II type 1 2 receptor ( AT1R AT2R ) ) , challenge discovery `` alternative '' pathway enzymes receptor , make picture diverse . Reports investigator laboratory indicate existence local RAS esophageal wall musculature squamous mucosa . This explored Björkman et al 2013 , show RAS-components significantly alter patient erosive reflux disease compare healthy volunteer . In investigator late explorative study , investigator discover altered expression `` classical '' RAS component BE without dysplasia ( unpublished result ) . By possible alteration RAS-related protein-expression BE increase grade dysplasia towards EAC , investigator may possible `` pathway '' lead biomarkers cancer-development . Furthermore , already well-known anti-hypertensive drug ACE-inhibitors AT1R-blockers may interfere risk malignancy BE . The investigator therefore wish test , exploratory prospective randomize placebo-controlled setting , whether RAS-related protein-expressions BE alter addition RAS-suppressant pharmaceutical .
