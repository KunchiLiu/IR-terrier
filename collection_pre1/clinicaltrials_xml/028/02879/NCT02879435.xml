	<brief_title>Management Postoperative Pain With Preemptive Analgesia Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Labor delivery time intense pain , often influenced psychological , emotional , social , cultural , physical state parturient . Nowadays , delivery Cesarean section become frequent . Females undergo Cesarean section often wish awake postoperatively avoid excessive medication affect interaction newborn infant visitor . However , Cesarean delivery often associate severe pain , require well-planned analgesia regimen ensure adequate patient comfort satisfaction , early mobilization , decrease hospital stay . An analgesic regimen may often include multiple dos IV NSAIDs opioids adequately control pain , cost add expense hospital stay . Therefore , intervention lead improvement pain relief worthy investigation . Subcutaneous administration local anesthetic method postoperative pain control Cesarean section . Bupivacaine , widely use local anesthetic , study extensively past management postoperative pain . The postoperative analgesic effect subcutaneous wound infiltration prior incision bupivacaine extensively study Cesarean delivery ; hence , may role management pain relief bupivacaine administer specific time surgery . Therefore , present study design assess effect preincisional skin infiltration bupivacaine 0.25 % versus placebo postoperative pain relief Cesarean delivery . 120 pregnant patient randomize mean Drug Randomization Protocol ( see ) . The two group ( A ) control group preoperative wound infiltration 10ml 0.9 % preservative-free normal saline administer ; ( B ) preoperative wound infiltration 10ml 0.25 % bupivacaine administer . The primary end-point postoperative pain . On arrival recovery room , pain intensity rest assess visual analogous scale range 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) 15 , 30 , 60 minute 120 minute arrival recovery room . Drug Randomization Protocol - All surgical staff blind study drug content . A randomization checklist create Mercy biostatistician give scrub technician randomly generate list 1 ( saline ) 2 ( bupivicaine ) indicate study drug administer . The scrub technician assign study drug patient arrive sequentially follow Study Randomization Checklist . The pharmacist master list , indicate content study drug 1 2 . The scrub technician order study drug pharmacist study name number , eg . `` Kathy Tom 's study , drug 1 . '' The pharmacist instruct indicate content study relate drug scrub technician surgical staff send drug syringe label `` Kathy Tom Study - Drug # '' drug descriptive labeling cover . The Study Randomization Checklist indicate sequential participant number assign patient study entry , correspond study drug administer check box indicate drug successfully administer ( box check ordered administer ) , column record date study drug administer , column surgical record technician 's initial request study drug , medical record number patient . Sufficient information include checklist connect study drug back patient becomes necessary .</detailed_description>
