	<brief_title>Simultaneously Integrated Dose Escalation Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent radiation therapy chemotherapy standard care locally advanced cervical cancer . While several acceptable mean boost disease low pelvis ( i.e . brachytherapy , IMRT , external beam ) , limited research minimal invasive surgical resection maximal downstage . This protocol design determine dose escalation chemo radiation treat tumor bearing region within abdomen pelvis , use two drug chemotherapy first cycle mitomycin/cisplatin taxol/cisplatin along simultaneously integrated boost technique Biological target area define PET scan . This dose escalation downstage disease minimal invasive surgical resection .</detailed_description>
