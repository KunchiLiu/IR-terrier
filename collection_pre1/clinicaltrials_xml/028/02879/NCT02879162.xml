	<detailed_description>Durvalumab new type drug many type cancer . Laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer stimulate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . Durvalumab show shrink tumour animal study 1733 people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone . Tremelimumab new type drug various type cancer . It work similar way durvalumab may improve effect durvalumab . This may also help slow growth cancer cell may cause cancer cell die . Tremelimumab show shrink tumour animal study 1223 people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone use durvalumab Combinations durvalumab tremelimumab also study combined show increase tumour shrinkage animal compare either drug alone . While combination study 217 people , clear offer well result standard treatment .</detailed_description>
