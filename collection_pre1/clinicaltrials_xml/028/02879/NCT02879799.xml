	<brief_summary>In Alberta , nearly one every twelve baby bear soon ( preterm ) . Preterm baby great risk breathe feed problem , well infection , baby bear due date ( full term ) . As result , parent must leave preterm baby hospital fully develop become healthy enough take home . When time discharge , parent often ready look baby may limit involvement care baby hospital . In addition distress cost parent baby hospital , health system cost also increase long baby hospital . The purpose project test new way integrate parent care baby program call Family Integrated Care ( FICare ) . In FICare , parent educate supported nurse provide care baby ; nurse doctor still provide intravenous medication medical procedure . FICare test Ontario show promise good model care small percentage baby bear 8 week early , spend long time hospital . Now investigator want test FICare great percentage preterm baby bear 4 8 week early see parent able take baby home sooner , baby healthier . The investigator also want know FICare reduce distress parent . The investigator propose test FICare Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) Alberta implement FICare half Level II NICUs compare outcome Level II NICUs use FICare . If FICare improve outcome preterm baby parent , investigator implement Level II NICUs . In Alberta , investigator want best quality care vulnerable baby parent . This project align Alberta 's Health Research Innovation Strategy priority wellness every age ( child maternal health ) , Alberta Health Services ' quality care goal increase efficiency , effectiveness , appropriateness , acceptability health care service delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Family Integrated Care ( FICare ) Level II NICUs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year , 15 million world 's infant bear &lt; 37 week gestation ( preterm ) . In Alberta , preterm birth rate 8.43 % 2015 , represent 4,749 infant . Alberta high rate preterm birth Canada , attribute , part , delay child bear assisted reproductive technology . Approximately 20 % earliest ( &lt; 32 week gestation ) usually sickest preterm infant require care Level III neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Approximately 80 % moderate late preterm ( 32 week zero day [ 32 0/7 ] 36 week six day [ 36 6/7 ] gestation ; comprise 6.6 % live birth ) require care Level II NICU . Compared full term counterpart , moderate late preterm infant high risk poor health ( e.g. , increased hospitalization , respiratory morbidity , growth feed problem ) developmental outcome , include neurodevelopmental disability cognitive delay , communication language impairment , ] school-related problem . As gestational age ( GA ) decrease , risk chronic health problem developmental delay increase . In 2010 , care preterm infant represent large category Alberta 's expenditure pediatric health care 8.45 % , total cost approximately $ 35 million . The cost associate preterm infant great term infant increase hospital length stay ( LOS ) , resource utilization , readmission , need health , education , social service . Financial consequence parent preterm infant associate reduced workforce participation lose earnings , developmental support infant . Unquantifiable cost associate psychological distress , marital distress , social isolation . Although effective intervention parent preterm infant exist , evidence generally limited early preterm infant , cost effectiveness data lacking . Implementing new model care , Family Integrated Care ( FICare ) , Level II NICUs moderate late preterm infant great potential improve outcomes infant parent , reduce cost health care system family . Level II NICUs highly technological , critical care environment healthcare provider ( i.e. , nurse , physician , trainee , respiratory therapist , social worker , others ) often unintentionally marginalize parent pursuit optimal care preterm infant . The unexpected birth tiny infant leave parent shock , feel anxious , depressed , isolated , unprepared interact , care , infant . Preterm birth experience NICU disrupt breastfeed early parent-infant relationship , critical early brain biological development . The goal FICare change culture practice permit , encourages , support parent parent role infant Level II NICU . FICare , essence , dynamic educational intervention , learner ( parent ) , coach ( healthcare provider veteran NICU parent ) , curriculum content , implementation strategy . Veteran parent previous experience preterm infant Level II NICU . Underpinned adult learn change theory , FICare empower parent build knowledge , skill , confidence family well-prepared care infant long discharge . This model dynamic , whereby parent healthcare provider openly mutually negotiate equitable role infant 's NICU stay . Thus , role change parent learn care infant . Philosophically , effort keep parent closer infant NICU start 1950s parental presence permit visitation NICU . Later , family-centred care articulate respect family decision care . Despite comprehensive understand family-centred care recognition importance , family-centred approach remain fraught challenge , include non-facilitative physical space , restrictive access , limited parental involvement direct infant care , lack consistent information . These challenge result confusion parental role NICU , leave parent feel dissatisfy like detached visitor parent . Integrating parent central care infant next logical step evolution approach NICU care . Existing intervention include skin-to-skin care , psychological support parent ( primarily mother ) , education care preterm infant , education parent provider supportive therapy infant . A systematic review suggest psychological support parent education show great effect short- ( &lt; 1 year ) longer- ( ≥1 year ) term . While parent education take many form simple leaflet information self-modeled video interaction guidance , parent education actively engage parent infant great impact parental infant outcome . Education consistent across care provider critical ensure parental belief competence care provider . A positive relationship parent provider contributes increase satisfaction care , great willingness parent seek support care infant . Further , health care individualize accommodate sequential clinical phase admission post-discharge care infant . Adapted exist family-centred care intervention , Family Integrated Care ( FICare ) model develop pilot test preterm infant ≤ 35 week GA Level III NICU Mount Sinai Hospital , Toronto . The pilot study indicate FICare feasible safe Canada . Compared 31 matched control , 42 infant receive FICare show increase weight gain breastfeed discharge . FICare reduce LOS approximately 10 % ( personal communication , Dr. S. Lee ) mother report less stress . Based promising result , FICare Level III NICUs currently evaluate 19-centre , cRCT ; Calgary control site . With success Level III NICUs , Dr. V. Shah ( co-investigator ) implement FICare four Ontario Level II NICUs . However , Ontario study limit pre-test/post-test design . Without randomize control train ( RCT ) , evidence effectiveness FICare Level II NICUs continue plague methodological contextual limitation . The aim study refine implement FICare Level II NICUs across Alberta evaluate use cluster RCT ( cRCT ) . The investigator hypothesize compare standard care , FICare : ( 1 ) decrease LOS ( primary outcome ) ; ( 2 ) decrease incidence nosocomial infection ; ( 3 ) decrease adverse event ( e.g. , medication donor breast milk error ) ; ( 4 ) reduce number time infant feed suspend ( NPO ) concomitant intravenous therapy and/or sepsis workups ; ( 5 ) reduce readmission unplanned emergency room physician visit 2 month correct age ( CA ) ; ( 6 ) increase parental knowledge , skill , confidence care infant discharge 2 month CA ; ( 7 ) increase rate feed breast milk breastfeed self-efficacy discharge 2 month CA ; ( 8 ) decrease parental psychosocial distress ( stress , anxiety , depression ) discharge 2 month CA , ( 9 ) improve healthcare provider satisfaction ; ( 10 ) decrease direct indirect cost reduce LOS readmission . The FICare Alberta research study co-developed collaboration Alberta Health Services operational leader clinician . Nursing medical director ten Level II NICUs across Alberta embrace idea FICare . Buy-in particularly notable give site aware could randomize either FICare control condition . The investigator address potential unanticipated compensatory reaction ( i.e. , demoralization ) offer delay implementation FICare control sit . The investigator discuss development , test , execution FICare implementation plan , well integrate change new model routine care . The investigator learn several site already use element FICare , albeit unstructured unintegrated way . If result FICare show improve outcome and/or reduce cost , assist implementation provide train staff control sit .</detailed_description>
