	<detailed_description>Background : Sugars single one prime culprit dual epidemic obesity diabetes . Artificially sweeten beverage ( ASBs ) provide potentially important mean displace excess calorie free sugar diet . There , however , concern use ASBs may contribute increase risk obesity diabetes . This concern lead 2015 Dietary Guidelines American Committee ( DGAC ) recommend sugar diet replace ASBs rather `` healthy option '' water . Whether ASBs water contribute obesity remain unclear . Objective : The investigator conduct series systematic review meta-analyses ass ( 1 ) effect ASBs versus water incident overweight/obesity , body weight BMI randomize control trial ( 2 ) relation ASBs versus water incident overweight/obesity , body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) prospective cohort study . Design : Each systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement hand search reference include study . Abstracts include language restriction use . Study selection : The investigator include either randomized control trial ( RCTs ) -or prospective cohort study . RCTs include &gt; =7 day duration assess effect water versus ASBs incident overweight/obesity , body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) . Prospective cohort study include &gt; = 1-year duration ass relationship water ASBs incident overweight/obesity , body weight , BMI . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement resolve consensus . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : Three outcome assess : ( 1 ) incidence overweight/obesity , ( 2 ) body weight , BMI . Data synthesis : Risk ratio ( incident overweight/obesity ) mean difference ( body weight BMI ) pool direct comparison ( ASBs versus water ) indirect comparison ( ASBs versus SSBs water versus SSBs use SSBs common comparator ) . We perform Bayesian Network-Meta Analysis ( NMA ) . We present pooled estimate posterior mean 95 % credible interval . We also use NMA sensitivity analysis validate finding conventional generic inverse variance random-effects model . The NMA conduct use Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approach simulation use GeMTC-R package . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; =10 study , investigator also explore source heterogeneity priori subgroup analyse health status ( metabolic syndrome/diabetes , overweight , normal weight ) , dose ( &lt; =median intake , &gt; median intake ) , baseline measurement ( global abdominal adiposity ) , randomization , study design ( parallel , crossover ) , energy balance ( positive , neutral , negative ) , follow-up ( &lt; =8 week , &gt; 8 week ) , risk bias , individual domain risk bias use meta-regression analysis . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger test Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence Assessment : The quality strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition , diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate role ASBs development overweight obesity , strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
