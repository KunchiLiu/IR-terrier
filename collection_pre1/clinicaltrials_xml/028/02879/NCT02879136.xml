	<brief_summary>Gait balance problem significant source disability patient Parkinson disease . Physical therapy remain one main treatment . On hand medication , methyphenidate atomoxetine , try promising result . The outcomes gait balance Parkinson disease combination physical therapy medication mention explore yet . The investigator want evaluate whether addition medication , either low dose methylphenidate atomoxetine , physical therapy achieve improvement gait balance Parkinson disease physical therapy alone . The investigator propose pilot , single center , rater blind , prospective randomize trial . 2-arm-parallel group , intention-to-treat analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gait impairment postural instability constitute major source disability Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Increased level dependence activity daily live augment risk fall main consequence . About 87 % patient experience least one fall illness , 65 % injury require evaluation emergency room , 33 % sustain one fracture . Pedunculopontine nucleus , locus ceruleus , frontal brain cortex , striatum play critical role gait balance , dopamine , noradrenaline acetylcholine main neurotransmitter . Therefore , increase availability dopamine nigrostriatal pathway , enhance disposal central noradrenaline acetylcholine locus ceruleus theory , contribute improvement . Methylphenidate atomoxetine dopamine noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor approve treatment attention disorder . Interestingly , grow literature suggest promise role medication gait balance PD . Three open-label study report efficacy methylphenidate gait impairment patient PD . Auriel et al use single 20 mg dose methylphenidate 23 patient find improvement gait speed , stride time variability , time gait . In second study , 5 patient receive single 10-mg dose methylphenidate improvement note total walking time , total freezing time , number freeze episode , nonfreezing walking time . Another study , evaluate 50 80 mg dose methylphenidate 3 month 17 patient undergoing concomitant deep brain stimulation , find improvement time gait number freeze episode . However , randomize clinical trial methylphenidate show different result . Twenty-three subject PD moderate gait impairment screen 6- month , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Subjects randomly assign high dose methylphenidate ( maximum , 80 mg/day ) placebo 12 week cross 3-week washout . The primary outcome measure change gait composite score obtain GAITrite ( system develop measure record temporal spatial parameter gait use walkway approximately 3 meter long grid embed , pressure-sensitive sensor connect personal computer ) . Seventeen patient complete trial . There change gait composite score secondary exploratory variable fatigue , freeze , depression daily sleepiness 12 week ; however , improvement note early phase study . The discrepancy result open label study randomize study may explain dose methylphenidate substantially high RCT compare first two open-label study . Whereas patient RCT receive least 65 mg/day , patient first two open-label study receive 10-20 mg/day . It suggest efficacy methylphenidate atomoxetine varies accord dose administrate . The complex pharmacodynamic dopamine noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor presence dopaminergic therapy Levodopa dopamine agonist , elicit difference response regard administer dose . During early phase RCT trend improvement note , small dos methylphenidate use patient titrate final dose . Low chronic dos methylphenidate test improve gait balance PD trial . In one pilot study thus far evaluate atomoxetine gait freezing , trend towards improvement gait balance scale ( GABS ) note . However , study underpowered five patient participate study . Simultaneously , diverse modality physical therapy ( PT ) show improvement gait balance PD . A systematic review Cochrane database conclude different physiotherapy intervention well placebo three month , term velocity , two- six-minute walk test , step length , Timed Up &amp; Go , Functional Reach Test , Berg Balance Scale clinician-rated UPDRS . The grade improvement vary depend intervention outcome measure , range 10 30 % . To best investigator ' knowledge , combination medication physical therapy never evaluate previously gait balance PD .</detailed_description>
