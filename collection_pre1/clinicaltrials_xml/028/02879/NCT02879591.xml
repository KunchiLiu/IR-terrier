	<brief_summary>The objective AlterEgo creation interactive cognitive architecture , implementable various artificial agent , allow continuous interaction patient suffer social disorder , virtue change behavioural ( robot-based ) well morphological ( avatar-based ) property agent . The project include research fundamental clinical neuroscience , interaction modeling , development new computer-vision technique human-robot interface , well evaluation scenario patient , , train session . At end project , investigator produce new avatar-based clinical method able enhance social interaction patient . The first challenge project create avatar alter ego patient . Based recent work social robotics neuroscience , investigator hypothesize patient face artificial agent morphologically behaviourally similar , increase social interaction . The second challenge transform morphology behaviour similar artificial agent healthy different agent . The investigator assume smooth continuous behavioural shift similar/unhealthy complementary/healthy social behaviour lead well social rehabilitation . AlterEgo open door new generation social artificial agent service robotics . AlterEgo interdisciplinary project interaction Social Motor Neurosciences ( UM1 ) , Robotics ( EPFL ) , Complex Systems Dynamics ( UOB ) , Computer Vision ( DFKI ) , Psychiatry ( CHU ) . This project include set experiment start april 2014 terminate september 2016 undergoing randomise clinical research .</brief_summary>
