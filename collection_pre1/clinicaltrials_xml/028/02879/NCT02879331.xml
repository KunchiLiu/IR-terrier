	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis patient homogeneous emphysema behave differently compare heterogeneous emphysema respect exercise capacity . A good understanding difference allow investigator choose best treatment type patient . The main purpose study evaluate change exercise capacity measure cycle ergometry patient severe emphysema endoscopic lung volume reduction coil ( eLVR ) . As secondary purpose , investigator want perform exploratory , randomize study compare result two different therapeutic approach small sample patient homogeneous emphysema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Exercise Capacity Patients With Severe Emphysema Treated With Coils</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study plan include patient severe emphysema candidate go eLVR coil fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Patients homogeneous heterogeneous emphysema include . The main study intervention performance cyclo ergometry ( included daily clinical practice ) ( basal ) 6 month go eLVR coil . The subgroup patient homogeneous emphysema randomly assign follow therapeutic approach : - Group A : treatment 10 coil upper lobe - Group B : treatment 15 coil spar upper low lobe Thus , study include : - patient , performance two cycloergometries , 6 month eLVR - Also , subset homogeneous emphysema patient , open label , randomize , parallel , two arm exploratory clinical trial . Sample size formally calculate previous available data primary endpoint ( change inspiratory capacity ) . Thus , 35 patient include accord expect number patient . Recruitment period 24 month patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
