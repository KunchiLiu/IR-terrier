This health utility state measure indirectly use health-relation quality life questionnaire . Chronic disease OA know associated impairment quality life . Given OA prevalence increase age , OA often associate disease ( comorbidities ) . A cross-sectional study show comorbidities associate low health utility state OA . Investigation longitudinal impact comorbidities health utility state change need . Main objective : Determine impact comorbidities change health utility state among patient low limb OA . Secondary objective : Determine Minimal Clinically important Difference health utility state among patient low limb OA . The COMUTAR study use longitudinal data Knee Hip Osteoarthritis Longitudinal Assessment ( KHOALA ) cohort study . Health utility state measure indirectly use Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 quality life questionnaire Comorbidities assess use Functional Comorbidity Index</detailed_description>
