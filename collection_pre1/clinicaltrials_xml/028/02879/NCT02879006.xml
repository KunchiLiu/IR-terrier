	<brief_summary>The purpose study test use E-B-FAHF-2 Chinese herbal therapy combination multi-food oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) Xolair® ( Omalizumab ) help child adult allergic food able safely tolerate food allergen . Specifically protocol , food allergen milk , egg , peanut , almond , cashew , hazelnut , walnut , sesame , and/or wheat . Omalizumab consider investigational drug treatment food allergy child adult . Investigational mean approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use U.S . The researcher hope learn whether addition Chinese herbal therapy ( E-B-FAHF-2 ) improve outcome sustain unresponsiveness ( ability consume food allergen pas oral food challenge treatment 3 month ) compare placebo ( i.e . subject OIT/Omalizumab + herbal vs. OIT/Omalizumab + placebo ) , help adult child able safely ingest food allergic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior study show Chinese herbal formulation safe well-tolerated food allergic individual . While oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) lead desensitization , remain uncertain whether treatment lead last protection . Therefore , study aim use Chinese herbal formula combination OIT determine whether sustained protection achieve . All subject receive multi-allergen OIT , along 4 month course omalizumab provide add safety initial dose escalation build phase . Subjects randomize receive active Chinese herbal formula placebo . Subjects treat OIT 2 year food challenge perform assess desensitization . For achieve desensitization , treatment discontinue food challenge perform 3 month later assess sustain unresponsiveness .</detailed_description>
