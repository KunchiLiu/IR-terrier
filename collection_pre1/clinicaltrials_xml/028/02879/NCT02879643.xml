	<brief_title>Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection ( Marqibo® ) Combination With UK ALL R3 Induction Chemotherapy Children , Adolescents , Young Adults With Relapsed ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study utilize Marqibo® replacement standard vincristine combination UK ALL R3 induction child relapse ALL . The hypothesis incorporation Marqibo® combination chemotherapy safe feasible . In context pilot study , overall outcome efficacy secondary objective . It hypothesize data combination may show improved efficacy include , complete remission ( CR ) , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity , progression free survival ( PFS ) rate safety ( i.e. , neurotoxicity ) comparison outcomes historical regimen , include UK ALL R3 standard vincristine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Eligibility Criteria Age Patients must ≥ 1 ≤ 21 year age time enrollment . Diagnosis Patients must diagnosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ≥ 5 % blast bone marrow ( M2 M3 ) , without extramedullary disease ( exclude active Central Nervous System 3 involvement ) . Subjects first relapse must M3 marrow eligible . Performance Level Karnofsky &gt; 50 % patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky &gt; 50 % patient ≤ 16 year age . Prior Therapy 1 . Patients must recover acute toxic effect ( ≤ Grade 2 baseline ) prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study , unless otherwise specify . Subjects disease relate cytopenia eligible . 2 . Patients must relapse disease attain least first remission . They may first third relapse . 3 . Patients Philadelphia chromosome ( 9 ; 22 ) positive disease must receive least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor . 4 . Patients experience relapse Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) eligible , provide evidence graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) least 100 day posttransplant time enrollment . 5 . Prior anthracycline lifetime cumulative exposure : Patients must less 320 mg/m2 ( 400 mg/m2 prior cardioprotection ) lifetime exposure anthracycline chemotherapy . 6 . Hematopoietic growth factor : It must least seven day since completion therapy granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) growth factor time enrollment . It must least 14 day since completion therapy pegfilgrastim ( Neulasta® ) . 7 . Biologic antineoplastic agent : At least seven day last dose biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond seven day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss study chair vice chair . 8 . Monoclonal antibody : At least three halflives ( 30 days—whichever long ) antibody must elapse last dose monoclonal antibody . ( e.g. , Rituximab = 66 day , Epratuzumab = 69 day ) 9 . Immunotherapy : At least 30 day completion type immunotherapy , e.g . tumor vaccine , chimeric antigen receptor Tcells . 10 . Recent prior chemotherapy : At least 14 day standard vincristine completion type chemotherapy induction regimen . At least 3 week radiation therapy . At least 30 day completion investigational neoplastic agent also require . An investigational agent define drug approve licensed sale FDA institution United States , Health Canada institution Canada The Therapeutic Goods Administration institution Australia . Exceptions : 1 . There time restriction regard prior intrathecal chemotherapy provide complete recovery acute toxic effect ; allowable enroll patient receive IT Cytarabine ( ARAC ) , IT Methotrexate ( MTX ) triple IT therapy within 14 day enrollment part evaluation diagnose disease relapse . The IT therapy give within 14 day initiation protocol specify chemotherapy , substitute day 1 IT . 2 . Subjects rapidly progressive disease may receive hydroxyurea begin study therapy ; 3 . Patients relapse maintenancetype ALL therapy receive maintenance therapy disease stabilization require washout period entry study . However , must least 14 day dose standard vincristine . Renal Hepatic Function 1 . Renal function : Patient 's serum creatinine must ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) accord age . If serum creatinine great 1.5 time normal , patient must calculate creatinine clearance radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 70milliliter/min/1.73m2 . Alternatively , 24hour creatinine clearance may also use . 2 . Hepatic function : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must &lt; 3 x institutional upper limit norm ULN . Total bilirubin must ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except case subject document Gilbert 's disease ≤ 5 × ULN ) . Cardiac Function Patients must shorten fraction ≥ 27 % ejection fraction ≥ 55 % echocardiogram , cardiac MRI multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) . Reproductive Function 1 . Female patient must pregnant childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test confirm within one week prior enrollment . 2 . Female patient infant must agree breastfeed infant study . 3 . Male female patient childbearing potential must agree use effective method contraception study . Exclusion Eligibility Criteria Patients exclude active Central Nervous System ( CNS ) 3 status . Patients exclude isolated testicular disease . Patients biphenotypic leukemia exclude . Patients exclude refractory disease fourth relapse beyond , define follow : 1 . Patients four prior induction attempt , 2 . Refractory disease first great relapse reinduction attempt , 3 . Failing go remission original diagnosis two previous induction attempt . Patients exclude previously receive Marqibo® . Patients exclude know allergy drug use study , exception patient allergy PEGasparaginase receive Erwinia eligible . Patients exclude active , uncontrolled systemic fungal , bacterial , viral infection despite appropriate antibiotic treatment . Patients require azole antifungal agent exclude . Azoles must discontinue least one week prior start Marqibo® . Patients exclude plan administer nonprotocol chemotherapy , radiation therapy , another investigational agent immunotherapy study period . Patients preexist , persistent grade 2 great sensory motor neuropathy cause exclude . Patients exclude Down syndrome , significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder social issue would compromise patient safety adherence protocol treatment procedure interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result . Patients positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) exclude due increase risk complication severe infection unknown interaction Marqibo® antiretroviral drug . Active hepatitis B C infection define seropositive hepatitis B ( hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ) hepatitis C elevate liver transaminase ( define ULN per institution normal range ) .</criteria>
