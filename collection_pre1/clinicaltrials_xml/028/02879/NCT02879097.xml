	<brief_title>Efficacy-Safety-Immunogenicity Study CBT124 &amp; EU-sourced Avastin® Stage 4 NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether CBT124 Avastin® comparable term efficacy , safety , immunogenicity ; whether pharmacokinetics CBT124 match Avastin® ( pharmacokinetics nest study Indian patient ) . To test clinical equivalence term efficacy safety , two-sided test approach base pre-specified range test null hypothesis propose biosimilar either ( 1 ) inferior reference product ( 2 ) superior reference product base pre-specified equivalence margin use . The equivalence margin choose enable detection clinically meaningful difference effectiveness CBT124 , candidate biosimilar bevacizumab reference product ( EU-sourced Avastin® ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . In trial , asymmetric equivalence margin use , i.e. , upper ( superiority ) low ( inferiority ) bound equivalence margin symmetric . The goal reject null hypothesis non-equivalence accept alternative hypothesis two treatment ( case , CBT124 EU-sourced Avastin® ) equivalent ( i.e. , difference two clinically statistically meaningful ) . The hypothesis test perform determine difference primary end point ( Objective Response Rate [ ORR ] ) reference product ( EUsourced Avastin® ) propose biosimilar ( CBT124 ) within equivalence margin 95 % CI .</detailed_description>
