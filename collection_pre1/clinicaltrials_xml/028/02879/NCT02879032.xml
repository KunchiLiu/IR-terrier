	<brief_summary>Exercise treadmill test ( ETT ) frequently do , inexpensive , relatively safe investigation diagnosis ischemic heart disease prediction exercise capacity . Ischemic heart disease increase leap bound world even develop country like Bangladesh . The incidence rate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) limit male gender previously see . As cause industrialization increase life expectancy , incidence ischemic heart disease female escalate Bangladesh also . Though ETT well accept investigation diagnose CAD , high false positive false negative result ST segment response alone calculated interpretation test . Duke Treadmill Test Simple Treadmill Test valid well know score predict coronary artery disease burden efficiently ST segment response alone . Computer generate Cleveland clinic score another valid treadmill score complex algorithm effective way predict 3 year 5 year survivability . These three score well test western population best knowledge little information regard predictability CAD Bangladesh . It 's well know ETT high false positive result female population , apply score may render ETT efficient abrogate unwanted risk undergo coronary angiography diagnose CAD female . In study investigator try find accuracy commonly apply treadmill score ST segment response diagnose CAD well accuracy computer generate Cleveland Clinic Score test . Total 110 people include male female include accord inclusion exclusion criterion inform write consent take . The patient undergone ETT coronary angiogram six month confirmation identification coronary artery disease accordance recommendation ACC guideline CAG select . All available data analyze use SPSS . The accuracy different score calculate compare . According currently available data study western population treadmill score good predictability efficient abolish high false positive result female population Bangladesh .</brief_summary>
