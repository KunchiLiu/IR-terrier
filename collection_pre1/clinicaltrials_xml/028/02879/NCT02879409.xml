	<detailed_description>One last unanswered question relation influence glycemic control diabetes complication whether increase month-to-month change blood glucose ( measure variability glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ) compound complication rate alter intervention . Qatar high prevalence diabetes , affect approximately 23 % adult population ( International Diabetes Federation 2014 ) go lead development microvascular macrovascular complication result increased morbidity mortality associate disease . The fact improve glucose control type 2 well type 1 diabetes reduces risk microvascular complication well establish . However , recently demonstrate month-to-month variability ( 'rises fall ' ) glucose control also associate increase risk develop diabetes-associated problem . An individual 's long term measure blood glucose control represent amount HbA1c measure blood . The HbA1c level change slowly much long period constantly fluctuate glucose level , give good indication overall glucose control precede 2-3 month . What known whether intervention reduce variability HbA1c could , turn , lead reduction diabetes complication . For example even HbA1c mean optimal 7 % , high variability HbA1c measure ( large standard deviation ) may still lead complication . This study propose gather data determine whether different treatment threshold diabetes Qatar people inherently different effect variability HbA1c month-to-month basis . By establish understanding different treatment regimen hyperglycemia may affect HbA1c variability , study would inform long term study design determine whether intervention reduce HbA1c variability reduce micro- macrovascular complication risk independently mean HbA1c . If prove , concept would allow patient help avoid glycaemia-related vascular complication without high potential risk hypoglycemia associate current gold standard diabetes care . The investigator plan recruit 150 patient glucose lowering medication ( HbA1c 7.5-9 % ) , randomize one two treatment threshold group test HbA1c every 6 week 20 visit ( visit 1 baseline ; therefore 114 week ) assess HbA1c variability group . Self-monitored fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) measurement undertaken 3 time weekly report back medical team part safety monitoring . Patients randomly divide 2 treatment threshold . In one investigator intensify treatment FPG &gt; 140mg/dl FPG &lt; 90mg/dl , use whatever treatment clinically appropriate , intensify FPG rise &gt; 140mg/dl . In group Investigators intensify FPG &gt; 115 mg/dl &lt; =115 mg/dl intensify &gt; 115 mg/dl . As study treatment threshold dependent therapy independent . This help circumvent concern drug regimen could complicate analysis present confounder . In practical term mean investigator give group patient therapy intensified accord treatment threshold addition hypoglycemic agent use routine clinical practice . Intensifying treatment dose would undertake three consecutive FPG target 140 115 mg/dl . This advised patient ring study coordinator and/or study coordinator ring patient weekly advise consultant FPG value action . It anticipate mean HbA1c comparable variability HbA1c differ 2 population . Whole blood sample take recruited patient freshly analyzed biochemical HbA1c analyzer . Following sample aliquot haemolysate store -80C 2-3 year ( duration study ) , reanalyzed completion study result compare measurement prior storage . All patient enter study assess dietician Hamad hospital advise complete food frequency questionnaire devise Arab population base EPIC . It complete every six week time HbA1c take . Patients also ask fill WHO Global Physical Activity Questionnaire ( G-PAQ ) translate Arabic collect six weekly basis . Measurement serum lipid ( total cholesterol , HDL ) , inflammatory marker ( hsCRP ) undertake every 6 week HbA1c measure . Twenty four hour urinary oxidative stress ( urinary isoprostanes LC/MS ) measure baseline , 12 24 month . These measure may provide insight mechanism HbA1c variability may alter microvascular macrovascular risk . Measures microvascular complication include include albumin/creatinine ratio eGFR undertaken every 4 month measure nephropathy . For neuropathy , autonomic function test use deep breathing heart rate variability , corneal nerve fiber density ( CNFD ) , sensitive measure small fiber neuropathy perform baseline , 12 24 month expertise Professor Malik establish technique Doha . Recruitment patient : Only Qatari patient recruit investigator aim recruit gender balance reflect local eligible diabetes patient 150 recruit age 18-65 year age . Patients treatment include insulin study aim look treatment threshold , rather actual treatment . This would mean patient might additional medication add substituted order reach necessary threshold study . Patients may suitable give information sheet detail study ask contact designate coordinator within 2 day . After informed consent follow '' HRP-803 HRP-802 INVESTIGATOR GUIDANCE - Documentation Informed Consent '' , take study coordinator , subject screen inclusion exclusion criterion eligibility . Should patient suitable inclusion study blood withdrawn HbA1c , routine biochemistry include creatinine , insulin , fast glucose , fast lipid , blood hsCRP full blood count visit . Urinary albumin/creatinine also assess . Patients would randomize point . Patients either attend clinic study coordinator visit home every 6 week take blood HbA1c , routine biochemistry include eGFR , lipid , hsCRP . Urine urinary isoprostanes take measure oxidative stress . Urinary albumin/creatinine also assess . This undertaken 20 study visit assess HbA1c variability two treatment threshold . A fasting insulin glucose take beginning , week 60 end study measure insulin resistance ( HOMA ) determine change insulin resistance course study . Sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) indirect measure insulin resistance also take event fast blood obtain . Assessment retinopathy ophthalmologist neuropathy undertaken beginning , mid point end study fit current clinical practice . Renal function determine every 6 week throughout study monitoring GFR measure urinary albumin/creatinine . Urinary isoprostanes measure use LC/MS validate assay currently use . Autonomic function test use deep breathing heart rate variability , sensitive measure small fiber neuropathy use corneal confocal microscopy quantify corneal nerve fiber density ( CNFD ) perform baseline , 12 month 24 month ( total 3 time 2 year study period ) .
