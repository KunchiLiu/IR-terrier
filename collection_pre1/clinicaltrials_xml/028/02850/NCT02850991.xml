	<brief_summary>Definitive chemoradiation standard treatment locally advanced esophageal cancer . NCCN ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network ) recommend radiation dose 50-50.4 Gy definitive radiation dose esophageal cancer definitive chemo-radiation . However , many study China show common recurrence site definitive chemo-radiation within radiation region . But large randomized clinical trial investigate optimal radiation dose concurrent chemotherapy esophageal cancer China . The purpose clinical trial investigate optimal radiation dose thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Radiation Dose With Concurrent Chemotherapy Thoracic Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine high-dose radiation concurrent chemotherapy increase overall survival thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate high-dose radiation concurrent chemotherapy increase progression-free survival thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma II.To evaluate high-dose radiation concurrent chemotherapy increase local control thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma OUTLINE : Patients randomize one two treatment arm ARM 1 : Patients receive high-dose radiation concurrent chemotherapy.High-dose RT:59.4 Gy 33 fraction , 1.8 Gy per fraction , 5days/week.concurrent chemotherapy : Paclitaxel 50mg/m2 D1+carboplatin AUC ( area curve ) =2 D1 , weekly 6 week . After , patient receive consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy 2 cycle . ARM 2 : Patients receive standard-dose radiation concurrent chemotherapy.Standard-dose RT:59.4 Gy 33 fraction , 1.8 Gy per fraction , 5days/week . Concurrent chemotherapy : Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 D1+carboplatin AUC ( area curve ) =2 D1 , weekly 6 week . After , patient receive consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy 2 cycle . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-4 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
