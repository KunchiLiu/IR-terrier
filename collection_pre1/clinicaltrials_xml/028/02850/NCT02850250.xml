	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect structural functional anomaly heart occur fetal development present birth . Congenital heart disease common congenital structural malformation . The survival child bear congenital heart disease improve dramatically past thirty year , improvement diagnosis , medical surgical management well anaesthetic care improve survival rate 20 % 80 % . Paediatric cardiac surgery Children congenital heart disease may undergo either closed open heart surgery . In closed operation , heart main blood vessel operate heart still beat . In open procedure , heart open blood flow child 's vital organ support heart-lung bypass machine ( Cardio-pulmonary bypass - CBP ) . In light improve outcomes recent year see worldwide shift towards neonatal biventricular repair possible . For repair possible majority offer surgical univentricular palliation typically require 'high-risk ' surgery first week . 'High risk ' neonate undergo cardiac surgery often spend prolonged period intensive care require maximal support . These patient intensive care unit suffer multi-organ failure due variety reason may require cardiovascular respiratory support , also renal replacement therapy form peritoneal dialysis haemodialysis/filtration . As result organ failure/support different cardiac anatomy physiology , pharmacokinetics drug use post-operative period could potentially vary greatly . Post-operative surgical site infection Post operative wound infection paediatric patient undergo cardiothoracic surgery occur 2.3 % 8 % patient . This complication result increase morbidity , long hospitalisation increase cost . A major strategy reduce postoperative surgical site infection use perioperative antibiotic reduce primarily gram-positive skin flora colonise skin potentially infect open wound . Of particular concern patient undergo cardiac surgery deep sternal wound infection mediastinitis . Associated mortality significant report high 60 % adult although little comparable data child . Neonates high risk post-operative sternal wound infection , incidence 5.5 % versus 0.5 % old child one study , also highlight increased morbidity mortality neonatal group . Audit data institution clarify child age less 3 month time surgery high risk develop post-operative surgical site infection , commonly isolate organism Staphylococcus Aureus . Cefuroxime preferred choice antibiotic prophylaxis Alder Hey Children 's Hospital . It give intra-operatively , post operatively 24hours post , unless patient 's chest remain open , case cefuroxime continue chest close , change another anti-microbial . Pharmacokinetics drug paediatric patient undergo cardiac surgery Pharmacokinetics discipline aim predict best dosage dose regimen single drug order ensure maintain therapeutically effective concentration action site . In postoperative cardiac patient critical care , number pathophysiological iatrogenic condition may significantly alter pharmacokinetic behavior drug . These include - - age - weight - temperature ( patient actively cool ) - single/biventricular circulation - acute kidney injury - passive peritoneal drainage - active peritoneal dialysis - continuous veno-venous haemofiltration/dialysis - extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation There research available paediatric patient undergo cardiac surgery cardio-pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) may sub-therapeutic cefuroxime level dose cefuroxime adjust accordingly . In post op paediatric cardiac patient number study describe different drug pharmacokinetics : Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics may influence age within neonatal period , weight , total bypass time , presence intracardiac shunt . Lower bodyweight associate low epinephrine clearance . Milrinone clearance also appear increase age . Phenobarbital pharmacokinetics also influence age weight . Subjects single ventricle physiology demonstrate 15 % decrease clearance compare subject two-ventricle physiology . So far date , pharmacokinetic study investigate cefuroxime specific post-operative patient population . Moreover , variation extracellular fluid content response trauma surgery fluid load significant drug loss thoracic drainages PD catheter may significantly lower plasma concentration extracellularly distribute hydrophilic antimicrobial ( beta-lactams , aminoglycosides glycopeptides ) . Instability renal function may promote significant change body fluid concentration renally eliminate drug , even brief period hour . These factor cumulatively may lead reduce increased exposure drug . Dosages medicine generally reduce paediatric population follow cardiac surgery account potential AKI ( e.g . prophylactic antimicrobial ) , however potential loss PD dialysis free drainage via PD catheter usually consider . Passive Peritoneal Drainage/Peritoneal dialysis follow paediatric cardiac surgery Children undergoing surgery congenital heart disease especially prone acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . It difficult appreciate true incidence complication , throughout literature available , great variability see criterion use diagnosis . The reported incidence range 1 % 17 % , depend largely criterion use define condition , associate mortality 21 % 70 % . Peritoneal dialysis commonly use post-operative period cardiac surgery aid removal fluid sometimes treatment modality acute kidney injury . It routine clinical practice many center , include ( Department Cardiac Surgery Alder Hey Children 's Hospital ) insert peritoneal dialysis catheter electively time surgery potential peritoneal dialysis neonates child undergo bypass surgery deem significant risk need post-operative PD . Following elective insertion PD catheter , hourly fluid drainage document part routine ICU fluid balance chart . The vast majority drain fluid catheter initial hour . AKI usually develop early PD usually prescribe first day operation . Between January 2014 March 2015 , 420 child underwent cardiac surgery Alder Hey child 's Hospital . Of patient , 4 % require PD post-operative period . ECMO Occasionally patient unable wean cardiopulmonary bypass follow surgery , deteriorate arrival intensive care require Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) . This group patient increase volume distribution therefore , alter pharmacokinetic change .</detailed_description>
