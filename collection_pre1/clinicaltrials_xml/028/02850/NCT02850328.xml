	<detailed_description>The finding water immersion indicate motor task , plantarflexion ( 25 ) , others , leg-press ( 7 ) , appear affect . Thus , would relevant test number motor task body region . On hand , parabolic flight require methodology perform quick efficient fashion . Hence , propose examine ankle plantarflexion , leg-press grip-force . Our primary hypothesis plantarflexion MVC reduce microgravity phase parabolic flight . As secondary parameter assess parameter muscle function easily implement parabolic flight , electromyography ultrasound measurement musculotendinous unit . To assess muscular system deeply , plantarflexion also perform superimpose twitch ( 16 ) MVC rest . An additional experimental condition place foam ( unstable surface ; standard size ) foot plantarflexion include . This approach increase challenge neuromuscular control system , condition , MVC reduce ( 29 ) . These secondary investigation , prohibitively complicate practical implementation project , help understand happen musculature indeed find impediment muscle force generation microgravity . The aim study evaluate applicability high-load resistance training countermeasure long term space flight , current project two scientific goal . The main objective perform deep examination muscle function MVC weightlessness ( parabolic flight ) . The secondary objective gather insight underlie mechanism structure base investigation target neuromuscular musculotendinous system interaction . The main judgment criterion MVC test three different task : ( 1 ) leg press , ( 2 ) plantarflexion ( 3 ) grip strength . As secondary criterion , ass parameter muscle function easily implement parabolic flight : - Rate force development - Electromyographic activity - Ultrasound measure : fascicle length pennation angle gastrocnemius medialis muscle - Superimposed twitch torque ( M-waves rest V-waves MVC condition ) - Maximum voluntary activation capacity ( % VA ) : % VA = ( 1- [ torque superimpose twitch/torque rest twitch ] ) *100 % . Our primary hypothesis plantarflexion knee extension force generation capacity reduce , grip-force , microgravity phase parabolic flight .</detailed_description>
