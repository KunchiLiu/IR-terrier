	<brief_summary>Background : Patients spinal cord injury ( SCI ) high prevalence cardiovascular disease compare healthy population . Aerobic exercise train one recommended treatment . However , literature regard effect aerobic training patient SCI scarce . This study evaluate change parameter exercise physiology serum myokines immediately exercise train program among patient SCI . Method : Male patient SCI age- sex-matched healthy individual recruit . Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) use determine oxygen uptake peak exercise anaerobic threshold group . The patient SCI attend aerobic exercise training 36 session within 12-16 week . Basic data , hemodynamic exercise physiology parameter , serum myokine ( myostatin , insulin like growth factor , follistatin ) concentration measure pre- post-exercise group , repeat patient SCI post-training .</brief_summary>
