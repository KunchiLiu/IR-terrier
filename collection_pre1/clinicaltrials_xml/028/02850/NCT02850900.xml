	<detailed_description>Psoriasis common , chronic inflammatory disease major impact patient ' quality life . Patients ' response treatment variable . Poor adherence topical , oral biologic psoriasis treatment common may account poor responses.1 , 2 Many psoriasis patient even fill prescriptions.3 Electronic monitoring adherence provide detailed accurate way assess adherence . While study use electronic monitor assess adherence topical psoriasis treatment biologics , adherence oral psoriasis treatment well characterize . Understanding adherence oral psoriasis treatment critical , therapeutic window treatment narrow psoriasis treatment option , make adherence recommend dose critical . Developing method improve psoriasis patient ' adherence potential provide immediate , practical mean improve patient ' treatment outcome . Return visit improve patient ' use medication &amp; treatment outcomes practical add additional cost patient medical system . Having patient report treatment experience without office visit offer promise improve adherence test psoriasis population . The primary hypothesis investigator study adherence oral psoriasis treatment poor report intervention may improve adherence oral psoriasis treatment . The Specific Aims study : 1 . To determine adherence oral psoriasis treatment ( methotrexate ) electronic monitor . 2 . To assess relationship adherence psoriasis outcome ( measure body surface area [ BSA ] , Physician Global Assessment [ PGA ] [ BSA ] x [ PGA ] ) . 3 . To identify factor associate adherence oral psoriasis treatment , include physician trust , confidence treatment plan , depression measure Wake Forest University Physician Trust Scale ( WFUPTS ) ,4-6 Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) ,7 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) . 4 . To test obtain preliminary data impact Internet-reporting measure patient ' adherence oral psoriasis treatment . The investigator propose investigator-blinded , 6-month prospective study 40 patient age 12 old prescribe oral psoriasis treatment . Adherence assess use Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS® ) cap , electronic monitor affix medication container . Investigators subject blind adherence data final ( Month 6 ) treatment visit . This study high significance , provide critically important information patient use oral psoriasis treatment , well foundation develop implement intervention trial improve adherence outcome patient treat oral psoriasis treatment . Innovations study include seek change paradigm investigator understanding role adherence oral psoriasis treatment , include effect treatment failure side effect , develop new understanding role physician medication trust adherence , potentially change time method clinical assessment psoriasis ( ) patient light effect time method clinical assessment treatment adherence outcome . The use objective electronic adherence monitor well-validated assessment tool add strength approach study ; another strength approach careful attention research ethic adherence monitoring . The environment study particularly strong , facility extensive experience aspect adherence monitor research . The overall goal study well understand improve adherence behavior patient psoriasis , common , chronic , relapse , inflammatory disease . Psoriasis reduce patient ' quality life , yet patient psoriasis , chronic disease , frequently misuse medicine , impair effectiveness prescribe therapy ( underused ) increase risk treatment ( overuse mistime ) .8 Poor adherence treatment misconstrue poor response , lead unnecessary treatment escalation result expose patient toxic costly medications.9 In many case , non-adherence , rather non-response , underlying precursor treatment failure.10 , 11 Adherence issue oral psoriasis treatment largely unexplored critical importance . Oral methotrexate widely use ( encouraged payors ) , yet risky , narrow therapeutic window biologics . Other oral agent approve psoriasis include cyclosporine ( risk renal disease ) apremilast ( associate gastrointestinal tolerability issue ) . While large database study find oral psoriasis treatment underused , variation use oral psoriasis treatment among patient critically important define . Traditional method measure medical adherence tend unreliable . Assessment method patient interview , questionnaire , survey , diary deliver inconsistent data depend upon patient 's willingness accurately record medication use ability remember . Electronic monitoring device offer effective mean objective adherence monitoring . Medication Event Monitoring System cap ( MEMS® , AARDEX Corp. , Fremont , CA ) include microprocessor bottle cap standard medication bottle record time date bottle open interval since last bottle opening.12 The availability accurate electronic adherence measurement provide foundation study novel way improve adherence . In several study psoriasis inflammatory skin disease , clear pattern improve adherence around time office visit evident . The tendency patient adherent around time office visit may form general tendency adherent interact healthcare system assess treatment outcome , form `` white coat compliance '' Hawthorne effect . A pilot study adolescent acne vulgaris test whether adherence topical benzoyl peroxide could improve weekly online-reporting treatment experience .</detailed_description>
