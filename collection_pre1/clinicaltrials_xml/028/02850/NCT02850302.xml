	<brief_summary>Breast cancer major public health problem . In France , lead cause cancer death woman . According National Cancer Institute ( INCA ) , approximately 49,000 new case diagnosed 2012 France . It heterogeneous disease , comprise plurality entity whose clinical behavior , biological prognosis differ . Amongst entity , breast cancer triple negative ( TN ) define absence expression estrogen receptor progesterone absence overexpression HER2 oncoprotein . It represent 15 % breast cancer occur frequently young woman . This proliferative tumor phenotype metastatic potential . Because genomic heterogeneity lack recurrent identify molecular target , target therapy today show benefit term survival compare conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy , partly explain poor prognosis tumor phenotype . The positron emission tomography ( PET ) 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) molecular image test identify first second neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment non-responder patient treatment low probability pathologic complete response ( pCR ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy . For two FDG-PET examination perform ; ) pretreatment PET b ) control PET one two treatment . The objective pilot , single-center , prospective study preliminary identification recurrent genomic alteration among triple-negative tumor early chemoresistance , identify PET first cycle neoadjuvant therapy .</brief_summary>
