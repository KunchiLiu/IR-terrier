	<detailed_description>Background The process age cause progressive decline functional capacity . Maintaining physical fitness appear important factor fight frailty ( 40 % frailty people &gt; 65 year old ) , condition cause loss independence clinically reversible . Fragility condition associate : slow walk speed , sedentary lifestyle , weight loss , muscle weakness low energy level . It therefore correlate physical performance . Purpose A number study demonstrate benefit physical activity frail old people . Levels adherence physical activity program well know low adherence decrease positive effect intervention . It seem therefore interesting suggest another approach integrate innovative technology ( plate-forme Hu360® ) improve clinical condition frail old person , well level adherence . Abstract Highly diversified program physical activity old people show effectiveness term improve functional capacity . Only one program , date , use motorize platform . The motorized platform allow use sensorimotor program adapt population . Thus , user , combination motor sensory capacity necessary actively control different position well reaction maintain balance stimulate , important psychomotor capability maintain autonomy fight lose independence . Demonstration effectiveness type equipment would propose new modality physical activity adapt population . Use new equipment could allow possibility standardize activity , whilst continue individualize physical activity program . Two phase group ( Intervention/Control ) : Phase 1 ( day 0 - week 6 ) : 2x1 hour session per week use Hu360® ( Intervention group ) adapt physical activity program ( Control group ) supervision therapist adapt program accord progress patient , follow standardized procedure ( exercise : postural/balance training , strength training legs/trunk coordination endurance activity ) Phase 2 ( week 6 - month 6 ) : Physical activity program home group , perform independently . Blinded evaluation perform 6 week 6 month group . The investigator hypothesis use motorize platform allow superior physical performance compare traditional physical activity program . Statistical analysis Data analysis realize , blind treatment group . The analysis conduct intention treat . The principal analysis make use linear mixed model repeat data , take account stratification factor ( gender class Score SPPB baseline ) random effect , without imputation miss data . An exploratory analysis conduct principal outcome measure use linear mixed model repeat data , take account stratification factor covariates may change effect intervention , compliance . Secondary outcome measure analyse similar manner generalize linear mixed model . The test bilateral . An error-correction modem 5 % consider analysis .</detailed_description>
