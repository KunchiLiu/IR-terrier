	<brief_summary>The objective study test effect healthy diet &amp; walking ( Controls ) compare healthy diet , walking , balance/strength exercise ( Intervention ) muscle density two population : elderly individual obese individual . The intervention 3 month length . During time , Control Intervention group meet one time week educational session healthy diet strategy participate group walk Control group group exercise Intervention group . The Control group ask walk additional 4 time per week ( 5 time total ) least 10 minutes/day start study build 30 minutes/day 3-month time point . The Intervention group walk two time per week use criterion , addition balance/strength exercise total three day per week . Measurements make baseline , intervention completion ( 3 month ) follow-up ( 6 month -3 month completion intervention ) . At 3 month , control group invite add balance/strength exercise . The hypothesis add balance &amp; strength exercise healthy diet plan increase muscle density ( decrease fat infiltration ) improve muscle function elderly obese population . Increases muscle density expect show great improvement muscle function elderly population , speculate great improvement metabolic measure show obese population . Participants intervention group great reduction fall less hospital , ER &amp; clinic visit compare control group , group improve quality life , positive change eat behavior , decrease perceived stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia , loss skeletal lean mass muscle strength , occur elderly also may present obese individual due fat infiltration muscle . Loss lean mass along fat infiltration skeletal muscle cause decrease muscle density , contribute decline muscle function . Increases muscle density expect improve muscle function well metabolic function . This study test effect healthy diet &amp; walking ( Controls ) compare healthy diet , walking , balance/strength exercise ( Intervention ) muscle density two population : elderly individual obese individual . The intervention 3 month length . The Control group walk 5 time per week least 10 minutes/day start study build 30 minutes/day 3-month time point . The Intervention group walk two time per week use criterion , addition balance/strength exercise three day per week . At 3 month , control group invite add balance/strength exercise . Study visit baseline , intervention completion ( 3 month ) , follow-up ( 6 month -3 month completion intervention ) include : questionnaire ; anthropometric measure , body composition , muscle density trabecular bone measure ; muscle function strength test ; activity measure ; diet recall ; metabolic measure ( waist circumference , blood pressure , fast blood sugar , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol ) ; erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( see Outcome Measures detailed measure ) . Healthy Diet Education Sessions : USDA 's MyPlate , introduce 2010 , new guideline proper dietary nutrition . These guideline , develop USDA conjunction Department Health Human Services design serve `` cornerstone Federal nutrition policy nutrition education activity '' ( USDA Dietary Guidelines , 2011 ) . Each week participant attend healthy diet education session base MyPlate Dietary Guidelines . Dr. Holm oversee lesson develop implement SDSU Health Nutritional Sciences student . Twelve lesson give cycle 3 month period matter participant enters study , twelve session complete go study program . Focus session topic portion size , read food label , calorie intake burning , tip grocery shopping , healthy recipe , food group , healthy fat , carbohydrate protein , etc . Each lesson take approximately 20 minute group activity session follow . Exercise Interventions : Control Group - The exercise intervention control group walk . Walking expect complete 5 day per week do participant 's physical ability/pace . At start study , participant complete least 10 minute per day accord physical ability . By end study , expect increase 30 minute walk day complete 10-minute interval throughout day . One day per week , control group participant invite 'group walk ' day week follow dietary education lesson . Participants keep weekly walk log record time walk day purpose exercise , part daily activity . Weekly log collect new one issue week dietary education lesson . Exercise compliance calculate use log . Intervention Group - The intervention group walk describe , two day per week . Three day per week , exercise focus strength balance complete ( see Five Esslinger Exercises Strength Balance ) . These exercise complete one bout , spread throughout day . Participants give weekly log record walk exercise activity similar control group describe . Participants instruct study personnel include South Dakota State University Health Nutritional Science student properly exercise level ability focus modification ensure safety prevent injury fall . One day per week , intervention group invite 'group exercise session ' follow dietary education lesson . South Dakota State University Health Nutritional Science student assist teach proper form safety measure perform exercise assist group session .</detailed_description>
