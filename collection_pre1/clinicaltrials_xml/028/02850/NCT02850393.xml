	<brief_summary>Mental-health condition affect million people worldwide . The economic burden mental illness enormous economic health develop develop nation depend control stagger growth cost mental disorder . Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) relatively common frequent form anxiety affect approximately 2-3 % population . OCD characterize anxiety , obsession ( persistent intrusive thought image highly distress content ) compulsion ( repetitive activity ) , severely impairs life affect . Despite interest effective affordable care rehabilitation , cognitive therapeutic profit little increase accumulation knowledge neuroscience , neuroscientist pay little attention challenge face clinical psychologist psychiatrist . To reduce cultural gap , two team specialize study multimodal image healthy participant clinical patient mental health disorder , UMR-S INSERM-EPHE-UNICAEN U1077 unit lead Francis Eustache , ISTS team ( UMR-S 6301 CNRS-CEA-UCBN ) lead Sonia Dollfus , joint effort develop integrated approach neural mechanism stake basic neuroscience use state-of-art neuroimaging technique , novel ground break psychological intervention . Both team evolve brain imaging Cyceron center Caen connection Mental Health Addictology Center , offer unique opportunity translational research . This project capitalize recent evidence show healthy participant prevent unwanted image enter consciousness use inhibitory control memory suppression technique , disrupt trace memory sensory area brain , weaken vividness later reentrance . OCD characterize aberrant excessive visual intrusion , usually extremely vivid , detailed , unpleasant . These distressing image particularly uncontrollable may frequently initiate compulsive ritual . In first phase proposal use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) develop neurobiological model cognitive computation achieve inhibition network suppress memory . To achieve goal develop attentional model healthy memory inhibition functioning , simulate deployment attentional resource different mental process stake suppression . Using sophisticated analyzing tool fMRI data , use model decode infer representational content brain inhibition network , refine connectivity pathways underlie control . The lack strong neurobiological model prevents development therapy would increase functionality network optimize intervention aim disrupt mental intrusion obsession . In second phase , ass whether memory suppression may transfer trained OCD patient use image depict obsession , promise avenue reduce symptom long run . In addition , fMRI brain structural acquisition collect cognitive training memory suppression , offer unique opportunity observe online dysfunction intrusion control OCD patient identify neurobiological marker predictive training outcome network reconfiguration training . A fundamental goal motivate forget involves exclude unwelcome content consciousness also reduce later emotional impact . In parallel two main phase , thus also measure physiological marker autonomic nervous system activity change response suppress image well identify consequence memory suppression emotional state , anxiety , mental health general .</brief_summary>
