	<detailed_description>Open-label , non-randomized , two-stage , multi-center study evaluate clinical efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamic effect PQR309 patient progressive glioblastoma standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy . The first stage study enroll minimum 18 patient glioblastoma first progression temozolomide chemoradiotherapy temozolomide . Following completion recruitment patient first stage study , decision make study team ( study investigator sponsor ) , base continuous evaluation safety efficacy data , whether continue recruitment patient second stage await data analysis . 17 additional patient may enrol second stage study , minimum 35 patient total . All patient evaluable primary endpoint follow disease progression death .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm glioblastoma first progression follow standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy ( TMZ/RTTMZ ) 2. old 18 year age 3 . Radiographic demonstration disease progression RANO criterion 4 . Only patient surgical cohort : Eligible open resection progressive tumor accord standard practice study center Availability adequate surgical tissue sample evaluation concentration PQR309 tumor PD effect Patients treat PQR309 incomplete surgical resection may still measurable disease accord RANO criterion may therefore evaluable evaluation response treatment PQR309 accord RANO criterion . The best response patient treat PQR309 complete surgical resection stable disease . All patient assess PFS6 . 5 . Only patient nonsurgical cohort : Presence least one lesion bidimensionally measurable disease MRI contrastenhancing tumor least 1 cm ( 10 mm ) long diameter baseline MRI require patient undergo surgery relapse . For patient undergo surgery recurrence participate presurgical PQR309 dose cohort , rule regard response assessment surgical cohort apply . All patient assess PFS6 . 6 . Patient must least 1 formalinfixed paraffinembedded archival tumor tissue block representative glioblastoma available first surgical resection glioblastoma . 7 . One prior systemic therapy regimen : patient must receive least one dose TMZ first line therapy . More 6 cycle alternative dose regiment TMZ allow . 8 . If receiving corticosteroid , patient must stable decrease dose corticosteroid 8 mg dexamethasone equivalent ≥ 5 day prior baseline MRI . 9 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) &gt; 70 % . 10 . More 12 week radiotherapy ( RT ) 11 . More 4 week last administration TMZ 12 . More 4 week investigational agent ( judgment investigator agreement lead investigator PIQUR ) 13 . Adequate hematological , liver renal function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5x109/l , platelet ≥ 100x109/l , hemoglobin ≥ 100g/L . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time ULN Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN 14 . Able willing swallow retain oral medication 15 . Female male patient reproductive potential must agree use effective contraception screen 90 day discontinue study treatment* 16 . Willing able sign inform consent comply protocol duration study 1 . Second later glioblastoma relapse 2 . Received one systemic treatment regimen glioblastoma 3 . Patients receive enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAED ) within 7 day first dose PQR309 4 . Patient take drug know risk promote QT prolongation Torsades de Pointes . 5 . Patient currently use herbal preparation medication . Patient stop use herbal medication 7 day prior first dose study drug 6 . Patients glioblastoma know contain IDH1 2 mutation 7 . Other concomitant antitumor therapy determine study team 8 . Prior treatment intracerebral agent , e.g . prolifeprospan 20 carmustine wafer 9 . Patients unable undergo contrastenhanced MRI 10 . Fasting glucose &gt; 7.0 mmol/L HbA1c &gt; 6.4 % . 11 . Medically documented history active major depressive episode , bipolar disorder ( I II ) , obsessivecompulsive disorder , schizophrenia , history suicidal attempt ideation , homicidal ideation ( e.g . risk harm self others ) , patient active severe personality disorder . 12 . Anxiety ≥CTC AE grade 3 13 . Patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include limited , ongoing active infection , know HIV infection , chronic liver disease , chronic renal disease , pancreatitis , chronic pulmonary disease , active cardiac disease cardiac dysfunction , interstitial lung disease , active autoimmune disease , uncontrolled diabetes , neuropsychiatric social situation would limit compliance study requirement 14 . Presence gastrointestinal disease condition could interfere significantly absorption study drug . 15 . Concomitant treatment medicinal product increase pH ( reduce acidity ) upper gastrointestinal tract , include , limited , protonpump inhibitor ( e.g . omeprazole ) , H2antagonists ( e.g . ranitidine ) antacid . Patients may enrol study washout period sufficient terminate effect ( See section 11.2.2.8 ) .Women pregnant breast feeding , 16 .
