	<brief_title>SVS VQI TransCarotid Revascularization Surveillance Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Contemporary randomize trial transfemoral carotid artery stenting ( TF CAS ) carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) show comparable long-term ipsilateral stroke prevention ( &gt; 30 day ) consistently demonstrate high periprocedural ( &lt; 30 day ) stroke rate , include contralateral stroke , compare CEA , high risk center around `` day zero '' . Potential etiology excess risk likely relate embolization unprotected catheterization aortic arch supraaortic vessel TF approach and/or suboptimal distal embolic protection CAS . TransCarotid Artery Revascularization ( TCAR ) combine surgical principle neuroprotection minimally invasive endovascular technique treat stenosis carotid artery . It involve surgical exposure clamp proximal common carotid artery continuous carotid blood flow reversal via extracorporeal arteriovenous shunt target carotid artery femoral vein , carotid bifurcation/internal carotid artery stenting perform . Thus , TCAR avoid catheter manipulation aortic arch emulate `` clamp backbleed '' method neuroprotection CEA , differs CEA carotid artery access small , supra-clavicular incision main plexus cranial nerve . Further , direct transcarotid approach allow use large bore sheath tube achieve high reverse carotid artery flow rate possible small transfemoral catheter . Published TCAR Data : The initial study TCAR patient deem high risk complication CEA show TCAR appear provide superior stroke death outcome compare prior registry result CEA TF CAS . Schermerhorn , et al report outcome Society Vascular Surgery ( SVS ) Vascular Registry high surgical risk patient find real world registry , 30-day stroke death rate symptomatic patient CEA TF CAS 6.4 % 7.9 % respectively . ( Citation : Schermerhorn ) In asymptomatic , high risk patient , 30-day stroke death rate CEA TF CAS 3.7 % 4.8 % respectively . In contrast , recent study TCAR ( ROADSTER pivotal trial ) , 30-day stroke death rate symptomatic asymptomatic patient 2.8 % 2.9 % , respectively . ( Citation : Kwolek ) While initial result TCAR encouraging , involve 114 patient pivotal trial , evaluation clearly important . Objective : The objective VQI TransCarotid Artery Revascularization Surveillance Project evaluate safety effectiveness TCAR real world practice , use contemporaneous comparison CEA . Stroke death outcome data TCAR CEA patient deem high risk complication CEA collect analyzed use SVS PSO CAS CEA Registries . High surgical risk define accord CMS criterion publish National Coverage Determination Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( 20.7 ) list inclusion criterion . The evaluation alternate strategy surgical treatment carotid artery disease central mission SVS PSO . Methods : All high surgical risk patient treat TCAR CEA SVS PSO CAS CEA Registries include separately analyze symptomatic asymptomatic , symptomatic define history ipsilateral stroke , TIA and/or amaurosis fugax within 180 day procedure . 30-day one-year outcome analyze propensity match , risk adjust cohort . Any FDA-cleared proximal embolic protection device FDA-approved carotid artery stent system indicate transcarotid approach include registry . Sites participate VQI audit consecutive case submission comparison claim data . A Steering Committee within SVS PSO monitor quality completeness submit data , adjudicate questionable outcome query site clarify information . This committee responsible scientific analysis periodic publication result .</detailed_description>
