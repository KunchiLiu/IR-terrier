The TD child complete EEG testing , ASD child parent complete outcome assessment . In addition outcome measure list Brief Summary , child administer Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales ( Vineland - II ) , Mullen Scales Early Learning , Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale - II ( one administer within past 12 month ) sample description . During EEG session , brain activity theory mind social stimulus use measure brain behavior relationship . The recording adhere standard clinical EEG procedure , use high density EEG provide high spatial resolution electrical source image brain space . They conduct Registered EEG Technologist ( R. EEG T ) specially trained student assistant . The procedure involve first explain parent child do . The participant sit within chair parent 's lap EEG record . The EEG task consist follow : First child ask open close eye minute record baseline rest EEG . Then auditory sound ( intonation word component ) image social stimulus embed fun cartoon stimulus maintain child 's attention display screen . The picture consist eye movement , facial gesture , point light diagram body movement . The process drama program conduct 6 child ASD 6 TD peer model 5 day per week 1 week 2.5-3 hour day .

We also examine behavior peer model identify area research team may need change good engage peer model subsequent session . After end process drama intervention , participant ASD repeat baseline assessment within 4 week intervention end . The assessment repeat ToMT , CSBS , SPA SSiS . The child ASD also complete another EEG session baseline . Three month last testing session , parent contact complete interview ask child function related play interaction child adult . These interview may occur face-to-face mutually agree upon location , could phone , could via video conferencing system , Business Skype . The interview audio-recorded later thematic analysis . After theme identify , parent re-contacted show identified theme make sure accurately represent intend convey ( member checking ) .</detailed_description>
