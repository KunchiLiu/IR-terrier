	<detailed_description>Patients dual-mode group underwent five consecutive daily session dual-mode NIBS simultaneous high-frequency rTMS tDCS , whereas patient rTMS group underwent high-frequency rTMS sham tDCS . Assessments FOG , motor , ambulatory cognitive function perform three time : baseline NIBS , immediately NIBS , one week cessation NIBS .</detailed_description>
