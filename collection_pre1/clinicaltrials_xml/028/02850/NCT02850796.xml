Moreover , intervention aim act specifically patient ' self-criticism experiential avoidance pattern order reduce weight-self-stigma promote healthy behaviours quality-of-life .

This study investigate impact change several psychological process different obesity dimension , body mass biochemical parameter associate health risk , eat behaviour , stigma , health quality life . The Kg-FREE intervention enclose 10 weekly group session ( 2 , 5 hours/ ) , highly experiential follow two 2 booster fortnightly session . The intervention divide several module , apply structured way : ) psycho education relate eat physical exercise healthy habit ; b ) brain work relate eat weight ; c ) Life value identification enhance intrinsic motivation ; ) cognitive fusion experiential avoidance maladaptive strategy underlie psychological suffering , negative affect ( e.g . shame ) self-criticism ; e ) mindfulness exercise adaptive strategy emotional regulation ; f ) development self-compassion antidote shame self-criticism , activate soothe system deactivate threat system . Kg-Free session carry clinical psychologist previous train contextual-behavioral therapy one clinical psychology master student . The intervention protocol build upon pre-existent ACT mindfulness-based protocol people eat weight issue ( e.g. , Forman et al. , 2013 ; Kristeller &amp; Wolever , 2011 ; Lillis et al. , 2009 ; Tapper et al. , 2009 ) . Additionally , recognize importance integrate compassion behavioural intervention ( e.g. , Luoma &amp; Platt , 2015 ) , specially deal shame self-criticism ( Gilbert , 2010 ) compassion component add . This component aim training participant develop accept kind relationship , particularly thing go wrong facing error failure . All session follow basic structure , start 30 minute share experience , follow five-minute mindfulness practice . Then session content deliver , follow eating mindfulness practice train ability pay attention food eat physical sensation . Finally , session content briefly revise practice week establish ( e.g. , mindfulness compassion exercise ) . A participant ' manual provide , include targeted construct , example exercise sheet . Audio file give participant ensure practice mindfulness compassion exercise session . Moreover , Portuguese therapist manual also assemble available upon request . Previously data collection , ethical approval obtain Clinical Trials Unit Coimbra 's University Hospital . Participants adult woman , age 18 55 year old , overweight obesity ( BMI ≥ 25 ) without binge-eating , enrol nutritional treatment weight loss primary care unit Hospitals Coimbra 's district , Portugal . Participants recruit directly medical care unit day appointment . Participants inform voluntary confidential nature data . Also , brief overview treatment program present participant require sign inform consent . In order assure confidentiality numerical unique code assign participant . After eligibility assessment , participant meet inclusion criterion randomly assign one two study condition - experimental group receive Kg-Free intervention control group maintain Treatment usual ( consisted dietary physical activity support ) , use use computer-based random allocation . The study follow principle treatment receive . The study comprise four different assessment moment ( M0 , M1 , M2 e M3 ) , namely intervention ( M0 ) , end intervention ( M1 ) two follow-up moment three ( M2 ) six month ( M3 ) intervention . In assessment data regard participant ' biochemical ( lipid profile ) body mass parameter , eat behaviour , health , stigma quality life well psychological process collect . Regarding biochemical data , blood sample collect analysed clinical analysis laboratory Pharmacy department . Confidentiality assure hence research code participant provide laboratory . All participant weight street clothes ( without shoe ) use Body Composition Analyzer ( Tanita TBF-300 ) accurate 0.1kg . Waist circumference measure use tape measure umbilicus . The remain data collection carry clinical psychologist research team ( blind participant 's treatment condition ) . Statistical analysis All data analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS , V.20 ) alpha level set .05 . Independent sample test use order compare intervention control group baseline . Power analysis ANCOVA calculate priori . Using significance level p &lt; .05 power 80 % , sample size 31 per group ( N = 62 ) need detect standardized effect size f = 0.40 . To test between-group difference post-treatment ANCOVA baseline covariate condition fix factor perform . Paired sample t-tests perform explore within-group difference pre post test , group separately . All effect size calculate use Cohen 's d. In second study , Repeated Measures ANOVA perform test difference pre-treatment , post- treatment 3month follow-up assessment participant 's complete Kg-Free intervention ( N = 53 ) . Whenever sphericity assumption violate , Greenhouse-Geisser correction use produce valid F-ratio . Post-Hoc analyse use Bonferroni adjustment multiple comparison use explore pairwise difference ( pre-to-post treatment ; pre-to-3 month post-to-3 month ) . Effect size calculate use partial eta square ( ƞ2 ) . Finally , explore psychological process underlie change health weight eating-related outcome Kg-Free intervention MEMORE macro ( Mediation Moderation analysis Repeated measure design ) use . MEMORE allow estimation total , direct , indirect effect independent variable ( X ) dependent variable ( Y ) one mediator ( M ) simultaneously two-occasion within-subjects design .</detailed_description>
