	<brief_title>Comparing Constraint-Induced Therapy Occupation-Based Intervention Optimal Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate change motor performance extent neuroplastic change associate occupation-based intervention modify constraint-Induced therapy ( m-CIT ) recovery upper extremity motor function follow stroke . Transcranial Magnetic Imaging ( TMS ) use compare difference brain reorganization client intervention identify technique effective change brain function . Central Hypothesis : Stroke subject motor deficit receive occupation-based intervention demonstrate improve motor function great subject receive m-CIT intervention . Sixteen participant chronic stroke recruit study age 21 . Participants randomly assign one two therapy group receive 55 minute therapy 2 time per week 4 week total 8 session .</detailed_description>
