	<detailed_description>1 . - INTRODUCTION Tinnitus one prevalent symptom cause disability patient temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . According various study , incidence varies 19-69 % , 2:1 ratio woman men , high Western industrialize country . Frequent conjunction TMJ problem tinnitus lead propose existence link two clinical entity . However , mechanism link TMD otologic symptom unknown . The present study postulate association base anatomical relationship TMJ inner ear . The ligament inner ear bone close TMJ ligaments movement mandibular condyle may influence . The discomallear ligament ( DML ) anterior mallear ligament ( AML ) consider intrinsic ligament TMJ . TMJ blood supply depend tympanic auricular artery , innervation involve nerve branch masseter , lateral temporal/ internal pterygoid , key muscle condylar movement ( open close mouth lateral movement ) . The hypothesis support link TMJ tinnitus force movement mandibular condyle produce ligament stretch muscle tension , cause otologic problem tinnitus . Tinnitus define perception sound exist environment . It often describe `` buzz , beep , noise '' . Most conservative treatment tinnitus focused pharmacological treatment ( particularly antidepressant ) , cognitive-behavioral treatment , medical low strength laser therapy , acupuncture , cranial magnetic stimulation , music therapy environmental sound reduction technology . However , controversial evidence effectiveness technique give heterogeneity protocol response variable . Is understood TMJ pathology , organic functional nosological entity affect craneomandibular system relationship . They encompass large number disorder , traumatic , neoplastic , autoimmune infectious , also derive dysfunctional alteration internal structure , muscle joint . TMJ disorder myofascial joint dysfunction origin whose origin myofascial muscle disorder joint mechanical cause . Myofascial trigger point pain , describe Travell Simons , correspond noninflammatory regional muscle pathology occur striate muscle body . Its main feature presence hypersensitive area call trigger point , present palpable taut band muscle tissue ability refer pain distant area . Joint dysfunction define one occur abnormal relationship joint disk condyle , fossa TMJ eminence . Many treatment apply TMJ vary degree evidence : prevention bad habit parafunctions ; contract/relax muscle mental exercise ; heat / cold pain contracture area ; physiotherapy ; psychotherapy ; biofeedback techniques self-relaxation procedure ; rest splint , muscle discharge recapture ; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ultrasound drug treatment : NSAIDs , analgesic , anxiolytic , hypnotic , muscle relaxant antidepressant . In case , physiotherapy patient TMD focus myofascial treatment massage , present , manual therapy ( pain control improve joint movement ) . All , usually combine splint bite plate ( pain control , bruxism improve occlusion ) , although little evidence support use . In relation myofascial therapy , massage apply masticatory muscle , protocol manual therapy TMJ , well mobilization manipulation technique upper cervical spine , wide proven evidence improvement occur pain , mouth maximum mouth opening pressure pain threshold patient TMD ; although systematic review manual therapy technique present controversial evidence , give heterogeneity study . In literature review make , found paper issue proposal treatment protocol TMJ presenting among main objective control intensity TMJ pain decrease disability tinnitus produce . Only one find study proposes treatment reduce intensity TMJ pain improve disability tinnitus produce use bite splint , without perform manual intervention therapy exercise . The purpose present study raise proposal treatment manual therapy exercise aim reduce disability cause tinnitus intensity pain disability cause TMD . 2 . - JUSTIFICATION Tinnitus one prevalent symptom cause disability patient temporomandibular dysfunction ( TMD ) . The frequency concur problem temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) tinnitus , lead propose existence association two clinical entity . The present study postulate possible link develop anatomical-pathophysiological hypothesis base relationship TMJ inner ear , propose treatment apply temporomandibular joint improve TMJ pain tinnitus . 3 . - HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES Hypothesis : The addition specific manual therapy technique ( TM ) within multimodal physiotherapy treatment effective improve TMJ pain disability cause tinnitus isolated application multimodal treatment . Objectives : General : Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD myofascial origin joint dysfunction . Specific : 1 . Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD reduce pain intensity disability cause TMD . 2 . Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD reduce intensity tinnitus disability cause tinnitus . 3 . Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD increase range motion TMJ . 4 . Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD painful rise pressuring masseter , temporal lateral pterygoid muscle . 5 . Evaluate effectiveness add specific manual therapy multimodal physical therapy patient tinnitus TMD quality life , level anxiety / depression health . 4 . METHODOLOGY Type study : randomize control pilot study , multicenter , blind randomization , patient assessment data analysis . Treatment characteristic prevent blind application . Location : 3 private consultation room specialize physiotherapy TMD . Study subject : 56 patient temporomandibular dysfunction tinnitus . Sample size : Due absence finding literature one variable primary response ( ( pain tinnitus intensity cause TMD measure visual analog scale ( VAS ) ) , pilot study make prior estimation final sample size January July 2016 . This pilot study perform order determine standard deviation study . The standard deviation 2.77 . Accepting alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.2 two-sided test , 56 subject ( 28 control group 28 experimental group ) necessary recognize statistically significant difference great equal 0.05 unit . The standard deviation assume 2.77 . It anticipate drop-out rate 10 % . Data collection analysis The patient receive six treatment session , two session first week weekly session complete intervention . The total duration intervention shall one month . Before start study , patient ask sign inform consent . 1 . At first session take place initial assessment , include collection patient data record booklet questionnaires clinical measurement . The patient receive anatomical notion temporomandibular joint relationship ear mean bodily self-consciousness ( jaw , muscle palpation ... ) give booklet health care healthy habit TMJ . 2 . At second session , treatment clinical variable measure ( ROM algometry ) , visual analog scale ( VAS ) Tinnitus Handicap Inventory Questionnaire ( THI ) treatment apply patient accord assigned intervention group . 3 . At third , fourth fifth session treatment clinical variable ( ROM algometry ) , VAS scale THI measure , treatment apply home self-care exercise hand . 4 . During sixth session treatment clinical variable measure ( ROM algometry ) , VAS scale THI , apply treatment correspond patient 's group . The follow week end treatment , patient re-evaluated . The statistical analysis perform use SPSS 22.0 program ( IBM statistical software ) . The average standard deviation quantitative variable calculate descriptive analysis sample . In non-normal distribution nonparametric sum range Wilcoxon Chi Square test performed , well homogeneity baseline display overlap confidence interval . For comparative analysis , develop accord intention treat : 1 . A MANOVA ( ANOVA repeat measure ) test carry evaluate interaction level inter - subject factor ( treatment ) intra- subject ( main variable response time ) interpret case significant . 2 . To confirm whether interaction effect significant , pairwise comparison make inter-subjects factor level ( treatment ) level main response variable time use Bonferroni method . Limitations study measure take reduce . Masking : The nature apply treatment prevents mask therapist patient . This limitation inherent type treatment evaluate common form treatment similar characteristic , therapist inevitably know type treatment apply . However , limitation prevent control clinical trial carry technology higher methodological quality . Thus , study , randomization patient blind , allocation random sequence , assessment patient evolution analysis result .</detailed_description>
