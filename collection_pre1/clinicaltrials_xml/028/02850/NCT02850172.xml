	<brief_title>Effects `` Walk , Eat , &amp; Breathe '' Nursing Intervention For Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer devastate disease poor prognosis . This largely due rather insidious progression , patient diagnose advanced cancer stage . Patients advanced stage therefore treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) shrink tumor follow curative surgery ( i.e. , esophagectomy ) . Patients ' nutritional status , functional walking capacity , emotional well-being substantially deteriorate , often increase incidence postoperative pulmonary complication , thus risk surgical death greatly increase . To good support patient esophageal cancer , critical treatment course ( approximate 4 month length ) , develop `` Walk , Eat , &amp; Breathe '' nursing intervention consist nutritional advice , walk exercise , inspiratory muscle training . The purpose stratify randomize control trial ( RCT ) test effect Walk , Eat , &amp; Breathe preserving patient ' nutritional status , functional walking capacity , pulmonary function , emotional well-being CCRT surgery course . Additionally , effect reduce treatment-related complication length hospital stay esophagectomy evaluate experimental control group . For three-year stratified RCT , total 144 consecutive patient enrol ensure power study . Patients eligible study histologically document , locally advanced tumor esophagus , defined American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stage IIB high , schedule neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy subsequent curative surgery , contraindication preclude walking . After obtain consent , participant first stratify two important covariates [ intake status ( oral intake tube feed ) tumor location ( upper third middle &amp; low third esophagus ) ] randomize separately experimental control group , accord computer-generated randomization table . Participants experimental group receive `` Walk , Eat , &amp; Breathe '' initiation CCRT end curative surgery . Participants control group receive usual care . Participants undergo measurement four point time : CCRT , CCRT , surgery , 1-month surgery . Primary endpoint include nutritional status ( body weight , lean muscle mass ) , functional walking capacity ( hand-grip strength , 6-min walk distance ) , pulmonary function ( forced vital capacity , force expiratory volume 1 second , maximal inspiratory pressure ) , emotional well-being ( anxiety/depression , quality life ) . Secondary endpoint include treatment-related complication length hospital stay esophagectomy . The treatment-related complication include chemoradiotherapy-related toxicity ( i.e. , neutropenia , esophagitis ) , rate interruption ( i.e. , discontinuation , reduction ) chemotherapy radiotherapy , unplanned hospital admission , incidence postoperative pulmonary complication , length mechanical ventilation surgery .</detailed_description>
