	<brief_summary>The regulation cardiovascular respiratory system change environmental condition change work rate essential cognitive well physical functioning . For decade , know high level headward acceleration ( +Gz ) impair cardiovascular function may cause loss consciousness . Some `` anti-g '' maneuver , muscle contraction low extremity buttock intermittent exhalation exertion ( i.e. , exhalation close airway ) prove increase tolerance high +Gz . Main objective experiment investigate effect anti-g maneuver cardiovascular respiratory tolerance push-pull-effect . Cardiovascular respiratory function evaluate follow parameter : heart rate , stroke volume , cardiac output , blood pressure , oxygen uptake , carbon dioxide output , ventilation , breathe frequency , body core temperature . Electromyography ( EMG ) judgment criterion use check quality 'muscle contraction ' anti-g maneuver . The main hypothesis anti-g maneuver increase cardiovascular respiratory tolerance push-pull effect , especially combine .</brief_summary>
