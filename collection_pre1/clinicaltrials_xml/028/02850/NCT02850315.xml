	<brief_summary>The pharmacoinvasive approach thrombolysis standard treatment myocardial infarction deadline long primary angioplasty . Coronary angioplasty carry within 3 24 hour follow thrombolysis . The adjuvant antiplatelet therapy thrombolysis combine aspirin clopidogrel ( 75 300 mg depend age ) . These clopidogrel dos associate low anti-platelet aggregation response within 24 hour follow administration . However , antiplatelet agregation inhibits progression intracoronary thrombus must optimal time angioplasty reduce risk thrombotic event . Intracoronary thrombus residual angiographic post-thrombolysis associate impaired myocardial reperfusion coronary angiography low sensitivity detect thrombus . The optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) currently method choice visualize quantify intracoronary thrombus . It use routinely presence thrombus correctly estimate size artery evaluation good stent apposition . The thrombectomy time angioplasty improve myocardial reperfusion , particularly case major thrombotic mass . Intracoronary thrombus residual post-thrombolysis could marker quality reperfusion correlate quality antiplatelet post-thrombolysis . The investigator therefore hypothesize systematic use OCT elective angioplasty ( within 3 24 hour ) successful thrombolysis could use guide use thrombectomy adequate stenting thus improve myocardial reperfusion . Our study also correlate importance residual thrombus angioplasty myocardial reperfusion one hand inhibition platelet activity observe .</brief_summary>
