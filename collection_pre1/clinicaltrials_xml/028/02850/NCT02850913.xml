	<detailed_description>Primary hypothesis Oral doxycycline 100mg daily six week patient NS age 8 year old reduce inflammatory response proportion patient serum antibody NSPs leiomodin 24 month intervention 40 % compare placebo . Primary efficacy objective To determine effect doxycycline 100mg daily six week patient NS 8 year old serum level antibody NSPs ( VGKC complex others identify concurrent case-control study ) leiomodin 24 month . Study Type This two-arm , placebo-controlled ( double blind ) randomize phase II trial oral doxycycline 100mg daily six week . Study site Kitgum general hospital , Kitgum , Uganda . Study Population Study participants patient confirm NS define accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) consensus case definition i.e . ( ) Head nod two occasion , ( ii ) Occurring cluster frequency 5-20/minute , ( iii ) Onset age 3-18 year , ( iv ) Observed trained health worker document EEG Plus one : ) trigger food cold weather ; b ) presence seizures neurological abnormality cognitive decline c ) cluster space time ) , age ≥8 year , write consent parent guardian . Study Interventions Participants receive standard care supportive treatment accord current guideline NS ( antiepileptic drug treatment sodium valproate , management psychiatric disorder , nutritional , physical occupational therapy indicate ) . All hospitalise first week period , baseline measurement include clinical assessment , EEG , cognitive laboratory test perform antiepileptic drug dos rationalise . Sample size : The sample size ( 115 participant per arm i.e . 230 total ) estimate base assumption six-weeks treatment course doxycycline reduce proportion participant antibodies NSPs Leiomodin 40 % ( 50.0 % 30.0 % ) 24 month initiation intervention provide 10 % loss follow-up ( β=80 % , α=0.05 ) . Participants randomise either oral doxycycline ( Azudox® , Kampala Pharmaceutical Industries , Ltd ) 100mg daily six week identical placebo . Treatment initiate hospital continue home . Each participant visit home 2 , 4 6 week adherence monitoring assessment safety report back hospital study clinic 6 , 12 24 month . Follow-up procedure : Participants follow 2 , 4 , 6 week health visitor document adherence ass safety assess outcome hospital 24 month initiation intervention . Data Analysis : Primary analysis intention treat . The investigator examine effect doxycycline 24 month antibody host NSPs leiomodin , inflammatory response ( CRP , C3a C3b ) , epileptiform discharge seizure control , microfilaria density/ Wolbachia load , clinical ( cognitive , motor , psychiatric quality life ) symptom compare placebo . In sub-analysis , investigator examine effect intervention new patient compare patient long stand symptom .</detailed_description>
