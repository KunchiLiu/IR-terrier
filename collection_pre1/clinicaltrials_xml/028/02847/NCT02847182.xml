	<brief_summary>This single site , prospective , randomize , double-blind study single intravenous autologous allogeneic , unrelated cord blood ( CB ) infusion child age 2-7 year Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Participants randomly assign Sequence A , consist single infusion CB cell baseline follow 6 month later single infusion placebo , Sequence B , consist infusion placebo baseline follow 6 month later infusion CB cell . All participant ultimately treat CB cell point study . Participants available qualify autologous CB unit receive autologous cell , without suitable autologous CB unit available receive cell ≥4/6 HLA-matched , ABO-matched allogeneic , unrelated donor CB unit Carolinas Cord Blood Bank . All infusion double-blinded . The primary outcome assess 6 month initial infusion sequence . Additional test secondary exploratory analysis perform 12 month . Duration study participation 12 month time baseline infusion .</brief_summary>
