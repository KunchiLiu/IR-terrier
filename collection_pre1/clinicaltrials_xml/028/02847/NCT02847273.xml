	<brief_summary>Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) continuous non-invasive technology measure regional tissue oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) . Whatever anatomical site measurement , normal value rSO2 would suggest good adequacy oxygen supply consumption regional level . Beside trend ability previous 2 3-wavelength device , new 4-wavelength generation NIRS monitor could reliably assess real-time absolute value rSO2 available . The investigator aim compare peripheral absolute rSO2 value give 4-wavelength EQUANOX device 7600 ( Nonin Medical , Plymouth , Mn ) new O3 device ( Masimo , Irvine , CA ) conventional cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
