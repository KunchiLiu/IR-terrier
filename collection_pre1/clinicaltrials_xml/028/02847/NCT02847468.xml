	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third cause death cancer . For patient inoperable advanced HCC , systematic therapy Sorafenib , multikinase inhibitor antiangiogenic antiproliferative effect , therapeutic proven survival benefit . However , efficacy Sorafenib remain inconstant medium overall survival 10,7 month disease control rate 35 43 % ; moreover , overall incidence treatment-related adverse event 80 % . Thus , appear essential find early accurate way determine patient best respond therapy order avoid toxicity cost ineffective therapy . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) show limited performance set HCC lack sensitivity , particular well-differentiated tumour . However FDG uptake relate proliferation rate efficient marker survival follow liver transplantation selective internal radiation therapy . Moreover , addition dynamic first-pass acquisition standard static scan provide good characterization tumour add information tumour perfusion . FCH reflect lipid metabolism specifically choline kinase activity , show promising result detection HCC compare FDG alone . Moreover , choline activity related kinase pathway mammalian cell , specifically inhibited Sorafenib . However FCH uptake remain inconstant HCC , relate tumour differentiation , opposition FDG . Therefore , several study suggest combined evaluation tumour glucose lipid metabolism could play complementary role evaluation HCC set detection , stag predict recurrence follow surgical resection . Thus , investigator hypothesize combination FDG FCH may accurate image evaluation HCC . Thus aim present study determine predictive performance survival lipid glucose metabolism perfusion change Sorafenib therapy patient advance HCC .</brief_summary>
