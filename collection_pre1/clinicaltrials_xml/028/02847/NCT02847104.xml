	<brief_summary>Intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient commonly display hyperglycemia , even without previously know diabetes . It demonstrate hyperglycemia associate increase hospital mortality various medical surgical ICU situation . However , discrepant result recent randomized , clinical trial tight blood glucose control ICUs allow conclusion regard whether causal link hyperglycemia ICU mortality . In addition mean blood glucose level , glucose variability recently emphasize independent predictor ICU hospital mortality . This concept describe wide variety medical , surgical trauma ICU patient . In setting , glycemic variability measure various index steadily associate ICU and/or hospital mortality non-diabetic ICU patient . Conversely , glycemic variability either weakly associate mortality ICU patient previously know diabetes . Notably , data observational , interventional trial remain lacking assess impact glycemic variability reduction ICU mortality thus demonstrate causality . However , glycemic variability consider sufficiently important mention recent international guideline management hyperglycemia critically ill patient . In publication , expert American College Critical Care Medicine emphasize glycemia maintain less 9.9 mmol/L ICU patient avoid hypoglycemia minimize glycemic variability . To achieve goal , computer-based insulin infusion protocol demonstrate superiority paper-based protocol . Glucose concentration , variation per unit time last current glucose measurement , insulin dosage , carbohydrate intake main input variable use different computerized algorithm . However , protocol widely available commercial system license fee academic protocol always go beyond pilot phase . To address issue , investigator adapt previously validate , paper-based , dynamic protocol ( DP ) actual recommend glycemic target range . Our aim ass efficacy , safety , feasibility acceptance nurse dynamic insulin protocol , compare paper-based , slide scale static protocol ( SP ) .</brief_summary>
