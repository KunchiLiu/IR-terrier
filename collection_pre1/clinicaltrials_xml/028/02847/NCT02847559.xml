	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine effect bevacizumab ( study drug ) combine Optune ( study device ) tumor treatment field therapy meningioma . Bevacizumab consider investigational US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve use treatment meningioma . The study drug medication block growth new blood vessel . It think study drug may interfere growth new blood vessel therefore might stop tumor growth , possibly shrink tumor keep receive nutrient oxygen supply blood vessel . Optune also consider investigational US FDA approve use treatment meningioma . Optune device patient wear use least 18 hour day . It deliver alternate electrical current patient 's brain tumor interrupt process call mitosis . Mitosis need occur order cell division occur allow tumor grow . By slow process , hypothesize meningioma growth may also slow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optune Delivered Electric Field Therapy Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Grade 2 3 Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) 6 month ( PFS-6 ) patient recurrent progressive meningioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival ( OS ) . II . To determine tumor response rate ( TRR ) . III . To assess quality life treatment ( QOL ) use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-Br ) questionnaire . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 course 1-4 . Beginning day 1 course 5 , patient may choose receive bevacizumab IV every 3 week remain every 2-week schedule . Patients also undergo electric field therapy use Optune ( formerly NovoTTF-100A System ) daily 18 hour . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
