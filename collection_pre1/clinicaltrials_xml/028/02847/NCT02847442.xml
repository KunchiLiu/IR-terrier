	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , uncontrolled , single-group , multi-centre trial Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient wearing-off motor fluctuation . At screening/baseline ( Visit 1 , Day 1 ) subject start treatment 50 mg opicapone ( OPC ) daily 3-month period addition current treatment levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor ( L-dopa/DDCI ) . Subjects treat L-dopa/DDCI/entacapone trial entry discontinue entacapone treatment visit . Subjects treat L-dopa/DDCI/tolcapone trial entry eligible , well previously treat OPC . Subjects treat dopamine agonist eligible . OPC enhance effect L-dopa . Hence , may necessary reduce subject 's L-dopa/DDCI dose within first day week OPC treatment extend dose interval and/or reduce amount L-dopa/DDCI per dose . Therefore , Day 15 ±3 ( Visit 2 ) investigator call subject ask adverse event ( AE , e.g . dopaminergic AEs ) require , reduce L-dopa/DDCI dose . The investigator may increase decrease total daily L-dopa/DDCI dose accord subject 's condition throughout trial , except Visit 1 . At Visit 1 L-dopa dose change . Further visit perform Day 30 ±4 ( Visit 3 ) Day 90 ±4 ( Visit 4 ) . Subjects discontinue trial participation prematurely ask come site early discontinuation visit ( EDV ) . In addition schedule visit , subject may ask call return trial site , subject may call investigator assessment safety data adjustment L-dopa/DDCI dose ( unscheduled visit ) . At Visit 4 ( EDV , applicable ) investigator arrange subject 's subsequent PD treatment , i.e . either prescribe OPC switch another treatment .</detailed_description>
