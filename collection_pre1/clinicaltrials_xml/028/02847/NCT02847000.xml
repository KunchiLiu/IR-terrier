	<brief_summary>Patients pancreatic cancer stop respond one chemotherapy drug ask take part study . The study hop find whether decitabine , drug study , effect pancreatic cancer . The decitabine give low dose approve use . It also give another drug , tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) , improve exposure pancreatic cancer cell decitabine . The purpose study determine drug combination decitabine tetrahydrouridine recognize certain DNA target cancer . All cell DNA within , tumor cell abnormal DNA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective The primary goal pilot study detect decitabine therapy induce DNMT1 protein level decrease effect size 1 use pair t-test alpha=0.05 . The effect size define difference mean DNMT1-protein level post-treatment pre-treatment divide standard deviation thus metric change natural unit distribution , standard deviation . Our goal thus detect drop DNMT1 least one standard deviation . Secondary Objectives Secondary goal include correlate DNMT1 decrease clinical response ( measure Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST1.1 ] ) , use logistic regression ; time relapse , use Cox model ; tolerability safety assessment toxicity characterization use CTCAEv4 . Study Design Single-arm , open-label , proof-of-concept clinical trial patient metastatic pancreatic cancer progress one line systemic therapy .</detailed_description>
