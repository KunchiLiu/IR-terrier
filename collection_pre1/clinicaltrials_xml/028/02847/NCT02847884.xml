	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) lifelong condition inflammation bowel . CD affect part gastrointestinal tract mouth anus . Symptoms include : tiredness , stomach pain , diarrhea ( may bloody disease severe ) , fever , weight loss , skin rash , arthritis inflammation eye . Infliximab-IFX ( Remicade® ) medication use treat CD adult child . In adult show amount drug person blood show well work . Health Canada approve Infliximab -IFX treatment CD child 9 old . In Canada , doctor may prescribe Inflixmab young child therapy resolve disease symptom . This call `` off-label '' use Infliximab . IFX level body consequently efficacy influence many biological characteristic within patient 's body . In 17 % treated IFX , patient 's immune response IFX may lead three fivefold increase risk loss response . This immune response medication often occur drug level undetectable body . Thus order achieve best result treatment , physician need able adjust dose specific patient . A recent study show 29 % child undetectable IFX level 4th medication infusion . Up 40 % patient receive schedule IFX undetectable drug level prior next infusion . In order minimize loss response , hope conduct observational cohort study pediatric patient treat IFX . This open label , cohort study aim : 1 . Determine pharmacokinetics IFX child CD factor affect IFX level first three load infusion 2 . Obtain data create model guide adjust IFX dose frequency achieve optimal trough level 5 10 ug /ml 14 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterize inflammation affect part gastrointestinal tract mouth anus . Other complication may occur outside gastrointestinal tract include : anemia , skin rash , arthritis , inflammation eye , tiredness . Symptoms often include : abdominal pain , diarrhea ( may bloody inflammation severe ) , fever weight loss . Crohn 's disease cause combination environmental , immune bacterial factor genetically susceptible individual . It result chronic inflammatory disorder , body 's immune system attack gastrointestinal tract possibly direct microbial antigen . The estimated prevalence CD Canada 234 per 100,000 person , incidence rate 13.4 per 100,000 . There medication surgical procedure cure Crohn 's disease . Treatment option help symptom , maintain remission , prevent relapse . The burden disease high disease flare complication lead hospitalization , surgery , school work absenteeism , impaired quality life . Infliximab ( IFX ) murine chimeric lgGl anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody show landmark clinical trial well-tolerated effective induction , maintenance , remission pediatric adult CD ulcerative colitis . In Canada , safety efficacy IFX establish child age 9 , yet often prescribed young child label therapy resolve disease symptom . IFX influence multiple factor body mass index ( BMI ) , serum albumin level , burden inflammation concomitant use immunosuppressive medication . Loss response IFX either result Antibodies IFX ( ATI ) insufficient serum IFX level . ATI show develop 17 % treated IFX . The risk development ATI even higher receive IFX mono-therapy , compare receive concomitant immunomodulator . It clear persistent ATI three fivefold increase risk loss response IFX compare without ATI . ATI appear interfere bioactivity IFX patient develop ATI likely subsequently manifest infusion reaction , include anaphylaxis . The standard infusion regimen IFX three load dose 5mg/kg ( dose often round near 100mg ) 0 , 2 , 6 week every 8 week thereafter . The trough level IFX 3rd load dose ( week 14 - i.e . 4th infusion ) often find great risk low ; especially child . A recent study show 29 % child undetectable IFX level 4th medication infusion . A trough level 5 ug /ml time point associate high remission rate . Conversely , low trough level ( &lt; 2.2 ug/ml ) week 14 predicts IFX discontinuation . Up 40 % patient receive schedule IFX undetectable drug level prior next infusion . However , whether undetectable IFX level trough increase risk ATI formation currently unclear . Moreover , unknown dose adjustment base trough level change rate antibody formation IFX sustain efficacy IFX achieve desire serum level clinically relevant time-points , mainly pharmacokinetics IFX child well study . Most trial assess IFX trough level ATI perform retrospectively . A recent meta-analysis impact ATI IFX level IBD show presence ATI associate significantly high risk loss clinical response IFX low serum IFX level patient IBD . One prospective trial 270 adult IBD patient remission IFX maintenance therapy regimen modify achieve trough IFX level 3-7 ug/ml , randomize dose optimization adjustment base IFX trough level - level-based ( LB ) - clinical symptom ( CB } . The primary endpoint remission 1 year similar 70 % . ATI 0 LB 2.7 % CB . However , 17 % CB require rescue therapy either corticosteroid , increase dos IFX switch another Anti-TNFa ( Vande Casteele UEGW 2013 Abstract ) . There currently prospective study pediatric patient assess treat-to-level IFX strategy Crohn 's disease . Several author suggest median trough level &gt; 3 ug/ml ( range 2.3 4.9 ) associate maintenance remission . However value tend reflect limit detection assay use rather actual biologic threshold . Lamblin report high IFX level 6.33ug /ml associate high remission rate compare level 3.39 ug /ml . Based author ' modeling , level 5.6 ug /ml would lead low inflammatory burden base C reactive protein ( CRP } &lt; 5 ug /ml . In recent large retrospective study IFX Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) patient ( n=l36 } , Arias report level 7.9 ug /ml give 57 % sensitivity 80 % specificity predict best sustain response IFX . Based data hypothesize ideal trough level likely 5 10 ug /ml . The upper range trough level range close upper interquartile range Arias ' study . A barrier knowledge advancement emanate recent change laboratory technique use assess serum IFX level ATI . A private laboratory United States , Prometheus , previously accessible laboratory clinician could obtain serum IFX ATI level use enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Recently , stop perform ELISA test move extremely expensive homogeneous mobility shift assay ( HMSA ) measurement IFX ATI . The advantage new test ability detect presence ATI IFX serum time . With previous ELISA test , ATI measurable presence IFX , thus ATI status typically label `` inconclusive '' set . Despite advantage , currently evidence justify use sensitive expensive HMSA test clinical set particular support evidence warrant use test part treat level strategy . At time therapeutic drug monitoring IFX precision dose biologic agent become increasingly hot topic , Alberta Health Services refuse pay HMSA test patient treat IFX exorbitant cost . In attempt overcome barrier precision care , biochemistry laboratory University Hospital ( UAH ) , leadership Dr Connie Prosser , develop locally develop ( ELISA ) IFX level ATI fraction cost charge Prometheus ( $ 50 IFX level $ 50 ATI- total $ 100 test compare US $ 2500 IFX ATI per test ) . The UAH test validate local study able measure IFX level 0.4 ug/ml , good inter- intra- assay precision . Based patient sample , correlation UAH test HMSA result excellent ( R2= 0.92 value range &lt; 0.4 ug/ml &gt; 45 ug/ml R2 = 0.98 value &lt; 20 ug/ml ) . ATI ( unbound ) measure level ≥ 2 ug/ml sample IFX concentration &lt; 10 ug/ml . A second ELISA available measure total ATI ( i.e . free bound circulate IFX ) , detect antibody sample high IFX concentration need . This test available clinical use Edmonton Zone . However current indication test patient exhibit clinical loss response IFX . Dose Optimization common , 70 % u dose optimize clinically . Early dose optimization third infusion likely well . How dose optimize unclear .</detailed_description>
