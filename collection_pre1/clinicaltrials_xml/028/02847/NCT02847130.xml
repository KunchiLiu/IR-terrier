	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure rate adherence select Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) -endorsed supportive care clinical practice guideline ( CPG ) recommendation National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Community Oncology Research Program ( NCORP ) sit . ( Aim 1 ) II . To describe possible influence NCORP site size number patient enrol COG study per site delivery CPG-consistent care . ( Aim 1a ) III . To describe clinical outcome episodes patient receive CPG-consistent CPG-inconsistent care . ( Aim 1b ) IV . To describe facilitator barrier use CPGs elicit via focus group interview diverse set potential user ( physician , nurse , nurse practitioner pharmacist ) provide pediatric cancer care NCORP sit . ( Aim 2 ) V. To improve well CPG recommendation understand health care provider refine CPG recommendation format base iterative process cognitive interview formatting revision . ( Aim 3 ) OUTLINE : AIM 1 ( MEASURING CPG CONSISTENT CARE ) : Patients separate CPG evaluate ( fever neutropenia [ FN ] , chemotherapy induce nausea vomit [ CINV ] , fertility preservation [ FP ] ) randomly select medical chart review . Patients eligible episode FN , CINV FP within health record select data record abstract review COG adherence COG endorse CPGs . AIM 2 ( FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO CPG ADHERENCE ) : Health care provider provide direct care pediatric oncology patient identify separated participate three type focus group : physician-only , non-physician , mixed .
