	<brief_summary>The research project aim try answer many question raise identification new early repolarization syndrome . The question vary take optimal clinical management patient , frequency significance anomaly population electrophysiological molecular basis responsible electrocardiographic abnormality . To try answer many question , approach twofold : clinical genetic . - Establishment clinical database contain information patient identify carrier anomaly base initial clinical presentation order determine prognosis . - Physiological approach base molecular approach identify genetic abnormality may involve syndrome . - 200 asymptomatic patient unlimited number patient present syncope abort sudden death include . A blood sample ( 15 ml ) perform inclusion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presence early repolarization aspect , determine J point elevation least 0.1 mV isoelectric line , without extraST segment elevation least two lead / lateral . Parameters ECG D2 level bypass measurable presence long QT syndrome . Late potential ventricular analyzable . For patient ventricular fibrillation , negative search cause ventricular fibrillation . For patient syncope , clinical assessment include minimum , perform cardiac ultrasound stress test . Impossibility receive clear information ( patient 's intellectual default ) . Refusal sign inform consent participation . Under protective measure justice .</criteria>
