	<brief_summary>Our study aim characterise possible pluripotent cell population abdomen responsible peritoneal adhesion . We therefore want take sample woman undergo plan laparoscopic surgery without adhesion , isolate cell characterise marker pluripotency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differences Peritoneal Stem Cells Women With Without Adhesions After Gynaecological Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal adhesion connective tissue band two normally separate anatomical structure within abdominal pelvic cavity . Those adhesion occur gynaecological surgery involve pelvis abdomen . Adhesions severe clinical well economical Consequences . There substantial morbidity ( chronical pain obstruction infertility ) high surgical risk additional surgery need , due higher intraoperative blood loss high incidence laceration peritoneal adhesion present . In combination prolong surgery duration , economical impact tremendous . A 2011 study estimate cost adhesion - related surgery 2,3 billion US dollar exclusively USA . 46.3 % surgery origin localisation gynaecological area . The genesis adhesiolysis - obligatory peritoneal adhesion remain unclear date . After surgery cytokine induce fibrotic band appear within 72 hour . Usually band eliminated fibrinolytic sequence within 10 day . For Adhesions persist afterwards generally accept assumption , failure fibrinolytic sequence unknown origin . Adhesions persist 10-14 day become thicker vascularised . In `` adult '' adhesion fibrin find also fat tissue , smooth muscle myelinised un - myelinised axon . In developmental biology tissue differentiate different germ layer , namely mesoderm ectoderm . Finding cell multiple germ layer point towards pluri - , multi- , stem cell like precursor cell adhesion develop . Such cellpopulation characterise abdomen date writing , though Studies show evidence ( range mesothelial - - mesenchymal shift Clusters differentiation multiple germ layer ) make multiple researcher postulate pluripotent precursor cell locate submesothelium . In research therefore take peritoneal sample adhesion , peritoneal wall lining omentum subject without peritoneal adhesion subject undergo indicated laparoscopic surgery gynaecological ward Pius hospital Oldenburg . The sample routinely take part procedure usually discard . At least 24 hour prior surgery , subject chance give inform consent donate sample study . The study thus design way subject wo n't undergo additional risk participate study . Taking part refusal hereof wo n't effect treatment surgical outcome subject . Also , take part study wo n't benefit additional risk subject . The sample take university Leipzig , culture , isolate characterise cell . Characterisation mostly application pluripotency marker , cell sort immunoassay . Expression profile use understand mesothelial - - mesenchymal shift . Depending finding protocol analysis adjust consultation Prof. dr. dr. De Wilde Prof. dr. Bader . The study approximately take 6 month , additional 6 month write publication . The study fund research funding pool university Oldenburg .</detailed_description>
