	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( Hypertension ) extremely common major cause heart disease , kidney disease stroke . One three UK ( United Kingdom ) population require treatment hypertension point life . A healthy lifestyle alone often enough control blood pressure , drug treatment usually require . Although wide variety drug available treat hypertension , choose right kind tablet combination tablet individual patient problem , therefore many people poor blood pressure control . Hypertension treatment within UK currently select accord age self-defined ethnicity ( SDE ) . There limitation approach include wide variability response hypertension drug class people . There also uncertainty select hypertension drug ethnic minority African/Caribbean ancestry , example , South Asians lack information trial . In AIM HY-INFORM study investigator look recruit equal number black/caribbean , south asian white european participant able compare difference hypertension treatment ethnicity . The primary objective study determine response antihypertensive drug differs self define ethnicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In UK , current NICE ( National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ) guidance stratifies hypertension treatment accord age self-defined ethnicity ( SDE ) . Different initial monotherapies recommend age 55 year , young black compare white individual . However , recommend stratification combination therapy . The evidence base support current guidance SDE stratification limit , specific lack data UK base population . Stratification base SDE number limitation alternative approach stratification base ancestry informative marker ( AIM ) . There genetic polymorphism , show substantially different frequency population different geographical region , predict geographical ancestry remarkable accuracy . AIM thus likely capture genetic component variation drug response ethnically diverse population . Metabolomic profile plasma urine may provide complementary information AIM , differences individual reflect genetic environmental influence . To address issue investigator intend compare variation response antihypertensive drug treatment three SDE cohort , relate variation AIM metabolomic profile . Our objective test validity current NICE guidance antihypertensive stratification base SDE , provide evidence SDE stratification dual therapy , examine whether effective personalisation antihypertensive treatment , achieve use AIM and/or metabolomic profiling . An assessment patient stratification base AIM phenotype SDE enable selection optimal effective choice anti-hypertensive treatment currently exist first line drug ( combination ) ultimately reduce attrition antihypertensive therapy . Output trial provide first perspective evidence best treatment choice accord SDE white , black asian population UK . This reduce number consultation ; time require achieve optimal blood pressure control contribution hypertension control UK . Patients trial enrol monotherapy dual therapy regime depend history hypertension . The monotherapy group patient enter randomise , open-label , three-treatment three-period cross trial . The dual therapy group patient enter randomise , open-label , four-treatment four-period cross trial . Randomisation , crossover design , stratify three SDE group . The duration individual participant approximately 24 ( monotherapy ) 32 week ( dual therapy ) The hypertensive medication use trial : Amlodipine 5 10mg , Chlortalidone 25mg , Amiloride 10mg , Lisinopril 10 20mg , Participants dual therapy treatment arm total 11 visit include screening/enrolment ( visit 1 ) baseline visit ( visit 2 ) Participants monotherapy treatment arm total 9 visit include screening/enrolment ( visit 1 ) baseline visit ( visit 2 ) A total number 1320 participant enrol study across participate site , approximately 660 participant therapy regime ( approximately 220 participant per ethnic group ) complete trial .</detailed_description>

SelfDefine Ethnicity : participant SELF IDENTIFY 1 three group : White White British White Irish Any white background Black Black British Black Caribbean Black African Any black background Asian Asian British Asian Indian Asian Pakistani Asian Bangladeshi Any Asian background 4 . Be hypertensive define : Monotherapy rotation 1. currently untreated EITHER ABPM day time average blood pressure ≥ 135mmHG ( systolic ) ≥ 85mmHg ( diastolic ) OR Home BP measurement use validated device base average 10 blood pressure reading ≥135 mmHg ( systolic ) ≥85 mmHg ( diastolic ) 2 . Patients may take antihypertensive drug sub therapeutic dos ineffective combination , felt likely controllable study drug willing able wash , discretion CI ( Chief Investigator ) / PI ( Principal Investigator ) , enter trial meet criterion . Dual therapy rotation a.Treated hypertensive receive one three antihypertensive drug blood pressure ( ABPM daytime average blood pressure Home BP . ) 135 200 mmHg ( systolic ) AND 85 110 mmHg ( diastolic ) . The presence follow mean participant ineligible : Participant fit one define ethnic group e.g . Mixed Pregnant breastfeed woman Known suspect secondary hypertension Significant sensitivity contraindication study medication Participants take lithium regularly consume nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug variable dos Requirement take study drug continuously e.g . ACEi heart failure Any clinically significant hepatic impairment Any clinically significant kidney impairment Concurrent participation another clinical trial use systemic vasoactive medication medication know interact study drug ( participation another study part AIM HY mechanistic social science programme exclusion criterion ) Patients deem unsuitable investigator clinical ground</criteria>
