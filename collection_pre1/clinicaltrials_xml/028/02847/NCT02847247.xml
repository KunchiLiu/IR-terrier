	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study classify volunteer endotoxin-responders non-responders follow inhalation 20,000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin ( CCRE ) . Endotoxin commonly encounter bioaerosol component indoor outdoor air pollution . For reason remain unclear , individual appear susceptible inflammatory effect inhale endotoxin others , possibly owe single nucleotide polymorphism Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) gene influence TLR4 signal function . These susceptible individual represent population particular interest mechanistic study effect endotoxin therapeutic trial . Susceptibility inhale endotoxin determine measure change peripheral blood neutrophil count , biomarker systemic inflammation , follow inhaled CCRE . In previous work , investigator find inhalation 20,000 EU CCRE well tolerate induces measurable increase neutrophil content peripheral blood susceptible individual . Our hope CCRE inhalation protocol employ screen large population susceptibility inflammatory effect inhale endotoxin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Inflammatory Response CCRE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , screen study involve recruitment 18 normal volunteer ( NV ) . The protocol power compare absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) blood 6 hour inhalational challenge CCRE compare baseline . In addition , secondary endpoint , investigator evaluate inflammatory cytokine level systemic circulation access presence gene think related endotoxin response . Visits conduct study coordinator study staff , physical exam perform PI study physician . Eighteen subject recruit . There gender ethnic restriction , subject healthy volunteer . Prior enrollment study , subject participate protocol 98-0799 ( screen database study CEMALB ) . Data medical history allergy skin test collect screen protocol include data study . Subjects positive allergy skin test exclude . Spirometry perform determine current level lung function . In order identify individual appear susceptible systemic inflammatory effect endotoxin exposure , subject undergo inhaled endotoxin challenge baseline visit follow 6 hour later blood draw complete blood count differential allow calculation absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) . Subjects consider `` responder '' peripheral ANC increase least 20 % follow inhaled endotoxin challenge .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects must 1850 year age eligible study participation 2 . Subjects must willing able provide inform consent participate study procedures 3 . Normal lung function , define ( Knudson 1976/1984 predict set ) : 1 . Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) &gt; 80 % predicted gender , ethnicity , age height 2 . ( Forced Expiratory Volume first second ) FEV1 &gt; 80 % predicted gender , ethnicity , age height 3 . FEV1/FVC ratio &gt; 0.75 predict gender , ethnicity , age height 4 . Oxygen saturation &gt; 94 % Normal blood pressure ( Systolic 150 90 , Diastolic 9060 mm Hg ) 5 . Symptom Score ( define section `` f '' ) great 6 ( possible 24 ) total symptom score value great 2 one score . 1 . Any chronic medical condition consider PI contraindication exposure study include significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes require medication , chronic renal disease , chronic thyroid disease . 2 . Physician direct emergency treatment asthma exacerbation within precede 3 month . 3 . Moderate Severe asthma 4 . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 5 . Nighttime symptom cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma 6 . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . 7 . History intubation asthma 8 . Daily use NSAIDs , inability withhold NSAIDs 4 day prior dose . 9 . Use medication may impact result study include , limited , systemic corticosteroid , beta blocker . 10 . Cigarette smoke &gt; 1 pack per month . 11 . BMI &gt; 35 . 12 . Pregnant breast feed woman include . 13 . Subjects employ within past 6 month occupation high risk endotoxin exposure , grain storage site swine containment . 14 . Subjects defer acute , nonchronic medical condition require treatment , bronchitis , pneumonia febrile illness minimum 4 week complete resolution symptom .</criteria>
