	<brief_summary>This open-label phase IV , randomize control trial inactivate poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) rotavirus vaccine . This trial ass immunogenicity booster dose fractional IPV ( fIPV ) comparison full dose IPV give vary IPV fIPV schedule . Differences immunogenicity vary schedule IPV fIPV also examine . Concomitantly , immunogenicity two different rotavirus vaccine evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fractional Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Booster Rotavirus Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With switch trivalent bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( OPV ) 2016 , Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) recommend inactivate poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) use one potential strategy respond outbreaks type 2 wild type and/or circulate vaccine-derived poliovirus . However , current global inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ; 0.5 mL , full-dose ) supply shortage dramatically limit number dos available effective outbreak response . Therefore , GPEI propose use intradermal administration booster fractional IPV ( fIPV ; 0.1 mL , one-fifth full-dose ) dose-sparing strategy increase number child vaccinate stretch IPV supply . No study compare immunogenicity fIPV booster child previously vaccinate single IPV . Furthermore , IPV shortage lead reconsideration fIPV use routine immunization program . Previous study find one two dose head-to-head comparison , fIPV induce low proportion seroconversion antibody responses IPV . However , recent study seroconversion prim suggest two fIPV give least eight week apart may immunogenic one IPV . Because finding global IPV shortage , recent WHO position paper suggest country consider administer two fIPV 6 14 week age alternative one IPV OPV2 cessation April 2016 . However , trial conduct direct comparison immunogenicity IPV 14 week age fIPV 6 14 week age . The immunogenicity rotavirus ( RV ) vaccine also assess give concomitantly IPV/fIPV . Currently , WHO recommend either two license , live attenuate oral rotavirus vaccine child worldwide : pentavalent RotaTeq ( RV5 ) monovalent Rotarix ( RV1 ) . Many low income country IPV introduce also poise introduce rotavirus vaccine come year . The first dose OPV interfere RV vaccine RV vaccine may immunogenic deliver IPV compare OPV . The propose study present opportunity compare two three dose response RV1 RV5 deliver IPV compare previous study Bangladesh co-administered OPV . In addition , recent study suggest host genetic factor ( i.e. , Secretor status Lewis salivary ABO blood group phenotype ) mediate susceptibility rotavirus infection . More precisely , non-secretors ( i.e. , child lack functional fucosyl transferse-2 [ FUT2 ] gene ) substantially reduce risk rotavirus infection certain genotype . Furthermore , certain rotavirus genotype infect mainly Lewis negative child , independent secretor status . In addition , blood group antigen status propose associate infection ( lack infection ) particular rotavirus genotype . The propose trial ass whether Secretor status , Lewis salivary ABO blood group phenotype also associate vaccine response .</detailed_description>
