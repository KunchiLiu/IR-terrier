	<detailed_description>Standard indication palliative radiation bony metastasis include pain , spinal cord compression , impend pathologic fracture . Palliative radiation therapy serve reduce pain , improve quality life , avoid complication . Tailored train paravertebral musculature may support radiation therapy improve name factor . DISPO-2 designed investigate impact tailor physical exercise patient unstable vertebral metastasis compare manual therapy ( progressive muscle relaxation ) . The trial include patient painful bony metastasis , patient spinal cord compression impend pathological fracture exclude . The investigation carry prospective randomize control phase-II parallel group design . Patients randomize one follow group : patient arm A carry daily physical training consist four different isometric exercise guidance supervision physiotherapist . Training start day one ( first radiotherapy session ) , 10 daily unit 30 min schedule radiotherapy . Patients expect continue train 12 week post completion radiotherapy home . Patients arm B ( control group ) receive 10 daily session 15 min progressive muscle relaxation start day one radiotherapy . Follow-up patient schedule 12 week post completion radiotherapy incl . CT spine physical examination .</detailed_description>
