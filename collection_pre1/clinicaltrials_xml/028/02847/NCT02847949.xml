	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 multi-center , open-label study allow subject derive clinical benefit complete IGN002 treatment separate Valor study ( e.g . IGN002-101 ) continue treatment IGN002 . Subjects complete separate Valor-sponsored IGN002 study , tolerate IGN002 treatment , experience progressive disease ( PD ) eligible participate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In extension study , IGN002 study drug initially administer dose level schedule subject receive conclusion Valor IGN002 study ( e.g. , IGN002-101 ) . If additional safety PK data another Valor IGN002 study support high dose level deem safe well tolerate Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) , dose IGN002 may increase within give subject . However , dose level IGN002 extension study may exceed maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . In addition , dose give subject may lower per Investigator discretion ( see Dose Modification ) . Each treatment cycle comprise total 8 dos IGN002 administer weekly interval . Subjects evaluate study clinic dose IGN002 . At study visit , standard of-care assessment perform , include physical examination , measurement vital sign , documentation adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication , laboratory analysis blood urine . Radiological assessment perform end 8-week cycle . Tumor status assess comparison subject 's baseline tumor status , determine Valor study , tumor nadir , subject demonstrate response . Reasons subject withdrawal include PD subject derive clinical benefit IGN002 therapy clinically significant IGN002-related AEs . If subject discontinues study reason , early termination ( ET ) visit conduct 30 ( Â±3 ) day last dose IGN002 . This visit include physical examination , vital sign measurement , laboratory analysis blood urine , documentation AEs concomitant medication .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Currently enrol Valorsponsored IGN002 study 2 . Derived clinical benefit IGN002 , define CR , PR , SD , another Valorsponsored IGN002101 study ( e.g. , IGN002101 ) 3 . Tolerated IGN002 therapy Valorsponsored IGN002 study 4 . Female subject postmenopausal ( menstrual period minimum 12 month ) surgically sterilize negative serum pregnancy test upon entry . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use oral implanted contraceptive , double barrier method birth control intrauterine device upon enrollment 3 month receive last dose IP . Male subject surgically sterile willing use contraception upon enrollment 3 month receive last dose IP . 5 . Able willing provide inform consent 1 . Discontinued another Valor IGN002 study due AE consider Investigator related IGN002 treatment 2 . Experienced PD participation another Valor study 3 . Pregnant nursing 4 . Concurrent medical condition precludes safe participation study 5 . Active viral hepatitis infection . Subjects history hepatitis infection active eligible .</criteria>
