	<brief_summary>AC0058TA small molecule compound potently , selectively irreversibly inhibits Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) phosphorylation downstream signal , result inhibition inflammatory cytokine production monocytes inhibition lymphocyte activation ( predominantly B-cell activation ) preclinical study . The nonclinical program demonstrate AC0058TA potential interfere signal function mediate tyrosine kinase may useful control excessive aberrant T- B-cell activation autoimmune disease . As investigational targeted therapy RA SLE , AC0058TA expect address unmet need patient population , currently effect therapy great unmet medical need , AC0058TA may inhibit key pathway involve disease process .</brief_summary>
