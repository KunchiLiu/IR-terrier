	<criteria>1 . The subject least 18 year age screening . 2 . The subject weigh minimum 40 kg body mass index le 40 kg/m^2 screening . 3 . Sexually active woman childbearing potential must use two different form highly effective contraception . Males participate study must use condom length study , least 64 day discontinue study drug . 4 . The subject diagnosis symptomatic idiopathic heritable PAH ( IPAH HPAH ) . 5 . A Baseline 6MWD 150 550 metre require , absence concurrent injury , illness ( PAH PAH related condition ) , confound factor would effect subject 's exercise capacity . 6 . The subject either treatment na誰ve receive approve PDE5 inhibitor / approve ERA least 60 day prior screen stable dose 30 day willing remain PDE5 inhibitor / ERA dose duration 16week treatment phase . 7 . The subject must optimally treated conventional pulmonary hypertension therapy ( e.g. , oral vasodilator , oxygen , digoxin , etc . ) addition , discontinuation , dose change least 14 day prior screen ( exclude diuretic anticoagulant dose adjustment ) . 8 . The subject undergone right heart catheterisation screening ( within 8 week screen ) document mean pulmonary artery pressure ( PAPm ) great equal 25 mmHg , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) less equal 15 mmHg , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) 3 Wood unit . 9 . The subject undergone echocardiography screen evidence clinically normal leave systolic diastolic ventricular function , absence clinically significant leave sided heart disease ( e.g. , mitral valve stenosis ) absence unrepaired congenital heart disease . 10 . The subject previous ventilation perfusion lung scan / high resolution computerise tomography scan chest / pulmonary angiography consistent diagnosis PAH ( e.g. , low probability pulmonary embolism ; absence major perfusion defect ) . 11 . The subject pulmonary function test do within 9 month screen follow : Total lung capacity ( TLC ) least 60 % ( predict value ) Forced expiratory volume one second/forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) ratio least 50 % 12 . In opinion Principal Investigator , subject able communicate effectively study personnel , consider reliable , willing likely cooperative protocol requirement . 13 . The subject voluntarily give write informed consent participate study . 1 . The subject pregnant lactating . 2 . The subject receive epoprostenol , treprostinil , intravenous iloprost , beraprost within 30 day prior screen ( except use acute vasoreactivity test ) . 3 . The subject previous intolerance significant lack efficacy prostacyclin prostacyclin analogue result discontinuation inability titrate therapy effectively . 4 . The subject disease associate PH idiopathic PAH heritable PAH atrial septostomy . 5 . The subject WHO functional class IV . 6 .
