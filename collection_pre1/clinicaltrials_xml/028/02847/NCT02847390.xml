	<brief_title>Implementation Evaluation Inpatient Diabetes Superuser Education Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both hyperglycemia hypoglycemia hospital associate various adverse outcome , include increased complication , length stay , cost , mortality . To address issue , Johns Hopkins Hospital ( JHH ) establish Inpatient Glucose Management Program 2006 address hypoglycemia hyperglycemia ensure safe , standardize care delivery hospitalize patient diabetes . To support nurse education compliance JHH glucose management policy , diabetes nurse `` superuser '' program initiate January 2007 critical implement hypoglycemia policy nursing intervention . Following establishment hospital-wide glucose management policy order set hypoglycemia hyperglycemia , nursing diabetes `` superuser '' education program , clinical decision support tool prescribers , significant sustain reduction incidence hypoglycemia ( ~20 % ) 3-year time period . However , incidence severe hyperglycemia significantly reduce intervention , indicate differential impact program hyperglycemia compare hypoglycemia . The investigator believe disparity due hypoglycemia policy implement nursing staff , whereas hyperglycemia policy order set implement prescribers ( e.g. , housestaff hospitalists ) . Given success invesigators nurse program 's contributing sustain reduction hypoglycemia , investigator hypothesize analogous diabetes prescriber superuser program , target physician , effective educational approach address persistent hyperglycemia . The investigator proposal ( 1 ) seek improve diabetes treatment hospital , routine relevant healthcare set ( 2 ) utilize exist healthcare infrastructure integrate hospitals—nursing staff physicians—making practical , scalable , sustainable health system . The investigator follow specific aim : ( 1 ) develop diabetes prescriber superuser educational curriculum Johns Hopkins Health System ( JHHS ) stakeholder community engagement ; ( 2 ) refine package JHH diabetes nurse prescriber superuser educational curriculum electronic tool kit disseminate locally 3 JHHS hospital , base stakeholder feedback ; ( 3 ) evaluate impact implement JHH diabetes nurse prescriber superuser program 3 JHHS hospital glycemic clinical outcome measure ( primary ) . The investigator secondarily assess program 's impact glycemic process economic measure .</detailed_description>
