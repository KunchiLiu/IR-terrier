	<detailed_description>Background Improvements cancer treatment lead increase number patient cured remission , follow detect recurrence , manage persistent symptom late treatment effect . With grow survivor , traditional hospital follow-up sustainable . New model follow-up care need . Aim To develop establish feasibility introduce new electronic care pathway/system remote monitor ovarian cancer patient remission . Methods An exist online patient symptom reporting system extend use remote follow-up . A track program develop IT system integrate local hospital . Development Phase : ) Scoping literature review exist validated symptom measure . b ) Consultation expert group establish choice question , relevant symptom , timing/frequency monitoring . c ) Interviews patient clinician explore current pathway redesign . Before-and-After Study A multi-centred quasi-experimental between-subjects before-and-after design compare usual care ( control ) new electronic care pathway/system . 168 participant recruit Leeds , Bradford , Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield , Airedale ( N=84 Leeds , N=84 sit ) . Both phase recruit ~12 month . In control group , 84 eligible patient ( post-treatment ) recruit data collect routine appointment 12 month clinical outcome 6 monthly patient-reported outcome . In intervention consenting patient ( N=84 ) remind use system every ~3 month blood test GP . Information display respective EPR . Patients always option speak to/see 'key clinician ' . Virtual clinic hold clinician review/respond data . Clinical patient outcomes collect , end-of-study interview conduct . Outcomes - Develop new electronic care pathway/system remote monitoring patient remission - Obtain initial data clinical patient feasibility .</detailed_description>
