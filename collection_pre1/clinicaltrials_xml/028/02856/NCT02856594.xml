	<brief_title>Minimizing ICU Neurological Dysfunction With Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium acute brain dysfunction characterize disturbance attention , awareness , cognition explain preexist neurocognitive disorder . It one six leading cause preventable morbidity mortality hospitalize elderly patient . Delirium associate increased mortality , prolonged hospitalization , prolonged institutionalization , long-term cognitive deficit . Patients pre-existing dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , especially vulnerable develop delirium . The total healthcare cost attributable delirium estimate $ 143 $ 152 billion annually . In United States , delirium occur approximately 80 % critically ill patient admit medical/surgical intensive care unit ( ICU ) , 43 % patient admitted cardiac surgical ( CS ) ICU . Most patient diagnose delirium also present multiple comorbidities ( sepsis , multi-organ failure ) significantly confound understanding disease . Thus , date , pharmacological intervention treat delirium identify . There mount evidence suggest sleep deprivation may modifiable risk factor development delirium . Presently , pharmacological treatment current medication ( benzodiazepine , antipsychotic ) induce natural sleep reliably reduces incidence delirium . The investigator find biomimetic sleep , define pharmacological induction rapid eye movement sleep ( REM ) non-REM ( N1 , N2 , N3 ) sleep state use dexmedetomidine , achieve human . The overall objective study evaluate efficacy biomimetic sleep reduce incidence severity delirium extubated CSICU patient . The investigator also assess peri-operative electroencephalogram biomarkers delirium , association delirium chronic neuroinflammation use positron emission tomography . The MINDDS study poise enable therapeutic diagnostic discovery aid care elderly patient risk develop postoperative delirium .</detailed_description>
