	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare acute nerve decompression versus nonoperative treatment management peroneal nerve palsy total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) .

	<brief_title>Acute Nerve Decompression Versus Non-operative Treatment Peroneal Nerve Palsy Following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peroneal nerve palsy TKA report literature 0.3 % 1.5 % , although high 9.5 % . Several risk factor describe : preoperative valgus deformity flexion contracture , prolong intraoperative use tourniquet , use epidural anesthesia , rheumatoid arthritis . Peroneal palsy rarely diagnosed postoperative day 0 , 85 % case , present prior postoperative day 4.Initial treatment include flex knee , remove compressive bandage , discontinue epidural anesthesia . When residual deficit , supportive measure initiate , include application ankle-foot orthosis physical therapy prevent ankle contracture . If clinical recovery six twelve week , electromyography ( EMG ) typically perform . Some clinician advocate use EMG study acute phase . In case incomplete recovery , delayed surgical exploration decompression peroneal nerve option report improve outcome . Unfortunately , case respond , even surgical treatment . In addition , little information available describing outcome acute surgical decompression peroneal nerve palsy total knee arthroplasty . While retrospective case report series examine outcomes delayed peroneal nerve decompression , unaware report describe acute decompression . Delayed decompression peroneal nerve associate return nerve function . Krackow et al . report result five patient underwent delayed surgical decompression peroneal nerve palsy total knee arthroplasty average 27.2 month ( range , 5-50 month ) find 100 % able discontinue use ankle-foot orthosis 80 % full neurological recovery . The patient partial return neurological function undergo decompression almost four year postoperatively . Mont et al . find , patient underwent surgical peroneal nerve decompression two sixty month follow total knee arthroplasty , 97 % report functional subjective improvement mean three year post-decompression able discontinue use ankle-foot orthosis . Only 33 % patient manage nonoperatively report improvement functional subjective outcome . Therefore , 33 % patient , acute decompression would necessary , 67 % , may beneficial . In study , patient underwent trial nonoperative treatment , patient underwent peroneal nerve decompression earlier two month index total knee arthroplasty . Initial experience two peroneal nerve palsy follow TKA encourage institution offer acute decompression patient present peroneal palsy follow total knee arthroplasty . This parallels practice pattern regard wrist , acute carpal tunnel release perform avoid complication patient demonstrates carpal tunnel compressive symptom postoperatively wrist surgery . While patient improve nonoperative treatment time , acute decompression may accelerate recovery , decrease uncertainty stress patient surgeon . The surgical technique relatively straightforward ; however , surgeon patient must consider risk second anesthetic operation . In previous experience acute delay decompression , direct damage nerve rare , fascial band , hematoma , local edema typically identify contribute compression peroneal nerve . Therefore , nonoperative treatment would possibly result return nerve function hematoma resorb edema decrease , may still residual dysfunction time period nerve compression thicken fascial band around nerve . Additional study acute decompression warrant understand offer short long-term advantage nonoperative treatment . Treatment Groups : Acute Nerve Decompression - patient initially receive conservative management ( flex knee , remove compressive bandage , discontinue epidural anesthesia ) follow peroneal nerve decompression within 1 week diagnosis peroneal nerve palsy . Decompression involve surgical intervention set sterile operating room . The patient provide multiple option anesthesia ( per discussion anesthesia team ) . The surgical procedure involve incision lateral aspect knee , near proximal fibula level fibular neck . The peroneal nerve carefully identify dissect . Tissue surround impinge nerve carefully remove cut rid compressive environment . The nerve re- examined ensure additional point compression/irritation . The soft-tissues skin subsequently close suture . Nonoperative Treatment - patient receive conservative management ( flex knee , remove compressive bandage , discontinue epidural anesthesia ) well supportive measure ( ankle-foot orthosis physical therapy ) symptoms lasting longer 6 week . Outcome Measures : Primary Measure - â‰¥ 3/5 dorsiflexion strength 3 month surgery/randomization</detailed_description>
