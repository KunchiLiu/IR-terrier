	<brief_summary>Stroke ( 795,000/year US 30 million exist stroke survivor world ) damage brain neural structure control coordinate upper limb movement . To effectively target brain damage , intervention direct restore brain control serve coordination peripheral neuromuscular function . Currently , lack transformative intervention strategy , limited efficacy see response neural rehabilitation peripherally-directed ( limbs e.g . ) direct brain . This study employ novel neural feedback approach closed-loop , real-time paradigm engage retrain exist brain function stroke . Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rtfMIR ) provide neural feedback advantage precisely identify location brain activity multiple cognitive emotional task . However , rtfMRI costly precludes motor learn require sit engage upper limb complex motor task image acquisition . In contrast , real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( rtfNIRS ) , although spatially precise rtfMRI , offer low-cost , portable solution provide brain neural feedback motor learning . This proposal utilize technology hybrid , sequential motor learn protocol . Moreover , study protocol also simultaneously involve central effective signal ( neural feedback ) peripheral affective signal employ neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) -assisted coordination practice , produce peripherally-induced affective signal muscle joint receptor . This novel combination intervention protocol engage central nervous system , motor effective pathway training along induction affective signal production ( FES-assisted practice ) , implement within framework evidence-based motor learn principle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim develop test innovative protocol recovery wrist extension stroke , use combination rtfMRI , rtfNIRS , FES , motor learning . Aim I . Test innovative coordination training protocol combination rtfMRI/rtfNIRS central neural feedback peripherally-directed , neurally-triggered FES-assisted coordination practice implement within framework motor learn principle . Hypothesis 1 . Chronic stroke survivor show significant improvement upper limb function response combine rtfMRI/rtfNIRS central neural feedback ; peripherally-directed FES-assisted coordination practice wrist finger extension ; whole arm/hand motor learning ( Primary measure : Arm Motor Abilities Test ( AMAT ) ; secondary measure include : AMAT Wrist/Hand subscale ; Fugl-Meyer upper limb coordination ; quality life ( Craig Handicap Assessment Rating Tool ) ) . Secondary Aim II . Measure change brain activation pattern response propose treatment . Objective : During attempted wrist finger extension , investigator measure baseline treatment response accord brain activation volume , intensity , centroid location , white matter integrity .</detailed_description>
