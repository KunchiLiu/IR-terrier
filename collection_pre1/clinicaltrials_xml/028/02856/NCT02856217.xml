	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse occurs uterus vaginal wall bulge beyond vaginal introitus . Abdominal sacrocolpopexy durable operation advance pelvic organ prolapse serve criterion standard operation compare . Abdominal sacrocolpopexy involves attach vaginal apex sacral anterior longitudinal ligament reinforce graft , usually synthetic mesh . More 225.000 surgery perform annually United States pelvic organ prolapse . Abdominal sacrocolpopexy consider durable pelvic organ prolapse surgery , little known safety long-term effectiveness . Purpose study compare effect tunnel non-tunneling mesh placement low urinary tract symptom bowel symptom patient underwent surgery laparoscopic robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy accept surgical procedure pelvic organ prolapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Tunneling During Minimally Invasive Sacrocolpopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse represent common female pelvic floor disorder increase age serious impact quality life . It estimate 30 % woman age 50-89 year seek consultation pelvic floor disorder . The purpose surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse restore pelvic anatomy , preserve urinary , intestinal , sexual function , low rate recurrence complication . In history surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse vaginal abdominal approach perform . In spite decrease morbidity short hospitalisation advantage vaginal procedure , consistently low long-term success rate compare abdominal sacrocolpopexy . In contrast , abdominal approach consider gold standard surgical correction vaginal vault prolapse , report long-term efficacy rate . However , associate morbidity open laparotomy make procedure less favourable . In effort overcome drawback , minimally invasive laparoscopic approach adopt . However , rigidity laparoscopic instrumentation make intracorporeal suture dissection narrow pelvis challenge . Robot-assisted technology , stereoscopic vision use instrument easily move wrist movement , offer ergonomic platform simplifies complex laparoscopic task widely adopt pelvic surgeon . Most complication follow sacrocolpopexy occur either open minimally invasive approach , typically similar rate . Bladder injury , postoperative void dysfunction low urinary tract symptom may occur . Lower urinary tract symptom may develop postoperatively reason still clearly understood . De nova low urinary tract symptom may appear laparoscopic robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy range 0 % 27 % . As urinary system complication , bowel complication ( bowel injury , bowel dysfunction ) may occur intraoperatively postoperatively . Constipation mostly report range 0 % 19 % . Retroperitonealization mesh use laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy think reduce risk bowel injury , although author note lack bowel injury mesh leave exposed peritoneum .</detailed_description>
