	<brief_summary>At time , standardization knee trauma care child . Each physician free resort radiography verify dispel bone fracture , depend radiographic device availability . This decision base trauma severity , clinical feature , physician experience . Knee traumatisms common reason consultation . In emergency department , radiographic use widespread traumatisms , private practice . Most knee traumatisms include soft tissue lesion , radiography give detail . Yet , radiography expose bone fracture may require specific orthopaedic care . Then , seem beneficial highlight simple reproducible clinical criterion order identify severe knee traumatisms , require radiography ass bone fracture . Those criterion sensibility close 1 , high specificity . Such criterion could significantly decrease number radiography thus irradiation , emergency wait time , consultation expense without miss bone fracture . Ottawa knee rule adult : age 55 year old , tenderness head fibula , isolated tenderness patella inability flex 90Â° , inability bear weight 4 step immediately emergency department . Presence one criterion require front profile radiography ass bone fracture . However , study conduct among child , confirm use criterion target fracture screening . Data contradictory allow conclude criterion could benefit child . Moreover , study consider adult clinical criterion . This study would first implement specific paediatric criterion , make study original .</brief_summary>
