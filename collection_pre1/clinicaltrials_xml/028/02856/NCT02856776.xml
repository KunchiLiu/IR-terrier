	<detailed_description>Vitamin D require two metabolic conversion , 25-hydroxylation liver 1Î±-hydroxylation kidney , hormonal form , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ] , bind vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) modulate gene transcription . The VDR present wide variety cell tissue 1,25 ( OH ) 2D via receptor directly indirectly report effect cell cycle proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis production cathelicidin , renin insulin . It estimate VDR activation may regulate directly and/or indirectly expression large number gene ( 0.5-5 % total human genome i.e. , 100-1250 gene ) . Early microarray study perform squamous carcinoma osteoblast cell reveal 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 regulated expression numerous gene include implicate immune function . Although numerous observation vitamin D deficiency link chronic disease , study person 's vitamin D status improvement vitamin D supplementation affect genomic expression vivo human report recently observe small pilot study supplementation healthy adult vitamin D significantly affect expression 291 gene link 80 different metabolic pathway . This small randomize control double blind study fund CTSI register Clinical Trials.gov ( NCT01696409 ) include 2 group . Group 1 receive 400 IUs vitamin D3 ( 400 IUs time study 2010 IOM release new recommendation ) consider control group group 2 receive 2000 IUs vitamin D3 daily 2 month winter . Comparing gene expression two group ( deficient vs. insufficient sufficient ) lead u study effect vitamin D status well vitamin D supplementation genome-wide gene expression . To explore gene-expression relationship within 400 IU 2000 IU group , principal component analysis ( PCA ) perform . We observe trend gene expression subject receive 400 2000 IUs vitamin D3 . There however trend large change expression gene group receive 2000 IUs vitamin D3/d compare group receive 400 IUs vitamin D3/d . Regarding participant , false discovery rate ( FDR ) &lt; 0.1 , 1.5 fold change , 291 gene find statistically significant difference expression baseline follow-up vitamin D3 supplementation . There least 1.5 fold inhibition 82 gene ( top ~30 % heat map ) whose expression dramatically reduce least 1.5 fold induction 209 gene ( bottom ~70 % heat map ) whose expression significantly increase supplementation either 400 2000 IU vitamin D3 2 month . For verification gene observe expression affect vitamin D supplementation occur expression change evaluate real-time PCR four gene include CD83 , TNFAIP3 , KLF10 SBDS . The gene expression change concordant observed microarray analysis . This subgroup analysis baseline gene expression 291 gene vitamin D deficient group compare vitamin D insufficient/sufficient group reveal , expression 66 gene significantly different two group ( p &lt; 0.01 fold change &gt; 1.5 ) . There least 1.5 fold increase gene expression ( brown-orange ) 14 gene least 1.5 fold decrease expression ( yellow-white ) 52 gene vitamin D deficient adult compare vitamin D insufficient sufficient baseline . After vitamin D3 supplementation gene expression vitamin D deficient group similar vitamin D insufficient/sufficient group . To learn gene affect vitamin D3 supplementation contain VDR bind domain near transcriptional start site ( TSS ) , perform VDRE analysis . Of 66 gene influence least 1.5 fold expression baseline serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration,17 gene significantly change vitamin D3 supplementation deficient insufficient/sufficient group ( p &lt; 0.01 ) select VDRE analysis . We find least one candidate VDRE upstream region within 30 kb TSS 17 gene . For example , candidate VDRE coatomer protein complex , subunit beta 2 ( COPB2 ) , gene stimulate least 1.5 fold vitamin D3 supplementation , two hexameric bind motif associate VDRE . Twelve housekeep gene serve negative control . There sequence candidate VDREs 100 kb upstream TSS housekeeping gene expression housekeep gene vitamin D3 supplementation change . VDR present wide variety cell tissue , particular prominent cell involve innate adaptive immunity ; especially CD8+ T lymphocytes.These immune cell find throughout body include part digestive tract . In particular , upper GI tract ( include pyloric antrum duodenum ) great concentration CD8+ T cell relative rest GI tract . Studies find increase vitamin D intake reduction opportunistic pathogen increase gut microbiome . Through action vitamin D CD8+ T cell , increase immune response gammaproteobacteria allow gut microbiome flourish . This study find although upper GI tract generate great change microbiome secondary vitamin D supplementation , rest GI tract stool also display change . Gut microbiome important general health maintenance . For example , change gut microbiota associate early onset Type 2 - Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) . Thus , possible understand prevalence VDR expression immune cell individual observe microbiota gut/stool . The objective propose project expand preliminary data well-defined group healthy adult age 18-50 year BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 vitamin D insufficient 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 29 ng/mL There continue debate much vitamin D adult require vitamin D sufficient . A multitude association study suggest improve serum 25 ( OH ) D &gt; 30 ng/mL may reduce risk many chronic illness improve immune function . 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ] may regulate least 2000 gene . Our recent pilot study evaluate effect vitamin D status vitamin D supplementation broad gene expression reveal many 291 gene influence vitamin D3 supplementation . Aim : Define Dynamic Changes PTH , Broad Gene Expression Circulating Immune Cells , metabolomics , microbiome profile Response Varying Doses Vitamin D Supplementation . The hypothesis test serum 25 ( OH ) D level increase result vitamin D supplementation gradual decline PTH level . Furthermore expect continue alteration gene expression , metabolomic protein level gut microbiome dose increase 10,000 IUs daily whereas PTH level plateau dose 4000 IUs daily remain dose escalate 10,000 IUs daily . This study last 24 week blood , urine , stool sample obtain baseline 8 week interval evaluate time course change 25 ( OH ) D , PTH level , gene expression , determine change remain constant continue change vitamin D supplementation . We conduct metabolomics profile blood urine well determine microbiome change stool previously describe . In addition , one arm study include group receive 600 IUs first 8 week follow 4000 IUs next 8 week follow 10,000 IUs vitamin D3 final 8 week determine whether continued increase vitamin D intake adult continue alter gene expression , metabolomics activity , microbiome change , also influence PTH level . Although IOM 's UL vitamin D adult 4000 IU/D Endocrine Society recognize 10,000 IUs/D safe healthy adult 5 month . In addition recent study report adult take 20,000 IUs/D least one year never raise blood level 250 nmol/L i.e . 100 ng/mL consider IOM , Endocrine Society many reference laboratory upper limit normal . Results study provide new insight much vitamin D healthy adult require maximize calcium bone metabolism expression gene relate immune system biologic pathway blood , urine , stool .</detailed_description>
