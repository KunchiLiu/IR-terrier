The aim study evaluate benefit eye mask earplugs reduce delirium ass associate outcomes length stay , use sedating medication , morbidity , mortality . The benefit improve sleep quality , intervention associate reduction risk delirium . Detailed Description : Patients eligible study include patient admit either Surgical ICU ( SICU ) stepdown unit , care SICU care team , begin 8/1/16 . Consent obtain patient family member study personnel . Data collect include diagnosis admission , surgery perform respective date , length stay SICU step-down unit , use sedate medication , Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) result . Subjects also ask fill 2 separate questionnaire quality sleep . The first questionnaire administer enrollment second questionnaire administer upon discharge SICU . The rate compliance use earplug eye mask also assess mean calendar checklist displayed patient 's bedside . These outcome compare historical control group undergo intervention . The investigator aim enroll 100 subject control group another 100 patient retrospectively select matched patient previous year ( 8/1/15 - 8/1/16 ) , implementation intervention . The remainder patient data collect mean retrospective chart review .</detailed_description>
