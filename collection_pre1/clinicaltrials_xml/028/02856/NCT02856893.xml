	<brief_summary>The phase II APPLE trial give opportunity prospectively validate liquid biopsy new standard test tumor progression compare conventional radiological procedure EGFR mutant advance NSCLC patient . Moreover base sequential T790M test treatment investigator assess predictive value liquid biopsy . APPLE trial examine best strategy deliver osimertinib ( upfront versus sequential treatment 1st generation EGFR TKI ) EGFR mutant NSCLC patient . Finally , trial also explore mechanism acquire resistance Osimertinib base result optional biopsy upon progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective To evaluate best strategy deliver Osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) NSCLC patient EGFR mutation . The objective assess Progression Free Survival rate 18 month ( PFS-18 ) . Secondary objective - To evaluate PFS Osimertinib measure randomization RECIST criterion 1.1 [ Ref 33 ] . - To evaluate PFS measure switch Osimertinib RECIST criterion 1.1 [ Ref 33 ] . - To determine proportion patient receive Osimertinib base determination cfDNA T790M mutation positive . - To evaluate time symptomatic brain metastasis patient presence brain metastasis study entry . - To evaluate PFS-2 ( define sum PFS Gefitinib PFS Osimertinib treatment ) . - To evaluate Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) Osimertinib . - To evaluate Treatment duration . - To evaluate Time progression ( TTP ) Osimertinib ( measure switch osimertinib ) . - To evaluate Overall Survival ( OS ) . - To evaluate time brain progression ( TTBP ) . - Safety .</detailed_description>
