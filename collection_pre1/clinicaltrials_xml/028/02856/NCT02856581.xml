	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase III trial evaluate varenicline vs. placebo reduction post-surgical complication 24 week surgery lung cancer patient undergo surgery motivate stop smoking . A parallel group design utilize two-arm study : varenicline vs. placebo . Both arm also include brief smoking message surgical team NCI Quitline . Patients stratify two group base type resection plan : minimally invasive ( could include lobectomy robotic surgery ) . The primary secondary objective provide . Primary Objective : To determine varenicline plus behavioral intervention consist brief clinician-delivered intervention tobacco quitline follow-up , decrease postsurgical complication 24 week surgery compare placebo plus behavioral intervention lung cancer patient undergo surgery motivate stop smoking . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To compare change baseline 12 24 week surgery patient quality life ( LASA-12 ) domains intervention ( varenicline ) control group ( placebo ) . 2 . To compare change baseline 6 , 12 24 week surgery patient quality life related domains PHQ-9 SEQ12 intervention control group . 3 . To compare proportion patient 12 week 24 week surgery endorse ( `` Was It Worth It '' ) treatment ( intervention vs. control group ) . 4 . To compare post-operative care ( measure length hospital high dependency unit stay ) intervention control group . 5 . To compare treatment adherence intervention control group . 6 . To compare rate smoke abstinence intervention control group covariate primary outcome .</detailed_description>
