	<brief_summary>Over 1.37 million Caesarian section ( C-sections ) perform annually US . It estimate 12-20 % result chronic scar pain . This pain lead functional difficulty perform activity daily live , pain bowel movement , pain sexual activity . There anecdotal evidence support use deep fascial scar mobilization technique reduce abdominal surgical scar pain , yet almost research publish . The aim randomize clinical trial determine deep fascial scar mobilization technique superficial scar mobilization technique improve chronic pain result functional deficit , threshold pressure discomfort , pressure tolerance mobility restriction result C-section surgery see intervention effective intervention . A positive result may result increase use intervention thus reduction chronic scar pain many woman ; may provide justification insurance reimbursement approach also pave way investigation use technique type painful scar include hysterectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fascial Scar Mobilization Techniques Treating Chronic Caesarian Section Scar Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Thirty six subject recruit history C-section surgery three month enter study report chronic pain around scar stem surgery . Subjects initially test twice four week apart , begin intervention . This allow establishment baseline subject part baseline control group . They randomly assign one two treatment group . Group 1 undergo four , 25 minute session light massage trunk follow superficial skin roll C-section scar . Group 2 undergo four , 25-minute treatment session consist multi-planar pelvic abdominal myofascial mobilization technique direct scar mobilization techniques.. Outcomes : Outcome measure include threshold pressure discomfort pressure tolerance use Pressure Algometer , Adheremeter measurement scar mobility , numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , Hip extension shoulder flexion measure via goniometery , Global rating Change scale . Follow measure collect four week follow start intervention 12 week . In addition qualitative data collect subject . The treat therapist blind result outcome measure .</detailed_description>
