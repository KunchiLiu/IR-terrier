	<brief_summary>The purpose present study compare safety efficacy 2 injection NKA give 3 6 month apart ( maximum ) subject randomize receive first treatment soon NKA product make available versus subject randomize undergo contemporaneous , standard-of-care treatment CKD first 12 18 month prior receive 2 injection NKA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Autologous Neo-Kidney Augment™ ( NKA ) Type 2 Diabetics With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NKA make expand autologous select renal cell obtain individual subject 's kidney biopsy . To manufacture NKA , biopsy tissue enrol subject sent Twin City Bio LLC , whose facility renal cell expand SRC select . SRC formulate gelatin-based hydrogel concentration 100 x 106 cells/mL , package 10 mL syringe , ship clinical site . Based preclinical data , dose NKA 3 x 106 cells/g estimate kidney weight ( g KWest ) . Since concentration SRC per mL NKA 100 x 106 cells/mL , dose volume 3.0 mL 100 g kidney weight . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) Active Treatment Group Deferred Treatment Group follow renal biopsy . Subjects Active Treatment Group receive first NKA injection soon NKA product manufacture shipped clinical site . After 3 month ( +12 week ) , second injection give , appropriate . In contrast , subject `` Deferred Treatment Group '' undergo period observation renal biopsy . During time , receive contemporaneous , standard-of-care therapy CKD undergo follow-up evaluation every 3 month similar subject Active Treatment Group . After 12-18 month ( maximum ) , subject Deferred Treatment Group receive series two NKA injection give 3 month ( +12 week ) apart , appropriate . Consequently , study design include randomize control group receive standard-of-care treatment first 12-18 month randomize , active treatment group receive two NKA injection follow-up evaluation period time . In addition , subject 's baseline rate renal decline , base adequate historical , clinical data obtain 18 month prior NKA injection , serve comparator monitor rate progression renal insufficiency time . The rate progression renal insufficiency Active Treatment Group ( assess via serial measurement eGFR pre-randomization 12 month last NKA injection ) compare Deferred Treatment Group ( ie , contemporaneous control group ) . In addition , subject 's baseline rate eGFR decline ( derived adequate historical , clinical data ) compare individual subject 's rate eGFR decline 12 month follow final NKA treatment . The rate progression renal insufficiency subject ( ) receive single NKA injection may compare subject receive two NKA injection . Subjects complete KDQOL survey , kidney-specific measure health-related quality life ( ie , Kidney Disease Quality Life™ [ KDQOL™-36 ] Version 1 ) . Scores Active Treatment Group compare score Deferred Treatment Group . Subjects Deferred Treatment Group comprise contemporaneous control group analysis KDQOL score . In addition , subject 's baseline score compare individual subject 's KDQOL score obtain 12 month last NKA injection . Additionally , KDQOL score subject receive single NKA injection may compare score subject receive two injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The subject male female , 30 80 year age date inform consent . 2 . The subject establish diagnosis T2DM . 3 . The subject establish diagnosis diabetic nephropathy underlying cause renal disease . 4 . The subject establish diagnosis CKD require renal dialysis , define eGFR 20 50 mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive Screening Visit prior NKA injection . 5 . The subject urine albumin excretion great equal 30 mg/day . 6 . The subject blood pressure le 140/90 Screening Visit , prior renal biopsy , prior NKA injection ( ) . Note BP significantly 115/70 . 7 . The subject stable blood pressure ongoing stable treatment angiotensin convertingenzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) initiate least 8 week prior renal biopsy . Treatment must stable 6week period immediately prior NKA injection . Stable treatment define dose adjustment less onehalf current dosage 2 time current dosage . Dose interruption 7 day due medical necessity allow . A subject intolerant ACEI ARBs may include long he/she stable blood pressure within specify limit . 8 . A minimum 2 measurement eGFR sCr obtain least 3 month apart prior Screening Visit within previous 18 month define rate progression CKD . The subject adequate , historical clinical data provide reasonable estimate rate progression CKD follow consultation Medical Monitor ( ensure sufficient data ) . 9 . The subject willing able refrain NSAID consumption ( include aspirin ) well clopidogrel , prasugrel , platelet inhibitor period begin 7 day 7 day renal biopsy NKA injection ( ) . 10 . The subject willing able refrain consumption fish oil platelet aggregation inhibitor , dipryridamole ( ie , Persantine® ) , period begin 7 day 7 day renal biopsy NKA injection ( ) . 11 .
