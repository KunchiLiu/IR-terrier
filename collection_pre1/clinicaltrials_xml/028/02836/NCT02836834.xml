	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass safety tolerability JS-001 subject various advanced recurrent malignancy , include solid tumor lymphomas , evaluate preliminary efficacy . The secondary objective : 1 ) characterize single-dose multi-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile JS-001 , 2 ) characterize immunogenicity JS-001 ; 3 ) ass dose-efficacy relationship JS-001 single agent , 4 ) preliminarily evaluate biomarkers associate efficacy JS-001 . The exploratory objective include evaluate consistency biomarker detection result archive tissue fresh frozen tissue , assess consistency response use various response criterion ( irRC , WHO , RECIST irRECIST ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW This Phase 1 , open-label , dose-escalation study JS-001 , humanize monoclonal IgG4 antibody target Programmed Death -1 ( PD-1 ) . It estimate 27-54 subject advance recurrent solid tumor lymphomas enrol study . A 3+3 design utilized Phase 1 study . Four dose level plan include : 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 10 mg/kg/dose . The first dose level pilot cohort include two subject receive single dose JS-001 . Each 3 dose level use 3 dose schedule : single dose , repeat dos every 2 week , repeat dos every 3 week . Subjects assign dose schedule order study entry . Except first dose level , study traditional 3 + 3 design 3 6 subject treat dose level subsequent dose level depend upon incidence DLTs . If DLTs occur cohort 3 subject , new cohort 3 subject treat next high dose level . If 1 3 subject cohort experience DLT , cohort expand 6 subject . If 1 6 subject DLT , next cohort 3 subject treat next high dose level . If 2 DLTs occur within cohort , dose level MTD ( high dose 1 6 subject experienced DLT ) , previous low ( tolerate ) dose level consider MTD . A DLT define Grade 3 drug-related adverse event occur within first cycle ( 28 day ) dosing ( exclude tumor flare define local pain , irritation , rash localize site know suspected tumor transient Grade 3 infusion adverse event ) use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 single dose cohort . Tumor response evaluate use immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) , WHO criteria , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , immune-related RECIST , International Workshop Standardize Response Criteria non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas ( lymphoma ) . In absence confirm disease progression intolerable toxicity , subject single dose cohort multiple dose cohort allow continue JS-001 administration consent subject . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION JS-001 administer 60-minute i.v . infusion . Cohorts include escalate dose level 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 10mg/kg/dose . SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment safety determine vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory test , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status evaluation , diagnostic imaging , physical examination , electrocardiogram , incidence severity adverse event . Safety also include evaluation immune safety immunogenicity . Particular attention give adverse event may follow enhance T-cell activation dermatitis colitis , uveitis , immune-related adverse event ( irAEs ) . An irAE clinically significant adverse event organ associate drug exposure , unknown etiology , consistent immune-mediated mechanism . EFFICACY EVALUATIONS The primary efficacy endpoint best response rate ( RR ) . Duration response , progression-free survival , time progression , overall survival also analyze . PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameter include AUC , Cmax , tmax , tÂ½ , etc . STATISTICAL METHODS The sample size study determine power analysis . It base 3+3 design dose escalation safety evaluation requirement . Descriptive statistic include : mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum value continuous variable ; frequency percentages categorical variable . The efficacy parameter summarize use descriptive statistic . All safety pharmacokinetic parameter summarize use descriptive statistic .</detailed_description>
