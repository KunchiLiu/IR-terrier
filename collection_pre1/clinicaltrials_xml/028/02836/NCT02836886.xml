	<brief_summary>This study use technique , call `` VirCapSeq-VERT '' analyze white blood cell patient Sézary syndrome . This could provide foundation future study look understand role virus play origin Sézary syndrome . This could important implication future development new effective therapy disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterize malignant CD4+ T-cells infiltrate skin . While case confine skin , CTCL also capable affect blood , lymph node , visceral organ . Sézary Syndrome ( SS ) leukemic variant disease poor prognosis arise without cutaneous involvement . The pathogenesis CTCL poorly understand , chronic antigen stimulation possibly due bacterial viral infection colonization skin may lead malignant transformation skin resident T cell . Colonization skin CTCL patient Staphylococcus aureus common lead clonal expansion malignant T cell skin . However , role etiological agent unlikely , consider commonality S.aureus rarity skin T-cell lymphoma . Mounting evidence suggest oncogenic viral pathogen may play role , effort implicate certain virus , retroviruses herpesviruses yield inconsistent result . This study use sensitive method date , novel viral detection technique capable detecting every know vertebrate virus tissue sample , call `` Virome Capture Sequencing Platform Vertebrate Viruses ( VirCapSeq-VERT ) . '' This allow detect previously undiscovered virus diverge know sequence much 40 % .</detailed_description>
