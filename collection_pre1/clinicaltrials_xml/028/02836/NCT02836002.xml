	<brief_summary>This single-center , open label study . The primary aim project develop control human malaria infection transmission model ( `` CHMI-trans '' ) `` challenge model '' evaluate capacity vaccine , biologics ( monoclonal antibody , mAbs ) , drug block malaria parasite transmission assess infectiousness Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) gametocyte carrier Anopheles mosquito .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malaria Infection Model Evaluation Transmission‐Blocking Interventions - Study 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 32 volunteer randomly assign four group ( n=8 ) subject standard control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) deliver five Pf-infected mosquito ( 3D7 clone ) . Treatment subsequently initiate induce gametocytaemia ( treatment 1 , DT1 ) clear pathogenic asexual parasite whilst leave gametocyte unaffected ( treatment 2 , DT2 ) . At end study , treatment parasite stage provide follow national treatment guideline ( end treatment , ET ) . Once malaria infection detect 18S qPCR positive ( day treatment 1 [ DT1 ] ) , group 1 2 treated course subcurative sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) ( SP low , 500mg/25mg ) . Groups 3 4 receive piperaquine ( Pip ) low-dose ( Pip low , 480 mg ) . After DT1 , volunteer receive curative treatment ( DT2 ) recrudescence asexual parasitaemia occur day 21 post challenge infection , whichever come first . Volunteers group 1 ( SP low/SP high ) treat sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( 1000mg/50mg ) group 2 ( SP low/Pip high ) piperaquine ( 960mg ) . Volunteers group 3 ( Pip low/Pip high ) treat piperaquine ( 960mg ) group 4 ( Pip low/SP high ) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( 1000mg/50mg ) . To ensure radical clearance parasite stage , volunteer receive final treatment ( ET ) accord national guideline atovaquone/proguanil ( Malarone® ) day 42 . Daily blood sample allow detailed quantification gametocyte , gametocyte sex ratio ex vivo assessment gametocyte fitness .</detailed_description>
