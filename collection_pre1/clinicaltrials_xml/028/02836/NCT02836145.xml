	<brief_summary>Female urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse common diseases especially age woman frequently cause urogenital infection , void difficulty , urinary retention , pelvic pain , constipation , coital difficulty , well impact quality life woman . Risk factor diseases include pregnancy , vaginal delivery , menopausal status . Despite play crucial role pathophysiology disease , urogenital skeletal muscular dysfunction fully correct via current treatment modality . The human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSCs ) represent prime candidate cell type current research future cell therapy significant self-renewal , differentiation potential relative lack ethical conflict . With advent efficient technology reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) hiPSCs , researcher generate personalize line cell possible obtain differentiated cell less invasive way , introduce opportunity treat disease consider incurable . Until recently , little success achieve term skeletal muscle differentiation hiPSCs . The purpose study explore applicability differentiation skeletal muscle progenitor cell hiPSC cell line associate biomolecular message . It anticipate derived skeletal muscle progenitor cell reprogrammed PBMCs female patient urinary incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse use preclinical test relieve female urogenital problem .</brief_summary>
