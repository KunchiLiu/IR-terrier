	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Dexmedetomidine After Intra-nasal Dosing Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective study plasma concentration intranasal ( 1 µg/kg 2µg/kg ) intravenous ( 1 µg /kg ) DEX determine early pharmacokinetics ( maximum concentration ( peak ) time peak ) bioavailability single intranasal dose pediatric patient . Dexmedetomidine sedation commonly utilized Cincinnati Children 's Medical Center ( CCHMC ) pediatric institution . This compound deliver intravenously intranasally sedation child without congenital heart disease . Intranasal DEX , though effective sedation , significant variability onset peak effect . Patient care significantly improve factor determine variability onset peak effect determine . Investigators determine important early clinical variable peak plasma DEX concentration ( Tmax Cmax ) 0 - 2 hour bioavailability intranasal DEX child .</detailed_description>
