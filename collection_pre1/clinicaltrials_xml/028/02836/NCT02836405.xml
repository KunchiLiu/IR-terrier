	<brief_summary>The main purpose study brain plasticity ( change occur brain experience ) individual autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Research suggest development , brain individual ASD may change response experience differently brain typically developing individual . Investigators want understand difference may contribute symptom ASD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMS Investigation Brain Plasticity Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) diagnose clinically , base key symptom . As ASD phenotypic variability large , symptoms manifest different age degree , clinical diagnosis challenge . To date , remain unmet need valid reliable endophenotype would facilitate ASD diagnosis early life , enable efficient study ASD risk factor , eventually serve useful biomarker inform development effective therapy assess treatment response future clinical trial . As compare behavioral neuroimaging method , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) offer advantage provide behaviorally independent result largely unaffected attention cognitive ability . Therefore , TMS base endophenotype may applicable individual across autism spectrum . At Boston Children 's Hospital , subject 's participation study consist four visit : two screen visit , two TMS session . At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , subject 's participation consist three visit : one screen visit , two TMS session . Each screen visit expect last 2-3 hour , participant first provide inform consent . Participants receive thorough medical examination neurologist , neuropsychological evaluation ( include IQ measure ASD specific evaluation ) . If eligible continue , participant come back two identical TMS visit , space 1-5 week apart . These visit expect last 3-4 hour , include TMS measure brain plasticity .</detailed_description>
