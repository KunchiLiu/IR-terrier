	<detailed_description>1 . Aims study Starting study address effectiveness communication skill train program oncology , current project aim conduct randomize longitudinal study ass efficacy intensive communication skill train program address uncertainty hope oncology design physician . This efficacy assess analyze physician ' acquisition communication skill address uncertainty hope encounter simulate advanced stage cancer patient validate tools questionnaire . 2 . State art In last decade , major development achieve oncological care . Cancer patient family confront various treatment , include personalize approach involve multidisciplinary care . These development allow get cancer status chronical disease , put numerous patient course alternate treatment phase remission phase . Numerous cancer patient also confront long term treatment aim control advance disease . These development support patient ' physician ' hope increase life-expectancy . At time , lead frequently face contexts high uncertainty regard prognosis expect unexpected effect cancer treatment . Although context complex term communication , study yet conduct ass efficacy communication train program address specifically uncertainty hope oncology design physician . 3 . Study protocol 3.1 . Subjects To include study , physicians speak French willing participate research program . The physician ( n=72 ) include oncologist , specialist , resident least one year experience work cancer patient ( part-time full-time ) . Recruitment give priority physician work Jules Bordet Institute . The local ethic committee approve study participant provide write informed consent . 3.2 . Study design Participating physician randomize two group . The first group 36 physician immediately attend train program ( experimental group ) . The second group 36 physician attend train delay manner ( control group ) . Comparison experimental group control group allow highlight impact train communicational , physiological psychological variable record context encounter simulate advanced stage cancer patient . For experimental group , first record take place first train session second recording last session . For control group , first second record take place four-month interval . 3.3 . Communication skills train program The general aim training program help physicians learn effective communication skill contexts high uncertainty . The specific aim train program help physician talk uncertainty cancer patient support hope ; improve general physician ' communication 's skill ; optimize physician/patient relationship ; help patient well cope uncertainty ; increase physician ' consciousness regard reaction uncertainty . The training last 30 hour , spread 4 month . This program involve 10 3-hours session schedule accord participant wish . To increase training accessibility physician facilitate participation , train conduct group 3 subject . The training include mainly role-plays , theoretical information model technique . A training manual develop increase content standardization reduce potential group trainee bias . The role-plays base clinical case bring participant . The communication skill teach base psychodynamics , cognitive-behavioral systemic theory . The training staff highly specialized caregiver/patient communication training program oncology ( Y. Libert S. Marchal ) . 3.4 . Assessment procedure In cancer care , patient ' performance status , disease status communication behavior widely vary . To reduce variability , use standardize simulated patient encounter recommend assess efficacy communication skill train program design health care professional . The assessment procedure current study involve record encounter simulate advanced stage cancer patient . For experimental group , first record take place first train session second recording last session . For control group , first second record take place four month ' interval . Participating physician assess individually . An investigator , involved training program , present every subject self-assessment scale experimental task associate record . The assessment procedure include 6 step : relaxation exercise , first completion set psychological questionnaire , read simulate patient medical file , second completion set psychological questionnaire , conduction simulate encounter , third completion set psychological questionnaire , . 3.4.1 . Simulated patient encounter The simulated case create medical oncology unit psycho-oncology clinic cancer center ( Jules Bordet Institute , Brussels , Belgium ) . This simulated case develop order increase physician ' uncertainty medico-psycho-social component available evidence-based treatment . The simulated patient choose study 36-year-old woman advance cancer . She face third recurrence ( hepatic metastasis ) breast cancer previously treat surgery , hormone therapy , radiation therapy chemotherapy . She decide start new chemotherapy treatment near future . For assessment procedure , physician instruct asked meet physician order help well cope therapeutic decision . During encounter , physician instruct address concern simulate patient , maintain professional identity take time need . The simulated patient play actress experience simulated patient encounter . She train maintain standardized script behavior encounter . Regular feedback session organize help actress maintain reproducibility . During simulated patient encounter , actress instruct explicitly express four concern : fear death near future ; fear chemotherapy start soon effective regard disease progression ; fear suffer major depression relapse ; general fear less available child next week . She instruct express moderate anxiety concern . The simulated patient encounter organize communication lab Centre de Psycho-Oncologie ( Brussels ) . 3.4.2 . Psychological questionnaire Participating physician ask fill first set psychological questionnaire read simulated patient medical file : perceive mastery communication skill address hope uncertainty oncology ( specific questionnaire ) ; perceive stress ( Visual Analogic Scale ) . Participating physician ask fill second set psychological questionnaire immediately conduct simulated encounter : perceive stress ( Visual Analogic Scale ) ; agreement therapeutic decision record simulated patient medical file ( specific questionnaire ) ; perceive realism information record simulated patient medical file ( specific questionnaire ) ; self-efficacy perceive outcome expectancy regard communication skill address uncertainty hope could use conduct simulated encounter ( specific questionnaire ) ; perceive stress ( Visual Analogic Scale ) . Finally , participate physician ask fill third set psychological questionnaire immediately conduct simulated encounter : perceive stress ( Visual Analogic Scale ) ; satisfaction communication performance encounter ( specific questionnaire ) ; perceive mastery regard communication skill address uncertainty hope use conducting simulated encounter ( specific questionnaire ) ; perceive stress ( Visual Analogic Scale ) . 3.4.3 . Communication content analyse The simulated encounter audio record transcribed . Physicians ' communication skill analyze use three tool . A French communication content analysis software , LaComm ( Centre de Psycho-Oncologie , Brussels , Belgium ; http : //www.lacomm.be/ ) software analyze verbal communication ( medicine general oncology particular ) utterance utterance identifies turn speech type content utterance . The explanation software work detailed previous publication . The Multidimensional analysis Patient Outcome Predictions ( MD.POP ) reliable tool use measure verbal expression address clinical future patient medical encounter . This cod system allow one manually identify , code , score detail verbal content medical encounter transcript inform patient 's clinical future . The detailed MD.POP codebook available upon request . Finally , specific interaction-process analysis system assess communication skill address hope uncertainty develop study . 3.4.4 . Physiological assessment Throughout assessment procedure , physician ' heart rate record order assess impact train program physiological arousal associate way address uncertainty hope simulate patient . This recording procedure previously use assess effect communication skill train resident ' physiological arousal break bad news simulate task . 3.5 . Data sample data analysis Training efficacy assess high frequency facilitate communication strategy address hope uncertainty ( 10 % ) , use participate physician simulated encounter , good definition behavioral intention higher physician ' satisfaction decision encounter . A 72 assessable physician sample would bring enough statistical power detect difference . To evaluate training effect , group-by-time effect assess use generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) regression model . Dependent variable identify normal , binomial , Poisson , binomial negative distribution appropriate . All test two-tailed , alpha set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
