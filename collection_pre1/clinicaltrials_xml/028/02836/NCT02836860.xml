	<brief_title>Effects Tactile Stimuli Lumbar Multifidus Muscle Activation Healthy Adults Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced lumbar multifidus muscle contraction observe patient low back pain ( LBP ) . Currently , considerable evidence support spinal stabilization exercise treat LBP , include lumbar multifidus muscle activation exercise . Clinicians often apply tactile stimulation muscle addition verbal instruction ensure muscle activation . However , whether addition tactile stimulation would increase muscle activation study . Therefore , investigator plan use electromyography ( EMG ) examine addition tactile stimulation verbal instruction would increase lumbar multifidus muscle activation healthy adult patient LBP . The purpose study compare combine tactile stimulation verbal instruction verbal instruction lumbar multifidus muscle activation asymptomatic healthy adult patient LBP . The research hypothesis lumbar multifidus muscle activation increase participant give combine tactile stimulation verbal instruction compare participant give verbal instruction . Participants : Eligible participant English-speaking adult 18 year age old . Additional criterion asymptomatic healthy adult include exist LBP LBP past year . Additional criterion patient participant include exist LBP near L5-S1 level average pain intensity score ≥ 2/10 past 24 hour ( numeric pain rating scale 0-10 , 0 pain , 10 unbearable pain ) . Exclusion criteria participant include previous low back surgery , systemic joint disease ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis ) , cancer lower quadrant , neurological disorder , allergic reaction ultrasound gel , inability obtain testing position ( prone lie ) . The investigator plan enroll 20 asymptomatic healthy adult , 20 patient LBP . Potential participant recruit local community ( include limit Texas Woman 's University - Dallas ) via flyer . The flyer post TWU - Dallas campus community center approval . Participants interested take part study ask call investigator schedule appointment time test . The consent form present begin appointment . Procedures : After participant informed risk , benefit procedure study , ask sign write consent form approve TWU Institutional Review Board - Dallas . Eligible participant ask complete intake form , ask age , gender , past medical history . For participant exist low back pain , ask pain location , duration , intensity , nature , medicine use exist LBP LBP history . Instrumentation 1 . The Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Index ( OSW ) questionnaire use determine individual 's perceived disability function limitation due his/her low back pain . The OSW questionnaire show reliable valid . 2 . A Delsys EMG system 2 wireless surface electrode ( Delsys Inc. , Boston , MA ) use obtain muscle activity . The bandwidth EMG system set 20 450 Hz gain 1,000 . The EMG signal record sample rate 1,000 Hz . Each surface electrode built-in reference electrode . EMG Recording Prior EMG recording , anatomy location lumbar multifidus muscle explain show participant use model picture . Next , participant lie prone examination table arm side . A pillow place participant 's abdomen flatten lumbar lordotic curve inclinometer place lumbosacral junction ensure lumbar curve ≤10 degree . The spinous process L4-S2 sacral sulcus identify palpation mark erasable pen . Next , one investigator prepare participant 's skin area 2 electrode placement . The skin clean isopropyl alcohol . If excessive hair , new disposable razor use shave hair improve quality EMG recording . If shaving require , investigator wear glove perform shave follow universal precaution . Once skin prepared EMG recording , 2 electrode place skin right leave lumbar multifidus two L4-5 level . The EMG lumbar multifidus record 3 time `` rest '' first prior muscle activation condition : ( 1 ) verbal instruction , ( 2 ) combine tactile stimulation verbal instruction . For muscle activation condition , participant ask assume start position : abduct contralateral shoulder flex contralateral elbow approximately 90° . The contralateral side opposite painful side patient LBP leave side asymptomatic participant . If patient bilateral LBP , contralateral side less painful side . During verbal instruction , one investigator give verbal instruction ask participant perform contralateral-arm task , participant lift contralateral arm approximately 5 cm table hold 5 second . The verbal instruction select base publish pilot study show instruction seem activate lumbar multifidus muscle : `` Breathe normally , without move pelvis spine , think tilt pelvis forward without actually move , lift leave ( right ) arm '' . During tactile stimulation , investigator place his/her middle 2 3 finger lumbar multifidus L5-S1 2 electrode verbal instruction give . The investigator give verbal instruction ask participant perform contralateral-arm-lift task maintain finger contact multifidus muscle muscle activation . EMG test start verbal instruction complete . For muscle activation condition , participant hold contraction 5-8 second , 10-minute rest give 2 contraction condition .</detailed_description>
