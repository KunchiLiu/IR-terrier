	<brief_summary>To evaluate effectiveness safety HIT Hip Replacement System ( HHRS ) patient undergo total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . Effectiveness evaluate use patient-reported , clinical , radiologic , radiostereometric outcome . Safety evaluate collection device-related unanticipated device-related adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hip Replacement System ( HRS-P ) Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HIT Hip Replacement System ( HHRS ) Metal-on-Polyethylene ( MoP ) conventional hip prosthesis design improve stability reduce risk dislocation . The HHRS consist femoral stem , acetabular cup cobalt-chrome ( CoCrMo ) ball articulates within polyethylene liner . The ball sit acetabular cup , polyethylene liner attach femoral cup , attach femoral stem , instead acetabular cup . The acetabular component HHRS consist hemispherical acetabular shell cluster screw-hole design . The outside shell coat titanium plasma facilitate bone in-growth provide secure intermediate fixation prepare bone surface site implantation . The acetabular cup 3-hole design accommodates three titanium alloy bone screw . Inside acetabular cup male taper assembly acetabular ball . The femoral component consist femoral stem manufacture titanium mating cobalt chrome femoral cup line highly cross-linked UHMWPE . As acetabular cup , femoral stem porous coat use plasma spray pure titanium , intend facilitate bone in-growth provide secure intermediate fixation prepare bone surface site implantation . The femoral stem incorporate female taper assembly male taper femoral cup . The device undergone extensive pre-clinical testing . There clinical experience HRS .</detailed_description>
