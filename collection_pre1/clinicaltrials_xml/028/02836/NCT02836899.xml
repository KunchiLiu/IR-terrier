Methods enrollment , include procedure patient registration Patients screen `` Cardiac surgery pre-operative clinic '' , Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) Cox building floor 6 ( surgery ) . If patient eligible obtain consent primary cardiac surgeon , patient approach patient consent participate clinical trial . Consent obtain exclusively patient , surrogate , cardiac surgery usually schedule procedure . The obtain consent directly patient prefer , since opportunity interaction patient he/she fully awake . After consent obtain , patient randomize study group . A de-identified code assign patient register dedicated enrollment log . 2 . Procedures obtain informed consent ( include time consent process ) Patients screen `` Cardiac surgery pre-operative clinic '' , MGH Cox building floor 6 ( surgery ) . If patient eligible study obtain consent primary cardiac surgeon , patient approach consent participate clinical trial . There need surrogate consent trial , explain . Signing Informed Consent Form request participation study . Personal Medical Information ( PMI ) access investigator ( ) study purpose . Patients choose participate study receive standard care accord procedure ICU , without repercussion . 3 . Treatment assignment randomization ( applicable ) To ensure robust unbiased approach , randomization account demographic characteristic patient ( i.e . : age , sex ) glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Only patient care experienced anesthesiologist cardiac surgeon ( 5 year staff experience ) participate study . Participating surgeon anesthesiologist allocate alternate nitric oxide ( NO ) vs. nitrogen ( N2 ) use . The patient randomize receive either NO ( study drug ) N2 ( placebo ) alone . The random allocation sequence create use computerized random generation program . The randomization block 10 patient . This procedure perform external staff person work Critical Care Laboratory Department Anesthesia . Patients randomly allocate one test gas study group ( 80 ppm NO N2 ) placebo group ( N2 ) . The intervention consist administer test gas via cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) machine CPB via inspiratory limb anesthetic ventilator circuit , thereafter via mechanical ventilator Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Test gas administration commence onset CPB last 24 hour extubation occur 24 hour . At end 24 hour , inhale NO ( iNO ) wean discontinue carefully monitor hemodynamics period 2-4 hour . Local guideline NO gas discontinuation follow . Using commercially available tank Nitric Oxide ( Airgas Inc , Radnor Township , Pennsylvania ) volumetrically-calibrated flowmeters , pure N2 ( placebo ) 800 ppm NO gas N2 mixed pure oxygen ( O2 ) air obtain desired concentration O2 , NO treatment group , final concentration 80 ppm NO . Nitric oxide , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , O2 methemoglobin ( Met-Hb ) level continuously monitor . Patients placebo ( N2 ) group receive nitrogen test gas 24 hour-period . The inspired oxygen level maintain usual level require routine post-operative care . No change usual customary standard care intraoperative postoperative treatment make study period . 4 . Blinding procedure Nitric Oxide Nitrogen delivery A double-blind study perform avoid potential patient investigator bias . The participant , analyze data assess outcome , blind group assignment . The test gas tank gas delivery system operate room ( OR ) bedside mask keep investigator clinician treat patient blind . One perfusionist OR respiratory therapist ICU unblinded prepare appropriate test gas tank NO/N2 meter . Blood Met-Hb level NO/NO2 concentration safety concern perfusionist respiratory therapist monitor regulate ( NO2 level maintain 2 ppm , Met-Hb 5 % , necessary reduce NO concentration 40 ppm less accord MGH guideline NO therapy ) . II . STUDY PROCEDURES . Study visit parameter measure ( e.g. , laboratory test , x-ray , test ) SCREENING visit : Screening `` Cardiac surgery pre-operative clinic '' , MGH Cox building floor 6 ( surgery ) . Patients screen require prolonged CPB ( &gt; 90 minute CPB , i.e. , valve replacement Â± coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) ) primary cardiac surgeon patient agree enrol patient study . Screening consists : - Review eligibility entry criterion study : inclusion/exclusion criterion review . - Review research protocol : This protected time subject ask question become familiar aspect study protocol . - The following test perform , include : - Plasma level creatinine - Plasma level methemoglobin - Reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) test endothelial function : peripheral endothelial function assess use EndoPAT2000 technology ( Itamar-Medical Ltd. , Caesarea , Israel ) . EndoPAT technology measure change peripheral artery tone ( PAT ) signal response five-minute occlusion brachial artery pressure cuff . This arterial occlusion elicit post-ischaemic NO-dependent endothelial vasodilatation cause increase PAT signal . EndoPat technology noninvasive measurement , require finger probe blood pressure cuff . It Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve . Only patient abnormally reduce endothelial function ( LnRHI &lt; 0.7 ) enrol . - Consent form : The subject ask sign consent form . Laboratory test review physician , inclusion/exclusion criterion meet , subject enrol . RANDOMIZATION . Patients randomly allocate one test gas study group ( inhaled 80 part per million ( ppm ) nitric oxide nitrogen ) placebo group ( inhaled N2 ) . The intervention consist give test gas via CPB machine CPB via anesthetic circuit , thereafter via mechanical ventilator and/or face mask/nasal prong ICU/ward . Test gas administration commence onset CPB last 24 hour . At end 24 hour , iNO wean discontinue carefully monitor hemodynamics period 2-4 hour . Local guideline iNO discontinuation adopt . Using Inovent ( Ikaria Inc , N.J. , USA ) volumetrically-calibrated flowmeters , pure nitrogen ( placebo ) 800 ppm NO gas N2 mixed pure O2 air obtain final concentration 80 ppm NO . During CPB test gas deliver extracorporeal oxygenator , CPB NO deliver inspiratory limb anesthetic ventilator circuit . NO , NO2 O2 methemoglobin level monitor unblinded observer . Patients placebo group receive nitrogen test gas 24 hour-period . When patient extubated breathe test gas via face mask nasal prong . The inspired oxygen level maintain usual level require routine post-operative care . The test gas tank OR bedside cover blinded investigator clinician treat patient . Only perfusionist person change tank monitor respiratory level NO/NO2 methemoglobin know treatment group patient . No change usual customary standard care intraoperative postoperative treatment make study period . III . MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 1 . Independent monitoring source data . Informed consent form , case report form , data review principal investigator follow enrollment every 5 subject independent data safety monitor follow enrollment every 50 subject protocol ensure safety study subject . The safety data review include : patient- , nurse- , research-assistant , investigator-reported adverse event reason early termination protocol , adverse reaction NO . Other data review include appropriate handle processing blood sample maintenance patient confidentiality throughout study . 2 . Safety monitoring ( e.g. , Data Safety Monitoring Board , etc. ) . An interim analysis Data Safety management Board ( DSMB ) comprise 3 member plan reach 50 % study population ( 125 patient enrol ) . The study stop interim analysis detects significant increase mortality , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , need renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , post-operative hemorrhage , significant morbidity NO test gas group . Members Data Safety Management Board ( DSMB ) consist anesthesiologist clinical expertise NO , cardiac surgeon nephrologist . 3 . Outcomes monitor .

Adverse event reporting guideline The principal investigator review adverse event immediately follow occurrence report Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) accordance Partners Investigator guideline . Specifically , study , serious adverse event report phone , fax , email within 24 hour Human Research Committee ( HRC ) , follow full write report within 10 business/14 calendar day . Mild moderate adverse event present progress report continue review . Stopping rule . The review decision regard alter stop protocol perform principal investigator together DSMB . Mild moderate adverse event present progress report continue review . Protocol exit criterion : 1 . Acute worsen hypotension : decrease mean blood pressure &gt; 20 mmHg attributable cause , i.e. , hypovolemia , hemorrhage , sepsis , acute heart failure . 2 . Sudden worsen hypoxemia : decrease peripheral oxygen saturation ( SatO2 ) &lt; 70 % 100 % inspiratory oxygen fraction ( FiO2 ) attributable cause , i.e. , pulmonary edema , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , pulmonary embolism . 3 . An increase NO2 level &gt; 5 ppm baseline Or life-threatening symptom potentially attribute NO administration physician investigator . IV . BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS 1 . Specific data variable collect study Preoperative collection patient data MGH electronic medical chart ( EPIC ) include : - Patient demographic - Past current medical surgery history therapy - Co-morbidities - Pertinent cardiopulmonary test result : i.e. , echocardiography , cardiac catheterization , pulmonary function test , chest image ) . Prospective collection patient data include : - ICU length hospital stay - Duration mechanical ventilation - Hospital course - Mortality - Activity daily live 28 90 day surgery - Nonfatal stroke , define National Institute Health ( NIH ) Stroke Scale baseline surgery 28 90 day surgery - Perioperative non-perioperative nonfatal myocardial infarction , define third universal definition MI release 2012 European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) /American College Cardiology Foundation ( ACCF ) /American Heart Association ( AHA ) /World Heart Federation ( WHF ) - Prolonged ventilation define patient remain ventilator 48 hour surgery - Renal failure require dialysis time within first 90 day surgery - Acute renal injury , define accord Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss kidney function , End-stage kidney disease ( RIFLE ) /Acute Kidney Injury Network ( AKIN ) criterion . Samples collect : - Arterial blood gas ( ABG ) measure Methemoglobin gas exchange baseline , end CPB , ICU admission , 24 hour . These ABGs routinely obtain clinical purpose operate room intensive care unit . Additional ABGs take , already obtain . - Blood sample collect surgery , end surgery , day day 7 cardiac procedure hospital discharge day 7 . The sample test : creatinine urinary biomarkers . Urine sample collect blood sample obtain , i.e. , hemorrhagic shock . - Total daily urine output record calculate GFR . 2 . Statistical method The primary aim study determine whether supplementation NO decrease incidence AKI patient endothelial dysfunction . A total 250 cardiac-surgery patient enrol , require 90 minute CPB . The two arm compare homogeneity baseline characteristic ( age , weight , sex , GFR ) , intraoperative course ( cardiac-surgeon/anesthesiologist , CPB time , amount blood transfusion ) postoperative data ( post-operative transfusion , adverse event directly relate surgery procedure ) . To examine difference two group , use unpaired Student 's t-test continuous variable normal distribution , Mann-Whitney U test continuous variable normally distribute Fisher 's exact test dichotomous variable . Continuous variable describe meanÂ±standard deviation ( SD ) normally distribute , median interquartiles ( IQR ) normally distribute , count ( % ) dichotomous variable . The change laboratory marker time two group test repeated measure ANOVA . The incidence AKI postoperative adverse event prolong CPB describe term relative risk significance level confidence interval two group . Based occurrence miss data , strategy manage decide . However , aim would use kind imputation . 3 . Power analysis The sample size trial calculate base primary endpoint : reduction AKI incidence . Despite track incidence , AKI common MGH patient open-heart surgery , reasonable assume AKI incidence similar recent report US European study major academic center CPB ( AKI incidence report 50 60 % ) . In prior trial NO cardiac surgery , sample size calculate find 30 % reduction incidence AKI ( n=212 trial ) . We estimate great ( 35 % ) reduction incidence AKI anticipate population endothelial dysfunction affect beneficial therapeutic property NO . Thus , NO group incidence AKI expect decrease 55 % 35.75 % . The sample size need detect difference , assume alpha error 0.05 ( two-sided test ) study power 0.8 , 114 patient per group . In order account possible dropout , increase sample size 10 % . We enroll 250 patient , 125 NO group 125 patient control ( N2 ) group .</detailed_description>
