	<brief_summary>Abstract : Empowerment intervention chronic disease evolve process . No agreement exist regard necessary component methodology apply . Systematic review assess effect self-management intervention . Improvements illness belief , adherence drug therapy glucose monitoring report . In long term , major change achieve weight , physical activity , smoking status , depression score . There need additional study . The Center Comprehensive Care Patients Diabetes ( CAIPaDi ) program intervention design provide education empowerment technique ( use simple low-cost interactive tool ) short period time follow at-distance support use internet cell phone technology . The target population consist patient type 2 diabetes , free chronic complication non-smokers . The intervention compose four monthly visit follow continuous at-distance support system . At visit , patient stay six hour center . Information present group session . Empowerment technique apply individual exchange team facilitate group session . In summary , empowerment program unmet need many healthcare service .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Integrated Attention Model Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : There major deficiency attention quality provide people diabetes Mexico . The percentage compliance therapeutic objective noticeably low one inform developed country . It require structured management strategy , adapt trait population , allow improve attention quality medium term . The National Institute Medical Sciences Nutrition Salvador Zubirán ( INCMNSZ ) develop integrated management program use best evidence available . The target population people type 2 diabetes , less 5 year diagnosis , free chronic complication . Selection criterion allow intervention benefit diminish incidence chronic complication . 2 . Hypothesis : `` The management strategy apply Center Comprehensive Care Patient Diabetes ( CAIPaDi ) allow achieve international treatment standard ( propose NCQA ) two-year period '' . 3 . General Specific objectives : General objective : To quantify result one year start integrated management program orient self-care activity apply CAIPaDi . Specific objective : - To measure program impact ( 4 month , one two year ) base follow variable : self-care ( measure standardize questionnaire ) , efficacy parameter ( HbA1c , fast glycemia , blood lipid , arterial pressure use anti-platelet aggregate ) , execution parameter ( compliance evaluation preventive measure search microalbuminuria , ophthalmologic check , influenza vaccination , among others ) , incidence micro- macrovascular complication diabetes , hospitalization , use emergency service unforeseen expense relate diabetes . - To compare efficacy execution parameter case attend center , patient similar characteristic attend `` Internal Medicine '' service INCMNSZ . - To carry study social-economic impact intervention . 4 . Goals : It intend validate intervention provide integrated attention people diabetes , order generate patient his/her family , competency require self-care long term prevention chronic characteristic . Intervention low-cost . This characteristic , along intervention systematization allow model exportable first-contact unit . 5 . Scientific Methodology : CAIPaDi mission improve quality life patient diabetes mean intervention adapt needs patient , apply step-by-step action program '' . Intervention consist four monthly visit , one 6 hour long . The visit individual group session . The nine specialist multidisciplinary team endocrinologist , diabetes educator , nutritionist , psychologist , dentist , psychiatrist , specialist physical activity , ophthalmologist foot care . Some function may fulfil health professional , previously train . At session , standardized action apply , assessed preset indicator . At initial yearly visit follow laboratory test take : glycated hemoglobin , blood chemistry , lipid profile , liver function test , albumin-creatinine index isolate urine sample , 12-deviation electrocardiogram . At yearly visit patient receive reinforcement treatment modification need . Contact keep patient via phone call , e-mails message mobile phone . Patients ask send assessment preset date . Materials tool develop , allow measure information study real time , empowerment patient decision-making multi-disciplinary team , base clinical practice guideline . There information 1200 patient 2-year follow-up . Besides information 1200 additional case follow-up one year , 1200 others assessments 6 month . Therefore , population assess execution variable shall 3600 participant . Such sample size allow u detect difference high 5 % percentage case comply therapeutic objective compare initial assessment . As secondary analysis , result compare population receive attention `` Internal Medicine '' service INCMNSZ ( n=300 subject ) . Patients refer clinic first contact physician outside Institute . 6 . Expected impact medium long term : This proposal allow validate intervention design applied CAIPaDi . In case demonstrate usefulness cost-effectiveness , intervention export first-contact unit . Manuals tool develop allow implementation program minimum resource . Such action allow create network health unit operate quality standard INCMNSZ . 7 . Infrastructure available participate institution : The INCMNSZ area center operate . 8 . Deliverable result : Procedure manual action include intervention , tools decision making base clinical practice guideline patent , educational material design empower patient ( patentable product ) , internet portal , electronic file , database , article high impact magazine , diploma course generate specific competency relate diabetes treatment center management .</detailed_description>
