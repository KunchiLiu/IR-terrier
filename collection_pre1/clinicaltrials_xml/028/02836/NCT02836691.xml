	<brief_summary>The autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) play important role asthma , primarily parasympathetic ( cholinergic pathway ) promote bronchoconstriction . Asthma chronic inflammatory disease , however , bronchoconstriction always cause bronchial inflammation , occur paucigranulocitic phenotype noninflammatory asthma . The hypothesis project base activation parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) would involve pathogenesis noninflammatory asthma ( paucigranulocitic phenotype ) emotional stress poor control patient severe asthma . To determine ANS involvement pathogenesis paucigranulocItic phenotype asthma correlate emotional stress , mediate ANS , uncontrolled severe asthma . 30 asthmatic different clinical severity ( mild , severe control uncontrolled severe ) recruit , along control group 10 healthy people . Descriptive variable , spirometry , inflammatory parameter ( FeNO inflammatory cell count induce sputum ) , blood , saliva , urine hair obtain stress marker ( glucose , copeptin , prolactin , cortisol ) collect , supply validated questionnaire asthma control , quality life stress . For monitor response ANS do electrocardiogram , record heart rate variability ( HRV ) . This analysis carry collaboration engineer specialize characterization cardiovascular signal measure ANS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Role ANS asthma For decade 's consider autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) play important role pathophysiology symptomatology asthma . The ANS important function besides regulate airway , bronchial smooth muscle tone , secretion , blood flow , microvascular permeability , also act migration release inflammatory mediator . This complex interaction inflammation neuronal control airway , effect inflammatory mediator neurotransmitter , modulates inflammatory response ( hypersecretion , edema release pro-inflammatory mediator mast cell ) , activation cholinergic reflex . Cholinergic neuronal pathway dominant effect bronchoconstriction , therefore represent excellent therapeutic target . Anticholinergics reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness wide range bronchoconstriction agent , prostanoids , histamine , bradykinin , capsaicin , exercise allergen . 2 . ANS non-inflammatory asthma ( paucigranulocitic ) In asthma distinguish different inflammatory phenotype , commonly typify presence eosinophil 's neutrophil , perform non invasive technique inflammometric exhale nitric oxide induced sputum . But 's always bronchoconstriction mediate bronchial inflammation . There significant proportion patient asthma , 40 % objective bronchial inflammation , asthma call noninflammatory asthma paucigranulocitic phenotype , proceed normal level eosinophil 's neutrophils sputum . The pathogenesis phenotype well define , although suspect cause strictly mechanical mechanism diameter airway induce nervous stimulation . Among mechanism , PNS could play important role , however study evaluate activation PNS different clinical inflammatory disease phenotype . 3 . Control asthma stress Emotional stress affect appearance development asthma act directly pathogenic mechanism airway , since state great psychological stress associate impaired adrenal sympathetic system adrenal-pituitary-hypothalamic axis ( APH ) . The argument psychological stress influence autonomic control airway base primarily fact many autonomous mechanism seem play role asthma involved activation regulation physiological response stress chronic stress alter APH axis , cortisol secretion attenuate , lead increase secretion inflammatory cytokine . 4 . Non-Invasive method measure role ANS Some author 's suggest alter autonomic control caliber airway asthma reflect parallel change heart rate ( HR ) , show asthmatic population likely elevate rest heart rate compare asthmatic population . Asthma allergy associate increased activity PNS asthma cause elevation heart rate variability ( HRV ) , base measurement basal parasympathetic tone . In fact , author asthma severity associate great impairment HRV . Therefore , evaluation ANS great interest diagnosis , prognosis monitoring respiratory disorder . Direct evaluation PNS infeasible impractical situation . However , non-invasive evaluation PNS propose HRV accord standard measurement , physiological interpretation clinical use guide work group European Society American Cardiology Electrophysiology make electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Ultimately , research project aim evaluate comprehensive manner role play ANS pathogenesis asthma , namely uncontrolled non-inflammatory asthma severe asthma . The result study could provide new clue understand mechanism asthma pas inflammatory . And therefore identification characterization role ANS disease could generate preliminary evidence lay research aim develop new molecule anticholinergic capacity treat asthma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients sex age 16 diagnose asthma ( accord criterion GEMA 4.0 ) . The diagnosis asthma assume patient record state suggestive previous symptom asthma variable airflow obstruction ( determined spirometry meter peak flow ) positive bronchodilator test ( increase 12 % 200 ml . FEV1 inhalation bronchodilator ) positive test unspecific bronchoconstriction . Asthma exacerbation month visit Concomitance chronic respiratory disease ( bronchiectasis , fibrosis , etc . ) Other important comorbidities opinion investigator example : cardiovascular , endocrinological ( especially diabetes , mental retardation , psychiatric neurological disease relevant systemic inflammatory immune disease</criteria>
