	<detailed_description>The role gut hormone axis glucose control significant interest due proven translational impact diabetes management . It also significantly alter gastric surgery , procedure lead deleterious symptom ( dump syndrome ) lean , non-diabetic patient . The investigator study unique cohort young , lean patient undergo surgery prevention gastric cancer , well patient undergo surgery gastric oesophageal cancer , understand regulation pathophysiological role gut hormone axis . The prophylactic patient population recruit pool patient genetic mutation confer high lifetime risk gastric cancer ( Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer ) Addenbrooke 's Hospital provide national clinical service . The investigator aim define causative physiological pathway dump syndrome group expand body knowledge gut hormone role glucose homeostasis eat behaviour . It suspect year surgery profound physiological effect simple anatomical rearrangement , however recent development bariatric surgery bring fore . The era surgical treatment peptic ulcer disease result large cohort patient undergo gastric surgery suffer post-operative dumping symptom . These include symptom attribute hypovolaemia immediately meal , follow hypoglycaemia within hour . There significant hiatus study dump syndrome decline surgery ulcer disease 1980s . The major improvement long-term survival surgery oesophageal gastric cancer see 21st Century , couple identification high risk familial cohort undergo prophylactic gastrectomy , lead grow cohort long-term survivor gastrectomy . This present significant challenge define manage ongoing , quality life-limiting metabolic consequence gastrointestinal surgery . The late dumping symptom suffer patient cohort include paradoxical post-prandial hypoglycaemia , likely result excessive insulin response particular component ingest food . There also population patient undergo oesophagectomy malignant pre-malignant condition oesophagus , receive post-operative nutrition feed tube sit abdominal wall enter jejunum approximately 1 metre origin . This group patient suffer similar metabolic change undergo gastrectomy , provide unique opportunity study differential response nutrient administer orally distally . This could elucidate role proximal gut hormone glucose homeostasis . The recent expansion understand metabolic effect surgery largely drive study bariatric ( well term metabolic ) surgery . It well know Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) result early remission diabetes 85 % case elevate level gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , considerable debate around whether gut hormone change contribute reduction plasma glucose appetite surgery . Whereas study rodent model appear indicate gut hormone largely redundant bypass surgery , data human strongly support idea increase post-prandial GLP-1 Peptide YY ( PYY ) level underlie improvement insulin secretion reduce appetite . Studies bariatric cohort confound requirement dietary restriction surgery massive weight loss surgery . Multiple study measure baseline stimulate level circulate gut hormone RYGB obese subject . Elevated level GLP-1 PYY reduce level ghrelin report study , variable result find glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) . Fewer study address change gut hormone secretion gastrectomy lean subject . Limited study demonstrate change GLP-1 secretion . Literature experimental approach dump pathway largely limited case report small series indicate role glucose-insulin axis . The role gut microbiota determine host metabolism topical area interest , follow discovery lean obese phenotype transfer gut microbial transplantation rodent model . Despite excitement surround area , remain highly controversial research field , extent human microbiome influence energy metabolism hotly debate . A variety microbial metabolite , include short chain fatty acid indole , however , modulate gut hormone secretion , likely contribute basal gut hormone release fast state . An interesting question previously address whether gut hormone secretion become dependent microbial metabolism bypass surgery , either resident colonic bacteria supply increased load fermentable nutrient , increase bacterial growth proximal intestine ( small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ) . It , however , well establish microbial metabolism alter post-surgical patient , assess non-invasively appearance raise hydrogen methane level exhale breath . It also possible differ pool bacteria people may contribute varied metabolic phenotype - therefore important characterise microbiome ass change arise due surgery antibiotic treatment . Beyond purely physiological effect surgery , increase understanding removal stomach oesophagus profound effect person 's appetite eating behaviour . This likely result central action gut derive hormone , area significant interest obesity field . Anecdotally , post-gastrectomy patient frequently report minimal appetite significant change food preference . At present , characterise scientifically rigorous fashion . A variety tool exist assess motivation impulsivity person 's relationship food non-invasive fashion , administer home , adjunct gut hormone secretion test . Previous study investigator ' group beyond demonstrate L cell , prime enteroendocrince cell ( EECs ) secrete GLP-1 , directly sense glucose uptake receptor bile acid short chain free fatty acid ( bacterial fermentation product carbohydrates ) . Each pathway could theoretically contribute enteroendocrine detection ingest carbohydrate , relative importance different sensory mechanism , well , GI surgery unknown . Overall , propose study gut hormone secretion metabolism lean population define causative pathway dump syndrome provide model study post-operative gut hormone change without confound effect massive weight loss . In turn , expand knowledge physiological pathway underlie gut hormone secretion role glucose homeostasis , potential offer new therapeutic research target diabetes obesity care , well patient cohort .</detailed_description>
