	<brief_summary>Mepolizumab humanize monoclonal antibody . In condition eosinophilia consider play important part pathology , include eosinophilic asthma , HES , eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis , consistent reduction blood eosinophil count observe association mepolizumab administration , concomitant clinical improvement . This 32-week treatment period , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicentre study mepolizumab adolescent adult subject severe HES receive standard care ( SoC ) therapy . This study demonstrate efficacy mepolizumab compare placebo base maintenance control HES symptom treatment period . The study comprise screen period approximately 4 week follow 32-Week study treatment period ( subject randomize 1:1 placebo mepolizumab ) 8-week additional follow-up period ( 12 week last dose study treatment ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Capable give sign informed consent/assent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol Twelve year age old , time signing inform consent/assent Subjects diagnose HES least 6 month randomization A history two HES flare within past 12 month prior screen . Historical HES flare define document HESrelated worsen clinical symptom blood eosinophil count require escalation therapy . At least one HES flare within past 12 month must relate decrease HES therapy 4 week prior flare . Subjects must blood eosinophil count &gt; =1000 cells/ÂµL present sample collect screening ( within 4 week prior randomization ) . Subjects must stable dose HES therapy 4 week prior randomization . HES therapy include limited oral corticosteroid , immunosuppressive , cytotoxic therapy . Male female . A female subject eligible participate pregnant , lactating , either nonreproductive potential reproductive potential agree use highly effective method avoid pregnancy 30 day prior first dose study medication 4 month last dose study treatment . Lifethreatening HES lifethreatening HES comorbidities : Imminently lifethreatening HES disease severity likelihood death high unless course disease interrupt within 12 week prior randomization . Subjects know , preexist , clinically significant endocrine , autoimmune , metabolic , neurological , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , hematological , respiratory system abnormality associate HES uncontrolled standard treatment . Eosinophilia unknown clinical significance Twelvelead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding : QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec QTc &gt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block abnormal ECG find 12lead ECG conduct Visit 1 consider clinically significant would impact subject 's participation study base evaluation Investigator . Subjects document history clinically significant cardiac damage prior screening , opinion investigator , would impact subject 's participation study . Liver abnormality/disease Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ALT &gt; 5xULN document HES liver manifestation , bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 percent ) , current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Stable chronic liver disease generally define absence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , oesophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice , cirrhosis . NOTE : Chronic stable hepatitis B C ( e.g. , presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) positive hepatitis C antibody test result screen within 3 month prior first dose study treatment ) acceptable subject otherwise meet entry criterion . Clinical diagnosis eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis ( EGPA ) Subjects history current lymphoma , subject current malignancy previous history cancer remission le 12 month prior randomization . Subjects localize carcinoma ( i.e. , basal squamous cell ) skin resect cure exclude . FIP1 like 1platelet derived growth factor receptor ( FIP1L1PDGFR ) Status : Subjects test positive FIP1L1PDGFR fusion tyrosine kinase gene translocation . Subjects chronic ongoing active infection require systemic treatment , well subject experience clinically significant infection due virus , bacteria , fungi within 4 week prior randomization subject preexist helminthes infestation within 6 month prior randomization Subjects know human immunodeficiency virus ( e.g. , HIV ) , explain use OCS therapy take HES . Other laboratory abnormality : Evidence clinically significant abnormality hematological , biochemical urinalysis screen sample collect screening , could put subject 's safety risk participate study , judge investigator Subjects previously receive mepolizumab 4 month prior randomization Subjects receive intravenous subcutaneous corticosteroid 4week period prior randomization monoclonal antibody within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , randomization Subjects receive treatment investigational agent ( biologic nonbiologic ) within past 30 day 5 drug halflives whichever longer , prior randomization subject currently participate interventional clinical study Subjects responsive oral corticosteroid base clinical response blood eosinophil count Subjects history hypersensitivity monoclonal antibody ( include mepolizumab ) steroid steroidcontaining product Subjects know suspected history alcohol substance abuse screen opinion investigator could interfere subject 's proper completion protocol requirement .</criteria>
