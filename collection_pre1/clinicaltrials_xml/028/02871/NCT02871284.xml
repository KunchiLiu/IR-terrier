	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity ( CIPN ) side effect chemotherapy negatively affect patient ' quality life may lead treatment disturbance . CIPN frequently record patient treated alkylating platinum-based drug , antitubulins include taxanes vinca alkaloid , drug include suramin , thalidomide , lenalidomide proteasome inhibitor bortezomib , represent one severe potentially dose-limiting non-hematological toxic effect . Sufficient treatment option preventive measure lack . There evidence physical activity strategy able address exist CIPN symptom potentially increase quality life affect patient . CIPN symptoms involves restriction sensory sometimes motor modality , example , deficit plantar perception dysfunction postural control one study type II diabetes patient also suggest structured exercise might preventive potential regard peripheral neuropathy incidence . Based finding , aim investigate preventive potential sensorimotor intervention vs. machine-based resistance training vs. usual care ( wait-list control group ) randomize control three-arm intervention trial among cancer patient undergo chemotherapy high risk CIPN . On basis power calculation , goal include 82 patient per intervention arm result total patient number enrol n=246 . CIPN symptom assess objectively via comprehensive clinical electrodiagnostic examination ( Total Neuropathy Scale ; TNS-reduced ) subjectively via questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 &amp; FACT-GOG-Ntx , EORTC QLQ-C30 ) . Additionally CIPN effectiveness select intervention objectively evaluate spectral analysis Centre Pressure ( COP ) variation . Further key secondary endpoint : physical performance , sleep quality chemotherapy compliance .</brief_summary>
