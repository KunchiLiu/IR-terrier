	<brief_title>Study Obinutuzumab Lenalidomide Previously Untreated Subjects With Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive obinutuzumab vein 4-6 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2-6 Cycle 8 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 10 , 12 , 14 , ) Cycle 30 . About 30-60 minute dose obinutuzumab , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . You also take lenalidomide capsule mouth Days 1-21 Cycles 1-6 . Each dose lenalidomide take time day , either without food . After Cycle 6 , may receive additional 12 cycle lenalidomide base respond lenalidomide . The doctor discus . Lenalidomide capsule swallow whole water open , break , chew . If dose miss , take soon possible day , however take next dose accord normal dosing schedule . Do take extra `` make-up '' dose miss dose . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine testing . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-18 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan ( Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 ) . On Day 1 Cycle 20 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 22 , 24 , 26 , ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan ( Cycles 20 26 ) . If become pregnant regular menstrual cycle , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test every week Cycle 1 1 time every cycle . If become pregnant irregular menstrual cycle , test every week Cycle 1 every 2 week . Length Study : You may receive obinutuzumab 30 cycle may receive lenalidomide 18 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 2 year follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 4 week ( ±14 day ) last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine testing . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT . - If become pregnant , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test . If regular menstrual period , test within 28 day last dose study drug . If irregular menstrual cycle , test perform within 14 28 day last dose study drug . If side effect end-of-treatment visit , study doctor may call collect information medical record 30 day end-of-treatment visit check health side effect go away becomes stable . If call , call take 5 minute . Follow-Up : Every 6 month first 18 month 1 time every year 2years last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine testing . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan . This investigational study . Obinutuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment different type lymphoma multiple myeloma ( MM ) . It consider investigational combine obinutuzumab lenalidomide treat FL . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
