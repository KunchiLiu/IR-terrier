The REST program recruit 24 college veteran engage seven-week multi component sleep improvement program use evidence-based educational behavioral change support consider best practice improve sleep quality . The investigator ' scientific objective application establish efficacy group-based sleep education sleep-skills intervention improve sleep quality duration , advance understanding relationship participant ' sleep-related knowledge behavior associate improved sleep quality duration veteran service-related injury college . The investigator initially engage 8 participant establish treatment fidelity participant satisfaction 7-week group intervention . This follow engage 16 additional participant 7-week group intervention , 8 randomly place wait-list control receive intervention .

	<detailed_description>Design : The investigator complete mixed-methods prospective longitudinal study pre post intervention test ( component A ; N = 8 ) , follow mixed-methods wait-listed cross-over control trial pre post intervention test ( component B ; N = 16 ) . Within component A participant complete pre-intervention assessment , complete 7-weeks group intervention weekly monitoring , complete post-intervention assessment follow-up assessment 3 month later . Within component B , 8 participant randomly assign early intervention group 8 participant assign wait-listed cross-over ( late ) intervention group . Participants early late group complete pre-intervention assessment time . Participants early intervention group complete 7-weeks group intervention weekly monitoring , complete post-intervention assessment immediately intervention follow-up assessment 3 month later . Participants late intervention group complete sleep diary information 7 randomly-chosen night , second pre-intervention assessment approximately 8-weeks follow initial pre-intervention assessment , complete 7-weeks group intervention weekly monitoring , complete post-intervention assessment follow-up assessment 3 month later . All intervention occur within CSU Occupational Therapy Department , pre post intervention assessment complete use web-based survey . Participants : Active recruitment study participant occur email telephone contact veteran engage ongoing CSU IRB-approved study agree contact regard participation future study occur within Department Occupational Therapy New Start Student Veterans Program . Participants receive gift card choice complete post-intervention assessment , whereas participant assign late group Component B receive additional gift card complete second pre-intervention assessment . Participants complete 7- week group intervention first two post-intervention assessment also allow keep Fitbit wearable actigraph use within study . Data Collection : The investigator complete comprehensive evaluation assessment period . Data collect address 2 aim . Aim 1 assess fidelity participant satisfaction group-delivered sleep education sleep skill intervention veteran service-related injury college . The working hypothesis group-delivered sleep education sleep skill intervention safe , demonstrate adequate treatment fidelity , participant satisfaction . Aim 2 assess efficacy group-delivered sleep education sleep skill intervention veteran service-related injury college term key variable interest . The work hypothesis participation group-delivered sleep education sleep skill intervention result improvement participant ' sleep quality , sleep duration , mental health . Further , evaluation program data include participant ' attendance , sleep-related knowledge behavior , program adherence , qualitative interview data seek understand key process outcomes associate intervention efficacy . Please see Outcome Measures section protocol registration name purpose outcome . Intervention : All post 9/11 veteran participant complete 7-week group sleep education sleep skill intervention within Department Occupational Therapy . The investigator deliver sleep education sleep skill group-based intervention base upon establish best-practices improve sleep quality sleep quantity associate insomnia , specifically targeted student veteran service-related injury . All component intervention deliver register licensed occupational therapist practice within New Start Student Veterans Program Department Occupational Therapy , serve college veteran service-related injury CSU Front Range Community College . For duration study two local physician , board certify Sleep Medicine Psychiatry respectively available consultation sleep issue relate veteran . The 7-week group intervention develop improve sleep quality sleep quantity sleep-related education behavioral goal set addressing : sleep monitoring actigraph sleep log , sleep education , sleep hygiene development maintenance good sleep habit , stimulus control sleep preparation , mindfulness/ yoga sleep preparation daily stress reduction . Participants also meet individually either person telephone weekly basis register licensed occupational therapist , experience work student veteran service-related injury , knowledgeable sleep-related education use within intervention . Individualized meeting use assure : 1 ) understand adherence use sleep monitoring actigraphy sleep diary , 2 ) establish monitor participant ' individualize goal relate sleep skill behavior . Participants also access occupational therapist CSU 's Assistive Technology Resource Center , experience work veteran service-related injury , support use Fitbit sleep actigraph associate mobile sleep application ensure understand Fitbit use , integration ( sync ) Fitbit mobile application , establishment anonymous web-based profile monitor sleep-related data . Data Analysis : For Aim 1 , investigator assess intervention fidelity participant satisfaction group deliver sleep education sleep skill intervention , investigator report proportion educational content behavioral goal establish , proportion participant rate intervention enjoyable ( 1-4 Likert scale ) . Descriptive statistic use examine mean variance key construct interest . Change key variable 7-week intervention inspect via individual growth chart . Attendance , attrition , adverse event report proportion . The investigator use focus group formally evaluate program , elicit suggestion program improvement . Importantly , participant ask describe change occur intervention think sleep education behavioral sleep goal help improve sleep quality , sleep quantity sleep-related variable , mindfulness , physical , mental , social health domain . Qualitative analytic software ( e.g. , Atlas TI ) use code segment qualitative data . The investigator review text identify emergent theme use iterative consensus building process generate theme cod participant spouses/ significant others . For Aim 2 quantitative data analyze two way . First , construct measure pre post intervention , repeated-measures ANOVA conduct determine post-intervention score differ significantly across early delay condition . Second , sleep variable , collect daily basis intervention , time-series approach use examine within person change construct time . This type analysis model effect intervention meaningful outcome collect regularly time - measurement implementation intervention , intervention , ideally intervention . Using time-series model , effect intervention estimate adjust serial dependence measure shift ( e.g. , day week , length day , mid-terms/finals , outside temperature ) , specification linear model capture increase decrease mean level slope time-series . Specifically , Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average ( ARIMA ) model use examine intervention effect program identify outcome .</detailed_description>
