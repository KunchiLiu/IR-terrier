	<brief_summary>The project aim investigate marker neural activity connectivity , neurochemistry , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis activity , inflammation neuronal plasticity underlie treatment response remission ECT . These measure assess depressive patient prior , ECT also 6 month . Furthermore , investigate control group depressive patient treat antidepressant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>About 30 % patient suffer major depressive disorder ( MDD ) respond sufficiently establish pharmacological , psychotherapeutic , somatic treatment . Treatment-resistant MDD associate illness chronicity , reduce quality life , high risk suicide . For patient , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) well-established treatment strategy response rate 60 % 80 % , make potent rapidly act treatment MDD . Despite frequent widespread use ECT 70 year , exact neurobiological mechanism underlie efficacy remain unclear . In broad sense , understand therapeutic effect ECT may also shed light pathophysiological cause severe depression mechanism action effective treatment . Eventually , elucidation effect ECT could allow reproduction less invasive way benign side-effect profile , thereby result significantly enhance treatment MDD . To achieve , though , need first understand good ECT influence brain function . The propose project therefore aim investigate marker neural activity connectivity , neurochemistry , HPA axis activity , inflammation neuronal plasticity underlie treatment response remission ECT . These measure assess depressive patient prior , ECT also 6 month . Furthermore , investigate control group depressive patient treat antidepressant . This treatment-specific approach enable u disentangle behavioral , neuronal , hormonal immunological alteration crucial antidepressant response might use response prediction . More generally , project greatly broaden understanding mechanism underlie profound antidepressant effect ECT thereby shed light pathophysiological cause MDD mechanism action effective treatment .</detailed_description>
