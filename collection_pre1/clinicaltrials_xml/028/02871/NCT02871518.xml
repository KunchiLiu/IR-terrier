	<brief_title>Two Cycles Versus Three Cyclle CCRT Low Risk Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) endemic Southern China Southeast Asia . Several prospective randomize trial demonstrate concurrent chemoradiotherapy superior radiotherapy alone treatment locoregionally advance NPC . Concurrently , although cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy consider standard regimen locoregionally advance nasopharyngeal carcinoma , several prospective randomize trial demonstrate 52-63 % patient finish three cycle cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( DDP , 100mg/m2 , D1 , D22 D43 ) , due chemoradiotherapy induced toxicity . Combined analyse NPC-9901 NPC-9902 Trials indicate 5-year locoregional failure free survival insignificant patient receive two three cycle cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Our previous study also demonstrate five year overall survival , distant metastasis free survival 5-year locoregional failure free survival observe significant difference patient receive two three cycle cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy . It indicate one pressing question remain resolved : define optimal dose reduce toxicity avoid unnecessary overdose ineffective phase treatment ? Recently , quantification pretreatment plasma Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) DNA , consider potential biomarker compliment TNM stage , demonstrate useful biomarker risk stratification , monitor prediction prognosis NPC . The investigator previous study demonstrate local regionally advanced NPC patient EBV DNA &lt; 4,000copies/mL , 3-year 's PFS DMFS approximate 90 % . Pretreatment plasma EBV DNA level might apply guide concurrent chemotherapy regimen local regionally advanced NPC patient . Therefore , investigator make hypothesis low risk locoregionally advanced NPC patient receive two cycle chemotherapy may gain similar long-term survival receive three cycle chemotherapy , lead less chemotherapy induced toxicity . Therefore , phase II non-inferiority , randomise control clinical trial design assess efficacy low-risk patient , identify pretreatment plasma EBV DNA &lt; 4,000 copies/mL , receive two cycle cisplatin-based chemotherapy compare three cycle cisplatin-based chemotherapy</detailed_description>
