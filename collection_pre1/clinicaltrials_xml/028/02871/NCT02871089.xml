	<brief_summary>The purpose study use novel treatment approach , artificial pancreas , diagnosis type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) improve glucose control anticipate improvement residual C-peptide secretion . This open-label , multicentre , single-period , randomise , parallel group design study . It expect total 190 subject ( aim 96 randomised subject ) recruit within ten working day diagnosis type 1 diabetes paediatric diabetes centre UK . Half participant age 10 17.9 year treat conventional insulin injection half artificial pancreas ( closed loop insulin delivery system ) . Each treatment last 24 month . Subjects intervention group receive additional training component artificial pancreas , i.e . insulin pump continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) , prior start close loop insulin delivery . Subjects control intervention group continue standard therapy , i.e . multiple daily injection therapy . The study include 14 visit 1 telephone/email contact subject complete study . After run-in randomisation , visit conduct every 3 month arm . Beta-cell function assess serial measurement C-peptide response standardise mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) . MMTTs conduct baseline , 6-,12- 24 month post diagnosis . The primary outcome group difference area stimulate C-peptide curve ( AUC ) MMTT 12 month post diagnosis . Secondary outcome include group difference stimulate C-peptide AUC 24 month , difference glycaemic control assess HbA1c , time spend glucose target range , glucose variability , hypo- hyperglycaemia record periodically apply CGM , well insulin requirement change bodyweight . Additionally , cognitive , emotional behavioural characteristic participate subject parent assess , cost utility analysis benefit close loop insulin delivery perform . Safety evaluation comprises assessment frequency severe hypoglycaemic episode , diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) number , nature severity adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study : - To determine whether continued intensive metabolic control use close loop insulin delivery ( CL ) follow diagnosis type 1 diabetes preserve C-peptide secretion marker residual beta cell function compare standard multiple daily injection ( MDI ) therapy Primary objective : - To assess residual C-peptide secretion 12 month diagnosis type 1 diabetes participant receive either CL insulin delivery standard MDI therapy Secondary Objectives : - Biochemical : - To compare effect study intervention residual C-peptide secretion 24 month follow diagnosis - To examine intensive diabetes management use CL insulin delivery affect glucose control term safety efficacy 24 month - Human Factors : To assess cognitive , emotional , behavioural characteristic participate subject family member response close loop insulin delivery clinical trial - Health economics : To perform cost utility analysis inform reimbursement decision-making Study design : - An open-label , multi-centre , randomise , single period , two-arm parallel group study internal pilot , contrast close loop MDI Sample Size : - 96 participant randomise ( 48 per group ) ; clinical site aim recruit 15 20 participant Maximum duration study subject : - 24 month Recruitment : - Recruitment take place Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , Leeds Teaching Hospital , Leeds , Alder Hey Children 's Hospital , Liverpool , Nottingham Hospital , Nottingham , Oxford Children 's Hospital , Oxford , Southampton Children 's Hospital , Southampton . Consent - Written consent/assent obtain participant and/or guardian accord Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) requirement . Screening baseline assessment : Eligible participant undergo screen evaluation include follow activity : - medical ( diabetes ) history - body weight , height blood pressure measurement - record current insulin therapy - screen baseline blood sample During baseline visit , follow assessments/ intervention carry clinical research facility : - mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) - blood sample lipid profile - centrally measure HbA1c subsequent immunological analysis - questionnaires - computerise cognitive test - initiating blind CGM assess baseline glycaemic control Run period : - Following consent/screening baseline assessment , multiple daily injection therapy continue participant . All participant receive non study relate core diabetes train per usual clinical practice period three week . - All subject provide 24 hour telephone helpline also give write instruction contact clinical team . Randomisation : - Eligible participant randomise 1:1 ratio use central randomisation software either close loop standard therapy i.e . MDI . 1 . Closed loop ( interventional arm ) Following randomisation , participant close loop group receive additional training session cover key aspect insulin pump use CGM , prior start close loop insulin delivery . Once competent use study pump CGM system , participant receive training require safe effective use close loop system . During 2-4 hour session participant operate system supervision clinical team . Competency use close loop system evaluate . Thereafter , participant expect use close loop 24 month without supervision remote monitoring . The 24 hour support helpline available case problem . 2 . Multiple daily injection ( control arm ) Participants control group receive additional training session follow randomisation include refresher carbohydrate counting skill , insulin dose adjustment . Standard therapy ( i.e . MDI ) apply 24 month . Participants allow switch insulin pump therapy clinically indicate . Follow assessment ( 3- , 6- , 9- , 12- , 15- , 18- , 21- month ) : - Follow study visit conduct 3 monthly include data downloads/recording insulin requirement , adverse event recording , blood sampling ( HbA1c ) . - Participants fit blinded CGM system end follow visit . The sensor wear home 14 day send back research team . - MMTTs perform 6 month 12 month follow visit . - Sleep assess use wristwatch device 7 day follow study visit 6 12 month post diagnosis . Concomitantly , sleep diary sleep quality questionnaire distribute . - Validated questionnaire evaluate impact technology quality life , life change , diabetes management fear hypoglycaemia complete 12 month visit . - At 12 month , participant repeat computerised cognitive test first administer baseline . - Qualitative interview conduct month 12 subset subject parent . End study assessment ( 24 month ) : - A MMTT performed . - A blood sample take measurement HbA1c , lipids immunological analysis . - Validated questionnaire evaluate impact technology quality life , life change , diabetes management fear hypoglycaemia complete . - Participants repeat computerised cognitive test first administer baseline . - Sleep assess use wristwatch device 7 day within last month trial . Concomitantly , sleep diary sleep quality questionnaire distribute . - Participants family invite attend focus group discussion . 24-hour telephone helpline : - In case technical device problem relate diabetes management hypo- hyperglycaemia , subject able contact 24-hour telephone helpline local clinical research team time . The local research team access central 24 hour advice technical issue . Procedures safety monitor trial : - Standard operating procedure monitor report adverse event ( AE ) place , include serious adverse event ( SAE ) , serious adverse device effect ( SADE ) specific adverse event severe hypoglycaemia . - Subjects ask test record blood urine ketone finger prick glucose 14.0 mmol/l , part safety assessment hyperglycaemia . - A data monitoring ethic committee ( DMEC ) inform serious adverse event unanticipated serious adverse device effect occur study review compile adverse event data periodic interval . Criteria withdrawal patient safety ground : - A subject , parent , guardian may terminate participation study time without necessarily give reason without personal disadvantage . An investigator stop participation subject consideration benefit/risk ratio . Possible reason : 1 . Serious adverse event 2 . Significant protocol violation non-compliance 3 . Failure satisfy competency assessment 4 . Decision investigator , Sponsor , termination subject 's best medical interest 5 . Pregnancy , plan pregnancy , breast feeding 6 . Allergic reaction insulin Efforts make retain subject follow final primary outcome assessment even intervention discontinue , unless investigator believe harmful subject continue trial .</detailed_description>
