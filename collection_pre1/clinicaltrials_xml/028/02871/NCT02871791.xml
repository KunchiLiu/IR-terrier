	<brief_title>Palbociclib With Everolimus + Exemestane In BC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial . The Phase I portion clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . The Phase II portion study test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination Palbociclib , Everolimus , Exemestane treatment disease . This first time combination Palbociclib , Everolimus , Exemestane give human . Palbociclib drug may stop cancer cell grow . Palbociclib block activity two closely related enzyme ( protein help chemical reaction occur body ) , call Cyclin D Kinases 4 6 ( CDK 4/6 ) . These protein part pathway , sequence step , know regulate cell growth . Laboratory test suggest Palbociclib may stop growth HR+ breast cancer . Everolimus type drug call mTORinhibitor treat breast cancer prevent cell multiply inhibit pathway , sequence step , know regulate cell reproduction . Everolimus also may stop growth cancer cell decrease blood supply cancer cell . Exemestane anti-hormone therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth block estrogen receptor stimulation . Premenopausal woman also receive injection drug call LHRH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) agonist shut ovary function . It standard care people breast cancer , specifically HR+ breast cancer , take anti-hormone therapy . The combination everolimus exemestane FDA approve treat type breast cancer . The purpose Phase I portion research study determine safe tolerable dose combination Palbociclib , Everolimus , Exemestane participants ER-positive , HER2-negative advance breast cancer . The purpose Phase II portion research study determine whether combination Palbociclib , Everolimus , Exemestane effective treatment participant ER-positive , HER2-negative advance breast cancer .</detailed_description>

Women group MUST remain GnRH agonist duration protocol treatment Status post bilateral oophorectomy , adequate healing post surgery ; Men eligible , long GnRH agonist least 6 week prior study entry . Men MUST remain GnRH agonist duration protocol treatment . Participants must measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . Prior Treatment Specifics : Participants must radiological objective evidence progression CDK4/6 inhibitor regimen metastatic setting AND relapse/progression NSAI ( define either relapsed ≤ 12 month complete adjuvant NSAI progress NSAI metastatic locally advanced breast cancer ) Participants may receive number previous endocrine/hormonal line therapy metastatic setting , long none exemestanebased last dose ≥ 14 day prior registration ; Participants may receive one prior chemotherapy line advance breast cancer long last dose ≥ 21 day prior registration ; Participants may receive prior biologic treatment investigational drug long last dose ≥ 21 day prior registration ; Participants may receive radiotherapy palliative purpose must experience &gt; grade 1 treatment related toxicity complete treatment ≥ 14 day prior registration Age ≥18 year . Age restriction applies give dose adverse event data currently available use palbociclib exemestane participant &lt; 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) For participant enrol phase IIa part study , accessible tumor lesion ( ) purpose research biopsy willingness undergo research biopsy treatment initiation time disease progression , well single research blood sample initiation therapy . Participants undergo attempted ontreatment research biopsy inadequate tissue obtain still eligible receive protocol therapy . They require undergo repeat research biopsy attempt . For participant enrol phase IIa part study , willingness provide archival tumor sample available . Participants must normal organ marrow function , define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,5x109/L platelets ≥100 x109/L total hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( may post transfusion ) total bilirubin ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ≤5 × institutional upper limit normal participant liver metastization creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional normal ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . baseline QTc &lt; 500 m fast plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL / 7.8 mmol/L The effect combination palbociclib , everolimus exemestane develop human fetus unknown . Given woman study postmenopausal eligibility criterion ( de facto pharmacologically induce ) , expect woman childbearing potential study . If , reason , woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Of note , premenopausal woman men eligible GnRH agonist least 6 week prior study entry . These participant MUST remain GnRH agonist duration protocol treatment . Such participant counsel prior study entry GnRH agonists alone may adequate contraception adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) employ duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants demonstrate intolerance 125mg Palbociclib ineligible Phase I portion . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants receive previous treatment mTOR inhibitor exemestane . Participants history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition palbociclib , everolimus exemestane . Participants know brain metastasis may enrol study radiation therapy and/or surgery complete minimum 3 month stable disease demonstrate serial evaluation CT ( contrast enhancement ) MRI . Such participant must longer require treatment corticosteroid enzyme induce antiepileptic medication CNS disease . Participants bilateral diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
