	<brief_title>Surgical Stress Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The short-term advantage minimally invasive colon resection well establish several randomize trial . A major factor development morbidity surgical stress response subsequent increase demand patient 's reserve immune competence . Although advantage term stress response laparoscopic surgery open surgery widely report , little known role robotic surgery . Robotic approach see significant growth last 5 year . Taking advantage three-dimensional visualization , improve articulation , multiple operating arm provide theoretical advantage colorectal cancer surgery . In attempt evaluate surgical stress response immune function robotic colorectal surgery comparative study design . Two surgical procedure evaluate : Robotic colorectal resection ( Experimental group ) Laparoscopic colorectal resection ( Control group ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible patient histologically confirm malignancy plan elective , segmental , curative colectomy Patients previous midline laparotomy , emergency surgery , immune depressant disease medication exclude study . Perioperative postoperative complication consider exclusion criterion .</criteria>
