	<brief_summary>The main purpose investigational research study determine safe tolerable study drug , MEDI4736 ( Durvalumab ) , patient myelofibrosis ( MF ) . The study drug belongs group drug call immune checkpoint inhibitor , show promise form cancer , melanoma lung cancer . One effect drug activate patient 's natural immune system . The purpose study examine safety tolerability study drug , study effective treating patient myelofibrosis , explore certain marker patient 's blood and/or bone marrow may affect study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab Treating Patients With Primary , Post-Polycythemia Vera , Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) therapy patient myelofibrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Changes MF symptom burden . II . Changes spleen size . III . Blood and/or bone marrow sample . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate lymphocyte subset response anti-PDL1 therapy , measure percent increase cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+CD25+PD-L1+ T-lymphocytes CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes post-treatment peripheral blood sample . II . To characterize change cytokine profile response anti-PDL1 therapy . III . To measure soluble PDL1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) post-treatment blood and/or bone marrow sample program cell death-1 ( PD1 ) /PDL1 immunohistochemistry bone marrow sample correlate treatment response . OUTLINE : Patients receive durvalumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease ( SD ) , new inter-current illness , unacceptable toxicity , may continue treatment beyond 3 course . Patients follow every 3 month two year start Day 1 .</detailed_description>
