	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION Neovascular Age - related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) common cause vision loss subject age 60 . Today US 15 million people live form AMD , approximately 1.6-1.75 million people neovascular AMD associate vision loss . Approximately 200,000 new case diagnose US annually ; worldwide , approximately 500,000 new case diagnose year . With age overall population , prevalence form AMD expect rise many 42 million 2030 , project many 8 million senior risk lose vision AMD within next 5 year . Economic analysis indicate vision impairment eye disease cost US estimate $ 68 billion annually healthcare expenditure , reduce productivity , diminish quality life , AMD least $ 30 billion dollar negative impact gross domestic product . Diabetes lead cause blindness among working-age adult United States . According recent study fund National Eye Institute , diabetic retinopathy , one common debilitate complication diabetes , increase 3.7 million new case last decade . Approximately 7.7 million Americans affected diabetic retinopathy . Even alarm , rate project climb 11 million 2030 . People diabetes also great risk cataract glaucoma . But diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) far common sight-threatening condition among people diabetes lead cause blindness adult age 20 74 year . Diabetic retinopathy enormous impact national health care spending : Twenty-one percent national medical expenditure ophthalmic complication attributable diabetes . The current standard care DR identify treat disease irreversible visual loss occur . In practice , mean accurate , early diagnosis severe Non-Proliferative DR and/or Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) need identify suitable candidate Laser Photocoagulation , vitrectomy Intra-vitreal Triamcinolone , appropriate . Because DR frequently asymptomatic , degree DR risk factor progression , annual comprehensive eye exam recommend individual diabetes . Use home - base smartphone visual acuity test apps potential diagnose monitor progression DR early stage disease monitor visual change macular degeneration . Additionally , The AREDS2-HOME study show early detection neovascular AMD result good vision outcome compare standard monitoring neovascular AMD . Identification change vision would trigger clinical attention possible intervention . It conceivable would ultimately reduce economic burden DR AMD . DigiSight 's Paxos Checkup Mobile Vision Assessment System allow subject frequently check vision rapid , quantitative reproducible way , transmit information secure organize fashion , enable physician optimize administer treatment timely manner . We design CLEAR study evaluate agreement Paxos Checkup Application standard office base visual acuity test . Because Paxos Checkup test near vision test use Lebensohn Near Card main comparator . Recognizing sensitivity widespread use distance visual acuity assessment also test Paxos Checkup Application Early Test Diabetes Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity chart exploratory endpoint select site . The ETDRS visual acuity test show multiple study accurate distance vision test use therefore gain widespread acceptance research regulatory purpose . CLEAR STUDY OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate performance Paxos Checkup visual test device compare standard in-office procedure assess near visual acuity ( VA ) metamorphopsia ( Amsler grid ) , , - Document ability patient perform Paxos Checkup test home ease use . OVERVIEW The CLEAR study prospective , single arm evaluation Paxos Checkup app test , conduct two phase common protocol . In first phase comparative performance Paxos Checkup pre-specified reference method assess near vision presence normal , AMD DR document 20 enrolled subject . Results first phase use finalize protocol estimate sample size Phase 2 . There formal statistical test Phase 1 result , data Phase 1 pool Phase 2 result . The study transition Phase 1 ( 20 enrol subject ) Phase 2 believe sufficient data collect Phase 1 plan implement Phase 2 . Phase 2 expect enroll 100 150 subject base Phase 1 result . Subjects enrol three subpopulation base eye health status : subject AMD ( approximately 50 % total ) , subject DR ( approximately 30 % total ) , subject normal eye health ( approximately 20 % total ) . In Phase 2 hypothesis associate two primary endpoint study statistically test pre-specified performance goal . These performance goal base test-retest correlation finding reference test method study population . Primary Endpoint 1 : Near Corrected Visual Acuity ( NCVA ) assess Paxos Checkup compare reference method NCVA ( Lebensohn Near Card ) replicate measurement two in-office visit . At office visit , two Paxos Checkup two reference NCVA assessment make ( 4 assessment ) . The Paxos Checkup reference method test administer alternate manner enrol subject , choice first test randomly choose , least 10 minute individual test . Test result Paxos Checkup Lebensohn assessment express LogMAR unit purpose analysis . Primary Endpoint 2 : The evaluation Primary Endpoint 2 similar Primary Endpoint 1 . The Amsler Grid assessment AMD ( outcome : Normal / Abnormal ) Paxos Checkup compare reference method Amsler Grid replicate measurement two in-office visit . At office visit , two Paxos Checkup two reference Amsler Grid assessment make ( 4 assessment ) . The Paxos Checkup reference method test administer alternate manner enrol subject , choice first test randomly choose , least 10 minute individual test . The Amsler Grid evaluation do parallel CNVA ( , CNVA evaluation ) purpose time efficiency . All subject , coordinator , Primary Investigators sponsor mask aggregate result . The test sequence predetermine app visual acuity follow Amsler grid . Standard office test follow sequence . The first test subject sequence test randomize either mobile app standard method .</detailed_description>
