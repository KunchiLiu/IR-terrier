	<brief_summary>The purpose piece research assess effect altitude clinical evolution ARDS . For purpose , patient live receive care sea level compare live receive care high altitude . For reason convenience , cut-point 1500 meter sea level chosen . In addition , seek ass whether adjust cut-points severity category ARDS improve ability predict adverse event , comparison unadjusted cut-points . The result research probably disruptive , provide first information yet effect altitude ARDS ; therefore great interest international scientific community direct care patient . A high bibliometric impact expect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Physiological adaptation generate live high altitude modify clinical evolution ARDS . OBJECTIVE To describe main clinical developmental characteristic ARDS diagnose altitude great 1500 meter sea level . To compare main clinical developmental characteristic ARDS diagnose altitude great 1500 meter sea level case diagnose altitude 1500 meter sea level . METHODOLOGY Main event : Incidence ARDS Mortality ARDS Duration mechanical ventilation length ICU stay patient ARDS Sequelae find 1 year 3 year diagnosis ARDS Secondary event Recognition ARDS clinician Modes mechanical ventilation Use adjuvant therapy Design : observational , prospective , cohort , multicenter , international study Recruitment period : July 18 , 2.016 - August 18 , 2.016 General Procedure The general organization chart study implies participation 3 lead researcher , least 1 researcher/coordinator per country , main researcher service . For selection participating service , general invitation send South American ICUs locate altitude great 1500 meter sea level , well representative group ICUs locate 1500 meter sea level . The 2 cohort ( altitude sea level ) generate afterwards ; size cohort determine convenience . For selection participate service , exploratory form ( appendix 1 ) sent beforehand , order gain knowledge characteristic possibility ; center meet criterion , enrol rest document ( research protocol , appendix 2 3 ) sent . Once participate service define , coordination videoconferences hold initiation study ; e-mail address set general coordination . All question answer less 24 hour . The data collect Excel spreadsheet send coordinator country , distribute main researcher participate center . The information afterwards submit general coordinator via reverse pathway . All information send e-mail ; order maintain confidentiality , spreadsheet encrypt . The opening code know researcher responsible service , country , lead researcher study . The data include main researcher center , supervision coordinator country . Day 1 day admission ICU unadjusted Pa02/Fi02 le 300 , regardless day patient admit hospital ICU . The protocol implies gather basic data ( appendix 3 ) , obtain patient meet criterion Pa02/Fi02 less 300 . Gathering data end 28 day day 1 ( IT MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO DAY 28 AFTER ADMISSION TO ICU ) ; afterwards , data date extubation , discharge ICU hospital , condition upon discharge hospital gather . Clinical analytic data gather admission , afterwards hour morning , patient continue invasive mechanical ventilation . Diagnosis ARDS make two procedure : ( A ) automatic , consist individually pick variable pertain definition , afterwards , way computer algorithm , define whether patient complies Berlin definition ; ( B ) clinical , attend physician ask daily , since moment PaO2/Fi02 &lt; 300 , reason hypoxemia . Both diagnosis independent double-blinded . The ratio concordance calculate afterwards . Operational definition : ARDS : Berlin definition . Days free mechanical ventilation number day invasive mechanical ventilation require , disconnection day 28 . If patient dy , 0 day free mechanical ventilation consider . Driving pressure plateau pressure minus PEEP . Incidence number patient diagnose ARDS divide number patient require invasive mechanical ventilation study period . Number patient ARDS per bed service number patient diagnose ARDS divide number bed suitable mechanical ventilation available study period . Long-term follow-up ( 1 3 year ) carry central coordination team via e-mail , occasionally , telephone . Finally , single database generate , final report do . All patient incomplete data exclude analysis . Statistical analysis : In order fulfill objective 1 , descriptive epidemiological analysis primary secondary event gather patient diagnosed ARDS accord Berlin definition . In order fulfill objective 2 , comparison make proportion primary secondary event altitude cohort sea-level cohort . Categorical variable present number case percentage , continuous variable present median percentile 25-75 . Categorical variable compare chi-2 continuous variable compare Mann-Whitney Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test . In order fulfill objective 3 , ROC curve make event , take consideration unadjusted altitude-adjusted Berlin definition dependent variable . The final data report do follow recommendation Strengthening Reporting Observational Studies Epidemiology ( STROBE ) statement guideline observational cohort study . The whole statistical analysis make free R program ( http : //www.R-project.org ) . All P value two-tail P value , consider &lt; 0.05 level signification . ACCESSIBILITY OF DATA The data accessible researcher upon write request Latin American Network High-Altitude Intensive Care Medicine ( RELAMI ) . The request must write Spanish include : justification use data commitment use data exclusively scientific purpose ( explicitly state use economic purpose ) commitment publish data pubmed indexed journal within one-year period proof experience background field clinical research adhesion code ethic RELAMI analyze request decide within 60-day period receipt request . If response positive , data send anonymized ; negative , reason explain . ECONOMIC ASPECTS This study sponsor . No researcher receive economic compensation type reward participate . ETHICAL ASPECTS This study carry accordance ethical principle establish International Conference Harmonization , guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , stem Helsinki Declaration applicable regulation norm . This study consider insignificant low risk , since observational , non-interventional study , data gather without identification . Each participate ICU process pertain institutional approval , include renunciation ethical revision . Recorded dispensation participant gather clinical data without identification seek part routine clinical care . DATA MANAGEMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS The lead researcher Coordination Center act guardian data . Reports progress final report present opportunely national international conference , give priority presentation annual conference Latin America . The result study publish indexed scientific journal , preferably first decile . Only aggregate disidentified data publicly present .</detailed_description>
