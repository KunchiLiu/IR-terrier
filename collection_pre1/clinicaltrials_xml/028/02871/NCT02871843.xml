	<brief_summary>This two-part Phase I add-on clinical trial newly diagnose glioblastoma GBM . By `` add-on '' meant experimental intravenous therapy , RRx-001 , combine `` added '' standard care . In newly diagnose GBM standard care consist radiotherapy + temozolomide ( TMZ ) 6 week follow ( 4-6 week break ) maintenance TMZ give tumor progress worsens . By `` maintenance '' therapy mean TMZ give less frequently prolong extend time tumor remain stable . G-FORCE-1 conduct two part ; first part study ( Dose Escalation , Part A ) patient enter assign sequentially ( consecutively ) gradually escalate increase dos RRx-001 patient enter previous dose time longer tolerate . At dose level , separate cohort small group least 3 evaluable patient treat . RRx-001 administer intravenous infusion ( word , slow injection vein ) 30-45 minute weekly radiotherapy 6 week follow FDA-approved chemotherapy , temozolomide ( TMZ ) alone 6 month longer . In second part study ( Part B ) , new group cohorts patient receive RRx-001 dose establish Part A intravenous infusion 30-45 minute weekly radiotherapy 6 week . Then , 4-6 week break , cohort receive increase dos RRx-001 temozolomide ( word , double dose escalation ) establish acceptable safety activity window , word , dose range relatively free toxicity well active tumor , although primary purpose study assess evaluate safety . The reason rationale `` add '' RRx-001 radiotherapy TMZ , describe detail page , follow : RRx-001 radiosensitizer chemosensitizer , mean experimentally increase activity radiation chemotherapy tumor . In addition , ongoing clinical trial , patient experience minimal toxicity side effect RRx-001 alone also combination radiation brain ; therefore , hope RRx-001 synergize combine well radiotherapy TMZ GBM without add toxicity</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma multiforme also know fear three letter acronym abbreviation , GBM , common , aggressive deadly type brain tumor , standardly treat combination radiation temozolomide ( TMZ ) , FDA approve chemotherapy agent , follow temozolomide alone . One reason glioblastoma aggressive deadly poor blood flow : turn GBM multiple inefficient leaky blood vessel , lead ineffective irregular delivery nutrient oxygen tumor . As illogical may sound first , deprive cancer cell oxygen vital nutrient need grow actually make ( less might expect ) aggressive harder treat . Here 's : radiation effect tumor oxygen require since combination oxygen radiation produce unstable highly reactive free radical ; microscopic free radical equivalent spray bullet , ricochet bounce around violently inside tumor produce catastrophic damage . Likewise , chemotherapy TMZ work reach tumor blood vessel abnormal blood practically cease flow TMZ , example , may either never actually get may arrive small quantity ineffective . The expression `` survival fit '' also apply : poorly oxygenate harsh condition , result sluggish blood flow toughest resistant cancer cell survive , make tumor much hard eliminate traditional therapy . Think blood flow tumor swamp marsh rotten water seeps pool rather flows hardy organisms compete scarce resource low oxygen , partly explain GBM tumor type particular often hard treat . This clinical trial , call G-FORCE-1 , test safety , tolerability activity RRx-001 , experimental anticancer agent , standard radiation temozolomide follow temozolomide + RRx-001 newly diagnose GBM . Evidence animal human patient brain metastasis , cancer cell , metastasize spread brain different location body , show RRx-001 , many anticancer mechanism generally well tolerate alone combination radiation clinical trial , increase blood flow tumor . The increased blood flow three possible beneficial consequence : 1 ) oxygen deliver tumor , potential increase activity radiation 2 ) TMZ make tumor , potential increase activity TMZ 3 ) condition tumor gradually improve intolerable barely tolerable acceptable , treatment sensitive cancer cell may start reappear . RRx-001 also think work stimulate immune system attack tumor ; tumor biopsy sample patient RRx-001 trial demonstrate infiltration penetration particular kind white cell call T-cells . As fourth potentially beneficial consequence increase blood flow RRx-001 , immune T-cells may better access tumor , may , turn , increase kill cancer cell . G-FORCE-1 Phase 1 trial , mean main endpoint test safety tolerability RRx-001 combination radiation temozolomide activity ; however patient follow response treatment overall survival</detailed_description>
