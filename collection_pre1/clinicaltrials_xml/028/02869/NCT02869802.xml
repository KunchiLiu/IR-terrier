	<brief_summary>Researchers look good way understand treat pancreatic cancer . The purpose study see useful look change characteristic gene ( molecule contain instruction development function cell ) gene within tumour . These characteristic may useful choose treatment patient future . Changes ( mutation ) gene show important characteristic cancer . Looking difference gene patient advance pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma compare information response initial chemotherapy treatment may help learn treatment may better certain patient initial treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective non-randomized study patient metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) undergo first-line systemic chemotherapy either FOLFIRINOX GP-based regimen , tumour sample , baseline serial blood urine sample standardize clinical radiological assessment obtain . Patients plan treatment investigational agent ( ) within clinical trial use either FOLFIRINOX GP chemotherapy backbone also eligible , long eligibility criterion study meet . A total 120 patient recruit 3 year . Patients undergo fresh tumour biopsy study enrolment comprehensive molecular characterization ( biopsy cohort ) . Patients unable undergo biopsy fulfill eligibility criterion comprise archival cohort , limited genomic analysis perform archival tumour sample . Patients radiological diagnosis metastatic PDAC without confirmatory histological diagnosis may eligible ; case , tumour biopsy establish pathological diagnosis give first priority . Remaining tumour sample use research purpose diagnosis PDAC establish . In rare event ( &lt; 5 % ) histological diagnosis PDAC , patient censor study tumour material store future clinical use outside study . All patient undergo serial collection plasma , serum urine sample baseline every 4 week radiological disease progression confirm use RECIST 1.1 . These used exploratory biomarker analyse . Serum CA19-9 also measure baseline every 4 week thereafter part routine standard care disease progression confirm . In addition , whole blood sample collect baseline study germline DNA variant . CT chest , abdomen pelvis perform baseline every 8 week , radiological response therapy assess use RECIST 1.1 . Patients biopsy cohort must least one tumour lesion amenable biopsy minimum 3 tumour core safely obtainable CT ultrasound guidance , assessed staff interventional radiologist . A maximum 5 tumour core take patient baseline prior treatment FOLFIRINOX GP . At time radiological disease progression , optional second tumour biopsy collect study change molecular characteristic tumour selection pressure first-line systemic therapy . This tumour biopsy perform use exactly procedure describe baseline biopsy . Tumour biopsy molecular analysis perform Personalized Oncogenomics ( POG ) program BC ( British Columbia ) pipeline . Depending amount tumour material obtain patient , molecular analysis prioritize describe . The primary endpoint PanGen generation molecular phenotypic signature individual tumour clinically relevant timeframe . The signature data correlate clinical outcome . One key strength cohort approach rigorous annotation PDAC patient ' clinical feature outcomes treatment ( first-line ) link molecular profile . The investigator potential nimble data generate , hypothesis explore others fine-tuned eliminate .</detailed_description>
