	<brief_summary>Current treatment Veterans PTSD include medication therapy patient talk traumatic event order desensitize . While treatment work many , large minority Veterans want medication exposure therapy . The investigator develop acupuncture ( ACU ) treatment PTSD order broaden treatment option . The investigator ' first study show helped people . However , investigator need good scientific evidence work compare ACU placebo , `` sham '' acupuncture ( few needle non-important site ) determine ACU alters abnormal physiology PTSD . In study 90 Veterans randomly assign ( like coin flip ) receive either ACU sham . The investigator expect find ACU treated patient improvement PTSD physiology ( less startle reaction - assess non-invasively use skin sensor ) patient sham group . This study provide information support use acupuncture PTSD VA , expand treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) debilitate common ( 30 % Vietnam Veterans 16 % Afghanistan Iraq Veterans ) . A significant number Veterans engage drop-out effective trauma-focused therapy due avoidance trauma-related memory . Because limitation , scientific literature suggest acupuncture might effective PTSD symptom , investigator develop acupuncture intervention PTSD conduct clinical trial show positive effect . This remain high quality trial acupuncture PTSD publish , current VA/DoD guideline PTSD state acupuncture `` B '' recommendation ( fair evidence , provide service ) PTSD treatment . That civilian study compare acupuncture effective therapy ( CBT ) wait-list control , placebo control . And , research show Veterans may respond differently therapy civilian . More definitive data efficacy acupuncture PTSD require order recommend `` A '' evidence-based intervention PTSD Veterans . Specifically , important show acupuncture well placebo control effect biological abnormality PTSD . The aim study demonstrate efficacy acupuncture PTSD show clinical biological effect statistically large clinically important effect `` sham '' acupuncture . Given current knowledge need efficient , ethical best practice within experimental design , primary aim best accomplish randomize control trial compare verum acupuncture ( ACU ) placebo minimal needle sham acupuncture ( MIN ) . The goal evaluate ACU significant positive signal , compare ACU intervention evaluate treatment durability . Acupuncture deliver 24 session 12 week . The primary hypothesis efficacy ACU PTSD symptom severity large ( pre- post-treatment Cohen 's &gt; 0.8 ) , significantly good MIN ( group Cohen 's &gt; 0.30 , 80 % probability detect true group difference p &lt; 0.05 ( 2-sided ) . The secondary hypothesis compare MIN , ACU associate significantly large change pre- post-treatment psychophysiological response ( decreased startle EMG eyeblink fear conditioning procedure ) . The study design two-arm , parallel-group , prospective randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The sample frame Veterans chronic PTSD sample convenience seek care Long Beach VA. Exclusion criterion mean keep individual characteristic know PTSD treatment confounds , associate non-adherence negative response treatment , may significantly affect biological assessment , may put risk harm . The sample size ( 90 ) provide adequate power test hypothesis . Subjects allocate intervention group computer-generated adaptive randomization . General linear mixed model use evaluate hypothesize effect time ( mid treatment , end treatment , 1-month follow-up ) , control baseline severity symptom demographic characteristic ( e.g. , age , gender ) use intent-to-treat modeling . Outcome effect size ( Cohen 's ) within subject calculate . Interaction term include model evaluate treatment fidelity treatment expectancy potential moderator . Study result provide clinicians policy maker information make decision rational use acupuncture PTSD . This important acupuncture tout PTSD many advocate . It potential reach PTSD sufferer willing engage trauma-focused psychotherapy , current therapy ineffective . The objective project consistent priority research area specific interest Clinical Science Research &amp; Development ( CSR &amp; D ) include PTSD complementary medicine , participant Veterans VA Hospital .</detailed_description>
