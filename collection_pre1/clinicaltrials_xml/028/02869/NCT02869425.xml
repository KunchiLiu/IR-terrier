	<brief_title>To Assess Effects Arbaclofen ER Tablets Compared With Placebo Sperm Parameters Male Subjects With MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary safety objective ass effect arbaclofen ER tablet ( AERT ) compare placebo sperm concentration baseline end 90 day treatment male subject MS . Secondary Objectives : The secondary safety objective ass : - The effect AERT compare placebo follow sperm parameter baseline end 90 day treatment male subject MS : - Semen volume total sperm count per ejaculate ; - Sperm motility ; - Sperm morphology ; - Plasma level reproductive hormone : Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , total testosterone ; - The recovery subject 50 % decrease sperm parameter 90 day discontinuation IP ; - The safety tolerability IP .</detailed_description>
