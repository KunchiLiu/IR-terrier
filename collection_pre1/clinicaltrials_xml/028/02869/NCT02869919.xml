	<detailed_description>Vitamin D important role calcium homeostasis regulation bone metabolism . It also appear play role various infectious , immunologic , neurologic , cardiovascular respiratory disorder . Both , biological observational study identify vitamin D deficiency risk factor adverse outcomes critical illness . However , administration high dose vitamin D general population critically ill patient vitamin D deficiency reduce mortality hospital length stay . The exception pre-defined sub-group patient Vitamin D level low range ( &lt; 30 nmol/L ) hospital mortality significantly low patient treat Vitamin D. Vitamin D Metabolism The majority vitamin D produce direct action sunlight 7-dehydrocholesterol skin . The inert Vitamin D3 produce manner , together Vitamin D2 D3 dietary source , require hydroxylation liver 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] main circulating form . Conversion still inactive substance active form , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ] , enzyme 1α-hydroxylase occurs primarily , exclusively , proximal renal tubule . Circulatory phosphorous , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) play important regulatory role process . FGF23 bone derive hormone inhibits renal tubular absorption phosphate reduces circulate 1,25 ( OH ) 2D . PTH hormone secrete parathyroid gland response hypocalcaemia . It act increase concentration calcium several pathways one upregulation 1α-hydroxylase , enzyme responsible convert 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D . The majority 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D bound Vitamin D Binding Protein ( VDBP ) circulation . The nuclear Vitamin D Receptors ( VDR ) regulate transcription expression Vitamin D target gene activate unbound 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , less 1 % total circulating Vitamin D. Vitamin D chronic kidney disease In patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) chronic dialysis , Vitamin D deficiency common ( &gt; 80 % ) , supplementation active Vitamin D preparation strongly recommend prevent ameliorate effect hyperparathyroid high-turnover bone disease reduce cardiovascular risk . Vitamin D general ICU patient ICUs worldwide report Vitamin D deficiency range 60-100 % . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) general population critically ill patient vitamin D deficiency show administration high dose vitamin D reduce mortality hospital length stay . The exception pre-defined sub-group patient Vitamin D level low range ( &lt; 30 nmol/L ) hospital mortality significantly low patient treat Vitamin D. Another RCT investigate role 2 different dos cholecalciferol 50 critically ill adult systemic inflammatory response syndrome . The study show prior randomization 56 % patient classify Vitamin D deficient . By day 7 randomization , Vitamin D level normalize &gt; 60 % patient PTH level decrease study period . Vitamin D AKI AKI abrupt deterioration kidney function develop hour day variety reason range mild impairment acute kidney failure . It affect &gt; 50 % critically ill patient worldwide independently associate increase risk complication , long stay hospital high risk die . AKI survivor increase risk CKD premature mortality . A recent study also confirm significantly increase risk bone fracture patient survive episode AKI require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . The causal mechanism behind morbidity mortality associate AKI still fully understood Vitamin D may play important role . The hypothesis study critically ill patient AKI significantly low Vitamin D level critically ill patient without AKI .</detailed_description>
