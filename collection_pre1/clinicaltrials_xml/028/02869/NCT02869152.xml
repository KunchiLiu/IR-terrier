	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop technique allows physician identify first lymph node drain rectal tumor ( sentinel lymph node ) . Currently , technique use find lymph node rectum surgery therefore many patient rectal cancer need undergo total rectal resection . Dyes , tracer , image gamma probe use study standard minimally invasive transanal endoscopic surgery ( TES ) try locate lymph node . If surgeon able locate lymph node remove surgery . If technique successfully developed result research , could help patient future early stage rectal cancer allow doctor see cancer spread lymph node rectum without undergo total rectal resection . These patient would able undergo TES combine lymph node dissection gain knowledge stage disease . This knowledge would use determine treatment necessary patient 's rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
