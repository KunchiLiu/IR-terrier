	<brief_summary>The purpose demonstrate concordance diagnostic information obtain : 1. conventional examination 2 distinct recording D.SPECT camera 99mTc-sestamibi injection , first post-stress second rest , 2 3 hour later , 2. double isotope examination supplementary record injection little activity thallium-201 rest first record second injection 99mTc-sestamibi conventional record rest , patient show abnormality myocardial perfusion stress myocardial tomoscintigraphy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress Rest Myocardial Tomoscintigraphies Using Mono- Double-isotope Protocol With Semiconductor Camera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myocardial perfusion tomoscintigraphy use diagnosis characterization abnormality stress rest myocardial perfusion . This examination perform semiconductor gamma camera performant conventional camera regard spatial resolution , detection sensitivity energy resolution . The amelioration energy resolution could allow realization simultaneous recording dye inject rest another inject stress ( double isotope record ) , conventional examination need 2 different recording , stress rest , separate several hour . In study patient undergo conventional examination D.SPECT camera 2 recording , first injection little activity 99mTc-sestamibi stress ( ≤ 100 MBq ) second , 2 hour later , injection rest 3 time big activity 99mTc-sestamibi ( ≤ 300 MBq ) . An activity thallium-201 ( ≤ 50 MBq ) inject rest first record stress . 5 minute later , supplementary double isotope record realize D.SPECT camera ( 99mTc-Sestamibi-stress / thallium201-rest ) . The demonstration hypothesis study could considerably diminish duration examination ( 3 4 hour less 1 hour ) .</detailed_description>
