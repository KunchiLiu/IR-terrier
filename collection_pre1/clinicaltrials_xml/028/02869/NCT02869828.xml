	<brief_summary>Core temperature monitor mandatory major surgery . The accurate technique currently use invasive , artery catheter oesophagal probe . A new non-invasive cutaneous device , 3M SpotOn , use Zero Heath-Flux method , continuously measure core temperature . This prospective study compare accuracy Zero-Heath-Flux oesophagal temperature ( 30 patient ) artery catheter ( 20 patient ) adult patient surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central Temperature Monitoring Zero-heath-flux Non-invasive Technic Compared Two Invasive Technic During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every patient undergo heavy surgery central temperature monitoring , arterial catheter surgery require ( 30 patient arm ) , otherwise investigator use oesophagus tube ( 20 patient ) . We also monitor every 50 patient non-invasive method 3M spot ( Zero-heath-flux technic ) order measure fiability validity surgery .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients schedule undergo general anaesthesia gut surgery last 2 hour Patients core temperature monitor oesophagal probe ( 30 patient ) oesophagal probe PICCO device ( 20 patient ) Patients without opposition study information give Patients frontal cutaneous decay wich avoid use 3M Spoton Patients oesophagal probe prohibit ( oesophagal varix , oesophagal surgery ) Pregnant woman breastfeed , woman may become pregnant unless adequate contraceptive measure</criteria>
