	<brief_summary>The goal research study learn pancreas . The investigator want use Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) learn size normal pancreas . MRCP special kind MRI exam produce detailed image pancreas . The investigator also want figure much fluid pancreas release response secretin . Secretin chemical body cause pancreas release fluid help digestion . Secretin use MRCP ( MR-PFT ) help identify dysfunction pancreas . MR elastography ( MRE ) use measure hard pancreas . MRE special kind MRI use vibration image tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRCP : A Reliable , Non Invasive Method Staging Chronic Pancreatitis Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction/Methods : Pancreatic fibrosis end stage chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) , lead loss acinar volume secretory capacity , ultimately pancreatic insufficiency ( PI ) . CP congenital PI affect pediatric population , increasingly recognize child . PI serious negative implication child 's growth health , diagnose early , PI treat , minimize detrimental effect PI . Currently , direct pancreatic function test ( PFT ) via collection pancreatic fluid `` gold standard '' diagnosis PI invasive testing may require sedation general anesthesia . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) secretin administration ( MR-PFT ) MR elastography ( MRE ) may allow non-invasive , potentially early diagnosis CP PI . Currently , however , normative data compare MR-PFT MRE result pediatric patient suspect CP/PI available . Aims : The investigator propose determine normal range secrete pancreatic fluid volume response secretin administration determine normal range pancreatic parenchymal stiffness pediatric population affect pancreatic disease . To date , investigator validate MRCP technique successfully perform MR-PFT MRE CP patient ; however normative data essential validation non-invasive technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects age 6 15.9 year . 2 . Subjects without documented history ( suggestive ) pancreatic disease 1 . History pancreatic disease , liver disease , intraabdominal neoplasm , abdominal inflammatory process inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , systemic illness may affect pancreatic state ( e.g . cystic fibrosis ) . 2 . Subjects surgical hardware/implanted device make ineligible MRI ( e.g . pacemaker implant medical device approve MRI ) . 3 . Subjects require form sedation general anesthesia MRI . 4 . Subjects unable breathhold require 1520 second image sequence . 5 . Subjects pregnant less 12 month postpartum .</criteria>
