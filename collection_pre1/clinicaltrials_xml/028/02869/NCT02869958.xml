	<brief_title>Digital Action Plan Asthma Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma frequent chronic disease ( 10 % prevalence child 7 % adult ) acute exacerbation occur require adequate treatment , usually patient and/or his/her caregiver . Despite action plan asthma exacerbation recommend national international guideline , urgent medical contact often Emergency Department visit remain frequent asthma exacerbation . Reasons medical contact may relate inefficiency current Written Action Plan stereotype advice whatever level severity exacerbation , patient might paper him/her he/she need .

Both arm Written Action Plan respect current recommendation ; experimental arm addition possibility connect AppWeb obtain advice Digital Action Plan . The investigator hypothesize use digital action plan could reduce avoidable unscheduled visit due mild moderate exacerbation could successfully manage patient his/her caregiver . In long run , kind program could also become tool telemedicine Statistical analysis : 25 % child 20 % adults patient include exacerbation within 3 month ( TENOR study ) . The expected effect 10 % ( relative variation ) child 20 % ( relative variation ) adult decrease main outcome , Written Action Plan use child target onto acute exacerbation compare one use adult target onto asthma control . With feature , sample N= 106 N= 123 per group necessary ( 80 % power , bilateral alpha risk 5 % exact test use child statistical distribution binary variable ) . With expect attrition 10 % , total 240 child 270 adult include . Number participate center = 27</detailed_description>
