	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial compare 9-month effect lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) Prostatic Artery Embolization ( PAE ) use Embosphere® versus Standard Combined Therapy ( alpha-blocker plus 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor ) patient symptomatic BPH fail first line medical treatment alpha-blocker . The secondary objective study : - Estimate impact 2 strategy benign prostatic hyperplasia specific Health Status ( i.e . urinary sexual sign symptom ) 3 , 9 , 18 , 24 month , well side effect 2 strategy ; - Report safety PAE ; - Evaluate patient 's adherence medical treatment ; - Analyse cost strategy report incremental efficiency ( incremental cost utility ratio ) prostatic artery embolization compare medical treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostatic Artery Embolization Versus Medical Treatment Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) primary cause low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) affect &gt; 50 % men &gt; 60 year . Moderate severe symptom prevalence around 14 % France , proportion men moderate severe symptom double decade age . The first-line treatment bothersome BPH-related LUTS medical therapy recommend French European guideline . 5α reductase inhibitor ( 5-ARI ) combine alpha-blocker allow reduction size prostate LUTS improvement . The severity symptom usually assess use International prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) standard questionnaire objective assessment LUTS . Recently , Prostatic Artery Embolization ( PAE ) propose treat symptomatic BPH good safety efficacy single-centre study ( 12-point IPSS reduction 3 month maintain one year . In randomized trial compare PAE versus transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) , Gao report 16-point IPSS reduction 6 month , increase maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) comprise 12 ml/s 24 ml/s 6 month 21 ml/s 2 year . The complication rate low ( case bladder ulcer publish ) patient generally experience mild post-embolization symptom day . PAE perform one-day hospitalisation could attractive patient insufficient benefit medical treatment side effect affect quality life . The used device PAE Embosphere® ( Merit Medical ) . It bear European CE ( Conforme aux Exigences ) mark specific indication approximately 500 patient treated worldwide . Nonetheless , big randomize study proven efficacy compare best medical treatment . A study compare PAE use Embosphere® surgery ( TURP ) currently enrol patient ; patient could include France men BPH refuse potentially assigned surgical arm . To properly evaluate PAE , investigator design PARTEM trial , receive support Societe Francaise de Radiologie ( French society radiology ) Association Francaise d'Urologie ( French association urology ) . PARTEM compare prospectively benefit PAE use Embosphere® benefit combine medical treatment ( Combodart® : Dutasteride 0.5mg Tamsulosin 0.4mg ) 9 month extend follow 24 month order evaluate stability result group . The investigator plan multicentre , prospective , randomize , open label , parallel trial , compare PAE Combined Therapy ( CT : alpha-blocker + 5-ARI treatment ) . Treatments allocate minimization 1:1 ratio , base study centre , IPSS score ( moderate/severe ) prostate volume ( &lt; 80 g/≥80 g ) . This study design demonstrate superiority PAE decrease LUTS compare best medical treatment .</detailed_description>
