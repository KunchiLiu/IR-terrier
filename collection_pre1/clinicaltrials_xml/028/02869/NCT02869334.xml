	<brief_title>Remediation Auditory Recognition Schizophrenia With tDCS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use experimental procedure call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Little known tDCS affect brain people diagnose schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder trouble certain kind hear . This study do see experimental computer train program , combine tDCS , help people hear well . In tDCS , small amount electricity pass electrode place head able stimulate brain . By stimulate brain , investigator believe function brain alter . This study test whether stimulation brain , do computer training , improve hear ability improvement help way , like detect change someone 's tone voice understand people 's emotion well .
