	<detailed_description>Iodinated contrast medium ( CM ) essential component contemporary image interventional study . Although CM generally well tolerate , causally link acute kidney injury know contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) , third lead cause acute kidney injury hospitalize patient . Preexisting renal impairment , diabetes mellitus , advanced age , congestive heart failure , large volume repeat use CM identify risk factor CIN . CIN consequence CM-induced local renal ischemia combination direct toxic effect renal tubular cell . Subsequent inflammation may cause tissue damage reperfusion period . Apart intravenous hydration preventive strategy CIN lacking . The complement system consist several circulate protein implicate first-line defence pathogen removal die cell . Following renal ischemia activation lectin pathway complement particular associate local tissue damage kidney . Conestat alfa recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor , inhibit activation complement system license Europe USA treatment hereditary condition ( hereditary angioedema ) . Conestat alfa markedly reduce tissue damage experimental model renal ischemia reperfusion injury , investigate human ischemia . The Recombinant Human C1 Esterase Inhibitor Prevention Contrast-induced Nephropathy High-risk Subjects ( PROTECT ) Study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind single-center trial ass effect prophylactic administration Conestat alfa degree acute kidney injury subject undergo elective coronary angiography . Patient estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; =50 ml/min/1.73 m2 least one additional risk factor CIN enrol randomly assign 1 ) Conestat alfa 50 U/kg give intravenous injection immediately 4 hour coronary angiography 2 ) placebo ( sodium chloride ) . All patient receive standard intravenous hydration isotonic saline . Surrogate marker kidney injury include serum creatinine cystatin C urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin TIMP2 * Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) assess 48 hour time period . In addition , increase troponin T , marker cardiac damage , assess . Patients follow thromboembolic , anaphylactic composite endpoint cardiovascular renal event 12 week period . The primary outcome measure peak change urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin within 48 hour elective coronary angiography . Total hydration contrast medium volume record . Serum C1 esterase inhibitor level immediately 10 minute administration Conestat alfa placebo assess .</detailed_description>
