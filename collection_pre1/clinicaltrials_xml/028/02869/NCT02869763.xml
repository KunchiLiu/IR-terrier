	<detailed_description>The introduction call 'endocrine module ' athlete 's biological passport need consider numerous report show effect ethanol ingestion steroid profile . A steroid profile would useful longitudinal monitoring statistical evaluation alter uncontrolled circumstance , particularly alcohol consumption . There urgent need study perpetuation alcohol ingestion cause individual steroid profile possible establish cut-off value marker ethanol ingestion grant steroid profile determine affected ingestion . Subjects genotyped genetic deletion polymorphism uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B17 gene ( UGT2B17 ) relate testosterone glucuronidation regulation . The objective clinical trial study intra-individual variation steroid profile parameter result ingestion different dos ethanol Caucasian woman ( complement previous study perform men ) .</detailed_description>
