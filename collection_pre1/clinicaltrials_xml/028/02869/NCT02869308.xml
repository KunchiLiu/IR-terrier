	<brief_summary>The purpose determine whether measurement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) obtain angiography record conventional Anger camera D-SPECT camera equivalent . Secondary purpose : - To evaluate influence cardiac activity record D-SPECT camera equivalence define primary purpose - To evaluate influence indication examination distinct analysis group examination know suspect cardiomyopathy ( LVEF often abnormally low ) group examination chemotherapy supervision heart initially consider healthy ( LVEF often normal ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Using Cardiac Angioscintigraphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac angioscintigraphy examination simple , precise reproducible measurement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . It need injection 99mTc label albumin red cell unfortunately injected activity must relatively considerable ( â‰ˆ 900 MBq ) image record time shorter 10 minute . This examination thus quite irradiant ( 10 mSv ) inconvenient could eliminate new semiconductor camera . These new camera allow good image quality conventional Anger camera ( well spatial resolution energy ) detection sensitivity almost 10 time higher . However , new camera record 3D image whereas conventional camera angioscintigraphy usually perform bidimensional way possible high precision reproducibility LVEF measurement . In study , patient need routine examination LVEF measurement undergo conventional examination follow examination semiconductor camera ( without supplementary injection ) . If LVEF measurement semiconductor camera precise reproducible conventional camera , angioscintigraphy could perform new camera low body irradiation patient .</detailed_description>
