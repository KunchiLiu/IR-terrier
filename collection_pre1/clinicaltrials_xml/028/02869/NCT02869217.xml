	<brief_summary>The target population phase I study TBI-1301 patient advance solid tumor . Patients ' tumor require express NY-ESO-1 , include limited ovarian cancer , synovial sarcoma , esophageal cancer malignant melanoma . Patients must positive HLA-A*02:01 HLA-A*02:06 patient 's tumor tissue must positive NY-ESO-1 antigen expression . The study take subject 's T cell , natural type immune cell blood , send laboratory modify . The changed T cell use study subject 's T cell genetically change aim attack destroy cancer cell . The manufacturing T cell take 1 month complete . The T cell give back subject intravenous infusion . The purpose study test safety genetically change T cell find effect , , subject advance solid tumor . The purpose study evaluate safety profile TBI-1301 , determine recommend phase 2 ( RP2D ) dose TBI-1301 administer follow cyclophosphamide pre-treatment evaluate evidence efficacy TBI-1301 use RECIST v1.1 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic recurrent unresectable solid tumor . HLAA*02:01 HLAA*02:06 positive . Tumor NYESO1 expression immunohistochemistry . No anticancer chemotherapy , radiation therapy immunotherapy within 2 week PBMC harvest . If approve funded standard therapy available , subject must fail , intolerant , ineligible , refuse treatment . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 10 mm CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Patients must radiographic evidence disease progression follow recent line treatment . Areas previous radiation may serve measurable disease unless evidence progression post radiation . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Age ≥18 year consent . Life expectancy great 4 month . The following laboratory requirement must meet ( within 14 day prior phlebotomy generation TBI1301 ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x109/L ( 1500/μL ) WBC ≥ 2,500/μl Lymphocytes ≥ 500/μl Hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L Platelets ≥ 75,000/μl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤2.5X Gilbert 's disease ) AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3.0 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN know liver metastasis ) Creatinine ≥ 60 ml/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault ) Consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness medical condition may interfere trial participation ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , severe active peptic ulcer disease gastritis , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability subject give write informed consent . Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year . NOTE : Subjects vitiligo , Grave 's disease , Hashimoto 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within past 2 year ) exclude . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( eg , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . History primary immunodeficiency . History organ transplant require use immunosuppressive . Known allergy streptomycin sulfate amphotericin B. Untreated central nervous system metastases require concurrent treatment , inclusive limited surgery , radiation , and/or corticosteroid . If treat lesion show stable 1 month subject may eligible . Other invasive malignancy within 2 year except noninvasive malignancy cervical carcinoma situ , nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin ductal carcinoma situ breast has/have surgically cure . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 14 day phlebotomy , exception intranasal , topical , inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent . Oral steroid use premedication prevent allergic reaction radiologic contrast allow . Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation TBI1301 interpretation subject safety study result . Known history tuberculosis . HIV positive . Active HTLV syphilis infection . Active hepatitis B infection ( hepatitis B surface antigen HBV DNA positive ) . Active hepatitis C infection ( hepatitis C antibody positive , HCV RNA positive ) .</criteria>
