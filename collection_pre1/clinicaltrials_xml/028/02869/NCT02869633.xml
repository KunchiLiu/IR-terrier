	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study use ibrutinib start day 60 day 90 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) 12 month post hematopoietic cell transplant improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) 12 month post hematopoietic cell transplant 25 % compare historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To increase incidence successful outcome ( define lack requirement second line therapy acute graft-versus-host disease , lack National Institutes Health [ NIH ] severe chronic graft-versus-host disease , lack progression relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia/mantle cell lymphoma [ MCL ] , lack death disease non-relapse cause ) least 60 % 1 year post hematopoietic cell transplant . ( Cohort A ) II . To study safety tolerability ibrutinib post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) III . To study incidence grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease first 6 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) IV . To study incidence second line therapy ( systemic ) acute graft-versus-host disease first 6 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) V. To study incidence recurrent acute graft-versus-host disease first 6 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) VI . To study incidence severity chronic graft-versus-host disease first 12 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient not-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) VII . To study incidence lung involvement graft-versus-host disease first 12 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) VIII . To study incidence sclerotic skin chronic graft-versus-host disease first 12 month post hematopoietic cell transplant patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) IX . To study incidence infectious death relate graft-versus-host disease patient non-Hodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Cohort A B combine ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study association minimal residual disease ( MRD ) detect immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) sequence prior start ibrutinib compare post ibrutinib month 6 , 9 12 HCT . ( Cohort A ) II . To study impact onset new acute chronic graft-versus-host disease minimal residual disease . ( Cohort A ) III . To study association T-cell clonality T cell receptor ( TCR ) Vb sequence prior start ibrutinib compare post ibrutinib month 6 , 9 12 hematopoietic cell transplant . ( Cohort A ) IV . To study impact onset new acute chronic graft-versus-host disease T cell receptor sequence . ( Cohort A ) V. To study association B cell receptor signal pathway immune function response single cell mass cytometry prior start ibrutinib compare post ibrutinib month 6 , 9 12 hematopoietic cell transplant . ( Cohort A ) VI . To study association single cell mass cytometry investigate B cell receptor signal association new acute chronic graft-versus-host disease B-cell receptor ( BCR ) signal . ( Cohort A ) OUTLINE : Beginning 60-90 day post donor stem cell transplant , patient receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 1 year post donor stem cell transplant absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
