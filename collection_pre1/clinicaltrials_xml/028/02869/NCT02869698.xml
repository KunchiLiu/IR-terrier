	<brief_title>Spectral Dynamic Imaging Cognitive Functions Epileptic Patients Explored Stereoelectroencephalography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive deficit epilepsy surgery poorly know particularly tool use evaluate . In addition , prevention certain postoperative deficit , extremely difficult lack robust marker anticipate . The various examination conventionally use purpose ( neuropsychological testing , functional MRI cortical stimulation ) indeed provide insufficient information difficult interpret , development improve method appear imperative field epilepsy surgery . SID appear particularly adapt case epileptic patient explore SEEG provide individualized cognitive map millimeter thereof without require , additional invasive act , risk inducing unintended crisis . In practice , clinical research project lead definition several simple cognitive task , together , could achieve volunteer patient two three hour , analyze similar time provide fast , even patient still explore SEEG even cortical electrical stimulation , list brain region involve major cognitive function .</detailed_description>
