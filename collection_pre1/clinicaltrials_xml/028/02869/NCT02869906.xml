	<brief_title>Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio Fractional Flow Reserve Assessment Non Culprit Lesions Patients With ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 30 % patient present ST elevation myocardial infarction multivessel coronary artery disease angiography . Whether percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) limit culprit lesion apply angiographically critical non-culprit lesion still debatable . The FAME 2 study show Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) -guided PCI , adenosine infusion , reduce MACE compare medical therapy alone . In fact , accord recent ESC clinical guideline , FFR guide PCI class I , evidence level A . Previous study , confirm FFR value non-culprit coronary lesion STEMI patient provide similar value acute phase compare subacute phase , 5-7 day primary PCI . Consequently , possible ass angiographically borderline non-culprit lesion acute phase hence risk stratify STEMI patient , thus reduce duration hospital stay decrease need additional non-invasive stress test detect residual myocardial ischemia . However , assessment angiographically borderline lesion use FFR limitation relate use adenosine , increase risk bradyarrhythmias high degree atrioventricular block , especially acute phase . This would make functional assessment non-culprit lesion always possible acute phase . Recently , new functional algorithm , call `` instantaneous wave-free ratio '' ( iFR ) introduce . Similar FFR , give functional assessment coronary lesion measure trans-stenotic gradient ventricular diastole , intramyocardial resistance minimal constant . This phase show comparable maximum hyperemic state FFR assessment . The measurement iFR acute phase STEMI yet evaluate . AIM : The aim study assess reliability instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR ) fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurements non-culprit coronary lesion acute subacute phase ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . METHOD : Patients undergo primary PCI STEMI present multivessel coronary disease ( least one ≥ 50 % diameter stenosis non-infarct-related coronary artery ) enrol prospective observational registry . Coronary lesion evaluate iFR FFR immediately primary PCI ( acute phase ) 7 ± 3 day later ( subacute phase ) .</detailed_description>
