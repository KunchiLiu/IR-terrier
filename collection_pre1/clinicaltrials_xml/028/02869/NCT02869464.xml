	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine percentage patient present abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) also intracranial aneurysm ( IA ) conversely ; examine percentage patient present intracranial aneurysm also abdominal aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator previously generate estimate cost effectiveness arm reciprocal screen protocol base literature dervied estimate coprevalence key factor decision tree model compare cost outcomes . They measure expect outcomes use quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . The current study involve establishment true co-prevalence recalculation ICERs QALYs . Based literature derive model previously find ICER $ 34.01/QALY AAA screen IA patient ICER $ 6,401.91/QALY IA screen AAA patient . Both well societal accept threshold $ 60,000/QALY . However , model sensitive co-prevalence . In current study investigator therefore determine actual cost-effectiveness perform additional radiographic procedure genetic counseling . The investigator also bank DNA RNA future research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old Clinical radiographic diagnosis either abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) intracranial cerebral aneurysm ( IA ) . Aneurysm may symptomatic ( s/p rupture mass effect ) asymptomatic ( detected part screen incidentally discover . Aneurysms int brain may multiple . AAA define &gt; = 3 cm image modality . IA define &gt; = 3 mm image modality . Able provide valid inform consent ( self legally authorize representative ) Contraindication MRI/A ( embed metal , intractable claustrophobia , pacemaker , etc . ) Intracranial aneurysm associate arteriovenous malformation Clinical radiographic diagnosis mycotic aneurysm Substantial preexist neurological psychiatric illness would confound neurological assessment outcome assessment . Other serious condition make patient unlikely survive long enough benefit screen program . Inability follow protocol return screen test genetic counseling . Unwilling report image genetic counselor sent clinician ( PCP , test surgeon , etc ) Note : Pregnancy reason exclude , image do study postpone subject give birth .</criteria>
