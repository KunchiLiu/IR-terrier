	<brief_title>SYNchronizing Exercises , Remedies GaIt Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercises , specifically resistance aerobic training , demonstrate improve cognitive outcome , along improved physical capacity mobility . Both aerobic resistance training trial different duration reveal positive result , consistent finding observe combined intervention 6 month one year . Although train benefit progressive resistance training ( PRT ) well document , PRT study far less extensively old adult Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Exercise training proven beneficial cognition even vulnarable population like frail older adult , mobility issue . The exact mechanism support benefit exercise cognition human need explore , numerous study animal human demonstrate aerobic exercise may neuroprotective neurorestorative effect . The rationale combining aerobic PRT multimodal exercise intervention support research reveal potential beneficial effect . In addition , multimodal exercise intervention show positive effect muscle/lean mass , cognition brain structure , functionality , brain volume . Similarly cognitive training , i.e . computer base cognitive process training , also show positive result improve cognition , mobility , postural control . Several recent systematic review topic support benefit cognitive training . In line exercise training , recent research cognitive training also support important improvement brain plasticity post-intervention . Finally , Vitamin D3 deficiency old adult link cognitive dysfunction , dementia , mobility decline . Besides well-known effect muscle bone physiology , several study show potential beneficial role Vitamin D3 cognitive function . Robustly design trial , longitudinal follow-up , recommend old adult MCI investigate comparative benefit isolate Vitamin D3 supplementation , combine physical cognitive training . To date , effect add cognitive training and/or Vitamin D3 multimodal progressive exercise training improve global cognition , executive function , memory , gait MCI assess .</detailed_description>
