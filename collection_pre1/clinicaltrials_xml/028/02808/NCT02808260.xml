	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) often start short episode rapid irregular heartbeat detect implanted pacemaker defibrillator . Usually people n't know episode . Over time , episode happen often last long period . In people , heart eventually remain permanently fast irregular rhythm , know atrial fibrillation . This condition lead stroke blood clot . If physician could detect atrial fibrillation early stage could treat people early possibly prevent condition become permanent . People implanted device allow unique opportunity constantly monitor heart rhythm investigator detect irregularity immediately . Investigators n't know people risk develop short episode fast irregular heartbeat lead atrial fibrillation . The purpose study find proteins chemical change blood predict risk develop atrial fibrillation . These chemical change , also know biomarkers , may also able give investigator clue atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) consider progressive condition start episode paroxysmal AF ( short run AF ) , progress persistent AF ( revert normal rhythm ) eventually permanent AF . More 25 % people paroxysmal AF go develop persistent chronic atrial fibrillation . The progression rate around 5 % per annum . AF result devastate outcome stroke/TIA systemic embolic event . In people implanted device ICDs , investigator detect non-symptomatic rapid atrial arrhythmia , know subclinical atrial fibrillation ( SCAF ) , become symptomatic . In ASSERT trial , SCAF detect 10 % patient newly implant device within first 3 month . Of , nearly 16 % develop clinical atrial fibrillation within 2.5 year vs 3 % exhibit SCAF within first 3 month . During follow period , 24.5 % patient develop SCAF . People SCAF also high risk stroke systemic embolism . Earlier diagnosis treatment AF may lead good prevention outcome . The availability serum base biomarkers predict early onset atrial fibrillation , may help identification patient risk develop AF early . This would also allow identification patient population suitable evaluation possible future intervention strategy prevent onset atrial fibrillation , alter natural history complication . In study investigator study patient new permanent pacemaker defibrillator implant . These device continuously monitor patient 's heart rhythm , detect irregularity . Patients device follow outpatient clinic regular basis . The information device download follow visit analyze staff clinic . Investigators recruit patient study 4 week device implant . After obtain consent , investigator collect blood sample measure biomarkers . They interview participant regard previous health history , smoking , alcohol consumption , family history current medication . Investigators measure blood pressure heart rate . After one year participant return clinical follow visit , another blood sample drawn biomarkers . Any irregular heart rhythm detect implanted device record . Investigators also ask participant regard illness hospitalization past year . Participants ' medical record review annually next 10 year , monitor irregular heart rhythm , hospitalization death .</detailed_description>
