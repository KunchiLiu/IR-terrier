	<detailed_description>Psoriasis chronic inflammatory skin condition result significant impact patient ' quality life . To quantify severity psoriasis consistent clinically meaningful way important order decide therapeutic orientation take patient . PASI ( Psoriasis Area Severity Index ) score recognise gold standard psoriasis assessment . However measure PASI score complex . Given complexity , PASI influence inter intra-rater variation . In addition PASI assessment process time consume . The bodystudio ATBM ( Automatic Total Body Mapping ) high-tech system perform standardize photo head foot angle , allow map entire skin cover human body minute . The mapping entire body automatically do use digital camera perform 20 picture patient 8 successive position . The system couple software automatic analysis picture measure PASI score . The primary objective study would evaluate ability bodystudio ATBM calculate PASI score patient psoriasis</detailed_description>
