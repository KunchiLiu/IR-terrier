	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicentric , randomize , open label Phase II trial investigate whether oral angiogenesis inhibitor nintedanib , compare intravenous cytotoxic compound ifosfamide , give patient advance , inoperable and/or metastatic STS failure first line chemotherapy prolongs progression-free survival . The primary objective trial evaluate whether nintedanib give second-line therapy advance , inoperable and/or metastatic STS prolongs progression-free survival compare ifosfamide . Secondary objective evaluate efficacy nintedanib compare ifosfamide term progression-free survival rate 12 week , overall survival , objective response rate , patient benefit rate , response duration , total duration treatment nintedanib safety , Health relate Quality Life Health Economics . Exploratory objective include analysis putative predictive biomarkers anti-tumor effect investigational agent nintedanib.treatment .</brief_summary>
