	<brief_summary>Chinese male subject invite participate research study brown fat , special tissue body design burn energy make heat . The objective learn importance gene call `` PRDM-16 '' function brown fat . Subjects select possible subject study fulfil age weight criterion . 500 subject Singhealth Investigational Medicine Unit healthy volunteer database recruit period 2 year . All subject PRDM-16 gene sequence . The objective identify subject mutation , change , PRDM-16 gene . About 12 subject PRDM-16 mutation expect identified . Samples blood obtain course study store analysed purpose study period exceed 2 year , destroy completion study , unless subject agreeable donate sample National Heart Centre Singapore continuous storage future study approve institutional review board..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Metabolic Characterization Cohort Human Subjects With Mutations PRDM-16</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term objective study develop new treatment obesity obesity-associated disorder diabetes dyslipidemia . The recent finding active brown fat depot adult human provide excite new strategy treatment disease . Brown fat specialize organ find primarily small mammal . Brown fat unique capability burn fuel high rate order generate heat . The role brown fat mammal defend cold exposure . Human infant active brown fat deposit locate intra-scapular region . This brown fat depot regress age long think adult human brown fat tissue . Recent study demonstrate presence brown fat activity adult human follow exposure cold . Brown fat adult human concentrate cervical region display sex-specific difference . Furthermore size depot inversely correlate BMI age subject . This finding generate intense interest open possibility harness brown fat mean combat obesity obesity-related disorder man . Indeed , maneuver activate brown fat human show cause reduction fat mass . Much understand brown fat biology come work mouse . Of particular relevance treatment human disease several finding . First , increase brown fat activity mouse render animal resistant development obesity high fat diet . Second , level insulin sensitivity directly relate brown fat activity . Finally , transcription factor factor PR-domain containing protein 16 ( PRDM-16 ) crucial direct biology brown fat . The overall goal study translate finding mouse study brown fat human subject . This important first step process develop brown fat-targeted therapy treat human metabolic disease obesity insulin resistance . In view investigator interested answer several question . First , human mutation PRDM-16 defect brown fat activity ? Recently , human mutation PRDM-16 identify find cardiomyopathy phenotype . The brown fat function individual describe . By employ genetic screen volunteer investigator hope identify subject Singapore defect PRDM-16 . Prior study humans suggest size brown fat depot inversely correlate BMI age subject depot size varies sex . In order eliminate BMI , age sex confound variable investigator include male subject Chinese race age 21 50 BMI great 18.5 less 30 . The investigator include Chinese subject avoid confound initial study variable relate race subject . The identification human subject carry mutation PRDM-16 set stage study attempt several research question . These include whether human PRDM-16 mutation defect brown fat metabolic consequence human defective brown fat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male Chinese Age &gt; = 21 = &lt; 50 BMI &gt; =18.5 = &lt; 30 Ability provide write , informed consent . To control investigator include adult Chinese men le 50 year old . Since obesity also alter brown fat function investigator exclude BMI &gt; 30 . Diagnosis DM2 Use beta blocker , TZD ( ie rosiglitazone/pioglitazone ) metformin Since subject recruit IMU healthy volunteer database prior history DM2 medication use . Nevertheless , diagnosis DM2 use drug list alter brown fat activity interfere analysis . Presence pacemaker foreign metallic object eye . Future plan experiment identify cohort include cardiac MRI . Subjects pacemaker foreign metallic object eye ineligible potential followup study .</criteria>
