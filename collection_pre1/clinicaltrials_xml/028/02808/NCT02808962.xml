	<brief_summary>The procedure suppose ablate sacral lateral branch form medial cluneal nerve ( MCN ) . The anatomy sacral lateral branch , addition innervate SIJ , distal branch nerve also innervate skin buttock MCN ( 12,13 ) . SLB block ( usually 0.5 ml 1 % Lidocaine 0.5 % Bupivacaine ) perform proximal origin nerve SIJ cutaneous branch . Therefore , technically accurate block anesthetize SIJ also skin buttock regardless patient symptom . Hypoesthesia buttock would , therefore , quality-assurance sign block perform technically correct fashion . Similarly , target nerve accurately ablate RFA hypoesthesia buttock ensue , expect effect procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Typical standard care patient initial visit follow two diagnostic block ( ( 0.5 ml ) 1 % Lidocaine per level ) . They ask complete pain diary experience 75 % decrease NRS , schedule Cooled RFA lateral branch S1 , S2 , S3 dorsal ramus nerve dorsal ramus L5 nerve . If patient experience adequate pain relief either injection , determine cool RFA procedure work . Therefore , fail receive adequate pain relief either two injection , exit study alternative explore . The patient also exit study fail achieve success 1 month RFA treatment . The treatment study patient deviate standard care . - All study Patients - Visit 1 - Initial Visit During initial visit , eligible patient undergo routine physical examination determine subject eligible study . If eligible , physician explain study determine subject interested . Informed consent obtain patient schedule first fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic block 0.5 ml 1 % Lidocaine lateral branch S1 , S2 , S3 dorsal ramus nerve dorsal ramus L5 nerve . The baseline information , include 3-day average Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) regard level pain , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , analgesic consumption also obtain initial visit . - Visit 2 - First Diagnostic Block The participant ask question level pain ( NRS ) change analgesia medication since last visit . They undergo first fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic block ( DB ) 0.5 ml 1 % Lidocaine per level . A brief physical examination - include sensory exam buttock area - perform block patient give pain diary complete procedure pain intensity reach pre-procedure intensity ( see flowchart attach ) . The result exam document , i.e ; `` sensory deficit '' `` sensory deficit pinprick buttock area '' . Pain diary require patient scale pain intensity use NRS hourly basis document activity period time . This do accordance International Spine Intervention Society practice guideline respect diagnostic block prerequisite radiofrequency ablation . ( 14 ) . A follow-up appointment schedule 3-5 day first set diagnostic block ( appointment pre-scheduled conjunction appointment first diagnostic block ) . - Visit 3 - First Follow-up ( 3-5 day first block ) The patient evaluate , include NRS analgesia medication , pain diary reviewed . If 75 % decrease NRS report ≥ 2 hour procedure , patient schedule second set fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic block ( see Module 1 ) . According International Spine Intervention Society major insurer ' guideline , two `` positive '' diagnostic block necessary order proceed RFA . If first diagnostic block n't provide temporary ≥ 75 % pain relief , patient exit study . - Visit 4 - Confirmatory Block The participant ask question level pain ( NRS ) change analgesia medication since last visit . They undergo second fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic block 0.5 ml 1 % Lidocaine per A brief physical examination - include sensory exam buttock area - perform block patient give pain diary complete procedure pain intensity reach baseline ( see attach flowchart ) . The result sensory exam document , i.e ; `` sensory deficit '' `` sensory deficit pinprick buttock area '' . This do accordance International Spine Intervention Society practice guideline respect diagnostic block prerequisite radiofrequency ablation . ( 14 ) . A follow-up appointment schedule 3-5 day second set diagnostic block ( appointment pre-scheduled conjunction appointment second diagnostic block ) . - Visit 5 - Second Follow-up ( 3-5 day 2nd block ) The patient evaluate second follow-up appointment , include NRS analgesia medication , pain diary reviewed . If block `` negative , '' patient exit study follow-up treated alternative method ; `` positive '' , patient schedule Cooled RFA . - Visit 6 - Cooled RFA These subject experience `` positive '' response two set diagnostic block undergo Cooled RFA lateral branch S1 , S2 , S3 dorsal ramus nerve dorsal ramus L5 nerve describe Kapural et al . ( 15 ) . All patient evaluate buttock hypoesthesia immediately intervention . - Visit 7 - 1 Month Follow-up Cooled RFA At time , follow data collect : 3-day average NRS score , satisfaction treatment , ODI , analgesic consumption . Physical evaluation , include sensory exam buttock area do . If procedure successful ( NRS score improvement ≥ 50 % satisfaction treatment ) patient schedule second final follow-up 6 month post-intervention . Otherwise , exit study . - Visit 8 ( Final ) - 6 Month Follow-up Cooled RFA At time , follow data collect : 3-day average NRS score , satisfaction treatment , ODI , analgesic consumption . Physical evaluation , include sensory exam buttock area do . - Data collect The following data collect patient : Name , MRN , date visit , NRS score , ODI information , concomitant med , pain diary , treatment satisfaction , sensory exam info .</detailed_description>
