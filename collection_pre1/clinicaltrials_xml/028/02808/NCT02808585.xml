	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety , Tolerability PK Response Explore PD Response Following 4 Weekly SC Injections PB1046 Subjects With Stable Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction ( HFrEF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Qualifying subject diagnosis NYHA Class II III heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) , stable condition , take clinician-directed appropriate pharmacological therapy ( e.g. , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker evidence base beta blocker ) heart failure stable dos ( exception diuretic ) least 1 month prior screen . During period screen randomization ( plan first dose ) , study subject remain stable pharmacological therapy heart failure . Also study subject stable health hospitalization clinically significant acute illness screen randomization would put subject increase risk study participation . Randomized subject receive fix weekly dose study drug placebo 4 week dose period . Dose escalation subsequent cohort continue safety pharmacokinetic profile deem acceptable assessed Study Review Committee .</detailed_description>
