	<brief_title>Brain Correlates Self-Focused Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First , investigator propose identify neural correlate self-focused processing . The investigator assess baseline rest state connectivity within default network , well regional brain activation use well-validated event-related fMRI task manipulate self-focused processing patient body dysmorphic socially anxious symptom , compare healthy control . This clinical sample select patient display heighten self-focused attention , sample individual across symptom dimension ensure great variability dimension maladaptive self-focused processing . Second , investigator examine neural correlate self-focused processing predictor treatment response . Neuroimaging data acquire patient body dysmorphic socially anxious symptom two scan session , 12 week individual cognitive behavioral therapy , compare healthy control scan twice 12 week interval . Finally , investigator compare prediction treatment response neural measure behavioral measure self-focused processing . The investigator assess behavioral correlate self-focused process use self-reference effect paradigm , assess relation treatment response . If investigator hypotheses borne , investigator new target treatment , method identify promise candidate treatment , sensitive surrogate marker treatment response .</detailed_description>
