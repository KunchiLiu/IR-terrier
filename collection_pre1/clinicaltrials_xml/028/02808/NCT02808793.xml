	<criteria>1 . Provided write informed consent 2 . Male female age ≥18 ≤65 year time signing informed consent form 3 . Confirmed diagnosis ISM base World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion ( Appendix 1 ) 4 . Presence least 1 follow SM related symptom : 1 . Flushing ( least 1 episode per week ) 2 . Pruritus ( minimum MAS2 score 4 ) ( Appendix 2 ) 3 . Diarrhea ( minimum MAS2 score 4 ) ( Appendix 2 ) 4 . Anaphylaxis ( least 1 episode [ grade 2 high ] within last 12 month ) 5 . Serum total tryptase exceed 15 ng/mL* 2 measurement obtain 1 month apart within last 2 year ( *Note : varies minor criterion `` persistently exceed 20 ng/mL '' WHO criteria diagnosis ISM ) 6 . Willing able comply study procedure visit schedule , include followup visit 7 . Able communicate effectively study site personnel 8 . Negative Screening urine drug test ( alcohol , amphetamines/methamphetamines , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cannabinoids , cocaine , cotinine , methadone , methaqualone , opiates , phencyclidine ) 9 . Negative Screening ova parasite test 10 . Determined Investigator good health document medical history , physical examination ( PE ) , vital sign assessment , 12 lead ECG , clinical laboratory assessment , general observation 11 . Women child bear potential , must use highly effective method birth control ( failure rate &lt; 1 % per year use consistently correctly ) least 4 week prior Screening Day 85 . Women inform potential risk associate become pregnant enrol . Accepted form contraception implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) . In addition , barrier method must always use concomitantly highly effective method . Doublebarrier consider highly effective method . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) acceptable mean contraception .

Male patient female partner childbearing potential must agree use condom without spermicide sexual activity female partner childbearing potential . Female sexual partner male patient must willing avoid pregnancy accord describe method . 1 . Known hypersensitivity constituent study drug 2 . Presence associate hematologic nonmastcell lineage disorder MC leukemia 3 . Any disease condition ( medical surgical ) , opinion Investigator , might compromise hematologic , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , skeletal , central nervous system ; condition may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion AK002 , would place patient increase risk 4 . The presence abnormal laboratory value consider clinically significant Investigator 5 .
