	<brief_title>Topiramate Schizophrenia : Effects Weight Psychopathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic illness characterize social vocational disruptive functioning . While &gt; 70 % individual first episode illness respond antipsychotic ( APs ) , remain subgroup leave persist psychotic symptom . For individual , clozapine ( CLZ ) also sole drug treatment superiority , also carry great metabolic liability . Another complicate factor treat CLZ observation effective , 40-70 % individual fail show significant improvement CLZ , often leading augmentation strategy . While controlled trial , general lacking , number agent suggest useful . One group medication include anticonvulsant . Topiramate represent one newer anticonvulsant agent approve treatment epilepsy prophylaxis migraine . Importantly , topiramate posse weight-reducing effect substantiate meta-analysis non-psychiatric patient . Interestingly , topiramate study adjunctive therapy treatment-resistant schizophrenia evidence demonstrate small moderate benefit topiramate augmentation psychopathology . However , benefit must also weigh report ( primarily epilepsy population ) , topiramate may cause cognitive dysfunction . This study examine : 1 . Topiramate-related effect weight 2 . Topiramate-related effect glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity 3 . Topiramate-related effect psychopathology cognition 4 . Topiramate-related effect adiposity</detailed_description>
