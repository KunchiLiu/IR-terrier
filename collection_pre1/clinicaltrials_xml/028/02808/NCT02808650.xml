	<brief_title>Prexasertib Treating Pediatric Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose prexasertib ( LY2606368 ) administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion 60 minute , every 14 day 28-day cycle child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity LY2606368 administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics LY2606368 child recurrent refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity LY2606368 within confines phase 1 study . II . To examine checkpoint kinase ( CHK ) 1/2 expression status archival tumor tissue solid tumor pediatric patient use immunohistochemistry . III . To evaluate tumor tissue deletion and/or mutation tumor protein 53 ( Trp53 ) potential biomarker Chk1 inhibition . IV . To evaluate autophosphorylation Chk1 H2A histone family , member x ( H2AX ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell potential pharmacodynamic marker LY2606368 activity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive prexasertib IV 60 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
