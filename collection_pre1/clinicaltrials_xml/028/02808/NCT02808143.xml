	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy ( effect drug tumor ) tolerability ( effect drug body ) pembrolizumab , give single agent patient bladder tumor . Another purpose study see tumor characteristic associate increased efficacy pembrolizumab . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) antibody ( human protein stick part tumor and/or immune cell ) design allow body 's immune system work tumor cell . Pembrolizumab Food drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment advanced melanoma ( type skin cancer ) type lung cancer . It yet approve United States Food Drug Administration ( USFDA ) bladder cancer , hence consider investigational agent disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab BCG Solution Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) study drug ( pembrolizumab [ MK-3475 ] ) administer intravesically combination BCG patient high risk BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( individual maximum tolerate dose drug alone ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) MK-3475 combination BCG population . II . To assess safety tolerability combination MK-3475 BCG subject high risk BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) MK-3475 blood urine administer intravesically combination BCG . II . To measure humoral cellular response tumor antigens serum urine sample measure level cytokine ( ie , interleukin [ IL ] -2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-18 , interferon gamma [ IFN-gamma ] tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF-alpha ] ) peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype throughout treatment . III . To determine response rate term complete pathologic response population assess patient undergoes cystoscopies ( week 17 , 25 , 33 , 41 , 49 applicable ) . IV . To document progression rate associate combination intravesical MK-3475 BCG patient high risk BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer . V. To evaluate relationship tumor biomarkers program cell death ( PD ) -ligand ( L ) 1 , PD-L2 , PD-1 define immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) adverse effect recurrence rate . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pembrolizumab . PRE-INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravesically day -14 . INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive BCG solution intravesically weekly 6 week week 0-5 pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 week week 0 , 2 , 4 . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Beginning 2 week last dose BCG solution , patient receive pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 week 12 week week 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 total 6 dos . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravesically every 4 week week 21 , 25 , 29 , 33 , 37 , 41 , 45 , 49 total 8 dos . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
