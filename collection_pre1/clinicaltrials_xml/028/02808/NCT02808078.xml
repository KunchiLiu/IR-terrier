	<brief_summary>The GASPAR trial pragmatic , parallel-arms , single-center , non-blinded , superiority randomize control trial neurorehabilitation . The main objective test whether 4 week gait rehabilitation program use augmented reality superior conventional treadmill train program equivalent intensity . Baseline assessment precede allocation , consist block randomization ( 2:1 ratio ) stratification accord disease etiology . Post-intervention assessment serve compare short-term efficacy intervention two group . Three month discharge , follow-up assessment take place detect potential long-term effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After lesion central nervous system , many patient suffer diminished walking capability . During first rehabilitation phase , specific care help recovery motor function offer best chance return normal walk . For example , repeat practice walk exercise facilitate gain muscular strength stimulates motor relearning . However , patient , finish first rehabilitation phase , often observe strong limping , unsteady gait , bad management obstacle clearance . Thus , individual fall frequently , risk severe injury . The aim study assess efficacy gait training treadmill equip augment reality system . Shapes display onto treadmill belt projector ( beamer ) : patient adapts his/her gait draw unfolds front him/her . It possible train gait symmetry coordination enhancement exercise obstacle clearance gait agility . Another advantage type treadmill capability continuously analyze gait integrate sensor , hence , give real-time feedback patient . Whereas method seem promising , thorough study would confirm efficacy lack . Therefore , investigator seek conduct randomize control trial compare visually-guided gait train classical training method . During four week , participant train , accord ability , three five time week 30 minute augmented-reality treadmill . A group control patient train comparable intensity without visual guidance gait . Using data collect training session , investigator study whether evolution locomotor function differs group . Furthermore , several questionnaire fill participant document self-evaluation progress . In long term , investigator expect first improve efficacy gait rehabilitation second good understand recovery process locomotor function first month stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants fulfil follow inclusion criterion eligible study : Informed Consent document signature Stroke patient , patient traumatic brain injury , patient spinal cord injury acute subacute phase ( maximum 40 day incident ) Need gait rehabilitation reason least one follow condition : Paresis low extremity . Severe balance disorder . No walk entry due neurological injury Ability walk 2 minute without minimal aid , namely : With help one person , : With walk aid ( cane , walker ) The presence one follow exclusion criterion lead exclusion participant : Age &lt; 18 year Other clinically significant concomitant disease state ( e.g. , renal failure , hepatic dysfunction , cardiovascular disease , etc . ) may threaten health case sustain exercise . Concomitant gait disorder induce acute subacute musculoskeletal injury , e.g . fracture low extremity . Severe preexistent gait disorder deeply affect walk ability gait pattern , either due musculoskeletal ( e.g . severe osteoarthritis ) neurological ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease ) etiologies . Severe noncorrected visual impairment Inability follow procedure study , e.g . due language problem , psychological disorder , dementia , etc . participant .</criteria>
