	<detailed_description>Participants consent study request consent initial collection two vial blood ( ~ 20 ml total ) answer question regard aspect medical history lifestyle relevant cancer risk . Participants study also ask provide consent follow-up blood sample , confirmatory test show positive result , follow-up PET/CT scan investigation . 1,000 participant age 55 75 enrol BC Generations Project . This invite-only study . - Respondents provide consent choose enrol study direct online questionnaire ask answer question regard lifestyle medical history . - The consent form questionnaire result electronically receive UBC study site . - Once participant information receive UBC , enter password protect spreadsheet UBC server . At point , participant send requisition form direct one several possible blood collection site ( LifeLabs ) , two 10mL blood draw collect phlebotomist . Blood collection pay Boreal contract LifeLabs , perform Streck stabilize cfDNA blood collection tube ( capable store blood room temperature week ) . - Once collect , two blood tube deliver LifeLabs BC Cancer Research Center within 24-48 hr collection . The tube collect study staff ( within 5 day initial blood draw ) transport UBC , de-identified assigned random identifier ( UBC study number ) . Any personal identification tube completely remove , abrasion necessary . Identifying information enter password protect spreadsheet ( UBC server ) link participant information UBC study number . From point , blood sample , subsequent fraction result , identify study number . The de-identified tube transport Boreal Genomics separate plasma cellular fraction include erythrocyte buffy coat . The non-plasma component blood sample pool subsequently discard . The plasma fraction place separate tube frozen subsequent analysis . The original blood tube ( empty ) , destroy . - Frozen plasma sample , de-identified , deliver Pathway Genomics ( San Diego , CA ) DNA content analyze circulate tumor DNA assay employ UBC/Boreal Genomics enrichment technology . All participant ' plasma send Pathway , use assay . Any plasma consume assay destroy . No plasma , blood sample store either Pathway Genomics UBC , beyond temporary storage ( 1-2 week ) require perform assay . - Circulating tumor DNA assay result ( raw sequence data ) Pathway Genomics return UBC analyze presence cancer mutation . Any sample show activate mutation assay 's technical Limit Detection ( LOD ) call positive . One exception make TP53 mutation know exist normal individual low level . For mutation , level 0.1 % set , sample call positive . - Once data analyze , participant negative result send email thank participation inform negative result . - Participants whose sample provide positive result contact immediately telephone oncologist co-investigator concurrently send letter mail inform result ask return second blood draw . The investigator expect communication happen month original blood draw . The letter include contact information study team oncologist co-investigators , case participant question concern stage . A requisition form send letter . Two 10mL tube blood drawn blood collection visit , allow repeat test confirmation mutation present consistently . - Samples additional draw treat described initial sample , two exception . One , sample process Boreal Genomics instead ship Pathway Genomics . Two , buffy coat DNA ( germline DNA ) also test 96 cancer mutation present Boreal panel detect rare case circulate tumor DNA signal derives low level germline mutation instead tumor DNA . This test do Boreal Genomics remain buffy coat DNA consume test discard . Data circulate tumor DNA assay buffy coat test return UBC compare initial blood result . - Participants find cancer-associated germline mutation forego test informed oncologist co-investigators offer consultation Hereditary Cancer Program BC Cancer Agency meet medical geneticist consultation . If wish , participant would access clinically validate retesting germline mutation . - Participants additional blood sample yield positive result cancer mutation , contact telephone explain result . - Participants additional blood sample yield positive result cancer mutation see first blood draw contact telephone oncologist co-investigator , explain result next step . They also send letter . The investigator expect communication happen within week second blood draw . Pending oncological evaluation participant ( see ) study result , PET-CT scan fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) agent , possibly test request . Unless oncological exam suggest otherwise , default follow-up full body PET-CT . The participant undergo medical imaging scan give requisition form direct requested scan , pay study sponsor ( Boreal Genomics ) . - Recognizing advise abnormal DNA test may cause participant distress , investigator commit ( ) complete test contact participant result 2nd test within 14 day blood drawn ; ( b ) notification 2nd result ( abnormal normal ) do phone study oncologist ( c ) pre-booking follow-up oncological evaluation appointment offer participant two option phone advise 2nd abnormal result ( ) complete oncological evaluation within 3 week patient advise 2nd test abnormal . - The oncological evaluation perform Vancouver Centre BC Cancer Agency likely include : - A full history , include risk factor cancer review system seek symptom could cancer . - A physical examination : - Head neck , thorax , abdomen , skin , neurological system lymphatic system rectum . In men : prostate examination . In woman : breast gynecological examination - A whole-body PET-CT scan - Standard age-appropriate cancer screen investigation fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) colorectal cancer , Papanicolaou test cervix cancer mammography breast cancer , complete , due , overdue . - Additional investigation guide history , physical examination , whole-body PET-CT standard screen investigation . - Investigations may include : complete blood count , liver enzymes , tumour marker , urinalysis , contrast-enhanced MRI , contrast-enhanced CT , well endoscopy head neck , bronchus , bladder , upper GI tract lower GI tract . - Results test return oncologist investigator Dr. Marziali enter study database . The result communicate participant write well person phone . The oncologist refer participant additional test appropriate clinician follow additional investigation . The oncologist also offer referral participant supportive counseling stage . - The result communicate participant 's family physician , participant one , oncologist investigator . - Participants whose investigation detect potentially malignant mass biopsy , either image guidance , referral appropriate specialist . - Participants , whose investigation detect potentially malignant mass , inform writing , well person phone circulate tumor DNA test give false positive result advise continue appropriate cancer screen age family history . - Participants positive circulate tumor DNA result unwilling undergo test include possible PET-CTs still offer follow visit oncologist co-investigator discus result offer supportive counseling described . - A year follow initial blood draw , participant contact email determine cancer diagnosis make time . For non-responding participant , telephone family physician send letter inquire whether participant diagnose cancer . Data collect study provide BC Generations Project .</detailed_description>
