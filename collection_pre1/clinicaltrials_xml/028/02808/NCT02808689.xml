	<brief_title>Functional Medicine Asthma ( FAst ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional Medicine holistic approach treat chronic condition attempt address underlying cause chronic disease state . The purpose address whole person , set symptom . The patient care involve evaluate interaction among genetic , in-utero , lifetime environmental exposure . In addition , Functional Medicine specialist also aggressively address lifestyle factor nutrition exercise influence long-term health chronic disease . By , intention reduce ongoing biologic imbalance deficiency dietary oxidants/antioxidants via vitamin supplementation , hormonal imbalance evaluation management , need medication unwarranted side effect compound chronic medical condition adverse effect ( e.g . excess use antibiotic ) , systematically evaluate intolerance certain food additive . Collaborating Functional Medicine directly address Guideline focus control factor contribute symptom exacerbation well Cleveland Clinic care path initiative goal improve patient satisfaction collaborative healthcare team modify risk factor counsel environmental/lifestyle modification . This study look effectiveness add Functional Medicine approach patient asthma care . The investigator intention pilot study study subjective area medicine ( symptoms quality life ) objectively possible , order supplement asthma care guideline potential evidence asthma-related quality life , lung function/asthma control , biomarker-based reduction inflammation improvement immune status . Certainly value approach aspects valuable need determine two discipline integrate approach move forward benefit large population innovative scientifically proven way .</detailed_description>
