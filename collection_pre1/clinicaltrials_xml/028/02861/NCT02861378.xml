	<brief_summary>Dental procedure often require use local anesthesia . The effect anesthesia usually linger time dental procedure complete lead discomfort occasionally injury lip/tongue biting . Clinical trial show phentolamine mesylate ( OraVerse ) effective reduce amount time reversal local anesthesia compare sham injection . However , trial conduct compare phentolamine mesylate true control injection . Such trial need order definitively show phentolamine mesylate cause reduction anesthesia rather dilution effect . The objective propose research conduct pilot-scale randomized clinical trial evaluate difference time required return normal soft-tissue sensation function participant receive inferior alveolar nerve block ( use 2 % Lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine ) , follow injection either 1 ) OraVerse ( phentolamine mesylate ) 2 ) sterile physiological water ( control ) . The study population comprise dentistry dental hygiene student second year class Dalhousie University , Halifax , NS , Canada . This study population choose student usually practice dental anesthesia part course local anesthesia . This propose pilot scale study double-blind control trial use parallel group . As part usual anaesthesia course , dental dental hygiene student practice inferior alveolar nerve injection one another use 2 % Lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine . Students decide participate study randomly assign one two group : Group 1 receive injection OraVerse ( treatment group ) , Group 2 receive injection sterile physiological water ( control group ) . The time required return soft-tissue sensation function assess use questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research conduct Dalhousie University Dental Clinic . As part anaesthesia clinical course , student enrol second year dentistry dental hygiene program practice different anesthesia technique plan hands-on training activity . The research study take place day . Participants meet eligibility criterion consent participate randomly assign one two group . Following anesthesia obtain part hands-on training session , subject allocate Group 1 receive 1ml phentolamine mesylate follow anesthesia , subject allocate Group 2 receive 1ml sterile physiological water . Phase 1 , Both Groups : 1 . Subjects train use Assessment Anesthesia questionnaire 2 . Following training , subject perform baseline assessment lip tongue numbness ( normal ) . 3 . Prior anaesthesia give , vital sign record . Blood pressure , respiratory rate pulse record . 4 . Topical anesthetic , 20 % benzocaine , apply injection site 3 minute . Subjects give standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection , aspiration injection , use 1ml 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine student team . This step part study ; do part clinical anesthesia course . 5 . Soft tissue anaesthesia self-assessed , use finger tap palpation , ensure profound anesthesia . The second phase ( OraVerse water ) take place profound anesthesia achieve . The anesthetic outcome consider failure participant report anesthesia low lip within 10 minute . 6 . If profound anesthesia achieve within 10 minute , subject proceed phase 2 . If profound anesthesia achieve within 10 minute subject withdraw study . Subjects withdraw study continue standard training protocol receive re-injection anesthetic . A withdrawal form use Dr . Flood record occurrence anesthesia failure . This form also record reason withdrawal , occur different reason . Phase 2 Group 1 : Phentolamine Mesylate After anesthesia confirm , subject Group 1 receive injection 1ml solution contain 0.24mg phentolamine mesylate site previously inject anaesthetic solution . Dr. Brittany Flood give injection ensure consistency . Group 2 : Water After anesthesia confirm , subject Group 2 receive injection 1ml sterile physiological water site previously inject anesthetic solution . Dr. Brittany Flood give injection ensure consistency . Phase 3 Vital sign take immediately injection , student partner , student monitor 30 minute . During monitoring period , participant self-assess anesthesia , use Assessment Of Anesthesia questionnaire . This self-assessment do every ten minute soft-tissues revert normal state . After 30 minute monitoring period participant free leave clinic , take questionnaire continue check anesthesia every 10 minute tissue sensation function return normal . Students instructed return form office Research Development Officer . The Case Report Forms include follow : - Assessment Of Anesthesia questionnaire : self-assessment state soft-tissue anesthesia - Subject Eligibility Checklist : inclusion/exclusion criterion - Consent form - Participant Identification allocation Log ( centrally keep ) : Participant study ID chart number - Treatment Group Allocation Log ( centrally keep ) : Participant study ID treatment group ( ' A ' ' B ' ) - Withdrawal information - Adverse Event form Recruitment reversal injection do Dr. Brittany Flood , license dentist currently enrol student Masters Periodontics program Dalhousie University Faculty Dentistry . Dr. Pierre-Luc Michaud dentist full-time assistant professor Dalhousie Dentistry supervise project perform data analysis . He involve recruitment present clinical phase study . Dr. Brittany Flood position authority dental dental hygiene student therefore research member work directly participant . She research team member aware volunteer study . Two week anesthesia session , potential participant give thirty minute presentation , follow question answer session . On even anesthesia course session , initial numbness assessment ( 2 minute ) reversal injection ( 5 minute ) clinical time require participant study , manipulation ( vital sign monitor 30 minute post-injection waiting-time period leave ) standard part course . Following clinical portion , participant free leave clinic continue check anesthesia every 10 minute fill short questionnaire sensation function return normal ( record duration soft-tissue anesthesia ) . The duration anesthesia could take 1 2.5 hour , depend group participant . This study randomize double-blind study . The Research Development Officer Faculty Dentistry responsible randomization procedure . A computerized random number generator use generate six randomly permute block , block size six . Within block , equal number subject allocate two treatment group ( ' A ' ' B ' ) . These refer either OraVerse group Control group , Research Development Officer withhold information statistical analysis complete . She however give copy supervisor anesthesia training session ( involve study ) information inject could quickly access hands-on require appropriately fill participant ' clinical chart . The allocation place sequentially number ( 01 36 ) , opaque , seal envelope ( refer participant ' ID ) open time participant 's reversal injection . The treatment group ( A B ) randomly assign participant record Treatment Group Allocation Log . The syrinx mark ' A ' ' B ' ; person injecting ( Dr. Brittany Flood ) know contain OraVerse ( PM ) contain water . As previously discuss , anesthetic course supervisor however information safety measure appropriate fill patient ' chart . To ensure continuous blind allocation , randomization code keep secret Research Development Officer data analysis . Only participant study ID use label subject 's case report form . Only Participant Identification allocation Log could associate participant ID patient ' chart number , file keep centrally study time .</detailed_description>
