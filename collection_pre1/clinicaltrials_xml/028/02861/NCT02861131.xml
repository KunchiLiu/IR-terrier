	<brief_title>The Effect Sugammadex Versus Neostigmine Postoperative Pulmonary Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design assessor-blinded , randomize , control , single center , parallel design trial Oregon Health Science University ( OHSU ) Portland , Oregon . The investigator enroll patient ≥ 70 year age mentally competent consent anesthesia schedule surgical length ≥ 180 minute Monday Friday South Operating Room Theatre Oregon Health Science University . Subjects screen inclusion study either day prior day surgery . The initial review occur quick view surgical posting sheet South Operating Rooms . Subjects undergo type surgery eligible long neuromuscular paralysis component plan anesthetic . If subject initially seem appropriate inclusion , depth chart review occur . The research coordinator approach patient meet inclusion criterion Pre-operative Care Unit . Initially patient 70 year age old equal probability approach study . At halfway point study investigator monitor enrollment , ahead schedule , preferentially select old patient 2nd half study—a group likely Postoperative Pulmonary Complications ( PPCs ) . All subject approach recruitment hear description study , reason pursue research question , option opt research protocol complete data collection , potential risk , advantage , disadvantage participate . Subjects agree participate study ask sign write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board . All subject agree participate research study give form describe research study provide contact information principal investigator . The subject 's status research project show clearly medical record problem list , subject 's time participation complete . A progress note place subject 's chart allow provider easily contact study investigator . In addition , electronic copy sign consent scan medical record system copy sign consent make available subject take home . All subject enrol follow characteristic record research coordinator : age , sex , weight , body mass index , American Society Anesthesiologists physical status classification score , creatinine clearance , Charlson comorbidity index . Subjects allocate either neuromuscular reversal sugammadex neostigmine . Before study activation sample 200 sequentially numbered opaque envelope prepare investigator involve patient recruitment , allocation , consent , assessment : 100 sugammadex arm 100 neostigmine arm . Patient allocation occur operating room anesthesia provider notifies coordinator reversal appropriate . At time research coordinator open low remain numbered free envelope . Group assignment determine computer generate random number sequence produce Excel ( Redmond , Washington ) . The random number sequence generate investigator involve either patient enrollment patient assignment . Reversal rocuronium neuromuscular blockade ( i.e . sugammadex neostigmine ) define open opaque envelope . Once study subject sign consent form , unique number corresponding open opaque envelope assign subject . The envelope open anesthesia provider ready prepare administer reversal neuromuscular blockade . This subject number never reuse remain subject entirety study . No subject ever allow one unique subject number . The subject , anesthesia provider , research coordinator perform consent recruitment blind study drug . The anesthesiologist blind reason patient safety . The assessor PPCs , residual neuromuscular blockade , secondary outcome , exploratory outcome , adverse event accounting blind study drug allow operating room surgery . All subject standard American Society Anesthesiologists monitor plus five lead electrocardiogram apply . Additional monitoring need leave anesthesia team direct patient care . Decisions regard induction maintenance anesthesia also leave direction anesthesia team exception rocuronium mandate maintenance neuromuscular blockade . Decisions dose quantity rocuronium dose maintenance neuromuscular blockade leave discretion anesthesia team operating room . The level neuromuscular blockade monitor operating room adductor pollicis muscle basic peripheral nerve stimulator monitor train-of-four ratio capability . Train-of-four count mandate every 15 minute , current practice OHSU . Anesthesia provider ask maintain neuromuscular blockade T2 level throughout surgery reverse neuromuscular blockade close T2 level safely possible . Administration sugammadex neostigmine occur fast flow IV run wide open . Sugammadex dose 2 mg/kg neostigmine dose 0.07 mg/kg maximum 5 mg. Glycopyrrolate co-administered neostigmine arm dose 0.1 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate per 1.0 mg neostigmine administer . In accordance standard practice OHSU , subject convective warmer use case subject temperature monitor . Ventilation parameter leave discretion anesthesia team operating room . A train-of-four ratio obtain subject within 5 minute arrival Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) Train-of-four Watch-SX Acceleromyograph . In order measure train-of-four ratio PACU train-of-four watch set calibrate subject upon arrival OR , prior administration neuromuscular block agent . The accelerometer sensor attach subject 's thumb . The subject 's finger forearm adjacent thumb attach accelerometer sensor fix tape arm board minimize artifact . Ulnar nerve stimulation adductor pollicis muscle measure via Train-of-four watch . As twitch height vary subject subject , control twitch height value 100 % 1 Hz mode calibrate 5 second , 50 Hz tetanic stimulation . This calibration use obtain train-of-four ratio upon 5 minute arrival PACU . A train-of-four ratio le 0.9 consider residual neuromuscular blockade . Active monitoring adverse event ( desaturation , hypoxemia , upper airway obstruction , aspiration pneumonitis , bronchospasm , laryngospasm , drug hypersensitivity reaction , recurarization ) conduct ongoing basis discharge daily assessment research coordinator and/or principal investigator . Assessment PACU phase 1 recovery time occur Post-operative day ( POD ) # 0 POD # 1 . Assessment hospital length stay assess within week discharge electronic medical record review . Hospital readmission data assess within 1 2 month hospital discharge . National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( NSQIP ) 30-day postoperative risk-adjusted respiratory complication assess record prior data analysis conclusion patient enrollment study implementation .</detailed_description>
