	<brief_summary>The main purpose investigational research study determine safe tolerable study drug volasertib combination liposomal vincristine ( Marqibo ; FDA-approved drug ) patient relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia . While VSLI demonstrate overall response rate 35 % Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) patient fail respond relapse chemotherapy , combine agent may increase clinical benefit . Volasertib inhibit protein involve cell cycle increase ALL . When volasertib inhibits proteins ALL cell die . In laboratory , volasertib show increase activity vincristine ALL cell . Therefore , think combination volasertib VSLI effective leukemia either drug use alone . This study try find effect , good and/or bad , drug combination patient cancer , find dose may use future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volasertib Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination volasertib vincristine sulfate liposomal injection ( VSLI ) relapsed/refractory ( RR ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile volasertib VSLI , rate complete remission ( without complete hematologic recovery ; complete response [ CR ] /CR incomplete hematologic recovery [ CRi ] ) , duration remission ( DOR ) , rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negativity , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , 30-day mortality rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine volasertib polo-like kinase ( plk ) -inhibition down-regulates mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway . II . Whether plk mTOR inhibition correlate clinical response treatment . III . determine volasertib act synergistically potentiate bioavailability distribution VSLI . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study volasertib . Patients receive volasertib intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 vincristine sulfate liposome IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression , development inter-current illness prevents administration treatment , unacceptable toxicity , patient decides withdraw treat investigator determines patient take treatment reason . After completion study , patient follow every 28 day 1 year .</detailed_description>
