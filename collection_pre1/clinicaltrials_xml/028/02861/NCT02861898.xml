	<brief_summary>Primary brain cancer kill 10,000 Americans year . These brain tumor typically treat surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy , either individually combination . Present therapy inadequate , evidence low 5-year survival rate brain cancer patient , median survival approximately 12 month . Glioma common form primary brain cancer , afflict approximately 7,000 patient United States year . These highly malignant cancer remain significant unmet clinical need oncology . GBM often high expression EFGR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) block Cetuximab ( CTX ) . The investigator recently complete separate Phase I clinical trial use superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion ( SIACI ) CTX blood brain barrier disruption ( BBBD ) recurrent GBM ( Chakraborty et al , revision , Journal Neurooncology ) . The investigator find intra-arterial infusion CTX well tolerate adverse effect . The investigator hypothesize patient newly diagnose GBM , repeat SIACI drug BBBD safe efficacious patient combine standard chemoradiation ( STUPP protocol ) . This trial non-randomized open label Phase I/II clinical trial . In addition standard chemotherapy radiation therapy ( STUPP protocol ) patient give CTX intra-arterially BBBD total three dos approximately post surgery day 30 , 120 210 .</brief_summary>
