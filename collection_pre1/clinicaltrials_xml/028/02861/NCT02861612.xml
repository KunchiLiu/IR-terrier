	<brief_title>Nerve Transfers Restore Hand Function Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical spinal cord injury life‐altering injury result profound loss upper limb function . Hand function essential basic activity daily live consequently significant impact patient ' quality life . Tendon transfer and/or tenodesis traditionally use restore hand function spinal cord injuries - however , recent year grow interest role nerve transfer mean accomplish goal . Although preliminary result indicate nerve transfer may well‐suited patient spinal cord injury , long term efficacy demonstrate . This study seek evaluate efficacy nerve transfer restore hand function patient cervical spinal injury . Eligible patient receive nerve transfer procedure ( ) ( e.g . brachialis anterior interosseous nerve , supinator posterior interosseous ) follow post-operatively ass change strength , functional independence , quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients spinal cord injury AIS level C5 C7 . Those motor complete injury ( AIS A B ) consider surgical intervention ≥ 5 month post injury . Motor incomplete patient ( AIS C D ) consider ≥ 1.5 year post injury . Patients require ≥ MRC 4 strength muscle supply donor nerve ( e.g . brachialis , supinator ) . Finger flexor extensor strength ≤ MRC 1 strength . Muscles supply donor nerve , need minimal evidence lower motor neuron injury dictate evidence fibrillation , positive sharp wave , moderate severely decreased recruitment needle electromyography . Those evaluate surgery outside ninemonths post injury recipient muscle require free low motor neuron pathology . Ability comply participate rigorous postsurgical therapy regimen . Comorbidities preclude safe surgery include autonomic/hemodynamic instability , pulmonary instability , active infection , chronic pressure sore untreated urinary tract infection determine physician . Simultaneous tendon transfer tenodesis surgery ( would preclude separation effect nerve transfer alone ) .</criteria>
