	<brief_summary>The propose study humeral shaft fracture adult examine outcomes patient treat Humeral Trauma Nail System treat displace humeral shaft fracture ( displace OTA code 12A , B , C ) , nonunions , malunions . The device study use internal gear system control wirelessly rare earth magnet , typically offer distraction lengthening . In humerus however , treatment acute fracture , percutaneously insert nail also offer compression healing process , thereby negate effect gravity , may turn lead faster consistent rate union . Furthermore , case slower heal dynamic property nail may employ `` accordion technique '' ( alternate compression-distraction , feature unique implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary end point union rate without secondary procedure . The hypothesis compression distraction device make possible , investigator achieve high union rate form treatment , use percutaneous approach , decrease complication rate , dynamically modulate heal response need . The primary safety endpoint occurrence adverse event time treatment . During heal process external remote controller ( ERC ) use continually compress distract fracture need . The surgeon monitor heal decide , clinically base sequential radiograph subsequent office visit , whether fracture need additional compression distraction , accordion technique , additional external manipulation via ERC . Participants follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
