	<brief_summary>Moving one 's joint full range motion ( ROM ) crucial health wellbeing . Those unable difficulty carry simple activity like walk feed . Lost joint ROM call contracture . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common form arthritis . About third people knee OA develop knee flexion contracture ( KFlCs ) , inability fully straighten knee . Having KFlC knee replacement big risk factor redevelop one operation . Many people KFlC knee surgery also KFlC knee . The investigator believe non-surgical KFlC increase risk re-developing KFlC surgical knee surgery encourage bend surgical knee avoid one leg shorter . No one ever look whether fix leg length difference use shoe lift would prevent problem little information help design study . Here investigator see test shoe lift use prevent KFlC feasible . The investigator hypothesis study evaluate benefit use shoe lift correct leg length difference non-surgical knee feasible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Recurrent Knee Flexion Contracture Correcting Leg Length Discrepancy After Total Knee Arthroplasty OA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Joint contracture characterize restriction full passive range motion ( ROM ) joint major burden public health . They restrict mobility , negative impact quality life , limit individual 's productivity earn potential , prevent basic activity daily live dress eat . The geriatric population particularly vulnerable contracture due accumulate comorbidities lead restrict joint movement permanent loss ROM . A knee flexion contracture ( KFlC ) limitation knee extension . Patients KFlCs limp afflict constant enhance energy demand quadriceps muscle , put high risk fall injury . Walking slow abnormally tire KFlC patient may choose walk less . Murphy et al . identify significant increase energy cost walk KFlC ≥15° . In addition , KFlCs cause functional shortening affect limb result leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) . LLDs contribute even great energy requirement ambulation , bad pain due premature joint wear , associate knee osteoarthritis progression . One study identify shoe modification mean correct treatable risk factor . To investigator ' knowledge , study examine effect shoe modification KFlC . Contractures associate many condition include arthritis . In set osteoarthritis ( OA ) , common arthritis world-leading cause disability elderly , contractures highly prevalent : one third 3,400 patient OA present total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) KFlC . The burden KFlC OA compound pre-operative contracture put patient high risk contracture , knee pain poor outcome post-operatively . Loss pre-operative ROM find best predictor lose post-operative ROM . During TKA , surgeon often able restore knee ROM transiently eliminate contracture immediate post-operative period . Unfortunately , full ROM lose time notable proportion patient . The overall incidence KFlC follow TKA report 1 5 % . In patient pre-operative KFlC , report high 15 % result post-operative KFlCs still present 3-year follow-up4 . Patients develop post-operative KFlC report less satisfaction , poor function pain post-surgically . Post-operative loss ROM describe one common cause readmission within first 90 day surgery identify primary reason nearly 20 % revision TKAs . These large percentage represent significant number consider 719,000 replacement perform USA 2010 Ottawa hospital alone perform 500 TKAs per year . KFlCs therefore contribute increase health care cost . Treatment KFlC include aggressive physiotherapy , therapeutic modality , continuous passive ROM device , bracing , manipulation anesthesia , arthroscopy , open arthrolysis , TKA revision surgery . Despite numerous costly option however , treatment often unrewarding . Overall , contractures draw heavily health care resource chronic nature poor response treatment . In previous study , investigator ' group examine factor associate KFlC patient end-stage OA go TKA . By compare contracture without , investigator find KFlC knee schedule TKA ( surgical knee ) associate KFlC ( non-surgical ) knee1 . Once surgical KFlC correct intra-operatively , patient would suffer functionally short limb unoperated side . Given disadvantage walk limbs unequal length , patient may inadvertently flex surgical knee walk order equalize limb length . By access full range extension surgical knee , could , time , result re-development KFlC surgical knee . In study investigator propose correct LLD use shoe lift unoperated knee KFlC . The investigator believe reduce likelihood re-developing KFlC TKA surgical knee . This simple , relatively inexpensive , intervention could reduce post-surgical morbidity , TKA revision rate long-term cost healthcare system . Unfortunately , little data literature outline benefit shoe lifts post-operatively . Innovation : The investigator use simple inexpensive intervention ( shoe lift ) correct leg length shorten non-surgical limb patient OA bilateral knee flexion contractures unilateral total knee replacement . Objective : Determining feasibility study effect shoe lift treatment post-arthroplasty range motion surgical knee patient bilateral pre-operative knee flexion contractures Rationale : Post-operative KFlCs cause pain , reduce function patient satisfaction . They common cause chronic disability costly difficult treat . Prevention post-operative KFlC would therefore beneficial patient health care system . The investigator believe provide shoe lift non-surgical knee reduce incidence develop post-operative KFlC surgical knee patient pre-operative KFlC . To investigator knowledge , presently insufficient data literature upon design study test hypothesis , either term power analysis outcome measure . By complete Objective investigator accomplish 3 goal : ( 1 ) determine data variance power analysis future study , ( 2 ) determine either two validate pain functional outcome measure sensitive difference knee ROM , ( 3 ) determine number subject investigator able recruit within timeframe study . In Objective , investigator recruit subject randomly allocate 1 2 group , 1° knee OA bilateral KFlCs schedule TKA : Group 1 : Leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) 2° KFlC non-operated limb correct use shoe lift TKA . Group 2 : `` Sham '' shoe modification correct LLD non-surgical limb TKA . Hypothesis : It feasible design large randomize control trial evaluate pain functional outcome benefit use shoe lift non-surgical knee post-operatively patient OA bilateral pre-operative KFlCs . These benefit detect use validated OA outcome tool . During post-operative inpatient stay , participant anatomic leg length measure ( ASIS medial malleolus ) refer fitted appropriate shoe adjustment .</detailed_description>
