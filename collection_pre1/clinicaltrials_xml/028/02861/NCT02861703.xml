Obesity serious psychological physical implication pre- post-menopausal BC survivor ; addition compromise body image QoL , increase risk recurrence mortality . Specifically , increase fat result great production estrogen , insulin , leptin pro-inflammatory cytokine , less production sex hormone bind globulin , link promotion BC tumor growth . As , development strategy promotion maintenance optimal body mass become primary focus BC survivorship . Trials lifestyle intervention population early stage primarily include modification diet alone , exercise alone , .

However , despite indication diet exercise intervention lead improvement physical health mental health , remain lack consistent evidence gain maintain long-term . As , need systematic follow-up intervention determine potential produce endure effect well development refinement technique improve long-term weight management . Beyond develop effective service , direction future research include outreach underserved population .
