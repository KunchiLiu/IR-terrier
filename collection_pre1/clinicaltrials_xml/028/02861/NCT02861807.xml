	<brief_summary>Alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) impact million Americans associate significant behavioral , social , economic , medical , neurobiological dysfunction , yet current behavioral treatment AUD modestly effective . The propose research test efficacy novel behavioral intervention , combine brain stimulation mindfulness-based relapse prevention , hypothesize improve neural dysfunction ultimately lead large effect size reduction heavy drinking among individual AUD . Given mindfulness brain stimulation already available `` home use '' great potential ultimate dissemination intervention large scale , could significant impact public health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Intervention Transcranial Direct Current Brain Stimulation Reduce Heavy Drinking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heavy drinking ( defined 4+/5+ drink per occasion women/men ) alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) significant public health problem . Modestly effective pharmacological psychosocial treatment AUD exist , yet heavy drinking ( i.e. , relapse ) common outcome follow AUD treatment . Continued development innovative efficacious intervention reduce heavy drinking specifically target risk factor heavy drinking thus clearly warrant . One novel intervention considerable promise reduce heavy drinking mindfulness-based relapse prevention ( MBRP ) . MBRP behavioral intervention substance use disorder design target experience crave risk factor heavy drinking . Based result numerous study , MBRP feasible efficacious treatment AUD . However effect size MBRP remain small many individual struggle engage mindfulness practice early treatment . There preliminary evidence combine non-invasive form brain stimulation , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , may improve engagement mindfulness practice lead significant reduction heavy drinking follow treatment . The goal propose study examine efficacy mindfulness + tDCS intervention reduce heavy drinking impact hypothesize mechanisms behavior change among individual AUD interest reduce heavy drinking . In proposed study , research team complementary expertise AUD treatment , mindfulness-based intervention , brain stimulation , cognitive neuroscience combine self-report , behavioral , neurophysiological data collection via electroencephalography ( EEG ) study psychological neurophysiological mechanism treatment efficacy follow novel , promise intervention combine brain stimulation mindfulness training . The mindfulness base intervention combination active tDCS hypothesize lead significant reduction drink per drinking day 8 week treatment reduction maintain 2 month follow treatment . Further , effect active tDCS drink per drinking day 2 month follow-up mediate great mindfulness , great inhibitory control reduction crave negative affect treatment post-treatment assessment . Approximately 86 individual meet criterion AUD randomly assign 8 session either MBRP combine active tDCS ( 2.0 milliamp current ) MBRP combine sham tDCS ( current ) control condition . The propose study examine efficacy ( Primary Aim ) psychological neurophysiological mechanism treatment efficacy use behavioral measure EEG ( Secondary Aim ) . In addition address question whether add active tDCS MBRP enhance efficacy , examine issue neurophysiological behavioral treatment mechanism well inform design future large efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
