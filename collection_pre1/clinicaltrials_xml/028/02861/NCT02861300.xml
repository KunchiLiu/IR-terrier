	<brief_summary>This study two portion . The main goal Phase I portion research study see dose CB-839 capecitabine safely give patient without many side effect . Other purpose research study determine side effect see combination medicine . The Phase II portion study test many patient show shrinkage tumor combination medicine change occur inside cancer cell blood cell treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CB-839 + Capecitabine Solid Tumors Fluoropyrimidine Resistant PIK3CA Mutant Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Primary Objective : To determine safety , tolerability recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination CB-839 capecitabine chemotherapy patient advance solid tumor remain treatment option capecitabine acceptable therapy . Phase II Primary Objective : To determine response rate combination CB-839 capecitabine chemotherapy patient metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer refractory fluoropyrimidine therapy . Phase I Secondary Objectives : To determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose combination therapy CB-839 capecitabine patient advance solid tumor remain treatment option single agent capecitabine acceptable therapy . To determine antitumor response assess RECIST criterion combination therapy CB-839 capecitabine patient advance solid tumor remain treatment option single agent capecitabine acceptable therapy . Phase II Secondary Objectives : To determine progression free survival follow treatment CB-839 capecitabine chemotherapy patient metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer refractory fluoropyrimidine therapy . To determine overall survival follow treatment CB-839 capecitabine chemotherapy patient metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer refractory fluoropyrimidine therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I Patients must advance solid tumor remain treatment option colorectal patient progress frontline fluoropyrimidine contain therapy . Patients colorectal cancer must progress least one line fluoropyrimidine contain therapy . Receipt either oxaliplatin irinotecan combination fluoropyrimidine require front line set colorectal cancer patient unless either agent otherwise contraindicate opinion treat physician . Prior regorafenib TAS102 therapy require . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5mg/dL Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Patients must able swallow pill . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day prior first dose study drug agree use dual method contraception study minimum 3 month follow last dose study drug . Postmenopausal female ( &gt; 45 year old without menses &gt; 1 year ) surgically sterilize female exempt requirement . Male patient must use effective barrier method contraception study minimum 3 month follow last dose study drug sexually active female childbearing potential . Phase II Patients must histologically cytologically confirm , phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate 3kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutant metastatic colorectal cancer . PIK3CA status must confirm tumor sequence CLIA certify lab . Patients must measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion amenable biopsy willing undergo pre posttreatment tumor biopsy . Lesions biopsied used measurement . Patients must receive progressed fluoropyrimidine fluoropyrimidine base therapy . Receipt either oxaliplatin irinotecan combination fluoropyrimidine require front line set unless either agent otherwise contraindicate opinion treat physician case fluoropyrimidine may use . Prior regorafenib TAS102 therapy require . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcL Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Patients must able swallow pill . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day prior first dose study drug agree use dual method contraception study minimum 3 month follow last dose study drug . Postmenopausal female ( &gt; 45 year old without menses &gt; 1 year ) surgically sterilize female exempt requirement . Male patient must use effective barrier method contraception study minimum 3 month follow last dose study drug sexually active female childbearing potential . Both Phase I Phase II Patients ongoing toxicity &gt; grade 1 accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.0 ( exclude alopecia ) due prior anticancer therapy . Patients receive investigational agent receive recent treatment colorectal cancer ( radiation within previous two week , chemotherapy investigational therapy within previous four week ) . Patients untreated brain metastases/central nervous system disease exclude due poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history allergic reaction attribute intolerance compound similar chemical biologic composition either CB839 capecitabine . If capecitabine receive previously , must tolerate least equivalent dose dose administer assign dose level . Patients unable swallow pill undergone surgery prohibit absorption pill stomach . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris myocardial infarction within prior 6 month , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients pregnant breastfeed exclude study . Patients know HIV positive receive antiretroviral therapy exclude due marrow suppressive therapy involve administration study treatment .</criteria>
