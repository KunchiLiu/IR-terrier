	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) combination therapy patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . There three cohort study 70 participant enrol cohort : Cohort A receive pembrolizumab + olaparib , Cohort B receive pembrolizumab + docetaxel + prednisone , Cohort C receive pembrolizumab + enzalutamide . Outcome measure assess individually cohort .</brief_summary>
