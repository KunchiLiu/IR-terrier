	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Demonstrates understand study procedure , restriction willingness participate evidenced voluntary write informed consent receive sign date copy inform consent form Aged 18 65 year inclusive Understands willing , able likely comply study procedure restriction . Good general mental health , opinion investigator medically qualify designee : No clinically significant relevant abnormality medical history upon oral examination absence condition would impact participant 's safety well affect individual 's ability understand follow study procedures requirement . At Screening Selfreported history dentinal hypersensitivity ( DH ) last six month 10 year . Good general oral health , minimum 20 natural teeth . Minimum 2 accessible nonadjacent teeth ( incisor , canine , premolar ) , preferably different quadrant , meet following criterion ; sign facial/cervical gingival recession and/or sign erosion abrasion ( EAR ) , tooth MGI score =0 adjacent test area ( exposed dentine ) clinical mobility ≤1 tooth sign sensitivity measure qualify evaporative air assessment ( Schiff sensitivity score ≥1 ) . At Baseline ( Visit 2 ) Minimum two , nonadjacent accessible teeth ( incisor , canine , premolar ) , meet follow criterion i.e . Tooth sign sensitivity , measure response qualify tactile stimulus ( Yeaple ≤ 20g ) evaporative air assessment ( Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2 ) . Exclusion Criteria Women know pregnant intend become pregnant duration study . Women breastfeed . Known suspected intolerance hypersensitivity study material ( closely relate compound ) state ingredient . Participation another clinical study ( include cosmetic study ) receipt investigational drug within 30 day screen visit , previous participation study participation another tooth desensitize treatment study within 8 week screen visit . Recent history ( within last year ) alcohol substance abuse . An employee sponsor study site member immediate family . Presence chronic debilitating disease , opinion investigator , could affect study outcome , presence condition , opinion investigator cause xerostomia . Dental prophylaxis within 4 week Screening , tongue lip pierce presence dental implant gross periodontal disease , treatment periodontal disease ( include surgery ) within 12 month Screening , scale root planning within 3 month Screening . Teeth bleach within 8 week Screening . Desensitising treatment within 8 week screen ( professional sensitivity treatment nondentifrice sensitivity treatment ) . Specific Dentition Exclusions For Test Teeth ) Tooth evidence current recent caries , report treatment decay within 12 month Screening b ) Tooth expose dentine deep , defective facial restoration , teeth use abutment fix removable partial denture , teeth full crown veneer , orthodontic band crack enamel . Sensitive teeth contribute aetiology erosion , abrasion recession expose dentine . C ) Sensitive tooth expect respond treatment overthecounter dentifrice opinion investigator . Use oral care product indicated relief dentine hypersensitivity within 8 week screen ( Participants require bring current oral care product site order verify absence know antisensitivity ingredient ) . Any subject , judgment investigator , participate study , condition opinion investigator would impact subject 's safety wellbeing affect individual 's ability understand follow study procedures requirement . Daily dose medication/treatments traditional herbal ingredients/treatments , opinion investigator , could interfere perception pain ( Examples medication include analgesic , anticonvulsant , antihistamine cause mark moderate sedation , sedative , tranquilisers , antidepressant , moodaltering antiinflammatory drug examples herbal ingredients/treatments include clove oil , olive oil , treatment directly apply oral cavity treatment oral health condition ) . Currently take antibiotic take antibiotic within 2 week Baseline . Daily dose medication , opinion investigator , cause xerostomia . Individuals require antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedure .</criteria>
