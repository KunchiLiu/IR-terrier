	<brief_title>Phase II Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Chikungunya Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , block-randomized , active- placebo control , phase II trial , compare two dose level assess immunogenicity , safety tolerability MV-CHIK ( novel vaccine Chikungunya virus ) . Healthy male female subject age 18-55 year randomize one six treatment group ( A , B , C. D , M1 M2 ) differ dosage schedule vaccination . Group A-D split one arm receive MV-CHIK one control-arm receiving Priorix® . All subject group A . B , C D receive three i.m . injection study day 0 , 28 196 . Subjects group A B receive MV-CHIK low dose control-vaccine Priorix® ( equivalent measles vaccine ) subject group C D treat MV-CHIK high dose control-vaccine ( Priorix® equivalent measles vaccine ) . All subject group A , B , C D additionally randomize one two treatment sequence : group A C receive MV-CHIK control-vaccine Priorix® study day 0 28 , follow placebo day 196 , group B D receive placebo day 0 MV-CHIK Priorix® day 28 , follow additional vaccination product day196 ( boost vaccination ) . All subject measles booster group M1 M2 receive five i.m . injection study day -28 , 0 , 28 , 168 196 . The first vaccination Priorix® ( equivalent measles vaccine ) study day -28 . Group M1 receive MV-CHIK low dose vaccination day 0 day 28 placebo day 168 196 . Group M2 receive placebo day 0 28 MV-CHIK low dose day 168 day 196 . All subject follow safety immunogenicity evaluation day 224 . Study duration per subject estimate 33-37 week ( ~8 month ) , respectively .</detailed_description>
