	<brief_summary>The goal propose research test feasibility functional progression program reduce cost possible radiation exposure adolescent athlete low back pain . Specifically investigator plan test feasibility use progression rehabilitation pragmatically differentially diagnose treat adolescent athlete low back pain , instead use advanced imaging current practice . The investigator propose recruit 20 participant , 10 usual care ( advanced imaging ) 10 propose intervention ( functional progression ) ass feasibility use functional progress guide treatment . The outcome measure number day rest , time start regular rehabilitation , pain experience , functional outcome , ability return sport , time need return sport .

	<brief_title>Feasibility Using Functional Progression Guide Treatment Adolescent Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) common complaint adolescent athlete , rate report high 50 % mid-teen year . Although low back pain adolescent athlete may result several different pathology , spondylolysis -- fracture par interarticularis -- common cause demographic , prevalence high 47 % . The recommended treatment spondylolysis non-specific mechanical LBP quite different . Patients mechanical LBP recommend stay active , perform rehabilitation necessary , primary treatment spondylolysis rest 3 month , physical therapy bracing need . With diagnosis spondylolysis fairly common young athlete low back pain , physician need high index suspicion make diagnosis . Advanced image often necessary confidently rule diagnosis spondylolysis . Advanced imaging increase diagnostic accuracy , add cost potentially considerable radiation exposure . However , advance imaging may necessary effectively treat adolescent low back pain . Function , imaging , use determine patient heal spondylolytic injury . In fact , result heal image association clinical outcome . Most defect heal non-operative treatment suggest successful clinical outcome depend heal lesion . The functional progress patient make markedly different patient mechanical LBP patient spondylolysis . The majority adolescents mechanical LBP make full functional recovery short period rehabilitation . A patient spondylolytic injury may demonstrate inability make full return activity rehabilitation require period rest sport high level activity make full functional recovery . Due difference progression mechanical LBP spondylolysis , functional progress could use differentially diagnose condition . If effective , use functional progress instead advance image would cost-effective expose patient significantly less radiation . In retrospective review adolescent patient present investigator sport medicine clinic LBP , 80 % advance imaging performed due concern spondylolysis . Thirty-two percent patient positive spondylolysis advance imaging , 11 % patient multiple advance imaging perform due lack progress . No significant finding note advanced imaging . By use functional progress determine course care , use advanced imaging patient respond conservative care , potential significantly reduce need advanced imaging . The primary risk use functional progress physical therapy ( PT ) instead advance imaging determine course care adolescent LBP delay diagnosis fail respond conservative care . The risk miss sinister pathology mimic LBP minimize thorough clinical evaluation radiograph warrant . The result investigator ' previous work demonstrate early PT care patient spondylolytic injury safe reduces time return sport . In retrospective review cross-sectional follow-up , patient acute spondylolysis begin physical therapy soon 4 week ( mean 2 month ) make quicker functional recovery back activity similar clinical outcome 1-5 year follow-ups . A delayed diagnosis negatively impact long-term functional outcome patient spondylolysis duration symptom find associated outcome . Using logistic regression dataset determine factor associate good short long-term clinical outcome , duration symtpoms time diagnosis find impact outcomes . On hand , delay PT care obtain advanced imaging find negatively impact outcome patient mechanical LBP . This project lay groundwork demonstrate feasibility functional progression treat adolescent athletes LBP . If successful , additional study propose test effectiveness intervention ( functional progression ) compare usual care ( image ) improve recovery outcome LBP . Ultimately , research would lead change way adolescent athlete LBP treat , result decrease cost , decrease exposure radiation , decreased time begin rehabilitation . The result work would positively impact patient , clinician , decrease cost health care system . Control Cohort A series 10 individual meet inclusion criterion patient sport medicine physician ( Dr.s James MacDonald , Ravindran ) , physician recruit patient experimental cohort still co-investigators , serve non-randomized control cohort typical clinical care outcome . Description functional progression guide treatment protocol . ( Figure 1 ) Patients evaluated physician determine appropriateness participation study . Patients meet inclusion criterion consent participate pilot study part experimental cohort advance image do refer directly PT care 2 time per week 3 week . The functional progression protocol perform physical therapist train treatment progression protocol . Patients perform phase I PT protocol progress phase II able without increase pain sufficiently proper mechanic . ( Table 1 ) Patients assessed session determine meet criterion begin next step functional PT progression back sport . ( Table 2 ) Those patient meet criterion within designate 3 week period progress next phase functional PT return sport activity additional 2 week PT . If patient progress well third phase , able meet return sport criterion , discharge PT monitor phone recurrence symptom 2 month . ( Table 3 ) Those patient progress phase I II functionally without pain brace , determine physician , placed rest activity except ADL 's PT home exercise program treat patient presumed spondylolysis . Additionally , patient unable meet return sport criterion within 5 week PT brace , deem necessary physician , place rest activity except ADL 's PT home exercise program treat presumed spondylolysis . These patient follow care appropriate condition . They rest sport &gt; 2 month initial evaluation , brace necessary , ultimately complete 4 week PT care progress able back sport activity . Patients treat presumed spondylolysis return sport 3 month rest period rest find produce optimal result . ( El Rassi et al. , 2013 ) Patients monthly re-evaluations physician discharge . If point patient respond expected physician concern patient 's safety , physician take appropriate step feel necessary safety patient . Patients classify non-responders progress expect typical course mechanical LBP spondylolysis . Specific Outcome Variables 1 . Advanced imaging use episode care : Computed tomography ( CT ) , single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 2 . Total cost calculate billed cost physician visit , physical therapy visit , radiograph , advance imaging , prescribed brace , prescribed medication . 3 . Total number PT visit calculate number physical therapy visit complete LBP episode care . 4 . The number day physician initially evaluate patient place hold sport activity patient clear return sport . 5. , Clinical outcome : Modified Odom 's Criteria , Micheli Functional Scale . Ability return sport This pilot study randomize . All patient consent participate treat accord treatment approach co-investigating physician agree perform . Blinding No blinding perform pilot trial feasible blind either clinicians patient treatment cohort . Data Analysis Descriptive statistic patient demographic outcome variable report . The two treatment group compare base cost , image usage , outcomes perform statistical analysis due small sample size . Treatment receive Patient Characteristics ( eg gender , age ) Injury characteristic ( eg duration symptom , type symptom Number patient utilize advanced imaging . Total cost episode care LBP Total number PT visit . Number day return sport activity Clinical outcome ( eg pain , function , patient perceive improvement )</detailed_description>
