	<detailed_description>Many study show positive impact clinical pharmacy service clinical , economic humanistic outcome . This type service may highly important save life , improve patient outcome , decrease treatment cost particularly resource-limited setting like Ethiopia double burden communicable non-communicable disease need medication therapy . Though patient may experience number problem related drug therapy , study conduct Ethiopia show impact clinical pharmacy service alleviate treatment relate problem . Therefore , study aim answer follow research question . impact clinical pharmacy service improve patient outcome reduce cost treatment chronic illness patient impact clinical pharmacy service improve patient outcome reduce cost treatment hospitalize patient Study site location participant : randomize control trial conduct Jimma University Specialized Hospital , Southwest Ethiopia . Sample size calculation The sample size inpatient calculate use Open Epi online sample size calculator software follow assumption : With 80 % power significance level 0.05 95 % confidence interval . Two tail test 1:1 ratio intervention group control group . The investigator use prevalence drug relate problem ( primary outcome ) 52 % previous report Ethiopia . The effect size consider 1.5 Through calculation , final sample size arm 61 consider 20 % contingency loss follow , 73 participant need group . Therefore , total sample size 146 . For ambulatory patient , sample size calculate use prevalence three type drug relate problem ( indication , safety , effectiveness ) previous study . The prevalence effectiveness relate drug relate problem report 14 % . The effect size determine 1.4 parameter consider similar . Through calculation , 215 patient need group . Considering 10 % loss follow , total sample size 473 two group . Randomization conceal allocation Randomization complete Statistical Package Social Science version 21 generate algorithm . Treating assignment keep sealed opaque envelope number label open patient give informed consent . The assigned research assistant distribute envelope record patient group enrollment patient assignment . Blinding : research assistants trial responsible outcome recording blind treatment assignment . Intervention : Pharmacy Intervention group For Hospitalized Patients : Four full timer pharmacist train clinical pharmacy ( ward Pharmacists ) assign 8-15 patient medical ward provide clinical pharmacy service . Two full timer postgraduate year two clinical pharmacy student assign medical ward A Male medical ward B female . Two clinical pharmacist school pharmacy also assign ward . For Ambulatory Patients ; Two post graduate year II clinical pharmacy student assign outpatient department ambulatory care clinic . The assigned pharmacy professional sit physician make therapeutic decision consultation physician , develop therapeutic plan give patient education document documentation form . Control Group Patients control group get standard care physicians nurse . Measurement Primary outcome Interventions Pharmacy professional For hospitalized patient , intervention make pharmacy professional document pharmacy professional activity documentation form . Data collector abstract relevant data document . The data abstract data collector : Identified drug therapy problem intervention make resolve drug therapy problem . Suggestions prevention avoidance medication error . Cost medicine pharmaceutical . Cost hospitalization include cost laboratory investigation . Patient education give hospital stay discharge hospitalize patient . Recommendations make laboratory investigation treatment monitor do . Patient education hospital ambulatory patient . Secondary outcome Length hospital stay In hospital mortality Patient knowledge drug discharge Inpatient satisfaction health care service provide For ambulatory patient , Primary outcome Identified drug therapy problem intervention make resolve drug therapy problem . Cost medicine Secondary outcomes Patient knowledge prescribe medicine Statistical analysis : Statistical software Statistical Package Social Science 21 use analysis .
