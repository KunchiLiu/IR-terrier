	<brief_title>Mobile Technology &amp; Online Tools Track Adherence Chronic Illness Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances medical treatment option past several decade translate substantially high survival rate suffer chronic illness . Consequently , prevalence chronic illness risen significantly recent year , one every four youth United States currently live chronic illness . The health well-being youth directly impact degree adhere treatment regimen . However , treatment regimen chronic illness highly complex , make adherence problematic , particularly combine deficit memory executive function concomitant many chronic illness .

To , need provide accessible , affordable tool effectively increase patient ' skill knowledge manage illness support on-going adherence treatment regimen . The purpose project test efficacy Planet T1D , mobile web-based technology infrastructure specifically design ( ) enhance youth ' type 1 diabetes disease- treatment-related knowledge interactive game-based educational material ; ( b ) support adherence treatment regimen customize task prompt via mobile web-based delivery ; ( c ) promote patient-provider communication real-world data collection feedback loop . Investigators examine effectiveness Planet T1D mobile app website improve treatment adherence , disease-related knowledge , transition readiness , condition management , psychological correlate variable youth type 1 diabetes . All participant complete study measure pre- post-assessment time point . In total , participant take part study approximately 2 month pre- post-assessment . Families recruit participate either treatment condition control group . Families treatment condition receive Planet T1D app access associate website full duration study ( 2 month ) pre-test post-test . Families control group receive access app website , instead ask complete series online questionnaires two data collection time point ( pre-test , post-test ) . Investigators hypothesize great use ( i.e. , dosage ) prolong use Planet T1D access associate website : increase disease-related knowledge , treatment adherence , self-efficacy management type 1 diabetes , current type 1 diabetes self-management behavior , readiness transition independent self-care , perceive benefit type 1 diabetes treatment , also decrease perceive barrier type 1 diabetes treatment . Moreover , investigator believe improvement outcome use Planet T1D result positive mental health outcome patient , include high report quality life . Investigators expect treatment condition well outcome control group measure midpoint post-assessment time point . Finally , investigator expect participant report high usability , quality , value Planet T1D mobile app website positively rate experience Planet T1D .</detailed_description>
