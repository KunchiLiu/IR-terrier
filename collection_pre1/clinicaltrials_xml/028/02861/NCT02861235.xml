	<brief_summary>Myocardial perfusion tomoscintigraphy routine medicine procedure check presence severity abnormalities myocardial perfusion , well extension infarction residuum . However , actual imagery device ( gamma camera ) low resolution detection sensitivity . A new semiconductor camera 8 10 time high detection sensitivity could allow proportionally diminish injected activity record time . Only one pilot study recently publish type camera , D.SPECT camera . This study compare image record 15 20 minute conventional camera 2 4 minute D.SPECT camera patient tomoscintigraphy usual condition . The purpose demonstrate equivalence image record two camera type diagnostic information secondary purpose demonstrate superiority D.SPECT camera term image quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Myocardial Tomoscintigraphies Using Semiconductor Camera Conventional Camera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct Nuclear Medicine department ( Nancy Hospital , Bichat Hospital Paris , Pasteur private hospital Toulouse ) , D.SPECT camera ( Cyclopharma ) . The D.SPECT camera record realize follow conventional camera record modify routine program examination . Recording time D.SPECT camera maximum 2 minute image strong activity technetium-99m label dye maximum 4 minute image thallium-201 low activity technetium-99m label dye.6 study group analyze : 4 group patient initially stress tomoscintigraphy thallium-201 ( group 1 ) technetium-99m label dye test 3 principal injection sequence ( group 2 , 3 , 4 ) , 2 group patient initially `` myocardial viability '' assessment rest tomoscintigraphy thallium-201 ( group 5 ) technetium-99m label dye . Recording comparison obtain 2 camera do accord qualitative quantitative criterion image quality analyze diagnosis concordance ( presence , type severity observe abnormality ) .</detailed_description>
