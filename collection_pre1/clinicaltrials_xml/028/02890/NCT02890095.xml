	<detailed_description>Exposure certain class chemical contaminant , include certain persistent organic pollutant ( POPs ) character endocrine disruptors , could one factor lead increase incidence breast cancer Western world . However , causal role POPs onset breast cancer remain nowadays unproven . Preliminary epidemiological study impact environmental factor breast cancer etiology ignore critical period exposure . Similarly , consider limited number pollutant ( include possible joint synergistic effect individual compound ) distinguish different breast cancer subtypes may different etiology even genetic susceptibility factor ( POP polymorphism detoxification enzyme ) . Finally , demonstration do 2 reason : - Multidisciplinary Issues , - Need innovative tool statistical analysis interpretation integrate environmental data . Thus , POPCASE study examine association presence breast cancer level exposure profile group POPs measure adipose tissue ( AT ) blood , particular use spectrometric method develop team LABERCA ( Nantes , France ) . These internal level POPs ( organochlorine pesticide , dioxin , PCBs , brominate flame retardant ) measure quantitatively ( tissue concentration ) qualitative ( relative proportion different pollutant seek ) . It therefore improve level knowledge environmental chemical exposure increase incidence breast cancer ( environmental , genetic molecular component ) within general population , response public health issue , question actual impact health major class chemical pollutant present environment stay power behind debate associate high stake , scientist economic societal .</detailed_description>
