	<brief_title>Dasatinib Holiday Improved Tolerability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dasatinib indicate Europe : - Treatment adult patient newly diagnose Philadelphia chromosome positive ( Ph+ ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) chronic phase - Chronic , accelerate blast phase CML resistance intolerance prior therapy include imatinib - Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) lymphoid blast CML resistance intolerance prior therapy Compared imatinib , dasatinib CML achieve faster good response . Dasatinib know select toxicity ( fluid retention , edema , pleural effusion , hematological toxicity ) require dose reduction treatment interruption ; toxicity frequent first two year treatment . A randomized dose optimization trial QD dose vs. BID dose demonstrate non-inferiority regard efficacy improve toxicity profile . In pilot study , analyze patient dasatinib toxicity , fix dasatinib weekend holiday allow safe toxicity management without impair efficacy . Furthermore alternated schedule also able improve response parameter patient never achieve acceptable response prior onset dasatinib holiday dose schedule . The biological rationale holiday dose schedule dasatinib show improved cell death CML cell even short exposure time ; improve cell death exceeds kill rate observe imatinib vitro . In summary , report preclinical clinical evidence indicate efficacy seem require adequate dasatinib Cmax , low Cmin ( five half-lives dos ) impair efficacy induces drug resistance . It speculate weekend holiday , allow good tolerability , would improve patient ' drug adherence . The Investigators hypothesize dasatinib holiday schedule ( 5x100mg+2x0mg weekly ) compare regular dose ( 7x100mg weekly ) reduce rate clinically significant toxicity ( e.g. , fluid retention , hematological toxicity , musculoskeletal pain ) 20 % observe within first two year treatment . The Investigators also hypothesize dasatinib holiday schedule non-inferior dasatinib regular dose achieve European LeukemiaNet ( ELN ) recommend level response within first 24 month .</detailed_description>
