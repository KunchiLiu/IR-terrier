	<brief_summary>The main goal antidepressant treatment achieve remission depressive episode prevent recurrence . However , clinical trial design approve antidepressant target response rate least 50 % , consider partially effective . Therefore , need new treatment strategy , include augmentation substance lithium . This research aim verify pilot study , effect selenium augmentation treatment sertraline-resistant major depression . This clinical trial design randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial evaluate effect selenium placebo subject diagnose major depression respond treatment sertraline</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenium Augmentation Treatment Sertraline Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research aim verify pilot study effect selenium augmentation treatment sertraline-resistant major depression , secondary endpoint , level selenium patient depressive episode different individual without depression . Thus , clinical trial intend randomize double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate effect selenium placebo patient diagnose major depression respond treatment sertraline appropriate dose treatment duration . The initial sample comprise patient moderate severe major depression , receive sertraline 200mg/day , least 8 week . A group subject without major depression select control sample , submit procedure include patient . It estimate initial sample 90 patient major depression ( DSM-IV criterion ) , 30 patient resistant treatment , randomly divide two group ( selenium placebo ) . The control group sample estimate 45 subject . For diagnosis major depression , use Structured Clinical Interview DSM Axis I disorder ( SCID Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I disorder ) . To evaluate outcome treatment depressive symptom , use Clinical Global Impression Scale Patient Global Impression Scale ( CGI PGI ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 item depression ( HAM-D-17 ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) SAFTEE- ( brief structure interview assess adverse event ) . The exclusion criterion include patient diagnosis psychosis , bipolar disorder , personality disorder , psychiatric condition need hospitalization , severe risk suicide , recent drug abuse dependence , use polyvitamin substance , substance know relevant psychopharmacological action , woman know suspected pregnancy breastfeeding , people unstable organic disease lupus erythematosus , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism . Participation voluntary , participant gender must age 18 year . After check exclusion inclusion criterion ( visit 0 ) , first phase study start completion follow laboratory test : serum level selenium , electrocardiogram , hematology ( hemoglobin , hematocrit , white blood cell count , platelet count ) , SGOT , SGPT , gammaGT , urea , creatinine , fast glucose , TSH , free T4 , T3 , Na , K , total cholesterol + triglycerides fraction , urine analysis . The second phase consist treatment patient depression sertraline , receive initial dosage 50 mg / day 200 mg maximum tolerate dose , accord investigator 's decision , least 8 week . Patients consider resistant-sertraline ( Hamilton-D-17 &gt; 7 ) invite participate double-blind randomization phase treatment group placebo selenium ( 400 mcg / day ) . Sertraline maintain throughout whole phase randomization . As trial would complete , participant refer outpatient care community health service . Initially variables analyze descriptively . In phase 1 Student 's test use order compare serum level selenium group . At stage 2 comparison pre post treatment Sertraline use non-parametric McNemar test step 3 , determine behavior group six week , use analysis variance repeat measure .</detailed_description>
