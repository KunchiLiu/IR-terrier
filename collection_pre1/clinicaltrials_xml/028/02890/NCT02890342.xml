	<brief_summary>Background : People body need break food chemical . These chemical use energy growth . Some people process chemical well . Too much chemical cause disease . One diseases call propionic acidemia ( PA ) . People PA problem growth , learn heart , abdomen , organ . Researchers want good understand problem happen . Objective : To learn propionic acidemia gene might contribute . Eligibility : People least 2 year old PA travel clinic Some unaffected family member Design : Participants 3 5-day hospital visit every year every year . Family member may 1 visit . During family member visit , may : Medical history Physical exam Samples blood urine Questions diet food diary Doctors nurse may additional study : Samples saliva , skin stool Fluid gastronomy tube , participant one Dental eye evaluation A kidney test - small amount dye inject blood collect . Consultations specialist A test calorie need rest . A clear plastic tent place participant measure breathe . Stable isotope study . Participants take nonradioactive substance blow bag . Photos take face body underwear Ultrasound abdomen Heart test Hand x-ray Brain scan Participants may test study doctor recommend . They get result standard medical test genetic test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Propionic acidemia ( PA ) one common inborn error organic acid metabolism . Although disorder routinely detect immediate neonatal period US newborn screen , clinical outcome poor despite timely aggressive medical intervention [ Kolker , Cazorla , et al 2015 ; Leonard et al 2003 ] . Worldwide , incidence PA vary widely . The estimated live-birth incidence PA 1:105,000-130,000 US [ Chace et al 2001 ; Couce et al 2011 ] , 1:166,000 Italy [ Dionisi-Vici et al 2002 ] 1:250,000 Germany [ Schulze et al 2003 ] . Affected patient medically fragile suffer complication failure thrive , intellectual disability , basal ganglion stroke , seizure , cardiomyopathy , cardiac arrhythmia , pancreatitis , impaired gut motility , hematological complication . The frequency complication US patient precipitant remain undefined . Furthermore , current treatment outcome continue demonstrate substantial morbidity mortality patient population . Specific treatment include dietary modification reduce propiogenic precursor load , levocarnitine facilitate excretion propionate , oral antibiotic suppress propiogenic gut flora . More recently , solid organ transplantation ( liver and/or kidney ) use treat PA patient . However , optimal transplant strategy posttransplant management incompletely understood . Several survey-based retrospective study describe natural history propionic acidemia publish last decade [ Baumgartner et al 2014 ; Kolker , Cazorla , et al 2015 ; Kolker , Valayannopoulos , et al 2015 ; Kraus et al 2012 ; Nizon et al 2013 ; Pena &amp; Burton 2012 ; Pena , Franks , et al 2012 ] . While publication add understanding clinical course disease , study systematically focus US population use prospective analysis reflect largely European experience , many develop country routinely screen PA use newborn screen . Thus , benefit newborn screen PA outcomes require clarification [ Grunert et al 2012 ] . Under propose NIH protocol , prospectively evaluate patient propionic acidemia special emphasis US population . Routine inpatient admission outpatient evaluation last 4-5 day involve blood drawing , urine collection , stool collection , genomic study , ophthalmological examination , cardiology evaluation , radiological procedure , brain cardiac MRI/MRS , dietary assessment neurobehavioral evaluation . In patient skin biopsy pursue . The study objectives describe natural history propionic acidemia US patient delineate spectrum phenotype query genotype , enzymology , microbiome , phenotype correlation . The population consist patient previously evaluate NIH , physician referral , family direct study clinicaltrials.gov , Organic Acidemia Association Propionic Acidemia Foundation . Patients evaluate NIH Clinical Center . Outcome measure largely descriptive encompass correlation clinical , microbiological , biochemical molecular parameter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients 2 year age old eligible enroll study . Patients biochemical , molecular enzymatic evidence propionic acidemia gender ethnicity eligible enroll protocol . Patients suspect genetic unknown type propionic acidemia may also invite participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude travel NIH medical condition . Pregnant patient eligible participate study . However , may take part test , example stable isotope study . The principal investigator may decline enroll patient reason . Other criterion may lead exclusion include , example , reside hospital , suboptimal metabolic control determine Dr. Venditti 's review laboratory data , patient require dialysis week weigh less 40 kg , patient treat intercurrent infection antibiotic evidence acute infection , patient regular/local metabolic , genetic endocrine physician and/or family physician , pediatrician , internist .</criteria>
