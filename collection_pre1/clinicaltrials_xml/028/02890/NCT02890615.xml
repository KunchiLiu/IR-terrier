	<brief_title>CanDirect : Effectiveness Telephone-supported Depression Self-care Intervention Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pragmatic randomized control superiority trial aim assess effectiveness telephone-supported depression SCI cancer survivor moderate depressive symptom give addition usual care , comparison usual care . Because pragmatic nature trial , member group continue receive `` usual care '' depression , may vary widely depend local resource medical practice . At follow-up , participant ask specific treatment receive depression since enter study ( antidepressant medication initiation , discontinuation , change dose , psychotherapy ) participation community support group related activity ; investigator explore whether care mediates effect intervention . The study include safeguard participant become suicidal severely depressed study . Research question Among cancer survivor post-treatment phase moderate moderately-severe depressive symptom [ Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) score 8-19 ] : 1 . Primary research question : What effect telephone-supported depression self-care intervention ( SCI ) plus usual care compare usual care ( control group CTL ) primary outcome - severity depression symptom measure Centre Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) 6 month randomization ? Hypothesis : Participants receive SCI well 6 month primary outcome randomize Control group . 2 . Secondary question : 1 . What effect SCI : CES-D score 3 month ; depression diagnosis 6 month ; mental health relate quality life , activation , severity anxiety symptoms 3 6 month , use health service 6 month ? Hypothesis : Participants receive SCI good health outcome low use health service randomize Control group . 2 . Are effect SCI primary outcome modify 5 primary baseline patient characteristic [ major depression diagnosis ; antidepressant medication ; activation ; recruitment source ( clinical v community ) ; level education ] 9 secondary patient characteristic [ cancer type , ongoing adjuvant cancer treatment ( yes , ) , year cancer diagnosis ( quartile ) , severity anxiety ( measure Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale ( HADS-A ) ) , physical health-related quality life ( measured Physical Component Summary ( PCS ) Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) ) ( quartile ) , sex , age ( quartile ) , family support self-management ( quartile ) , province residence ( Quebec , Ontario ) ] . Hypothesis support Effect moderator ( modifier ) represent variable e.g . patient characteristic , measure baseline , interact treatment change outcome sub-group . These specify treatment effective improve power subsequent trial good selection study group stratification . In select potential modifiers/moderators pre-specified testing , investigator follow consensus criterion assessment factor . Pinctus propose 5 criterion systematic review randomize controlled trial confirm moderator effect : 1 ) analysis priori ; 2 ) selection factor analysis clinically plausible either theory-based evidence-based ; 3 ) moderator measure prior randomization ; 4 ) adequate quality measurement ; 5 ) explicit test interaction moderator treatment . For meta-analyses explore moderator effect , criterion 1 2 require . Investigators analyze 5 possible moderator use sub-group analysis : Major depression They hypothesize intervention effective among participant diagnosis major depression ( measure Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Disorders - Major Depressive Syndrome Mood Disorders Module ( SCID ) ) without . A meta-analysis psychosocial intervention cancer population find study patient pre-selected high level distress found great effectiveness intervention . A meta-analysis depression self-care intervention also report great effectiveness patient major depression , although univariate analysis . Antidepressant medication Investigators hypothesize intervention effective among participant baseline antidepressant medication without . A meta-analysis find combination psychotherapy pharmacotherapy effective treatment depression psychotherapy alone . Activation Investigators hypothesize intervention effective among participant high baseline activation low level . As accepted cut-point Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) scale , high activation define PAM score high quartile . In randomized controlled trial depression self-care intervention among primary care patient chronic physical condition , investigator find coach effective among patient high baseline self-efficacy ( one component activation ) . Recruitment source Investigators hypothesize intervention effective among participant recruit community setting clinical setting . A meta-analysis depression self-care intervention also report low effectiveness patient study clinical setting , although univariate analysis . Participants recruit community setting study ( e.g. , community group social medium ) already select motivated participate actively intervention . Level education Investigators hypothesize intervention effective among participant high education , define education beyond high school ( e.g , diploma university ) , compare high school less education . Investigators aware evidence support hypothesis , use paper pencil electronic tool familiar high level education . In addition 5 hypothesized moderator , investigator propose examine follow 9 secondary potential baseline moderator , maximum 4 category : cancer type , ongoing adjuvant cancer treatment ( yes , ) , year cancer diagnosis ( quartile ) , severity anxiety ( HADS ) , physical health-related quality life ( PCS ) ( quartile ) , sex , age ( quartile ) , family support self-management ( quartile ) , province residence ( Quebec , Ontario ) . 3 . In Intervention group , great adherence SCI ( e.g. , use self-care tool , completion write exercise mood monitoring , goal setting , great number coach contact ) associate well primary secondary outcome ? Hypothesis : Participants adhere SCI , particularly actively engage Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) -based tool great reduction depressive symptom , diagnosis , severity anxiety symptom , great increase activation quality life . 3 . Economic analysis : An economic analysis SCI beyond scope study . In current study , investigator collect patient-reported data use health service request additional ( optional ) consent linkage health care administrative data ( Ontario Health Insurance Plan ( OHIP ) Claims database Discharge Abstract Database ( DAD ) ) . They plan seek additional funding analysis use service administrative data future study impact SCI use service . They extract use service data patient consent optional element , period 12 month 12 month date enrolment present trial . Patients consent use administrative data ask provide OHIP number allow researcher extract require data .</detailed_description>
