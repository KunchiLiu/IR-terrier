	<brief_title>Iodine Mapping Using Subtraction Pulmonary Embolism CT Versus Dual-Energy CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Iodine mapping lung use subtraction image addition standard compute tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) may improve evaluation pulmonary embolism ( PE ) manner addition dual energy compute tomography ( DECT ) CTPA . Objective : To evaluate image quality accuracy detection perfusion defect associate pulmonary pathology iodine map lung create two different CT technique : 1 . A standard care CTPA DECT 2 . A new technique subtracts low radiation dose unenhanced CT mono-energetic CTPA ( subtraction ) Study design : A maximum 375 patient undergo standard CTPA DECT accord local clinical guideline , 30 patient pulmonary embolism . For purpose study , patient undergo additional unenhanced , low-radiation dose chest CT. Standard reconstruction scan DECT iodine map obtain clinical reporting subsequent treatment decision , accord standard clinical routine . For research purpose , select mono-energetic image post-processed use novel subtraction algorithm create iodine map lung . The iodine map base subtraction algorithm use clinical management , additional unenhanced scan use clinical management . Study population : Patients present clinical indication pulmonary CT angiography suspect pulmonary embolism . Only adult patient ( â‰¥ 35 year ) able provide inform consent enrol . Main study parameters/endpoints : Main endpoint study presence perfusion establish expert panel access image information ( include CTPA , subtraction DECT ) clinical follow-up . Accuracy DECT subtraction establish observer blind CTPA clinical data . Presence iodine density difference perfusion defect measure use region interest ( ROI ) measurement . Images evaluate objective subjective image quality . Patient characteristic , radiation dose , clinical diagnosis , treatment decision patient outcome ( cause - PE related mortality ) record . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : CT image associate risk relate use radiation iodinate contrast administration . No additional contrast use compare standard clinical practice patient undergo one CTPA scan . The CT protocol study carefully design radiation dose identical even low standard CT protocols pulmonary embolism detection . The estimated dose-length product ( DLP ) standard CTPA DECT Meander Medical Centre 167 mGy-cm ( effective dose 2.4 mSv , use 0,0146 mSv/mGy-cm conversion factor ) . The researcher expose patient participate study estimate additional DLP 72 mGy-cm due unenhanced scan , result additional estimate effective dose 1,0 mSv . This imply total radiation dose within range radiation dos scan PE detection Netherlands . The additional scan obligatory pulmonary embolism diagnosis , use clinical evaluation patient .</detailed_description>
