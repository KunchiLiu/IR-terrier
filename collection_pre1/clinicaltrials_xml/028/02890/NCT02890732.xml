	<detailed_description>The patient education activity center coronary artery disease , show efficiency , combination exercise training . Unfortunately issue educational care low maintain long-term change lifestyle adherence drug intake limit major health challenge originally recidivism rate high coronary disease . In context , therapeutic measure enable patient well integrate daily life recommendation long term fundamental . As part expertise Toulouse University Hospital field therapeutic education coronary patient , investigator decide develop Smartphone application aim strengthen modernize educational care patient . Based accurate comprehensive assessment lifestyle , technical element Smartphone support , also provide innovative educational material ( video , interactive software ... ) , treat ( pharmacological : diet , physical activity , toxic consumption ) may thus optimize accord principle telemedicine . This project benefit result concept study conduct July October 2014 group coronary patient . This first study help develop precise contour Appet HEART application production prototype version use clinical feasibility study . The objective feasibility study : 1. ass rate use application 2. determine ideal target population application 3. evaluate effectiveness application 4. measure risk potential limitation use 5. determine medical economic impact application This single-center study . Patients recruit Toulouse University Hospital cardiac service patient come coronary heart disease . After inclusion , patient receive initial educational diagnosis determine individualize educational goal management coronary disease . Patients receive training use Appet HEART application . Using application provide year . The evaluation criterion study original conduct hetero self protocol monitoring time . Chronologically investigator note : - An initial assessment hetero judgment criteria - A self- evaluation every three month one year via smartphone criterion via questionnaire - A final visit schedule perform hetero- evaluation initial .</detailed_description>
