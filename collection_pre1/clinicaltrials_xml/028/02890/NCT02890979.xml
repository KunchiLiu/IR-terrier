	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well swallowable sponge cell sample device next generation sequence work detect esophageal cancer patient low high grade dysplasia , Barrett esophagus , gastroesophageal reflux disease . Checking biomarkers abnormal esophageal cell use swallowable sponge cell sample device next generation sequencing may improve diagnosis treatment esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swallowable Sponge Cell Sampling Device Next Generation Sequencing Detecting Esophageal Cancer Patients With Low High Grade Dysplasia , Barrett Esophagus , Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine sensitivity specificity next generation sequence detection esophageal cancer esophageal sponge cytology specimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine ability next generation gene sequence ( NGS ) esophageal sponge sample collect adequate sample detect mutation present underlying tissue . II . Determine cost associate esophageal cytology next generation genome sequence screen tool . III . Continue collect safety tolerability data relate use esophageal sponge . IV . Determine limitation esophageal sponge cytology future need improve technique . V. Use data collect design large screen trial determine ability esophageal cytology next generation sequence screen esophageal cancer general population . OUTLINE : Patients undergo cytology specimen collection procedure use swallowable sponge cell sample device .</detailed_description>
