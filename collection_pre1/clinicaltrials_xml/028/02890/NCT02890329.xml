	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give together decitabine treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia return period improvement respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , decitabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ipilimumab decitabine may work well treat patient relapsed refractory myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Decitabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination decitabine ipilimumab relapse refractory myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( allo-HCT ) . II . To determine MTD RP2D combination decitabine ipilimumab relapse refractory MDS relapse refractory AML patient transplant naive . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity . II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) include complete remission ( CR ) complete remission incomplete count recovery ( CRi ) AML follow 2003 International Working Group ( IWG ) response criterion . III . To determine ORR include CR , partial remission , marrow CR , hematologic improvement MDS use 2006 IWG criterion . IV . To determine overall survival progression free survival 1 year . V. To determine duration remission . VI . To determine incidence acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) post allo-HCT cohort . VII . To determine incidence acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) transplant naive cohort . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) prior treatment treatment . II . To evaluate genome evidence clonal evolution among longitudinal sample ( prior treatment , treatment , relapse relevant ) individual patient . III . To evaluate histopathologic finding immune response use immunohistochemistry . IV . To determine immune response AML tumor microenvironment use flow cytometry single cell mass cytometry evaluate T cell subset . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab . ARM A ( PATIENTS POST ALLO-HCT ) : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1-5 ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive decitabine IV 60 minute day 1-5 ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( TRANSPLANT NA√èVE PATIENTS ) : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive decitabine IV 60 minute day 1-5 ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive decitabine IV 60 minute day 1-5 ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 52 week ( 1 year ) .</detailed_description>
