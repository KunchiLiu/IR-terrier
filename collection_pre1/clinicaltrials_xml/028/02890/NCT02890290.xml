	<brief_title>Effect Study Marine Protein Hydrolysates Prevent Loss Muscle Mass Physical Function Frail Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective project study nutrition influence frailty physical function home-dwelling elderly . The study seek answer follow hypothesis ( RCT ) : 1 . Sarcopenia measure SPPB , grip strength , estimate leg muscle volume gait speed significantly associate nutritional status intake protein frail elderly . 2 . A supplement 3000mg marine peptide pr . day 12 month intervention group improve score SPPB sarcopenia-related outcome like grip strength , estimate leg muscle volume gait speed compare placebo group . To supplement result RCT , interview perform selected participant answer follow question : - How frail elderly describe nutritional status need help municipal health care service relate nutrition ? The data collection make participant ' home baseline 6 12 month . The patient complete Short Physical Performance Test ( SPPB ) , Grip Strength measurement anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , calf circumference leg muscle volume estimation use skinfold caliper ) . Assessment nutritional status make Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) . Seafood intake protein intake assess food frequency questionnaire base previously use validated questionnaire . Daily energy intake estimate 24-hour multiple pas recall food intake . Health related quality life assess EQ-5D-5L questionnaire ( EuroQol ) . In addition , participant ask take blood test analyze vitamin D , nutritional inflammation marker . Sample size statistical power calculation The main outcome study physical performance , measure 12 point ordinal scale ; SPPB . In accordance previous study , clinical meaningful change score scale 0,4 - 1,5 point . Based mean value SD mention study , power compute SPSS ( IMB ) Power Sample t-test independent sample . The criterion significance ( alpha ) set 0,050 test 2-tailed . With sample size 39 two group , study power 80 % yield statistically significant result . This computation assume difference group 0.9 point . As participant frail old age , expect dropout/missing frequency 20 % , thus 50 participant group . Statistical analyze The null hypothesis difference intervention control group , change physical performance across multiple test attempt . As SPPB score ordinal scale , investigator use non-parametric multifactorial method like Friedman ` test detect difference treatment across multiple test attempt . ANOVA test may use assess secondary outcome numeric scale , e.g . grip strength , muscle volume gait speed . Pearson Spearman rank correlation use explore relationship continuous variable . In-depth interview Interviews provide deep understanding potential result RCT . Fifteen twenty participant select interview purposeful recruitment , base result RCT study . The interview transcribe analyzed use qualitative content analysis . Ethical consideration This project approve Regional Committee Ethics Medical Research Mid- Norway . The investigator anticipate project cause harm discomfort participant , make sure participant participate study voluntarily . Participants give oral write information study twice give consent participate . First , receive information home care nurse , agree receive call visit researcher , opportunity ask question sign write consent . Furthermore , inform possibility withdraw study without consequence time . The project considerable benefit patient group . Increased knowledge nutritional status protein intake patient group may facilitate nutritional intervention prevent loss physical function , potentially lead increase independence delay need residential institution . Results RCT may transferable patient condition muscle atrophy expect , e.g . inactivity injury , bed rest surgery , intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
