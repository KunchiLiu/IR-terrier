	<detailed_description>[ INTRODUCTION ] The success combination HIV prevention effort , include HIV treatment prevention , hinge universal , routine HIV test linkage care antiretroviral treatment initiation HIV diagnosis . The propose study evaluate comparative effectiveness sustainability innovative incentive strategy , inform directly behavioral economics decision psychology , promote HIV test among men HIV treatment among HIV-infected adult rural Uganda . [ OBJECTIVES ] AIM 1 : Adult men live study community rural Uganda ( N=3,000 ) randomize one three ( fix , loss aversion , lottery ) incentive approach different incentive amount encourage HIV test . The hypothesis lottery loss aversion incentive result significantly high test uptake fixed incentive . The investigator also hypothesize proportion tester arm HIV-infected ( secondary outcome ) high lottery-based incentive . In sub-samples men test , investigator conduct in-depth interview assess perception , attitude preference related incentive may affect incentive influence test . AIM 2 : Adult men woman live study community ( N=400 ) obtain HIV-positive result community health campaign randomize one two incentive approach encourage HIV treatment adherence . The investigator hypothesize financial incentive effective incentive promote HIV virologic suppression ( measure success ART adherence navigation HIV treatment cascade ) incentives capitalize present bias draw attention salient , immediate benefit initiate and/or maintain treatment , leverage loss aversion generate implicit loss result delay decision initiate ART . AIM 3 : The investigator examine extent incentive one year ( Aim 1 ) affect participation subsequent test effort without incentive . Investigators also assess effect Aim 2 intervention viral suppression 6 month incentive discontinue , i.e . 12 month . This reveal whether incentive increase decrease men 's motivation future HIV testing . Investigators also calculate incremental cost incentive per additional person test enrol care well cost per disability-adjusted life year ( DALY ) avert . The overall objective generate evidence best use low-cost incentive promote HIV test among adult men maximize benefit ART among HIV-infected adult rural Uganda , critically evaluate sustainability intervention .</detailed_description>
