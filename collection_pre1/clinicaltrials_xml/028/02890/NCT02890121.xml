	<detailed_description>The main objective PRECISESADS project reclassify individual affect SADs molecular cluster instead clinical entity determination molecular profile use several `` -omics '' technique . The specific objective cross sectional study sub-study : 1 . To identify systemic taxonomy patient SADs produce follow data individual SADs control : genetic , epigenomic , transcriptomic , flow cytometric ( peripheral blood mononuclear polymorphonuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ) , metabolomics proteomic plasma urine , exosome analysis , classical serology ( antibody autoantibody ) , clinical data . 2 . To good characterize individual SADs omics level . 3 . To perform clustering analysis determine group individual , differentially group , share specific molecular feature ( precision medicine ) . 4 . To identify gene expression , methylation profile deconvolution method compare mixture cell subpopulation determine flow cytometry separate cell , cytokine profile plasma metabolomics use Mass Spectrometry , substudy 288 individual . The cluster process data-driven aim find homogenous differentiated cluster diseases clearly separate individual basis , serological , genetic , epigenomic , cellular ( cell proportion ) , metabolomic , proteomic ( cytokine , autoantibody ) transcriptome characteristic differentiate control patient cluster . A total 2000 patient 666 control include study , adjust follow distribution : - A total 400 patient diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) - A total 400 patient diagnose rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) - A total 400 patient diagnosed scleroderma systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) - A total 400 patient diagnose Sjögren 's syndrome ( SjS ) - A total 400 patient diagnosed primary antiphospholipid syndrome ( PAPS ) Mixed Connective Tissue Disease ( MCTD ) undifferentiated disease • All patient recruit 18 site Europe ( Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Portugal , Spain , Hungary Switzerland ) .</detailed_description>
