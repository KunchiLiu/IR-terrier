	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well modify irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ( FOLFIRI ) veliparib second line therapy work compare FOLFIRI treat patient pancreatic cancer come back period improvement ( metastatic ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether modified FOLFIRI veliparib second line therapy effective FOLFIRI alone treat metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FOLFIRI Modified FOLFIRI Veliparib Second Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) metastatic pancreatic cancer patient treat fluorouracil , irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) , leucovorin ( leucovorin calcium ) , ( modify FOLFIRI ) ABT-888 ( veliparib ) compare control arm fluorouracil , irinotecan , leucovorin ( FOLFIRI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment arm patient population . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment arm patient population . III . To evaluate overall response rate ( confirm unconfirmed ; complete response + partial response ) , disease control rate ( confirm unconfirmed ; complete response + partial response + stable disease ) , duration response treatment arm patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate breast cancer , early onset ( BRCA ) 1 BRCA2 mutation ( somatic germline ) associate improved clinical outcome ( overall survival [ OS ] , progression-free survival [ PFS ] overall response rate [ ORR ] ) treatment arm . II . To evaluate impact homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) score clinical outcome treatment arm . III . To evaluate impact genomic alteration identify BROCA-homologous recombinant ( HR ) assay , BRCA1/2 , clinical outcome treatment arm . IV . To bank tissue future translational medicine study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) every 12 hour day 1-7 , irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90-120 minute day 3 , leucovorin calcium IV 90-120 minute day 3 , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 3-5 . ARM II : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90-120 minute day 1 , leucovorin calcium IV 90-120 minute day 1 , fluorouracil IV bolus 15 minute day 1 46 hour day 1-3 . In arm , course repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
