	<brief_summary>The determinant associate severe outcome death Escherichia coli bloodstream infection ( BSI ) remain poorly understood . The epidemiology E. coli BSI recently change dramatically global emergence multiresistant strain produce extended-spectrum ß-lactamases ( ESBL ) . Outcome bad case ESBL-E. coli , may due intrinsic virulence ESBL-E. coli delay adequate empirical antibiotic therapy multiresistance . Predicting severity infection soon initial clinical assessment major importance provide best care , limit unnecessary hospitalization cost . Yet , simple clinical score exist predict severity E. coli infection . In translational approach , investigator include maximum one year 500 adult E. coli BSI hospitalize 7 hospital Paris area , France . Precise clinical data collect inclusion 28 day inclusion upon patient 's discharge ( day 28 ) . The primary endpoint study death E. coli BSI day 28 . The first aim determine risk-factors death day 28 , include clinical bacteriological factor ( determine WGS ) era global emergence ESBL produce E. coli . The second aim determine virulence characteristic ESBL strain genome phenotypic level thanks mouse model septicaemia , compare clinical data . The third aim , establish evaluate simple clinical severity score ( name COLISCORE ) , order help clinician evaluate patient ' severity upon initial clinical evaluation particularly detect patient risk severe outcome . The ultimate goal work clinical impact patient ' management , understand determinant patient severity due E. coli BSI context current major epidemiological change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project conduct collaboration ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS ( Paris teach hospital ) Infection , Antimicrobials , Modelling Evolution ( IAME ) research group , joint appointment Paris DIDEROT University , Paris Nord University INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE ( INSERM ) . This study prospective multicentric non interventional observational , study , include 500 patient 7 hospital . Study Centres : Seven hospital affiliate IAME research group include ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS network participate . The seven hospital tertiary care teach hospital Paris close suburb , part ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS network . They account total 4230 acute-care adult bed . A total 780 E. coli BSI occur centre 1 year 15 % ESBL produce strain . This study include adult patient hospitalize one seven participate centre base inclusion exclusion criterion list . A total 14 clinical investigator ( CI ) microbiology investigator ( MI ) responsible patient ' inclusion data collection 7 study centre . Visits . Two visit organise : Visit 1 : day patient 's inclusion study ( =day result first positive blood culture ) Visit 2 : day patient leave hospital day 28 Visit 1 still hospitalize . At visit 1 , E. coli strain responsible BSI well positive sample conserve sent central laboratory full genome sequence E. coli strain ( IAME Laboratory , University Paris DIDEROT ) . The investigator analyze molecular characteristic strain use high-throughput sequencing technique try highlight virulence factor compare result clinical data . Endpoints The primary endpoint work death day 28 ( visit 2 ) . Multiple secondary endpoint study day 28 include length hospital stay need intensive care . Statistics For primary endpoint investigator analyse risk factor associate death day 28 ( yes/no ) use logistic regression . The clinical risk factor achieve P value &lt; 0.10 entered multivariate logistic regression model . A backward selection method use obtain model clinical risk factor P value &lt; 0.05 . Second , link death various bacteriological factor study use similar approach . Third , final multivariate logistic regression perform add bacterial factor final model clinical risk factor perform backward analysis . The investigator also perform exploratory analysis study association E. coli gene death , model adjust important clinical factor define . The investigator use result multivariate analysis elaborate clinical severity score E. coli BSI , call COLISCORE . The objective COLISCORE predict patient ' severity outcome upon admission help clinician 's initial management decision . This score simple easy use patient ' bedside .</detailed_description>
