	<brief_summary>The project base check effectiveness technique suboccipital inhibition patient mechanical neck pain . Suboccipital inhibition technique involve placement hand physiotherapist patient 's head finger feel spinous process cervical vertebra . Then finger slowly lead upward contact occipital condyle . At point investigator gently move finger , find space condyle spinous process axis . Then , flex metacarpophalangeal joint 90 degree , slowly raise skull . In technique investigator would carry relaxation suboccipital muscle : low rectus capitis posterior , superior oblique head straight back head higher . It technique use often without knowledge time need implementation . In several study use technique maintain 2.4 10 minute without agree long necessary . The study consist three group form patient mechanical neck pain apply technique two , four ten minute control group patient mechanical neck pain . The four group measure treatment pain threshold pressure algometer conduct test reposition head show change application technique .</brief_summary>
