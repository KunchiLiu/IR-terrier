	<brief_title>Molecular Reclassification Find Clinically Useful Biomarkers Systemic Autoimmune Diseases : Inception Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective PRECISESADS IMI project reclassify individual affect SADs cluster molecular , instead clinical entity determination molecular profile use several `` -omics '' technique . The identification cluster relies cross sectional ( CS ) cohort/protocol 2666 individual ( 2000 patient 666 control ) include sub-study 288 deeply characterized individual ( 240 patient 48 control ) recruit . In parallel longitudinal inception cohort/protocol start order explore clinical relevance identify cluster evolution time . The objective CS study sub-study : 1 . To identify systemic taxonomy patient SADs produce follow data individual SADs control : genetic , epigenomic , transcriptomic , flow cytometric ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ) , metabolomics proteomic plasma urine , exosome analysis , classical serology ( antibody autoantibody ) , clinical data . 2 . To good characterize individual SADs omics level . 3 . To perform clustering analysis determine group individual , differentially group , share specific molecular feature ( precision medicine ) . 4 . A deep analysis do substudy 288 individual . The cluster process data-driven aim find homogenous differentiated cluster diseases clearly separate differentiate individual control patient cluster . Aims Inception cohort : Specifically , inception cohort aim : 1. assign individual newly diagnose systemic autoimmune disease ( SAD ) reclassification cluster discover CS study , 2. study development modification OMICS signatures/clusters occur individual patient course disease , include impact treatment individual pattern , 3. perform deep ( thorough ) OMICs study compare patterns OMICS group , pattern obtain CS cohort . The inception cohort patient follow sample collection baseline , month 6 ( ±1 month ) month 18 ( ±1 month ) . As newly diagnose patient plan recruit minimum treatment , identify difference similitudes patient cross-sectional study undergone long-term treatment .</detailed_description>
