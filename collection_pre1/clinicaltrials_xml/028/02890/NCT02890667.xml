	<detailed_description>`` This study population base observational study conduct French administrative database estimate cancer incidence 2012 use `` ECHANTILLON GENERALISTE DES BENEFICIAIRES '' ( EGB , 1/97th dynamic random sample SNIIRAM ) . The EGB database contain anonymous prospectively record data beneficiary ' medical reimbursement include age , gender , long-term chronic disease ( LTD ) , date death , out-hospital health-spending reimbursement patient ' hospitalization . Many algorithm definition define estimate incident rate cancer 2012 EGB database apply separately men woman . These algorithms use information either out-hospital care ( LTD status , anticancer specific drug , outpatient radiotherapy session ) , inpatient stay ( primary relate diagnosis cancer , cancer-related procedure ) combine information . The incidence rate obtain algorithm definition compare national incidence rate indirect age sex standardization . National incidence rate obtain FRANCE CANCER INCIDENCE ET MORTALITE ( FRANCIM ) : French network cancer registry collect cancer case since 1975 21 French registry ( general specific ) cover 17 95 French metropolitan department . The recent estimation FRANCIM network publish 2012 include cancer location ( C00-C97 ) exclude non-melanoma skin cancer ( C44 ) . Follow All patient include follow January 1 , 2012 occurrence first death , cancer occurrence , move general insurance scheme January 1 , 2013 . To allow comparison data cancer registry , malignant neoplasm consider : ICD-10 code ( C00-C97 ) , exclude non-melanoma skin cancer ( C44 ) . Statistical analysis The number incident cancer case obtain algorithm compare expect number cancer case calculate use national estimation age sex stratum . The standardized incidence ratio ( SIR ) 95 % confidence interval calculate indirect age sex standardization . Age- sex-specific incident rate compare incident rate 2012 estimate FRANCIM . The investigator also apply accurate algorithm separately men woman 3 common cancer correspond gender restrict involved cancer code , procedure drug related cancer interest . The investigator also restrict population most-studied age group cancer etiological study ( 40 75 year ) . All analysis perform use SAS Enterprise Guide , version 4.3 . ''</detailed_description>
