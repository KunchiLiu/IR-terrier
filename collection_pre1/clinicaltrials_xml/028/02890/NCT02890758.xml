	<brief_summary>The purpose study find number natural killer ( NK ) cell non-HLA matched donor safely infused patient cancer . NK cell form lymphocytes defend cancer cell . NK cell cancer patient work well fight cancer . In study , NK cell donate healthy individual without cancer `` match '' human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) gene patient . After receive NK cell , patient may also give drug call ALT803 . ALT803 protein keep NK cell alive , help grow number support cancer-fighting characteristic . HLA-unmatched NK cell infusion investigational ( experimental ) process approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Universal Donor NK Cell Therapy Combination With ALT803</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine maximum tolerate dose ex vivo expand non-HLA match donor NK cell combination ALT-803 Secondary Objectives : - Describe safety profile / toxicity combine ALT-803 NK cell adoptive therapy . - Determine antitumor activity allogeneic NK cell ALT-803 support . - Determine lymphocyte deplete regimen adequate prevent early elimination HLA-mismatched donor NK cell host T-cells . Study Design : This phase I study `` 3+3 '' design three plan dose level NK cell fix dose ALT-803 . Three patient enrol sequentially dose level , start dose level 1 . Patients segregate either receive ALT803 cytokine support NK cell infusion ( start dose level Level 1 ) cytokine administration . Patients arm receive ALT803 either hematologic malignancy patient ( Cohort A ) Colon/Soft tissue sarcoma patient ( Cohort B ) . Absence dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) DLT assessment period 28 day must document patient enrol cell dose without ALT803 next cohort patient receive cytokine dose level enrol . Patients also enrol parallel next cell dose level without cytokine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologic confirmation relapse refractory hematologic malignancy , locally advanced metastatic colon/rectal carcinoma , refractory and/or relapse soft tissue sarcoma fail least one standard line therapy . Patients eligible either decline standard treatment regimens standard approach curative salvage therapy per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline set relapsed/refractory disease . In addition , patient potential 28day delay treatment interfere subject 's potential therapeutic option eligible per treat physician 's discretion . Malignancies include : Acute myeloid leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Chronic myeloid leukemia Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Non Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma Myeloproliferative syndromes Plasma cell myeloma Colon/rectal carcinoma Soft tissue sarcoma include limit Ewing 's sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma Patients must recover acute toxicity prior chemotherapy stem cell transplant . Any prior nonhematologic vital organ toxicity ( cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , renal ) previous therapy must resolve grade 1 less . All previous chemotherapy radiation must complete least 3 week prior study entry . Immunologic therapy must complete least 1 week prior study entry . Patients prior stem cell transplant must great 365 day posttransplant .

Women childbearing age must document negative pregnancy test prior start lymphodepleting regimen . Subjects receive investigational agent . Subjects potential 28day delay treatment interfere subject 's potential therapeutic option . Patients untreated malignant involvement central nervous system ( CNS ) exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Head image necessary document absence CNS involvement patient colon/rectal cancer soft tissue sarcoma . Patients hematologic malignancy undergo treatment malignant involvement CNS must evidence residual disease image CSF sample prior study enrollment . History allergic reaction chemotherapy agent use protocol part lymphodepletion regimen ( Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide ) Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
