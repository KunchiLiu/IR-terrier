	<brief_summary>Genetic abnormality focal epilepsy well know . A novel gene ( DEPDC5 ) identify , associate various genotype epilepsy . Recently , DEPDC5 mutation identify also inside focal cortical dysplasia . This could suggest somatic mutation DEPDC5 could responsible cortical dysplasia . The study aim identify various genetic mutation responsible drug-resistant focal epilepsy due Focal cortical dysplasia child undergo surgery epilepsy due focal cortical dysplasia Rothschild Foundation , Paris . Patients parent recruit identify genetic abnormality lymphocytic cortical DNA .</brief_summary>
