	<criteria>1 . Criteria reach : That patient operate , consider degenerative aortic stenosis , patient diagnose aortic stenosis ( aortic area &lt; 1 cm ) without obvious cause find . 2. criterion meet Strictly normal aortic valve ultrasound 65yearold patient . All patient fit two category consider unknown phenotype use binding assay . In particular , presence aortic sclerosis even moderate aortic regurgitation consider potentially incipient form aortic stenosis , patient type anomaly scan family analyzes . Patients sign consent Non degenerative aortic stenosis another cause could find . Among commonly find cause : Bicuspid aortic valve Severe renal impairment Severe Hypercholesterolemia</criteria>
