	<detailed_description>Rationale : New bronchoscopic treatment emphysema show promise clinical trial , improve lung function , exercise capacity possibly survival adopted number centre Netherlands . It important ensure benefit see clinical trial fact reflect clinical practice best use early 'real world ' experience make optimise development use novel therapy . Overall objective : develop national database record bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedures patient emphysema . This desirable audit purpose also important resource research gathering data facilitate collaboration . Study design : This study nationwide , multicenter , observational post-marketing study long-term follow ( 5 year ) . Study population : The study population exist patient severe emphysema undergo bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment one-way endobronchial valve . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter assessment Target Lung Volume Reduction ( TLVR ) correct placement valve CT-scan 30 day post treatment . This accurate directly treatment related endpoint also use quality control .</detailed_description>
