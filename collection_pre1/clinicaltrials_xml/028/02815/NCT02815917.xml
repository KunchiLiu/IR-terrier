	<brief_summary>Preclinical work suggest D3 dopamine receptor may important study pathophysiology affective disorder , psychotic disorder addiction . D3 receptor may also play role dystonia , Parkinson 's disease response treatment disorder . However , lack specific radioligands image D3 receptor . This propose protocol evaluate uptake [ 18F ] FTP specific vivo measure D3 receptor bind brain healthy volunteer subject injection lorazepam v placebo , cocaine-dependent subject . Test-retest scan evaluate variability [ 18F ] FTP uptake measure healthy volunteer subject cocaine-dependent subject .</brief_summary>
