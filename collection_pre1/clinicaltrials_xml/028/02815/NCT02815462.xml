	<brief_summary>In early study use electronic health record ( EHR ) , investigator identify nine factor significantly associate FA risk . These nine predictor include Furosemide intravenous 40 milligram ; Admissions past one year ; Medifund status ; Frequent emergency department use ; Anti-depressants treatment past one year ; Charlson comorbidity index ; End Stage Renal Failure dialysis ; Subsidized ward stay Geriatric patient . The investigator combine nine predictor FAM-FACE-SG score FA risk ( defined 3 inpatient admission follow 12 month ) . The FAM-FACE-SG risk score advantage deploy hospital 's enterprise data repository know Electronic Health Intelligence System eHINTs short , real-time near real-time basis . On daily basis , data multiple data source extract , transform load onto eHINTS system . The system program run every midnight provide risk score follow morning patient admit previous day . In trial , intervention combine FAM-FACE-SG risk score addition decision make algorithm guide referral various transitional care service base needs assessment nursing function . The primary objective evaluate impact intervention improve healthcare utilization ( hospital readmission , emergency department ( ED ) attendance , length stay 90 day post-discharge ) .</brief_summary>
