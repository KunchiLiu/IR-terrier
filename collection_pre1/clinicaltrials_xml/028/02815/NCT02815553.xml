	<brief_summary>Currently , surgical removal remain main clinical treatment cardiac tumor patient . However , malignant tumor hard completely resect . Also , thoracoscopic surgery induce great operation trauma , patient tolerate take operation . Therefore , new method technique urgent need . Our center 12-year experience intervention treatment solid tumor conduct several animal experiment verify effectiveness transthoracic puncture ablation radiofrequency ablation ventricular muscle . The purpose study conduct new method direct transthoracic cardiac tumor-targeted Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Laser induce Interstitial Thermotherapy ( LITT ) , make minimally invasive treatment plan cardiac tumor patient , verify safety validity intervention treatment long term .</brief_summary>
