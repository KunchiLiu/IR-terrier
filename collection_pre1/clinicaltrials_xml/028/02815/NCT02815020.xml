	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Implement Agency Healthcare Research Quality SMS Resources Tools ( SMS Library/Toolkit ) across four participate network 16 practice use Boot Camp Translation stepped-wedge design . Specific Aim 2 : Assess impact implementation practice staff patient engage chronic care management . Specific Aim 3 : Identify factor relate successful implementation . Background Significance : With almost one-half Americans project least one chronic condition 2020 paramount health care system reduce burden primary care disease management facilitating development activate , informed individual proficient self-management skill . This represent significant cultural shift health management , clinicians staff may lack confidence introduce promote self-management support ( SMS ) . In fact , SMS area disease management least often implemented challenge integrate usual care . This difficulty occur patient clinician level . Using Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) , Hibbard colleague find 60 % patient feel passive manage health third patient barrier knowledge confidence caring . The chronic care model describe SMS one six key pillar provide effective primary care . A systematic review Chronic Care Model apply diabetes care find although single component care model emerge essential , 19 20 intervention include self-management component result improved process outcomes care . Under patient-centered medical home ( PCMH ) model , primary care practice move team-based care care coordination , put patient center care model . Primary care practice begin provide care coordination service , identify train care manager deliver care complex patient chronic illness . This show cost-effective high degree patient acceptance . The four Practice-Based Research Networks ( PBRNs ) participate protocol part Meta-network Learning And Research Center ( Meta-LARC ) . In 2012 AHRQ award Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network ( ORPRN ) 5-year award Center Excellence Primary Care Practice-based Research Learning . This support enable ORPRN establish collaborative center participate PBRNs , use center infrastructure data collection management . Patient involvement progress informing approach knowledge transfer Boot Camp Translation ( BCT ) . BCT provide partnership model patient elbow primary care clinicians staff refine best practice care local level . The study use BCT increase patient skill engagement improve health . It incorporate BCT model finding interpretive- theory-based lens Consolidation Framework Implementation Research Theory Planned Behavior , well intermediate outcome measure Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) Clinician Support Patient Activation Measure ( CS-PAM ) , provide foundation clinician , care manager , patient , practice facilitator researcher develop optimal strategy make case self-management skill implement evaluate SMS Library/Toolkit . Using step wedge study design , strategy replicate improved across four PBRNs , result tool process readily reproduce primary care practice . Primary outcome include CS-PAM score baseline , end T2 , T3 , T4 , T5 implementation period . The structure data hierarchical ( individual nest within practice ) longitudinal ( repeat measure individual time ) . This specific aim hypothesis approach use mixed method evaluation . Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) construct assess among practice staff study time period use survey instrument measure intention , attitude , social norm perceive behavior control towards use SMS Library/Toolkit . The direct measure attitude assess mean six item use semantic differential 7-point scale . Six pair adjective use assess Aact : example , `` useful/very useful '' `` responsible/very responsible '' . These adjective follow sentence : `` In context chronic care management , , use item SMS Library/Toolkit would â€¦ '' . Direct measure social norm ( SN ) assess mean three item , assess 7-point scale . Three item include ass direct measure perceive behavioral control ( PBC ) , 7-point response scale . Finally , intention use SMS library/toolkit assess mean three item . The mean composite score item assess TPB construct compute . For variable , positive score indicate respondent express positive evaluation construct . The assessment SMS Library/Toolkit implementation rely multiple data source fully evaluate `` work '' across different practice setting . Semi-structured key informant interview guide practice observation comprise primary data source . Interview observation guide use open-ended question , probe , cue elicit response data key implementation domain : intervention characteristic , outer setting ( external influence ) , internal setting , individual characteristic , implementation process . The semi-structured data supplement closed-ended survey question ( ask in-person self-administered ) question efficiently provide descriptive result use categorical numeric response . This include item related practice demographic ( e.g. , number provider staff , patient population , payer mix ) , individual characteristic ( e.g. , level training , year practice , age ) . This data analyze use Qualitative Comparative Analysis identify specific component within Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) domains important successful implementation Library/Toolkit . Stepped wedge study design Stepped wedge method use test intervention involve community situation traditional randomize control trial method possible . The investigator randomize order BCT process implement within participate PBRN . Each network ' participate practice receive BCT intervention different point along 10-month period . This permit investigators two-month period begin study period practice control state baseline assessment , gradually implement BCT process subsequent eight month .</detailed_description>
