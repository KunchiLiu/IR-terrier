	<brief_summary>This study evaluate feasibility high whey-protein enteral nutrition formula 20 ventilate ICU patient . The primary endpoint study feasibility attain individualized protein target ( ≥1.2 g/kg ideal body weight/day ) 96-hours ICU admission . Secondary endpoint include tolerance efficacy term amino acid response blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time Protein Target Using High Whey Protein Enteral Nutrition Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present pilot study , investigator use high whey-protein nutrition formula first four day ICU admission . The reason use high protein nutrition investigator previously find early high protein intake non-septic non-overfed patient associate low hospital mortality ( Weijs PJM et . al. , Critical Care 2014,18 ) . Furthermore , first day critical illness tolerance full enteral nutrition often diminish . The use high protein nutrition facilitate early high protein intake . The whey protein hydrolyse . Hydrolyzation protein prevents coagulation subsequent solidification digestive tract therefore promote efficient absorption protein . Of nutrition protein , whey protein large leucin content . Leucin crucial muscle protein synthesis . ( Meyer RF , et.al . : BMC Gastroenterol 2015 , 15 ) , ( Marik PE : Ann Intensive Care 2015,5:51 ) Our previous observational data also show early overfeeding associate high mortality , intake 80-100 % measure energy expenditure day 4 ICU admission associate low mortality . ( Weijs PJM et . al. , Critical Care 2014 , 18 ) Therefore , energy target first four day 90 % measure Energy Expenditure ( EE ) . To optimize energy intake , investigator measure EE metabolic monitoring ( Deltatrac® , Datex , Helsinki , Finland ) , If metabolic monitoring available , investigator assess EE ventilator derive VCO2 ( 8.19*VCO2 ) . ( Stapel S , et.al. , Critical Care 2015,19:370 )</detailed_description>
