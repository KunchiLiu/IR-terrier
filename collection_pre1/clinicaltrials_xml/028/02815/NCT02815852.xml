	<brief_title>RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF BREAST BIOPSIES IN WOMEN YOUNGER THAN 40 YEARS OLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer frequent cancer woman lead cause death woman 50 year USA . In Italy , Pool Airtum 2007-2010 figure confirm breast cancer , exclude skin cancer , 29 % cancer diagnose woman lead cause death woman , region active cancer registry . Among woman , breast cancer rank first age group : represent 29 % deaths woman age &lt; 49 year , 23 % woman 50 69 year 16 % woman age &gt; 70 year . The disease uncommon age 30 European Cancer registry detect since 1990 increase incidence breast cancer woman age 40 . For reason important start verify incidence breast cancer age 40 BREAST UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area ( Versilia , Lucca Massa-Carrara ) . Mammography , reference examination prevention woman age 40 , show age evidence efficacy . Ultrasound examination , complementary mammography , generally well tolerated demonstrate efficacy prospective study screen reduce mortality . MRI intravenous contrast medium consider exam high sensitivity identify neoplastic lesion especially young woman . This study therefore aim review retrospectively case breast cancer center belong BREST UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area locate number case allow comparison image characteristic ( ultrasound , mammography mammary MRI available ) breast cancer ass whether woman &lt; 40 year typical image presentation pattern malignancy observe woman &gt; 40 year confirm . In study involve pathological anatomy BREAST UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area ( Massa-Carrara , Versilia , Lucca ) ; Radiology ( Massa-Carrara , Versilia , Lucca ) ; Clinical breast surgery / oncology / radiology three USL ( Massa-Carrara , Versilia , Lucca ) Tuscany North-West Wide Area . Data patient diagnose breast cancer 01/01/2009 31/12/2015 collect start july 2016 publication result take place December 2016.Risk factor , genetic mutation , receptor status , tumor stage , therapy NHL / LH previous breast tumor analyze well . The data stratify : age ( &lt; 30 year , 30-35 year 35-39 year ) , biological parameter histology , stage diagnosis imaging feature . Patients undergo breast biopsy sample represent already select group may susceptible information bias inherent risk factor : reduce bias recover information risk factor breast cancer . 2 ) operator-dependent variability ultrasound image : take account data analysis , well different machine use various hospital diversity reporting method . 3 ) The patient possible correct analysis data exclude , selection bias patient still take account analysis data.The statistical analysis do 1 month , result publish December 2016 .</detailed_description>
