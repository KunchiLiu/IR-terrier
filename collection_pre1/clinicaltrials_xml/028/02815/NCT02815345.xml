	<brief_summary>During resuscitation preterm infant , withdrawal non-invasive ventilation difficult . In recent study child gestational age &lt; 30 week amenorrhea ( SA ) , definitive withdrawal rate first attempt stop non-invasive ventilation 32 % . In study , median number attempt achieve final withdrawal 3 child bear 28 week . The reason wean failure multiple little study . It seem type interface use , mask cannula , influence effectiveness non-invasive ventilation . The nasal lesion induce non-invasive ventilation uncommon , regardless interface use . In recent randomized trial , range 40 % 50 % depend type nasal cannula non-invasive ventilation mode . It case external damage . But assume breakdown cause internal lesion dependent pressure , humidity flow . These factor likely generate nasal obstruction , source intervention nurse aspire nasal passage less traumatic . The nasal cavity often abuse , key role breathing , could involve withdrawal ventilatory failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Objectives Measures Dimensions Nasal Resistance Preterm Term ( MODERN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement nasal cavity dimension carry acoustic rhinometry ( 10 second acquisition ) . Measurement nasal resistance perform rhinomanometry earlier ( minute measure ) . They may make wakefulness sleep since require participation . These measure carry birth every 7 10 day ( age 28 day ) , child still hospitalize . During measurement , heart rate oxygen saturation collect measure sensor transcutaneously .</detailed_description>
