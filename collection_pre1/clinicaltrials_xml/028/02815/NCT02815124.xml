	<brief_summary>Cochlear implant surgically implant device restore ability hear hearing impair . While remarkably successful , even best performer restoration hear level normal listener unusual . Approximately 3 week surgery , cochlear implant activate via map - process individual electrode ( FDA approve cochlear implant 12 22 electrode ) turn stimulus level adjust level comfortable beneficial recipient . At present , standard care mapping procedure perform without knowledge physical location cochlear implant electrodes neural interface . Our team develop new method map use post-operative CT scan image processing specify physical relationship cochlear implant electrodes neural interface allow customized mapping . Using information , investigator deactivate sub-optimally position electrode . The investigator term `` Image-guided Cochlear Implant Programming '' ( IGCIP ) . In prospective fashion , investigator implement IGCIP cochlear implant recipient least 6 month standard care ( SOC ) mapping . The purpose study perform randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) newly activate cochlear implant recipient randomize IGCIP SOC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Image-Guided Cochlear Implant Programming Versus Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 320,000 individual receive cochlear implant ( CIs ) restore hear hearing impaired . Commercially available CIs 12 , 16 , 22 independent electrode ( # dependent manufacturer CI ) cover entire frequency spectrum cochlea 20,000 Hertz ( Hz ) base 200Hz apex . After implantation , audiologists individually adjusts stimulation level electrode follow electrode turn whole frequency spectrum speech appreciate . This know `` standard care '' ( SOC ) programming . While postoperative speech understand significantly well preoperative level , even best performer complain fidelity natural hearing reproduce . Additionally , significant minority achieve poor outcome despite normally function equipment reason unknown likely relate poor neural survival ; however , confirm post-mortem histopathology require accurately document spiral ganglion cell count . In recent year much attention focus interface cochlear implant electrode auditory neuron stimulate . Technological improvement Vanderbilt image process make possible determine location electrode array relationship frequency spectrum cochlea . Using information , investigator develop new method CI program call image-guided cochlear implant programming , IGCIP sub-optimally place electrode turned-off deactivate . Sub-optimally placed electrode define one neighbor electrode closer proximity site neural stimulation . By deactivate sub-optimally position electrode , channel interaction reduce allow clean signal present auditory nerve . The investigator implement strategy 133 CIs post-lingually deafen ( hearing loss ability speak ) adult CI user median use CI 's SOC program 1.3 year ( range 0.3-15.5 ) . When trialing IGCIP , mean word score increase 48.8±23.7 % 53.3±22.8 % correct , mean sentence score increase 62.2±28.5 % 65.0±26.9 % correct . Both find statistically significant . Extracting pre-lingually ( hear loss ability speak ) deafen adult , investigator see word score , 24 133 ( 28 % ) statistically significant improvement 12 133 ( 9 % ) statistically significant decline , remain 97 ( 73 % ) equivocal result . Similarly , sentence score , 36 133 ( 27 % ) statistically significant improvement 24 133 ( 18 % ) statistically significant decline , remain 73 ( 55 % ) equivocal result . Perhaps important metric map patient select long term use - SOC IGCIP . Ninety-six 133 ( 72.1 % ) participant elect keep IGCIP long term use despite prior research show bias CI recipient favor original map new map . And , 28 % elect keep SOC map , process involves risk - deactivate electrode simply reactivate . Given excite prospective finding , investigator propose randomize control trial ( RCT ) newly activate adult CI recipient CI user test audiologist blind program ( SOC IGCIP ) . The investigator hypothesize CI recipient randomize IGCIP improve hearing performance assess word sentence testing .</detailed_description>
