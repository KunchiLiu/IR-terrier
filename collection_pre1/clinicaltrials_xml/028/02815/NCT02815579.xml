	<detailed_description>Despite major advance care treatment live HIV , morbidity mortality among people live HIV/AIDS ( PLHIV ) remain unacceptably high sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , largely due parallel challenge poverty food insecurity . [ 1 ] In Nyanza Region Kenya , 15.1 % adult population infect HIV , [ 2 ] 50 % rural population food insecure , primarily due unpredictable rainfall limited irrigation . [ 3,4 ] The investigator previously show food insecurity delay antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) initiation , reduces ART adherence , contribute bad immunologic virologic outcome , increase morbidity mortality among PLHIV . [ 5-16 ] There increase international recognition improve food security reduce poverty essential component successful global response HIV epidemic . [ 17-21 ] Yet , date study systematically evaluate impact sustainable food security intervention health , economic , behavioral outcome among PLHIV . Agricultural intervention , potential raise income bolster food security , important understudied route sustainably improve nutritional HIV outcome SSA , include Kenya agriculture account &gt; 75 % total workforce , 51 % gross domestic product . [ 22 ] Building investigator successful completion pilot intervention trial Kenya investigator collective experience study structural barrier HIV care SSA , investigator plan test hypothesis multisectoral agricultural microcredit loan intervention improve food security , prevent ART treatment failure , reduce co-morbidities among PLHIV . The investigator ' intervention co-developed KickStart , prominent non-governmental organization ( NGO ) base SSA introduce human-powered pump , enable farmer grow high yield crop year-round . This technology reduce food insecurity poverty 800,000 user 22 country subcontinent since 1991 . [ 23 ] The investigator ' intervention include : ) loan ( ~ $ 175 ) well-established Kenyan bank purchase agricultural implement commodity ; b ) agricultural implement purchase loan include KickStart treadle pump , seed , fertilizer pesticides ; c ) education financial management sustainable farming practice occur set patient support group . This study cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) intervention follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine impact multisectoral agricultural intervention among HIV-infected farmer ART HIV clinical outcome . The investigator hypothesize intervention lead improve viral load suppression ( primary outcome ) change CD4 cell count , physical health status , WHO stage III/IV disease , hospitalization ( secondary outcome ) intervention arm compare control arm . Aim 2 : To understand pathway multisectoral intervention may improve HIV health outcome . Using investigator 's theoretical model , [ 1,24 ] investigator hypothesize intervention improve food security household wealth , turn contribute improve outcome nutritional ( improve diet quality , nutritional status ) , behavioral ( improved ART adherence , retention care ) , mental health ( improve mental health/less depression , improve empowerment ) pathways . Aim 3 : To determine cost-effectiveness intervention obtain information necessary inform scale-up Kenya similar setting SSA . The investigator quantify cost per disability-adjusted life year avert , identify lesson inform successful scale-up . To accomplish Aims 1 &amp; 2 , investigator randomize 8 match pair health facility Nyanza Region 1:1 ratio intervention control arm , enroll 44 participant per facility ( total n=704 ) . All participant follow 2 year . Impacts investigator 's intervention primary health outcome mediator investigate provide definitive data direct indirect intervention effect . To accomplish Aim 3 , investigator : ) conduct cost-effectiveness analysis ; b ) identify characteristic individual likely benefit intervention ( e.g. , gender , educational attainment , family size , wealth , risk tolerance , entrepreneurial ability ) ; c ) perform mixed-methods process evaluation study participant , staff , various stakeholder determine work work guide future scale-up effort intervention . The investigator 's ultimate goal develop test intervention reverse cycle food insecurity HIV/AIDS morbidity mortality SSA .</detailed_description>
