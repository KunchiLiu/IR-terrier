	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery procedure firmly demonstrate lead significant improvement even , many case , complete reversal abnormal glucose homeostasis type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Various surgery procedure perform induce weight loss . The striking anti-diabetic effect observe biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch ( BPD-DS ) , follow Roux-in-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) . The first two procedure induce restriction energy intake low absorption dietary fatty acid latter exclusively target energy intake restriction . The investigator others show improvement T2D occur within day BPD-DS RYGB vast majority patient , prior significant weight loss . This rapid metabolic recovery explain normalization β-cell function meal challenge ameliorate hepatic insulin sensitivity . The investigator others show acute anti-diabetic effect mostly recapitulate matched caloric restriction , independent change gastrointestinal hormone , show importance gastrointestinal-derived energy flux acute diabetes control . Muscle insulin sensitivity , hand , improve slowly association weight loss , demonstrate heterogeneous metabolic response various organ BPD-DS . Some preliminary study also demonstrate rapid reduction NEFA level production rate upon i.v . administration lipid euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp . This rapid improvement NEFA tolerance strongly suggest adipose tissue storage circulate fatty acid also improve rapidly , prior significant weight loss , BPD-DS . It may also suggest acceleration oxidative fatty acid metabolism organ liver , heart and/or skeletal muscle . Studies rapid metabolic change bariatric surgery conduct thus far rapidly improve understanding fundamental pathogenic defect T2D . However , much remain understood acute change gastrointestinal-derived metabolic flux , organ-specific metabolic response bariatric surgery relationship reversal T2D . Using vivo methodological approach , investigator proposes investigate early organ-specific change dietary fatty acid metabolism response BPD-DS vs. SG relation improve systemic change glucose homeostasis , insulin sensitivity β-cell function patient T2D .</brief_summary>
