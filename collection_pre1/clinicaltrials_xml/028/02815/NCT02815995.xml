	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , receive tremelimumab durvalumab vein , 1 hour , every 4 week 16 week ( 4 dos ) . After Week 16 , participant may continue receive durvalumab alone vein 1 hour additional 32 week ( 8 dos ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 Week 0 : - Participant physical exam . - Participant 3 EKGs row . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . If participant become pregnant , part routine blood urine sample use pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2½ tablespoon ) draw biomarker genetic testing . Biomarkers find blood may relate participant 's reaction study drug . The type genetic testing study perform learn participant 's DNA ( genetic material ) may change respond study drug . On Day 1 Weeks 2 6 , blood ( 3½ tablespoon ) draw routine , genetic , biomarker test . On Day 1 Week 4 every 4 week ( Weeks 8 , 12 , 16 , ) Week 44 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant imaging scan . Participant scan Weeks 16 24 . On Day 1 Weeks 10 14 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Length Study : Participant may receive 4 dos durvalumab combination tremelimumab additional 8 dos durvalumab alone . Participant longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If participant complete 12 month therapy disease appear get bad , may able re-start treatment . The study doctor discus participant . It expect patient 's participation study may last 15 month . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : As soon possible participant 's last dose study drug ( ) : - Participant physical exam . - Participant MRI , CT , positron emission compute tomography ( PET ) /CT scan . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker genetic testing . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug ( ) : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month : - Participant MRI , CT , PET/CT scan . - Participant may call learn start anti-cancer treatment . If participant call , take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Durvalumab tremelimumab FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 150 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
