	<brief_summary>The research goal continue add extensive body peer-reviewed evidence demonstrate MRI may safely perform patient cIEDs , evaluate clear cardiology . This study allow researcher collect data facility ongoing clinical practice regard number type adverse clinical reaction , also document change implant cardiac device may occur MRI scan . The researcher also assess result MRI image finding impact patient care clinical outcome patient . This data present FDA Centers Medicare Medicaid Services influence federal guideline payment structure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Of MRI In Patients With Implanted Cardiac Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac implantable electronic device ( cIEDs ) generally refer implanted pacemaker defibrillator patient cardiac disorder affect heart rhythm . Previously , cIEDs regard contraindication magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , concern magnetic field MRI may cause problem patient 's cIED . However , major healthcare issue , approximately 50-75 % patient implanted cIEDs expect need future MRI part clinical care . The inability get test may negatively impact ability diagnose treat future disease . However , many initial concern regard capability perform MRI patient cIED likely overstate . There peer-reviewed literature date back 1990s regard ability safely perform MRI patient cIEDs , certain protocol follow regard patient selection monitoring . In 2011 , Nazarian et al Johns Hopkins University publish study 438 patient cIED receive MRI . There adverse clinical effect study . In fact , American College Radiology update 's guidance document Safe MR Practices , cIEDs longer list relative contraindication obtain MRI . However , presence cIEDs still regard relative contraindication perform MRI center . In addition , performance MRI set cIED deny Centers Medicare Medicaid Services . Continued accrual data regard safety perform MRI patient cIEDs need , include outcome study document clinical impact improve diagnostics provide MRI patient care .</detailed_description>
