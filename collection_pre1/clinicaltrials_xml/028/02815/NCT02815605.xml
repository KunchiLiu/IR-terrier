A retrospective analysis whole cohort parturients 2009-2015 Tampere University Hospital make assess risk factor severe PPH ( ie . estimate blood loss 1500ml delivery ) examine possible change blood transfusion strategy effect bleeding ( example , implementation massive transfusion protocol , amount blood product use , effect red blood cell : fresh-frozen plasma ratio , use pharmacological agent coagulation management , introduction new angiological surgical technique etc . ) complication , laboratory parameter patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors , Management Complications Severe Post-partum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-partum haemorrhage ( PPH ) still remain one leading cause morbidity obstetric population recent report United Kingdom reveal hemorrhage sixth important direct cause maternal mortality . During labor , blood flow uterus increase obstetric hemorrhage may quickly turn massive bleeding require massive transfusion allogeneic blood product . Although introduction massive transfusion protocol ( MTP ) may improve survival trauma patient , administration allogeneic blood product , although life-saving , also associate considerable side effect . That stepwise progressive approach implementation treatment protocol describe timely use different pharmacological agent surgical radiological intervention call . Risk factor blood transfusion ( surrogate marker PPH ) delivery Finland recently study , result seem consonance report several developed country , demonstrate mark increase incidence PPH . However , cause increase postpartum hemorrhage remain least partly unclear . Also , complication rate blood transfusion adverse outcomes treatment obstetric patient severe bleed recently study ( 19 ) . Identification PPH risk factor , change transfusion strategy surgical technique implementation holistic treatment protocol may effect complication rate , cost total amount blood product usage bleeding , investigator ' knowledge , underreported current studies.That seem justified examine cohort parturients severe PPH long time span find whether change practice reflect patient ' outcome . From 2009 December 2015 , patient mark post-partum hemorrhage ( estimate blood loss 1500ml ) track Tampere University hospital 's computerized perinatal database ( iPana ) . Approximate number patient 900 : accord database , incidence severe PPH hospital 130-160/year . General patient characteristic record : age , weight , height , parity , gestational age , previous delivery cesarean section , chronic disease , complication medication pregnancy . The mode delivery , labour characteristic ( duration , interval PROM delivery , chorioamnionitis ) , use uterotonic agent diagnose obstetric disease record ( e.g . placental abnormality ) . Laboratory parameter treatment PPH collect : baseline aPTT , PT ( INR ) , Fibrinogen concentration , ATIII , Hb , platelet count respective ( low ) value treatment PPH blood gas analysis information , especially low base excess lactate low ca-ion . Other possible factor affect hemostasis body temperature , hemodynamic parameter resuscitation surgical treatment search medical record . Total amount bleed allogeneic blood product , fibrinogen concentrate , prothrombin complex concentrate , FXIII recombinant factor VII consumption record primary end point . As secondary endpoint , number emergency hysterectomy , intensive care admission , transfusion-related side effect thromboembolic complication study recorded 30 day delivery . The investigator ' aim identify risk factor severe PPH ( ie . estimate blood loss 1500ml delivery ) examine possible change blood transfusion strategy effect bleeding ( example , implementation massive transfusion protocol , amount blood product use , effect red blood cell : fresh-frozen plasma ratio , use pharmacological agent coagulation management , introduction new angiological surgical technique etc . ) complication , laboratory parameter patient outcome .</detailed_description>
