	<brief_summary>Medical researcher National Heart Centre Singapore carry state-of-the-art study examines possibility change patient ' cell multi-functional potent stem cell call iPS cell . These iPS cell subsequently give rise functional cardiac cell ( myocytes ) cardiovascular cell might give clue manifestation structural heart disease . This study involve blood sample collection pre-screening skin biopsy establish skin cell culture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants invite participate study diagnose Marfan 's syndrome whereby gene mutation suspect affected major blood vessel heart Fontan procedure carry re-direct blood flow heart . This study recruit 30 subject National Heart Centre Singapore period 1 year . For clinically diagnose Marfan disease , genetic test gene call FBN1 carry confirm presence gene mutation suspect cause disease . It important know research find indicate presence gene mutation may suggest pre-disposition Marfan disease , definitely ascertain gene cause disease predict develop disease . Further independent clinical genetic testing may make available , desire consulting doctor genetic counsellor . The skin obtain course study use study store analysed purpose study , period exceed 5 year research study experimental transplant study , destroy completion study , unless agree donate sample National Heart Centre Singapore continuous storage future study approve Institutional review board . The blood however store indefinitely National Heart Centre future research molecular , image outcome study cardiovascular health disease .</detailed_description>
