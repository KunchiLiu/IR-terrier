	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate influence 16 week progressive barefoot run train impact force muscle activation habitual shod runner . Habitual shod runner test barefoot ( BF ) shod ( SH ) , 16 week progressive barefoot run training . Tests consist run instrument treadmill 9 km/h , 10 minute experimental condition . Nine data acquisition ( 10 ) vertical ground reaction force ( VGRF ) electromyographic ( EMG ) signal conduct experimental condition , test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>16 Weeks Progressive Barefoot Running Training Changes Impact Force Muscle Activation Habitual Shod Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short-term effect barefoot simulate barefoot run widely discuss recent year . Consequences adopt barefoot run long period , e.g . training strategy , still remain unknown . The present study evaluate influence 16 week progressive barefoot run train impact force muscle activation habitual shod runner . Habitual shod runner test barefoot ( BF ) shod ( SH ) , 16 week progressive barefoot run training . During 16 week training , participant keep normal run training routine ( wear shoe ) , introduce progressively BF condition . Three training session perform per week . Barefoot training start 5 % end 20 % weekly training volume ( WTV ) perform without shoe . Soft surface ( i.e . sand grass ) adopt begin training ( week 1 8 ) . From week 9 16 , participant mixed soft harder surface , treadmill asphalt , accomplish training . Training session prepared professional , research participant together . All training session supervise researcher . Tests consist run instrument treadmill 9 km/h , 10 minute experimental condition . Each session test start participant perform maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) test muscle interest . The MVIC protocol consist 4 movement trial muscle : 2 submaximal trial 10 second ; 1 maximal trial 5 second ; 1 maximal trial 10 second . Then , 5-minute period warm-up self-selected speed perform treadmill . After , participant run ( 9km/h ) 10 minute instrument treadmill barefoot shod condition . Participants 2-minute interval trial experimental condition change . The VGRF legs EMG signal tibialis anterior ( TA ) , gastrocnemius lateralis ( GL ) , long head biceps femoris ( BCF ) , rectus femoris ( RF ) vastus lateralis ( VL ) right leg volunteer obtain . These muscle choose due importance contribution run . For shod trial , runner wear habitual running shoe . All shoe good condition use similar characteristic construction .</detailed_description>
