	<brief_summary>The CARDIOFLOW study compare standard test , pressure wire test call fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) , new method base take detailed `` 3D '' ECG call Cardiogoniometry ( CGM ) . FFR angiographic technique measure physiological significance coronary stenosis trial data show basing management decision data improves prognosis . However FFR study expensive invasive , whereas CGM painless simply involve place 4 sticky pad patient 's chest / back similar ECG ( heart trace ) . The investigator want see whether use new method find whether treatment coronary angioplasty would benefit . If , future , clinician could use method ( CGM ) rather pressure wire assessment ( FFR ) . This would several advantage ; particular , easily perform clinic avoids need use expensive pressure wire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Efficacy CARDIOgoniometry ( CGM ) Determine Physiologically Significant Stenosis Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease Comparison Fractional FLOW Reserve - CARDIOFLOW</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim test hypothesis cardiogoniometry ( CGM ) helpful identify physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis comparison fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . Last year UK 202 098 patient underwent coronary angiography determine whether significant coronary artery disease . However , well recognise , even orthogonal view , angiography limit term ability determine functional importance coronary lesion . In particular lesion judge 50-70 % stenosed may necessarily cause ischaemia depend factor lesion length , importantly , size territory supply vessel . There several study demonstrate clinical utility evaluate lesion FFR . The measurement FFR index physiological significance coronary stenosis define ratio maximal blood flow stenotic artery normal maximal flow . It calculate compare ratio aortic pressure pressure distal coronary stenosis maximal hyperaemia . These pressure measure introduce coronary pressure guide wire artery hyperaemia induce give infusion adenosine intravenously . An FFR ratio &lt; 0.80 indicates coronary stenosis cause significant ischaemia would benefit PCI . This since incorporate ESC clinical guideline myocardial revascularisation . However invasive procedure pressure wire relatively expensive compare standard angioplasty wire . On contrary , CGM cheap non-invasive technique easily apply . The aim propose study ass whether CGM may able aid clinician identify coronary stenosis physiologically significant induce myocardial ischaemia conjunction standard coronary angiography . CGM form 3D vector electrocardiography provide quantitative analysis myocardial depolarisation repolarisation . It show sensitive specific standard 12-lead ECG diagnose stable coronary artery disease . Furthermore , work show CGM sensitive 12-lead ECG detecting patient ACS . More recently 2012 , work find CGM sensitive specific 12 lead ECG identify abnormal myocardial perfusion scan ( MPS ) . FFR validity initially base comparison MPS therefore hypothesise CGM may comparable FFR .</detailed_description>
