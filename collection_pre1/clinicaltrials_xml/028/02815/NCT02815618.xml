	<detailed_description>The BabyLux project aim provide precise , accurate , robust device continuously monitor cerebral oxygen metabolism blood flow critically ill newborn infant . This achieve combining time resolve near-infrared spectroscopy ( TRS ) newly develop diffuse correlation spectroscopy ( DCS ) single device . The innovative aspect project relate use advanced solution , base state-of-the-art photonic component , already test laboratory clinical test adult . Time Resolved Near-infrared spectroscopy Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy The propose solution integrate two advance photonic technique , TRS DCS . Both technique rely use optical fibre probe ( sensor ) illuminate low power near-infrared light scalp collect diffusively reflect optical signal propagate scalp skull , therefore carry information deeper cortical region . The different absorption spectrum oxygenate deoxygenated haemoglobin near-infrared range allow non-invasive monitoring two specie cortical tissue . TRS DCS prototypes available technically test laboratory setting successfully validate preclinical trial adult volunteer patient . Measured TRS/DCS parameter TRS measure attenuation temporal broadening relatively short light pulse ( pulse duration ~100 p ) diffusive medium ( e.g . neonate 's head ) . TRS ability resolve path-lengths ( equivalently time-of-flights ) photon propagate tissue . This enable TRS separate absorption scatter coefficient allow absolute measurement , utilize time-gating path-lengths emphasize signal deep tissue . This particularly important separate intra- extra-cerebral signal brain monitoring . DCS rely fact temporal correlation light field turbid medium also obey diffusion equation , albeit slightly different one use TRS . Thus DCS share light penetration advantage TRS , , since DCS explicitly measure red blood cell movement , provide direct measure quantities cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . The specific combination DCS TRS allow assessment cerebral oxygen metabolism CBF complete ( i.e . CBF oxygenation simultaneously independently provide ) , accurate ( i.e . base absolute measurement optical parameter ) robust ( i.e . potentially less affected artefact relate superficial systemic activity sensor/head movement ) way . The aim study perform clinical measurement use BabyLux instrument different clinical real-life setting validate new technology term feasibility , repeatability measurement , user friendliness neonatal medicine . The BabyLux system test four different real-life setting measure : 1 . The increase oxygenation change blood flow minute birth specify expect range measurement ; 2 . The precision repeatability measurement reapplying NIRS sensor several time slightly different site head relatively steady condition ; 3 . The cerebral vaso-reactivity arterial carbon dioxide tension mechanically ventilate newborn monitor induce change cerebral blood flow ; 4 . The user-friendliness loss signal routine care situation ( e.g . 24-hour monitoring neonate undergo intensive care ) .</detailed_description>
