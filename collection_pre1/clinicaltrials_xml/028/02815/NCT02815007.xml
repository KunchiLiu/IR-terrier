	<brief_title>Chidamide With EGFR-TKI Advanced EGFR-TKI-resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>( 1 ) The efficacy regimen evaluate objective remission rate , disease control rate , progress free survival , duration remission , overall survival , time progression . Safety monitor vital sign , blood routine test , liver function , kidney function electrolytes level , ECG , cardiac ultrasonography . All data document CRF form , carefully preserve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Stage IIIB/IV nonsmall cell lung carcinoma EGFR 19/21 point mutation , verify histology cytology . 2 . Achieved remission ( CR PR ) previous EGFRTKI treatment ; achieve stable disease ( SD ) ≥ 6 month previous EGFRTKI treatment ; disease progression emerge follow EGFRTKI treatment ( within past 30 day ) ; treatment employ withdrawn EGFRTKI . 3 . Age ≥18 year , male female ; 4 . Has least 1 measurable focus accord RECIST criterion 1.1 , treat radiotherapy . 5 . General condition ECOG 02 , expect survival ≥ 3 month . 6 . Organ function fit follow : Bone marrow : absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109/L , platelet ≥100 × 109/L , Hb ≥ 90g/L ; Liver : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time normal maximum , ALT AST≤ 2.5 time normal maximum . ( ALT/AST≤ 5 time normal maximum patient infiltrative liver disease ) Coagulation : INR PT ˂ 1.5 fold normal maximum ; Serum creatinine ˂ 1.5 fold normal maximum ; creatinine clearance rate ≥50ml/min ( calculate CockroftGault10 formula ) , underweight patient , whose result differ largely two formula , method creatinine clearance rate calculation employ , like EDTA method , inulin clearance method 24 hour urine analysis . 7 . For patient metastatic brain disease , symptom well control regional therapy ( surgery radiotherapy ) , need hormone maintenance therapy . 8 . For fertile woman , urine blood pregnancy test negative within 7 day prior treatment , patient ( male female ) contraceptive measure whole treatment period 4 week treatment ; willing sign write consent enrol trial , adhere treatment follow protocol . 1 . Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma treat EGFRTKI . 2 . Patients take unauthorized medicine medicine trial within 30 day 1st day trial . 3 . Patients active hemorrhage new thrombotic disorder , take anticoagulation drug hemorrhagic tendency . 4 . History surgery visceral organ within 6 week trial . 5 . Patients ' organ condition : Metastatic brain/ meningeal disorder ( except whose symptom well control regional therapy , need hormone maintenance therapy ) . Patients history mesenchymal lung disease , druginduced mesenchymal disease , hormonerequired radiation pneumonia , idiopathic lung fibrosis baseline CT scan , uncontrolled massive pleural effusion pericardial effusion . Patients evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( like unstable noncompensated respiratory/cardiac/hepatic/renal disease ) , accord judgment researcher . Any unstable systemic disease ( include ˃ CTCAE 2 active clinical infection , level IV hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , congestive heart failure , QT interval ˃450ms , HIV infection , metabolic liver kidney disease ) ; History malignant tumor within 5 year prior trial . Definitive history neural mental disorder , include seizure dementia . Patients xenogenic organ transplantation , patient severe injury massive surgery 4 week prior 1st dosage admission medicine trial . 6 . Women pregnancy lactation . 7 . Allergic constitution , like allergic ≥2 food drug , allergic component medicine use trial ; 8 . Any condition impair patient ' ability swallow , condition impairs drug absorption drug kinetic parameter , include kind gastrointestinal resection surgery ; 9 . Patients drug abuse , medical , psychological , social condition may impair trial process evaluation result trial ; 10 . Any condition may influence safety compliance patient . 11 . Patients researcher think appropriate regimen trial .</criteria>
