	<brief_summary>Cholera , rapidly dehydrate watery diarrheal disease transmit water food contaminate bacterium , Vibrio cholerae , major cause morbidity mortality low income country like Bangladesh . In country , Cholera disease burden consist cholera outbreaks endemic cholera comprise least 300,000 severe case 1.2 million infection year . To combat situation , Vaccination cholera prove effective endemic epidemic setting . But , WHO recommend Dukoral Prequalified Shanchol quite expensive country perspective . Therefore , locally manufacture OCV improve cost effectiveness make affordable . The hypothesis proposal Locally produce orally administer whole cell inactivate HL-OCV test formulation A B safe immunogenic adult child Bangladesh compare ShancholTM . The result study allow u understand safety immunogenicity outcome HL-OCV compare Shanchol vaccine . The total sample size 840 healthy participant . 840 healthy participant ( 360 adult , 240 Children Adolescent 240 young child ) 18-45 year , 5- less 18 year 1 year less 5 year enrol study . Children whose parents/guardians give voluntary consent enrol study . The investigator provide 2 dose vaccine three group 14 day interval . Test formulation locally manufacture comparator group get Shanchol . The Investigators propose collect three blood sample ( Day 0 , 14 28 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Locally Manufactured New ( HL-OCV ) Oral Cholera Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cholera continue major cause morbidity mortality low income country include Bangladesh . It estimate least 300,000 severe case 4,500 death Bangladesh year1 . The overall morbidity cholera remain high . A global stockpile OCV create WHO 2013 epidemic outbreak settings30 . However , global demand vaccine far exceed present supply epidemic also endemic settings3 . It envision local production affordable OCV high risk population endemic setting improve present scenario Bangladesh country . Knowledge gap : The WHO recommend OCV use endemic epidemic cholera settings4 . At present two vaccine WHO prequalified . These include Dukoral register Bangladesh 50 country . However , disadvantage use Dukoral current price expensive Bangladesh develop country . In addition , need buffer formulate vaccine make less fieldable mass vaccination programs.Another whole kill OCV , ShancholTM , WHO prequalified , base similar bacterial component Dukoral license India Bangladesh . Although vaccine relatively affordable may sufficiently cost effective Government Bangladesh implement poor endemic setting . At present , vaccine short supply able meet global demand . In order increase supply OCV make vaccine affordable , MSD Wellcome Trust Hilleman Labs . Pvt . Ltd collaboration Goteberg University , Sweden engineer new oral cholera vaccine HL-OCV , consist formaldehyde-inactivated recombinant V.cholerae strain , MS 1568 express Ogawa Inaba antigens . The vaccine formulation quantify total O1 lipopolysaccharide , LPS content match ShancholTM , less 600 mcg/ml LPS O1 ; Formulation A high Shanchol , less 900 mcg/ml LPS O1 ; Formulation B . The vaccine technology transfer local manufacturer , INCEPTA Bangladesh . Relevance : The study locally manufacture new HL-OCV , among child adult able give u information regard safety immunogenicity two different formulation vaccine , base LPS content . The study identify safe formulation among two formulation A B , also able show superiority high LPS formulation naive population child 1-5 year age . Results study able identify select suitable formulation Phase II study licensure Bangladesh . This study pave way forward field study could establish field efficacy vaccine compare exist vaccine Bangladesh . Hypothesis : Locally produce orally administer whole cell inactivate HL-OCV test formulation A B safe immunogenic adult child Bangladesh compare Shanchol TM . Objectives : The objective study determine safe immunogenic formulation new oral cholera vaccine HL-OCV , compare license vaccine ShancholTM .</detailed_description>
