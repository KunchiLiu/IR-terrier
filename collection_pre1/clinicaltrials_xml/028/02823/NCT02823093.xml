	<brief_summary>The vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) necessary drug prevention treatment thrombo-embolic disease . The AVKAL study assess impact VKA treatment aortic calcification development . This biomedical research without health product , transversal monocentric study compare aortic calcification level two population : one treat VKA never treat VKA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Calcification Vitamin K Antagonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vitamin K antagonists exercise anticoagulant effect prevent vitamin K dependant gamma-carboxylation coagulation II , VII , IX X factor form final step activation . They inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase VKORC1 enzyme , responsible vitamin K epoxide recycle vitamin K hydroquinone ( reduced form ) . The carboxylation also inhibit Matrix Gla protein ( MGP ) , inhibitor factor vascular calcification . Warfarin ( use VKA word level ) employ animal produce vascular calcification inhibit MGP activation . Epidemiologic data indicate warfarin could increase calcification cardiac valve coronary artery . However , study interest abdominal aorta 's calcification consider like important marker cardiovascular risk concern fluindione use VKA France . Even class effect seem logical , investigator ca n't dismiss local effect , different warfarin . In study , calcification assessment rarely quantitative MGP level measure . The vascular calcification constitute potential adverse effect VKA could limit benefit certain population . In work assumption aortic calcification level upper patient receive VKA patient receive VKA aortic calcification increase owe non-activation MGP . The main objective ass take VKA associate aortic calcification development patient receive VKA . Investigators compare 2 population : one group treat VKA treatment least 6 month one focus group never treat VKA treatment .</detailed_description>
