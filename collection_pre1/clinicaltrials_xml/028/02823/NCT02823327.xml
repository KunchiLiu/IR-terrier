	<brief_title>Clinical Factors Gene Expression Analysis Prognosis Tissue Samples From Patients With AIDS-Related Primary Effusion Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify baseline clinical characteristic treatment strategy patient AIDS-associated primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) correlate long-term survival ( &gt; = 2 year ) . ( Primary clinical objective ) II . Identify differentially express gene PEL associate long-term survival ( &gt; = 2 year ) . ( Primary genomic objective ) OUTLINE : Medical chart review perform patient information collect regard human immunodeficiency virus human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) /AIDS medical history , stag AIDS related malignancy , type treatment . Previously collect tissue sample analyze via ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequence microarray .</detailed_description>
