	<brief_title>Proadrenomedullin Early Risk Assessment Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergency department ( ED ) become increasingly over-crowded , patient face prolonged wait time . This aggravated shortage available hospital space . Therefore , safe rapid triaging patient essential improve workflow within ED , maximize patient safety comfort , alleviate unnecessary financial burden healthcare provider . Adrenomedullin ( ADM ) , 52 amino acid peptide , member calcitonin peptide family widely express many tissue organ . It show variety physiological function , include immune-modulating , direct bactericidal , diuretic potent vasodilatory activity . In healthy subject , ADM circulate low picomolar concentration . In many pathological state hypertension , renal failure , low respiratory disease septic shock , plasma level adrenomedulin significantly up-regulated proportion disease severity . These unique property make potentially useful marker determination patient risk develop complication admission ED , order rapidly triage administer effective treatment short possible time . However , reliable measurement ADM challenge due number issue , : short half time 22 minute ; rapid degradation protease ; bind complement factor H. Therefore , increase stability precursor molecule , Mid-Regional ( MR ) -proADM , allow reliably measure surrogate biomarker unstable ADM 1:1 ratio . The aim study assessment MR-proADM novel biomarker provide accurate short- , mid- long term prognostic information triage multi-dimensional risk assessment patient ED set . ADM , present mainly endothelial vascular smooth muscle cell , act hormone cytokine ( often term `` hormokine ) autocrine paracrine manner . Its potent vasodilatory hypotensive response elicit initial increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate level , subsequent production nitric oxide . The importance ADM homeostasis illustrate central role up- down- regulation cytokine mediator , well stimulatory inhibitory effect cytokine production . Indeed , interleukin ( IL ) -1β tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFα ) two potent trigger ADM production . It also up-regulated hypoxia , bacterial product , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , shear stress . Moreover , ADM potent antimicrobial action membrane channel formation lysis , anti-apoptotic property , enhances renal excretion sodium , decrease aldosterone synthesis increase renal blood flow urine volume . The ubiquitous important functional role ADM result clinical use many diverse indication . Its precursor molecule , MR-proADM , show powerful risk assessment marker sepsis lower respiratory tract infection ability predict 30 day mortality regardless underlying diagnosis . Plasma concentration MR-proADM also show elevated myocardial infarction , correlate severity acute chronic heart failure . Furthermore , show outperforms BNP NT-BNP predict mortality ED patient dyspnea 30 days8-12 . MR-proADM also elevate various type glomerulonephritis progressively increased patient chronic renal failure ( CKD ) great predictive accuracy determine risk CKD progression , compare standard GFR measurement . MR-proADM determine plasma EDTA sample automate immunofluorescent assay ( Thermo ScientificTM BRAHMSTM MR-proADM KRYPTORTM ) . Healthy individual detectable level MR-proADM approximately 0.4nmol/L . The functional assay sensitivity assess 0.25 nmol/L . Levels MR-proADM influence food water intake significant gender-related difference , optimize use risk assessment . Furthermore , remain stable 72 hour EDTA plasma room temperature four freeze/ thaw cycle . In previous study , algorithm validate use MR-proADM cut-off value together clinical risk assessment ED physician . The application model could potentially lead increase patient safely discharge hospital fall low risk category . It show prognostic information model could enhance appropriateness disposition decision patient present ED non-specific complaint ( NSC ) .</detailed_description>
