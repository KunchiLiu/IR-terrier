	<brief_summary>Myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) clonal hematopoietic disorder share common natural evolution : chronic phase , characterize major risk vascular event , follow accelerated phase eventually leading transformation acute leukemia . MPN include polycythemia vera , essential thrombocythemia , primary myelofibrosis , rarer entity . During past year , CML become paradigm target therapy personalized cancer medicine . For MPNs , discovery JAK2V617F mutation follow many mutation , open similar perspective . However , several question remain answered MPNs regard clinical implication major scientific discovery : clinical impact JAK2V617F molecular biomarkers risk complication progression ? Can new biomarkers use perspective personalized therapy MPNs ? project focus qualification series know mutation biomarkers MPNs base large multicenter cohort patient well-annotated sample</brief_summary>
