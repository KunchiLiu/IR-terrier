	<detailed_description>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ( NCGS ) recently include among gluten-related disease . Patients suffer NCGS diagnose carefully exclude celiac disease ( CD ) diagnosis negative CD-specific serum antibody absence intestinal villus atrophy , exclude IgE-mediated wheat allergy , negative serum specific IgE and/or skin prick test wheat antigen . Then , absence sensitive specific diagnostic biomarkers NCGS , monitor patient elimination re-introduction wheat double-blind placebo control ( DBPC ) challenge method suggest diagnostic hallmark . Obviously , cumbersome time-consuming procedure use study . Despite increase percentage general population define `` gluten-sensitive '' , year 2017 market gluten-free product worth 6.6 billion dollar , doubt persist many aspect NCGS . Some study seem suggest wheat component gluten cause symptom , therefore term `` non-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) propose instead NCGS . Furthermore , well know CD long-life condition strict adherence gluten-free diet must maintain , unknown whether valid NCWS . On year 2012 , researcher publish retrospective study , include 276 patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) -like symptom diagnose NCWS use DBPC challenge ten-years period ( 2001-2011 ) . The present prospective study aim evaluate persistence NCWS condition cohort , consequently , researcher estimate : A ) many patient still follow wheat-free diet , B ) percentage still suffer NCWS , diagnose DBPC wheat challenge , subgroup cohort .</detailed_description>
