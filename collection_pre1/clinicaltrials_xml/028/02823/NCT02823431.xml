	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose Study The purpose study determine whether urethral sensory feedback role micturition ( bladder empty ) reflex female control routine office Urodynamic Studies ( UDS ) . UDS current clinical test urethral bladder function consist several individual study include fill cystometry , pressure-flow study , urethral pressure profilometry ( UPP ) . Filling cystometry focus primarily sensation activity bladder filling ( storage ) phase micturition ( void ) cycle . Pressure-flow study ( include void cystometry ) use assess motor activity bladder muscle bladder empty . UPP assess urethral sphincter motor function traditionally use evaluate stress urinary incontinence . Perineal patch electromyography ( EMG ) often add UDS assess pelvic floor muscle recruitment voiding , may suggest void dysfunction . 2 . Background &amp; Significance The storage elimination urine regulate neural circuit brain spinal cord coordinate function urinary bladder urethra . During micturition ( bladder empty ) reflex , elimination urine facilitate bladder wall contraction urethral wall pelvic floor muscle relaxation . Urine subsequently flow urethra also activate sensory nerve amplify bladder contraction maintain efficient bladder empty . Incomplete void urinary retention occur mechanisms disrupt poorly coordinate . Incomplete bladder empty due detrusor underactivity understudy health concern woman United States . The overall incidence detrusor underactivity woman yet report literature . One study Wu et al . ( 2005 ) determine 7.8 % patient outpatient rehabilitation facility symptom incomplete bladder emptying ; whereas , 21 % people without symptom elevate post void residual universally screen . Their population consist 350 patient , two-thirds woman . Lower urinary tract symptom , include urinary urgency , frequency incomplete bladder emptying , show decrease quality life , increase healthcare utilization , decrease workplace productivity , impact intimate relationship . The current clinical management option woman retention intermittent indwell catheterization , urethral dilation , reconstructive surgery . These treatment , however , often fail completely resolve low urinary tract symptom patient may develop chronic retention complication overflow incontinence , hydroureter , hydronephrosis , infection , renal failure . In order improve therapeutic outcome , still need clarify specific mechanism underlie detrusor underactivity woman . Our propose study contribute grow body literature implicate urethral sensory feedback candidate recover efficient bladder empty . 3 . Hypothesis Justification Overall Hypothesis : Urethral afferent nerve fiber activation augments bladder contraction efficient void urethral anesthesia disrupt sensory feedback impair bladder empty . Specific Aim 1 : To assess void efficiency ( voided volume/ { voided volume + residual volume } ) woman control without urethral anesthesia Hypothesis 1a : Voiding efficiency lower urethra anesthetized micturition pressure-flow study Hypothesis 1b : Detrusor contraction maximum flow rate ( Pdet @ Qmax ) duration detrusor contraction reduce urethra anesthetized micturition pressure-flow study Hypothesis 1c : Voiding anesthetized lead increase valsalva-voiding ( increased intra-abdominal pressure , Pabd ) intermittent urinary stream micturition pressure-flow study Specific Aim 2 : To assess whether urethral anesthesia gel improve discomfort UDS Hypothesis : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score pain low UDS urethra anesthetized Studies support Specific Aims : i. Micturition Urethral Anesthesia Distension fluid flow urethra previously demonstrate evoke sensory nerve discharge . Nerve fire originate urethra able initiate contraction fill bladder increase amplitude duration ongoing bladder contraction . This pudendal-bladder reflex show necessary efficient bladder empty disruption urethral sensory feedback transection sensory branch pudendal nerve intraurethral anesthesia reduces void efficiency rat . Urethral anesthesia human also demonstrate increase post void residual alter symptom experience void phase . This investigator 's approach novel study characterize void healthy woman randomize placebo versus urethral analgesia . Investigators perform UDS , include clinical test bladder function , without urethral anesthesia ( 2 % lidocaine hydrochloride jelly plain aqueous gel ) . ii . Pain Perception During Catheterization Urethral catheterization elicit mild moderate pain woman . The use lubricant anesthetic catheter one available option manage tissue trauma pain perception . Several study report 2 % lidocaine gel reduce procedural pain female urethral catheterization . Others however , find lubricant anesthetic catheter size , effect perception pain urethral catheterization woman . These discrepant report suggest consensus reach efficacy lubricant anesthetic pain perception woman . 4 . Subject Recruitment : Subjects recruit Duke Hospital Duke University Campus via newspaper advertisement paper flier . 5 . Design Procedures To account screen failure , anticipate total 40 female control screen achieve n=20 complete UDS . Subjects perform baseline void test ( uroflow ) , randomize undergoing urodynamic study without urethral analgesia . Participants randomize arm study use random number generator ( MatLab ) . Study staff subject blind treatment regimen ; thus , study design randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial . Inclusion exclusion criterion list separate section . Study Visit Questionnaires Tests After phone screen , ( 3.i ) , participant schedule study visit . All study procedure take place Duke Urogynecology Office Patterson Place . Participants undergo informed consent arrival study visit . Subjects provide urine specimen point care urinalysis pregnancy test . Pre-procedure vital sign , include height weight obtain . Subjects fill follow questionnaire : Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool , Sociodemographics Functional Comorbidity Index complete Medication List . If subject negative urinalysis pregnancy test randomize . If either point care test positive ( per exclusion criterion ) , exclude study refer primary care physician . Prior perform UDS , subject 's bladder scan transabdominally standard clinic bladder scanner . This ensure adequate urine within bladder start first test . The participant place dorsal lithotomy position pelvic exam perform confirm pelvic organ prolapse past hymen valsalva . Uroflow test begin . Subjects undergo 2-hour wait give water re-fill bladder . After two hour , Urodynamic testing perform . Order Studies Performed During Urodynamic Testing : Complex Uroflowmetry , Complex Cystometry , Urethral Pressure Profilometry , Micturition Pressure-flow Study The Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) administer assess discomfort follow time ; uroflow PVR ( baseline ) , immediately urethral catheter place , 100mL fluid instill , full bladder capacity ( MCC ) . After completion UDS procedure , subject complete study visit .</detailed_description>
