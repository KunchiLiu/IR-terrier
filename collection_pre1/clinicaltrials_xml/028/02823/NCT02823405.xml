	<detailed_description>X4P-001 orally bioavailable CXCR4 antagonist demonstrate activity various tumor model . CXCR4 ( C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ) receptor CXCL12 ( C-X-C chemokine ligand type 12 ) . CXCL12 potent chemotactic activity lymphocytes MDSCs ( myeloid-derived suppressor cell ) , important home hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow . CXCR4 also express active multiple type human cancer , include melanoma , ccRCC , ovarian cancer , increase expression CXCR4 tumor cell associate significantly decrease overall patient survival . In animal cancer model , interference CXCR4 function demonstrate disrupt tumor microenvironment ( TME ) unmask tumor immune attack multiple mechanism , include : - Decreasing infiltration MDSCs - Increasing ratio CD8+ T cell Treg cell - Eliminating tumor re-vascularization Pembrolizumab humanize IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody block interaction PD-1 ligand , PD-L1 PD-L2 . Pembrolizumab currently approve treatment unresectable metastatic melanoma . Analysis tumor sample treatment earlier study demonstrate clinical response associate increase density CD8+ T cell tumor parenchyma ( center ) , disease progression associate persistent low level cell . In autochthonous murine model pancreatic adenocarcinoma , persistent tumor growth despite administration anti-PD-L1 similarly associate failure tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell enter TME despite presence peripheral circulation . This immunosuppressed phenotype associate CXCL12 production cancer-associated fibroblast . Moreover , administration CXCR4 antagonist ( AMD3100 ) induce rapid T-cell accumulation among cancer cell , combination anti-PD-L1 , synergistically decreased tumor growth . Based observation , hypothesis effective CXCR4 antagonism X4P-001 would potential benefit patient advance melanoma cancer multiple mechanism , result increase anti-tumor immune attack .</detailed_description>
