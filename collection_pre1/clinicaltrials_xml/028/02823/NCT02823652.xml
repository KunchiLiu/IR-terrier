	<brief_title>Pre-Test Genetic Education Remote Genetic Counseling Communicating Tumor Profiling Results Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy web-based pre-test genetic education ( i.e . receipt tumor profile result ) increase knowledge ( genetic knowledge knowledge test benefit limitation ) . ( Step 1 ) II . To evaluate efficacy web-based pre-test genetic education ( i.e . receipt tumor profile result ) decrease distress ( anxiety , depression cancer specific worry ) compare usual care service patient undergoing tumor profile advanced cancer . ( Step 1 ) III . To evaluate uptake remote genetic counseling ( Step 2 ) IV . To evaluate uptake germline testing among advanced cancer patient potential clinically significant incidental germline mutation identify tumor profile Molecular Analysis Therapy Choice ( MATCH ) trial . ( Step 2 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential moderator suggest self-regulation theory health behavior ( SRTHB ) ( e.g . test result , sociodemographic factor , health literacy , baseline knowledge distress ) change knowledge genetic disease test benefit limitation . ( Step 1 ) II . To evaluate potential moderator suggest SRTHB ( e.g test result , sociodemographic factor , health literacy , baseline knowledge distress ) change distress patient undergoing tumor profile advanced cancer . ( Step 1 ) III . To evaluate factor associated uptake genetic counseling germline test . ( Step 2 ) IV . To evaluate cognitive , affective behavioral ( communication relative ) responses confirmatory germline test advanced cancer patient potential clinically significant incidental germline mutation identify tumor profiling . ( Step 2 ) OUTLINE : STEP I ( PRIMARY INTERVENTION STUDY ) : Participants randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive web-based genetic education consist general information test tumor genetic mutation . ARM B : Patients receive standard genetic education consist conversation treat physician , interaction information clinical staff , information usual resource test genetic mutation . STEP II ( SECONDARY GENETIC COUNSELING SUBSTUDY ) : Patients meet criterion remote counsel substudy receive genetic counsel telephone undergo germline testing . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
