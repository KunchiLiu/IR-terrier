	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well TG4010 nivolumab work treat patient non-small cell lung cancer get bad one line systemic therapy . Vaccines make gene-modified virus , TG4010 , may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving TG4010 nivolumab together may work well treat patient non-small cell lung cancer get bad one line systemic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To evaluate efficacy nivolumab plus TG4010 ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara [ MVA ] -human mucin 1 [ MUC1 ] -interleukin-2 [ IL2 ] vaccine ) patient stage IV non squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) progress one line systemic therapy respect objective response rate ( ORR ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Define safety toxicity profile nivolumab plus TG4010 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 . Determine progression-free survival RECIST 1.1 . Determine overall survival . Determine duration response occurrence response time . Determine rate duration stable disease . Determine disease control rate .</detailed_description>
