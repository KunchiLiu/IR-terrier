	<brief_summary>Despite advance adhesive restorative technique material , dental caries still remain critical concern even today . In addition , recurrent caries relate microleakage common mode failure directly place resin composite restoration . Resin composites particularly susceptible recurrent caries due polymerization contraction also imperfect adhesion restorative tooth tissue . Thus , strong durable bond adhesive restorative tooth tissue increase resistance teeth acid encourage development remineralization essential withstand secondary caries . Fluoride document major contribute factor decline incidence dental caries also accept agent prevention caries . Giomers new group anhydrous resin base direct adhesive restorative material base filler technology ( PRG ) advantage glass ionomers namely , fluoride release recharge , resin composite excellent optical mechanical property .

	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation SI-R21204 Versus Nano-hybrid Resin Composite : A Prospective Controlled Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective control clinical trial evaluate clinical performance restorative material `` SI-R21204 resin composite '' versus `` nano-hybrid resin com-posite '' material Class I Class II cavity need restored per-manent teeth . Giomers new group anhydrous resin base direct adhesive restorative material base filler technology ( PRG ) form stable phase glass ionomer restorative . These material advantage glass ionomers namely , fluoride release recharge , resin composite excellent optical mechanical property . PRG filler fabricate acid-base reaction glass particles polyacrylic acid presence water form wet silicous hydrogel . S-PRG filler particle exhibit three-layer structure glass core envelop stable glass-ionomer hydrogel . This hydrogel surround `` reform phase , '' provide structural protection hydrogel . These material S-PRG technology therefore , differ polyacid modify composite resin glass ionomer hydrogel form water uptake compomer resin matrix polymerization . The chemistry Giomer material facilitate fluoride ion release potential low incidence recurrent caries accept major factor retreat resin restoration . Limited number study available fluoride release , polishability , well clinical survival . The study carry prospective study , assessment restorationsafter three year . The project include 40 patient . Most patient recruit Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics Istanbul . After give consent take part study Class I &amp; II restoration upper low molar premolars performed.The treatment procedure : The patient offer local anesthetic treatment start . The cavity excavate filled accord guideline composite restoration . The control procedure : The restoration evaluate accord marginal adaptation , cavo surface marginal discoloration , approximal contact , fracture , caries associate restoration postoperative hypersensitivity . The control take place two week , one year , two year three year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Primary caries removal Class I &amp; II restorations No obvious untreated caries , dental health problem ( regularly check dentist ) Good moderate oral hygiene ( plaque score less 30 % anterior region treatment ) No untreated periodontal disease ( DPSI 1 , 2 ) Subjects present active carious lesion Subjects age 18 , classify accord American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) ASA I ASA II , present good oral hygiene , free periodontal disease ( probe depth attachment level within normal limit , furcation involvement , mobility ) Subjects agree keep schedule recall appointment data collection maintenance plan stay area least 3 year . Composite amalgam removal Caries extend cementoenamel junction Class II . Considerable horizontal and/or vertical mobility teeth : tooth mobility index score 2 3 Considerable periodontal disease without treatment ( DPSI 3 , 3+ 4 ) Endodontic treatment extensive loss tooth tissue Patients still want bleach teeth bleach teeth less 3 week ago Excluding teeth , oppose natural dentition ( either intact restored intracoronal extracoronal fix restoration ) , minimum 20 teeth Subjects present severe wear facet and/or report parafunctional activity clench nocturnal bruxism Subjects restore removable partial dental prosthesis ( RPDP ) , unless RPDP replace tooth plan restore study Subjects pregnant pregnant duration study Subjects know allergic ingredient resin material</criteria>
