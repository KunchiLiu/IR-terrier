	<brief_summary>To systematically develop , test , refine peripheral vascular electrocardiography-gated fast spin echo magnetic resonance image accurate diagnosis peripheral arterial disease without gadolinium contrast . To test prospectively accuracy fast spin echo peripheral arterial disease patient , compare bolus-chase time-resolved gadolinium enhance magnetic resonance angiography . Additionally , substudy project , compare fast spin echo approach alternative non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image method time-of-flight steady-state gradient echo imaging . The overarch goal research develop validate peripheral magnetic resonance imaging technique accurately depict anatomy disease without expose patient exogenous contrast material associate risk .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients know suspected periphery arterial disease recruit . In initial sequence optimization stage , healthy volunteer also recruit magnetic resonance angiography Patients moderate end stage renal disease ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 ) . These patient recruit unlikely undergo routine contrast enhance magnetic resonance angiography due risk develop Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis . Pregnant patient . Gadolinium chelate FDA Category C drug , therefore avoided pregnancy . Claustrophobic healthy volunteer subject unable lie flat 60 minute . Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60ml/min/1.72m2 coexist history pro inflammatory condition recent surgery , sepsis major infection , arterial venous thrombosis . Any history nephrogenic systemic fibrosis Unable/ unwilling give inform consent Medical contraindication magnetic resonance imaging : e.g . pacemaker , implanted defibrillator , cochlear implant , aneurysm clip , prior/ current metal worker . Patients screen safety questionnaire . Clinically unstable patient Patients newly place stent exclude 8 week post placement</criteria>
