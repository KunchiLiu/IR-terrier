	<brief_summary>Impairments cognition core , severely disable feature schizophrenia lead poor long-term outcome establish treatment available . Particularly impaired executive function ( e.g work memory ) frequently observe consistently associate reduced activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) . Deficits function show closely related negative symptom , think disorder , functional outcome schizophrenia lead notion frontal lobe dysfunction crucially important schizophrenic psychopathology . Noninvasive brain stimulation like tDCS enhance executive function like work memory healthy subject well patient . To identify optimal parameter intervention patient schizophrenia , investigator first test effect different polarity ( anodal , cathodal ) , stimulation intensity ( 1mA , 2mA ) laterality ( leave , right ) working-memory performance ( nback task ) sham-controlled cross-over design ( n=128 ) . To elucidate mechanisms action , oscillatory brain activity register electroencephalography ( EEG ) . These experiment provide reliable data evidence-based development new clinical intervention improve treatment cognitive deficit patient schizophrenia thus enhance schizophrenia prevention recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Mechanisms Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) - Effects Working Memory Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Working hypothesis : In patient subacute schizophrenia , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) exert last beneficial effect working-memory performance . 2 . Research question ( ) : In patient remit early phase schizophrenia , research project aim provide evidence : ) immediate improvement working-memory performance application tDCS dlPFC patient schizophrenia ; ii ) determination optimal stimulation polarity , dosage localization ; iii ) neurophysiological mechanism ( modulation oscillatory activity functional connectivity ) predictor tDCS effect ; iv ) modulate effect gender malleability executive function tDCS . 3 . Previous work investigator : The investigator provide proof-of principle evidence persist improvement cognitive plan polarity-specific learning-stage dependent couple train stimulation . The investigator demonstrate work memory deficient cognitive control enhance anodal tDCS depression effect tDCS modulate genetic polymorphism . The investigator first show impaired cortical plasticity follow tDCS schizophrenia patient different disease state . Finally , investigator successfully finish world-wide large clinical trial investigate efficacy non-invasive brain stimulation ( rTMS ) negative symptom schizophrenia ( DFG 241/10-1 , Falkai , Hasan ) . 4 . Aims work plan : To examine potential tDCS improvement work memory remit schizophrenia investigator follow work plan : I ) Immediate effect performance : Assessment efficacy tDCS polarity ( anodal , cathodal ) , dosage ( 1mA , 2mA ) laterality ( left right dlPFC ) work memory ( adaptive n-back ( 6 ) ) patient ( n=2x2x2x16=128 ) . In two-session cross-over design , stimulation ( tDCS sham ) apply dlPFC ( left right ) 20min ( task performance ) .</detailed_description>
