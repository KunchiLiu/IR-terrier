	<detailed_description>Assessment patient : After inform consent obtain patient affect MONA spectrum disorder investigator assess patient regard follow characteristic : consanguinity , clinical symptom diseases on-set , age on-set symptom age diagnosis , cognitive development , progression clinical symptom related diagnosis , molecular investigation , associate disorder well therapy besides bisphosphonate therapy . Informed consent patient also obtain publish patient 's photograph . All investigation perform accord relevant ethical guideline . Bisphosphonate therapy : The reported patient receive intravenous bisphosphonate therapy either pamidronate ( 1 mg/kg/d two consecutive day every 3 month ) zoledronate ( single dose 0.05 mg/kg/day every 6 month ) .
