	<brief_summary>Unanticipated difficult airway comprises unexpected difficult bag mask ventilation unforeseen difficult laryngoscopy . The incidence difficult laryngoscopy unanticipated difficult intubation child vary 1.2 % 4.77 % depend general specific population type surgery . The known risk factor difficult intubation child young age , associate syndrome congenital abnormality obstructive sleep apnea . Moreover , predictor difficult laryngoscopy physical examination associate short interincisors distance , high frontal plane chin distance , short thyromental distance Cormack &amp; Lehane classification 3 4 . However , little knowledge know regard difficult bag mask ventilation child . The incidence difficult bag mask ventilation 6.6 % accord single study . A study report independent risk factor difficult bag mask ventilation child young age , obesity , use neuromuscular blocking agent airway surgery . In addition , association difficult bag mask ventilation difficult intubation still unknown . To understand difficult bag mask ventilation child factor-association may reduce incidence morbidity mortality identify difficult airway , prepare personnel equipment tool order improve clinical outcome pediatric anesthesia . The objective study determine predictor difficult bag mask ventilation association unexpected difficult intubation child come elective surgery tertiary care hospital southern Thailand .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study protocol anesthesia practice Patient 's demographic history snore asthma/hyper-reactive airway obtain research assistant preinduction period . Standard monitor include non-invasive blood pressure , pulse oximetry , electrocardiography capnography apply patient start general anesthesia . All patient receive general anesthesia oroendotracheal tube intubation . Induction techniques either inhalation anesthetic agent N2O-O2-sevoflurane intravenous agent 100 % O2 . Type anesthetic circuit use ( Circle Jackson-Rees ) depend anesthesiologist charge . Patients head position neutral small head ring prevent head movement induction . Maneuvers bag mask ventilation application CPAP open airway maneuver , oropharyngeal airway two person ventilation record research assistant induction period . When positive pressure ventilation difficult patient sleep , CPAP â‰¥5 cmH2O apply incorporated opening airway head tilt/chin lip jaw thrust assist spontaneous ventilation successful . Then next maneuver bag mask ventilation describe would follow bag mask ventilation still possible . Neuromuscular block agent intubation use depend discretion attend anesthesiologist . If anesthesiologist charge find bag mask ventilation difficult , non-depolarizing muscle relaxant may hold bag mask ventilation successful succinylcholine give assist laryngoscopy procedure . The laryngoscopists nurse anesthetist student , anesthesia resident , nurse anesthetist anesthesiologist staff . Number intubation attempt , Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopic view , intubation time second presence desaturation ( SpO2 &lt; 95 % ) record research assistant intubation period . There many optioned used aid successful intubation apply BURP maneuver , endotracheal tube stylet use , change small endotracheal tube size , change laryngoscope type change experience laryngoscopists . Attending anesthesiologist take responsibility nurse anesthetist student , anesthesia resident nurse anesthetist first second failure intubation attempt . Outcome interest Primary outcomes determine predictor difficult bag mask ventilation . The difficult bag mask ventilation define occurrence least 2 follow event require application CPAP open airway maneuver , require oropharyngeal airway nasopharyngeal airway , require 2- person bag mask ventilation , unable perform bag mask ventilation presence desaturation ( SpO2 &lt; 95 % ) . Secondary outcome find association difficult bag mask ventilation unexpected difficult intubation potential predictor unexpected difficult intubation possible . Unexpected difficult intubation define presence least 2 follow condition laryngoscopic view 3 4 , attempt intubation &gt; 3 time , total intubation time &gt; 300 second presence desaturation ( SpO2 &lt; 95 % ) . The intubation time define time start apply laryngoscope presence positive capnography wave form . In case fail intubation , intubation time start apply laryngoscope remove laryngoscope child 's mouth . The total intubation time combine time intubation attempt</detailed_description>
