	<brief_summary>This confirmatory randomize control trial efficacy novel intervention combine neuroplasticity-based cognitive training aerobic exercise , compare systematic cognitive training alone . Treatment occur 6 month randomization , followup assessment 12 month . The investigator hypothesize combine neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training neurotrophin-enhancing physical exercise produce neurotrophin increase cognitive functional improvement , even relative cognitive training alone . The investigator target period shortly first episode schizophrenia maximize generalization cognitive improvement functional outcome , chronic disability establish .</brief_summary>
