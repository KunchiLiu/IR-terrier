	<detailed_description>Contextualization : Temporomandibular joint dysfunction ( TMD ) define group heterogeneous change affect temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) , affect anatomical functional element , characterize complex multifactorial disease . The common sign joint noise limitation extent mandibular movement , associate articular disc displacement mandibular function predominant symptom pain pre-Auricular , ATM and/or masticatory muscle . A study urban brazilian population show 39.2 % evaluated feature least one sign symptom TMD . Its development relate traumatic acometimentos jaw occlusal interference TMJ , malocclusion , change masticatory muscle , microtrauma cause parafunctional habit , rheumatic disease , emotional stress , anxiety postural abnormality , thus create major impact quality life sleep patient disease . When breakdown anatomical condyle articular eminence , disk , drift occur part , characterize previous joint disc displacement , without reduction . In case , disk present prior mandibular condyle mouth close , resume position , feature disc displacement reduction ( DDCR ) , main feature snap opening . The disc may get introduced condyle entire opening movement , make previous offset oral disc without reduction ( DDSR ) , characterize presence click , include , serious case , cause limitation motion functional change mandible , adaptation retrodiscais tissue . In light whole complexity DTM necessary involvement multidisciplinary team , include physiotherapy , use manual feature , highlight . Manual therapy show important method pain reduction , disable local ischemia , promote breakup fibrous adhesion , improve extensibility contractile structure , increase range motion . Notes use Manual therapy favour transmission afferent information mecanoceptores stimulate proprioception production synovial fluid . Studies apply manual therapy , elect mandibular mobilization technique subject TMD , pain reduction improvement mandibular range . FELÍCIO et al . ( 2008 ) , observed increase WMD pain reduction patient treat Orofacial Miofuncional Therapy association technique massage therapy joint mobilization . Knowledge movement jaw important well understanding normal function temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) study etiology , diagnosis subsequent treatment temporomandibular disorder . The mandibular movement also exert influence joint development masticatory system . Therefore , know three-dimensional movement jaw ( 3D ) relation jaw essential clinical application . A literature provide information range motion measure distance incisal edge teeth like upper low incisor digital central pachymetry average value open mouth UM adult approximately 50 mm . In patient TMD buccal opening average 32 mm 44 mm maximum opening without pain . In way , pick tool exploit well movement evaluation , contribute without therapeutic success . The kinematics increasingly diffuse different area knowledge , gait analysis adolescent , child , biomechanical relate change foot Musculoskeletal change related patellofemoral syndrome , useful also qualitative evaluation ATM graduate movement . So , base previous study research group ( AMARAL et al . 2013 ) ( EL HAGE et al . 2013 ) hypothesis study , basis physiological change promote mandibular nonspecific mobilization change occur without mandibular movement consequent reduction sign symptoms patient temporomandibular joint dysfunction . Justification : Currently , literature investigate various method evaluation possibility treatment TMD . These finding highlight current scientific clinical need health professional , accord multifactorial origin dysfunction , complex diagnostic pathological mechanism may involve several structure Stomatognathic system , show effective therapeutic resource scientifically , good treatment strategy DTM . Thus , study proposes treatment physical therapy manual therapy technique know Mandibular Nonspecific Mobilization , follow analysis jaw movement functional activity , carry pre-and post-intervention physiotherapist . Their result great significance clinical trial understand mandibular movement especially individual present sign and/or symptom TMD need perform type treatment subsequent evaluation mandibular movement . In spite work find literature analysis mandibular movement patient TMD study evaluate compare finding physiotherapeutic treatment , stimulate u pick manual therapy intervention interfere movement , kinematic analysis . As result , reason mention , investigator need continue deepen various study relate treatment evaluation DTM ( FAPESP 2013 processes/23955-6 ; 13/3-18354 ; 12/16093-5 ; 12/07759-0 ; 11/13397-0 ; 11/12537-3 ; 11/04748-4 ; 10/17801-8 ; 08/05980-5 ; 08/05888-1 ) . It know 39.2 % brazilian population , present least sign symptom DTM second epidemiology study . Therefore , show national reference , know TMD multifactorial , therapeutic resource may effective scientifically , good treatment strategy TMD contribute public health help reduction rate incidence , research practice . Research hypothesis : mandibular nonspecific mobilization change mandibular movement increase joint mobility patient TMD pre , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session . Null hypothesis : mandibular nonspecific mobilization change mandibular movement increase joint mobility patient TMD pre , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session . General objective : The objective study evaluate influence mandibular nonspecific mobilization mandibular movement lateralidades , individual diagnosis TMD pre , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session . Specific objective : analyse intensity pain mean numerical scale Pain ( END ) , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session , analyze quality life WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire individual DTM pre , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session , analyze functionality Functional Range Specifies Patient pre , immediately 30 day 12 treatment session . Methodology : It randomise clinical trial , placebo , control blind , design study effect Mandibular Mobilization technique x Nonspecific Placebo ( detuned Ultrasound ) . Individuals allocate two group randomization process block ( two block 24 envelope total ) , use opaque seal envelope contain : Group A = n12 ( intervention ) Group B = n12 ( placebo ) . The evaluation carry use : Research Diagnosis Criteria Temporomandibular joint Disorders ( RDC/TMD ) , END , WHOQOL-BREF , Functional Range Specifies Patient , Central pachymetry Kinematic Analysis . The study divide four phase : Pre-intervention phase : individual shall recruit accordance criterion inclusion assess RDC/TMD diagnosis TMD . The evaluation quality life hold WHOQOL-BREF , intensity pain mesurada END , functionality evaluate Functional range Specifies patient mandibular movement capture analyzed Kinematic motion Analysis . Intervention phase : individual randomise control trial 2 group : Group A ( intervention ) : Mandibular Nonspecific Mobilization Group B ( placebo ) : use ultrasound device detuned . The treatment take place three time week 12 session approximately 30 minute . Before end session , individual evaluate END hold Central pachymetry measure open lateralidades . Post-intervention phase : phase carry reviews pre-intervention phase , occur immediately intervention phase . Follow-up phase : one month last session hold pre pos phase rating . Blinding : Four physiotherapist dentist part Protocol . One responsible evaluation . The second physical therapist responsible intervention phase , blind assessment allocation participant group . Other physical therapist responsible performance kinematic analysis ( dentist monitor collection carry placement removal bracket participant ) quarter process analysis data collect . The randomization concealment allocation carry external developer , non-participant research , organize opaque envelope individual patient intervention ( Group A ) placebo ( Group B ) previously allocate . With process , participant probability one two treatment group . The blinding evaluator patient hold end research data tabulation . SAMPLE CALCULATION : The sample size set pilot study 8 individual DTM , average age 28.6 ± 3.1 year average height 168.2 ± 10.8 cm . The average value oral open movement pre ( 43.31 ± 5.69 mm ) post ( 50.83 ± 4.97 ) 12 session mandibular nonspecific mobilization use estimate . For calculation consider value α = 0.05 ( 5 % chance type I error ) 1-β = 0.95 ( % sample ) . The estimated number 9 individual . Considering possibility sample 20 % loss consider study 11 individual . However , increase statistical power , 15 individual per group use . The calculation carry mean software G * Power . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : The mandibular movement primary outcome three-dimensional kinematics analysis quantify . A pain , functionality quality life secondary outcome .
