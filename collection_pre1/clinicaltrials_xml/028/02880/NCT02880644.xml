	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology Central Retinal Vein Occlusion ( CRVO ) incompletely understood , significant slow-down blood flow , cause various predispose factor , result release VEGF , lead breakdown blood-retinal-barrier finally macular edema . The level VEGF also correlate neovascularization vascular permeability patient ischemic CRVO . Several treatment use treat patient CRVO hemodilution , surgery , laser treatment corticoid injection . However anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) agent administer intravitreal injection , improve visual anatomic outcome patient macular edema secondary CRVO . Aflibercept fusion protein , use intravitreal injection . In patient macular edema secondary CRVO , Aflibercept demonstrate efficacy safety 2 parallel trial , interventional phase III study , COPERNICUS study perform United States GALILEO study perform Europe Asia/Pacific . In study , anatomic outcome ischemic progression retinal perfusion status evaluate secondary objective ; primary objective study visual outcome . With project Hermes Study , first observational study conduct France patient CRVO treat aflibercept , would like evaluate real life monitoring use Aflibercept . The primary objective study also base anatomic outcome . The evolution retinal ischemia degree non-retinal perfusion particularly evaluate use ultra wide field angiography technology .</detailed_description>
