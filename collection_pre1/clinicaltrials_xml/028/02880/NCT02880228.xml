	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone work treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma eligible stem cell transplant . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pembrolizumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone may work well treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Eligible Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine good partial response ( VGPR ) good response rate ( &gt; = VGPR ) 4 cycle pembrolizumab add standard dos lenalidomide dexamethasone , use initial therapy patient previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient , consider eligible stem cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine &gt; = partial response ( PR ) rate 4 cycle treatment pembrolizumab add standard dos lenalidomide dexamethasone . II . To determine &gt; = VGPR response rate time treatment pembrolizumab add standard dos lenalidomide dexamethasone . III . To determine progression free survival overall survival among patient previously untreated symptomatic MM follow treatment combination pembrolizumab , lenalidomide dexamethasone . IV . To determine toxicity associate pembrolizumab add standard dos lenalidomide dexamethasone patient previously untreated symptomatic MM . V. To determine success rate stem cell collection follow initial therapy combination pembrolizumab , lenalidomide dexamethasone patient newly diagnose MM . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. PDL-1 expression myeloma cell non-tumor cell compartment bone marrow assess baseline . II . Measures T-cell activation / exhaustion assess baseline cycle 1 , cycle 2 , cycle 3 , cycle 4 . III . Natural killer ( NK ) cell function number evaluate baseline cycle 1 , cycle 2 , cycle 3 , cycle 4 . OUTLINE : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 dexamethasone PO daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 22 course 1 , day 15 course 2 , day 8 course 3 . Courses 1-3 repeat beyond 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo stem cell transplantation 4 course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
