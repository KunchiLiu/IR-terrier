	<brief_summary>Patients colorectal adenomas suggest receive polypectomy . A substantial number adenoma may miss patient polyp find previous colonoscopy . And water exchange ( WE ) method may increase detection miss adenoma compare traditional air insufflation ( AI ) colonoscopy . The investigator aim investigate whether water exchange colonoscopy method , compare air insufflation method , improve detection miss adenomas patient undergo selective polypectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For WE method , air pump turn full duration insertion avoid inadvertent air insufflation colon elongation . Residual air lumen suction minimize angulation flexure . Water 37°C infuse pump ( Olympus ) biopsy channel confirm correct tip orientation scope advancement . The infused water remove predominantly suction colonoscope smoothly advanced insertion phase , turbid luminal water due residual feces exchange clean water lumen clearly visualize . Occasionally , difficult determine whether colonoscope tip cecum , air allow insufflated observation . If position scope tip confirm cecum , insufflate air would remove suction WE method would continuously use successful intubation . For AI method , water use , air insufflated insertion . Air insufflate distend lumen inspection biopsy polypectomy withdrawal method . Polyps remove forceps biopsy ( polyps size &lt; 3mm ) , cold snare technique ( 3-6mm ) endoscopic mucosal resection ( size≥6mm ) .</detailed_description>
