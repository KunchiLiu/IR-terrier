	<brief_title>Digital Navigation Enhances Cervical Pedicle Screw Placement Accuracy Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current status related study The cervical pedicle tiny structure adjacent important tissue include spinal cord vertebral artery . Cervical pedicle screw internal fixation conventional treatment cervical spine fracture , technique provide acceptable internal fixation ; however , current manipulation method result high pedicle screw penetration rate , high risk damage peripheral vessel nerve , high rate postoperative deformity . Improved technique minimally invasive method transcutaneous pedicle screw implantation design effectively reduce surgery-related injury maintain accuracy safety pedicle screw implantation . Unfortunately , unified standard regard implantation cervical pedicle screw , many pedicle screw implantation method use include partial cervical lamina excision pipeline-dredge discharge . However , technique clinically limited poor maneuverability . Digital navigation emerge technique base discrete-accumulation principle . The technique integrate computer method , numerical control , laser new material , provide new digital technique confirm location orientation cervical pedicle screw , ensure safe surgical operation . Features different related study Previous study focus primarily investigate curative effect pedicle screw implantation cervical spine fracture . To best investigator knowledge , study cervical spine fracture treatment digital navigation-assisted cervical pedicle screw placement June 2006 Web Science . The investigator locate two similar article ( Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy Surgical Trial ( identifier : NCT02076113 ) Slotted Hole Versus Fixed Hole C-Tek ( identifier : NCT00585923 ) ) search ClinicalTrials.gov June 2006 . The outcome measure two study include bony fusion Short Form 36 physical component score . In contrast two study regard inclusion criterion group , investigator study design investigate accuracy safety digital navigation-assisted cervical pedicle screw placement , hop provide valuable quantitative evidence clinical application technique . Adverse event Possible adverse event include expect unexpected symptom . If severe adverse event occur , detail include date occurrence measure take treat adverse event report principal investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access Data collection : Case report form demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , drug allergy history , adverse event collect , process use Epidata software ( Epidata Association , Odense , Denmark ) , collate , record electronically data manager use double-data entry strategy . Data management : The locked electronic database accessible lock project manager , alter . Paper electronic data regard screening , informed consent , clinical outcome preserve Affiliated Hospital Nantong University , China . Data analysis : The electronic database statistically analyze professional statistician create outcome analysis report submit lead researcher . An independent data monitoring committee supervise manage trial data , ensure scientific stringent trial yield accurate complete data . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish http : //www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician use SPSS 19.0 software ( SPSS Inc. ) follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , standard deviation , minimum maximum . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median upper quartile ( q3 ) . The Kruskal-Wallis H-test use compare visual analogue scale spine score among three group , Fisher 's exact test use compare degree bony fusion atlantoaxial joint incidence adverse reaction . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
