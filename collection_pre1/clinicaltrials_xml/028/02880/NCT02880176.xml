	<brief_summary>Radical cystectomy urinary diversion associate substantial perioperative morbidity , include deep venous thrombosis , prolong ileus , postoperative functional decline . Post-operative morbidity cystectomy prolongs length stay , increase risk readmission , add substantially health care cost . Protocols emphasize early frequent ambulation surgery decrease post-operative morbidity , poor patient adherence diminishes effectiveness protocol , currently implement hospital stay . Financial incentives overcome present bias offer novel practical approach increase ambulation post-operative period hospital also discharge . This application propose pilot randomize , control trial estimate effect size financial incentive achieve patient-specific daily step goal hospital post-discharge 1 month follow radical cystectomy . Secondary outcome include step count , composite morbidity , functional decline . Forty-six adult bladder cancer undergo radical cystectomy Hospital University Pennsylvania randomize either control ( education step goal monitor daily feedback ) gain financial incentive combine lottery incentive achieve 75 % daily goal study period . Fitbit Zips use measure step count participant . This proposal provide preliminary data need design future , large trial test effect financial incentive increase ambulation post operative complication , readmission , functional decline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In application , randomize control trial use test hypothesis small financial incentive use increase post-operative ambulation . The randomized controlled trial design necessary demonstrate causal relationship intervention ( provision financial incentive ) outcome ( increased ambulation ) . This design also provide preliminary data ( e.g . effect size , feasibility ) need design large trial determine whether increase ambulation produce financial incentive translate decrease clinically relevant outcome post-operative complication , readmission , functional decline patient undergo major abdominal surgery . All participant receive education importance early ambulation knowledge daily step goal . A Fitbit Zip , commercially available activity track device ability record wirelessly upload step count , provide participant measure outcome daily step count lead period 1-2 week surgery 30 day surgery option patient continue submit data independently 90 day surgery . The lead-in period provide data determine patient-specific daily step count baseline . Step count goal change week determine set-percentage patient-specific baseline . The percentage follow : 10 % baseline week 1 , 25 % baseline week 2 , 40 % baseline week 3 , 55 % baseline week 4 . Data collect use Way To Health platform , digital platform specifically design facilitate randomize control trial test intervention increase health promote behavior . Participants randomize use simple balance randomization one two arm : `` control '' `` financial incentive '' . Individuals inform fail achieve adequate step would otherwise eligible payment order leverage regret aversion . The financial incentive frame `` gain '' rather `` loss '' strive achieve positive reward may provide necessary support positively motivate patient major , painful surgery . Small definite payment combine large lottery-based payment provide ongoing feedback couple possibility win high magnitude reward . Automated notification payment deliver participant 's preferred mode communication ( e.g. , phone call , email ) . Patients track earnings step count time Way Health . Beginning shortly plan surgery continue 30 day date surgery , participant use Fitbit Zips measure daily step count . Patients option submit 90 day post-operative data . Post-operative ambulation repeatedly demonstrate beneficial recovery number different metric , Zip device show accurate measure step count . The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire ( SHAQ ) broadly use validated questionnaire , shorten form , assess subject ability perform 20 different action need assistance action . It also capture patient global assessment pain well-being . This administer preoperatively , 30 day post-operatively , 90 day postoperatively measure post-operative functional decline . The International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) Short Seven Day form quantifies patient report level physical activity seven day prior interview . It similarly broadly use previously validate accelerometer data . This administer preoperatively , 30 day post-operatively , 90 day postoperatively measure post-operative decline physical activity discover difference baseline physical activity capture preoperative step-count data.The Multidimensional Scale Perceived Social Support ( MPPSS ) validate tool assess patient 's self-assessed degree support others . Prior research suggest social support important factor exercise behavior , consistent clinical observation . This administer pre-operatively 30 90 day post-operatively help account confound important otherwise unmeasured variable .</detailed_description>
