	<detailed_description>The present Phase IIa study aim confirm , patient , observed activity MMV390048 P. falciparum pre-clinical model human IBSM human challenge model , determine activity P. vivax malaria patient , 14 28 day . Additional aim characterise safety MMV390048 patient . Patient safety monitor 35 day post-dose include pharmacokinetic assessment . The study investigate descend single dos MMV390048 response result obtain first cohort/dose malaria sub type . The result trial identify active , well tolerate dos investigation combination partner drug within Phase IIb clinical trial . Preclinical study use SCID mouse inoculate P. falciparum-infected red blood cell link dose exposure efficacy MMV390048.38 The active dose SCID model cause maximum effect ( ED90 ) parasites 1 mg/kg/day . The MPC derive SCID data 39 ng/ml.39 A human dose treatment P. falciparum sought could maintain blood concentration 39 ng/ml ( 100 nM ) 8 day . Assuming linear pharmacokinetics base observe data Phase I exploratory formulation study human volunteer , dose approximately 20 mg would estimate achieve pharmacodynamic target drug concentration human base preclinical efficacy data generate SCID mouse model . For new antimalarial drug translation predict efficacious dose SCID mouse human challenge model turn treatment acute , uncomplicated P. vivax P. falciparum unknown . To minimise risk patient ensure high probability success , maximum safe dose ( determine healthy volunteer ) maintain toxicokinetic safety margin repeat dose study select first cohort study . This dose expect exceed predict MPC Day 8 provide significant target coverage site action .</detailed_description>
