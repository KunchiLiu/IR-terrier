	<brief_summary>Besides classical cardiovascular risk factor smoke , obesity , elevate cholesterol level diabetes also acute factor potentially trigger acute coronary event . The impact various substance air pollution describe . Particulate matter , especially small particle size ( &lt; 2.5Âµm ) show positive correlation myocardial infarction . However , study fail show correlation . With respect nitric oxydes majority publish study detect significant correlation myocardial infarction , , although highly rank publication fail show result . In addition data impact sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide concentration cardiac event heterogeneous . Published data indicates additive effect age epidemiological variable suggest need multivariate analysis . The rationale study test mention air pollution factor significant independent impact incidence myocardial infarction</brief_summary>
