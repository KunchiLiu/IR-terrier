	<brief_summary>Obesity represent one important public health issue accord World Health Organization reach epidemic proportion globally . The prevalence childhood obesity rapidly increase past decade associate multiple co-morbid disease state . It estimate approximately 15.5 % child adolescents obese body mass index ≥95th percentile age . This pose health concern patient , also place increase demand healthcare system already overwhelmed burgeon cost . Moreover , obese child adolescent maintain excessive weight adult predispose cardiovascular disease premature death . In carefully select patient fail lose weight diet exercise , bariatric surgery provide option obtain healthy weight . It increasingly become attractive option , number adolescent undergo bariatric surgery United States triple 2000 2003 . Obese patient often afflict multi-organ dysfunction obstructive sleep apnea , present unique challenge anesthesiologist manage perioperative care . Bariatric surgery obese adolescent may associate significant postoperative pain . Potent intravenous opioids fentanyl morphine mainstay perioperative pain management . Unfortunately , respiratory depression airway obstruction often occur follow administration opioids obese patient . This make provide safe analgesic regimen difficult perioperative setting . As opioids associate respiratory depression upper airway obstruction , surgeon anesthesiologist alike must reconcile adequacy pain control risk respiratory complication surgery obese adolescent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Treat Bariatric Surgery-associated Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine non-opioid drug show utility bariatric surgery adult population analgesic property . It lipophilic imidazole derivative selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist sedative analgesic property devoid respiratory depressant effect . Dexmedetomidine produce sedation modulate release neurotransmitter norepinephrine within locus coeruleus brain , vital produce awake state . In addition , directly stimulate α2-receptors spinal cord , dexmedetomidine inhibits fire nociceptive neuron responsible propagation pain signal . Although dexmedetomidine agent many off-label clinical application pediatric setting , much pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics property remain unknown . This even evident pediatric patient obese . Currently , report pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study investigate dexmedetomidine obese child adolescent . Our previous experience use dexmedetomidine perioperative period along robust obese surgical population certainly support notion well poise conduct propose trial</detailed_description>
