	<criteria>Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Be 18 year age old day signing inform consent . Histologically confirm diagnosis pure mixed urothelial cancer . Stage IV cancer AJCC stag criterion . Patients stage IV result cT4b disease eligible . Progression disease ( radiographic clinical ) antiPD1 antiPDL1 therapy least 9 week date start antiPD1 antiPDL1 therapy . Presence index lesion great equal 1 cm amenable hypofractionated radiotherapy Patients metastatic cancer must least one lesion outside radiation field measure great one cm follow RECIST 1.1 . This lesion , close radiated lesion , must receive 10 % dose prescribed target lesion . Have provide tissue archival tissue sample newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Ability tolerate hypofractionated radiation therapy ( e.g . lie flat hold position ) Demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab perform within 14 day treatment initiation . Patients dialysis exclude study . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses 1 year . 14 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Exclusion Criteria Is currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Systemic steroid administer specifically premedication chemotherapy infusion radiotherapy allow . Has prior monoclonal antibody within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , less Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , less Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects less Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . A history prior radiotherapy precludes delivery hypofractionated radiotherapy Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 3 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Subjects vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Subjects require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Subjects hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement Sjogrens syndrome exclude study . Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose trial treatment . Had progression disease within 9 week start prior antiPD1 antiPDL1 monotherapy therapy . Has prior cisplatinumbased chemotherapy , unless subject consider cisplatinumineligible base meeting least one follow criterion : a. ECOG performance status 2 ( proportion ECOG 2 subject limit approximately 50 % total population ) b. Creatinine clearance ( calculate measure ) less 60 mL/min great 30 mL/min Note : Subjects creatinine clearance ( calculate measure ) less 30 mL/min dialysis exclude trial . c. CTCAE v.4 , Greater Grade 2 audiometric hearing loss ( 25dB two consecutive wave range ) d. CTCAE v.4 , Greater Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy e. NYHA Class III heart failure</criteria>
