	<brief_summary>The primary scientific objective study entail examine whether alter endogenous pain inhibition present child functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) compare healthy control ( Part 1 ) . A secondary objective implies examine whether pediatric pain neuroscience education ( PNE ) able improve pain catastrophizing , pain-related fear , pain intensity ( include symptom index central sensitization ) pain-related functional disability child FAP IBS ( Part 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder ( AP-FGIDs ) common child , show prevalence 13.5 % Western population develop country . Gastrointestinal disorder categorise within Rome criterion III , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) ( 65 % ) functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) ( 35 % ) commonly occur subtypes , follow FAP syndrome , functional dyspepsia abdominal migraine . These number call action , know persistent pain period associate AP-FGIDs significantly interfere child 's daily functioning . Children suffer AP-FGIDs participate less recreational activity , show difficulty maintain social contact , absent school express academic impairment . Additionally , report decrease health relate quality life need health care utilization . To date , pathogenesis underlie AP-FGIDs child remain unclear . Previous study suggest abnormal brain-gut interaction , alter gut motility , visceral hypersensitivity , psychosocial disturbance immune activation possible explanation symptom . In accordance research adult FGIDs evidence even grow contribution central sensitization ( CS ) development persistence AP-FGIDs child . CS define `` amplification neural signalling within central nervous system elicit pain hypersensitivity '' `` increase responsiveness nociceptive neuron central nervous system normal subthreshold afferent input '' . This process encompass malfunction descend inhibitory nociceptive pathway result dysfunctional endogenous analgesic control increase activity descend nociceptive facilitation overactivity pain neuromatrix brain . A systematic review address contribution CS pediatric chronic pain condition conclude manifestation somatic hyperalgesia alter central pain processing child recurrent abdominal pain disorder ( RAP ) deficient descend inhibitory nociceptive processing girl irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) indicative CS subtypes AP-FGIDs ( review progress ) . However , give heterogeneous study population , different protocol method use objectify presence CS review , clear statement could make . In addition , study examine descend inhibitory nociceptive processing child FAP find . Descending inhibitory nociceptive processing might dysfunctional child FAP IBS . Anyhow , research demonstrate manifestation CS influence child 's characteristic . Behavioural response , emotional cognitive aspect involve facilitation sensitization increase cerebral activation limbic structure , insula large area frontal , temporal parietal cortex , result diminish inhibition descend pathway . Parental behaviour may also play important role child 's adjustment pain . Parents consider essential participant management child 's pain , parental attitude , response , belief influence child 's pain adherence treatment . Indeed , parental solicitous behaviour ( e.g. , accord special privilege child ) parental discouraging behaviour ( e.g. , criticize child ) find associate increased functional disability . Further , evidence suggest child 's pain belief pain cop skill may model parent ' ( maladaptive ) pain belief pain cop skill . Additionally , increased level parent emotional distress link high level child functional disability self-reported pain . This underscore importance include parent assessment treatment pediatric chronic pain optimal outcome . Negative cognition parent child develop understand origin FAP IBS . Based premise well understanding nature illness result improve patient outcome , child parent addressed education . Given possible contribution CS child FAP IBS , education include explanation reassurance cause pain , brief summary relevant pain mechanisms integral role psychosocial physical factor precipitate maintain pain . This main content give pain neuroscience education ( PNE ) . PNE study various adult chronic pain population show effective change pain belief improve health status well pain cop strategy . In contrast traditional model tissue injury nociception pain , PNE aim describe nervous system interpret information tissue peripheral nerve sensitization , central sensitization , synaptic activity brain processing . It also explain neural activation , either upregulation downregulation , ability modulate pain experience response ( absence ) nociceptive input . Patients thus educate nervous system 's processing injury , conjunction various psychosocial aspect , determines pain experience pain always true representation status tissue . Up recently , study examine benefit PNE context pediatric chronic pain . Drawing upon available evidence adult sample , expect PNE provide child lead beneficial child pain-related outcome . Involving parent PNE session facilitate increase parental understanding biopsychosocial factor influence child 's pain , well learn support child manage symptom . Concrete , present study examine ( 1 ) function descend inhibitory nociceptive processing child FAP IBS compare healthy child ( Part 1 ) whether ( 2 ) reconceptualization pain , PNE , able influence pain catastrophizing , pain-related fear , pain intensity ( include symptom index central sensitization ) pain-related functional disability ( Part 2 ) .</detailed_description>
