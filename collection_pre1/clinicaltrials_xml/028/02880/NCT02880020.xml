	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Is Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate nivolumab alone combination ipilimumab subject metastatic locally advanced/unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Ascertain response rate nivolumab alone combination ipilimumab subject metastatic locally advanced/unresectable GIST Choi criterion . II . Assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . Ascertain clinical benefit rate ( CBR = complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] stable disease [ SD ] ) nivolumab ipilimumab refractory/unresectable GIST . IV . Explore safety nivolumab monotherapy nivolumab ipilimumab population assess frequency severity adverse event ( AEs ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare RR CBR patient whose tumor program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive ( + ) PD-L1 negative ( - ) baseline . II . In patient PD-L1 positive , compare RR CBR patient 1 % 5 % tumor membrane stain . III . Determine baseline mutational load patient start treatment . IV . Determine response treatment base baseline mutation load baseline GIST mutation . V. Determine response rate base GIST mutational status . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 ipilimumab IV 30 minute every 6 week . Courses repeat every 14 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
