	<brief_summary>The first purpose study determine dopamine synthesis capacity significantly low treatment non-responders illness onset relative treatment responder .

	<brief_title>18 Fluorine ( F ) DOPA Determinants Predictors Treatment Response Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia amongst lead cause global disability adult . A major factor underlie 30 % patient show little response first-line antipsychotic drug . There one drug , clozapine , proven efficacy patient . However , currently good predictor treatment non-response consequently patient undergo empirical trial first-line drug . This contribute long delay , average 4-5 year , see identify start patient clozapine . Furthermore , clozapine poorly tolerate potentially life-threatening side-effects , mean investigator desperately need new , alternative drug . Lack understanding neurobiological basis underlie non-response impeded development alternative clozapine past . However recently show non-responders show reduce dopamine synthesis capacity relative patient respond antipsychotic . The effect size difference large , &gt; 1.2 . This study cross-sectional , patient already receive antipsychotic treatment number year . The key question thus : 1. dopamine synthesis capacity different illness onset drug na誰ve patient subsequently show non-response antipsychotic treatment relative drug na誰ve patient respond treatment 2. possible predict respond treatment To test investigator go investigate relationship presynaptic dopamine dysfunction antipsychotic responsiveness prospective study . For , investigator go measure striatal dopamine synthesis capacity use [ 18 fluorine ( F ) ] DOPA positron emission tomography drug-na誰ve first episode psychosis determine treatment response 6 week treatment amisulpride . Response define &gt; 30 % reduction symptom rating Positive Negative Syndrome Scale . The effect size cross-sectional study d=1.3 . Based effect size sample size 12 per group &gt; 80 % power detect group difference p &lt; 0.05 2-tailed use independent t-test . Given non-response rate 30 % investigator thus require 40 patient baseline get 12 non-responders . To allow 20 % drop-outs require 50 patient baseline .</detailed_description>
