	<brief_title>Effect Fresh Amniotic Membrane Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , control open-label study design evaluate safety effectiveness Affinity fresh amniotic membrane plus standard care therapy ( SOC ) versus SOC treatment diabetic foot ulcer . The standard care therapy study offload DFU , appropriate sharp surgical debridement , aggressive infection management . A number offload system commercially available . The choice offload discretion Principal Investigator total contact casting , fix ankle walker boot , equivalent device fix ankle walker boot . The study two phase : Screening Treatment . The Screening Phase ( 1 -14 day ) design determine whether subject eligible proceed Treatment Phase study consist series screen assessment design determine eligibility . At first Screening Phase Visit , Investigator select study ( target ) ulcer . Each subject one DFU select study ( target ) ulcer . In situation subject one DFU S1 visit , Investigator select large DFU meet eligibility criterion protocol study ( target ) ulcer . Subjects whose target ulcer treat SOC 2 week eligible enter treatment phase immediately inclusion exclusion criterion meet . If ulcer receive SOC , subject place SOC enrol study 14 day offload . The Treatment Phase ( 12 week ) begin series assessment design confirm subject ' continue eligibility . Investigators debride ulcer , require . Subjects whose ulcer continue meet eligibility criterion randomize 1 2 group : ( 1 ) standard care plus weekly application fHSAM 4 week thereafter per treatment guideline ( 2 ) standard care . During Treatment Phase , subject evaluated weekly basis . Efficacy evaluation week include Investigator assessment ulcer heal measurement ulcer size use digital photo . Safety evaluation Treatment Phase consist adverse event assessment visit . Subject see weekly ( ± 3 day ) ulcer heal study exit study ulcer area reduce least 40 % within 6 week , 1 week last application treatment week 12 .</detailed_description>
