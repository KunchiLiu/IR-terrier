	<detailed_description>History current status related study Intertrochanteric femoral fracture frequently occur elderly often complicate different level osteoporosis , mostly belong unstable fracture . This disorder also frequently complicate various chronic disease , make patient poorer surgical tolerance . Surgical treatment widely accept treatment method intertrochanteric femoral fracture accelerate recovery reduce complication cause long-term bed time . Intertrochanteric femoral fracture unstable occur mostly elderly , surgical treatment meet requirement include less risk wound infection , less intraoperative blood loss , great hold potential strong stability implant , contribute early hip joint function exercise facilitate recovery surgery . According design principle orthopedic implant , intramedullary extramedullary fixation commonly use . Compared extramedullary fixation , intramedullary fixation place fixators closer affected region , produce short moment arm force , good share compression force medial cortex femoral neck , exhibit high shear resistance , provide great stabilization complex fracture elderly . Compared Garmma nail , AO ( Association Osteosynthesis ) proximal femoral nail antirotation screw proximal end ensure elastic fixation fracture reduce complication femoral shaft fracture . Nevertheless , 2 screw instal femoral neck , restrict slippage main screw compression screw , thus partial loading deliver antirotation screw , lead occurrence complication antirotation screw cut compression screw withdrawal . Conventional internal fixation method include implantation dynamic hip screw , Gamma nail , proximal femoral intramedullary nail exhibit unfavorable effect treatment intertrochanteric femoral fracture , particular complicate severe osteoporosis method achieve firm reliable fixation occasional nail head cut nail withdrawal . Therefore , AO/ASIF ( Association Osteosynthesis/Association Study Internal Fixation ) design novel antirotation intramedullary nail , good reduces abovementioned complication . Proximal femoral nail antirotation ( PFNA ) device design base proximal femoral intramedullary nail intramedullary nail . This device equip spiral wide blade exhibit obvious antirotation angular shear stress ability , greatly reduce complication decrease possibility surgical delay . Compared conventional screw system , PFNA provide strong antirotation anti-inversion ability . For tap spiral blade femoral neck , lateral femoral cortex open without need remove bone matrix . The spiral blade tap femoral neck produce compression bone femoral neck . Even though patient severe osteoporosis , spiral blade femoral neck produce firm anchor force femoral neck . Compared screw fixation , spiral blade exhibit large rotational torque , require small strength pull , need additional screw tap femoral neck , latter easy operate . The PFNA medial-lateral angle 6° , allow insertion tip great trochanter . The distal diameter PFNA relatively small , eccentricity reduce compare intramedullary nail , suitable anatomical morphology proximal femoral medullary cavity . The locking pore PFNA distal tip include round static oval-shaped dynamic type . Vertical installation screw consider dynamic interlocking oblique installation screw static interlocking . From perspective design , PFNA exhibit well biomechanical stability show advantage duration surgery , intraoperative blood loss , failure rate surgery overall complication internal fixation method . PFNA treatment intertrochanteric femoral fracture many case report , related study mainly retrospective case series , retrospective randomize control trial report . Features different related study Progress : PFNA device design base modification Garmma nail integrates advantage dynamic hip screw ( DHS ) use extramedullary fixation intramedullary fixation device . PFNA exhibit advantage DHS , include ( 1 ) small stress shielding , conducive fracture healing , reduce cut-out phenomenon ; ( 2 ) good share compressive stress medial femur , lead low incidence hip deformity . Both proximal femoral intramedullary nail PFNA belong intramedullary nail , latter exhibit follow advantage : ( 1 ) one assembly achieve antirotation angular stability ; ( 2 ) wide blade tip compress much peripheral matrix possible , particular circumstance osteoporosis , exhibit well hold potential ; ( 3 ) blade PFNA closely attach matrix , strengthen stabilization implant prevents rotation varus deformity ; ( 4 ) biomechanical test confirm spiral blade greatly increase shear capacity ; ( 5 ) spiral blade implant via lateral incision internal fixation feature include minimal wound , less bleeding , satisfied reduction , rapid recovery , highly stable fractured stump , conducive early exercise , avoidance prolong force arm cause extramedullary fixation , increase shear stress proximal femur , greatly reduce possibility failure internal fixation . Feasibility : Intramedullary nail treatment long bone fracture widely use clinic expert consensus achieve . The novel PFNA treatment interchochanteric femoral fracture elderly produce minimal wound , easily perform , therefore highly feasible clinic . Our team ready perform project various perspective : ( 1 ) Personnel : This project equip 2 chief physician , 2 associate chief physician , 3 attend physician , 2 resident physician , 1 graduate student . Our team strong clinical scientific research capacity . ( 2 ) Techniques : team perform open close reduction intramedullary nail fixation many patient , experience , provide sophisticated surgical skill orthopedic trauma joint surgery . ( 3 ) Equipment : The study set equip orthopedic traction bed , X-ray , CT , MR scanner large equipment . All provide hardware software support . Safety : Under fluoroscopic guidance , close reduction follow minimally invasive intramedullary nail fixation , effectively avoid vessel nerve injury . Data collection , management , analysis open access Data collection : According trial design type requirement , table develop record trial data . The recorded data input electronic database use double-data entry strategy train professional staff . Data management : Information accuracy check recruited patient follow . The database lock research charge alter . All information relate trial preserve Chaohu Hospital Anhui Medical University , China . Data analysis : The electronic database fully disclose professional statistician statistical analysis . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS19.0 software . The normally distribute continuous variable express mean ± standard deviation , non-normally distributed variable express median quartile . The categorical variable express count percentage . Paired test Wilcoxon test ( paired sample ) use comparison continuous variable prior PFNA implantation chi-square test comparison categorical variable prior PFNA implantation . A level P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
