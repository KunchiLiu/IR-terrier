	<brief_summary>Although negatively bias attention central theoretical empirical role maintenance depression , behavioral treatment successfully target improve deficit . The current proposal build upon prior work aim develop attention bias modification intervention . The investigator propose develop highly specific intervention directly target negative attention bias neurobiology support , use cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience inform treatment development improve quality life patient whose psychopathology maintain negative attention bias .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Attention Bias Modification Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal project continue development attention bias modification ( ABM ) intervention target reduce negative attention bias among adult elevate symptoms depression . The investigator ' prior work indicate attention bias negative information associate maintenance depression neural circuitry within frontal-parietal brain network support bias attention negative information , thus allow u develop specific target intervention directly alter neurobiology negative attention bias . The propose R33 study build upon investigator ' prior National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) fund work ( R21MH092430 ) , examine whether ABM reduces negative attention bias improve symptom depression . Findings indicate compare placebo ABM , active ABM reduce negative attention bias increase rest state connectivity within neural circuit ( i.e. , middle frontal gyrus dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ) support control emotional information . Further , change negative attention bias pre- post-ABM significantly correlate depression symptom change active training condition . Importantly , 40 % decrease symptom observe active training condition ; however , similar symptom reduction also observe `` placebo ABM '' condition . Exploratory analysis indicate placebo training may promote depression improvement enhance sustain attention . Although preliminary finding encourage demonstrate ABM successfully alter treatment target ( i.e. , negative attention bias ) , investigator ' prior work among first document efficacy ABM among adult clinically significant depression . It prudent necessary obtain additional efficacy evidence ABM move forward large-scale clinical trial ABM depression . Aim 1 conduct randomize clinical trial among adult elevate symptom depression negative attention bias compare efficacy active ABM cognitive control train assessment-only control condition involve ABM procedure . Aim 2 examine whether ABM alters negative attention bias functional connectivity within frontal-parietal neural circuitry support negative attention bias . Aim 3 identify mechanism responsible putative efficacy active ABM cognitive control training . Study Impact : The current project propose target reduce negative attention bias novel intervention ground basic psychopathology research . The investigator believe experimental medicine approach lead development highly specific target intervention , use cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience inform treatment development , improve quality life people whose psychopathology maintain negative attention bias .</detailed_description>
