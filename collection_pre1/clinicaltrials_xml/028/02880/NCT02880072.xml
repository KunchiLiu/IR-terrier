	<brief_summary>A phosphate supplement part treatment patient refeeding syndrome ( RFS ) . It known , generalized edema also affect intestine decrease absorption . The aim investigate , oral treatment possible mild moderate RFS . In randomized crossover design 12 hospitalized head-neck cancer patient ingest four oral solution phosphate two-day period . In low-dose period investigator compare five mmol phosphate either skim milk Di-sodiumphosphate-di-hydrate potassium di-hydrogens-phosphate black currant flavor ( PBC ) , high-dose period 20 mmol either Addiphos® PBC-solution . P-phosphate measure two four hour ingestion , urinary excretion four hour . P-phosphate significantly increase PBC low- high-dose Addiphos® , skim milk . The increase large Addiphos® PBC-solution . There difference increase patient low p-phosphate normal value , correlation baseline p-phosphate percent increase . There group difference urinary excretion phosphate . The investigator conclude phosphate readily absorb oral administration , skim milk can´t recommend purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design non-blinded , randomize , control crossover intervention study . A total 12 hospitalize adult head-neck cancer patient , 11 men one woman , give inform consent participate . Six patient p-phosphate 0.30-0.80 mmol/l include well six patient ( control ) p-phosphate normal range 0.80-1.50 mmol/l . The control patient match hypophosphatemic patient regard sex , age ( ± 10 year ) alcohol habit . Patients diagnose renal failure , edema , diabetes , liver failure , gastrointestinal disorder , pregnant lactate woman exclude . None patient phosphate supplementation within previous 24 h. Randomization determine order phosphate supplement divide low-doses five mmol follow high-dose 20 mmol two day period . Accordingly , four day intervention different phosphate supplement every day . In low-dose period supplement consist daily dose five mmol phosphate skim milk ( 97 mg phosphorus 0.1 g fat/100 ml ) Phosphate black currant flavor ( PBC ) ( disodiumphosphatedihydrate potassiumdihydrogenphosphate , 1 mmol phosphate/ml ) . In high-dose period supplement consist 20 mmol phosphate Addiphos® ( Fresenius-Kabi ) ( disodiumphosphate , potassiumdihydrogenphosphate , potassiumhydroxide , 2 mmol/ml ) PBC . The patient fast six hour prior baseline blood- urine sample four hour trial . Blood sample repeat two four hour , urine four hour . The interval blood sample determine basis animal experiment , describe phosphate absorption measure plasma 1 hour administration ( 10 ) . The interval extend 2 hour due risk gastric retention . The primary outcome change p-phosphate . The secondary outcome change u-phosphate change p-potassium , p-magnesium p-sodium . The paired data test Wilcoxon test . Non pair data test Mann-Whitney test . Spearman-rank correlation test use , statistical analysis perform STATA version 13.1 ( StataCorp LP , USA , Texas ) .</detailed_description>
