	<brief_summary>The microthreaded platform switch implant could control stress suitable range . The splint would disturb function . So necessary know whether splint single-unit crown fit adjacent multi-implants . Outcome variable : Splinted single-unit crown one side implant non-splinted single-unit crown side Materials method : 80-100 consecutive implant least 20 patient would include implant- supported restoration posterior maxilla mandibular . All patient would general good health . For every patient , posterior teeth lose side 6 month . All patient treat qualified surgeon . Prosthetics procedure would perform experienced prosthodontist . The two side allocated test control group accord predefined computer-generated randomization table . Clinical evaluation radiographic analysis perform oral maxillofacial radiologist aware type Prosthetics technique use .</brief_summary>
