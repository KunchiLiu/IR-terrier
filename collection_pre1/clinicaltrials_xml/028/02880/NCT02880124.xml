	<detailed_description>The study require 4 meeting subject : 30-minute meeting explain project ; meet 2 hour ( glucose tolerance test , rest ) ; one-hour meeting ( maximum oxygen consumption test ( VO2max ) exercise conduct electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer , meet 4 hour experimentation ( 120-min exercise stationary bicycle ingestion solution carbohydrate sweeten water , 20-km time trial ) . Visit # 1 - Pre-participation ( screen visit ) Following initial contact phone email , subject invite individual meeting last 15 minute . During meeting , one project manager check eligibility potential subject study , eligible , present detail protocol specify discomfort risk involve . The participant require fill Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) give copy consent form . We request name contact detail person contact case emergency , information record preserve subject matter . A period least three day allocate make decision whether participate study . If participant decides participate study , invite second visit ( oral glucose tolerance test ) occasion sign consent form . Visit # 2 - Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) This test perform Exercise Physiology Laboratory Department kinesiology University Montreal procedure commonly use test . This procedure require ingestion 300 mL water contain 75 g glucose morning ( around 8am ) 12 hour fast , blood sample tip finger 0 , 60 120 minute measurement blood glucose . Subjects high blood glucose 5 mmol/L ingestion glucose great 8 mmol/L ingestion ( 60 120 min ) consider study . These glucose tolerance standard stringent World Health Organization , objective test diagnosis glucose tolerance prognosis future development , n include study subject good glucose tolerance . Visit # 3 - Maximum oxygen uptake testing : cycling VO2max This test conduct Exercise Physiology Laboratory Department kinesiology University Montreal . Exercise involve pedal stationary bike power output ( resistance ) gradually increase reach VO2max . During execution test , subject wear surface electrode measure heart rate , mouthpiece nose clip measure volume expire gas well oxygen carbon dioxide content determine consumption oxygen carbon dioxide production . This type test routinely use laboratory . The test stop time subject . For test , guideline establish Exercise Physiology Laboratory Department kinesiology University Montreal follow . These guideline base recommendation ethic safety `` American College Sports Medicine '' . 4- Experimentation The test conduct Exercise Physiology Laboratory Department kinesiology University Montreal . The exercise carry stationary cycle ergometer . It last 120 minute power output correspond 60 % VO2max obtain maximal test . A volume carbohydrate solution ( 120 g , 6 % carbohydrate volume ) sweeten water administer subject ( 571 mL ) exercise ( 286 mL every 30 minute ) . The following solution administer balance , randomize , double-blind model : maple sap , maple syrup , corn syrup , glucose , GatoradeÂ© , glucose trace ( 0.001 % carbohydrate volume ) water . Under condition trace water glucose administer , natural sweetener ( stevia ) add obtain sweet taste similar condition . Besides condition water ingested carbohydrate solution artificially enrich 13C . The volume ingest 30 minute exercise artificially enrich deuterium ( D2O , 8g incorporate ingestion 286 mL ) .</detailed_description>
