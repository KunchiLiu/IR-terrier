	<brief_summary>A key function brain identify temporal structure environment use form expectation . These expectation allow u plan organize behavior towards change environment , optimize use attentional motor resource . They also allow u establish harmonious social interaction , coordinate u interlocutor exchange . Our ability form temporal expectation seem emerge early development process unknown . We know set basic skill , probably related ability , present birth . This suggest temporal processing capability emerge prenatal period , study . The objective project study preterm infant brain 's ability process interval stimuli form expectation basis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perception Temporal Regularity Tactile Stimulation : Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy Study Preterm Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patient ( 20 per group ) : Presence functional response stimulus omission , test group ( regular presentation ) . Group 1 receive test stimulation sequence ( regular ) , Group 2 receive control stimulation sequence ( random ) . During test sequence , vibration repeat 3 interspersed interval 5 , create expectation presentation next stimulus . Every 8 12 vibration ( random ) , vibration omit . According hypothesis , observe activity somatosensory cortex omission . A total 10 omission present , bring total duration stimulus presentation 13 minute . During control sequence , interstimulus interval irregular , 3 7 second , induce expectation . Omissions case associate functional brain response . The presence activation primary somatosensory cortex assess use Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy ( DCS ) , newborns 32 , 33 35 week correct gestational age , omission regular vibrotactile stimulation sequence ( test group ) respect irregular sequence ( control group ) . A difference activation omission group reflect presence processing time interval cortical level . We also assess difference amplitude time peak response correct gestational age vigilance state . Main endpoint : amplitude neurovascular response significantly high / time peak significantly short omission test group ( regular sequence ) compare control group ( irregular sequence ) , evaluate twice : age correct SA 33 ± 3 day 35 week ± 3 day , possible SA 32 ± 3 day ( optional measure depend gestational age birth time obtain consent ) . Secondary endpoint : significant difference amplitude / time peak neurovasculat response correct gestational age vigilance state .</detailed_description>
