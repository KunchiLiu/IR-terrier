	<brief_summary>Is real-time myocardial perfusion echocardiography ( RTMPE ) feasible effective non-invasive method detect significant Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy pediatric adult cardiac transplant recipient ? Will perfusion deficit correlate significant coronary artery stenosis identify standard stress echocardiography Invasive Coronary Angiography ( ICA ) , identify diffuse small vessel disease effectively current non-invasive technique ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real Time Myocardial Perfusion Echocardiography Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart transplant recipient susceptible develop unique disease cause blockages artery transplant heart ( coronary artery ) call Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy ( CAV ) . Because CAV often progress without symptom , transplant recipient undergo regular surveillance test CAV detect treatment offer significant damage transplant heart occur . Current test use detect CAV either invasive ( risk complication ) may able detect CAV early stage . Myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography safe non-invasive diagnostic test may well suit detect CAV , however well studied heart transplant recipient . This study examine ability myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography detect CAV adult pediatric heart transplant recipient , compare result current standard testing strategy Invasive Coronary Angiography ( ICA ) standard stress echocardiography . This help determine whether myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography well test regular surveillance CAV adult pediatric transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
