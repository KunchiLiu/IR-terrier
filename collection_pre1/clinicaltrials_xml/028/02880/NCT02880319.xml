	<brief_title>Phase II Protocol Evaluating Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Oligometastatic Disease Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat metastasis bone . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . SBRT advance technique allows precise delivery radiation standard radiation therapy . In comparison standard radiation therapy , allow u give high dos radiation tumor limit radiation dose go surround normal tissue . This technology make possible advance image treatment capability radiation treatment machine . SBRT work standard radiation therapy work damage cancer cell . SBRT use deliver radiation people cancer lung metastases spine liver . Studies group show low rate side effect good rate kill cancer area prevent come back . In current research study , investigator look evaluate well type radiation control disease bone whether toxicity ( side effect ) SBRT differs standard treatment . The investigator hypothesis toxicity might less , less normal tissue receive radiation SBRT standard treatment . It important note SBRT , like standard radiation therapy participant disease , use attempt stop growth cancer cell bone metastasis relieve prevent symptom ( ex . pain ) associate bone metastasis . The goal SBRT cure participant cancer . The primary goal study see well SBRT control disease bone , investigator also want analyze ability control disease symptom without added toxicity .</detailed_description>
