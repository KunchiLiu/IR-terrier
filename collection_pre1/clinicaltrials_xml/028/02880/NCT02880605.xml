The investigator recruit 4000 patient undergo elective coronary angiography positive outcome consecutively collect baseline information . Sequently , one-year follow do collect prognose , include death , rehospitalization , medicine , medical compliance life quality etc . One hand , investigator compare outcomes different therapy indication accord C-AUC evaluate validation C-AUC . On hand , investigator evaluate rationality CAD therapy Beijing C-AUC .</brief_summary>
