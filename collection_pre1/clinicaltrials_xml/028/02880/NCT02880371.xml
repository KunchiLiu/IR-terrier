	<detailed_description>ARRY-382 inhibitor CSF1R ( colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor ) . Each part study consist 28-day screening period , 21-day treatment cycle disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , death ( discontinuation criterion meet ) , 30-day safety follow-up period . Patients monitor overall survival ( OS ) 1 year date last patient 's first visit .</detailed_description>
