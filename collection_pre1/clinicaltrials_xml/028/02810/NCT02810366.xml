	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Most death low middle-income country occur hospital without medical attention certification time death . Hence , information cause death ( COD ) lack . In setting , verbal autopsy ( VAs ) , typically involve lay non-medical interview live family member close associate decease detail death , subsequent assignment COD physician , use estimate COD pattern . Although VA commonly use acquire community-based COD data , application mode assignment COD may vary . The choice physician-certified verbal autopsy ( PCVA ) cod versus computer-coded verbal autopsy method ( CCVA ) widely debate . Both method limitation . While PCVA method suffer inter intra-observer difference cod addition physician time consumption expense , accuracy CCVA method faster less expensive PCVA assess different setting . A literature search yield one study systematically assess performance four computer-coded verbal autopsy method COD assignment compare physician cod VAs 24,000 death low middle-income country ( Miasnikof et al . 2015 ) . Here investigator propose first ever randomise control trial assess PCVA versus CCVA population level . STUDY DESIGN This randomise control trial conduct three state India ; total 12,500 death occur last five year collect via VA . In district ( five district across three state - see ) , 50 % death randomly select PCVA rest CCVA . The COD distribution group compare within district . If performance PCVA CCVA comparable , attained distribution similar . Study district India ( x number anticipate VAs collect approx . number household ) : - Amravati , Maharashtra ( 2500 VAs ~12,500 household ) - Anand Kheda district , Gujarat ( 5000 VAs ~25,000 household ) - Sangrur Mansa district , Punjab ( 5000 VAs ~25,000 household ) OBJECTIVES - Primary Objective : To assess physician versus computer cod VAs population level - Do computer algorithms perform well physician cod VAs determine COD distribution population level . - Secondary Objective : To assess quality physician versus lay surveyor VA data collection - Does quality symptom information collect final COD assign differ physician versus lay person carry VA data collection . - Tertiary Objective : To assess household preference short VA questionnaire narrative versus long questionnaire without narrative - Which VA instrument household prefer . DATA COLLECTION Data collection study proceed two phase . - Phase 1 : Enumeration VA ( short questionnaire narrative , long questionnaire narrative ) lay data collector . VA questionnaire design base World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommendation . - Phase 2 : Physician re-sampling 50 % VAs use PCVA The data collect use laptop/tablet electronic format local language . Quality control/Quality Assurance : 1 . Random 2-5 % case re-interviewed surveyor Quality Control Survey 2 . An audio recording entire data collection do quality control monitoring . ANALYSIS PLAN - Primary Objective : COD 50 % VAs assign trained physician use Million Death Study ( MDS ) physician cod system ; include dual , independent cod VA record , disagreement resolve reconciliation , remain case adjudication third physician . The assignment CODs line international classification disease version 10 ( ICD-10 ) . The remain 50 % death independently assign COD five lead CCVA algorithm . If performance PCVA CCVA comparable , attain COD distribution population level similar , `` similarity '' assess calculate Cause Specific Mortality Fraction ( CSMF ) Accuracy algorithm 's COD assignment district CSMF PCVAs respective district . - Secondary Objective : Half PCVAs district re-interviewed physician , CODs assign re-interviewed VAs use MDS physician cod system describe . To assess concordance COD assignment lay person physician collect VAs , CSMF Accuracy calculate determine concordance population level , Sensitivity Partial Chance Corrected Concordance ( PCCC ) calculate assess similarity COD assignment individual level . - Tertiary Objective : Respondents cooperation short VA questionnaire narrative versus long questionnaire without narrative assessed determine VA instrument household prefer . A focus group surveyor receive feedback use instrument field also conduct . The result study present three separate trial ( one trial per state ) . The result first trial use hypothesis generation .</detailed_description>
