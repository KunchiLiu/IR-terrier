	<detailed_description>To date , clear consensus reach related default mode network ( DMN ) activity different clinical type MS. Due controversy literature regard increment decrement DMN activity along natural history MS evolution , study aim add experimental information data might help disentangle paradox , also correlate DMN activity anatomic cognitive index . The investigator also introduce novel experimental design , include prospective measure investigator connectivity cognitive measure . In study , investigator aim evaluate connectivity regardless whether patient present clinical type require medical treatment . In point , patient progressive evolution well initial form disease ( CIS ) include properly establish form MS RR form . Researchers focus medical treatment clinical form indication disease modify drug . Nevertheless , investigator consider study connectivity worth regardless pharmacological treatment . The investigator also aim offer data natural history MS evolution distinct MS type patient healthy control , study plan collect data longitudinally .</detailed_description>
