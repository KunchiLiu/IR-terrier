	<brief_title>Treatment Temporo-Myofascial Disorder Muscular Origin Using Botulinum Toxin : A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) group condition involve temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) , masticatory muscle associate structure . This broad complex functional disorder often affect face jaw cause chronic pain , earache , headache , migraine , neck pain , dysfunction many people 1,2,3,4,5,6 . Conservative treatment TMD similar musculoskeletal condition . Pharmacologic therapy include use anti-inflammatory medication , muscle relaxant , opioid analgesics7,8,9,10 . Physical treatment comprise dental splint , direct physiotherapy , moist heat therapy , soft diet , massage acupuncture11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 . At extreme end spectrum , surgical management include arthrocentesis , arthroscopy open joint procedures26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44 . Some patient find relief combination previously mention intervention ; however , none proven consistently effective . Open joint procedure reversible anti-inflammatory medication narcotic undesirable side effect gastrointestinal central nervous system , respectively . Furthermore , many patient suffer severe chronic pain feel relief even strong narcotic analgesics45,46 . TMD complex etiology consist component internal derangement joint , arthralgia and/or component myofascial pain muscle hyperactivity1,2,3,4 . A treatment high specificity low side effect direct solely muscular aspect , present sign symptom trigger point , clenching , bruxism , could produce another avenue intervention significant potential . Recently , use botulinum toxin proven effective potential agent treatment patient suffer TMD orofacial pain conditions47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 . Botulinum toxins exotoxin derive Clostridium botulinum , gram-positive , anaerobic , spore-forming organism . There 8 different subtypes ; type A ( BTX-A ) use recent study treatment motor disorder cervical dystonia hyperactive muscular component TMD53,54,55 . The specific method action botulinum toxin peripheral synapsis . In synaptic cleft , botulinum toxin bring presynaptic cell endocytosis . It act block calcium induce release acetylcholine selective proteolysis synaptomal-associated protein ( SNAP ) 47,48,4,50,51,52,53,54,55 . Inhibition acytelcholine thus cause inhibition muscular hyperactivity . Botulinum toxin number indication approve Food Drug Administration therapeutic treatment cervical dystonia , cosmetic use glabellar line wide spectrum off-label us extracervical spasticity , cerebral palsy , post stroke spasticity , neurologic , dermatologic , gastrointestinal disorders56 . Off-label use license drug biologic product occur wide range products57,58,59 . Objective Study We aim treat TMD muscular origin use Botulinum toxin injection trigger point . Method Our study enroll selective patient attend Oral Maxillofacial Surgery clinic Health Sciences Center University Manitoba College Dentistry 2-year period . Subjects recruit referral come Health Sciences Center College Dentistry . The design prospective study follow subjective outcome pain orofacial function visual analog scale well objective outcome maximal interincisal mouth opening , tenderness palpation temporalis masseter muscle , maximal bite force measure electromyogram reduction muscle bulk due muscle disuse atrophy . These outcome appreciable affect patient 's quality life provide subjective objective measurement analysis study . Inclusion criteria patient 's enrolled study include : participant 's trigger point masticatory muscle include , limited : masseter temporalis either bilateral unilateral secondly , try conservative management least 3 month show refractory intervention . Exclusion criterion include : participant 's satisfy inclusion criterion , currently breastfeed pregnant , participant 's whose TMD muscular origin , inability speak understand English , inability provide meaningful informed consent due physical , cognitive psychiatric disability , previous know allergy Botulinum toxin , multiple sclerosis , pre-existing neuromuscular disorder , Lambert-Eaton syndrome , chronic centrally mediate neuralgic pain patient . Before enrollment , informed consent obtain patient . Informed consent consist thorough initial evaluation interview . If patient assess appropriate study patient inform risk potential consequence study . Additional information give regard benefit , cost time require . During informed consent , principal investigator least one supervisor attendance answer question . Patients allow time think decision discus family member family physician . A future appointment make obtain consent witness principal investigator , supervisor OMFS assistant connection study . On initial assessment , multiple measurement take ( see clinical assessment form attach ) . Additionally , appointment make patient maximal bite force register pre-injection use EMG . BTX-A reconstitute directed manufacturer . 2.5 mL diluent ( 0.9 % Saline ) per 100 U vial use reconstitute solution swirl . This create solution concentration 4 U/0.1 mL . Patients seat usual precaution sterility skin preparation complete ( i.e . alcohol wipe ) Injections administer unilateral and/or bilaterally accordance topography correspond muscle ( temporalis masseter ) area maximal tenderness pain . Plastic single use insulin syringe 30 gauge needle use inject 30 U intramuscularly masseter , divide evenly 5 site 20 U inject temporalis , divide evenly 5 site . Injections complete principal investigator supervisor train botulinum toxin injection . Patients schedule follow ups 1 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month post-injection . An additional follow call make next day injection . The clinical assessment form use principal investigator take measurement follow appointment , except EMG reading do initial assessment 3 month follow appointment . This provide total 5 assessment ( include initial assessment ) . During time period , patient ask stop treatment TMD analgesic require . Subjective pain score assess visual analog scale ( VAS ) 0 pain 10 bad facial jaw pain 've ever experience . Subjective functional assessment also assess VAS 0 mean limitation 10 indicate severe limitation scale chew , drinking , exercise , eat hard food , eat soft food , smile laughing , clean teeth , yawn , swallow talk . Objectively , range motion assess Boley gauge upper lower incisor time . Palpation tenderness objectively assessed bilateral temporalis masseter muscle . Pain pressure rank 0 5 , 0 indicate pain 5 represent extreme debilitate pain . Addition score give composite score overall facial tenderness maximal score 24 ( 2 area X 6 score X bilaterally ) . All assessment complete examiner every time time day . Lastly , measurement facial width take . A point inferior ear lobule bilaterally mark well point menton choose record . The distance unilaterally one lobule menton measure leave right side total distance also calculate assess facial width . This used determine cosmetic change due disuse atrophy 60 . Side effect may include , limited : transient facial asymmetry dynamic movement , dysphagia , ptosis , erythematous discoloration edema injection site , rash , difficulty chew hard food 61 . Every attempt make insure injection botulinum appropriate site . Aspiration injection help prevent intravascular systemic effect proper patient position proper site identification help prevent unwanted side effect ptosis . If rash develops , Benadryl first line medication give immediately followed several day course Benadryl home . In case emergent reaction , adequate management would undertake clinic referral appropriate service necessary . Due passage across placenta , use pregnancy also contraindicate . All patient 's currently breastfeed pregnant exclude study62 . Funding study provide application research grant The University Manitoba Canadian Association Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons . Anticipated result We expect trigger point patient disappear associate muscle become partially paralyzed relaxed . Consequently , expect TMJ load reduce patient 's overall functional ability increase . We also expect muscular hypertrophy volume hyperactivity decrease due disuse atrophy impact cosmetic image positively . Overall , hope change result reduction pain headache consequently improve participant 's diet , nutrition , psychological well quality life . We expect study publish International Journal Oral Maxillofacial Surgery result present International meeting Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons 2018 .</detailed_description>
