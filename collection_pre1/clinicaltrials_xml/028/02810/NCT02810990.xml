	<detailed_description>Bosutinib potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) active nM concentration BCR-ABL1 BCR-ABL1 mutation . Bosutinib approve FDA EMA treatment patient Ph+/BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia fail treatment TKIs , first second line . The goal second-line treatment CML achieve response would predict survival equal , close , survival non leukemic people , say achieve complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR ) major molecular response ( MMR ) . To achieve goal , necessary find keep right balance activity , safety , tolerability . There study compare TKIs second-line . From phase 2 , single-arm , study , report efficacy Bosutinib similar report efficacy dasatinib nilotinib . The median age newly diagnose CML patient 56 year , least 40 % newly diagnose patient 60 year old . Particularly patient , choice TKI must take account safety tolerability profile TKIs . The use dasatinib nilotinib burden pleural pulmonary complication , infection , cardiovascular , thrombotic metabolic ( diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia ) complication . These complication frequent clinically relevant elderly . The safety tolerability Bosutinib report first- well second- third-line . The standard dose ( 500 mg daily ) tolerate safe , dose several adverse event ( AEs ) limit tolerability , require dose reduction interruption , affect patient quality life , include diarrhea , nausea , vomit , skin rash . Also increase AST , ALT lipase concern cause treatment discontinuation . On contrary , increased frequency infection pleuro-pulmonary , cardiovascular , thrombotic , metabolic AEs report . The report hematologic toxicity Bosutinib least low , even low , report TKIs , spite fact Bosutinib dual , BCR-ABL1 src inhibitor . Until today , study TKIs CML test fixed initial dose , provide dose adjustment case toxicity ( dose decrease ) case unsatisfactory response ( dose increase ) . No study far design test adaptation dose response , take advantage fact efficacy TKI treatment assess rapidly precisely measure BCR-ABL1 transcript level real-time PCR ( RT-PCR ) peripheral blood cell . An RT-PCR monthly first month provide best assessment response treatment . We predict flexible strategy treatment ( adapt dose response ) result convenient balance activity toxicity , hence well outcome . Based premise , propose test activity , safety , tolerability Bosutinib , second-line , begin low dose adjust subsequent dos base molecular response , AEs , population elderly patient . In almost prior study TKIs second- third-line , primary efficacy assess use cytogenetic response , major complete , different time point . To make result study comparable result prior study , cytogenetic response evaluate specified section 5 , since response therapy evaluation efficacy therapy base molecular response , dose adaptation efficacy evaluation base primarily molecular response .</detailed_description>
