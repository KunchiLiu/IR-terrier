	<brief_summary>Around one child fifty lazy eye ( termed amblyopia ) eye structurally normal vision fail develop correctly . Around half child also squint ( strabismus ) eye different direction gaze . This condition commonest cause visual impairment one eye child . This randomise control trial wear glass alone ( result visual improvement , term refractive adaptation ) wearing glass combine use I-BiT Plus . The hypothesis use I-BiT Plus result improve visual outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Interactive Binocular Treatment ( I-BiT ) Management Anisometropic , Strabismic Mixed Amblyopia Children Aged 3.5 - 12 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study treat amblyopia ( lazy eye ) use 3-D computer technology active shutter glass . Computer game DVD 's view active shutter glass specially prepare preferentially stimulate lazy eyeÍ¾ child play game accurately use lazy eye . The study fund NIHR undertaken randomise control trial compare normal computer game DVD viewing combine continue refractive adaptation ( process know occur 30 week ) . Patients receive 6 week treatment ( recommend 30 min minimum play time per day 6 week treatment arm ) level vision assess 6 week visual improvement ( wear glass also undergo refractive adaptation ) compare control . Patients return standard care trial period , 6 week , affect final visual outcome negative way . The participant recruit patient currently attend one 4 trial site diagnosis amblyopia , age 3 year 6 month 9 year 11 month . Current treatment amblyopia include wear eye patch good eye 6 hour per day , use eye drop blur image good eye period 4 week time . The aim avoid need patch penalisation ( unpopular treatment ) get improve visual outcome . Assessment study : A study 62 patient investigator compare visual acuity , angle strabismus , stereoacuity depth suppression estimate I-BiT measurement make orthoptic assessment . This data help interpret result randomise controlled trial help direct future development .</detailed_description>
