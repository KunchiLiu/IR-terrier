The trial test complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package include standardized public health evaluation analysis , identify problem barrier limit Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis treatment among close contact active Tuberculosis case . This follow implementation appropriate solution . The primary objective study increase proportion start Latent Tuberculosis Infection treatment among household contact patient active pulmonary .

After initial preparation , include administrative ethical review , participate site randomize intervention control . Immediately , Phase 1 begin intervention sty standardize public health evaluation identify barrier LTBI diagnosis treatment initiation selection solution use Phase 2 . To ensure standardization data gather research staff use ( ) current indicator Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade care intervention facility ( number contact per index case register , investigate , start treatment complete treatment ) ( ii ) interviewer administer questionnaire patient active pulmonary Tuberculosis , adult child household contact clinic staff . These questionnaire assess latent Tuberculosis-related knowledge , attitude beliefs perspective different participant . Results intervention sit Phase 1 analyze , use investigator , together local public health official , decide appropriate corrective solution site .
