	<brief_summary>Gastric regurgitation increase risk pulmonary aspiration surgical patient receive general anesthesia depression gastro-esophageal reflux . In addition , patient may high risk aspiration result reduce gastric empty gastroesophageal reflux , prolong surgical time , laparoscopic surgery . Second-generation supraglottic airway device ( SAD ) provide additional channel facilitate drainage gastric content prevent aspiration , routinely used surgery . Currently , multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH ( MII-pH ) monitoring , combine multiple impedance channel conventional pH catheter , regard sensitive technique detect reflux event . Therefore , application MII-pH monitoring SAD-based general anesthesia may help detect ongoing reflux/regurgitation esophagus patient perioperative period . The hypothesis present study occurrence gastroesophageal regurgitation general anesthesia may influence several factor , abdominal insufflation laparoscopy , longer surgical time , Trendelenburg position , high body weight , etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators aim observe occurrence gastroesophageal regurgitation continuous monitoring novel technique MII-pH perioperative period variety common surgical procedure SAD-based general anesthesia pilot study . Furthermore , investigator also determine factor associate occurrence gastroesophageal regurgitation various surgical procedure general anesthesia . Investigators include patient receive schedule surgery SAD-based general anesthesia age &gt; = 20 enrol . All subject provide basic demographic data fill standard symptom questionnaire evaluation baseline severity gastroesophageal reflux associate gastrointestinal sleep symptom . Supraglottic airway device i-gel inserted establish airway , gastric content suction esophageal vent i-gel . MII-pH catheter insert though esophageal vent i-gel detect characterize gastroesophageal reflux event perioperative period . After removal SAD , patient follow saturation , sore throat hoarseness postoperative care unit , well possible complication . Investigators elucidate clinical characteristic risk factor patient receive elective surgery , also determine severity gastric regurgitation intraoperative period . Investigators correlate reflux pattern , frequency , content proximal extent reflux event symptom correlation clinical feature intraoperative period . The study result could help u study gastric regurgitation perioperative period .</detailed_description>
