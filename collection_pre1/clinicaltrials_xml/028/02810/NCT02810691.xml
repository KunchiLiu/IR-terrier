	<detailed_description>With improved survival , clinical spectrum cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , complex multi systemic disease , continue evolve . A major emerge complication CF relate diabetes ( CFRD ) . CFRD major co-morbidity occur 20 % adolescent 40-50 % adult mainly due reduce insulin secretion . Patients develop CFRD increase risk morbidity mortality also face increase medical burden insulin therapy , recommend treatment . Because accelerated decline weight and/or pulmonary function start 2 4 year CFRD onset period characterize frequent Post-Prandial Glycemic ( PPG ) excursion , role PPG excursion clinical deterioration investigate . The investigator show high PPG excursion associate low pulmonary function others show PPG excursion predict future CFRD risk . Food overconsumption discourage form diabetes avoid overweight obesity , also prevent increase insulin demand . In contrast , nutritional approach patient CF focus high-energy high-fat diet meet increase energy requirement . In combination appropriate pancreatic enzyme supplementation , approach contributes significantly improve nutritional status , lung function survival patient . However , diet also contribute increase PPG excursion . Based beneficial effect nutrition therapy improve PPG form pre-diabetes diabetes , extend benefit patient CF important . In context high CF treatment burden , approach however simple induce weight loss . The investigator aim test feasibility effectiveness viscous fiber supplement reduce PPG adult patient CF . Using randomized crossover design , investigator study impact two dos viscous fiber supplement compare placebo control condition , 22 patient , 8 hour , research center 2 standardized mixed-meals : breakfast lunch PPG excursion .</detailed_description>
