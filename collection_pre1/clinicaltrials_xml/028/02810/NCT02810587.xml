	<brief_title>Endophthalmitis After Intravitreous Anti-VEGF Injections Patients Receiving vs. Not Receiving Topical Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreous anti-VEGF injection common procedure perform eye clinic worldwide . It become gold standard treatment many macular disease , diabetic macular edema neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . One serious complication intravitreous injection post-injection endophthalmitis . There proven preventive strategy post-injection endophthalmitis except use povidone iodine . However , number physician around world prescribe topical antibiotic injection , despite lack evidence support benefit topical antibiotic prevent occurence endophthalmitis . Recently , many large trial US include Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) , Comparison AMD Treatment Trials ( CATT ) study report incidence post-injection endophthalmitis compare eye receive versus receive post-injection antibiotic , result study suggest topical antibiotic help reduce incidence post-injection endophthalmitis . In addition , result suggest eye receive antibiotic higher rate endophthalmitis compare receive antibiotic . Therefore , majority physician United States stop prescribe antibiotic drop follow injection . However , majority physician Asia-Pacific region still prescribe antibiotic drop follow injection ( accord Preferences Trends ( PAT ) survey American Society Retina Specialists 2014 ) . Due limit evidence Asian literature whether difference incidence endophthalmitis follow intravitreous anti-VEGF injection eye receive antibiotic drop versus receive antibiotic drops Asian setting , investigator conduct study determine incidence endophthalmitis intravitreous anti-VEGF injection , compare eye receive post-injection antibiotic versus receive . Results study would beneficial guide appropriate practice physician Asian region .</detailed_description>
