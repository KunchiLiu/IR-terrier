	<detailed_description>Protocol Title : Focal Breast Pain : Does normal ultrasound provide reassurance ? Purpose Study : The investigator hypothesize benign direct ultrasound , perform normal digital mammogram , provide woman focal breast pain additional reassurance etiology symptom benign . Background &amp; Significance : Breast pain one common symptom woman seek medical care . While 80 % woman experience breast pain point life , commonly breast pain result benign etiology trauma , infection , pregnancy , lactation , simple cyst . In contrast , breast cancer report 7 % woman present focal breast pain . Despite uncommon association breast cancer focal breast pain , diagnostic imaging workup often request . Current American College Radiology ( ACR ) Appropriateness Criteria guideline rate use mammography ultrasound evaluation non-cyclical , focal , unilateral bilateral breast pain patient 30 year old `` may appropriate . '' Traditionally mammography ultrasound perform woman age 30 , present noncyclical , focal breast pain image often exclude treatable benign cause pain and/or provide reassurance . The investigator recently complete retrospective study evaluate utility digital mammography direct ultrasound woman focal breast pain . It observe perform direct ultrasound follow digital mammography potentially beneficial woman mammographically dense breast tissue . In contrast , investigator demonstrate direct ultrasound conjunction digital mammography low utility woman non-dense breast tissue . These finding suggest direct ultrasound might unnecessary work focal breast pain woman non-dense breast tissue . However , anecdotal evidence direct ultrasound yield benign finding follow normal digital mammogram might reassure woman cause focal breast pain benign . These potential psychological benefit may drive continue use ultrasound work focal breast pain , even though diagnostic utility low . Design Procedures : Subject Selection , Recruitment , Compensation The study team ( Principal investigator ( PI ) , Co-PI , Study coordinator ) select 160 woman , present Breast Imaging Clinic evaluation focal breast pain 3/1/2016 - 7/1/2018 . Inclusion criterion include woman age 30 primary focal breast pain , i.e . pain localizable patient within one breast quadrant without associate symptom . Women diffuse , radiate , axillary pain , associate palpable finding site pain , skin change ( erythema , thicken ) nipple change ( discharge , retraction ) , currently pregnant breast-feeding , history recent trauma infection affect breast , history ipsilateral breast cancer exclude . Based investigator 's clinical judgement , investigator anticipates minimum effect size d=.4 anxiety . A sample size n =80 per group ( total n = 160 ) power 0.8 detect difference effect size d=.4 use one-tailed alpha = .05 . Study participant include woman refer image focal breast pain woman report focal breast pain technologist radiologist prior image . Once patient identify possible candidate , PI , Co-PI , study coordinator look electronic medical record , Epic . see meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . If none , patient approach see willing participate study . While number patient present typical week Duke focal breast pain study , anecdotally , approximately 1-2 patient per day evaluate focal breast pain . Study participant compensate . Consent Process Study participant include woman refer image focal breast pain woman report focal breast pain technologist radiologist prior image . Once patient identify possible candidate , PI , Co-PI , study coordinator look Epic see meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . If none , patient approach see willing participate study . Only member study team ( Karen Johnson , MD , Lars Grimm , MD , Michael Cho , MD ) approach potential participant consent process . If member study team available , potential subject recruit . Subjects able provide legally effective consent recruit . While number patient present typical week Duke focal breast pain study , anecdotally , approximately 1-2 patient per day evaluate focal breast pain . This study serve 3/2 research project Michael Cho , MD . Dr. Cho request 37 week dedicate research time 4th year recruit patient . Dr. Cho continue recruit patient Breast image fellowship need . As , Dr. Cho primarily responsible consent process . Dr. Cho work Steve Shipes learn consent process Maestro data entry . Study Design Once patient volunteer participate , investigator utilize block randomization technique randomize study participant two group ( Group A B ) , ensure comparable number across study group . The patient consent . Pertinent demographic medical data also collect . All include study participant ask complete short survey , base State Anxiety scale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) ( 18 ) . This survey primarily assess psychosocial metric , include , limited anxiety , comfort , level concern malignancy . All study participant receive digital mammogram , standard care patient present focal breast pain . Patients image correlate focal breast pain ( Breast imaging-reporting data system ( BI-RADS ) 1 2 ) continue study . Patients image find site focal pain ( BI-RADS 0 , 4 , 5 ) exclude study receive standard care appropriate imaging finding . Women BI-RADS 1 2 digital mammogram proceed study inform imaging finding . Study participant randomize Group A receive mammogram result Breast image fellow fellowship train Breast image radiologist . Participants Group B receive mammogram result Breast image fellow fellowship train Breast image radiologist additionally receive direct ultrasound area focal pain , standard care focal breast pain . All study participant ask complete second survey , base State Anxiety scale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory . Participants Groups A receive direct ultrasound breast end visit ensure woman receive standard care . One research collaborator approach subject group A follow 2nd survey disclose minor deception explain subject necessity deception purpose study . The collaborator also explain current standard care patient focal breast pain target ultrasound . The standard care ultrasound perform Breast image fellow fellowship train breast radiologist . Risk/Benefit Assessment The risk study believe minimal , include potential loss confidentiality . The digital mammogram direct ultrasound patient receive standard practice woman focal breast pain . Women study would receive imaging test regardless participation study therefore potential risk image consider additional risk study . Costs Subject : There project direct financial cost subject involve study . Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations : The result survey compare appropriate statistical analysis include limited analysis variance multiple two sample t-tests conduct determine statistically significant difference three randomize group . Data &amp; Safety Monitoring : There anticipated safety concern . The study coordinator ( MC ) responsible data collection storage . Paper survey store locked cabinet Breast imaging reading room ( Cancer Center Room 2S33 ) Cancer Center Breast Imaging Department ( Clinic 2-1 ) accessible badge . Any digital data store encrypted external hard drive ( Western Digital ) backup Duke approve cloud storage ( Box ) DTHS manage share drive . Privacy , Data Storage &amp; Confidentiality : A de-identification code assign patient use identifier . The link code identify subject kept duration study securely store encrypted external hard drive ( Western Digital ) backup Duke approve cloud storage ( Box ) DTHS manage share drive .</detailed_description>
