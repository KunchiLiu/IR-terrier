	<brief_summary>After perform power calculation , healthy adult participant study randomly allocate two group . The intervention group receive minimally invasive surgical technique ( MIST ) enamel matrix derivative ( Emdogain ) treatment intrabony periodontal defect . The control group receive minimally invasive surgical technique ( MIST ) without enamel matrix derivative ( Emdogain ) . Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) gain periodontal pocket depth ( PPD ) reduction well position gingival margin ( REC ) main outcome radiographic intrabony infill , bleed probe ( BoP ) , full mouth plaque score ( FMPS ) full mouth bleed score ( FMBS ) secondary outcome record participant 3 examiner three stage : 1 . Before procedure baseline record . 2 . 6 month surgery , parameter EXCEPT intra oral periapical ( PA ) radiograph . 3 . 12 month surgery . The reading record use The University Michigan O Probe William 's Calibration OR Pressure Sensitive Periodontal Probe 0.3 N near millimeter clinical attachment level gain ( CAL ) , periodontal pocket depth ( PPD ) position gingival margin ( REC ) , present absent bleed probe ( BoP ) , intra oral periapical ( PA ) radiograph crestal bone level assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using MIST With Without EMD Treatment Intrabony Periodontal Defects .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The surgical procedure appointment take probably 45-75 minute . The procedure take follow step : 1 . One Intra-oral periapical radiograph/X-ray take procedure another one month 12 . 2 . Providing local anesthetic numb area work select site need general anesthesia . 3 . Using micro surgical blade cut gum conservatively , use conservative minimally invasive surgical technique up-to-date . 4 . After establish visibility defective site help dental loups part procedure , clean whole area use manual ultrasonic cleaning instrument make sure granulation ( infected/inflamed ) tissue inside defect root surface affect tooth/teeth smooth . 5 . In case use enamel matrix derivative gel ( Emdogain ) apply material manufacturer recommend , case use enamel matrix derivative gel ( Emdogain ) standard open flap debridement ( OFD ) scale root planning affect site close secure flap/wound exactly minimally invasive surgical technique . 6 . According technique use use suitable type suture material technique make sure flap/wound close place secure properly . 7 . At end procedure patient receive post-operative instruction kind Do 's &amp; Do n't follow : A . Do n't clean wound next 2 week . B . Using chlorhexidine base mouth wash 0.12 % twice day 3 week . C. Do n't eat drink hot food drink first 2 day , may start use warm food back normal week time . C. Do n't play disturb suture tongue , lips finger . D. Try exercise 1st week . E. Do brush rest teeth . 8 . The participant ask attend 15 minute appointment 7-10 day right procedure suture removal . Then every two week month 3 evaluation heal perform kind treatment might need example ; superficial cleaning . Then ask attend one appointment month month 6 take measurement provide cleaning need , month 9 , finally , month 12 take measurement last time compare baseline measurement .</detailed_description>
