	<brief_summary>Background : LMB-100 man-made protein design kill cancer cell . LMB-100 target cancer marker call mesothelin . Mesothelin find surface many different tumor , include pancreatic cancer , make small number normal tissue . After bind mesothelin tumor , LMB-100 attack kill cancer cell . Researchers want see well work give nab-paclitaxel , treats pancreatic cancer . Objectives : To find safe dose LMB-100 fixed standard dose nab-paclitaxel people advance pancreatic cancer . To see well combination two drug reduce tumor size . Eligibility : Adults age 18 older advance pancreatic cancer worsen anti-cancer therapy . Design : Participants screen medical history physical exam . They give blood , urine , tissue sample . They scan x-ray . During 21-day cycle : Participants get LMB-100 IV catheter day 1 , 3 , 5 . This tube insert vein , usually arm . Participants get nab-paclitaxel IV day 1 8 . They get combination 4 cycle disease worsen intolerable side effect . Participants blood urine test scan throughout study . Participants safety follow-up visit 6 week treatment end . If disease remain stable improves , scan every 6 week disease get bad . Even disease get bad , doctor call talk cancer status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesothelin-Targeted Immunotoxin LMB-100 Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel People With Previously Treated Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Pancreatic cancer fourth common cause cancer death United States , claim 40,000 life year . - Incidence nearly equal mortality 6 % participant live five year beyond diagnosis . Most patient diagnose advanced stage , even patient early stage disease long term survival le 20 % . - Mesothelin specifically marker adenocarcinoma human disease express precede pre-malignant stage tumor development - Expression mesothelin pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) examine several publish study range 86 100 % - Recombinant immunotoxins ( RITs ) antibody-based therapeutic carry toxin payload . RITs target mesothelin contain genetically engineer variant Pseudomonas exotoxin A ( PE ) native cell-binding domain PE replace mesothelin-binding antibody fragment . SS1P first mesothelin-targeted RIT test patient . - LMB-100 contains newly engineer PE fragment improve activity pancreatic cancer cell line vitro , also much less toxic SS1P preclinical model . The new PE contain modification specifically design reduce immunogenicity molecule . - Pre-administration paclitaxel SS1P demonstrate increase amount immunotoxin internalized tumor cell reduce level shed mesothelin intra-tumoral environment immunotoxin could bind tumor cell . The effect even pronounce NAB-paclitaxel pancreatic cancer model . - Initial clinical test LMB-100 perform Roche multi-center international first human trial ( NCT02317419 ) . The agent well tolerate appear decreased immunogenicity compare SS1P base preliminary result . Primary Objectives : - Phase I : -- To determine maximum tolerate dose LMB-100 combination nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy participant advance pancreatic cancer - Phase II : - To determine objective response rate ( PR+CR ) accord RECIST 1.1 criterion LMB-100 combination nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy participant advance pancreatic cancer Eligibility : - Age great equal to18 year - Histologically confirm recurrent , metastatic and/or advance pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - Treatment must include least one prior chemotherapy regimen - No nab-paclitaxel paclitaxel treatment last four month - Adequate organ function - Participants HIV , active HBV HCV infection exclude Design : - This study Phase I/II open label study assess safety efficacy LMB-100 combination standard care agent nab-paclitaxel participant metastatic and/or locally advance pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - Subjects treat 4 cycle - In phase I portion study , 3 dose level evaluate . LMB-100 administered day 1 , 3 5 21 day cycle nab-paclitaxel administered day 1 8 - In phase II portion study , 20 evaluable participant ( include treat MTD phase I study ) enrol . - The phase II study conduct Simon Minimax two stage phase II design . The first stage enroll 13 evaluable participant , include six participant treat MTD phase I . If 1 response , accrual would continue total 20 evaluable participant enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histologically confirm recurrent , advance metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma determine NCI Laboratory Pathology . Measurable and/or evaluable disease per RECIST Criteria v 1.1 Participants must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen disease , paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel within 4 month prior initiation study therapy . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use LMB100 combination nabpaclitaxel person &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 2 . Participants must 14 day remove recent minor surgical procedure ( biliary stenting ) , 28 day recent major surgical procedure radiation treatment , 14 day remove recent chemotherapy experimental drug treatment publish halflife know 72 hour less 28 day remove last experimental drug treatment unpublished halflife great 72 hour . All acute toxic effect prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , experimental drug treatment surgical procedure must resolve Grade le equal 1 , except alopecia ( grade ) . Adequate hematological function : neutrophil count great equal 1.0 time 10 ( 9 ) cells/L , platelet count great equal 100,000/microl , hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Serum albumin great equal 2.5 mg/dL without intravenous supplementation Adequate liver function : Bilirubin , AST ALT &lt; 2.5 time ULN Adequate renal function : creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min . Must leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % Must ambulatory oxygen saturation &gt; 88 % room air The effect LMB100 combination nabpaclitaxel develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry 3 month thelast dose study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability participant understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Known clinically suspect CNS 2.1.2.1 primary tumor metastases include leptomeningeal metastasis . History clinical evidence CNS metastases unless previously treat , asymptomatic , requirement steroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant last 14 day . Evidence significant , uncontrolled concomitant disease could affect compliance protocol interpretation result , include significant pulmonary disease related primary cancer , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , and/or significant cardiovascular disease ( New York Heart Association Class III IV cardiac disease , myocardial infarction within last 6 month , unstable arrhythmia , unstable angina , clinically significant pericardial effusion ) Any known diagnosis , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition ( pancreatic adenocarcinoma ) would contraindicate use investigational drug , interfere tumor measurement lead expect life expectancy le 6 month judge investigator Active uncontrolled infection . Live attenuate vaccination within 14 day prior treatment HIV active HBV HCV infection due risk progression receive immunosuppressive chemotherapy Dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent Pregnant woman exclude study effect LMB100 develop fetus unknown may potential cause teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother LMB100 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated LMB100 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Known hypersensitivity component LMB100 Baseline QTcF interval &gt; 470 m , participant baseline rest bradycardia &lt; 45 beat per minute , baseline rest tachycardia &gt; 100 beat per minute . Participants contraindication and/or history severe hypersensitivity reaction nabpaclitaxel Participants baseline peripheral neuropathy grade 2</criteria>
