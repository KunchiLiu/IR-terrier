	<brief_summary>Background : Theta-burst stimulation ( TBS ) , form repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) hold promise effective treatment treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) . rTMS link neuroplastic change show use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Alterations serotonin-1A receptor expression ( 5-HT1A ) link major depression . Moreover , change 5-HT1A receptor bind - observed pharmacological treatment , well electroconvulsive therapy - link neuronal adaptation response antidepressant treatment . Objectives study : Here , aim investigate effect TBS leave right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 5-HT1A receptor bind patient TRD use PET . In addition , effect iTBS brain structure function determine use functional , structural perfusion MRI . Study population : 80 patient TRD maintain original medication regimen recruit . Study design : Longitudinal , randomized double-blind clinical trial . 40 patient receive active TBS , 40 patient receive sham TBS treatment duration three week . Before three week treatment , patient scan use MRI PET highly specific selective radiotracer [ carbonyl-11C ] WAY100635 . A follow-up visit final examination perform 2 4 week treatment active TBS group , respectively . Patients sham TBS arm receive active TBS treatment immediately second MRI PET scan . Relevance implication study : This worldwide first multimodal image study investigate effect TBS serotonin-1A receptor bind TRD use PET . Thus , study add crucial knowledge exist literature effect TMS brain structure function , relate antidepressant efficacy . Moreover , combine molecular image serotonergic neurotransmission structural functional MRI , propose study increase investigator knowledge serotonergic role shape brain morphology , microstructure structural/functional connectivity . Taken together , study potential contribute development personalize treatment , reduction personal suffering reduction cost occupational disability .</brief_summary>
