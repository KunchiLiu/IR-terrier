	<brief_summary>There specific treatment core symptom PWS . Regarding behavioral psychiatric symptom ( hyperphagia , imulsivity self-mutilations ) , one drug option consist antipsychotic , efficient might responsible worsen weight gain ( major issue PWS ) . An alternative therapeutic approach behavioral disturbance suggest author topiramate ( Epitomax® ) , antiepileptic drug use mood stabilizer anti-impulsive . In addition , topiramate use treatment eat disorder induces loss weight appetite . This last effect might useful case SPW . Except clinical case report , investigator find one open study topiramate SPW 8 patientssuggesting promising effect . There si however placebo control study.. Objective : To evaluate efficacy topiramate ( 200 mg / ) Eating disorder ( E ) , self Mutilations ( M ) , irritability Impulsivity ( I ) , metabolic status , tolerance among PWS patient . Methodology : This multicenter ( out-patients Toulouse , Reims , Nantes Paris in-patients Hendaye ) 8 week double-blind placebo control study . Subjects ( n = 125 112 analyzable ) PWS , age 12 years-old follow symptom : E , M U ( see ) . All subject randomly allocate two group one take placebo , take topiramate ( 50mg / day initially , increase 50mg per week 200mg / day ) . The population analyzable patient patient equal size ( n = 56 ) . The inclusion period two years.. Are excluded subject antipsychotic mood stabilizer medication topiramate . The primary endpoint rate responder , response define obtain score 1 2 CGI improvement 8 week treatment Other assessment , secondary endpoint : - Clinic : Weight / Size / Self-injury behavior ( french Echelle de Conduites Auto et Hétéro Aggressives , ECAHA ) ) - Psychometric : C-SHARP A-SHARP / Conners ( Impulsivity ) / Dickens ( Eating behavior PWS ) - Organic : NFS , serum electrolyte , creatinine , ammonia plasma , serum bicarbonate , AST / ALT / GGT , ghrelin , fast glucose , lipid profile insulin , leptin , TG HbA1c . - Side effect topiramate : SAPS / SANS BPRS ( hallucination ) , anxiety scale laboratory test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Topiramate Patients With Prader Willi Syndrome Over 8 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background justification study : Patients rare disease often challenging treat consider psychotropic treatment behavioral psychiatric manifestation . There important lack clear data treatment guideline treat behavioral disturbance patient intellectual disability . Prader Willi syndrome ( PWS ) paradigmatic example disease . It rare disease estimate prevalence 1:25,000 birth . PWS genetic disease locate chromosome 15 ( 15 q11-q13 ) . Imprinting silence normal gene 15 q11-Q13 , render non-functional , paternal non-imprinted gene delete . The imprint effect region explain approximately 60 70 % patient PWS paternal deletion 15q11-q13 ( 2 ) . An additional 25 35 % patient two copy maternal chromosome 15 ( uniparental disomy ) . Rarely , PWS may associate translocation , mutation , anomaly . Angelman Syndrome , primarily associate autism spectrum disorder , involve genetic region commonly associate mutation maternal allele UB3a gene rare deletion . . PWS patient present neonatal hypotonic state deficit suck eat refusal progress hyperphagia obsession food infancy adolescence . In addition , patient distinct facial feature , narrow forehead , almond-shaped eye , triangular mouth , well short stature , related growth hormone deficiency small hand foot . Puberty often delay incomplete , affected individual unable child . This eat disorder similar addictive disorder food traditional eating disorder . PWS lead severe obesity , major issue associate quality life medical prognosis . Psychiatric cognitive symptom patient PWS severe important impact social interpersonal life . Patients PWS often mild moderate intellectual disability ( ID ) , learn impairment poor academic achievement . They particular difficulty mathematics , calculation , abstraction , may relate under-diagnosed neuro-visual impairment . There large individual heterogeneity language impairment , primarily morphosyntaxic ability . Behavioral impairment predominately include temper outburst , impulsivity , emotional liability aggressive behavior , well self-injury behavior , compulsively pick skin mucosa ( rectal picking ) , may lead severe wound severe infection . Patients disomy group severe overall symptom patient deletion . Regarding relationship PWS schizophrenia spectrum disorder ( SSDs ) , 5 study utilized standardized psychometric tool assess psychiatric diagnosis . SSDs primarily , exclusively , associated disomy , clinical diagnosis may complicate . Considering disomy represent 20 % , , patient , SSDs affect less 20 % patient PWS , likely approximately 17 % 15 % . There study field behavioral treatment PWS suggest risperidone psychotic symptom associate disomy , N-acetylcysteine skin picking might efficient . Moreover despite many study limitation , investigator identify promising treatment effect topiramate self-injury impulsive/aggressive behavior . To date one study ( open trial ) topiramate PWS . Our aim ass efficacy tolerance topiramate behavioral disturbance patient PWS . Main objective : Assess efficacy tolerance topiramate 200 mg / day hyperphagia ( H ) , seflf-injury ( SI ) Irritability-Impuslivity Behavior patient Prader Willi Syndrome 8 week follow-up . Secondary objective Assess tolerance side effect ot topiramate 200mg/day specific population . Methodology : The investigator run multicentric double blind placebo control randomized trial outpatient Paris Toulouse inpatients Hendaye . Inclusion period 3 year order obtain total number participant 125 randomly assign two group ( drug v placebo ) . Local Ethic Committee approve research . Patients and/or parent / caregiver give informed consent . Main outcome measure Clinical Global Impression thereshold obtain least 1 CGI Improvement score endpoint 8 week follow-up . Secondary outcome ( psychometric scale biological measure ) : - Weight , Self-Injury Behavior , C-SHARP A-SHARP ( suicide ideation scale , accord age ) , CONNERS Impulsivity , Dickens ( Hyperphagia ) - Sides effect assessment ; PANNS ( hallucination ) , Eysenck Anxiety - And biological assessment include lipid , hepatic enzyme , insulin , serum bicarbonate , leptin , amoniemia , ghreline HbA1c . Instruments assessment . Psychometric scale : Impulsivity aggressive behavior evalauated irritability sub-score Aberrant Behaviour Checklist The Children 's Scale Hostility Aggression : Reactive/Proactive ( C-SHARP ) adolescents 16 years-old The Adult Scale Hostility Aggression : Reactive/Proactive ( A-SHARP ) adult . The Dickens questionnaire , especially orient PWS patient , use eat behavior . Self injury behavior assess Scale Self-Aggressive Behavior ( ECAA Yale-Paris ) , especially sub -scale regard severity , duration frequency behavior . The Clinical Global Impression , use base line , 2 , 4 , 6 8 week ( endpoint ) . Scale Assesment Positive Symptoms , SAPS , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale , BPRS , Hamilton Anxiety Sclale , HAS et Columbia Classification Algorithm Suicide Assessment ( C-CASA ) . Somatic assessment : Blood sample routine element associate complete blood count , creatinin , amoniemia serum bicarbonate , ASAT/ALAT/γGT , glycemia lipid profil insulin , ghrelin , leptin , TG HbA1c . Weight size order calculate Body Mass Index . Centralized blood level drug concentration baseline ( treatment ) , week 4 week 8 . Design timeline : Selection make inclusion/exclusion criterion include blood sample . Inclusion randomization baseline assessment make . Visits schedule week 2 , 4 , 6 8 ( endpoint end patient participation ) . All scale use visit biological sample make selection , inclusion , week 4 week 8 .</detailed_description>
