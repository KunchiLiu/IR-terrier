	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT Recurrence Detection Prostate Cancer Its Impact Patient Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET-CT recently develop molecular imaging technique . It base prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) , transmembrane protein large extracellular domain over-expressed prostate cancer cell surface . Initial experiment use ligand extracellular epitope PSMA label isotope 68Ga , positron emitter ( 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC ) 5 . Recently publish data base 300 patient show recurrence detection rate tumour background ratio high choline PET-CT , even low Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level ( sensitivity 70 % PSA &lt; 2ng/ml ) 6,7 . False-positive PSMA finding yet report . The therapeutic management biochemical recurrence prostate cancer depend localisation extent recurrent disease . In study , hypothesis 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET-CT , high diagnostic accuracy significant impact therapeutic management patient biochemical recurrence . Primary objective : To prospectively evaluate impact PSMA-PET/CT therapeutic management patient biological recurrent prostate cancer negative , equivocal oligometastatic disease routine imaging diagnostic work-up . The treatment management decision record urologic tumor board ( UTB ) PSMA-PET/CT result . Rate decision change calculate . Secondary objective ( ) 1 . To compare detection rate PSMA PET/CT Routine Imaging Workup 2 . To search predictor positive PET scan 3 . To assess diagnostic value PSMA-PET/CT 4 . To assess PSA response target treatment oligometastatic disease . 5 . To evaluate delay start Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) UTB decision . 6 . To evaluate time PSA progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year old . Histologicallyproven prostate adenocarcinoma . Biochemical recurrence ( BCR ) local treatment radical curative intent base PSA value 1 : Following Radical Prostatectomy +/ Radiotherapy : serum PSA increase confirm second PSA measurement high first one value 0.2 ng/mL within minimum one week . Following primary Radiotherapy : PSA value 2 ng/ml nadir . A continued rise PSA level despite treatment curative intent . Patients negative , inconclusive oligometastatic disease Routine Imaging Workup susceptible treat curative radical intent ( salvage treatment ) . Routing Imaging Workup exams accept perform within 1 month PSMAPET/CT ( include WBMRI , prostatic/pelvic MRI , and/or Bone Scintigraphy ) . Patient treatment strategy base routine diagnostic workup need record discussion Urologic Tumor Board available PSMA PET/CT . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Signed inform consent prior study related procedure . Previous malignancy Prostate Cancer ( except basocellular squamous cell skin cancer ) . Patients treat palliative chemotherapy new hormonal therapy like Abiraterone/Enzalutamide . PSA rise active treatment ( LHRHagonist , LHRHantagonist , antiandrogen , maximal androgen blockade , oestrogen ) . A minimal time window 1 month require . Medical castration Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dl ( 1.7 nmol/L ) . Metastatic patient inclusion consider targeted therapy . Previous treatment isotope ( Radium , Samarium , Strontium , etc . ) All medical condition might interfere correct performance imaging scan .
