	<brief_title>MIFI Flutter Registry - Ablation Atrial Flutter With IntellaTip Sensor Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MIFI Flutter Registry non-interventional , multi-centre , prospective registry consecutive patient atrial flutter indication right atrial isthmus ablation . The registry observational study patient 's participation study impact his/her indication treatment , diagnostics therapy . Patients suppose treated accord current guideline site 's internal directive . Treatment pattern treatment initiation , continuation change solely discre-tion physician patient . There attempt influence treatment pattern individual treat physician . All drug prescription usual standard care . Participation registry way influence payment reimbursement treatment receive subject study . A minimum 10 hospital Germany treat atrial flutter use Maximum voltage-guided ( MVG ) ablation technique eligible participation . The enrolment period estimate 6 month . Eligible patient atrial flutter , visit consecutively participate site MIFI Flutter Registry . It plan enrol approximately 120 patient total . The follow-ups patient perform use standardized patient interview ( telephone call ) 6 month Institut f√ºr Herzinfarktforschung ( IHF ) . In case relevant complication , treat physician ask provide medical record verification . If patient accessible phone , local registration office contact information .</detailed_description>
