	<brief_summary>We determine incidence magnitude cerebral desaturation TBI . Adult patient ( 18 year old ) admit Surgical/Trauma Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Health Sciences Center severe TBI cerebral oximetry monitoring institute within 12 hour admission continue 72 hour placement . Decreases regional cerebral oxygenation correlate ICU hemodynamic parameter include mean arterial pressure , intracranial pressure , arterial oxygen carbon dioxide tension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patient suffer traumatic brain injury , current management strategy focus maintenance normotension normoxia normalize intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . Recent evidence call question utility ICP monitoring patient . More advanced cerebral monitoring use invasive brain tissue oxygen monitor find way widespread clinical practice . Cerebral oximetry monitoring utilizes different absorption characteristic oxygenate deoxygenated blood measure global brain oxygen level . While clinician ability reverse primary brain injury , mitigate secondary injury effect , namely hypoxia hypotension . It well known maintain normal blood pressure oxygen saturation prevent secondary brain injury . However , also know despite appearance normal hemodynamics , brain oxygen delivery ischemic penumbra may inadequate . This secondary brain injury likely related decrease cerebral oxygenation ( rSO2 ) . There number study examine link intraoperative decrease rSO2 adverse perioperative outcome . These study suggest decrease rSO2 may relate adverse neurologic non-neurologic sequela . All study suffer similar flaw , however . They typically small size , vary definition constitute cerebral desaturation event , incompletely , poorly define complication . Also lack mechanistic explanation cerebral desaturations peripheral oxygen saturation typically remain near normal . The brain consider organ high priority come tissue hypoperfusion shock state . When oxygen delivery brain decrease critical value , cerebral desaturations occur . In context TBI , cerebral desaturation may hallmark secondary injury . Consistent hypothesis , large cerebral oximetry trial date , Murkin colleague discover incidence magnitude cerebral desaturations related major non-neurologic organ morbidity . Two question arise relation prior research . First , cerebral desaturations causative adverse outcome , second desaturations treat ( i.e . cerebral oxygenation normalize ) would outcome improve ( i.e . cerebral desaturations merely epiphenomenon ) ? This study determine incidence severity cerebral desaturation traumatic brain injury patient admit Surgical Intensive Care Unit . We examine factor associate cerebral desaturation ICP blood pressure , determine decrease rSO2 helpful prognostication traumatic brain injury .</detailed_description>
