	<brief_title>Airway Management Practice Patterns Paediatric Anaesthesia : A Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Airway management one key area paediatric anaesthesia practice . The paediatric patient significant anatomical physiological difference compare adult , impact technique tool anaesthesiologist might choose provide safe effective control airway . Furthermore , number pathological process , typically see paediatric population , present unique anatomical functional difficulty airway management . The presence one syndromes condition predict `` difficult airway '' . Respiratory adverse event continue lead reason perioperative critical event child . New development airway management paediatric patient improve perioperative outcome anaesthesiologists fully acquaint fundamental aspect paediatric anaesthesia care child . This survey take within member Community European Anaesthesiologists , describe explore current pattern airway management paediatric anaesthesia . The purpose study see whether uniform practice pattern among anaesthesiologist paediatric experience without paediatric experience . Secondarily , survey also explore anaesthetist '' knowledge risk respiratory adverse event , national organization ' recommendation . Therefore , survey highlight important anatomical physiological difference implication daily anaesthesiological practice .</detailed_description>
