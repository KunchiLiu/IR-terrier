	<detailed_description>Impairing anxiety affect 33 % population adolescence become chronic , lead depression , substance abuse , school-drop even suicide . To reduce anxiety prevent sequela , patient must effectively treat early ; yet , first line intervention , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , heterogeneous response 40-60 % treated patient continue experience impairment residual symptom . The reason variability CBT outcomes remain poorly understood , individual ( include developmental ) differences brain-behavioral target CBT may contribute . This proposal address two primary question : 1 ) Do individual difference CBT-relevant brain-behavioral function lead variation CBT outcomes ? 2 ) Does development contribute variation ? To answer question , study measure change brain behavior marker anxiety , CBT , child adolescent across traditional , categorical anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social , generalized separation anxiety disorder ) . Given CBT facilitates control fear enable effective regulation , investigator hypothesize brain-behavioral marker fear sensitivity , cognitive regulatory capacity cognitive regulation fear predict characterize mechanism CBT effect . In addition , investigator hypothesize marker differentially relate CBT effect , depend patient age . Children adolescent ( 7.0 - 17.99 year ) clinically impair anxiety randomize receive CBT relaxation control therapy 12 week . Before therapy , participant receive MRI scan see region brain become active emotion concentration task perform activation change CBT . While study parallel design data-collection measurement purpose , list partial-crossover design IRB-approved protocol subject randomize relaxation therapy give option receive 12-weeks CBT session relaxation therapy data collect . Some limited data collect patient initially randomize relaxation therapy opt crossover CBT . MRI data also collect healthy youth 12 week ( without intervene therapy ) allow investigator control simple effect time may cause brain change related therapy .</detailed_description>
