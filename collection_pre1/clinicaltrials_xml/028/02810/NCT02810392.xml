Intranasally-administered insulin promise new therapy enhance memory patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , show multiple randomize controlled study . Likely mechanisms benefit intranasal insulin 's ability restore normal cerebral insulin signal . Based overlap cerebral insulin resistance occur AD post-stroke CI , design innovative proof-of-concept , feasibility trial design provide pilot data whether post-stroke survivor CI caregiver burden improve intranasal insulin early stroke . We explore impact intranasal insulin inflammatory biomarkers , since inflammation major underlie cause CI , show others preliminary study VCAM-1 . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine patient ischemic stroke randomize intranasal insulin 20 IU BID 3 week improve cognition , compare patient receive intranasal saline . Primary outcome composite ( ) memory executive function z score . 2 . To assess impact intranasal insulin v saline change inflammatory biomarker level ( VCAM-1 , TNF-alpha , TNFR-I II ) treatment period . 3 . To measure difference burden among caregiver participant intranasal insulin v intranasal saline group . We prospectively randomize 40 subject intranasal insulin ( 40 IU ) v saline treatment . Following baseline cognitive test 2 week post stroke , subject receive assign treatment 3 week , follow 3-week washout period , cognitive testing perform treatment washout period 20 week . The propose study provide data promise method treat cognitive function stroke patient . If effective , pilot data set stage large phase III clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Insulin Post-stroke Cognition : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Intranasal insulin improve post-stroke cognitive impairment administer early post-acute stroke phase compare placebo . Design : Block randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled trial 40 patient , 20 per group . Study population : Ischemic stroke patient present within 48 hour symptom onset without moderate severe aphasia homonymous hemianopia evidence cognitive impairment Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) . Recruitment : Patients identify acute hospitalization ischemic stroke , inpatient rehabilitation , post-stroke follow-up clinic . Patients hospital clinic also eligible . Eligibility assess screen MoCA target range , invite participate study . Consent : Patients sign inform consent eligible . Randomization Blinding : The participant randomize undergo full baseline cognitive battery . Caregivers also sign separate consent complete Caregiver Strain Index . Subjects randomized intranasal insulin ( 20 IU BID ) v saline BID accord stratify permuted block randomization 4 per statistician , stratify age 40 69 year vs &gt; 70 year ) presence language deficit ( base NIHSS ) time randomization . Insulin saline package identical single-dose ampule open inserted chamber VianaseTM device . Ampoules dispense 3 week supply study visit . Package label instruct participant administer dose 30-60 minute breakfast dinner . If dose miss , replace . The insulin saline identical packaging except randomization code . Patients/caregivers , investigator , outcome assessor mask group assignment . All subject receive first dose clinic wait 2 hour determine adverse effect inhale dose , remain blind treatment . The glucose level measure glucometer monitor hypoglycemia document . All subject additionally check peak dose blood sugar level glucometer , 3 time per week insulin saline treatment . The patient caregiver receive handbook describes method load device , inhalation , method fingersticks , use glucometer test strip , blood sugar log , sign symptom hypoglycemia . They also document adverse effect weekly log . Procedures : Cognitive impairment measure early stroke predict functional outcome stroke patient 13 month . Furthermore , wait 6 week stroke conduct baseline cognitive testing treatment allow enough recovery completion intensive rehabilitation patient may able complete cognitive test immediately stroke , take advantage potential benefit insulin early phase , show animal study . In addition , potentially reduce variability biomarkers avoid acute phase stroke . The frequency cognitive testing base trial intranasal insulin MCI AD . Patients history psychiatric medication use management mental emotional disorder prior stroke exclude study . However , medication may effect cognitive testing , initiation psychiatric medication avoid time study enrollment post wash period ( 9 week total ) unless clearly indicate patient 's best interest . Patients inform prohibited medication consent ask immediately inform study team new medication change exist medication . Baseline Data collection . We collect baseline data describe VCI Harmonization standard : Demographics : Birth date , sex , race/ethnicity , year current country residence , number year education , occupation , literacy , live situation level independence , type residence , marital status , name contact information family member caregiver collect . Proxy/informant information collect : Birth date , sex , race/ethnicity , relationship length time relationship patient , education , live status respect subject . Family history information collect : First-degree relative stroke , myocardial infarction , dementia , approximate age onset , age death . Stroke hospital data collect : Severity ( NIHSS ) onset , location stroke , vascular territory , modify Rankin score discharge , short physical performance battery score , length stay , stroke complication , stroke prevention medication discharge , stroke risk factor ( diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , smoking , alcohol/substance abuse , atrial fibrillation , carotid stenosis , hypercoagulable state ) , stroke subtype ( NINDS classification ) . Intranasal insulin administration : We use innovative investigational device develop Kurve Technology ( Fig 5A ) . Typical spray bottle administration result large droplet penetrate within first 20 % low nasal cavity , due gravity insufficient airflow , ~90 % droplet wind stomach ( Fig.5B ) . The ViaNaseTM device delivers substance throughout nasal cavity , olfactory region paranasal sinus , thereby maximize access nose-to-brain channel ( Fig.5C ) . This distribution occur droplet size adjust accord weight substance , individually optimized droplet generator result maximal vortical distribution ( Fig.5D ) . We use ViaNaseTM device excellent result two pilot trial ( describe ) .12,13 A total volume 2 mL insulin placebo ( saline ) administer time . Caregivers supervise participant administer intranasal treatment 2 time per day , breakfast dinner . Participants caregiver train use delivery device . In previous study , participant aMCI/AD find device easy pleasant use , compliance rate 95 97 % . Cognitive Outcome Analysis : The analysis base intention treat . The primary outcome analyze via composite z score 3 week treatment group . The summary score SIS , IADL scale SIS-16 compare baseline 3 week post treatment group . Functional covariates : Disability physical function measure collect understand trajectory motor recovery map cognitive trajectory baseline ( 2 week 20 week post-stroke ) . Exploratory analysis perform determine whether INI lead improvement IADLs , SIS-16 , mRS. Statistical Analysis : The 3 week intervention effect INI cognitive outcome assess use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust age , language deficit , baseline cognitive score . We assume Type I error rate alpha = 0.05 analysis . Adjusting baseline characteristic help attenuate potential effect differential dropout , conduct sensitivity analysis use multiple imputation ensure dropout unduly affect result . The observed estimate , standard deviation , dropout rate use design future study INI treatment stroke patient . Exploratory analysis examine response subgroup evidence enhance treatment effect , include subgroup define participant age ( &lt; 70 vs. &gt; 70 year ) , baseline cognitive impairment presence absence degree language deficit ( aphasia ) . Covariates utilized overlap clinical subgroup . Because relatively small sample size , prespecified subgroup base continuous characteristic sufficiently large , new clinically meaningful subgroup may form exploratory analysis . Power Analysis : The primary purpose pilot study demonstrate feasibility safety . The propose study collect data estimate power future trial , identify instrument sensitive propose cognitive effect , anticipate recruitment retention rate target population . However , propose study 83 % power detect 1 standard deviation difference cognitive score group 3 week ( i.e . effect size = 1.0 ) , assume normally distribute outcome , alpha = 0.05 , 10 % dropout rate .</detailed_description>
