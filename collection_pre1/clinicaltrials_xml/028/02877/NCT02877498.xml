	<brief_summary>Neuroparalytic snake envenomation result severe muscle weakness respiratory failure . Treatment require administration anti-snake venom supportive care form invasive mechanical ventilation . Whether use adaptive support ventilation ( closed loop mode ventilation ) comparison volume control ventilation shorten duration ventilation remain undetermined .

	<brief_title>A Study Compare Adaptive Support Ventilation vs. Volume Controlled Ventilation Management Respiratory Failure Patients With Neuroparalytic Snake Envenomation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Snake envenom common medical emergency encounter tropical country , estimate 35,000 -50,000 people die snakebite every year India . The bite elapid snake cause predominantly neurotoxicity , manifest ocular bulbar paralysis , paralysis muscle respiration , resultant respiratory failure . The management patient include ventilatory support administration snake anti-venom . Respiratory failure require mechanical ventilatory support frequent cause admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Mechanical ventilation life-saving intervention , improvement underlie indication , withdrawn abruptly majority . However , approximately 20-30 % patient still require gradual discontinuation ( ie , wean ) . This process difficult patient chronic respiratory disease acute neuromuscular disorder , neurotoxic snake bite , also associate important complication , nosocomial pneumonia , prolong ICU stay , even mortality , especially persistent weaning failure . Adaptive support ventilation ( ASV ) closed-loop ventilation mode design provide user-set minimum minute ventilation intubate patient , either actively breathe passively ventilate . ASV automatically select target ventilatory pattern base user input [ patient 's predict body weight ( PBW ) , minimum minute volume , pressure limit ] respiratory mechanic data ventilator monitoring system ( respiratory system expiratory time constant dynamic compliance ) . The algorithm selects ventilatory parameter minimize total work inspiration , ventilator continuously adapt match change respiratory mechanic use automatic control level inspiratory pressure positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , frequency , inspiratory time ventilator-initiated breath . In study , ASV use wean phase , patient ventilate conventional mode wean . However recent study suggest role primary ventilation initial phase respiratory failure . Previous use ASV patient acute respiratory distress syndrome describe center use ASV equally efficacious conventional mode ventilation ( volume control ) . In another study use ASV comparison pressure control ventilation patient acute respiratory failure reduce wean duration total duration mechanical ventilation . Because ASV use intubation extubation , may also offer advantage wean phase patient respiratory failure . Therefore , hypothesize ASV may shorten total mechanical ventilation ( MV ) duration , wean duration , increase weaning success rate compare conventional ventilation management patient neuroparalytic snake envenomation .</detailed_description>
