	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Due relapse nature alcoholism , excessive alcohol consumption represent significant cost US society ( $ 249 billion 2010 ) . About 64 % enter treatment relapse within one year . Development new improve treatment could personalize maximize chance maintain abstinence first year require advancement understanding behavioral neural mechanism underlie vulnerability relapse early abstinence . New intervention target underlie brain biomarkers relapse vulnerability hold significant promise reduce critical public health problem . Using rest functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify brain biomarkers support long-term abstinence brain biomarkers predict relapse . Our cross-sectional longitudinal finding provide evidence high functional connectivity ( FC ) , particularly nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) potential brain biomarker support abstinence . Resting NAcc-DLPFC FC grade depend abstinence length , high FC long-term abstinent alcoholic ( 7 year abstinence ) control intermediate FC short-term abstinent alcoholic ( 11 week abstinence ) . Further , low NAcc-DLPFC FC 11-weeks abstinence predictor subsequent relapse ( 74 % accuracy ) . Our data point specific brain biomarkers index high relapse vulnerability 11 week abstinence . Many individual , however , already relapsed time include study . It unknown whether biomarkers identify earlier recovery period . We need investigate whether biomarker relapse vulnerability identify earlier stage abstinence . Earlier identification biomarker give valuable information timely target intervention ( e.g . closer monitoring , long stay treatment program , neuromodulation ) , increase chance maintain abstinence . PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : Our long-term goal use identify brain behavioral biomarkers facilitate development new , personalized treatment support endure abstinence addiction . The overall objective study identify biomarkers relapse early abstinence ( 2-3 week abstinence ) . A secondary objective evaluate whether non-imaging measure crave executive function add value prediction model . Findings study provide insight neurobiology relapse vulnerability inform new treatment strategy need improve treatment outcome . SPECIFIC AIMS : SA 1 : To evaluate prediction accuracy FC measure individual alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) early ( 2-3 week ) abstinence . To evaluate whether non-imaging measure ( e.g . craving , executive function ) add value FC prediction model test prediction model use ( ) imaging variable ( FC task rest fMRI ) , ( ii ) non-imaging variable , ( iii ) combination image non-imaging variable predictor time relapse . Hypothesis : Based compensatory mechanism hypothesis , expect subsequent abstainer strong NAcc-DLPFC FC compare subsequent relapsers control . Pilot data suggest combination image non-imaging variable high prediction accuracy . SA 2 . To expand examination NAcc-DLPFC FC beyond rest state use Reversal Learning ( RL ) task , involve executive function reward processing . Hypothesis : Pilot data suggest subsequent abstainer show high task-related NAcc FC relapsers control . Exploratory Aim : We explore whether strength rest NAcc-DLPFC FC change perform RL task . We collect rest fMRI data RL task performance scanner . Hypothesis : Based previous finding increase task-evoked activity region , hypothesize patient show increased rest NAcc-DLPFC FC perform RL task . SIGNIFICANCE : Addiction treatment outcomes poor . Alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) U.S. remain important public health problem estimate total annual cost society $ 249.5 billion . The chronic relapsing nature AUD major obstacle successful recovery . We lack tools subtype alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . Subtyping clinical population effective approach model target intervention . For example , target treatment breast cancer patient base individual tumor estrogen receptor typing ( biomarker ) improve outcomes 25 77 % survival rate ; similar improvement outcome AUD treatment . We need identify biomarkers AUD predict relapse guide development selection treatment base subtypes increase chance achieve long-term abstinence .</detailed_description>
