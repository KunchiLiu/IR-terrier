	<brief_title>Molecular Determinants Response Preoperative Therapy Patients With Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients colorectal cancer usually receive radiation , chemotherapy , therapy surgery . At time , test help researcher find patient longer tumor leave complete treatment . Because , patient surgery completely remove rectum and/or part colon . This procedure result lifestyle change patient , may difficult permanent . Researchers look new way find patient tumor leave treatment , future , patient may able avoid surgery altogether . In study , researcher try use chemical `` marker '' tumor cell way possibly predict whether tumor likely disappear treatment alone . At MD Anderson , patient colorectal cancer endoscopy perform surgeon part standard care , start therapy . Endoscopy involve place narrow tube colon and/or rectum order see inspect tumor . If participant chooses take part study , tissue sample take tumor participant 's normal colorectal tissue standard endoscopy . Once doctor finished standard test tissue receive clinical report test , leftover tissue sample collect Dr. You person research team research test look tumor cell `` marker . '' Researchers want find marker may change since participant begin receive treatment disease . Some tissue participant 's biopsy may also send labs University Texas-Southwest testing . No identify information participant include sample . They special number assign , sample send UT Southwest able connect participant way . The result test use make decision regard treatment participant 's rectal cancer . There test procedure require study . This investigational study . Up 250 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients colorectal adenocarcinoma ( diagnosis base either MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) outside record ) 2 . Patients schedule undergo neoadjuvant therapy per MDACC care team . 3 . Patients 18 year age . 4 . Patients distant organ finding deem indeterminate metastatic enrol surgeon 's discretion . 5 . Patients deem medically safe undergo endoscopic biopsy physician performing procedure . 6 . Patients would typically undergo preoperative therapy follow surgery specific reason discretion treat physician underwent surgery without preoperative therapy may enrol surgeon ' discretion .</criteria>
