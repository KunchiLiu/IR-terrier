	<brief_summary>To confirm 1 ) whether , compare core decompression alone , core decompression porous tantalum rod implantation improve hip joint function patient avascular necrosis femoral head femoral neck fracture surgery , 2 ) whether porous tantalum rod show favorable biocompatibility human body , 3 ) whether treatment method feasible treat avascular necrosis femoral head femoral neck fracture surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Porous Tantalum Rods Improve Hip Joint Function Patients With Avascular Necrosis Femoral Head</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current status related study : Femoral neck fracture render blood supply femoral head insufficient , lead avascular necrosis femoral head . This often increase treatment difficulty strong influence recovery hip joint function . Although core decompression treatment avascular necrosis femoral head largely used clinical setting , mid-term therapeutic effect satisfactory patient . Biocompatibility define ability biomaterial , prosthesis , medical device perform appropriate host response . The biocompatibility bone implant host influence therapeutic effect . Therefore , biomaterials less likely induce negative host response may increase therapeutic effect treatment orthopedic disease . A porous tantalum rod bone trabecula-like metal implant use support weight-bearing area necrotic bone , prevent collapse necrotic area . This implant exhibit favorable effect early treatment avascular necrosis femoral head . Although previous report focus porous tantalum rod implantation clinical treatment avascular necrosis femoral head fermoral neck fracture , assess long-term therapeutic effect biocompatibility porous tantalum rod . Adverse event Possible adverse event include expect unexpected symptom . If severe adverse event occur , information include date occurrence measure take related treatment adverse event report principal investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis , open access Data collection : Case report form demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , drug allergy history , adverse event collect , process use Epidata software , collate , electrically record use double-data entry strategy data manager . Data management : The locked electronic database alter way , available project manager . Paper electronic data regard screening , informed consent , clinical outcome preserve Affiliated Hospital Nantong University , China . Data analysis : The electronic database make available professional statistician statistical analysis . An outcome analysis report make statistician submit lead researcher . An independent data monitoring committee supervise manage trial data goal ensure scientific stringent trial process , result accurate complete data . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish http : //www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician use SPSS 19.0 software follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , standard deviation , min , max . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median , upper quartile ( q3 ) . McNemar 's test use compare percentage patient excellent hip joint function per Harris hip score 12 month surgery , percentage patient present femoral head collapse , prosthesis loosening , peri-prosthesis infection , incidence complication 6 12 month surgery . The Mann-Whitney U test use compare VAS score prior 1 , 6 , 12 month surgery . Statistical significance accept Î± = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
