	<brief_title>MYPLAN - Effectiveness Safety Plan App Manage Crisis Persons Risk Suicide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MYPLAN -mobile phone application manage crisis person risk suicide : multi-center , superiority randomize clinical trial . Andreasson K , Krogh J , Frandsen H , Buus N , Bech . P Nordentoft M , Erlangsen A Background In Denmark , 8-10,000 people attempt suicide yearly basis1 . Suicide ideation part continuum , initial suicidal ideation might develop concrete plan action , depend suicidal intent suicidal action might end suicide attempt complete suicide2 . Therefore , order prevent suicidal behavior suicide , important avoid reduce suicide ideation ; i.e . secure good control painful thought suicidal behavior . This do safety plan . The safety plan develop cognitive therapeutic intervention apply empirically early study 345 . The safety plan consider part cognitive behavior therapeutic intervention , reduce suicidal risk consist basic component , 1 ) recognize warn sign upcoming suicidal crisis , 2 ) work internal coping strategy , 3 ) distraction suicidal thought , use social contact social settings6 . This do removing ass lethal mean , self-monitoring trigger `` suicidal mode '' 7 . To prevent suicidal behavior , The National Board Health establish Suicide Prevention Clinics nationwide Denmark . The clinic offer highly specialize short-term supportive psychotherapy social counsel suicidal patient outpatient set . The target group subsample person severe suicide ideation suicide attempt clinic focus person risk suicide severe underlie psychiatric disorder require psychiatric admission specialize treatment8 . Some clinic specialize child adolescent offer support patient young 10 year age . The safety plan integral part treatment patient work first session . Hypothesis The hypothesis trial app-based safety plan effective paper version safety plan reduce suicide ideation suicidal patient . Purpose The purpose trial investigate safety plan deliver app compare safety plan deliver paper , reduce suicide ideation 12 month intervention patient refer Suicide Prevention Clinics . Methods/design The trial design 2-arm , multi-site , parallel group , observer-blinded randomized clinical superiority trial . Based power calculation , total 546 participant , 273 arm include , recruit national suicide preventive clinic . Both group receive treatment usual consist short term psychotherapy social counselling : 1 ) Experimental intervention safety plan provide app MYPLAN , 2 ) Treatment Usual ( TAU ) : safety plan original paper format . Recruitment criterion inclusion exclusion All participant recruit Suicide Prevention Clinics Denmark . The patient refer somatic psychiatric ward suicide attempt , general practitioner , also refer suicide preventive clinic . There age restriction participation study . Enrollment randomization At first visit Suicide Prevention Clinic , eligible participant receive oral information study well information pamphlet . They offer time reflection possibility renew appointment clinic together relative , answer . If patient fulfils inclusion criteria none exclusion criterion , patient randomize use computer-generated sequence randomization either 1 ) Treatment usual plus app : treatment usual plus safety plan app , 2 ) treatment usual pu safety plan paper . The randomization stratify gender previous self-harm ( yes/no ) , facilitate external , centrally administer internet service . The clinician work Suicide Prevention Clinics , access internet obtain information patient allocation ( safety plan either app paper version ) , immediately patient provide informed consent . This procedure ensure adequate allocation concealment . Blinding Due nature intervention , blind participant clinician possible , outcome assessment analysis carry blind treatment allocation . All data collect questionnaire ( SurveyXact ) secure encrypt server . The analysis perform blinded scientist . Interventions Treatment Usual ( TAU ) : Participants allocate treatment usual receive 8-10 session supportive psychotherapy part standard care suicide preventive clinic . Each clinic apply different combined therapy include cognitive , problem-solving , crisis , dialectical behavior , integrate care , psychodynamic , systemic , psychoanalytic approach , and/or social counselling . A uniform treatment algorithm follow ; element choose basis deem promising strategy individual case . As integral part therapy clinical fill safety plan patient review sign situation crisis occur previously work strategy distraction well help-seeking . The safety plan present patient use comparable manual-based instruction . Participants randomized paper format write safety plan sheet paper bring home original clinical keep copy together medical record patient . Experimental intervention : Participants allocate experimental intervention receive treatment usual , introduction app-based safety plan MYPLAN . Using instruction manual , clinician review previous crisis situation possible strategy . See figure 1 . CONSORT flow diagram Outcomes Primary outcome measure difference suicide ideation enter trial 12 month participation trial . This measured Becks suicide ideation scale ( BSS 21-items ) . The outcome consider proxy measure suicide attempt complete suicide . Secondary outcome : hopelessness ( Becks Hopelessness Scale , BHS ) , depressive symptom ( Major depression Inventory , MDI ) . Exploratory outcome We choose exploratory outcome , quality life measure WHO Well-being Index , ( WHO-5 ) , user satisfaction measure modify User satisfaction Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( CSQ-8 ) , self-harm ( self-reported ) , mortality , admission psychiatric somatic emergency ward , somatic psychiatric hospital register data . Patient report outcomes measure ( PROM ) These collect baseline follow-up self-administered tablet-/ internet-based questionnaire . Follow-ups conduct 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month date inclusion . Participants receive e-mail link online survey . Respondents log secure data portal , SurveyXact , personal trial id-number answer questionnaire collect . The register-based outcome mortality , suicide attempt , somatic usage somatic mental health care service assess 12 24 month obtain data extract list registry . Statistical analysis The primary outcome mean change Becks Suicide Ideation scale 6 month . We expect participant intervention group 6 month score 2.5 point low compare participant TAU group . Based previous publication expect post-intervention SD 9 . Setting alpha level 5 percent beta level 10 percent need include 273 participant group total 546 participant . Analysis primary outcome conduct accord intention-to-treat principle : participant include final analysis accord group assignment regardless adherence treatment . This study multiple assessment point primary analysis use repeat measurement mixed model unstructured variance . This procedure able handle baseline difference miss data . For participant miss data two data point identify potential difference participant full data use include variable potential confounders secondary analysis . All statistical analysis conduct SPSS . All test two-tailed p value 0.5 consider significant interpreted respect hierarchy hypothesis . Pilot study/feasibility test Prior study pilot study carry one site . The aim make pilot study similar trial possible . A total 40 participant recruit , 20 arm . The randomization technical practical procedure test . Clinicians present safety plan describe use manual-based instruction . The participant follow 3 month . Data scale list outcomes collect ; time enrollment tablet end follow-up email . Ethical consideration The trial approve Regional Ethics Committee Capital Region Denmark Danish Data Protection agency . The trial register Clinicaltrials.gov NCT . In accordance Consort guideline , publish positive , neutral negative finding trial . The patient inform trial verbally write information sign write consent .
