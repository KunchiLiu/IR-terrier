The last 6 month reserve data analysis , study closeout , manuscript preparation . An intervening 2-year period divide 4 six-month calendar time period carry protocol data collection . For 6-month period , ED randomize treatment assignment pediatric emergency critical care consultation ( `` M '' telemedicine `` P '' telephone . ) Participating EDs ( unit randomization ) stratify two stratum size ED geographical location . EDs randomize within-strata one four unbalanced ( 3:1 ) crossover treatment assignment sequence , consist 6-month period : PMMM , MPMM , MMPM , MMMP . During assigned period , type consultation assign strongly encourage , deviate protocol ( i.e. , use telephone consultation randomize telemedicine , vice-versa ) allow need physician .
