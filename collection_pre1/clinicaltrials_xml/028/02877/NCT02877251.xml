	<brief_title>Mexican Multidisciplinary Registry Patients With Venous Thromboembolic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Venous thromboembolism disease , ( VTE ) comprise deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . In United States , incidence remain relatively constant . In Mexico , annual incidence unknown . In spite technological risk stratification advance , still third cause cardiovascular pulmonary disease . Presentation PE quite heterogeneous . As complex disease highly variable presentation different clinical setting , DVT-PE confront managed cardiologist , pneumologists , intensive care , internal medicine , emergency , orthopedics surgery physician . Thus , initial clinical approach result vary depend attend physician , experience hospital infrastructure . The mainstay VTE treatment anticoagulation , either systemic oral . PE management , however , varies widely , depend patient presentation substantially hemodynamic consequence base right ventricle ( RV ) dysfunction . A careful clinical history physical examination , integrate electrocardiographic , laboratory appropriate imaging finding could help risk stratification order proceed treatment . Though patient present clear hemodynamic compromise , others may incidentally diagnosis test perform different reason . Scoring system identify patient different level risk . Registries may help get key finding quantify clinical characteristic , electrocardiographic , laboratory modality image well treatment trend clinical outcome real world . Results REMMITE , retrospective prospective registry one-year follow-up , provide valuable insight clinical diagnosis , management , treatment trend well related outcome . The REMMITE potential dictate guideline recommendation base identified deficit good practice among participate center . REMMITE design Primary objective : identify clinical characteristic , treatment trend , in-hospital 12 month follow-up outcome major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) patient diagnose either DVT , DVT-PE , PE . Variables include In patient : ) demographic data , b ) date onset symptom , c ) past medical history , ) physical examination e ) electrocardiographic , f ) laboratory g ) imaging finding , h ) treatment acute phase , ) in-hospital follow - outcome , j ) treatment follow-up , k ) MACE . Retrospective case enrollment Patients history DVT , DVT-PE , PE last year enrol . In patient : ) demographic data , b ) date onset symptom , c ) past medical history , ) physical examination e ) electrocardiographic , f ) laboratory g ) imaging finding , h ) treatment acute phase , ) in-hospital follow - outcome , j ) treatment follow-up , patient oral anticoagulation vitamin K antagonists International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) record ; k ) percentage patient non-vitamin K antagonist ( NOAC´s ) follow ) l ) MACE . Prospective case enrollment Patients acute episode DVT , DVT-PE , PE enrol . In patient : ) demographic data , b ) date onset symptom , c ) past medical history , ) physical examination e ) electrocardiographic , f ) laboratory g ) imaging finding , h ) treatment acute phase , ) in-hospital follow - outcome , j ) treatment follow-up , ( patient oral anticoagulation vitamin K antagonists INR record ; ) k ) patient receive ( NOAC´s ) drug discharge , l ) percentage patient NOAC´s follow , ) MACE . Sites Centers investigator expertise diagnosis , stratification treatment patient DVT , DVT-PE , PE involve . Also , Centers without expertise , facility diagnosis treatment real interest enrolling include , long accomplish protocol requirement . Quality Criteria Following criterion use guarantee quality data : ) electronic , simple accessible data collection , back-upped clinical file , b ) participate assay fill familiar electronic data collection , c ) standardize definition , data report ; ) meeting among principal investigator steer committee least year ; e ) ethic procedure review ; f ) rigorous center selection base investigator expertise and/or facility resource ) ; g ) consecutive patient enrollment obtain representative sample ; h ) random center audit ; ) centralize data statistical analysis ; j ) report data consistent conclusion ; k ) transparency fund publication . Also , way qualify quality registry measure number publication presentation national international meeting . Data collection Electronic database specific variable : date onset symptom , medical history , personal history , physical examination , electrocardiographic , chest x-Ray , echocardiogram , V/Q lung scan , magnetic resonance imaging , chest compute tomography , pulmonary angiography , right heart catheterization , venous ultrasound , biomarkers , treatment either pharmacologic percutaneous , MACE .</detailed_description>
