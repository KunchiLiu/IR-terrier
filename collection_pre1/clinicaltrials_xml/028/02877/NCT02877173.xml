	<brief_title>A Safety/Efficacy Study Alprostadil Liposomes Injection Treat Lower Extremity Arteriosclerosis Obliterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 dose-finding study evaluate initially efficacy safety alprostadil liposomes injection treatment atherosclerotic occlusive disease low extremity different dose strengths.The total duration subject participation approximately 5 week , consist 2-week run-in period,3-week treatment safety follow-up period . Subjects sign inform consent form ( ICF ) screen visit assign subject identifier.Subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criterion successfully complete protocol procedure screen enter 2-week run-in.Following 2-week run-in period , eligible subject randomize ( 1:1:1:1 ) one follow double-blind treatment group : Group A : Alprostadil Liposomes Injection low dose:20ug , day ( QD ) ; Group B : Alprostadil Liposomes Injection medium dose:40ug , QD Group C : Alprostadil Liposomes Injection high dose:60ug , QD Group D ( Positive Control Group ) : Alprostadil Injection:10ug , QD All treatment deliver intravenously guttae.A subject consider complete study complete phase study include run-in , randomization , randomize treatment efficacy safety follow-up phase .</detailed_description>
