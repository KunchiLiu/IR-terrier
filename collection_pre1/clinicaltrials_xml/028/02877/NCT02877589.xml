	<brief_summary>Immunosuppression induce cancer treatment increase risk hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) reactivations . These viral reactivations may asymptomatic cause fulminant hepatitis death . More , impact treatment cancer chemotherapy delay stop . They occur cancer treatment also stop , immunological rebound . This risk persist least 6 month cessation . The key prevention , first step , serological testing . It also main problem international recommendation diverge . Hepatologists infectious disease specialist recommend routine screening HBV candidate immunosuppressive therapy . These recommendation implement hematologist , give frequency HBV reactivation associate haematological malignancy . Clinical oncology society guideline suggest selective screening case risk factor hepatitis B patient strong immunosuppression ( anti-CD20 base treatment , stem cell transplantation lymphoma treatment ) . The consequence difference sub-screening oncologist persistence fatal case . Screening cytotoxic chemotherapy solid tumor country low prevalence HBV HCV virus questionable . Selective screening patient risk HBV HCV assess .</brief_summary>
