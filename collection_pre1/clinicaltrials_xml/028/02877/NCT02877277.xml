	<brief_title>Epigenetics , Vitamin C Abnormal Hematopoiesis - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , document hematological cancer patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) exhibit severe vitamin C deficiency . Vitamin C essential co-factor ten-eleven translocation ( TET ) enzymes , initiate DNA demethylation oxidation 5-methylcytosine ( mC ) 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine ( hmC ) . In-vitro study show vitamin C physiological dos add DNA methyltransferase inhibitor ( DNMTis ) , induce synergistic inhibition cell proliferation enhance apoptosis . These effect mediate via viral mimicry response recently associate cancer stem-like cell death enhance immune signal include increased expression bi-directionally transcribe endogenous retrovirus ( ERV ) transcript , increase presence cytosolic double strand RNAs , activation interferon induce cellular response transcript . Data suggest correction vitamin C deficiency may improve response epigenetic therapy DNMTis . In EVITA pilot study , investigator include MDS/AML patient explore potential role restore vitamin C within normal physiological range treatment hematological cancer DNMTis .</detailed_description>
