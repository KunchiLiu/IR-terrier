	<detailed_description>Follicular lymphoma indolent yet incurable lymphoma characterize relapsing-remitting course initial response standard therapy , invariably follow short disease free interval . In recent year , significant treatment improvement achieve , mainly due introduction anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab standard therapy . Unfortunately , patient invariably relapse require additional treatment . Therefore new therapy need order improve treatment outcomes . Recent advance preclinical research improve knowledge molecular biology lymphoma permit development high number new therapeutic compound inhibit component alter signal pathway drive genesis lymphoma progression . Additionally , improvement monoclonal antibody technology permit development new active monoclonal antibody recognize different antigen surface lymphoma cell . Obinutuzumab , type II , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody clinically test single agent well combination chemotherapy target agent , show significant clinical activity CLL FL patient refractory rituximab . Additionally venetoclax , small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor recently advance clinical trial , show good safety profile sign single agent activity CLL B-cell lymphoma , include patient relapsed/refractory FL . There interest investigate venetoclax FL , give pathogenesis lymphoma relies chromosomal translocation ( 14 ; 18 ) ( q32 ; q21 ) , present nearly case result constitutive overexpression BCL2 gene , allow B cell abrogate default germinal center apoptotic program . The combination two compound interest give single agent activity observe FL . Preclinical study demonstrate synergism vitro well vivo model different lymphomas two compound currently investigate combination study CLL chemotherapy CHOP regimen non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Based single agent activity two compound aim develop new chemotherapy-free combination regimen , SAKK trial plan evaluate combination obinutuzumab venetoclax previously untreated FL patient need systemic therapy . There data venetoclax combination rituximab bendamustine relapse refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) patient . No significant safety signal observe . In indication CLL combination obinutuzumab venetoclax currently investigate phase I dose find trial ( NCT01685892 ) . Nevertheless , best knowledge , propose trial one first trial worldwide investigate combination treatment obinutuzumab venetoclax FL first line treatment . Given need improve chemotherapy-free approach first-line treatment patient FL need systemic therapy , combination may provide opportunity active well tolerate regimen present short long term toxicity chemotherapy . This phase I study provide information safety tolerability together evidence preliminary antitumor activity obinutuzumab combination venetoclax first line treatment FL .</detailed_description>
