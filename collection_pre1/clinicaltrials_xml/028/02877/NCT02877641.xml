	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish effect D vitamin ( vitamin D3 ) supplementation inspiratory muscle strength vitamin D3-deficient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient . ( Roswell Park Cancer Institute [ RPCI ] /University Buffalo [ UB ] study ) II . To establish 12 month conversion rate . ( University Pittsburgh Cancer Institute [ UPCI ] study ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish effect vitamin D3 supplementation peripheral muscle strength exercise capacity vitamin D3-deficient COPD patient . ( RPCI/UB study ) II . To establish 3 6-month conversion rate . ( UPCI study ) III . To examine whether vitamin D3 supplementation equally effective COPD patient current versus former smoker . ( UPCI study ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore effect vitamin D3 supplementation COPD patient biomarkers lung cancer risk , inflammation , pulmonary function . ( UPCI study ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . CONTROL ARM : Patients receive placebo multivitamin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 52 week . SUPPLEMENTATION ARM : Patients receive multivitamin cholecalciferol supplement PO QD 52 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
