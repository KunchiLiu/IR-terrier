	<brief_summary>Increased intestinal permeability one main pathophysiological mechanism involve irritable bowel syndrome . The expression intestinal tight junction protein decrease mostly IBS-diarrhoea patient . This decrease correlate increased intestinal permeability . Currently , test use clinical practice could assess intestinal permeability . We hypothesis plasmatic zonulin could reflect intestinal permeability IBS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is There Any Correlation Between Plasmatic Zonulin Expression Intestinal Tight Junction Proteins IBS Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study look correlation plasmatic zonulin increase colonic permeability ( assessed expression intestinal tight junction proteins western blot ) IBS patient look role intestinal low-grade inflammation microbiota . Population : IBS patient diarrhoea IBS constipation mix worsen symptom Outcomes measure : Plasmatic zonulin ( ELISA kit ) Occludin expression colonic biopsy ( western blot )</detailed_description>
