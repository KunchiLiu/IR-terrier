	<brief_summary>Chronic heart failure common disease . It also serious disease mortality 50 % 5 year , represent significant cost term public health expenditure . Heart transplantation represent `` gold standard '' care terminal heart failure patient reach end disease despite optimal medical surgical management disease , survival rate transplant patient 90 % 1 year 82 % 3 year . Long term LVAD innovative technology available decade , develop part shortage cardiac graft high mortality among patient wait transplant due important pending . This technique use substantially ten fifteen year world . Survival implantation late device reach 80 % 1 year . In France , technique intend patient terminal heart failure end different pharmacological invasive therapeutic resource available . Currently , academic center offer possibility long-term LVAD support organize unicentric order centralize specialized care patient . Indeed , patient candidate establishment long-term LVAD rigorously select ensure acceptable survival . However , practice vary considerably one center another particular regarding : - Implantation indication , - Pre-implantation patient assessment , - Monitoring , - Implementation pharmacological treatment , particularly anticoagulants betablockers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : It 's prospective multicentric observational study realise 3 University Hospital France : Bordeaux , Montpellier Toulouse . Population : All patient undergoing implantation long-term LVAD support whatever brand type , one 3 participating center ( Montpellier , Toulouse Bordeaux ) 3 year period , approval informed consent . Patients follow 1 6 month , 1 year part routine management disease . Patients agree participate observatory , know participation refusal participate alter therapeutic attitude team responsible patient . Aim : Main aim 1 year mortality LVAD recipient Secondary aim : - Descriptive epidemiology LVAD implantation : prevalence , etiology , affect population - Description state practice : indication , against-indications , preimplantation data , intraoperative data , postoperative data , track data - Rating prognosis patient LVAD support - In-hospital , 30 day , 6 month , 1 year survival - Number transplant assisted patient 1 year - Evaluation complication ( infection , bleeding , thromboembolism , equipment failure , ... ) - Analyses subgroup accord age , sex , initial indication ( include ischemic heart disease v nonischemic ) , assistance use year implantation - Research prognostic factor postoperative chronic right ventricular failure , prognostic factor cardiovascular cause death . Feasibility : Based historical data concern center ( CHU Montpellier , Bordeaux Toulouse ) recent prediction french health authority HAS ( `` Haute Autorité de Santé '' ) , 200 patient provide observatory register , rhythm 20-30 patient per year per center 3-year recruitment period Monitoring carry refer physician patient 1 6 month , 1 year usual care pathology center possibility adapt follow-up date +/- 1 month . For patient move therefore change referral center , evaluation one year make mail phone contact physician / patient . Collect circulation patient ' data : Data collect patient 's refer physician 's responsibility center . Data enter directly electronic database ( e-CRF ) develop University Montpellier . Patient identify number center ( 1 = Bordeaux , 2 = Montpellier 3 = Toulouse ) follow first letter name first initial center patient number question ( automatic chronological number accord entry e-CRF - data cod integrated e-CRF ) Monitoring 1 month , 6 month 1 year , complete middle refer physician enter directly electronic database . There traffic data paper two step . In case lose sight , follow-up 1 year carry center , phone mail municipality birth , attend physician cardiologist patient , require knowledge date full birth patient avoid confusion . For analysis , data anonymized ( show ) . Members scientific committee , person responsible logistics coordination statistic access identify data . Research data enter via electronic case report form ( e-CRF ) develop Capture System software ( CLINSIGHT company ) , enable quality control data real time . To meet regulatory requirement , software complies FDA 's recommendation Computerized Systems Managing Clinical Trials electronic signature standard ( CDISC , ICH , GCP 2001/20 / EC ... ) . The connection via password unique identifier specific user give access patient . An audit function integrate allow traceability data well change . The encrypted data transmit responsible center data-management via secure internet connection . The e-CRF must compose information require protocol . Information Consent participant : Prior completion research , free , write informed consent patient must collect information investigator consultation , sufficient period reflection . Participants information research write simply , language understandable patient . After read participant investigator date signed consent form ( original archive investigator original give research participant ) .</detailed_description>
