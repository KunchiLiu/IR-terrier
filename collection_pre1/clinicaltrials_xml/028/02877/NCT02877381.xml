	<brief_summary>To determine optimal dose regimen route administration tranexamic acid ( TXA ) [ single dose intravenous ( IV ) , double dose intravenous , intravenous + topical , oral repeat dose ] minimize post-operative blood loss transfusion requirement follow revision total knee arthroplasty ( RTKA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid Revision Total Joint Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective randomize control study Scientific Background/Intro : Total hip knee arthroplasty associate risk moderate significant blood loss . Approximately one-third patient undergoing total joint replacement surgery require one three unit blood postoperatively . Tranexamic acid synthetic antifibrinolytic agent successfully use orally , intravenously , topically control bleed total joint replacement . The use TXA show significantly reduce need blood product total joint replacement.1-3 Many study explore use various TXA regimens follow primary TKA . Tanaka et al . demonstrate pre-operative administration TXA superior intra-operative administration double dose regimen superior single dose regimen.4 Maniar et al . support idea pre-operative TXA administration superior , addition high dos TXA improve efficacy without increase thromboembolic complications.5 More recently , Lin et al . demonstrate combine pre-operative IV dose TXA intra-articular dose arthrotomy closure superior intra-articular dose alone.6 Also , unpublished randomize control trial recently complete , find oral TXA provide equivalent blood control low cost IV TXA . It well know revision joint arthroplasty case complex primary joint replacement . Revision total knee arthroplasty associate great risk blood loss increase transfusion rate compare primary TKA.7 Despite vast body literature investigate TXA follow primary TKA , three retrospective study publish use TXA revision TKA.8-10 All three study show IV TXA decrease rate transfusion amount blood transfuse compare controls.8-10 Although TXA formulation use primary TKA show effective retrospective study , amount blood loss risk transfusion still remain significantly high primary TKA . By perform first randomize control trial use TXA follow revision TKA , believe help change practice pattern provide evidence TXA formulation use primary TKA inadequate revision TKA . Additionally , explore new combination TXA administration answer question bring previous study regard optimal TXA regimen .</detailed_description>
