	<brief_title>Evaluation Effects Mixture Amino Acids ( Amixea ) Lean Body Mass Muscle Strengh Patients With Unresectable Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most cancer patient experience weight loss time disease progress . The result malnutrition increase risk treatment complication may lead poor treatment response and/or tolerance , reduce quality life poor survival . The prevalence malnutrition cancer patient think high 80 % , report vary cancer location stage , treatment history , clinical setting assessment criterion . Weight loss cachexia common present sign NSCLC , represent great concern many patient family . At regard , NSCLC cachexia worth particular investigation prevalence disease , frequency associate weight loss prognostic implication weight loss patient . Weight stabilization may optimistic outcome expect patient cachexia still beneficial , weight-losing patient cancer cachexia stabilize weight great quality life survival continue lose weight . It , fact , well-known cachexia increase cancer-related mortality devastate effect quality life.Randomized control trial data indicate early palliative care improve quality life depressive symptom may extend survival advanced NSCLC compare standard care . In particular , observed conventional nutritional supplement partly successful induce protein accretion advance cancer , suggest attenuate anabolic response . To prevent muscle waste deleterious consequence , generate anabolic response crucial . Dietary essential amino acid ( EAA ) anabolic property waste disease , however data advance cancer lacking . Previous study analyze patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cachexia skeletal muscle dysfunction demonstrate quadriceps weakness one-third COPD patient attend hospital respiratory outpatient service . An accurate rapid evaluation muscle strength may identify patient muscle weakness could crucial importance prompt specific intervention prescribe adequate support therapy . Starting assumption , main objective study evaluate effect amino acid mixture ( Amixea ) body composition dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , bone mineral densitometer , quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction force ( QMVC ) advance NSCLC patient , compare placebo , 10 week treatment .</detailed_description>
