	<brief_summary>The treatment advance gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) shift since arrival target therapy . Imatinib active multikinase inhibitor mainly target C-kit tyrosine-kinase receptor platelet-derived growth factor receptor . Imatinib use validate adjuvant palliative therapy setting . Imatinib generally well-tolerated know improve performance status 16 % grade 3-4 toxicity , lead least 40 % withdrawal , report . Recently , oncology , sarcopenia show predictor severe toxicity patient include phase 1 trial , suggest consider inclusion criterion study . Sarcopenic patient low performance status , short survival , chemotherapy toxicity post-operative infection , long post-operative hospitalization time . In addition , exposure tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( e.g . sorafenib sunitinib ) associate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) patient renal cell hepatocellular carcinoma . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan acquire routine care validate accurate robust imaging technique evaluate sarcopenia cancer patient .</brief_summary>
