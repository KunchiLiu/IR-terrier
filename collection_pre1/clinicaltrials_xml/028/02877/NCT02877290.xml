	<brief_summary>In study , 20 hypercapnic COPD patient perform two constant workrate endurance cycle test . One test use non-invasive Ventilation ( NIV ) support , one without randomize cross-over design . The aim measure , whether NIV able change peripheral respiratory muscle oxygenation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Non-invasive Ventilation Oxygenation Peripheral Muscle Hypercapnic COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study patient perform one incremental work rate test obtain peak work rate . On follow day two constant work rate cycle endurance test ( CWRT ) perform 60 % Peak work rate use randomise cross-over design . Between two CWRTs one hour recovery time . One CWRTs perform support non-invasive Ventilation ( NIV ) , one without . Respiratory cardiovascular parameter observe transcutaneous measurement CO2 ( Sentec device ) near-infrared spectroscopy device . The purpose study , examine whether use NIV decrease patient dyspnoea , also positive effect patient cardiovascular System , exercise capacity muscle oxygenation . The investigator examine tissue oxygen saturation 7th intercostal space ( reflect respiratory muscle ) M. vastus lateralis leg CWRTs . With Support NIV , expect see change oxygenation towards good perfusion leg muscle , due facilitation work breathing . This may result later onset leg fatigue increase exercise capacity patient . To equivalent workload parameter compare isotime . To conclude , aim study record interplay Oxygenation Perfusion Intercostal muscle peripheral leg muscle exercise . The investigator hypothesize , use NIV may change oxygenation favour leg muscle relieve respiratory muscle .</detailed_description>
