	<detailed_description>This study employ randomize controlled two-arm design . All test train take place St. Michael 's Hospital ( 30 Bond Street , Toronto , Ontario ) . During study participant perform simulate low endoscopic procedure virtual reality ( VR ) endoscopy simulator . Description Simulation Devices use Low-Fidelity Simulator ( Bench Top Model ) : The low-fidelity simulator validate bench-top endoscopy simulator help develop general endoscopic skill . The simulator comprise series vertical wooden barrier number target ( hole ) conform 27 different sequence vary complexity . An Olympus paediatric videocolonoscope use navigate define sequence quickly accurately possible , visual output display video monitor . High-Fidelity Simulator : Virtual Reality Model : The high-fidelity simulator use test train EndoVRÂ® virtual reality ( VR ) endoscopy simulator . It model navigation colon , use specialize endoscope insert computer-based module screen show colonic lumen virtual patient . It provide visual haptic feedback related procedure . The VR simulator number standardize case-based scenario vary complexity colonoscopy . Details experimental design Baseline questionnaire : A write questionnaire administer participant start project collect demographic background information include : age , sex , level training , previous endoscopy experience nature experience ( applicable ) , video game experience , may correlate baseline endoscopic skill . Pre-test : All participant take part pre-test design assess baseline ( 1 ) knowledge colonoscopy ; ( 2 ) technical skill ; ( 3 ) non-technical skill . No feedback provide point pre-test . The pre-test consist follow : Knowledge Test : A 30 minute ( 20 question ) multiple-choice question test design ass participant ' theoretical knowledge colonoscopy , include indication , sedation , safety , finding , pathology follow-up . VR Simulation Test : Participants baseline endoscopic technical proficiency assess completion colonoscopy procedure VR simulator . This scenario simulate screen colonoscopy , without need type intervention biopsy . The procedure time participant take long 30 minute complete procedure . An expert rater present assess performance , provide assistance . All participant videotape order obtain performance measure face captured ensure anonymity . Prior start procedure , participant complete questionnaire measure self-efficacy . VR Simulation Based `` Integrated Scenario '' Test : Following simulator-only test , participant complete Integrated Scenario format test ass baseline endoscopic non-technical proficiency . This test model another test participant perform colonoscopy procedure VR simulator interact endoscopic nurse standardize patient ( SP ) portray patient . The simulated procedure mimic setup endoscopic suite , VR simulator position next patient bed . A standardized patient , receive instruction regard medical role , act scenario colon cancer screen . Trainees expect explain colonoscopy procedure , benefit risk , obtain procedural consent . The trainee carry procedure VR simulator respond patient interact standardized nurse ( SN ) appropriate . The SP act cue VR simulator simulator signal procedure exceed threshold discomfort . The performance participant videotape ( manner face captured ensure anonymity ) order obtain performance measure . Participants give maximum 45 minute complete procedure . Prior start procedure , participant complete questionnaire measure self-efficacy . Training intervention : Subsequently participant randomize , use online randomization algorithm , one two group ( follow 1:1 allocation distribution ) Sample size calculation : A power analysis compute use G*Power version 3.1.9 . Using previous study evaluate NTS train curriculum surgery assess Non-Technical Skills Surgeons ( NOTSS ) OSANTS form , conduct analysis use relevant effect size . Based effect size 0.65 ( effect size f ) , alpha 0.05 ( two-tailed ) , beta 0.20 , 2 group , 3 measurement , 16 participant require achieve power great 0.80 use repeat measure ANOVA ( between-factors ) . Furthermore , previous study compare curriculum endoscopic simulation find minimum 15 participant per group sufficient detect significant difference . To accommodate project 20 % dropout and/or non-response may occur , therefore plan recruit total 36 participant . Statistical analysis : Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 20 . All statistical test consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Baseline Questionnaire : Patient demographic baseline variable compare two group use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) chi-square test continuous categorical variable respectively . ( b ) Clinical Performance ( Technical Non-Technical ) : Clinical performance live colonoscopy group determine compare score DOPS , GiECAT , NAPCOMS , Modified-OSANTS . Specifically , mixed factor 2 ( NTS curriculum vs. TS curriculum ) x 2 ( procedure 1 vs. procedure 2 ) ANOVA use determine whether difference base rating scale . Tukey 's honest significant difference ( HSD ) test use post-hoc analysis determine significant difference . Technical Performance : Technical performance simulator group determine compare score DOPS , GiECAT , GAGES . Specifically , mixed factor 2 ( NTS curriculum vs. TS curriculum ) x 3 ( pretest , posttest , retention test ) ANOVA use determine whether difference base rating scale . Tukey HSD test use post-hoc analysis determine significant difference . Non-Technical Performance : Non-technical performance simulator group determine compare score GiECAT modify OSANTS . Specifically , mixed factor 2 ( NTS curriculum vs. TS curriculum ) x 3 ( pretest , posttest , retention test ) ANOVA use determine whether difference base rating scale . Tukey HSD test use post-hoc analysis determine significant difference .</detailed_description>
