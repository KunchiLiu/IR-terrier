	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Furosemide Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center , open-label , pilot study conduct 2 phase . Each phase enroll 20 subject use inform study design SUBQ-HF Study ( approximately 300 evaluable patient randomize either usual inpatient care early discharge home subcutaneous furosemide 2-7 day ) . Inpatient Pilot Phase : Eligible in-patients approach participation . Subjects consent participation treat subcutaneous furosemide 48 hour , remain hospital . This primarily safety feasibility assessment . There formal hypothesis test , statistical analysis descriptive nature . Outpatient Pilot Phase : Eligible in-patients near discharge approach participation . Subjects consent participation instruct use device , discharge home treat home subcutaneous furosemide 2-7 day . This primarily safety feasibility assessment . There formal hypothesis test , statistical analysis descriptive nature .</detailed_description>
