	<brief_title>Effect Long Acting Anticholinergic Nocturnal Incontinence After Radical Cystectomy Orthotopic Neobladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Radical cystectomy ( RC ) urinary diversion remain gold standard treatment muscle invasive bladder cancer.1 The optimal goal control malignancy , preserve renal function optimize health relate quality life . Decision urinary diversion selection change last three decade non-continent diversion orthotopic neobladder ( ONB ) , maintain void pattern closely similar normal pattern improve overall health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) .2 However , continence status ONB affect many factor , patient 's age , mental status , intact innervated external urethral sphincter , reservoir capacity pressure , presence infection completeness voiding.3 The recovery continence status take six 12 month operation achieve day time continence regain earlier nocturnal continence take 12 24 months.3 The report day time continence range 85 90 % NI series range 20 40 % .4- 7 woman , report incidence day time NI range 68 100 % 26 89 % , respectively.8- 11 Nocturnal incontinence major problem affect HRQOL . In multicenter study , individual ONB NI low HRQOL , 12 similar data female patient ONB.2 Nocturnal incontinence may due patient pouch cause . Loss afferent input Detrusor muscle central nervous system think account worsen nocturnal continence.13 In study , do El Bahnasawy et al , evaluate factor affect NI RC ONB ; high pressure , positive urine culture , large post void residual volume , decrease maximal urethral pressure , decrease flow rate patient compliance associate high incidence NI . However , multivariate analysis , post void residual volume , frequency , maximal amplitude uninhibited contraction remain significantly associate NI.14 Fifty percent woman NI RC ONB pouch hyperactivity urodynamic evaluation.15 To optimize nocturnal continence , patient recommend avoid sleeping pill alcohol evening , void go sleep , set alarm void least night . Also proper treatment infection recommended.3 Up 25 % patient report improved nocturnal continence use imipramine hydrochloride 25 mg bedtime . 14,16In prospective randomize crossover study compare 20 male enuretic patient ileal ONB receive oxybutynin versus verapamil , group show improved urodynamic parameter nocturnal continence status 70 % 55 % patient , respectively.17 Ali-El-Dein et al , report treatment female patient , NI RC ONB , anticholinergic drug ( tolterodine oxybutynin chloride ) associate improvement cure NI 36 % 23 % , respectively.15 These data confirm efficacy anticholinergic use treatment NI RC ONB . In current study , study role long act anticholinergic ( tolterodine 4 mg ) bedtime management NI RC ONB prospective randomize placebo-controlled crossover study . Material method : Patients : All patient RC ONB attend routine follow outpatient clinic Urology Nephrology Center evaluate eligibility inclusion study . Study design : A single center prospective randomize placebo-controlled crossover study . It hold Urology Nephrology Center , Mansoura University approval local ethical committee . Patients meet inclusion criterion include study . All patient evaluate proper history , examination , BMI , ICIQ-UI Short Form , urine culture , serum creatinine abdominal pelvic ultrasound . Patients positive urine culture treat appropriate antibiotic treatment till urine become sterile . Then , patient randomly allocate 2 group ( 1:1 ) computer generate random number . The first group receive long act tolterodine ( Incont LA , Adwia , Egypt ) 4 mg bedtime . The second group receive placebo bedtime . Both group maintain medication 4 week . After , group expose period two week washout crossed alternate therapy . Patients assess nocturnal incontinence number episode per week , number pad use ICIQ-UI short form questionnaire beginning study , 4 week , washout period end study . The ICIQ-UI short form develop assess prevalence , severity , impact quality life , type UI.19 The three score item ICIQ-UI SF : 1 . How often leak urine ? ( 0 `` Never , '' 1 `` About week less often , '' 2 `` Two three time week , '' 3 `` About day , '' 4 `` Several time day , '' 5 `` All time '' ) , 2 . How much urine usually leak ( whether wear protection ) ? ( 0 `` None , '' 2 `` A small amount , '' 4 `` A moderate amount , '' 6 `` A large amount '' ) 3 . Overall , much leak urine interfere everyday life ? ( Visual analogue scale range 0 `` Not '' 10 `` A great deal '' ) . Additional question use determine urine leakage occur . The answer result sum , minimum score 0 , maximum score 21 . Preliminary cut-off score set 0 = `` incontinence '' ˃1= `` urinary incontinence . Outcome measure : The primary objective study evaluate effect tolterodine 4 mg nocturnal incontinence . This do comparing effect drug group compare effect different group . Sample size : Assuming type I statistical error 5 % type II statistical error 20 % , design study power 80 % . Based result previous study , expect difference study control group 59- 70 % .15 , 17The drop number case suspect 10-20 % . So , sample size require give significant difference 60 arm . Statistical analysis : The ICIQ- UI score , number pad number nocturnal incontinence episode express mean± SD . Independent sample T-test use comparison mean . All statistical test do use Statistical Package Social Sciences 16.0 Microsoft ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) p value le 0.05 consider significant . The protocol accept local ethical committee Faculty medicine , Mansoura University ( Mansoura Faculty Medicine- Institutional Research Board MFM-IRB ) give number R/16.07.51 Figure 1 : study design time schedule</detailed_description>
