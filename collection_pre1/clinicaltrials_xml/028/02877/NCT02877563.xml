	<brief_summary>This study represent important step validate use contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEU ) clinical research tool use biologic readout new therapy Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) , clinically-reasonable method assess impact revascularization . The primary aim establish CEU limb perfusion image use accurately assess therapeutic improvement tissue perfusion link symptom improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Ultrasound Assessment Perfusion Changes After Peripheral Artery Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform patient know history PAD schedule undergo either surgical percutaneous revascularization . Limb rest-stress CEU perfusion image perform 3-4 week revascularization . Quantitative measurement pre-revascularization perfusion , post-revascularization perfusion , change perfusion compare symptom status ( Rutherford classification PAD [ Criqui ] questionnaire ) study point , data time onset claudication upright treadmill exercise study ( Gardiner protocol ) . Results angiography score allow determination relationship angiographic severity disease exercise perfusion .</detailed_description>
