	<detailed_description>Background Dental caries remain significant public health problem socioeconomic , dietary microbiological factor play major role risk factor initiation progression disease . It common cause toothache hospital admission young child . Dental caries school child cause pain , also impact school attendance , parent ' work hour , child 's ability eat , play sleep . Therefore , dental caries present significantly reduce health relate quality life child . Evidence-based study indicate oral health prevention cost-effective save child pain lose day school.Therefore measure take prevent developÂ¬ment dental caries could include bacterial biofilm control , dietary counselling , fluoride toothpaste , mouth rinse , varnish , gel foam , casein-derived remineralisation paste place resin-based/glass-ionomer pit fissure sealant . ) Professional fluoride varnish application become popular variety study discuss effect reduce dental caries . Fluoride varnish incorporate clinical dentistry reduce caries ; use U.S. increase progressively since approve FDA 1994 . Fluoride varnish 's effectiveness caries prevention , ease application , safety give advantage type topical fluoride treatment ( gel rinse ) caries management method . As result , regard one superior topical fluoride agent young child . Fluoride varnish also prolong contact time fluoride tooth surface reduce caries . Its active ingredient usually 5 % sodium fluoride , 22,600 ppm fluoride . It also recently gain much attention dentistry risk dental fluorosis also minimal.The simplicity application make suitable practical use dental clinic outreach dental service , especially young child special need group . Justification Despite availability free health dental service Sri Lanka , prevalence severity dental caries among six seven year old school child Sri Lanka stand high level accord result national oral health survey 1983/84 , 94/95 2002/2003 . The prevalence 78 % ( 83/84 ) , 76.4 % ( 94/95 ) 65.5 % ( 2002/2003 ) whereas dmft 4.4 , 4.1 3.6 . The simplicity application make suitable practical use dental clinic outreach dental service , especially young child special need group . Up date study carry cost effectiveness fluoride varnish application teeth Sri Lankan population . Therefore , result study beneficial implementation identification advantage fluoride varnish application teeth young child . Aim The main objective study evaluate cost effectiveness six monthly application sodium fluoride varnish prevention dental caries deciduous teeth , permanent incisor molar child six seven year Sri Lanka . The specific objective : 1 . To find association dental caries social status child ( e.g . mother 's education , father 's education , monthly family income etc . ) Methods Study Type : Interventional This double-blind , randomize control trial . A sample school child ( 6-7 year ) randomize varnish control group . All child receive routine caries preventive measure oral hygiene instruction , dietary advice professional cleaning . Children fluoride varnish application group receive fluoride varnish professionally apply prophylaxis every 6 month combine counsel maintenance oral hygiene diet period 2 year . Clinical examination child perform begin study 1 year 2 year later . All caries dentinal level group stabilize temporary restoration begin . For evaluation comparison , collect data subject statistical analysis . Both varnish control group subject use fluoride tooth paste 1000ppm . The control group subject counsel maintenance oral hygiene diet . During period , school visit four time six month interval recruitment , dental examination , fluoride varnish application . Recruited child randomly assign either treatment ( 5 % NaF varnish ) control group . Trained interviewer collect data oral health habit sociodemographic characteristic child . Information child 's diet collect 4-day food frequency diary . Caries examination conduct use International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS ) . The cost dental team 's school visit ; cost involve treatment dental caries throughout course study group evaluate compare end study . The sample size calculate 160 arm detect 5 % caries change 80 % power . Analysis The effect intervention measure term number caries prevent . The number new caries usual care intervention group calculate completion study . The intervention usual care group present demographic socioeconomic data . The cost intervention estimate . The cost treatment caries estimate intervention non-Intervention group . The cost estimate dental material , time human resource indirect cost . Quality life increment measure CHU-9D preference base instrument . Quality Adjusted Life Years ( QALYs ) calculate secondary outcome measure . A Markov model build assess cost effectiveness intervention perspective health system society . The result present cost per caries prevent cost per QALY prevent .</detailed_description>
