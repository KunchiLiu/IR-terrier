	<brief_summary>Extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) , birth weight less equal 1000 g , infant high risk develop brain injury first week life . Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) common injury group infant . Their incidence inversely proportional gestational age ( GA ) birth weight ( BW ) . These lesion associate neurodevelopmental delay , poor cognitive performance , visual hearing impairment , epilepsy , cerebral palsy ; instability systemic hemodynamics transition intra- extra-uterine life early neonatal period believe genesis . While incidence ultrasound- diagnosed cystic PVL decrease dramatically last 2 decade , diffuse PVL detect magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) still prevalent survivor neonatal intensive care . Moreover , PVL , even non-cystic , associate decreased cortical complexity brain volume eventual neurocognitive impairment . Currently , clinicians lack tool detect change cerebral perfusion prior irreversible injury . Unfortunately , incidence brain injury ELBW infant remain relatively stable . Once translated bedside , goal research develop monitoring system allow researcher identify infant risk IVH PVL future , intervention study initiate use change cerebral perfusion direct hemodynamic management . The purpose study first understand physiology brain injury eventually impact outcomes high-risk group infant assess ability diastolic closing margin ( DCM ) , non-invasive estimate brain perfusion pressure , predict hemorrhagic ischemic brain injury ELBW infant . The information collect study help develop algorithms monitoring plan maintain appropriate brain perfusion pressure thereby , prevent severe brain injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center , data collection research study premature ELBW infant high risk develop brain injury . This study do evaluate change brain perfusion measure DCM use comprehensive innovative brain monitoring platform encompass direct continuous measure cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , cerebral oximetry , cerebral autoregulation , partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) , arterial blood pressure ( ABP ) hop describe physiology brain injury correlate finding short- long-term outcome relevant ELBW infant . About three hundred ten ( 310 ) subject expect enrolled . Subjects ' active participation study may last one week total time follow birth approximately 24 month ( 2 year ) depend prematurity . Information subject ' medical record may access , review , record additional year final study visit . This study consist 5 study visit : Study Visit 1 ( enrollment visit ) , Study Visit 2 ( occurs 2-7 day enrollment visit ) , Study Visit 3 ( occurs approximately 2-4 month enrollment visit ) , Study Visit 4 ( occurs approximately 12 month enrollment visit ) , Study Visit 5 ( occurs approximately 24 month enrollment visit ) . STUDY ASSESSMENTS : - Medical Surgical History : The subject ' detailed history review record . The subject ' mother also ask question medical history . The mother ' medical record may also access . - Continuous Physiologic Monitoring : Monitoring perform include transcranial Doppler ultrasound , near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Ventilator : The high daily ventilator setting mean airway pressure ( MAP ) review record birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Head Ultrasound : A head ultrasound perform upon enrollment ( visit 1 ) assess early preexisting brain injury ( IVH ) . - Adverse Events : Any adverse event ( AEs ) , special event interest , unanticipated problem ( UPs ) subject may experience enrollment review record ( visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) . - Concomitant Medications : Review record medication interest subject take birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Blood Transfusions : Review record transfusion blood product perform subject part standard care birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Echocardiogram ( ECG ) Head Ultrasound : Review record ECG head ultrasound result perform subject part standard care birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Respiratory Interventions Suctioning : Review record respiratory intervention and/or suction perform subject part standard care birth 7 day life ( visit 1 2 ) . - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) : Perform MRI exam visit 3 . - Capute Scales Neurologic Exam : Perform assessment visit 4 assess subject ' development cognitive function provide early evaluation neurologic abnormality may relate brain injury . - Bayley-III Motor Sub-Test Exam : Perform assessment visit 4 assess subject ' development cognitive function provide early evaluation neurologic abnormality may relate brain injury . - Complete Bayley-III Exam : Perform assessment visit 5 assess subject ' development cognitive function provide early evaluation neurologic abnormality may relate brain injury .</detailed_description>
