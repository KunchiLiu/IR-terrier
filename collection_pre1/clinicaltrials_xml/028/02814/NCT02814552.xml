	<brief_summary>Hypertension ( HTN ) major risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , heart failure , kidney failure stroke . Disparities HTN prevalence , treatment control US persist decade . The prevalence HTN 44 % among Blacks , among high rate world . Those ethnic/racial , rural , socioeconomically disadvantage medically underserved population know bad blood pressure ( BP ) control . Awareness , treatment , control HTN optimal , varies accord race , whereby BP control ~53 % non-Latino Whites , 42 % non-Latino Blacks 34 % Latinos . Fundamental underlying difference pathophysiology contribute HTN among different race group . The United States ( US ) 2014 HTN recommendation outline race-based pharmacotherapy care HTN . However , recommendation use race-based population assumption Whites Blacks , include Latino ethnicity accompany guideline tool successful implementation , particularly rural primary care practice disparate population common . Moreover , recommendation apply initial therapy lack guidance subsequent regimen selection . The Optimizing Precision HTN Care Maximize BP Control Pilot ( OPTI-BP Pilot ) , directly address long know grow health disparity concern US include high rate death CHD stroke among Blacks poor rate HTN control among Latinos . Utilizing mixed method approach , overarch goal OPTI-BP Pilot test , use pragmatic trial design , personalize , algorithmic-based HTN management approach focus age , race , biomarker ( plasma renin activity ) treatment factor . The investigator hypothesize implementation precision-based approach care HTN community improve BP reduction ultimately reduce risk CHD , stroke death among affected HTN.OPTI-BP Pilot significant utilize innovative , systematic , precision-focused HTN management approach underserved , diverse population BP control currently suboptimal lay infrastructure groundwork broad implementation across area US minimize HTN related disparity improve HTN outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study develop pilot data support precise way treat high blood pressure base individual person 's specific characteristic . Information blood test call plasma renin activity enter on-line app may precisely determine medication use treat high blood pressure random selection . Renin substance body know affect blood pressure . By measure plasma renin activity , use select blood pressure lower medication may help precisely select medication base individual respond .</detailed_description>
