	<brief_summary>Acute stroke management represent true medical emergency require prompt diagnosis urgent treatment . In previous exhaustive cohort study conduct Rh√¥ne region , France ( AVC69 ) ( Porthault et al . 2013 ) investigator observe small percentage patient could access thrombolysis time . In cohort 1306 patient treat one emergency department Rhone region suspect stroke , 84 % patient reach hospital emergency department instead go directly stroke unit . Among patient , 2 % finally thrombolysed . A significant part patient arrive emergency department late thrombolysed . However , among subset ischemic stroke patient reach emergency department le 3 hour symptoms onset , clinical radiological exclusion criterion thrombolysis , 15 % thrombolysed . The hypothesis intervention design improve ED professional 's knowledge skill develop together efficient clinical pathway would decrease door-to imaging time consequently door-to needle time eventually improve overall thrombolysis rate . The investigator conduct cluster randomize control step wedge trial . All adult patient suspect stroke arrive one participate ED include study along five successive four-month period . The program feature : development write material ( booklet ) video ( film ) , one day session standardize training trainer , least one nurse one physician EDs , formal presentation improve knowledge , simulation improve skill use `` FAST '' tool ( nurse ) `` NIHSS '' score ( ED physician ) . Additionally , clinical pathway develop adapt general evidence base guideline local organization . The primary outcome door-to imaging time .</brief_summary>
