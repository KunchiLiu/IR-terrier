	<brief_title>Feasibility ANDAGO System Pediatric Neurorehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Children neurological diagnosis include congenital acquire brain lesion often impair low extremity function limit independence daily life activity . Achieving ability stand walk independently mention child parent high priority neurorehabilitation process . Robotic gait therapy deliver high-dosage ( i.e . number practice movement ) high-intensive ( i.e . number movement per unit time ) training intervention complement conventional treatment . Nevertheless , gap treadmill-based gait training free walking . HocomaAG ( Volketswil ) develop new mobile robot body-weight support gait training . ANDAGO bridge gap offer safe functional environment patient . Now , researcher would like investigate whether feasible apply prototype child adolescent undergo neurorehabilitation . Objective ( ) : As device apply pediatric rehabilitation set yet , researcher want investigate : - Feasibility : investigator examine technical feature well patient-related aspect , safety operability device static ( stand ) dynamic ( walk ) task . - Differences static dynamic task standing/walking ANDAGO supervise therapist . - Investigate handling ANDAGO . Patients time practice device Background Rationale : Children neurological diagnosis include congenital acquire brain lesion often impair low extremity function limit independence daily life activity .

Objective ( ) : As device apply pediatric rehabilitation set yet , researcher want investigate : - Feasibility : investigator examine technical feature well patient-related aspect , safety operability device static ( stand ) dynamic ( walk ) task . - Differences static dynamic task standing/walking ANDAGO supervise therapist . - Investigate handling ANDAGO . Patients time practice device researcher evaluate improvement static/dynamic task performance ANDAGO . - Determine patient ( characterized demographic neurological , cognitive functional status ) improve handle ANDAGO . - To investigate well healthy age- gender match child perform dynamic task ( obstacle precision course ) . Outcome ( ) : Feasibility : outcome focus applicability ANDAGO accord therapist ' patient ' feedback . The questionnaire include question satisfaction operability , comfort , safety handling device , harness control panel . Furthermore researcher investigate precision symmetric unload system help digital weight scale patient step onto . The researcher investigate static balance Kistler force plate ( Center Pressure parameter ) time accuracy walk without ANDAGO perform obstacle precision course . The investigator record outcome like time require perform task , gait quality Edinburgh Visual Gait Score smoothness walk Shimmer sensor , walk precision GoPro camera . Finally , researcher assess various characteristic functional cognitive outcome patient correlate measure performance handle ANDAGO . The investigator apply invasive measure assure test procedure limited keep burden participant acceptable . Study design : Open label feasibility study investigate applicability , safety handle ANDAGO system . Two appointment plan child within 48 hour window order avoid possible functional improvement due therapy . One additional appointment might plan clinical , functional neurological test normally part clinical routine . Healthy participant appoint . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : Children adolescents Rehabilitation Centre , age 5 18 year , include project . The investigator expect recruit 30 participant central motor disorder orthopaedic disorder include low extremity impairment . Further inclusion criterion : 1 ) patient large 135 cm , 2 ) capability understand follow simple verbal command , 3 ) ability initiate step . The exclusion criterion : 1 ) bone fragility low extremity , 2 ) inability maintain upright position lack head control , 3 ) uncontrolled hip , knee ankle instability , 4 ) elevate risk seizure , 5 ) low extremity contraction ( knee &gt; 20° , hip &gt; 20° ) , 6 ) presence skin lesion area contact harness support foot , 7 ) implantation baclofen pump , heart pacemaker cerebral shunt , 8 ) cognitive deficit limit communication pain discomfort , 9 ) limit compliance aggressive behaviour , 10 ) surgical correction botulinum toxic injection low extremity last two month . Healthy child adolescent cardiovascular , neurological musculoskeletal diagnosis . Measurements procedure : Clinical assessment perform therapist assess child 's functional status regard muscle strength , selective joint control , spasticity , gait ability cognitive function . All exercise perform without ANDAGO randomize order participant . At begin first appointment , stand exercise Kistler 's force plate do . Afterwards dynamic part exercise conduct . Participants walk along give path perform precision course , follow obstacle course . During second appointment , participant practice ANDAGO performs obstacle precision course . Improvements objectify reduced time need , low number prevent fall , high precision , good gait quality , improve smoothness walk etc . During measurement , child walk self-selected speed ( maximum velocity 2.1 km/h ) individually adjust body weight unload . Study Product / Intervention : The ANDAGO V2.0 new device . It consist stable walk frame allows patient walk reduce body-weight without fall over-ground . Control Intervention ( applicable ) : This feasibility study , RCT ; test , researcher investigate difference child 's gait capacity walk ANDAGO without difference healthy child child undergo neuro-orthopaedic rehabilitation . Number Participants Rationale : According literature , feasibility study interested discover usability early prototype consider valid include 3-20 participant ( Macefield 2008 ) . Due heterogeneous patient group potential drop-outs , investigator aim recruit 30 patient ( equal number healthy age- gender match control ) . These number also sufficient detect tendency difference within patient ( perform static dynamic task versus without ANDAGO , improve handle ) patient healthy control ( i.e . difference performance dynamic task group ) . Study Duration : June 2016 - February 2017 . Study Centre ( ) : Monocentric study : Rehabilitation Center Affoltern Albis Statistical Considerations : This RCT ; therefore primary hypothesis accompany sample size calculation . Depending distribution data , parametric non-parametric analysis ( e.g . paired-t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test within group difference t-test Mann-Whitney U test group comparison ) perform . The investigator correct multiple comparison ( e.g . Bonferroni correction ) . Pearson 's Spearman correlations coefficient calculate demographic characteristic clinical measure versus measure indicate improved handling .
