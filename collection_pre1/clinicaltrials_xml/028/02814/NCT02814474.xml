	<detailed_description>Background : Ketone body produce liver condition increase fatty acid oxidation , serve important fuel source fast starvation . They metabolize acetyl-CoA enters tricarboxylic acid cycle , enable ATP production independently glycolysis result low oxygen consumption per mole produce ATP compare glucose [ ref ] . Their primary physiological function appear alternative protein-sparing source energy extrahepatic tissue time reduced carbohydrate availability , prevent muscle wasting . The principal ketone body humans beta-hydroxybutyrate ( BHB ) acetoacetate . Increased ketogenesis feature common fasting , starvation diabetes mellitus . Ketones show number neuroprotective effect include anticonvulsant activity , improve cognitive function Alzheimer 's disease decreasing effect acute brain injury ischemic damage [ ref ] , well antitumoral effect glioma . This led suggestion ketone could use therapeutically number disease though currently recognize therapeutic use ketone form ketogenic diet treatment epilepsy . There limited vivo study effect ketone heart . It known fatty acid prefer myocardial fuel substrate shift increase use glucose , less extent ketone , time acutely increased demand . Interestingly , acute ketone infusion pig appear inhibit myocardial fatty acid oxidation . In vitro study suggest ketone decrease myocardial glucose uptake affect myocardial contractility , either increase decreased contractility ketone energy source . This investigated vivo . It therefore unclear extent ketone contribute myocardial metabolism condition hyperketonemia , affect contractility . The present project thus propose address issue outline , measure human cerebral cardiac uptake energy substrate , together functional parameter , use PET image appropriate radiotracers , experimental hyperketonemia . Hypotheses : 1 . An acute increase blood ketone concentration without previous ketoadaptation decrease cardiac palmitate glucose uptake healthy human . Materials method Effect acute ketone infusion cardiac perfusion 18F-FDG 11C-palmitate uptake healthy subject : Study population : 10 healthy volunteer . All study subject instruct follow standardise diet 1 week study . On study day , undergo baseline dynamic cardiac PET scan 15O-water follow 11C-palmitate 18F-FDG tracer , together baseline blood sample , muscle biopsy subcutaneous fat biopsy ass peripheral metabolic status . An intravenous infusion sodium betahydroxybutyrate initiate concentration rate sufficient achieve 1-2 mM ketonemia 30 minute ( assess blood sample ) . A second dynamic PET scan identical first perform continuous ketone infusion constant rate . Finally , second set blood sample , muscle subcutaneous fat biopsy take scan stop ketone infusion . Perspectives : The result research expect provide insight human heart metabolism respond increase ketone body , whether significant functional improvement . It contribute understand possible therapeutic benefit exogenous ketone administration fast relation cardiac function , implication treatment various disease diabetes heart failure . Knowledge ketone ' effect kinetics various radionuclide tracer also importance appropriate clinical use diagnostic PET scan patient elevate blood ketone level . In addition , implementation validation ketone PET tracer allow future non-invasive study directly measure ketone metabolism various tissue disease state .</detailed_description>
