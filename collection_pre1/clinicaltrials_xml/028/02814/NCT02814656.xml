	<detailed_description>AZD8871 new chemical entity possess long-acting dualpharmacology ( muscarinic receptor antagonist β2 adrenoceptor agonist [ MABA ] ) single molecule . This type agent present novel approach treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] potentially also asthma ( combination inhale corticosteroid [ ICS ] ) . AZD8871 develop inhalation , formulate alpha-lactose monohydrate deliver dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) allow delivery single dose study drug . By combine bi-functional activity , therapeutic goal AZD8871 treatment great efficacy single mechanism bronchodilator , equivalent long-acting β2-agonist ( LABA ) long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) administer free- fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) therapy , equivalent superior safety tolerability profile . The current study start single dose 300 μg AZD8871 placebo administer 8 healthy subject follow 3-day washout period , dose continue 12 day . Following 1st cohort , 2 cohort 8 subject administer multiple ascending dos ( MAD ) AZD8871 manner Cohort 1 . A MAD design select study follow first time man ( FTIM ) , single ascend dose ( SAD ) study . Each subject dose 1 cohort . The study design allow gradual escalation dose ( Cohorts 2 3 ) intensive safety monitoring ensure safety subject . In Cohort 1 , subject receive single dose AZD8871 300 μg placebo Day 1 , follow daily dosing Days 5 16 . The dosing schedule cohort single dose IMP ( active placebo ) Day 1 , follow daily dosing Days 5 16 . Within 5 7 day discharge unit , Follow-up Visit . Dosing Cohorts 2 3 precede safety review committee ( SRC ) meeting , decide exact dose give subsequent cohort . The dose escalation cohort exceed multiple 3 AZD8871 dose level study , cohort , exceed 2100 μg per day . The plan dose Cohort 2 either 600 900 μg , however SRC may decide different dose level . A minimum 5 subject active treatment need complete dose per cohort order proceed next dose level . The aim study also enable investigation healthy subject evaluate develop AZD8871 dual action bronchodilator acceptable side-effect profile compare inhaled bronchodilator market treatment COPD asthma .</detailed_description>
