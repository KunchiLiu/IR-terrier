	<brief_title>A Phase III Double-blind Study With Idebenone Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) Taking Glucocorticoid Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SIDEROS trial randomize , placebo control , parallel group study efficacy idebenone delay loss respiratory function , whilst also monitor safety tolerability idebenone least 266 DMD patient take stable dose concomitant glucocorticoid steroid . The study treatment period 18 months/ 78 week idebenone dose 900 mg/day . Participants use deflazacort prednisolone dose regimen . Since glucocorticoid steroid widely use ambulant boy early age late teenage even adult year , study take age ambulatory status account exclude patient need daytime ventilator assistance . The schedule assessment include Screening Visit 9 protocol visit , include Follow-up Visit . A Screening Visit take place maximum 6 week prior Baseline Visit ( Visit 1 , study day -1 ) . Beginning Baseline , patient receive study medication take home , undergo regular assessment clinic throughout study period Visit 8 Week 78 time study complete medication discontinue . All patient complete Visit 8/Week 78 , consider eligible Investigator able participate open-label extension study ( SIDEROS-E ) continue receive idebenone SIDEROS-E terminate Marketing Authorization obtain idebenone DMD , whichever occur first . The duration SIDEROS-E study define separate protocol . For patient participate extension study ( SIDEROS-E ) , Follow-up Visit ( Visit 9/Follow-up Visit ) take place 4 week end Treatment Visit 8/Week 78 premature discontinuation study medication . Each hospital visit include efficacy assessment ( respiratory function assess hospital-based spirometry , oxygen saturation , end-tidal CO2 ) safety assessment ( adverse event , concomitant medication , physical examination , vital sign , safety laboratory evaluation ) . In addition , respiratory function assess weekly home hand-held device order closely monitor respiratory function hospital visit . The study medication , medical procedure laboratory test , visit study centre free charge . In addition patient receive travel allowance cover reasonable expense study centre . Participants otherwise compensate study .</detailed_description>
