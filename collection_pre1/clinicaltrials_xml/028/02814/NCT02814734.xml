	<brief_title>Abdominal Compartment Syndrome : Diagnostic Prognostic Value CT Findings - Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) well know condition , occur patient host intensive care unit suffer acute abdominal disease ( severe acute pancreatitis , trauma , hemoperitoneum , surgery , infectious disease ) , large volume fluid resuscitation ( 2,5L ) , systemic disease severe sepsis major burn . This syndrome feature sustain intra abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) 20 mmHg , measure indirectly intra-vesical pressure , multiple organ failure due raise intra abdominal pressure . IAH , define abdominal pressure rise 12 mmHg , systematically lead ACS , often successfully cure medical therapy . When medial management fails , ACS present , surgical management appropriate consist decompressive laparotomy . CT examination order ACS diagnostic , radiologist aware condition CT find patient IAH , critically ill patient likely multiple CT examination diagnostic purpose initial condition , complication surveillance . Several radiological study determine CT finding IAH ACS . Most failed establish specific sensitive semiology IAH , due weak methodology ( except Al-Bahrani al. ) . The diagnostic significance `` Round Belly Sign '' ( RBS ) , first describe Pickhardt al. , debate since . None study evaluate prognostic value IAH CT finding . Some IAH CT finding may prognostic value , statistically link raise risk ACS overcome find at-risk patient population , proven IAH . The aim study evaluate diagnostic prognostic value CT finding IAH prospective way , high statistic value . These CT finding one previously describe previous review ( round belly sign , narrow abdominal vein , elevation diaphragm , bilateral inguinal herniation , bowel wall thicken enhancement , direct visceral compression ) one study first time ( increase peritoneal/abdominal ratio , semi-lunar line distension , concavity upper side para renal fascia ) . Design : For included patient , abdominal CT order , intra-abdominal pressure measure perform simultaneously CT examination . Presence absence IAH ACS note . Two radiologist ( one junior one senior specialize abdominal emergency image ) review CT examination note presence absence ten CT feature study , without know intra-abdominal pressure value . Patient follow-up : - 5 day follow-up - intra-abdominal pressure measurement - Incidence ACS time inclusion 28 day . - Evolution organ failures - Vital status 28 day - Medical surgical therapy apply Analysis : - Diagnostic value CT finding IAH - Prognostic value CT finding IAH , define CT feature statistically link ACS overcome , mortality 28 day Prevalence IAH expect 40 50 % patient state shock host ICU . Among , 20 % expect suffer ACS . Sensitivity RBS IAH 80 % accord Al-Bahrani al.. To evaluate diagnostic value RBS ( CI = [ 0,68 - 0,88 ] ) , 68 case IAH 140 patient include need . Based image habit center , length study expect 10 month .</detailed_description>
