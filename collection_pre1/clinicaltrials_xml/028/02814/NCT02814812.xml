	<brief_summary>Pancreatectomy represent classic approach resectable lesion pancreas , duodenum periampullary region . Due technical skill require , complex anatomy extreme fragility pancreatic parenchyma , pancreatic resection still consider risk postoperative complication mainly due pancreatic juice leak . Anastomotic leak major cause morbidity in-hospital mortality due activation pancreatic enzyme follow infectious hemorrhagic complication . Severe complication negatively affect postoperative outcome , long-term survival , quality life , cost . Operative mortality traditionally define rate within 30 day initial hospitalization . But pancreatic surgery mortality rate within 90 day pancreatic resection double 30 day . In present study , investigator seek evaluate usefulness postoperative CT-scan seventh postoperative day discharge patient detect undiagnosed postoperative complication .</brief_summary>
