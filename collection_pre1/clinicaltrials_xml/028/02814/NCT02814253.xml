	<brief_summary>This study do collect information use development new medical device . The new device intend help people COPD monitor condition home daily basis . The device use study call capnometer . Different type capnometer use doctor many year . Capnometers measure amount carbon dioxide breath . The device use study call N Tidal C. It small , battery-powered personal device use indoors either home , work hospital . The study fit around normal treatment , test medication COPD patient change make treatment study participant . The study last six week . Standard care clinical assessment take start study , 2 week , 4 week 6 week . The test COPD include check-up study doctor nurse include usual spirometry blood gas test . Each assessment visit last 15-20 minute . At start study participant train use device ask use device record normal relaxed breathing , 3 time day ( morning , afternoon evening ) every day 6- week period . A reading take seventy-five second ordinary breathing device . Participants feel unwell , infection , ask take frequent breath record six time day possible . This would twice morning , twice afternoon twice even , leave least hour reading . Participants also ask complete simple daily diary health COPD change information use device . Participants receive telephone call 2 week last assessment visit check ask medicine change . Participants benefit directly take part study device use study provide feedback . The information get study help u develop device , learn treatment management COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Breathing Record Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This uncontrolled , non-randomised , un-blinded longitudinal observational data collection study N-Tidal C data-collector capnometer patient COPD . Patients enrol one two cohort : community-based case manage patient chronic hypercapnia , hospitalise patient admitted via emergency room treatment COPD-related ventilatory failure . Patients give informed consent screen study . Patients case-managed group screen home routine clinic visit . Patients acute admission group screen admission hospital soon well enough understand study give write informed consent . The N-Tidal C data-collector capnometer explain patient train use . Case-managed patient ask use device home period approximately 6 week , 3 time per day ( morning , afternoon evening ) , 6 time per day feel start infection exacerbation . Hospitalised patient also use device 3 time per day in-patients continue monitor discharge hospital total period 6 week . All patient complete daily diary record . Case-managed patient undergo clinical assessment COPD screening home COPD clinic ; in-patients undergo clinical assessment COPD follow admission discharge hospital . All patient assess 3 time : second fourth week community , end 6-week assessment period . A brief follow-up review conduct approximately 8 week start capnometer monitoring . At assessment , capnometry measurement take addition routine spirometry , arterial ( in-patients ) capillary ( community ) blood gas . The trial interfere routine management patient 's condition .</detailed_description>
