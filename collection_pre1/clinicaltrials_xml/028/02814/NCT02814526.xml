MiniMental State Exam ( MMSE ) : ≥24 participant 13 year education ; ≥22 participant 12 few year education CDR =0.5 Impaired delay verbal recall indicate score meet least one follow criterion : Logical Memory II ≤ 8 ; Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Trial 7 ≤4 Speaks English fluently Visual auditory acuity adequate cognitive testing Completed least 6 year formal education work history sufficient exclude mental retardation Has informant know participant well , least weekly contact , available accompany participant clinic visit Sedentary underactive , determined response staffadministered Telephone Assessment Physical Activity ( TAPA ) survey Willing randomize either intervention group complete assign activity specify 18 month Willing able reliably travel identify YMCA , 4 time per week 18 month Ability safely participate either intervention complete 400 Walk Test within 15 min without sit use assistance Plans reside area least 18 month For plan travel , total time away must 2 month course study , 1 month one time ; participant must willing continue assign exercise program travel area 1 week In overall good general health disease plan surgery could interfere study participation Modified Hachinski ≤4 Stable use cholinesterase inhibitor , vitamin E ( 400 IU daily ) , estrogens , aspirin ( 81 300 mg daily ) , betablockers , cholesterollowering agent 12 week prior screen ( important biomarker analysis ) Stable use antidepressant lack significant anticholinergic side effect 4 week prior screen long participant meet DSM V criterion major depression currently last 12 month ; Geriatric Depression Score ( GDS ) score use inform clinical decision specify cutoff score inclusion When applicable , willing complete 4week washout psychoactive medication , include disallowed antidepressant , neuroleptic , chronic anxiolytic sedative hypnotic , willing avoid medication duration trial Able complete baseline assessment Any significant neurologic disease , MCI , include form dementia , Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , brain tumor , progressive supranuclear palsy , seizure disorder , subdural hematoma , multiple sclerosis , history significant head trauma persistent neurologic sequela know structural brain abnormality Sensory musculoskeletal impairment sufficient preclude successful safe completion intervention assessment protocol ; must able walk safely unassisted treadmill Contraindications MRI study , include claustrophobia , metal ( ferromagnetic ) implant , cardiac pacemaker Brain MRI screening show evidence infection , infarction , clinically significant focal lesion , include multiple lacunes prefrontal critical memory region ; inconclusive finding may subject review ADCS Imaging Core History major depression bipolar disorder ( DSM V criterion ) , psychotic feature , agitation behavioral problem within last 12 month History schizophrenia , per DSM V criterion History alcohol substance abuse dependence within past 2 year , per DSM V criterion Currently consume 3 alcoholic drink per day Clinically significant unstable medical condition , include uncontrolled hypertension significant cardiac , pulmonary , hematologic , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , metabolic systemic disease opinion clinic medical personnel may put participant increase risk , influence result compromise participant 's ability participate study ( treat atrial fibrillation 1 year occasional premature ventricular contraction ECG exclusion ) History last 6 month myocardial infarction , coronary artery angioplasty , bypass grafting , STENT placement History last 3 month transient ischemic attack small vessel stroke ( 3 month , small vessel stroke residual effect permit ) Expected joint replacement surgery within next 18 month History within last 5 year primary recurrent malignant disease exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , resect cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma situ , basal cell carcinoma , cervical carcinoma situ , situ prostate cancer normal prostatespecific antigen posttreatment Hemoglobin A1c &gt;
