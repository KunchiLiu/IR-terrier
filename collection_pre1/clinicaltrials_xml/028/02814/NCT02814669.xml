	<brief_summary>This study design assess safety tolerability atezolizumab give combination radium-223 dichloride participant metastatic CRPC progress treatment androgen pathway inhibitor . An adaptive design plan first investigate tolerability concurrent administration ( treatment begin Cycle 1 ) . However , combination tolerate , additional cohort may enrol evaluate tolerability radium-223 dichloride ( begin Cycle 1 ) delay atezolizumab ( begin Cycle 2 and/or 3 ) .</brief_summary>
