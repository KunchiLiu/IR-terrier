	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) child increase incidence time associated significant morbidity mortality . Despite , high-quality evidence-based treatment childhood AP current practice base entirely historical approach extrapolation adult study . In study , evaluate use early enteral feeding child AP . The traditional approach treat AP relies fast intravenous fluid ( occasionally parenteral nutrition ) assume minimizes stimulation already inflame pancreas . Contrary , evidence exists early feed patient AP may beneficial . Randomized control trial fast vs. early oral diet adult patient mild AP , show difference pain , serum amylase CRP level , also short hospital stay feed earlier . Further data adult severe AP demonstrate early enteral nutrition associate decreased mortality , infection multiorgan failure . These benefit lose enteral nutrition commence 48 hour admission . Suggested explanation finding include possibility enteral nutrition may maintain integrity function intestinal mucosa reduce gut-origin sepsis . Historically , nasojejunal ( NJ ) feed felt safer oral nasogastric feed set AP avoid cephalic gastric pancreatic stimulation . NJ feed require moderately invasive tube insertion radiographic endoscopic guidance . Recent data suggest oral feed low fat diet safe NJ feeding . Several animal model AP demonstrate exocrine pancreas resistant cholecystokinin ( CCK ) stimulation onset AP , suggest mechanism lack concern exacerbate pancreatitis enteral feed . Considering data less certain diet fat restriction contribute treatment AP . To challenge prior conception AP management necessary explore use unrestricted diet ( full fat ) mild-moderate pediatric AP , population recognize low complication risk . Despite mount evidence contrary , still standard clinical practice fast child AP , slowly reintroduce feed depend clinical improvement . This largely due lack clinical interventional study child AP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize control trial child acute pancreatitis , aim demonstrate , compare current standard approach fast intravenous fluid , early enteral ( oral nasogastric ) feed standard diet formula improve follow measure outcome : 1 . Length hospital admission . 2 . Serum amylase , lipase , electrolytes , calcium , magnesium , phosphate , urea , creatinine , liver function test , C-reactive protein ( biomarker inflammation ) , full blood count - routine blood test perform daily normalisation serum lipase discharge direct treat clinician thereafter . 3 . Weight presentation `` ready discharge '' , day 30 post-discharge clinic review . 4 . Systemic complication include hemodynamic instability , renal failure , intensive care admission . 5 . Analgesic requirement . 6 . Local complication include pancreatic necrosis , abscess , pseudocyst . 7 . Abdominal ultrasound finding hospital admission ( abdominal imaging direct treat clinician ) . At day 30-60 post-discharge , routine ultrasound ( assess localize complication ( ) e.g . pseudocyst ) clinical follow-up undertaken .</detailed_description>
