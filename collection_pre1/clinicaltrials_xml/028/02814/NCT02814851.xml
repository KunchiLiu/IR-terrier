	<brief_summary>The left atrium appendage ( LAA ) remnant original embryonic leave atrium form third week gestation . LAA believe function decompression chamber leave ventricular systole period leave atrial pressure elevate . The LAA also major endocrine organ main producer ANP ( atrial natriuretic peptide ) human heart . The ANP concentration 40 time higher LAA wall rest atrial wall . A study patient undergone maze procedure associate LAA removal find significantly low ANP secretion increase salt water retention . Whether could eventually lead hypertension heart failure symptom know . Removal LAA routinely perform antiarrhythmic surgical technique ( `` MAZE surgery '' ) reduce risk subsequent LAA thrombus . Furthermore , new percutaneous ablation technique target LAA reduce risk atrial fibrilation recurrence . However , addition effect diastolic atrial function atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) secretion , could potentially reduce stroke volume cardiac output may thus promote heart failure . Its removal could particularly detrimental patient exist heart failure high intraatrial pressure , would promote pulmonary congestion also reduce cardiac output . The study conduct CHU Brugmann Hospital , collaboration cardiac surgery cardiology ward . Subjects refer non valvular cardiac surgery prospectively include first 6 month follow onset protocol . Echocardiographic invasive data collect simultaneously . The goal study : - To evaluate immediate impact temporary closure LAA use vascular clamp beat heart human subject cardiac surgery . Impact LAA occlusion measure use transesophageal echocardiography hemodynamic measurement cardiac output . - To correlate echocardiographic parameter situ hemodynamic data . A significant role LAA cardiac hemodynamic include leave ventricle outflow might different clinical implication raise question : - Appropriateness LAA resection antiarrhythmic surgery - Importance restore sinus rhythm atrial fibrilation patient - Importance spare LAA ablation atrial fibrilation ablation avoid significant consequence cardiac function . - Appropriateness LAA occlude device atrial fibrillation patient .</brief_summary>
