	<brief_title>A Cost-Effective Handheld Breast Scanner Use Low Resource Environments : A Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2A study direct primarily prototype development , create , test , modify 4x4 finger array device small footprint battery power reliable . The test phase aim prove modification degrade screen sensitivity original lab prototype . Target enrollment 100 patient verify investigator reproducible value patient . Each breast evaluate compare whether consider normal abnormal tissue . Data patient normal abnormal region compare used determine predictive value accuracy prototype . The patient population woman men 18 year age old symptomatic breast lump either palpation imaging . Symptomatic individual schedule undergo diagnostic exam recruit patient present breast evaluation Dr. Brooks clinical practice meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Consent obtain prior study related activity . The PEFS evaluation perform trained individual . Subjects scan supine position without breast immobilization - similar ultrasound testing . The PEFS data record process automate software algorithm result display topographically breast-map red area show positive finding black area show negative finding . Quantitative data document analyzed accuracy metric . Results give subject record medical record . Because study clinical utility study , result effect clinical care decision . The PEFS evaluation may add 10 30 minute clinic visit . No image pathology test do research purpose .</detailed_description>
