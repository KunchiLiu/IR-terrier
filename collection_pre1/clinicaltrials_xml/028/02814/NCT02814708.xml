	<brief_summary>Toxic Shock Syndrome ( TSS ) severe condition high morbidity mortality host overwhelm inflammatory response cytokine storm . Staphylococcal superantigen toxin main causative agent . Toxic shock syndrome toxin ( TSST-1 ) responsible almost menstruation associate 50 % case . There specific therapy . The aim study extend safety tolerability two dos BioMed recombinant toxic shock syndrome toxin ( rTSST-1 ) Variant Vaccine one three vaccination healthy adult . The second aim study measure immunogenicity persistence antibody produce response treatment BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine period 12 month . These antibody expect important prevention mitigation disease . 140 healthy adult , male female , age 18-64 year assign 7 group comprise two dos vaccine adjuvant Department Clinical Pharmacology Medical University Vienna . The patient monitor vital sign , hematology , clinical chemistry , antibodies TSST-1 . Immunization repeat 3 month first dose 6 month second immunization respective group . Antibodies determine monitor TSST-1 binding antibody assess ELISA neutralize antibody ( exploratory endpoint ) assess inhibition T cell activation ( 3H Thymidine incorporation ; ≥ 50 % ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine develop Biomedizinische ForschungsgmbH one component polyvalent staphylococcal vaccine prevention toxic shock hyperimmunization donor production TSST-1 immunoglobulin . This prospective , randomize , parallel control , phase 2 study extend safety , local tolerance , immunogenicity , TSST-1 antibody persistence healthy adult , vaccinate one , two three dos BioMed rTSST1 Variant Vaccine compare adjuvant . Over period 60 day prior entry study , 145 male female subject 18 - 64 year age screen eligibility . Screening criterion include physical examination , medical history , pregnancy/ adequate contraception female , HIV Ab , hepatitis C virus antibody ( HCV Ab ) , hepatitis B antigen ( HBs Ag ) TSST-1 Ab . 140 qualified subject enter study . Group 1 receive 10 µg rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine two administration Adjuvant ; Group 2 receive dose Vaccine twice one dose Adjuvant ; Group 3 inject 10 µg Vaccine three time . Groups 4 6 give 100 µg Vaccine follow schedule . Group 7 receive Al ( OH3 ) adjuvant three time . Prior , 24 h ( +3 h ) vaccination , subject examine vital sign . Blood drawn hematology , clinical chemistry test , C-reactive protein . Local reaction adverse event assess post vaccination visit . The subject follow period 3 month ( ± 2 week ) optionally 18 month ( ± 12 week ) decide take part long-term follow-up , return clinic every three month ( ± 2 week ) . Tests perform include vital sign , local reaction , clinical chemistry , C-reactive protein . Adverse event record . Binding neutralize TSST-1 antibody determine prior vaccination every three month treatment follow-up period . Each participant study 12 14 , optionally 24 month , decide take part long-term follow-up . Immunogenicity define seroconversion TSST-1 Ab titer &lt; 20 &gt; 40 4-fold increase TSST-1 Ab titer . Neutralization define three-fold increase neutralization titer .</detailed_description>
