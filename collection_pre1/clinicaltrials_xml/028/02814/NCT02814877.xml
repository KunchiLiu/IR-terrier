	<detailed_description>Context : There steady increase incidence multidrug resistant bacteria , include become extremely resistant , cause infection difficult treat antibiotic thus dramatically impair patient prognosis . Several guideline prompt hospital set antimicrobial stewardship program , antibiotic referrer dedicate team key component . The aim study encourage good use antibiotic , contain emergence resistance . However , program , exist , cover multiple organisation intervention improve antimicrobial prescribing , involve actor different specialty . Furthermore , little information antimicrobial stewardship program actually implement hospital impact program difficult measure . Many study , mainly conducted England United States , evaluate intervention control antibiotic prescription hospital . Two meta-analyses conclude efficient variety intervention heterogeneity obtain result prevent conclusion practice strategy prioritize conduct antimicrobial control program . The study conduct far mostly monocentric evaluate impact intervention relatively short period time . Finally , rarely consider cost cost-effectiveness program . More qualitative approach highlight contextual cultural factor influence antibiotic prescribing habit encourage deliverer consider factor design intervention promote appropriate antibiotic use . These study also emphasize prescribers ' adherence guideline intervention fundamental factor success strategy . These aspect explore much French national context . Objective : The main goal evaluate efficacy cost-effectiveness strategy promote appropriate use antibiotic hospital identify efficient one , short-term also long-term scale . The secondary objective 1 ) map different antimicrobial stewardship setup French hospital determine strategy evaluate model ; 2 ) measure prescribers ' adherence different strategy use control antibiotic prescription , 3 ) identify potential barrier facilitator implementation effective stewardship program . Methods : The project team use model method technique combine decision tree Markov model estimate impact different strategy , consider associate cost . To define different strategy ( restrictive , educational structural strategy ) measure clinician ' adherence strategy implement setting , project team conduct survey sample 30 French hospital ( acute care ) . During section , project team also collect certain amount quantitative data ( antibiotic consumption per molecule , mean treatment length select infectionsâ€¦ ) . These data help u refine model 's parameter . To supply model , resource use : data relevant literature , computerized system medical databases Outcome measurement : Main objective : A comparison different strategy base incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , define difference cost intervention , divide difference measure impact ; secondary objective : accrue high-value information field antibiotic stewardship , namely physician ' adherence antibiotic counselling intervention control use , well potential barrier facilitator effective implementation program . Study population : Our study base model patient ' hospitalisation hospitalisation return hypothetical cohort patient , 10 year period .</detailed_description>
