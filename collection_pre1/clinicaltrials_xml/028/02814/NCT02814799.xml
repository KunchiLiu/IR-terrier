	<detailed_description>Thrombinography functional exploration haemostasis allow characterization kinetics amount thrombin . Its principle base record activity vitro thrombin , fluorometry . The formed thrombin lead signal activation fluorogenic substrate . The intensity receive signal correlated generation thrombin comparative measure fluorescence standard sample thrombinic activity know . The analysis realize specific software : Thrombinoscope® . The used reactional environment poor Plasma platelet ( PPP ) . The software define quantity thrombin generate ( nM ) accord time ( minute ) calculate value : - Lag time : latent period begin synthesis thrombin . - Start Tail : duration process . - Peak : peak thrombin , maximal rate generate thrombin . - ETP ( Endogenous Thrombin Potential ) : area curve represent total potential generation thrombin . - Time Peak : time require reach peak thrombin . It value serve criterion evaluation study . Osseous type The cancellous bone majority short bone epiphysis long bone . It crisp , constitute fine osseous patch arrange concentric way around wide open cavity , fill bone marrow rich cell , richly vascularize . The cancellous bone surround compact bone . At level tooth socket , osseous type find particular level interradicular septum . The compact bone establish cortical . It dense , consist system Havers . Every system form reduced central channel contain vascularized connective tissue , thick , concentric osseous small strip , prepares ostéocytes . This osseous type situate alveolar level external part . Inhibitors To verify possible way involve thrombin formation , investigator shall use specific inhibitor likely way activation : - An inhibitor extrinsic way coagulation : antibody anti tissue factor . - An inhibitor intrinsic way coagulation : bovine aprotinin . - An inhibitor phospholipid : annexin V. Methodology Research Plan investigation - Information eligible patient study ( patient require dental extraction bone removal ) concern method objective research mean information note . - If patient agrees participate study , realization osseous taking condition osseous taking freeze liquid nitrogen . - Put touch osseous taking plasma ( pools plasma use laboratory calibration various automatous ) measure genesis thrombin thrombinography . To make measure , osseous fragment put bottom well microplate 10µL buffer HBS add . The fragmentation osseous taking realize mean sterile material limiting time manipulation except environment . Every sample handle triplicate . Two well dedicated standard thrombin ( 20µL ) . Two control use : - positive control : 10µL tissue factor , concentration 1 5 pM 10µL PPL dilution 1/100 use . - Negative control : 20µL physiological salt solution use . Eighty microliters plasma go put well . Fifty microliters fluorescent substratum added mixture buffer - substratum fluorogenic beforehand prepared device go distribute 20µL mixture well , thus contain end 120µL . The measure make every 20 second 60 minute Fluoroskan Ascent Reader . The Thrombinoscope softwar® ( Version 3.0.0.29 , Maastricht ) convert intensity fluorescence nM thrombin accord time . The result measure group cancellous bone , compact bone , control FT1pM , control FT5pM secondarily average . According obtained result , sample ( compact and\or cancellous ) positive genesis thrombin analyze presence specific inhibitor various possible way activation coagulation . Calibrations make choose appropriate concentration inhibitor . Logistics study An information concern objective modality study give every patient benefit one several dental extraction bone removal . If patient agrees participate study ( oral agreement ) , osseous taking , associate automatically dental extraction keep . After take , osseous fragment immerse solution cryopreservation beforehand prepare , put freezer -70°C minimum 24 hour immerse liquid nitrogen . The measure trhombinography realize rate analysis every week , adaptable periodicity accord number recruitment make period .</detailed_description>
