	<criteria>A clinical picture compatible Acute Bacterial Skin Skin Structure Infections ( ABSSSI ) suspect confirm caused Grampositive bacteria , include Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . In addition local sign ABSSSI , patient least one following : 1 . Fever , define body temperature ≥ 38.4°C ( 101.2°F ) take orally , ≥ 38.7°C ( 101.6°F ) tympanically , ≥ 39°C ( 102.2°F ) rectally ( core temperature ) OR 2 . Leukocytosis ( WBC &gt; 10,000 mm3 ) leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 2,000 mm3 ) leave shift &gt; 10 % band neutrophils Infection either involve deep soft tissue require significant surgical intervention : 1 . Major cutaneous abscess characterize collection pu within dermis deep accompany erythema , edema and/or induration : 1. require surgical incision drainage , 2. associate cellulitis total affect area involves least 35 cm2 erythema , total affected area erythema least BSA ( m2 ) x 43.0 ( cm2/m2 ) , OR 3. alternatively , involve central face associate area erythema least 15 cm2 2 . Surgical site traumatic wound infection characterize purulent drainage surround erythema , edema and/or induration occur within 30 day trauma surgery associate cellulitis i. total affected area involve least 35 cm2 erythema , total affected area erythema least BSA ( m2 ) x 43.0 ( cm2/m2 ) , OR ii . alternatively , involve central face associate affected area least 15 cm2 3 . Cellulitis , define diffuse skin infection characterize spread area erythema , edema and/or induration i. associate erythema involves least 35 cm2 surface area , surface area erythema least BSA ( m2 ) x 43.0 ( cm2/m2 ) , OR ii . alternatively , cellulitis central face associate affected area least 15 cm2 In addition requirement erythema , patient require least two ( 2 ) follow sign ABSSSI : 1 . Purulent drainage/discharge 2 . Fluctuance 3 . Heat/localized warmth 4 . Tenderness palpation 5 . Swelling/induration Clinically significant renal impairment , define calculated creatinine clearance le 30 mL/min . Clinically significant hepatic impairment , define serum bilirubin alkaline phosphatase great 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) age , and/or serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) great 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) age . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day precede first dose study medication . Patients sustain shock define systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg child ≥ 10 year old , &lt; 70 mm Hg + [ 2 x age year ] child 1 &lt; 10 year , &lt; 70 mmHg infant 3 &lt; 12 month old 2 hour despite adequate fluid resuscitation , evidence hypoperfusion need sympathomimetic agent maintain blood pressure . Receipt systemically topically administer antibiotic Grampositive spectrum achieve therapeutic concentration serum site skin infection within 14 day prior randomization . An exception allow patient receive single dose shortacting ( halflife ≤ 12 hour ) antibacterial drug prior randomization . Infection due organism know prior study entry resistant dalbavancin ( dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) great 0.25 ug/mL ) vancomycin ( vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) great 2 ug/mL ) . Patients necrotizing fasciitis , deepseated infection would require &gt; 2 week antibiotic ( e.g. , endocarditis , osteomyelitis septic arthritis ) . Infections cause exclusively Gramnegative bacteria ( without Grampositive bacteria present ) infection cause fungi , whether alone combination bacterial pathogen . Venous catheter entry site infection . Infections involve diabetic foot ulceration , perirectal abscess decubitus ulcer . Patient infected device , even device remove . Examples include infection : prosthetic cardiac valve , vascular graft , pacemaker battery pack , joint prosthesis , implantable pacemaker defibrillator , intraaortic balloon pump , leave ventricular assist device , neurosurgical device ventricular peritoneal shunt , intracranial pressure monitor , epidural catheter . Gramnegative bacteremia , even presence Grampositive infection Grampositive bacteremia . Note : If Gramnegative bacteremia develop study , subsequently find present Baseline , patient remove study treatment receive appropriate antibiotic ( ) treat Gramnegative bacteremia . Patients whose skin infection result sustain full partial thickness burn . Patients uncomplicated skin infection superficial/simple cellulitis/erysipelas , impetiginous lesion , furuncle , simple abscess require surgical drainage cure . Concomitant condition require antibiotic therapy would interfere assessment study drug condition study . Sickle cell anemia Cystic fibrosis Anticipated need antibiotic therapy longer 14 day . Patients place hyperbaric chamber adjunctive therapy ABSSSI . More 2 surgical intervention ( defined procedure conduct sterile technique typically unable perform bedside ) skin infection , patient expect require 2 intervention . Medical condition chronic inflammation may preclude assessment clinical response therapy even successful treatment ( e.g. , chronic stasis dermatitis low extremity ) . Immunosuppression/immune deficiency , include hematologic malignancy , recent bone marrow transplant ( posttransplant hospital stay ) , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 , receive immunosuppressant drug organ transplantation , receive oral steroid ≥ 20 mg prednisolone per day ( equivalent ) &gt; 14 day prior enrollment , know suspected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect patient CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 past current acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define condition unknown CD4 count . Known suspected hypersensitivity glycopeptide antibiotic , betalactam agent , aztreonam , cephalosporin .</criteria>
