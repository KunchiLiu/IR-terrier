There grow interest characteristic feature ventricular repolarization lead lethal ventricular arrhythmia even use non-antiarrhythmic drug . The recovery time dispersion may reflect repolarization heterogeneity lead lethal ventricular arrhythmia . Although cheap convenient , traditional 12-leads electrocardiogram ( ECG ) frequently normal rest patient . The quantification repolarization heterogeneity ECG , QT dispersion , methodological limitation abandon daily practice . Many study show body surface potential mapping ( BSPM ) contain diagnostic prognostic information elicit 12-lead ECG . The BSPM magnetocardiogram ( MCG ) two new develop record method , provide high spatial resolution traditional ECG signal disadvantage high cost huge volume . It impossible use portable way . Previously , investigator utilize 64-channel low-TC SQUID MCG device develop verify 2 parameter , call smooth index QTc ( SIQTc ) T wave propagation ( TWP ) , accurately detect localize myocardial ischemia .
