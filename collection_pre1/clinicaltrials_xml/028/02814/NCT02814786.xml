	<brief_summary>This research lead first evaluation intrinsic dynamic joint muscle mechanic equinus cerebral palsy . It would provide direct cause effect relationship equinus bone deformity . Mechanical insight pathophysiology target muscle lead good understanding , thus , good medical surgical management equinus deformity . Secondary aim provide important insight whether key gait parameter exclusively rely upon surgical treatment planning evaluation . In medium-term perspective , depend upon result study , dynamic MRI ankle joint may serve guide tool fix equinus surgery case cerebral palsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Evaluation Ankle Joint Muscle Mechanics Children With Spastic Equinus Deformity Due Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Equinus common deformity child cerebral palsy . Spastic equinus typically defined inability dorsa-flex foot plantigrade , hindfoot neutral position knee extend position . Approximately 90 % deformity cerebral palsy occur ankle foot region alone incidence equinus around 75 % . Spastic equinus exhibit poor muscle control muscle weakness around ankle foot , result bone deformity gait abnormality . Non-operative conservative management equinus typically undertaken 8 year order prevent recurrent equinus overcorrection avoid high-growth phase child 's development surgical intervention . Despite precaution , long term follow-up study report 48 % recurrence rate post-surgery . Recurrence surgery increase economic burden society also debilitate impact child family . Previous research focus extrinsic risk factor CP type , demographic parameter , clinical gait parameter surgical recurrence none assess dynamic impact intrinsic bone deformity ankle joint muscle mechanic . A primary reason recurrence could lack understand bone deformity might force child adapt altered ankle joint muscle mechanic ( bone kinematics , cartilage contact parameter , muscle strain ) dynamic activity . In fact , surgical treatment fix equinus consider bone correction focus muscle release lengthening . Being dynamic pathology , critical understand vivo effect weak ankle joint musculature joint mechanic resultant bone deformity . However , effort make far literature . With advent technology , researcher develop validated dynamic magnetic resonance image technique analyze vivo muscle joint mechanic . Processing data enables researcher analytically track bone without identify specific point anatomical landmark thus provide ability track muscle motion well skeletal motion . Thus property bone kinematics , cartilage contact mechanic , musculotendon moment arm , muscle strain tendon strain available analysis . These technique successfully employ equinus research evaluate ankle joint muscle mechanic vivo .</detailed_description>
