	<brief_summary>The objective clinical trial investigate whether ladarixin sufficient activity ( preservation β-cell function slow-down progression T1D ) warrant development ( proof concept trial ) . The safety ladarixin specific clinical setting also evaluate . The study phase 2 , multicentre , double-blind study . It involve 72 patient new-onset type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , randomly ( 2:1 ) assign receive either ladarixin treatment ( 400 mg b.i.d . 3 cycle 14 day on/14 day - treatment group ) placebo ( control group ) . Recruitment competitive among study site , plan number patient enrol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T1D organ-specific autoimmune disease immune system attack insulin-producing β-cells . The onset disease typically occur adulthood seriously affect person 's quality life . T1D treat life-long daily exogenous insulin injection monitor blood glucose level . However , even optimization glucose control recent technology adequately substitute finely tune normal balance glucose level . Therefore , despite marked improvement diabetes care recent year , insulin-dependent diabetes result secondary long-term complication one lead cause end-stage renal disease , blindness amputation . Additionally , hypoglycaemia unawareness serious consequence recurrent hypoglycaemia often require emergency care . Maintenance residual β-cell function ( measure C-peptide response ) demonstrate associate reduced rate microvascular complication hypoglycaemia , improve quality life , overall reduction morbidity associate management cost . Therefore , pharmacological approach aim control autoimmune response restore self-tolerance pancreatic β-cells attract clinical/scientific interest . Among , rituximab , CD3-specific monoclonal antibody , GAD65 , DiaPep277 progress phase III clinical trial . Other agent , include cytokine modulators anti-TNF anti-IL1 , clinical evaluation . Unfortunately , even safe preservation β-cell function improvement glycaemic control evidence pharmacological approach evaluate far , none definitely approve `` treatment '' diabetes onset . New strategy evaluate combine agent target sequential arm immune inflammatory response involve β-cell disruption . In regard , IL-8 appear important mediator progression type 1 diabetes . Production secretion pro-inflammatory IL-8 demonstrate human pancreatic islet upon enterovirus infection , LPS-induced production IL-8 neutrophil increase type 1 pre-diabetic diabetic patient . In parallel , circulating level IL-8 elevate child T1D compare non-diabetic control . Specifically , level IL-8 correlate glycaemic control , high level associate poorer unfavorable glucose control . As result finding , modulation inhibition IL8 activity consider valid target development innovative treatment aim control progression T1D . Results obtain ladarixin mouse model T1D , particularly reversal `` diabetes '' NOD mouse , clearly show ability CXCR1/2 inhibitor protect β-cells either prevent delay progression hyperglycaemia . The positive effect ladarixin , couple safety show phase 1 study , provide sound rationale clinical study aim evaluate effect ladarixin patient new onset diabetes support conduct present study .</detailed_description>
