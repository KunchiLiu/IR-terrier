	<brief_summary>The question research project want explore whether use Prevena Incision Management System ( Prevena ) improve sternal wound edge oxygenation patient undergoing Coronary Artery bypass surgery Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery graft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevena Incision Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass gold standard surgical treatment patient complex coronary disease . It common operation 16000 procedure per year carry UK . Recent publication suggest bypass procedure leave right internal mammary artery use bypass coronary stenosis . It note use internal mammary artery result even good long term survival improve freedom cardiac event myocardial infarction coronary intervention use . The major drawback use internal mammary artery increase risk sternal wound infection breakdown . The investigator use Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) ass wound edge oxygenation delivery . The NIRS INVOS system investigator use within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals measure oxygenation soft tissue certain depth make suitable assessment wound edge oxygen delivery . Prevena commercially available CE mark . The Prevena wound management system differ conventional wound dressing , applies negative pressure close wound 7 day . Wound complications/infections decrease type wound management system use . Studies suggest Prevena achieve outcome increase perfusion wound edge keep wound dry . Patients randomise either Prevena wind management standard care NHS wound management procedure . The oxygenation outcomes wound compare data collection patient follow routine inpatient care 6 week outpatient appointment .</detailed_description>
