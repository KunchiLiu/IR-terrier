	<brief_summary>Patients receive radiation therapy still risk side effect due off-target radiation damage normal tissue The number cancer patient expect increase 14.1 million around world 2012 19.3 million 2025 . Up ten percent develop late severe gastrointestinal complication ( i.e . Pelvic Radiation Disease - PRD ) . Symptoms proctopathy ( 5-20 % ) radiation-induced cystitis ( 3,5 % ) affect quality life . The treatment PRD limit manage symptom ; new alternative propose . Clinical trial use MSCs treat hemorrhagic cystitis , proctopathy demonstrate feasibility use MSCs pathology : - MSCs successfully repair hemorrhagic cystitis , perforate colon patient hemorrhagic cystitis , perforate colon peritonitis . - Six clinical trial currently ongoing proctopathy , 3 phase III . Results suggest inhibition chronic inflammation fistulization interruption hemorrhagic syndrome . - Clinical trial evaluate efficacy MSCs treat hemorrhagic cystitis progress . - A decrease pain injection MSCs observe patient treated radiotherapy breast cancer , radiation burn , radiotherapy over-dosage . - Four patient , treat MSCs receive overdose pelvic irradiation prostate cancer . A decrease pain ( EN score ) , bleed diarrhea observe . MSCs represent promise alternative strategy treatment severe enteritis , rectitis cystitis radiotherapy , may avoid surgical treatment may diminish adverse effect PRD term chronicity , morbidity , mortality health cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Efficacy Systemic Mesenchymal Stromal Cell ( MSC ) Injections Treatment Severe Chronic Radiotherapy-induced Abdomino-pelvic Complications ( Pelvic Radiation Disease , PRD ) Refractory Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-Chemo-radiation enhances survival also increase risk PRD . The result increase - Cost society ( repeat hospitalization palliative care ) - An ethical problem help patient irreversible degraded quality life . Results conventional therapy PRD reveal poor long-term efficacy : i. Coagulation plasma argon insufficient , 58 % 6 month ; ii . The efficacy formalin questionable ( 48 % ) , 5-amino-salicylate , sulfasalazine , vitamin E pentoxifylline ; iii . The efficacy short chain fatty acid hyperbaric oxygen therapy low ( 40 % ) ; iv . Steroids limit efficacy ( 37 % ) . v. A surgical operation irradiate field associate difficult impossible heal well risk infection ( mortality 5 % within 40 month ) Furthermore , conventional therapy palliative badly tolerate . More effective approach thus crucial . - PRD unfortunately remain major side effect radiotherapy establish effective treatment . Consequently , recruitment aforementioned number patient participate radiotherapy center ensure . - MSC therapy safe suitable option severe PRD . - The investigator propose proof concept . - MSC production injection protocol already successfully employ compassionate therapy four patient , suffer chronic fistulizing colitis , radiotherapy prostate cancer . - PRISME network project include St Antoine Hospital , INSERM ( National Institute Health Medical Research ) , EFS ( French Blood Establishment ) , CTSA ( Army Centre Blood Transfusion ) ECellFrance , IRSN ( Institute Radiological Protection Nuclear Safety ) , IGR ( Gustave Roussy Institute ) , Institute cancerology west France . Our consortium robust experience treatment radiation damage , preclinical model medical management PRD use biotherapy . Clinical scientific achievement , previous collaboration different group preliminary partner 's data assure fulfillment program . - Patient selection perform six radiotherapy center participate study . The expected recruitment per center conclude average number potentially eligible patient treat survey follow center ( St Antoine Hospital , Gustave Roussy Institute , Institute cancerology west France ) . - The ECellFrance platform ensure MSC production . This platform include two location Parisian region : EFS ( city Creteil ) CTSA . - Support , trial intervention protocol handle Department Clinical Hematology St Antoine Hospital , renowned expertise treatment overdose radiation therapy patient , i.e . Epinal case ) manage PHRC use MSCs . - Participation research group robust experience stem cell , transplantation ( Research centre Saint Antoine , INSERM ) radiobiology , cell therapy treatment radiation accident ( IRSN , CTSA ) . These group carry characterization biological activity immunological property native MSC bone marrow tissue vitro ( INSERM ) vivo ( IRSN ) immunological monitoring patient treat MSC ( INSERM ) . It expect achieve heal chronic refractory disease , lead low health expense reduce patient treatment hospitalization , increase quality life : - Decrease rectorrhagia hematuria , pain , drug-consumption ; - Inhibition hemorrhagic syndromes chronic inflammation accompany sustained fistulization arrest due repair capability MSC . The expected result public heal chronic refractory disease , lead low health expense reduce patient treatment hospitalization , increase quality life . Hypothesis : MSC injection provide efficient alternative approach treatment PRD patient refractory conventional treatment . Patient study schedule : D-60 : Screening 6 radiotherapy center . D-1 : Inclusion Saint Antoine Hospital . D0 , D7 D14 : IV MSC injection ( 2x106 - 6x106/kg MSC ) . M2 M4 : follow-up visit . End patient 's participation study M4 . Total number schedule patient : 12 patient suffer PRD . Simon minimax plan , P0=25 % , P1=60 % , Alpha=5 % Beta=20 % . Stopping rule : Step 1 : ( n1=5 ) inclusion 5 patient r1=1 : number success &lt; 2 , study end MSC inefficacy . If number success ≥2 , proceed step 2 . Step 2 : ( n2=7 ) inclusion 7 patient r2=5 : soon number success reach 6 ( &gt; r2 ) , inclusion discontinue MSC consider sufficiently promise study .</detailed_description>
