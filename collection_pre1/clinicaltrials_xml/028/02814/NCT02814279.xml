	<brief_title>Comparison Two Flaps Root Coverage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel control clinical trial . The population evaluate study select Institute Science Technology ( ICT ) , São José do Campos , College Dentistry . Patients assign one three treatment group : - Group TUN+CTG ( 21 ) : Periodontal surgery root coverage tunnel flap technique plus connective tissue graft . - Group CAF+CTG ( 21 ) : Periodontal surgery root coverage trapezoidal flap plus connective tissue graft . All surgical procedure perform single operator ( MPS ) . The gingival recession defect randomly treat either trapezoidal-type coronally advanced flap plus connective tissue graft ( CAF+CTG ) coronally advanced tunnel technique subepithelial connective tissue graft ( TUN+CTG ) . In brief description , CAF treatment perform start two divergent release incision lateral recess area . A sulcular incision make unite releasing incision flap raise beyond mucogingival junction ( MGJ ) split-full-split thickness . The connective tissue graft remove palate suture position . Sling suture place stabilize flap coronal position 2 mm cement-enamel junction ( CEJ ) , follow interrupted suture close release incision . The tunnel flap perform initial sulcular incision , spit thickness flap prepare use specific tunnel knife beyond mucogingival junction flap gain mobility . The flap laterally extend adjacent papilla carefully detach mean full-thickness preparation . The connective tissue graft insert tunnel . Sling suture perform involve flap graft coronally cover 2 mm CEJ . After surgery , participant request take 500 mg sodium dipyrone every 4 hour 3 day case pain , avoid brush flossing treated area period 2 week . During period , plaque control perform use 0.12 % chlorhexidine rinse use twice day . The suture remove 7 day , patient recall prophylaxis reinforcement motivation instruction atraumatic tooth brush study period . Clinical , esthetic , comfort patient parameter assess 45 day , 2 , 3 6 month procedure . Quantitative data record mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , normality test use Shapiro-Wilk test . The probe depth ( PD ) , relative gingival recession ( RGR ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , keratinize tissue thickness ( KTT ) , keratinize tissue width ( KTW ) , dentin hypersensitivity ( DH ) value examine two-way repeated measure ANOVA evaluate difference within group , follow Tukey test multiple comparison Shapiro-Wilk p value ≥ 0.05 . Those present Shapiro-Wilk p value &lt; 0.05 analyzed use Friedman test ( intragroup comparison ) Mann-Whitney test ( intergroup comparison ) . Patients ' esthetic discomfort measure use visual analog scale ( VAS ) analyze T-tests . The frequency complete root coverage compare use χ2 test . Intergroup root coverage esthetic score ( RES ) comparison perform T-test . A significance level 0.05 adopt .</detailed_description>
