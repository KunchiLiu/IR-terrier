	<detailed_description>IRD present significant burden NHS well individual family . IRDs particularly difficult family situation due guilt complex emotion relate inheritance pattern . Poorer mental health report patient retinitis pigmentosa , manifest range way include stress , depression anxiety , particularly disease progress . This probably caused uncertainty disease process progressive nature degeneration . Recent work report quality life significantly deteriorate drop visual field diameter 20 degree drop visual acuity lower LogMAR 0.3 ( equivalent 6/12 ) . Contrast sensitivity often use conjunction VA ass visual capability . It measure ability see reduce contrast major impact utility vision . Relating contrast sensitivity function quality life provide valuable information whether aspect vision critical measure patient health . This especially important novel treatment develop treatment IRDs .</detailed_description>
