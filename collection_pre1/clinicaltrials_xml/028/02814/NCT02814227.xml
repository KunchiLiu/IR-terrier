The product design FDA-approved over-the-counter device patient wear sleep wake color score red , yellow , green depend sleep apnea status . The feature product include home-based ; easy use ; non-invasive ; wireless ; disposable ; low cost ( $ 20-50 ) ; present easily understandable test result . However , device must first validate gold-standard polysomnography . The specific goal project compare Zansors® micro sleep sensor screen device gold-standard polysomnography establish device 's preliminary validity screen OSA accurately .</detailed_description>
