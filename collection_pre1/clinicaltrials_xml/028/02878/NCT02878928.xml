	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluating Effects Pharmacogenetic-guided vs Standard-of-Care Treatment Depression and/or Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial number patient take anti-depressant anti-anxiety medication suffer either lack benefit drug therapy severe side effect . Clinical feature often fail predict drug response tolerability patient prescription medication . Genetics help guide therapeutic decision patient exhibit neuropsychiatric disorder potentially improve patient outcomes maximize drug efficacy minimize risk adverse event . Genetics drug interaction alter pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics multitude drug compound turn influence safety efficacy select therapeutic regimen . This study design evaluate clinical impact pharmacogenetic ( PGx ) -directed treatment . Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection use IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel enhance patient response tolerability facilitate selection appropriate medication effective dose short possible time . In prospective , multi-center , randomize , subject outcome evaluator blind , parallel-group study patient present clinical site evidence depression and/or anxiety determine qualified clinician invite participate . Study participant randomize one two group respect IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result : group test result reveal medical provider prior treatment selection ( Experimental Group ) group without test result prior treatment selection ( Control Group ) . Participant outcome measure baseline throughout 3-month duration study .</detailed_description>
