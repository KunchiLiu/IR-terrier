	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate real-time gap detection use EPD D700 dielectric sensing compare customary electrical isolation test Adenosine infusion end procedure . Furthermore , safety , usability clinical applicability system guide AF ablation confirm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DURABLE-I Study : Dielectric Unravelling Radiofrequency ABLation Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , single-center , non-randomized , non-blinded , open label , single arm study . All procedure perform CARTO-3 guidance treatment atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . The EPD D700 system use in-tandem , record pre- , immediate post-ablation tissue characteristic compute likelihood lesion transmurality permanency . Additionally , D700 system safety , feasibility , usability clinical applicability document . The entire procedure conduct customary , use standard approve off-the-shelf equipment ( body surface electrode , diagnostic irrigate ablation catheter , RF generator record system ) , completely clinically independent manner EPD D700 system . The physician neither use rely D700 system output clinical decision making blind D700 lesion assessment forecast . After 30 day follow initial procedure , repeat procedure perform gap detection result correlate D700 prediction .</detailed_description>
