	<detailed_description>Currently best curative treatment massive haemoptysis surgical resection affect portion lung . For patient qualify surgery , alternative intervention , provide temporary solution . Surgical resection diseased area , offer possibility cure , best perform elective procedure . It carry insignificant mortality , report vary 1 % 50 % . Unfortunately , many patient admit Tygerberg Academic Hospital , candidate either elective emergency surgical resection . The common reason inoperability : irresectable disease ( i.e . damage lung bilateral extensive allow resection , site bleed know ) ; severely reduce cardiopulmonary reserve secondary extensive pre-existing lung damage , make lung resection surgery impossible due excessively high mortality risk . Repeat BAE ( palliative measure inoperable case ) always technically feasible always lead cessation bleeding . Additionally long term recurrence rate follow BAE variable estimate 18-42 % , carry high mortality . A significant number patient massive haemoptysis qualify either surgery BAE , thus render without treatment option , save palliation long-term opiate . Their fate recurrent haemoptysis high associate mortality . Endobronchial occlude device consider , however high cost require expertise prohibits extensive use . A novel treatment condition potentially external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) . A case report five patient document EBRT set mycetoma 7 14Gy use , cessation life threaten haemoptysis . However follow-up limited 6 month , effect EBRT set post-tuberculous structural lung disease without mycetoma know . The potential mechanism achieve haemostasis speculate induction radiation damage radiosensitive capillary , subsequent inflammatory response , keep previous rat model lung perfusion follow high dose ( 30Gy ) EBRT exposure . There therefore paucity data utility EBRT benign condition bronchiectasis aspergillomata . Furthermore due different effect , particularly temporal , radiation normal benign condition difficult extrapolate malignant scenario benign . Laboratory study however demonstrate effect high dose radiation tissue may result reduce bleeding tendency . This study aim explore novel therapeutic strategy patient life-threatening haemoptysis candidate definitive management ( i.e . lung resection ) . This study also aim establish measurable response vary dos chest radiation case haemoptysis cause benign condition . This study prospective randomise control-intervention study . Patients allocate one 2 arm ( control EBRT 3.5Gy weekly 5 fraction maximum 17G ) . The primary outcome time recurrent haemoptysis . Secondary outcome include physical performance , lung function occurrence EBRT complication . Patients follow daily whilst hospital one year post intervention . Assessors perform statistical analysis blind group allocation . Statistical analysis include univariate multivariate analysis appropriate parametric non-parametric test . Appropriate test categorical data ( e.g . Chi-squared test ) continuous data ( e.g . Kruskal-Wallis , ANOVA ) use . Logistic linear regression model use certain outcome , multivariate analysis perform use step-wise regression model full modelling appropriate .</detailed_description>

The cause haemoptysis must due severe underlie lung destruction/ bronchiectasis , posttuberculous lung damage presence aspergillomata . Primary bronchial artery embolisation consider technically possible fail BAE Lung resection possible poor cardiopulmonary reserve ( define current ERS/ESTS clinical guideline , independently review team consist thoracic surgeon , pulmonologist anaesthetist need agreement inoperability and/or lack cardiopulmonary reserve ) Active tuberculosis High clinical suspicion lung carcinoma Known deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism Any social psychological condition may impair insight compliance study include follow Any condition , opinion investigator , place subject increase risk transport administration EBRT e.g . severe haemodynamic instability , mechanical ventilation high FiO2 requirement etc .</criteria>
