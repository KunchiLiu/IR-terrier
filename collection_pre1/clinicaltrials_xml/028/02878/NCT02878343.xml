	<detailed_description>Analysis Plan Statistical Considerations Descriptive analyse We produce data summary regularly use frequency categorical variable mean , median , range continuous variable . We assess data quality examine distributional assumption graphical method . To evaluate balance among group achieve randomization , compare baseline value variable across 4 arm use appropriate test . General procedures All primary analysis intent-to-treat basis include participant group s/he randomize , regardless adherence assign strategy . Given high rate miss data typical weight loss study , handle miss data important issue . Primary analysis use multiple imputation miss in-person weight outcome 18 month , use randomization stratum , study arm baseline variable predictor imputation model . Sensitivity analyse perform imputation model also use post-baseline data , at-home weight data , frequency weigh home , recent weight loss trend drop , well analysis assume participant follow-up weight loss data unavailable weight return baseline ( weight begin Pre Phase ) . Within arm , last assumption likely conservative may case inter-arm comparison , depend dropout rate different arm true follow-up weight dropout . Thus , key secondary analysis consider effect differential dropout among treatment arm . Finally , also consider per-protocol type analysis , examine difference intervention arm complete case data . Efficacy Analyses All hypothesis test use two-sided , 0.05-level test unless otherwise specify ( notably Holm test approach use five primary hypothesis Specific Aims 1-4 ) . The primary analysis unadjusted intent-to-treat analysis , use t-test difference weight change baseline 18 month , measure in-person weight , intervention group control group , combine compare single intervention , apply Holm p-value correction multiple comparison test procedure . If weight change appear non-normally distribute blind data , find appropriate transformation use non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Missing data handle described . Weight change baseline 18 month , 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) , estimate comparison adjust analysis . We estimate regression model adjust stratification variable ( sex , employer , initial BMI ) participant characteristic factor include race , income , education . We evaluate evidence confound use change estimate criterion . We fit exploratory model repeat weight measurement incorporate time polynomial function use visit-specific indicator variable determine parsimonious model adequately describe observed pattern . Models build separately in-person home weight data . We investigate random-effects model allow baseline individual variability well variability change weight time ; example following : E ( weightij ) = 0 +1Timej + 2Groupi+ 3Xi + b0i + b1i Timej , indicate subject , j indicate assessment time , parameter fix effect link time , treatment group vector , vector demographic clinical covariates Xi outcome , b0i b1i random intercept slope effect . Tests significance random effect use likelihood ratio test nest model ; compare model different random effect structure use maximize log-likelihoods Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . We apply standard diagnostic technique assess model adequacy . We use treatment time interaction ass whether rate change weight differs intervention arm . We hypothesize incentive may effective among low income individual evaluate use interaction term income treatment group . We explore differential effect race education baseline level intrinsic motivation stage change . We also consider potential mediator , home food activity environment . To assess sensitivity treatment effect estimate miss data , fit hierarchical mixed effect model without account informative miss data . For Specific Aim 5 , ass cost intervention arm employer social perspective compare cost difference arm relative effectiveness measure incremental weight loss achieve . The principal incremental cost-effectiveness ratio intervention control arm employer 's perspective compare cost intervention baseline 18 month per unit change weight . Secondary analysis 1 ) evaluate ratio use either 6 month post- intervention data ( 24 month visit ) 12 month intervention data ( 12 month visit ) 2 ) evaluate 2 ratio use limited social perspective . Cost model use generalize linear model log link gamma family . Missing data strategy parallel describe . We assess sample uncertainty comparison cost effect calculate parametric 95 % CIs cost per kg lose acceptability curve . Standard error correlation difference cost effect derive use bootstrap procedure . 11.2 Power Sample Size Considerations We design study adequate power detect difference weight loss 18-month period . Our intervention achieve maximal impact maintain initial weight loss end Phase II ( month 18 ) , incentive payment cease . To maintain experiment-wide Type I error guard false conclusion effectiveness , use Holm multiple comparison adjustment test 5 primary comparison Specific Aims 1-4 . If intervention effective hypothesize , propose sample size maintains great 90 % power show significance three intervention arm compare control great 80 % power show significance combine intervention group compare two intervention alone . We plan recruit approximately one third 328 participant required start Phase I participate employer ( IBC , SEPTA , City Philadelphia ) . Given large number potentially eligible employee , , need , easily increase proportion participant employer meet recruitment target . The 328 participant randomize 3 intervention group control group use 1:1 ratio intervention arm . We build margin 20 % potential attrition 18-month assessment , result 260 participant ( 65 per arm ) available analysis end Phase II . This provide u great 90 % power detect difference weight change baseline 18-month weigh-in 5 kg single intervention group control group ( primary outcome Specific Aims 1-3 ) 87 % power detect 3 kg difference combine group either incentive environmental strategy group ( Specific Aim 4 ) . Namely , great 85 % power 5 primary comparison interest expect weight change month 0-18 -8 kg , -5 kg 0 kg combine , intervention control group , respectively ( net difference single intervention control group 5 kg , combine intervention control group 8 kg , 3kg single intervention combine group ) assume standard deviation ( S.D . ) weight loss 5 kg . We also great 80 % power detect difference 4.6 kg weight change single intervention control group 7.3 kg combine control group ( primary outcome Specific Aims 1-3 ) , maintain approximately 80 % power 2.7 kg difference combine single intervention ( Specific Aim 4 ) . For secondary outcome ( Specific Aim 5 ) , wish compare cost difference arm relative effectiveness measure incremental weight loss achieve . We calculate point estimate cost per kg weight loss base estimate inter-arm difference weight loss incremental cost intervention , describe C.3.d.ii.c . For weight loss 18 month , give expect incremental cost $ 810 ( incentive ) incremental weight loss 5 kg , 328 participant provide 80 % power detect cost per kg lose $ 430 great 90 % power detect cost per kg lose $ 575 . This study primarily test efficacy intervention . Due resource constraint yet know intervention effectiveness , power study base cost effectiveness analysis . Estimated detectable cost per kg function wide confidence interval due sample size . 11.3 Measurement effect : The goal analysis assess relative weight loss intervention arm relative control . For principal cost-effectiveness analysis , measurement incremental weight loss base difference weight baseline 18 month visit ; secondary analysis base weight difference baseline 24 month baseline 12 month</detailed_description>
