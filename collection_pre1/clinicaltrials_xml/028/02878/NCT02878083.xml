	<brief_summary>The main objective project demonstrate feasability endomicroscopic biomarker efficacy vedolizumab adalimumab , Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) couple vedolizumab fluorescent component , FITC ( Fluorescein isothiocyanate ) , adalimumab rhodamine . This project allow development biomarker therapeutic efficacy vedolizumab adalimumab use single time-frame vivo human , respect manufacturing standard Good manufacturing procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Biomarker Efficacy Vedolizumab ( EnTyvio® ) Patients With ulcErative ColiTis ( DETECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit initiation vedolizumab injection . The schedule vedolizumab infusion correspond protocol follow-up visit ( Week 0 , W2 , W6 , W14 , W22 ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy appointment perform Week 0 22 . For responder patient , end study occur two week last vedolizumab infusion ( W24 ) . At week 22 , nonresponder patient vedolizumab may treat adalimumab absence contraindication depend decision physician responsible patient . Patients treat every two week 8 week . The protocol follow end 2 week fourth adalimumab injection . During W0 W22 , colon biopsy collect . Blood sample collect W0 , W2 , W6 , W14 , W22 ( W30 non responder ) .</detailed_description>
