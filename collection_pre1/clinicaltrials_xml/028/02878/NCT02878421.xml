It increasingly recognise nicotine significant atherothrombotic effect . Therefore , clinician unable confidently recommend ECs less risky alternative TC . Hypothesis : Endothelial function improve EC compare TC measure flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) . Potential benefit : This study provide information potential use device risk and/or benefit associate , specifically relation vascular health .</detailed_description>
