	<detailed_description>This research project continuation NOFAR project , collaboration ELMINDA Tel-Aviv University , include proof concept technology develop university characterize cortical layer use magnetic resonance . In light promise result , partner decide make another leap forward , test technology amongst specific patient population suffer brain trauma ( traumatic brain injury , TBI ) . Early proper diagnosis brain injury critical , since prevent complication patient 's health . The test currently available limited ability provide comprehensive accurate assessment injure brain : imaging exam CT , MRI PET help identify location severity injury provide data cognitive functional effect injury . On hand , neuropsychological test allow examination current cognitive functioning , cognitive decline quantification do accord mathematical model subjective assessment patient family . Therefore , area lack important find objective measure enable quantification brain injury indication cognitive decline . The current project , last two year , combine data collect exist innovative technology : fMRI scan , map brain connectivity use EEG combination eye-tracking technology ( BNA technology develop ELMINDA ) , characterize cortical layer use magnetic resonance ( CoLI technology develop Tel-Aviv University ) , DTI imaging ( image brain track ) . To , Sheba 's Medical Center , Tel Hashomer , join project responsible recruit patient Department Neurosurgery Department Rehabilitation also responsible perform needed test . The product develop end Magneton project expect unique analysis method allow examination monitoring affect brain functional anatomically-structural ultra-high resolution .</detailed_description>
