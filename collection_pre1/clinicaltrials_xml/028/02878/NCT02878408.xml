	<brief_summary>Immunology combine neurobiology offer prominent tool yield biomarkers , far miss psychiatry , design innovative treatment approach base discovery new molecular cellular target . As Bipolar Disorder Schizophrenia know significantly associate neuro-inflammation , project I-GIVE combine multidisciplinary approach ( clinical , viral , immunological , genetic ) explore global hypothesis place Human Endogenous Retro-Virus , HERV-W , crossroads susceptibility environmental factor ( winter-spring birth , infection , urbanicityâ€¦ ) genetic factor control immune response . Thus I-GIVE allow identification new biomarkers correlation clinical profile immuno-inflammatory/immuno-genetic marker , description patho-physiological mechanism psychiatric disorder . In addition , I-GIVE help design innovative treatment foster personalize psychiatry tailor needs patient . Notably , monoclonal antibody anti-HERV-W Env assess preclinical model ability slow , stop , even reverse progression psychosis patient . I-GIVE project thus lead major result strong impact scientific community , pharmaceutical industry , long term , improvement patient suffer Bipolar Disorder Schizophrenia family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator others able demonstrate HERV-W envelope gene ( Env ) encode pro-inflammatory neurotoxic protein reactivation environmental factor . In context , investigator report preliminary data show association Human Endogenous Retroviruses type `` W '' family ( HERV-W ) major psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder ( BD ) schizophrenia ( SZ ) : In 2008 , investigator report first time , presence ENV protein serum 50 % SZ patient associate chronic inflammatory status reflect elevated serum level C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) . The investigator able confirm find extend BD show elevation HERV-W RNA transcript BD SZ compare healthy control . Furthermore , investigator also observe first time toxoplasma Gondii , know able induce reactivation HERV-W , associate increase risk develop BD ( OR : 2.3 ) close one previously observe SZ ( OR= 2.17 ) The present project I-GIVE aim extend refine finding obtain proof concept involvement Human Endogenous Retrovirus elements bipolar disorder schizophrenia . I-GIVE divide four complementary scientific task : 1. assess systemic HERV-W ( ENV GAG ) antigen serum level RNA DNA copy number variant stabilize acutely ill patient , 2. measure systemic associate immuno-inflammatory cascade BD patient different stage disorder occurrence medical comorbidities , 3. identify clinical characteristic patient accord HERV-W expression immuno-inflammatory profile , 4. explore gene ( immuno-genetic ) x environment interaction may modulate immuno-inflammatory response Clinical biological data acute BP SZ patient compare first two different time . They compare also healthy control 's data , third stabilise BP SZ patient .</detailed_description>
