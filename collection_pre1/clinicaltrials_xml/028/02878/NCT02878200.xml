	<brief_summary>Reactive treatment household contact confirm malaria case show reduce infection prevalence since former increase risk infection . However , implement programmatic scale pose significant pressure health system may sustainable without active involvement recipient community . This study investigate novel approach reduce residual malaria transmission combine element active community involvement reactive treatment household contact clinical case report health facility . The investigator hypothesize area low transmission ( prevalence infection ≤10 % ) , asymptomatic carrier cluster around clinical malaria case household . Also , target individual share sleep area diagnose malaria case reduce parasite carriage community . This cluster-randomized trial village Central Upper Baddibu , North Bank East Region The Gambia , randomize receive either reactive treatment household contact follow confirmed case malaria standard care , i.e . treatment index case . Formative research community perception reaction self-administered treatment use generate , adapt evaluate message encourage adherence compliance treatment . This test first year implementation , finding use develop final model message implement second year study . The primary outcome prevalence malaria infection , determine molecular method , age group end second intervention year incidence clinical malaria transmission season .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Achieving malaria elimination present challenge important gap knowledge strategy tool need achieve . While malaria control measure aim reduce morbidity mortality vulnerable population , intervention reduce transmission design interrupt transmission malaria parasite human , especially asymptomatic parasite carrier [ 1 ] , mosquito . The importance asymptomatic infection transmission grown awareness majority human reservoir infection asymptomatic carrier [ 2 ] quite difficult target [ 3 ] . Previous malaria elimination campaign apply strategy mass drug administration : extensive treatment entire population , irrespective infection status , one multiple round [ 4 ] . Although transmission interrupt case , albeit temporarily [ 5 ] , reluctance apply method evidence impact mixed . A Cochrane systematic review MDAs show long term reduction possible within current concept highlight need study low- moderate-transmission setting study could address potential barrier community uptake , contribution development drug resistance [ 6 ] . More conservative approach involve screen infection rapid malaria diagnostic test ( RDT ) treat positive individual ; mass screening treatment , significant impact malaria incidence [ 7 ] , largely due low test 's sensitivity would miss large proportion infect individual low parasite density . Implementing reactive screening programmatic scale put significant pressure health system [ 8 ] available field-based screening test lack required sensitivity low-density parasitaemia see asymptomatic infection [ 9 ] . More importantly , understand local context adapt intervention strategy may help improve coverage participation recipient community [ 10 ] . This study investigate novel approach reduce residual malaria transmission combine element reactive treatment household contact clinical case report health facility active involvement patient household . The approach implementation develop formative research identifies optimum mean community engagement result best possible compliance adherence treatment household .</detailed_description>
