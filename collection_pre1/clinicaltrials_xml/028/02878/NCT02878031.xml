	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE This one-arm safety intervention study aim establish whether CHWs Nigeria safely manage chest indrawing pneumonia 2-59 month old child . The primary outcome proportion child five chest indrawing pneumonia manage appropriately Community Oriented Resources Persons ( CORPs ) clinical treatment failure day 6 . Secondary outcome include proportion child chest indrawing follow CORPs day 3 , clinical relapse pneumonia day 7 14 acceptability satisfaction outpatient management chest indrawing pneumonia . A total 308 child 2-59 month age chest indrawing pneumonia need safety intervention study . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Introduction Malaria Consortium ( MC ) intend implement WHO study , fund Rapid Access Expansion 2015 programme ( RAcE 2015 ) , community case management chest indrawing pneumonia oral amoxicillin child age 2-59 month old CORPs submit proposal Niger state , Nigeria . Study area Proposed study population Niger State , locate Nigeria 's North Central Zone , geographically large country 's state , cover 76,263 km2 . The state project population almost 5 million . Children five year make 21 % population , pregnant woman constitute 5 % . The population make Muslims , Christians small minority practise traditional belief . The majority population spread across rural area , 30 % population live urban area . Under WHO RAcE 2015 project MC work Federal Ministry Health ( FMoH ) strengthen iCCM programme six ( LGAs ) three zone Niger state : Paikoro ; Rafi ; Mariga ; Rijau ; Lapai ; Edati . The total population six LGAs 1,245,939 approximately 249,200 child age 2-59 month . Pneumonia remain leading cause 5 child mortality Nigeria , together India , contribute high absolute number pneumonia deaths world , 804,429 death child five year 2013 ( 2 ) . The expected incidence clinical pneumonia area Nigeria 0.28/child/year estimate 12 % progress severe disease . Objectives outcomes This one-arm safety intervention study aim establish whether CHWs Nigeria safely appropriately manage chest indrawing pneumonia 2-59 month old child . Primary outcomes proportion child five classify chest indrawing pneumonia manage appropriately Community Oriented Resources Persons ( CORPs ) clinical treatment failure chest indrawing pneumonia day 6 . Secondary outcome include : - Proportion child classify chest indrawing follow CORPs day 3 - Clinical relapse pneumonia day 7 14 among child whose sign pneumonia disappear day 6 - CORPs ' acceptability caregiver satisfaction outpatient management chest indrawing pneumonia Sample size sample Using sample size calculation prevalence survey finite population correction ; assumption proportion main indicator 50 % ( give conservative sample size ) ; confidence interval 95 % , total 196 child chest indrawing need estimate overall proportion child chest indrawing pneumonia experience treatment failure day 6 Â±7 % precision . Adjusting 10 % non-response rate caregiver , 10 % erroneous enrolment , cluster effect 1.3 case one child enrol one CORP , total sample size 308 child five chest indrawing require . With approximately 28,000 child 2-59 month old study area , assume 7,840 fast breathing case per year ( 0.28 episodes/child/year ) , 12 % chest indrawing incidence area would approximately 940 chest indrawing case per year . To enrol 308 child chest indrawing need study 12 month study period would need 203 CORPs LGA see approximately 30 % sick child community , believe highly feasible give experience iCCM programme uptake part Africa fact shall implement community mobilisation activity support engagement study . Case identification CORPs mainly passive case detection periodic community outreach activity . Based epidemiological data , period study data collection 12 month maximum , CORP anticipate enrol 1-2 child chest indrawing . CORPs assess child present house manage accord study protocol . All sick infant young 2 month refer reference facility . All child 2-59 month age chest indrawing danger sign consider eligible enrolment study consent obtain primary caregiver . CORPs register enrol case use SMS research assistant register enrol child ID , name , age , caregiver name , location , contact phone number . The enrolment information instantly forward SMS RA responsible CORP catchment area . The CORPs also able use smart phone video child 's chest movement time enrolment . These video review RA verify enrolment he/she visit child re-assessment . The RA visit household child soon possible child enrol late within 12 hour enrolment CORP. Before go child 's household , RA go CORP verify enrolment get detail child 's location . The CORP visit child three day enrolment ( day 3 ) ensure deterioration child 's condition necessary , refer child health facility symptom deteriorate . On day 6 15 enrolment , RAs together CORPs visit child enrol interview caregiver use mobile phone data collection form . Clinical relapse pneumonia determine base child 's clinical condition assess day 15 ( see table 4 detailed definition primary secondary outcome ) . If follow-up day , enrol child find home , CORP/RA follow caregiver find child , make every effort see child , even classify lose follow-up . Data collection , supervision outcome assessment DAY 1 : The CORPs ' performance establish re-assessment child research assistant ( RA ) visit household child soon possible child enrol late within 12 hour enrolment CORP . The RA use tablet sick child assessment tool walk RA question child , include current health status symptom present time care seek CORPs , treatment give CORP , treatment provide current illness episode . A handheld pulse oximeter use RAs detect symptom hypoxemia . If child find danger sign hypoxemia , illness treat CORP , RA facilitate referral near health facility exclude study . For child chest indrawings refer CORPs suspect presence danger sign , RA trace child referral facility ( home case referral refusal ) conduct re-assessment visit . Children find chest indrawing continue course antibiotic already prescribe . DAY 3 : Families enrol child encourage return CORPs 3 day enrolment reassessment CORP , standard iCCM . During visit , CORP reassess child , record finding ( include temperature presence/absence chest indrawing treatment , , receive child ) , inquire record caretaker provide amoxicillin tablet accord recommend treatment schedule , counsel mother administer next dos . If child bring back schedule visit day , CORP visit child home day 3 6 . If CORP determine condition enrol child deteriorate , s/he refer child reference facility call supervisor evaluation . Data standard set variable collect visit . The study supervisor verify visit make information collect review data uploads back-end server . DAYS 6-15 : On day 6 15 enrolment , RAs visit child enrol interview caregiver use mobile phone data collection form . Questions include current health status ( use IMCI algorithm ) , adherence treatment ( use pill count ) , care provider visit visit CORP , alternative treatment give ( CORP provide ) , hospitalisation . Clinical relapse pneumonia determine base child 's clinical condition assess day 15 . If enrolled child find home day 6 day 15 visit , RA follow phone call caregiver ensure loss-to follow-up . Following household visit day 6 15 , selection 25 CORPs 25 child caregiver ask participate unstructured interview document CORPs ' acceptability caregiver satisfaction outpatient management chest indrawing pneumonia . The study coordinator visit treatment failure ( secondary outcome ) reassessment child . Monitoring evaluation , include summary data analysis plan A system regular monitoring introduce ensure study activity implement per plan , use approve operating procedure . CORP service statistic patient see referral make captured CORPs paper-based report . This data compile data manager , interpret study coordinator share program manager regular basis . The data manager regularly review data submission enrol child , include checklist submit RAs Day 0-1 , 6 15 , well follow-up form submit CORPs day 3 . These submission check completeness accuracy anonymised assign enrol child unique study number use number store case data project database . While data collection form inbuilt consistency range check , additional discrepancy identify raised supervision visit . An automatically generated report contain information child enrol , child follow child die , clinical treatment failure clinical relapse pneumonia generate review monthly basis make available PIs , co-investigators donor .</detailed_description>
