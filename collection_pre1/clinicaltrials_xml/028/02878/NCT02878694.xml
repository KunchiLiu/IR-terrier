	<detailed_description>Muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal ( OPMD ) autosomal dominant inherit myopathy manifest selective involvement levator muscle upper eyelid , head ptosis , muscle intersection pharyngolaryngeal originally disorder swallow . Ptosis treat surgery ( shorten levator muscle ) , disease continue evolve , relapse occur , necessitate another intervention , suspension eyelid frontal muscle cause corneal complication imperfect lid closure . Main objective restore muscle function levator muscle upper eyelid provide registry autologous myoblasts non- clinically affected muscle . A study model conduct patient ENT OPMD crossroads muscle encourage result , 12/12 patient improve quality life degradation swallow observe 10 / 12 patient . This interventional study , multicenter , comparative , one eye receive cell contralateral eye negative control . If effectiveness follow review primary endpoint advice independent expert committee , experimental treatment offer patient contralateral eyelid . Seven center associate project inclusion assessment center . Patients refer different clinical site Caen ophthalmology department perform pre-transplant assessment , collection donor myoblast muscle graft part track . The expected duration 3 year ( 2 year inclusion evaluation primary endpoint 1 year ) inclusion 10 patient . The safety autologous myoblast transplantation show several direction promise efficacy result . They produce unit Biotherapy Rouen University Hospital ( Prof. O. Boyer ) , currently lead test cell ( ClinicalTrials.gov , myoblast Anal Incontinence ( MIAS ) , NCT01523522 , 24 patient provide Protocol include July 2014 , 6 month follow last patient expect January 2015 ) authorize production advance therapy medicinal product prepare punctually ( ANSM ) . In study , different successive step : - Step include : patient age 18 75 , verification diagnosis disease , evaluation balance ptosis ( measurement , photograph , film ) , obtain consent , - Muscle biopsy healthy muscle cell amplification , outpatient basis , local anesthesia , 3 4 week transplantation , - Transplant myoblasts multiple intramuscular injection ( 6 ) , local anesthesia . Longitudinal microscarifications make superficially injected muscle stimulate muscle regeneration . Intramuscular injection myoblasts levator muscle upper lid 6 equidistant point , injection contain 5 million cell . These injection make muscle mass area 5 cm2 , range 6 20 mm tarsus thick muscle area . It intend inject eye treat randomize total 30 million myoblasts . This protocol base one use correction ENT disorder within several PHRC responsibility Professor Sophie Périé . The dos use myoblast transplantation pharyngeal constrictor muscle adapt levator muscle eyelid . - Follow-up visit 3 year patient : - The first year , evaluation primary endpoint visit 8 day month , every 3 month - Out protocol 3 year administration cell every 6 month ( monitor carry part standard care ) . These visit evaluate effectiveness transplant different objective measurement eye ( eyelid opening slot gaze straight ahead ; levator muscle strength upper eyelid , visual benefit : measurement visual acuity measurement visual field ) , profit neck pain . The tour include side effect detection examination ( local inflammatory phenomenon , palpable lump ) . In end , landmark trial new F.H.U . SURFACE deal regenerative medicine head neck , investigator expect improvement quality levator upper eyelid muscle deficient correction ptosis patient .</detailed_description>
