	<brief_summary>The invesitgators utilize Cerner HealthFacts database ( large HIPAA-compliant clinical-administrative database maintain Cerner Inc. , USA ) identify cohort 6,249 adult underwent on-pump cardiac surgery valve and/or coronary artery procedure January 2001 March 2013 . Of , investigator select 1136 patient receive 5 % albumin day day follow cardiac surgery match ( 1:1 ) 1136 patient receive albumin . Characteristics patient match included patient demographic , hospital procedural characteristic , baseline patient comorbidities include preoperative CKD 26 group condition , well acute severity illness admission ICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following development study plan project summary , approval obtain ( November 25th 2013 ) Duke University Medical Center institutional review board , review study outline , include endpoint treatment exposure group prior data extraction . HIPAA-compliant data extract U.S. Cerner HealthFactsÂ® , ( Cerner Corp. , Kansas City , MO ) database . Patients underwent cardiac surgery utilize CPB Jan 2001 March 2013 identify . In addition hospital characteristic ( bed-size , teach status , location ) , encounter-level patient data ( demographic , admission source , payer ) , comprehensive time-stamped medication order , pharmacy record , laboratory result , admission discharge diagnose ( International Classification Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification , ICD-9-CM code ) procedures available . Study Population Adults underwent isolate valve , isolate CABG two procedure utilize CPB , survive at-least 24 hour eligible inclusion ( except CABG perform emergently follow PCI ) . Procedures identify use ICD-9-CM code ( 39.61 = extracorporeal circulation auxiliary open heart surgery ) CPT code ( indicate 'on-pump ' surgery ) . Patients miss incomplete admission , procedure , and/or discharge date , gender , age exclude . Discrete encounter less four hour apart within hospital system , consider contiguous . We also exclude patient undergoing heart transplantation ( ICD-9 procedure code 37.51 ) follow Elixhauser comorbidities : AIDS , lymphoma , metastatic cancer , solid tumor without metastasis . Only first operative procedure time consider patient undergo multiple non-contiguous procedure exclude . Definition Exposure The study cohort consist patient either receive least 500mL crystalloid ( 0.9 % saline , buffer salt solution Plasma-Lyte , Lactated Ringers etc . ) without volume 5 % albumin - 'albumin ' 'crystalloid ' cohort respectively . All intravenous fluid document day day follow surgery consider order determine eligibility inclusion , fluid volume day two day follow surgery monitor . The investigator exclude crystalloids administer small container ( &lt; =250mL volume ) likely use medication delivery rather maintenance hydration expansion intravascular blood volume adult population . Such volume threshold impose colloid 'albumin ' cohort however . Patients exclude study receive colloid ( e.g . albumin 5 % concentration hydroxyethyl starch ) hypertonic saline . Patients exclude albumin arm receive plasma protein fraction ( PPF ) however . Definition Outcomes The primary outcome in-hospital mortality index admission cardiac surgery perform . The investigator also examine in-hospital mortality within 30 , 60 , 90 day index procedure . Secondary endpoint include major postoperative adverse cardiac , renal , hepatic , metabolic , pulmonary , neurologic , hematologic , infectious event define use clinical parameter administrative code ( ICD-9-CM ) . Additional administrative secondary outcome include : Length-of-stay , readmission , re-operations ( return operate room ) . MACE 30 , 60 90 day calculate four separate binary category : 1 ) in-hospital mortality ; 2 ) post-operative stroke cerebrovascular accident per ICD-9 diagnosis code present-on-admission index visit subsequent visit within respective MACE timeframes ; 3 ) post-operative revascularization PCI ; 4 ) post-operative myocardial infarction . A composite binary indicator also report one great MACE condition meet within respective timeframes .</detailed_description>
