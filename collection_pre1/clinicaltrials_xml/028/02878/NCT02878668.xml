	<brief_title>The Value Infectious Biomarkers Prediction Complication After Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative complication major abdominal surgery , pancreatic surgery hilar cholangiocarcinoma surgery , high , 30 50 % .It mainly reason patient admit ICU . Among , common difficult handle complication mainly anastomotic fistula , abdominal effusion subsequent secondary infection . Delayed diagnosis cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , multiple organ failure ( MODS ) , even death . From surgical point view , lead surgical failure often need second surgery . However , diagnosis treatment postoperative infection also face two problem : difficult confirm diagnosis make treatment decision . Hence , strong need additional tool early diagnose post operative complication . Serum procalcitonin ( PCT ) , 116 amino-acids protein produce C-cells thyroid gland . PCT baseline level low ( &lt; 0.05 ng/ml ) , increase significantly patient severe bacterial infection . Therefore , PCT level use monitor course prognosis systemic bacterial infection tailor therapeutic intervention efficiently . Furthermore , PCT could serve early predictive marker clinical course septic complication abdominal surgery . The aim study demonstrate PCT sensible , specific reliable biomarker post operative complication biomarkers The investigator conduct observational , prospective study . All patient undergo electively hepatopancreatobiliary surgery seven centre recruit . In case white blood count ( WBC ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) PCT level measure 1st , 3rd 5th postoperative day ( POD ) . Informed consent obtain patients.The study approve hospital 's Ethical Committee .</detailed_description>
