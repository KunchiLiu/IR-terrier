	<brief_summary>1 . To compare therapeutic effect , safety correspond pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics two different method drug administration : 10mg , daily 30mg/d , twice every week , find effect way Chidamide administration . 2 . To examine whether Chidamide could activate EB virus , whether two different way administration different EB virus activation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differences Between Chidamide Taken Daily Twice Week Therapeutic Effect，Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics EB Virus Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , Chidamide take twice week , come cell experiment phase I clinical trial , show de-acetylation effect Chidamide could last 72 hour administration . However , daily administration Chidamide may create steady Chidamide concentration , thus improve de-acetylation effect Chidamide , 's necessary compare two different way administration . Current study show Romidepsin , HDACI , could activate EBV treatment NKTCL , whether Chidamide , novel HDACI , could activate EBV still clear , problem worth access .</detailed_description>
