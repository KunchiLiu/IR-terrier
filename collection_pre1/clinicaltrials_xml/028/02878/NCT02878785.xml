	<brief_summary>The purpose study find best way combine new chemotherapy drug one already use treat AML . The new experimental drug call talazoparib ( also know BMN-673 ) , approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The FDA allow use talazoparib purpose study . Decitabine use treat bone marrow diseases call myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , well label AML . Lab work suggest talazoparib increase effect decitabine leukemia cell . Investigators hope treat patient decitabine talazoparib together successful treat patient decitabine alone . This study two part . The purpose part one study find best dos decitabine talazoparib use give together treat AML . The purpose part two see well drug work together treat AML . All participant study treat decitabine talazoparib . Part one study include two people many 36 people find best dose level study drug . Part one begin enrol first . Part two study start Part one study complete . Participants tell part study may enrol . Part two study may include 79 people many 135 people . Part two include three separate arm . Participants enrol Part two study , assign one three arm order test success rate study drug dose determine Part one : - Arm A enroll adult patient AML think likely tolerate respond standard chemotherapy ; - Arm B enroll adult patient AML respond previous treatment come back respond previous treatment ; - Arm C enroll adult patient previously treat DNA methyltransferase inhibitor ( decitabine , azacitidine guadecitabine ) . This multi-center study . Up 171 people may take part study globally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Talazoparib Untreated AML R/R AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical trial , invvestigators combine decitabine talazoparib treatment patient AML . Decitabine give establish regimen IV daily dose 5 day every 28 day . Talazoparib initiate orally daily continuous basis , begin Day 1 Course 1 . In phase 1 trial , decitabine talazoparib test 3 4 dose level , respectively , yield 6 combination . Doses escalate base tolerability use 'classic ' 3+3 design . Once MTD decitabine combine 0.25 mg talazoparib establish , dose talazoparib escalate dose decitabine keep fixed provisional MTD dose . There step drug combination . The regimen phase 2 test chosen base tolerability , also base available pharmacodynamic efficacy data . In phase 2 , select combination regimen study efficacy . Each patient treat occurrence either unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy perform approximately day 28 treatment course unless circulate blast persist peripheral blood , documentation CR CRi . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy repeat time clinical concern disease progression . In Phase 1 , clinical trial enroll patient relapse refractory AML order test novel combination initially patient less favorable outcome decitabine alone . This do avoid possibility compromise outcome untreated patient , 40 % response rate 5-day decitabine single agent , unlikely possibility combination inferior . The regimen also test previously untreated AML patient unfit chemotherapy phase 2 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis AML base 2008 WHO criteria . AML may de novo , follow prior hematologic disorder , include MDS Philadelphia chromosomenegative myeloproliferative neoplasm , and/or therapyrelated . 2 . PHASES 1 AND 2 : Patients AML relapse , refractory , firstline therapy , without subsequent additional therapy , currently consider unfit , unlikely respond , cytotoxic chemotherapy . 3 . PHASE 2 ONLY : Patients previously untreated AML consider unfit cytotoxic chemotherapy virtue performance status , comorbidities , advanced age and/or low likelihood response base disease characteristic , decline cytotoxic induction chemotherapy . 4 . Patients undergone autologous stem cell transplantation ( autoSCT ) eligible provide ≥ 4 week stem cell infusion . 5 . Patients undergone allogeneic SCT ( alloSCT ) eligible ≥ 60 day stem cell infusion , evidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) &gt; Grade 1 , ≥ 2 week immunosuppressive therapy . 6 . Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy must complete least 3 week radiotherapy least 2 week prior Day 1 treatment study , adverse event ( exclude alopecia ) due agent administer 4 week earlier recover &lt; Grade 1 . Patients hematologic malignancy expect hematologic abnormality study entry . Hematologic abnormality think primarily relate leukemia consider toxicity ( AE ) need resolve &lt; Grade 1 . 7 . Prior DNA methyl transferase inhibitor administration ( azacitidine , decitabine , guadecitabine ) AML antecedent MDS allow clinical trial consider best treatment option , azacitidine , decitabine , guadecitabine must stop least 3 week prior Day 1 treatment study . 8 . All biologic agent include hematopoietic growth factor must stop least 1 week prior Day 1 treatment study . 9 . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use decitabine talazoparib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . 10 . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) . 11 . Life expectancy great 2 month . 12 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit unless think due hemolysis Gilbert 's syndrome ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ; Creatinine within normal institutional limit ; OR • Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . 13 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test , female patient childbearing potential male patient must agree use adequate contraception . Decitabine assign pregnancy category D FDA . Pregnant woman must take decitabine female subject must immediately stop take decitabine inform doctor become pregnant treatment . Decitabine expect result adverse reproductive effect cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman . In preclinical study mice rat , decitabine teratogenic , fetotoxic , embryotoxic . Studies pregnant animal evaluate effect talazoparib pregnancy perform . Because decitabine know teratogenic effect talazoparib develop human fetus unknown , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion decitabine talazoparib administration . It know whether decitabine excrete human milk . Similarly , study lactate animal evaluate effect talazoparib perform , thus , know whether talazoparib excrete human milk . Therefore , breastfeed stop decitabine talazoparib treatment . 14 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients acute promyelocytic leukemia . 2 . Patients active central nervous system leukemia require maintenance intrathecal chemotherapy . 3 . Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy AML . 4 . Patients receive investigational agent . 5 . Hyperleukocytosis &gt; 50,000 blasts/μl . Hydroxyurea blast count control permit start treatment , must stop prior start treatment study . Patients withdraw study &gt; 50,000 blasts/μl occur recur &gt; 14 day start treatment study . 6 . Active , uncontrolled infection . Patients infection control antibiotic eligible . 7 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation per investigator 's judgment would limit compliance study requirement . 8 . Patients pregnant nursing . 9 . Patients chemotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) radiotherapy within 2 week antecedent malignancy prior enter study , recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 10 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition decitabine talazoparib . 11 . Known HIV infection . HIVpositive patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 12 . Previous treatment talazoparib .</criteria>
