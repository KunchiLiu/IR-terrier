	<detailed_description>Background : Difference autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) process across cultural ethnic group suggest autonomic regulation differentiation may occur even early age . However , role ethnicity environment regulation response towards sensory stimulation child well understood yet . This research aim compare autonomic activity rest condition toward block auditory stimulation typically develop child different country live environment examine role environment ethnicity autonomic regulation . Methods : Four group typically-developing participant recruit study : 1 ) Chinese child live Hong Kong ( n=32 ) ; Filipino child live Hong Kong ( 32 ) ; Filipino child live urban-Philippines ( n=32 ) ; Filipino child live urban-Philippines ( n=32 ) . Participants male ( nm=16 ) female ( nf=16 ) , age 7-12 year old , without know history developmental disability , medical history cardiac pulmonary problem , medical history diabetes , sensory deficit . Recruited participant watch silent movie , listen block sound stimulus presentation . Autonomic activity ( heart rate variability electrodermal activity ) measure record use Polar H2 heart rate monitor eSense GSR . Recordings screen ectopic beat HRV burst EDA . The HRV EDA signal process use aHRV Ledalab software , respectively , accord standard edit analyse HRV EDA artefact . Autonomic activity ( LF , HF EDA ) experimental condition group ( HK group PH-U group ; Fil-HK group PH-U group ; PH-U group vs. PH-R group ) test repeated measure MANOVA . All significant level set critical α= &gt; .05 . Discussion : This study increase understand role culture environment regulation behaviour auditory processing . The finding research may shed light evaluation treatment plan child across within culture .</detailed_description>
