	<brief_title>Wristbot : A Novel Device Assessment Proprioceptive Deficits After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The WristBot constitutes comprehensive , integrate robotic system early diagnosis rehabilitation sensory fine motor dysfunction neurological orthopedic disease . It validate three clinical trial , include orthopaedic patient , Parkinsons disease 9 chronic stroke patient . Its unique feature use adaptive , progressive robot-aided therapy achieve intensive , task specific wrist movement . In context propose project target stroke population . Integration refer system 's ability perform assessment proprioceptive status proprioceptive training single device . The scope current project investigate efficacy proprioceptive assessment WristBot correlating result throughout rehabilitation protocol . The propose technology comprise hardware device four motor apply torque human wrist three degree freedom ( i.e . axes rotation : wrist flexion/extension , abduction/adduction forearm pronation/supination ) . This allow guide controlled movement wrist deliver assistive , resistive , perturbation force ( patient actively move wrist ) . It contain set specialized software module ) allow objective , psychophysical assessment sensory dysfunction patient , b ) provide specialized training module design improve sensory motor function wrist .</detailed_description>
