	<brief_summary>Diagnosis intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( iCCA ) increasingly common patient liver cirrhosis , patient deny liver transplantation ( LT ) centre due historically poor result . Two retrospective evaluation show 5 year survival ~65 % select patient iCCA diagnosis pathology explanted liver . This suggest LT curative treatment apply selectively . This study evaluate effectiveness LT treatment early iCCA diagnose cirrhotic patient meet strict selection criterion . Patients advanced cirrhosis ( candidate resection ) currently curative treatment option . Participants allow bridge therapy prior receive transplant . Participants follow 5 year time transplant patient survival disease recurrence outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diagnosis intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( iCCA ) increasingly common patient liver cirrhosis . iCCA indication Liver transplantation ( LT ) transplant centre give historically poor rate survival high rate disease recurrence . A recent retrospective study show patient find early iCCA explant undergo LT another indication , 5 year survival 65 % recurrence rate 13 % .This suggest LT curative treatment apply selectively time reevaluate LT treatment option early iCCA . This study evaluate effectiveness LT treatment early iCCA diagnose cirrhotic patient . Diagnosis iCCA base upon biopsy result new tumor present radiologically HCC . Patients fulfil strict study selection criterion undergo full transplant assessment must deem otherwise `` suitable '' liver transplant per centre 's criterion . Patients treat bridge therapy transplant wait list accord center 's policy . Patients disease progression ( tumor &gt; 3cm development extrahepatic disease ) time prior transplantation exclude . Participants follow 5 year time transplant patient survival disease recurrence outcome measure .</detailed_description>
