	<brief_summary>The purpose present study investigate association accumulation advance glycation end-products ( AGE ) adverse outcome ( e.g . death ) people receive haemodialysis peritoneal dialysis base Royal Derby Hospital , well impact dietetic intervention AGE accumulation . AGE measure non-invasively skin use technique call skin autofluorescence ( SAF ) . The present study conduct two part : Study 1 : prospective study participant followed-up five year . The research team measure accumulation AGE skin use quick ( less five minute ) painless technique call SAF . This involve place forearm piece equipment shine light skin measure amount light reflect back . Participants ask complete nutritional quality life questionnaire , measurement weight , height , arm circumference skinfold thickness ( i.e . anthropometry ) , simple eyesight test blood test . Study 2 : participant randomly assign either low AGE diet ( intervention group ) standard diet people dialysis ( control group ) . Participants followed-up 2 year receive precise oral write instruction comply diet . Blood eyesight test , SAF measurement , anthropometry nutritional quality life assessment conduct . In Studies 1 2 , approximately two teaspoon blood collect measure AGE level additional blood test help u investigate effect AGEs body . If participant agree , investigator also store blood future research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY BACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) global public health problem associate multiple adverse outcome include reduced survival , especially people require renal replacement therapy ( peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) , haemodialysis [ HD ] transplantation ) . Multiple risk factor lead development and/or progression CKD , obesity , hyperlipidaemia , glomerulonephritis , intercurrent infection , smoking , type 2 diabetes hypertension , two latter consider leading cause CKD worldwide . People dialysis develop variety complications/abnormalities result loss endocrine exocrine function kidney , include anaemia , metabolic acidosis , bone mineral disorder , fluid overload , hypertension , electrolyte disturbance dyslipidaemia . In recent year , inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction ( common abnormality people dialysis ) become area interest strong relationship high rate cardiovascular morbidity mortality people dialysis . Advanced glycation end-products ( AGE ) uremic toxin markedly increase people dialysis . Formation AGE start non-enzymatic reaction protein glucose molecule call Maillard reaction ; however , AGE also form rapidly oxidative stress subsequent formation reactive carbonyl compound like methyl glyoxal . At point , AGE synthesis irreversible AGE cross-link tissue proteins ; seem collagen skin vascular basement membrane especially susceptible AGE accumulation subsequent injury . AGE also interact specific AGE receptor lead activation systemic inflammation increase release cytokine , consequently , exacerbate tissue damage . Importantly , AGE also form food cooking dry heat high temperature fry , grill roast 10 % ingested AGE absorb . Skin autofluorescence ( SAF ) relatively new technique measure skin accumulation AGE . It non-invasive , operator independent , quick ( less 5 minute ) easy perform technique utilizes fluorescent property AGE , like extensively use collagen link fluorescence ( CLF ) method , validate specific AGE measurement CLF skin biopsy . It report SAF strongly correlate overall cardiovascular mortality people diabetes undergoing HD . Several factor associate high SAF value people dialysis cross-sectional study , instance , chronological age dialysis modality , glucose exposure peritoneal dialysis fluid dialysis vintage people PD presence diabetes people HD . AGE accumulation postulate one modulating factor drive visual disorder ; increase accumulation secondary hyperglycaemia diabetes think cause vascular basement membrane thicken destruction pericytes retinal capillary bed diabetic retinopathy . The accumulation AGE also report mechanism deterioration visual acuity associate increase age . Separately , accumulation AGE metabolic disease ( e.g . end stage kidney disease [ ESKD ] ) find cause nerve eye dysfunction . Ocular abnormality therefore visual disturbance report people ESKD mechanism fully explore understood . In animal study , AGE accumulation see lens , cornea vitreous humour . In human , systemic AGE level visual acuity score previously investigate . Because adverse outcome strongly associate high level SAF , several option focus reduce accumulation AGE propose . One promising intervention reduction dietary AGE ; suggest cook technique avoid high temperature poach , steam , stew boil significantly reduce AGE content food compare frying , broiling , grill roasting ; nevertheless , evidence regard dietary modification reduce exogenous AGE low quality therefore study require . The result present project benefit people dialysis may demonstrate reduction dietary AGE intake decrease SAF level population . Published observational study suggest reduction SAF level turn associate reduction high morbidity mortality rate associate chronic dialysis , consequently , healthcare cost . Improved survival reduce comorbidity would also expect improve quality life people dialysis . Because intervention depend change cook method , likely applied people dialysis additional cost . DURATION OF THE STUDY Study 1 : Participant recruitment begin August 2016 anticipated recruitment period 6 month . Therefore , baseline data measurement collect perform August 2016 February 2017 . Once recruit , participant followed-up five year ; consequently , expect study complete February 2022 . Study 2 : Participant recruitment begin December 2017 anticipate recruitment period 3 month . Therefore , baseline data measurement collect performed December 2017 February 2018 . Once recruit , participant followed-up 24 month ; consequently , expect clinical trial complete February 2020 . RECRUITMENT Potential participant HD PD recruit Renal Unit Department Nephrology Royal Derby Hospital . The initial detail study participant information sheet provide usual care team ( may include researcher ) . Participants give least 24 hour consider whether wish participate , well ask question study , re-contacted investigator . INFORMED CONSENT The process obtain participant inform consent accordance Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) guidance , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) regulatory requirement might introduce . All participant provide write informed consent . The Informed Consent Form sign date participant enter study . The Investigator explain detail study provide Participant Information Sheet , ensure participant sufficient time consider participate . The Investigator answer question participant concern study participation . STATISTICS To compare baseline versus final evaluation , Wilcoxon test pair t-test used case dimensional variable , McNemar test case categorical variable . Intergroup comparison perform use Mann Whitney test Student test continuous variable Ï‡2 test Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . To determine significance strength association , Pearson 's correlation coefficient use analysis association continuous variable Spearman rank nonparametric variable . Linear regression analysis use identify determinant AGE accumulation . Cox proportional hazard model use investigate prognostic value accumulation AGE predict mortality . A p-value le equal 0.05 consider statistical significance . Sample size calculation Study 1 2 perform use software nQuery Advisor v.6.0 . Sample size Study 1 : The primary outcome study association increase SAF level mortality people HD PD . With power 80 % , two-sided alpha 5 % expect hazard ratio 3.5 2.0 people PD HD , respectively , 100 HD 40 PD participant need . Sample size Study 2 : The primary outcome intervention effect low AGE diet SAF level . For two-sided alpha level 0.05 mean difference 0.632 AU dietetic intervention , sample 41 dialysis participant ( either HD PD ) assign low AGE diet group give power 80 % . A 1:1 randomization scheme use ; therefore , sample size 41 dialysis participant low AGE diet group 41 dialysis participant control group ( standard diet ) . ETHICS COMMITTEE AND REGULATORY APPROVALS The study initiate protocol , informed consent form participant information sheet receive approval / favourable opinion REC , respective NHS Research &amp; Development ( R &amp; D ) department . PROCEDURES FOR MISSING DATA AND ADVERSE EVENTS All SAF measurement , biochemistry , nutritional quality life assessment Study 1 2 used statistical analysis , include data participant complete entire study protocol .
