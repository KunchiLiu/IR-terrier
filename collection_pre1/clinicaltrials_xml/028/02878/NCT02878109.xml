	<detailed_description>Background : Liver cancer second lead cause cancer death worldwide . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) typically present arterial phase hyperenhancement . For intermediate stage disease majority patient eligible curative therapy , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) consider first-line palliative treatment eligible patient . Despite efficacy HCC , TACE present major challenge lack quantitative biomarkers treatment response . Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) enable quantitative assessment tumor tissue enhancement , acquire MR signal intensity function time . Objectives : This study conduct develop monitoring system base quantifiable measure intra-arterial treatment dynamic MRI , use time-activity curve analyze use dual-input dual-compartment model . Design : This prospective study HCC patient undergo TACE accord clinical standard care . A 4D-THRIVE sequence perform . Single intensity before/after gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement use create time-concentration curve , fit simple perfusion model account dual blood supply liver hepatic artery portal vein . Perfusion parameter arterial hepatic blood flow , portal venous hepatic blood flow , total hepatic blood flow arterial fraction extract model compare HCC surround cirrhotic liver . When deemed necessary , CBCT acquire chemo-embolization way see appropriate artery select treatment . The CBCT use available determine parameter blood flow obtain model . Methods : Thirty patient select . A 4D-THRIVE sequence acquire within 2 week prior TACE 6 8 week TACE . A 4D-FLOW MRI sequence also include . Expected result : The result study provide quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers identification viable tumor tumor response . In addition , presence increase % arterial flow decrease portal venous flow HCC use DCE-MRI expect help assess treatment response .</detailed_description>
