	<brief_summary>Breast screening service offer NHS help detect breast cancer precancerous change early time treatment likely curative . An effective service must reach 'at risk ' asymptomatic population . Breast screen uptake London , consistently fall national target well national average . Uptake West London particularly low , boroughs Inner North West London low uptake rate country . Routine text message reminder proven effective improve uptake breast screening appointment . However little attention pay content message . Previous study text message reminder clinical area show content message matter text message effective others . This protocol describe design randomize controlled trial investigate effect differently word text message engagement breast screen West London . Two intervention arm design take consideration result 1000 woman survey highlight behavioural barrier predict attendance .

To end , randomise control trial ( RCT ) test current standard practice text message reminder two intervention text message trial arm inform described survey . The set West London Breast Screening Service woman age 47-73 due screen randomized receive one three trial arm . The primary outcome difference uptake trial arm .

	<detailed_description>Background In UK breast cancer common female cancer affect 1 8 woman , account 31 % cancer 15 % cancer death women.1 The NHS breast screen programme ( NHSBSP ) offer 3-yearly screen woman age 50-70 year . A pilot extend screening age 47-73 trialed geographical area . In 2015 , 75 % woman England attend breast screening . In year 68.3 % woman London 65.9 % West London respectively up-to-day mammogram previous 3 year . 2 This fall national average target uptake 70 % . The success screen programme relies sensitivity screen tool availability successful treatment also reach asymptomatic risk population . Recent evidence breast screen show simple text message reminder ( TMR ) effective . 3,4 . One randomize control trial show increase attendance much 12 % .5 As result TMRs use frequently NHS organisation , little consideration pay word content . Further research test word content TMR remind patient routine outpatient hospital appointment show word choice matter . The effective message reduce 'did attend ' rate 3.4 percentage point compare control TMR London Hospital . 6 Objective This study aim test word content TMRs affect uptake breast screening . Trial design The investigator propose collaborate West London Breast Screening Service ( WoLBSS ) test different TMRs RCT increase screen uptake . The trial test effect differently word TMRs uptake breast screen eligible woman West London . This three-armed RCT test two intervention arm current control arm . Current practice woman receive two TMRs 7 4 day prior appointment . Therefore current message maintain control message TMR 1 ( 7 day prior appointment ) TMR 2 ( 4 day prior appointment ) . The intervention arm contain intervention TMRs send TMR1 TMR2 . During trial period woman due screen randomized receive one three trial arm ( control , intervention arm 1 intervention arm 2 . The TMRs send 7 day 4 day breast screen appointment trial period currently send part routine practice . Women receive message 7th day 4th day appointment . WoLBSS inform research team woman 's attendance status end screen round . Methods : Study set This study run West London collaboration WoLBSS , currently provide routine TMR service base data previous trial.5 The research team work closely WoLBSS team run RCT exist infrastructure use send current message . Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria Women eligible due breast screen West London . Exclusion Criteria Women eligible breast screening due example bilateral mastectomy . Women choose screen inform screen centre GP . Withdrawal Criteria Any woman chooses take part screen receive TMR inform screen centre GP . Interventions The RCT three arm . 1. control ( current TMR ) 2 . Intervention 1 - Behavioural regulation TMR 3 . Intervention 2 - Priority TMR The choice content intervention text message base survey 1000 woman run research team evaluate 15 behavioural construct predict outcome measure woman 's history attendance intention attend . Two strong construct predict history attendance intention attend 'behavioural regulation ' i.e . make plan/note diary attend breast screen 'priority ' i.e . much woman feel screen priority . Therefore word content two TMRs construct take account . Both intervention TMRs review approve WoLBSS routine care team well clinical lead screen Public Health Consultant Cancer screen NHS England . Control - ( current TMR ) 'Do n't forget breast screen appointment ( time ) ( date ) ( Site ) . Please call 02033136644 rearrange cancel ' Intervention arm 1 - Behavioural Regulation 'Do n't forget make diary note screen mammogram appt ( time ) ( date ) ( site ) . Call 02033136644 rearrange . ' Intervention arm 2 - Priority 'Is breast screening appointment priority list ? Apt ( time ) , ( date ) ( site ) . Call 02033136644 rearrange . ' Outcomes The primary end point rate uptake screen end screening round . Trial arm power sample size collect detect 3 % uptake screening . The trial close sample size reach . The secondary outcome uptake accord age , deprivation score previous history attendance . Participant Timeline Women routinely invite screen mammogram per standard procedure approximately three week appointment . The research team randomise anonymized list woman receive one three TMRs . The TMR send time current standard TMRs send 7 4 day prior appointment . Sample Size The sample size calculate detect 3 % difference uptake group 5 % margin type I 20 % margin type II error . This expected improvement uptake deem realistic operationally significant service . The uptake West London 2015 65.9 % . The investigator therefore calculate minimum sample size trial arm 3,832 total sample size 11,496 . Recruitment For screen round WoLBSS invite woman breast screen per usual . It possible identify time randomization woman provide WoLBSS phone number . For reason woman due screen randomise . However , woman give mobile phone number able receive TMR . Randomisation Each screen round list woman forward iPlato Patient Care Messaging allocate appointment date , time location . The participant list randomise iPlato trial arm allocate receive one three TMRs use Mersenne Twister algorithm . Once randomised list woman due screen uploaded iPlato platform . The iPlato system link patient NHS number WoLBSS record retrieve mobile phone number one available . WoLBSS use iPlato Patient Care Messaging currently send exist text message reminder . iPlato communication platform develop specifically health service send reminder message behalf GPs hospital . Data collection management Data collect WoLBSS IT system include primary research outcome attendance status . iPlato collect data accuracy phone number message delivery status . Anonymised data retrieve pass onto research team . The data handle NHS N3 computer password protection , research team 's personal laptop secure password protection Imperial College London 's secure virtual private network . Any transmission data via email within secure NHS.net NHS trust email account WoLBSS research team within secure Imperial College email account virtual private network amongst research team . Data collect include age , year birth , first 3-4 digit postcode , ethnicity , previous attendance history availability mobile phone number . It possible participant subject trial however due nature trial appropriate contact patient find . It necessary term impact result . Consent The premise study whether subtle change text message increase number patient attend breast screening appointment . A pre-warning patient may receive TMR may modify would undermine premise study affect result . This participation bias , would indicate subject know participate trial likely try think researcher want . Taking explicit consent would therefore also undermine study design . Only woman give mobile phone number WoLBSS directly , able receive TMR prior appointment . Therefore past give explicit consent receive TMR service . No woman previously give mobile number service receive TMR .</detailed_description>
