	<brief_summary>The main objective study estimate intrinsic diagnostic quality digital dPCR screen T21 multicentrique sample patient pregnancy high risk T21 ( risk &gt; 1/250 ) . The profit expect technique propose encircled woman screen successful screening combine ( organize ) 1st quarter , simple realization moderate cost . We thus propose original alternative ( alternate ) method exclusive , expensive binding technique top-debit ( -flow ) . The recent technical improvement ( , ) advantage medical - economic allow envisage reliable , strong long-lasting use dPCR clinical routine DPNI T21 laboratory . This pilot project could serve later development study clinical validation multicentrique large scale ( big turntable ladder ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Accuracy Noninvasive Screening PCR Digital Down Syndrom</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context Currently , non-invasive screen test trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) propose every pregnant woman . This first trimester combine test consist ultrasound nuchal translucency measurement , associate different maternal serum biochemical assay maternal age . Since discovery presence cell-free fetal DNA maternal plasma , noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) , use mainly massive parallel sequencing ( MPS ) approach , introduce . The chromosomal origin sequence plasma DNA molecule over- under-representation chromosome identify MPS maternal plasma . The specificity sensibility high-throughput technique excellent , close 100 % . However , MPS remain time-consuming , expensive ( &gt; 1000 euro per patient ) ca n't use clinical routine genetics laboratory worldwide . Digital PCR represent interesting alternative MPS due target approach , cost ( &gt; 10x less MPS ) , speed relative simplicity allow clinical routine practice . However , clinical analytical relevance remain insufficiently demonstrate literature data . Therefore , main objective evaluate diagnosis accuracy noninvasive screening PCR digital Down syndrome . Expected result This study assess sensitivity , specificity likelihood ratio satisfactory accuracy . The call rate also evaluate consider positive test . The optimal number replicates ( lead false positive rate &lt; 5 % ) determine use ROC curve . Our hypothesis sensitivity screen test upper 95 % false positive rate &lt; 5 % . If result conclusive , pilot project strong argument favor development large scale study . It may challenge current screening strategy allow propose inexpensive , fast , accessible NIPT trisomy 21 large number laboratory territory . Experimental design We evaluate approach pregnant woman cohort high risk T21 ( &gt; 1/250 ) , prospectively recruit three regional hospital cytogenetics laboratory . We propose preform single-blind retrospective analysis cell free DNA 100 pregnancy ( include 70 euploid 30 T21fetuses ) . Results obtain dPCR approach compare fetal karyotype beforehand perform . Digital PCR analyse perform Grenoble University Hospital , team significant experience digital PCR technology . Digital PCR reaction do QuantStudioâ„¢ 3D ( LifeTechnologies ) commercial high density chip etch 20,000 consistently-sized nanoscale reaction well . To improve analytical sensitivity , 10 replicates perform patient .</detailed_description>
