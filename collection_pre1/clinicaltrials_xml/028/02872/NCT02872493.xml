	<brief_title>Small Bowel Length Bariatric Surgery Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery ( also know `` weight loss surgery '' ) effective treatment obesity well number obesity-related condition , include type 2 diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia . Interestingly , patient respond significant weight loss follow surgery patient even lack much weight loss long-term . Even though variability treatment response observe variety disease , biological basis variability weight loss bariatric surgery poorly understood . Recent data group well others , however , suggest difference total length small intestine may significantly contribute difference weight loss time . For example , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass think exert weight loss effect bypass small intestine cause degree nutrient malabsorption . The bypassed small intestine ( &lt; 100cm ) near proximal end intestine closest stomach . Hypothetically , individual great total small intestine length may benefit much bypass someone much short length total small intestine . Whether hypothetical relationship true remain unknown , recent study demonstrate small intestine length differ significantly individual lengths range 300cm &gt; 1200cm . The total length small intestine routinely measure bariatric procedure , lengths bypass limb determine portion intestine closest stomach . The purpose study determine whether amount total small intestine significantly affect weight loss patient undergo bariatric surgery - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy ( VSG ) . If significant effect total small intestine length long-term weight loss bariatric patient , would justify conduct study determine whether operation perform differently individual account difference small intestine length . This observational study look body weight ( primary endpoint ) nutritional endpoint ( pre-specified outcome measure ) time ten year patient cohort . The body weight measurement laboratory data collect part routine clinical care patient .</detailed_description>
