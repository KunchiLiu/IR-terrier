	<brief_summary>This study aim examine whether pain topical photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) significantly different use low irradiance ambulatory light emit diode ( LED ) device compare conventional high irradiance hospital base LED light source use superficial non-melanoma skin cancer . The investigator also investigate phototoxicity efficacy regime randomize assessor-blinded clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison Low Conventional Irradiance PDT Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized assessor-blinded comparative study low irradiance ambulatory LED device conventional hospital-based LED device superficial non-melanoma skin cancer . Preliminary observation suggest low irradiance LEDs cause less pain effective , investigator examine clinical trial patient lesion &lt; /= 2cm diameter non-melanoma skin cancer ( Bowen 's disease superficial basal cell carcinoma ) . Patients condition refer PDT clinic invite participate eligible consent treatment prospectively randomize either ambulatory PDT conventional PDT . Pain phototoxicity score record clinical efficacy assess one year last treatment . Computer-generated block randomization perform 90 % power detect significant 5 % level mean difference pain score 2 one group compare 4 , 36 patient need , participant often elderly frail investigator aim safety margin recruit 50 participant account drop-outs . Participants receive two treatment either arm one week interval assess clinically three month residual disease remain two treatment week apart repeat . Pain assess use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score phototoxicity semi-quantitative scale record 7 day participant return second treatment . Follow clinical assessment 6 month one year treatment . Participants also give opinion treatment one year follow . Assessors adverse effect efficacy blind . Data record analysis undertaken study statistician Dr Robert Dawe analysis intention treat basis use appropriate statistical test compare pre-planned outcome measure , pain primary outcome outcome , efficacy patient satisfaction secondary outcome</detailed_description>
