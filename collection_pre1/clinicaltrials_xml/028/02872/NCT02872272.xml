	<brief_summary>The loss skin barrier function burn cause increase susceptibility infection , lead cause morbidity mortality burn patient . Topical antibiotic one part therapeutic arsenal available treat infection . Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus two major colonize agent find population patient . The use dressing impregnate amikacin common practice . Actually , available data local systemic effect antibiotic . The study tissue plasma pharmacokinetics amikacin therefore important secure optimize singular use amikacin improve care burn patient . The objective study describe plasma tissue pharmacokinetics amikacin dermal administration impregnate dress estimate pharmacokinetic parameter variability burn population . Secondary objective ass one hand relationship effectiveness treatment concentration antibiotic site tissue infection , hand ass relationship plasma concentration toxicity find treatment . We would like also note efficacy antibiotic treatment term : need repeat surgery ( new skin graft ) , heal time hospital length stay . Blood sample skin biopsy make patient day 3 day 7 start treatment . The knowledge tissue concentration obtain possible systemic absorption provide additional safety data optimize condition use dressing ( dosage , frequency administration ) effective treatment safe .</brief_summary>
