	<brief_title>Beacon BNX™ Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) -Needle vs SharkCore™ Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : A tissue core biopsy preserve architecture critical diagnose fully characterize certain neoplasm , lymphoma GI stromal tumor ( GIST ) . Moreover , tissue specimen histologic examination also provide opportunity immunostain tissue , increase differential diagnostic capability ; reach specific diagnosis benign diseases always obtainable cytological sample , thus spar patient invasive risky sampling procedure costly unnecessary follow-up examination ; perform tissue profile and/or cell culture need guide targeted therapy individualize treatment patient cancer GI tract . There previously needle available market accurately consistently acquire EUS-guided histologic tissue solid gastrointestinal lesion . Covidien recently release novel SharkCore™ Fine Needle Biopsy ( FNB ) system EUS-guided tissue acquisition solid gastrointestinal lesion . With unique bevel design , needle show promising result acquire histologic tissue per oral communication physician around country ( Douglas Adler Christopher DiMaio ) . Currently , publish clinical data capability SharkCore™ needle obtain specimen via EUS guidance . The rationale currently propose trial ass operate characteristic SharkCore™ needle system determine ability needle system yield histologic tissue . Medtronic Inc. provide u unrestricted grant order evaluate capability new 22G SharkCore™ needle obtain tissue specimen compare performance standard 22G BNX EUS-FNA . Primary Objectives The primary objective propose prospective randomize , multi-center study evaluate capability new 22G SharkCore™ needle obtain tissue specimen compare performance standard 22G BNX Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine needle aspiration ( Beacon Endoscopic , Newton , MA ) needle evaluation solid mass lesion pancreas gastrointestinal tract . The secondary objective determine ability 22G SharkCore™ needle system yield histologic tissue . Study Design We propose prospective comparative study ( 22G SharkCore™ needle versus 22G BNX EUS-FNA needle ) randomize ( randomization order needle ) crossover ( lesion ) sample solid pancreatic gastrointestinal tumor . Up 6 site United States enroll patient . The respective institutional investigator review serious adverse event throughout study . No interim analysis plan .</detailed_description>
