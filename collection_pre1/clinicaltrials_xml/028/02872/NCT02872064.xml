	<brief_title>Treatment Primary Breast Cancer Using PDT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I / IIa study recruit patient diagnose primary breast cancer . Patients choose mastectomy wide local excision surgical option include . Patients pre therapy MRI follow photodynamic therapy . PDT involve intravenously injecting photosensitizer Verteporfin ( Visudyne ) drug . This drug make tumour sensitive light . A non-thermal light shone tumour brings tissue necrosis ( destruction ) . Although drug dose remain , light dose escalated depend patient response accordance predefined algorithm ( see section ) achieve zone necrosis 12mm plateau necrosis incremental increase light dose . An MRI perform immediately prior schedule surgery . Pre post PDT MRI change correlate histological finding excise breast specimen . Should minimum light dose 12mm necrosis establish recruitment continue 12 patient receive dose . These 12 patient provide sample data size tumour area necrosis detect MRI histology enable sample size ( power ) calculation future study PDT primary breast cancer . This dose escalation study involve minimum twelve maximum forty patient .</detailed_description>
