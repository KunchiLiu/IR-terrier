	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab High-risk Ductal Carcinoma Situ ( DCIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include 3 dose cohort use 3+3 cohort dose escalation design ( see figure 1 ) follow 4th cohort maximum tolerate dose . Unless dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , define grade 3 4 toxicity , observe require expansion cohort subject withdraws , 3 subject enrol cohort dose escalation phase . Subjects , upon diagnosis high risk DCIS , offer 2 dos pembrolizumab inject intralesionally ( IL ) 3 week apart ( +/- 1 week ) surgery 3 week ( +/- 2 week ) 2nd dose . The subject undergo surgical treatment determine surgeon subject ( partial mastectomy mastectomy ) . The primary objective phase study safety feasibility intralesional injection pembrolizumab . The maximum tolerate dose use expansion phase . The expansion cohort target enrollment 30 subject randomize either control group treatment group . 10 subject randomize control group 20 subject randomize treatment group . The control group proceed surgery alone follow diagnosis high risk DCIS . The treatment group receive 2 dos intralesional pembrolizumab 3 week apart ( +/- 1 week ) prior surgery . All subject expansion cohort also undergo baseline MRI diagnosis undergo 2nd MRI prior surgery . Baseline pre-surgical MRI image evaluate change tumor volume .</detailed_description>
