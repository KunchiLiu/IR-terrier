	<brief_summary>This pilot study eventually result main randomise control trial look management associate high rate normal birth lower rate chorioamnionitis ( maternal infection ) woman break water labour start . Spontaneous rupture membrane ( water break ) term ( 37-42 week gestation ) physiological event happen labour . However , accord Gunn et al . ( 1970 ) 8-10 % case membrane rupture labour start . The time rupture onset labour call latent phase time wise variable . Studies show statistically significant difference term neonatal infection chorioamnionitis investigator induce labour prostaglandin compare labour start spontaneously ( Hannah et al 1996 ) . Seaward et al . ( 1997 ) note number confound factor might relate incidence chorioamnionitis ( maternal infection ) , strong predictor 8 vaginal examination since rupture membrane delivery strong predictor duration latent phase . It think reduce number internal examination , chorioamnionitis may reduce , hence neonatal infection may also reduce . The main RCT compare clinical outcome maternal satisfaction woman consent randomized four group : ( 1 ) Active management routine internal examination labour , ( 2 ) Active management reduce internal examination , ( 3 ) Expectant management routine internal examination , ( 4 ) Expectant management reduce internal examination . This application seek ethic approval pilot phase ensure definitive study undertaken appropriately . It important test component work well individually whole , estimate sample size ultimately test integrity research protocol embark main trial .</brief_summary>
