	<brief_summary>The chemotherapy monitor currently base radiological ( RECIST 1.1 guideline ) clinical evaluation every 3 month . Circulating marker Carcino Embryonic Antigen ( CEA ) , circulate tumour DNA total cell free DNA represent alternative approach evaluate response . In field metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) recent study suggest early evaluation could clinically relevant . Indeed , early tumoral response seem correlate overall survival . Moreover , post-operative morbidity increase number prior chemotherapy treatment . Early evaluation could allow modify chemotherapy regimen response appear insufficient . The aim present study evaluate , prospective cohort patient treat systemic IV chemotherapy ( 5 Fluorouracil +/- oxaliplatin +/- irinotecan ) +/- target therapy first line treatment mCRC , correlation early variation circulate tumour marker include CEA , circulate tumour DNA total cell free DNA , 3 month objective response define RECIST 1.1 guideline .</brief_summary>
