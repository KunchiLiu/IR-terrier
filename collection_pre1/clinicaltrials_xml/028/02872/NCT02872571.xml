	<brief_summary>The liver may optimal site islet transplantation due obstacle instant blood-mediated inflammatory response , low revascularization transplant islet . Therefore , intramuscular islet transplantation offer attractive alternative , base simplicity , enable easy access noninvasive graft image cell explantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The field β cell replacement therapy progress extensively last decade . It well establish successful intraportal islet transplantation restore endogenous β cell function subject type 1 diabetes mellitus . In fact , graft function optimal , insulin independence consistently prolong 5 year 50 % patient . Several factor influence outcome performance graft upon implantation . For instance , preclinical study confirm significant difference utilize several site implantation islet graft , utilized clinical approach embolization liver . However , become evidently clear liver may optimal environment recipient site pancreatic islet , owe immunologic , also anatomic physiologic factor may promote decline islet function . Moreover , intrahepatic islet infusion often associate immediate blood- mediate inflammatory reaction , thrombosis hepatic tissue ischemia elevate blood liver enzymes . In addition , cross-talk activated coagulation inflammatory mediator implantation , dramatically affect islet cell survival engraftment , result β cell dysfunction death , depict primary nonfunction consequence reduce functional islet mass . This intrahepatic environment appear potently impair metabolic function transplant islet . Furthermore , complication associate graft recovery within hepatic site , limit potential application exploit insulin-secreting cell obtain alternative cell source . These include xenogenic islet , immortalize β cell line , embryonic stem cell , adult progenitor cell , include β cell encapsulation . Restoration β cell function highly desirable goal patient unstable diabetes ; therefore , search alternative site safer islet transplantation imperative . In man , autotransplantation mince tissue striate muscle follow blunt dissection successfully use parathyroid surgery several decade . Initially demonstrate rodent early 1980s , intramuscular islet transplantation ( IMIT ) rarely consider clinically feasible implantation site . This study want provide direct evidence feasibility function autologous islet transplant muscle</detailed_description>
