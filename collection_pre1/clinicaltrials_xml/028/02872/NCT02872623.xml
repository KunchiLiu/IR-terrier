	<brief_summary>Early diagnosis tumor small intestine challenge clinician radiologist . The detection tumor small intestine field video capsule endoscopy low performance . The entero-CT enteroclysis imaging technique use primarily explore patient strong suspicion small intestine tumor . However entero-CT enteroclysis disadvantage : irradiating , nasojejunal tube implies discomfort patient complicate examination term logistics necessity specific equipment insert nasojejunal tube . MRI propose alternative imaging technique satisfactory result report MRI enteroclysis . However , technique several disadvantage relate nasojejunal tube insertion necessity equipment compatible high magnetic field . The enterography-MRI without enteroclysis , whose principle distend small intestine ingestion large quantity liquid , major undisputed role exploration Crohn 's disease small bowel . However , capacity distension small intestine optimal tumor detection question role tumor detection largely unknown .</brief_summary>
