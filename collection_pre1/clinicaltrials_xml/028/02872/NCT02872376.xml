	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Anemia common extraintestinal manifestation IBD , occur 6 74 percent patient . This wide range prevalence anemia relate difference study design , criterion use define anemia increase awareness anemia patient . According recent meta-analysis European study involve 2192 IBD patient , overall prevalence anemia Europe 27 % , ulcerative colitis patient less likely develop anemia Crohn 's disease . Therefore , anemia represent significant clinical social burden IBD management ; evident southern Europe prevalence anemia close 40 % . Most case anemia IBD due iron deficiency ( IDA ) anemia inflammation ( AI ) . Guidelines concern diagnosis treatment IDA IBD publish European Crohn 's Colitis Organisation . According present guideline iron supplementation start IDA present even presence iron deficiency without anemia . A meta-analysis iron supplementation study IBD-associated IDA find intravenous iron effective well tolerate oral iron supplementation , sample size include study small ; absolute indication intravenous iron include severe anemia ( haemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL ) intolerance inadequate response oral iron . Although ECCO diagnostic criterion IDA simple , iron supplementation represent cheap usually effective treatment , many IBD patient IDA properly treat . The inconsistent adherence , many physician , treatment guideline IDA IBD often motivate belief mild moderate degree anemia may significant impact patient 's quality life represent main clinical problem patient , oral iron supplementation may adversely affect disease activity , parenteral iron administration may cause severe side effect . RATIONALE In order improve diagnostic therapeutic work-up anemia IBD , necessary precisely define prevalence pathogenesis anemia Italian IBD population gain information anemic patient , particularly IDA , usually manage followed-up . In addition , since IDA AI common form anemia IBD , mechanisms often concur pathogenesis anemia subject , stringent diagnostic criterion distinguish three condition ( IDA , AI coexistence IDA AI ) urgently need . The differential diagnosis IDA AI often difficult since inflammation modifies serum ferritin transferrin saturation ( TfSat ) become unreliable indicator iron status . Recently , serum hepcidin concentration identify new index iron status useful differentiate IDA AI IBD . Hepcidin , peptide produce liver response increase iron store , inflammation reduce erythropoietic activity , master regulator body iron homeostasis act inhibit iron absorption iron release hepatocytes macrophage plasma . The potential role serum hepcidin determination diagnostic tool differential diagnosis anemia IBD inflammatory disease must clearly define . The investigation topic important since accurate pathogenetic diagnosis anemia IBD , prevent useless potentially harmful treatment AI iron supplementation , might allow identification appropriate treatment IDA patient presence inflammation . STUDY DESIGN We perform longitudinal , prospective , observational study whose aim determination prevalence pathogenesis anemia IBD patient . Anemia define accord WHO criterion : Hb &lt; 13.0 g/dL male Hb &lt; 12 g/dL female . Anemia work-up initiate whenever Hb concentration normal include determination laboratory parameter report CRF . A serum ferritin &lt; 100 Âµg/L transferrin saturation &lt; 20 % require diagnosis isolate IDA association IDA inflammation . We plan involve least 60 IG-IBD Centers observational study . We expect include 2000 anemic patient study ; approximately 80 90 % patient form iron deficiency and/or AI . This allow evaluate difference prevalence IDA AI accord gender , age , diagnosis , time diagnosis , presence inflammation , activity , extension behaviour disease , evaluate variable associate type severity anemia univariate multivariate analysis . Expected duration subject participation observational therapeutic trial 24 week ; anemic patient recruit study undergo screen investigate mechanism anemia , follow-up evaluation perform week 4 , 12 24 . At follow-up , information treatment anemia , fatigue quality life must collect . OBJECTIVES Primary endpoint observational study determine prevalence anemia Italian patient IBD . Secondary objective study ) investigate pathogenesis anemia IBD , particular focus differential diagnosis IDA AI , disease activity , extension behavior influence relative frequency IDA AI ; b ) verify adherence ECCO guideline treatment IDA IBD ( proportion patient IDA receive adequate iron supplementation ) ; c ) administer dedicate questionnaire patient order measure influence anemia fatigue quality life among IBD patient .</detailed_description>
