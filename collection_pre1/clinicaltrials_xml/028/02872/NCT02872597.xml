	<brief_title>Phase I , Placebo-Controlled , Blinded Pilot Study Ipratropium Children Admitted ICU With Status Asthmaticus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Status asthmaticus acute exacerbation asthma often require treatment pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . Standard therapies status asthmaticus include corticosteroid bronchodilator , typically albuterol . Ipratropium bromide also bronchodilator , different mechanism action albuterol . The addition Ipraropium child Emergency Room severe asthma exacerbation improve outcome , many PICU doctor treat patient status asthmaticus Ipratropium . However , two study child hospitalize general ward hospital ( PICU ) show addition Ipratropium standard care effect clinical outcome . This study first step towards determine Ipratropium helpful PICU patient ( like ER patient ) helpful ( like general ward patient ) .</detailed_description>
