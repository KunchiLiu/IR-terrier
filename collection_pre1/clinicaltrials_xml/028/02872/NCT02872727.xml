	<detailed_description>It well know nanoparticle ( NP ) rate high large metropolitan city also airport environment owe aircraft engine emission . Now , nanoparticulatepollution public health issue owe potential cardiovascular respiratory impact general population . Besides , evolution exposure airport environment observe , due implementation new protective equipment well adapt nanoparticles use new fuel . From October 2011 June 2012 , partnership network conduct first study assessment respiratory health Air France company'semployees work Marseillesand Paris airport ( flightline administrative employee ) . This study promote Montpellier CHRU , Regional University Hospital Centre ( ANSM identification number 2011-A00646-35 ) . It allow 471 voluntary employee involve . They answer lifestyle survey underwent spirometry , exhale CO measurement sample exhale air condensate ( EAC ) . A metrological study particle emit aircraft engine find airport environment conduct elementary chemical composition analysis , well sieve analysis particle present EACwere conduct . The data analysis first study ( whose publication currently draft ) give rise description respiratory health condition employee work vicinity nanoparticle production source , characterise exposure nanoparticles secondary emission originate aircraft engine exhaust gas , well description elementary particulate content EACsin whole population . The analysis respiratory function expose subject combine measurement characterisation nanoparticlesemitted aircraft engine ( metrology data analysis ) EACanalysis allow measurement exposure level assessment respiratory health employee airport environment . Besides , study population locate two airport two different city ( Roissy Charles de Gaulle Paris Marignanefor Marseilles ) . So far , longitudinal follow-up study airport NPsin large size sample carry , notably plurisdisciplinary scope . Yet longitudinal follow-up analysis cohortwill provide suitable impact study various exposure factor , take account integration . Now , large size cohortof subject expose secondary emission nanoparticlesor ultrafine particle ( UFP ) ever monitor France . The first previously conduct study enable u draw situational respiratory health analysis 471 employee . It also allow u measure nanoparticlesin exhale air evaluate UFPexposure rate work station . It relevant monitor evolution parameter course time well assess role possibly confound factor evolution respiratory health . The EAC collect mean simple device non-invasive tool provide useful information lung exposure , even inflammatory effect respiratory tract level . The EACis good propose methodology study exposure effect biomarkers professional exposure situation ( Mutti 2006 ; Corradi 2010 ) . Exposure biomarkers metal also study EACin connection smoking ( Mutti 2006 ) professional exposure metallic particle ( Goldoni 2010 , Goldoni2004 , Hoffmeyer2011 ) . In recent study , EACwas use order locate nanoparticlesand oxidative stress marker ( malondialdehydeand hydrogen peroxide H2O2 ) volunteer expose cigarette smoke ( Sauvain 2014 ) . As EACis highly dilute aqueous medium , report matrix effect . However , one difficulty lie use highly sensitive technique . In scope previous study , analysis technique already implement use 471 collected EACsamples . The Medical Biology Laboratory CEA Grenoble currently work methodology intend standardise analyse medium ( sodium measure parallel ICPMS , know standardisation propose literature : Dompeling 2010 ) methodology total protein assay ÂµBCA . The object new project proceed investigation employee cohort first study obtain remote evolution ( 5 year ) respiratory function measure nanoparticle exposure . This enable u assess possible link exposure respiratory function evolution employee</detailed_description>
