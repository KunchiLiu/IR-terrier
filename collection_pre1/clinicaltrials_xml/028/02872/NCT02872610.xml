Mixed model use assess change time suicidal thought level depression , measurement baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 week ( post-test ) well long-term effect 32 week ( 6 month post-test ) . Changes secondary outcome , apart participant 's depression level , measure ANCOVA use multiple imputation . The investigator use Cohen 's test determine difference intervention control condition . If true difference experimental control mean 0.3 Danish trial pool standard deviation post-test 1 expect , 350 participant condition need order reject null hypothesis difference intervention control condition post-test suicidal thought probability ( power ) 0.8 . The type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . By account drop-out rate 20 % , total 438 participant need SOS-trial .
