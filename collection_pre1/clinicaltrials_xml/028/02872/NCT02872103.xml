	<brief_title>Placebo-controlled Trial F-627 Women With Breast Cancer Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , multi-center , single dose , double-blind , placebo control phase III study efficacy safety once-per-cycle F-627 woman stage II-IV breast cancer receive myelotoxic TA chemotherapy treatment ( Taxotere ( docetaxel ) + Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) ) . F-627 design treat neutropenia , abnormally low number neutrophil ( type white blood cell ) blood . Neutropenia often see cancer patient receive myelotoxic chemotherapy . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety single fix dose F-627 breast cancer patient experience myelotoxic chemotherapy comparison placebo . F-627 placebo administer subcutaneously 24 hour chemotherapy 21-day cycle chemotherapy treatment ( 4 cycle ) . Patients randomize placebo arm receive F-627 except cycle 1 . The primary endpoint duration grade 4 ( severe ) neutropenia - number day patient absolute neutrophil count ( ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10^9/L ) observe chemotherapy cycle 1 .</detailed_description>
