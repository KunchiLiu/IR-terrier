Be schedule undergo surgery , chemotherapy , drug treatment and/or radiation treatment prevention medical condition malignancy risk cause permanent complete loss subsequent testicular function . Risk category base treatment regimen indicate . Investigators utilize three source calculate risk : 1 . `` Fertile Hope Risks Azoospermia '' brochure detail typical agent treatment regimens risk category , 2. Summed Alkylating Agent dose score , 3. Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose method . Because complexity many treatment regimen , patient risk categorization discretion investigator . . High Risk . ≥80 % risk prolong azoospermia , Fertile Hope Brochure . ii . Summed alkylating agent dose score ≥3 . iii . Cyclophosphamide equivalent dose ≥7,500mg/m2 . b . Intermediate risk ( 2179 % risk prolong azoospermia , Fertile Hope ) . c. Low Risk ( ≤20 % risk prolong azoospermia , Fertile Hope ) . d. Eligibility limit patient High risk category . 3 . Or , medical condition malignancy require removal part one testicle . Or , medical condition ( genetic autoimmune ) result decline fertility e.g . Klinefelter syndrome . 4 .
