	<brief_summary>IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) recently identify rare disease characterize inflammatory lesion polyclonal lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate , IgG4+ plasma cell predominance , fibrosis involve tissue . Despite preferential involvement exocrine organ , virtually tissue affect disease . Corticosteroids usually effective indication , poor tolerance high risk relapse decrease withdrawal treatment . In context , identification new therapeutic target major concern patient . Physiopathology IgG4-RD remain actually unknown . In previous study , show T follicular Helper ( Tfh ) cell expand blood patient . Tfh cell important role formation germinal center ( GCs ) , ectopic GCs find tissue patient IgG4-RD . Tfh cell major role proliferation differentiation B cell compartment . In context , population could important contribution pathophysiology IgG4-RD could represent therapeutic target disease . TIFOLH4 study intend analyze tissue Tfh cell patient IgG4-RD diagnosis . This study exploratory prospective multicentric study . Thirty patient suspect diagnosis IgG4-RD , 1 suggestive organ involve , include study . A 50 mL blood sample biopsy , obtain time diagnostic biopsy sample , obtain study . The result obtain patient confirmed diagnosis IgG4-RD ( `` IgG4-RD group `` ) compare result patient another diagnosis ( `` control group `` ) . Main objective study show confocal microscopy expansion number Tfh cell ( CD3+CD4+PD1+ cell ) tissue IgG4-RD patient compare control . Secondary objective include : tissue analysis Tfh subset ( Tfh1 , Tfh2 Tfh17 ) ; tissue analysis B regulatory cell , T regulatory cell , T helper cell ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 ) ; correlation tissue circulate biomarkers ; tissue proteomic analysis ; functional analysis circulate Tfh cell sort cell co-culture test autologous naive B cell . All result compare `` IgG4-RD group `` `` control group `` . This study clarify role Tfh population IgG4-RD , identify diagnostic tissue blood biomarkers , identify therapeutic target patient .</brief_summary>
