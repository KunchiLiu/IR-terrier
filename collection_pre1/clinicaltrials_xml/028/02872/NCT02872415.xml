	<brief_summary>Numerous experimental clinical study show preterm neonate particularly sensitive stress . Preterm neonates routinely undergo painful invasive procedure . Each situation cause pain discomfort alter development cause short term cardiovascular consequence also long-term neurocognitive influence . Repetitive procedural pain also lead change pain sensitivity threshold therefore . The common painful procedure lance blood glucose test . In adult , infant term newborn , forearm blood glucose test demonstrate less painful conventional site ( heel , finger ) . But data lack preterm neonate . The primary purpose study demonstrate significant reduction pain response forearm blood lance vs conventional site ( finger , heel ) preterm neonates born 32 week gestation . This study interventional multicenter ( 3 center ) , randomize , double bind trial cross assignment . 60 premature neonate bear 23 32 week . Gestation postnatal age le 72 hour undergo least 3 blood glucose prick include . The different site randomly successively test .</brief_summary>
