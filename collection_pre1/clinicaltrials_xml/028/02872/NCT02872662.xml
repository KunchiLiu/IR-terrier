	<detailed_description>This study aim develop highly sensitive method early detection relapse base patient unique mutation . Screening mutation In collaboration Department clinical genetics , Uppsala , initial screening mutation perform use commercial TrueSightÂ© sequence panel include 54 gene recurrently mutate myeloid disease . Based mutation identify , PCR-primers patient-specific mutation design . Patients without mutation exclude study . The mutational screen perform soon patient identify potential candidate allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) evaluate optimal pre-SCT treatment . The patient include study bone marrow sample precede SCT . In case mutational screen perform pre-SCT MDS treatment , mutational screen diagnostic national biobank sample ( peripheral blood ) perform . MRD surveillance After transplantation , peripheral blood sample collect monthly ; bone marrow sample collect month 1 , 3 , 6 SCT follow sample every third month relapse death . The sample send Biobanking Molecular Resource Infrastructure Sweden ( bbmri ) extract DNA store sample . By use highly sensitive digital-PCR method investigator determine size different clone different time point . In addition biobanking DNA , bbmri collect vital froze mononuclear cell ( MNCs ) use experimental study . Statistics Landmark analyse perform different time point SCT , use presence MRDs risk factor include multivariate analysis . Furthermore , investigator calculate sensitivity , specificity predictive value MRDs relation relapse . For specific mutation , high enough frequency cohort , investigator define cut-off value MRD relapse impending .</detailed_description>
