	<brief_summary>The aim study verify use Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) associate peripheral electrical stimulation ( PES ) analgesic effect individual Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . The association tDCS PES may additive effect pain control , alternative pain control patient SCD . This technique safe inexpensive , able contribute control symptom improve quality life individual . Its effect may decrease pain intensity / increase period episode acute pain . It may also affect pain modulatory pathway brain interfere thalamocortical dysthymia , phenomenon associate decreased modulation thalamus primary motor cortex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease group inherit disease whose cause presence S hemoglobin ( HbS ) , come point mutation β-globin gene , lead substitution amino Glutamic Acid Valine acid sixth position β chain . There mutant hemoglobin , C hemoglobin ( HbC ) , D hemoglobin ( HbD ) , E hemoglobin ( HbE ) , among others , associate HbS ( i.e . heterozygous sickle cell C hemoglobin ( SC ) , heterozygous sickle cell D hemoglobin ( SD ) , heterozygous sickle cell E hemoglobin ( SE ) ) form group call sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , sickle cell anemia ( SS ) know . Pain , various manifestation , symptom often associate SCD , responsible 90 % hospital admission . Oftenly pain major impact patient 's life associate degree disability . Chronic pain may reflect continuity tissue injury central nervous system maladaptive plasticity . They start tissue injury leg ulcer , avascular osteonecrosis , chronic osteomyelitis , arthropathy , even continue repair process , central nervous sensitization / peripheral . The lack diagnosis case chronic neuropathic pain patient SCD common , imply inappropriate use therapeutic resource health service , result increased suffering patient . The release inflammatory mediator related perception pain , may cause nociceptor sensitization . Even huge pharmaceutical development , still extremely difficult treat chronic pain individual satisfactorily . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-pharmacological non-invasive technique pain control alternative treatment patient SCD . tDCS potential change neuronal membrane rest potential , effect dependent polarity , cathode produce hyperpolarization , whereas anode produce depolarization , way induce effect inhibition facilitation neuronal firing , respectively . This effect induce change cortical excitability . Although tDCS may modulate area relate endogenous pain control , effect seem diffuse , focality would probably enhance effect . Peripheral electrical stimulation ( PES ) , another way , may also modulate cortical excitability , depend mainly amplitude frequency . PES modulation cortical excitability focal , occur stimulate region . The easy safe way administer PES trough transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , non-pharmacological conservative method widely use health professional aim relieve pain . The combination two neuromodulatory technique may additive effect , one promote general effect ( tDCS ) , focal effect ( TENS ) . However , combine way excitatory effect , effect may cancel trough metaplastic mechanism . Combing excitatory inhibitory technique may additive effect . Although additive effect demonstrate pathological condition , yet show SCD , disease particular characteristic present lifespan individual , provoke many source tissue injury present acute crisis chronic phase . As secondary outcome , investigator go access influence intervention quantitative electroencephalography ( qEEG ) . Growing evidence point different brain characteristic individual chronic pain healthy . qEEG high temporal resolution evaluate primary electrical effect neural excitation , allow identify possible pattern brain functioning individual chronic pain . qEEG allow identification thalamocortical dysrhythmia ( TCD ) patient chronic pain characterize increase low frequency band power density theta ( 4 - 7Hz ) decrease high frequency band alpha ( 8 -12Hz ) beta ( 13 - 30Hz ) . This dysrhythmic mechanism may occur periphery thalamus ( bottom-up ) cortical dysregulation ( top-down ) , disinhibition thalamus . This process result hyperpolarization thalamic neuron , lead preponderance low frequency oscillation qEEG . The persistence thalamic firing low frequency lead collateral inhibition cortical region around , could theoretically lead decrease high frequency . This increase occur low frequency region involve neuro matrix pain . The mediator release cell immune inflammatory system act directly neuron sensitize enable ( usually peripheral nociceptors neuron dorsal horn spinal cord ) . There several mediator long grow list include cytokine neurotrophins.The major cytokine acute inflammation Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) interleukins ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 IL-8 , important mediator acute chronic inflammatory reaction , well process repair resolution . High serum level IL-8 observe patient vase-occlusive crisis , important clinical aspect pathogenesis SCD . The presence mutant allele A appear influence expression TNF-alpha , AA genotype consider high producer . Neurotrophins dimeric proteins essential normal development nervous system vertebrate . This family include nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) neurotrophins ( NT ) . Currently , recognize certain neurotrophins , particularly NGF brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF play significant role nociception , NGF sensitize nociceptors periphery , BDNF enhance response ability dorsal horn neuron spinal cord . The BDNF gene , encode BDNF protein , locate chromosome 11 boundary region 11p13 11p14 human genome investigate wide range area relate neuroplasticity , include difference brain morphology , learn memory , interaction brain stimulation protocols plasticity induction recovery brain injury associate wide variety neurological disorder , include , example , depression , schizophrenia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .</detailed_description>
