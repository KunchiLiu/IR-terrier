	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterize deficit social communicative skill , restrict set interest , activity and/or repetitive behaviour typically observe early childhood . The prevalence ASD 1 68 child fast grow developmental disability . The cost diagnose treat ASD estimate around $ 236-262 billion annually . Plasticity broadly refer susceptibility organism change . The human brain show incredible plastic capacity . Multiple neuronal network sustain cognitive function ( mental ability ) different system support function different individual . This `` many-to-one '' structure-function relationship one form plasticity . Examining neural network responsible cognitive process different individual provide insight plastic capacity process . Cognitive training centered notion plasticity . It entail repeat exercise specific cognitive process ( multiple process ) several week , performance gain expect trained task well various untrained task directly indirectly involve targeted cognitive process ( ) . The generalization performance gain untrained task term `` transfer '' essential efficacy training . Cognitive training use remediate deficit adult stroke , multiple sclerosis , Schizophrenia , child work memory deficit , child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , healthy pre-kindergarten child , well enhance cognitive performance healthy young adult , healthy old adult . Yet , benefit intervention child ASD receive relatively little attention . Recent research indicate disrupt pattern cortical development ASD may lead clinical manifestation . More specifically early report show pattern reduce long-range cortical connectivity increase localized functional connectivity ASD . This pattern recently verify use highly stringent image analysis method . This alter functional connectivity may especially disruptive cognitive function demand integrative information processing executive functioning ( high order cognitive function control cognitive process eg . Conscious control think action ) , theory mind , face processing , language communication , previously establish impaired process ASD . Moreover , approximately 50-70 % child ASD diagnose intellectual disability , manifest cognitive impairment . Intellectual disability show place child ASD risk `` low functioning '' trajectory throughout life risk severe symptom . Cognitive train show enhance executive function underlie intellectual capacity work memory , fluid intelligence , executive attention well academic achievement . Cognitive training deliver early age may strengthen process important intellectual capacity therefore improve clinical trajectory ASD . Although recent theory ASD point deficit executive function , field currently lack evidence-based intervention , directly tackle deficit executive function . The exist intervention ASD ( mainly consist behavioural skill development ) complex administration require highly trained staff . As result , approach place extremely high demand clinic practitioner create long wait list . These approach poor accessibility many family school . The striking consistent limitation exist intervention apparent lack transfer learn skill condition contexts . Meaning , new learn behaviour limit specific context train . Generalization task contexts distinguish strength cognitive training , approach use home via personal computer provide accessibility , use conjunction behavioral skill development improve child 's receptiveness learning . Thus , cognitive training may potential provide promise result area exist treatment show limitation . The present project intend first develop software base cognitive training program tailor cognitive need child ASD ( Cognitive Assessment Video-game Intervention Solutions , CAVINS ) ( phase 1 ) examine program 's efficacy clinical trial image brain ( Clinical Trials Imaging Phases ) . The imaging component provide opportunity learn neural framework target cognitive process well training-induced change process . This intervention target several function implicate ASD ability shift attention different aspect task , inhibitory control , work memory , planning , reason , selective attention , face processing . During image phase , first step , investigator use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) identify training-induced change brain associate set-shifting response inhibition . Response inhibition consist two distinct form , restraint response cancellation response . Preventing response initiate characterizes restraint process whereas termination response already underway represent cancellation process . Additionally ability monitor , detect adjust behaviour follow erroneous response represent error processing inherent component response inhibition . Difficulties response inhibition hypothesize responsible stereotype repetitive behaviour observe ASD , predictive `` theory mind '' performance preschooler , associate altered connectivity frontal cortex striatal parietal region well volume difference alter development striatum . Similarly , low accuracy set-shifting task associate reduced activation frontal , striatal , parietal cortex hypothesize responsible mental inflexibility , restrict repetitive behaviour observe ASD . Several image study demonstrate modification underlie neural network follow completion cognitive training healthy adult . However , similar study child scarce . Currently , study examine training-induced change within brain child ASD . Findings present project reveal benefit cognitive training ASD , generalization persistence potential benefit , identify biological change associate training , provide much need insight plasticity system support two cognitive function implicate ASD .</detailed_description>
