	<detailed_description>The primary objective ass overall risk major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) among naloxegol-treated patient compare among patient prescription non-peripherally act mu-opioid antagonist ( PAMORA ) opioid induce constipation ( OIC ) treatment . The corresponding analysis new-user cohort study capture occurrence MACE person receive naloxegol comparison medication . The study take place actual-use setting US exist electronic data capture patient diagnosis , health care , treatment . The occurrence MACE naloxegol-treated patient compare occurrence MACE medically-similar new user prescription-only treatment OIC setting , naloxegol-treated comparison medication-treated patient follow long continue therapy . In pursuit primary objective , self-controlled study follow member new-user cohort , include new naloxegol user new user comparator product , long data available patient may go treatment . A self-controlled study offer complementary approach statistical control possible confounding effect personal characteristic . Using data source , self-controlled design follow individual time finish first course treatment new user long study continue . Patient treatment statuses continuously update since treatment choice exercise patient caregiver create extend period study time naloxegol possibly therapies OIC . Comparisons occurrence MACE occur within individual unaffected difference individual , crossover trial . The first secondary objective ass potential confounding effect lifestyle risk factor relative risk MACE among naloxegol-treated patient compare among patient prescription non-PAMORA OIC treatment . The corresponding analysis case-control study nest within primary study population . All MACE `` case '' match member cohort ( `` control '' ) . In case control , outpatient medical record abstract information lifestyle risk factor . The case-control analysis provide information presence effect lifestyle confound factor may identifiable chart review . Further secondary analysis investigate relative risk analyze intent-to-treat paradigm fix time period membership naloxegol comparator cohort , relative risk specific component MACE , relative risk associate new oral PAMORA agent naloxegol ( non-naloxegol oral PAMORAs [ NNPAMORAs ] ) may come onto US market course study , exploration possible variation risk associate variation dose time naloxegol dispense case-control study .</detailed_description>
