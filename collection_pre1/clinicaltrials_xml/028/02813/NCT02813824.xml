	<brief_summary>The propose trial evaluate effect aspirin 300 mg/d 100 mg/d 4 year vs placebo , 4 group randomise parallel design Lynch syndrome patient : patient prove carrier pathological mutation mismatch repair gene patient personal family history characterize Lynch syndrome accord modify Amsterdam criterion without proven mutation , age 18 year sign informed consent . The main hypothesis test aspirin could decrease colorectal adenoma recurrence evaluate high quality follow-up colonic chromo-endoscopy Lynch syndrome patient . The trial also explore : ( ) colorectal neoplasia recurrence accord different germline alteration mismatch repair gene , ( ii ) observance chemoprevention Lynch syndrome patient , ( iii ) burden adverse event attributable aspirin Lynch syndrome patient , ( iv ) dose-effect aspirin adenomatous polyp burden . All pathological sample review use centralized procedure . The INCA regional network organization HNPCC patient organization allow recruitment follow-up large number patient well characterise Lynch syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Chemoprevention Low-dose Aspirin New Recurrent Colorectal Adenomas Patients With Lynch Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lynch syndrome ( LS ) common inherited colorectal cancer syndrome , result germline mutation mismatch repair gene confer high lifetime risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) ( 60 70 % ) . Most CRCs arise asymptomatic polyp . Development polyps cancer prevent polyp detect early endoscopy remove . Colonoscopy propose every 2 year LS patient 25 year old , every year colonic neoplasia detect . Efficient chemoprevention potential represent cost-effective intervention patient could allow delay colonoscopic surveillance . Several epidemiological study show regular use low dose aspirin ( 75 300 mg/d ) associate 20 30 % reduction risk sporadic colonic polyp CRC . Four randomise control trial ( RCT ) also show decrease colorectal polyp recurrence . In pooled analysis cardio-vascular prevention RCTs , well meta-analysis , daily aspirin associate reduce risk CRC CRC associate mortality . Aspirin preventive benefit expect outweigh putative side effect high risk patient . The CAPP2 study Lynch syndrome patient show aspirin ( 300 mg x2/d ) reduce significantly risk colorectal neoplasia 29 month , extend follow-up ( mean 56 month ) show reduction colorectal cancer aspirin group . In study , endoscopic follow-up optimal relatively low detection rate colorectal neoplasia accord usual report rate chromo-endoscopy perform . So , real effect clinical benefit aspirin still characterise Lynch syndrome patient .</detailed_description>
