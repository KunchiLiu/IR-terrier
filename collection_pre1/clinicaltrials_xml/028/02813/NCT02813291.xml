	<brief_summary>The mental repetition movement - motor imagery ( MI ) practice - facilitates motor learn . It allow avoid fatigue occurs physical practice ; method thus particularly interesting elderly people . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) noninvasive method neurostimulation low direct current apply brain via electrode place scalp . This method successfully use enhance motor learn young elderly subject . The main aim study assess impact MI practice combine tDCS learning complex finger sequence , young elderly subject . For purpose , young elderly healthy subject randomly assign Stimulation Sham group . There thus total four group : Young Stim , Young Sham , Elderly Stim , Elderly Sham . All subject participate three training session spread five day , retention test one week third training session . During train mentally repeat complex finger sequence leave hand , 13 min : - Subjects Stimulation group ( Young Stim Elderly Stim ) receive parallel anodal tDCS primary motor cortex . - Subjects Sham group ( Young Sham Elderly Sham ) receive parallel sham tDCS primary motor cortex . Immediately ( pretest ) ( posttest ) training session , well retention test , subject repeat sequence many time possible , 1 min . During test ( pretests , posttests retention test ) electroencephalographic activity record ass Mu rhythm power .</brief_summary>
