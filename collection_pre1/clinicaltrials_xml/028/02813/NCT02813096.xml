	<brief_title>Study Folfox4 Chemotherapy Regimen Prevent Early Postoperative Recurrence HCC-PVTT Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curative resective well-accepted predominant treatment hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient . Unfortunately , long-term prognosis remain poor due frequent postoperative recurrence , especially HCC patient portal vein tumor thrombus ( PVTT ) . When PVTT invade portal vein system , tumor cell spread distribute along portal vein branch , thus result intra-hepatic micro-metastasis contributes early recurrence patient follow curative resection . Postoperative adjuvant intervention include TACE , antiviral therapy , immunotherapy , local radiotherapy apply prevent recurrence . However , efficacy safety regimens remain unsatisfactory . Thus new therapeutic strategy remain investigate . This study investigate efficacy safety Folfox4 chemotherapy regimen prevent early recurrence HCC patient PVTT follow curative resection .</detailed_description>
