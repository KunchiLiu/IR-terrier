	<brief_summary>This proposal describe pilot study gather preliminary evidence efficacy , tolerability toxicity oral PLE among high-risk skin cancer population prevention Actinic keratosis ( AKs ) keratinocytes ( KCs ) gain insight optimal method recruitment , intervention development , data collection , promote protocol adherence prior conduct fully power trial . The primary clinical outcome AKs measure clinical dermatologist , skin cancer secondary clinical outcome . The investigator also assess histologic marker Ultra Violet ( UV ) damage , previously show reduced oral PLE use human study , namely formation UV-induced cyclo pyrimidine dimer positive cell number sunburn cell among epidermal keratinocytes . Results generate proposal form foundation fully power clinical trial effect PLE risk AKs KCs . The result may also provide information promise dietary supplement may provide extra protection high-risk skin cancer population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Polypodium Leucotomos Preventing Skin Cancer Its Precursors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polypodium leucotomos tropical fern , extract show photoprotective effect animal human model , currently available over-the-counter dietary supplement . Polypodium leucotomos extract ( PLE ) show laboratory , animal , clinical study serve potent antioxidant help mitigate UV-induced damage scavenge free radical reactive oxygen specie . Oral consumption PLE human study show significantly reduce number UV-induced sunburn cell DNA damage , inhibit photosensitization . Importantly , PLE appear exceptionally well-tolerated serious report adverse side effect . PLE study numerous trial many condition , include skin disease . Doses 1200 mg per day use clinical study , though dos prevention sun-damage typically range 480 mg per day . To date , serious adverse effect clearly attribute use PLE ( high tolerability one reason great interest clinical use PLE ) . Oral consumption fern specie , Polypodium vulgare , associate low blood pressure increase heart rate . On theoretical ground , similar side effect may possible PLE .</detailed_description>
