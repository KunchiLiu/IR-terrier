	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) correspond group inherit disorder clinical manifestation result biochemical consequence single-base substitution valine glutamic acid position 6 ß-hemoglobin ( Hb ) subunit ( HbA [ ß6val ] HbS [ ß6glu ] ) . When oxygen tension low , solubility HbS fall molecule polymerize . In turn , intracellular formation HbS polymer result red blood cell ( RBC ) sickling . The aggregation sickle cell responsible vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOCs ) characterize SCD . Thanks improvement management SCD patient , 95 % affected infant survive adulthood . Pregnancy high-risk situation woman sickle cell disease , especially third trimester , delivery post-partum period . Conversely sickle cell disease lead pregnancy complication mother fetus since maternal-fetal mortality remain elevated . RBC transfusion careful prevention infection represent available treatment situation . The complexity set associate therapeutic strategy accentuate high frequency post-transfusion side effect SCD pregnancy , indirectly affect newborn induce hypoxia , may ultimately prevent woman receive transfusion ( RCOG , 2015 ) ( Tuck et al , 1983 ) . Post-transfusion complication constitute negative prognostic factor affect mother 's health fetal development thus increase risk premature death . Another factor complicate outcome pregnancy increase oxygen demand order satisfy increase metabolic requirement placenta fetus . As maternal oxygen reserve compromise pregnancy several reason ( increase oxygen consumption , SCD relate anemia accentuate plasmatic increase ) , patient particularly susceptible hypoxemia - leading exacerbation sickling event SCD-related complication . ( Hill &amp; Pickinpaugh , 2008 ) ( Thame et al , 2007 ) ( Rathod et al , 2007a ) ( Cines et al , 1998 ) ( Hassell , 2005 ) ( Pantanowitz et al , 2000 ) ( Rathod et al , 2007b ) Moving observation , first innovative approach introduce widespread use prophylactic oxygen treatment home . The rationale behind change come experiment murine model SCD mouse , high-oxygen environment pregnancy associate low prenatal fetal/maternal mortality rate ( Ye et al , 2008 ) . The absence severe complication also notice woman could transfuse ( severe alloimmunization ) already receive oxygen therapy home pregnancy . Then preliminary retrospective study perform evaluate clinical benefit widespread use prophylactic oxygen treatment home . It indicate innovative treatment safe seem associate significant decrease transfusion rate SCD patient pregnancy . These finding encouraging , preliminary bias take account . These result confirm randomized trial . The project aim assess preventive oxygen therapy impact woman sickle cell disease , fetal newborn . Firstly , investigator want assess preventive home-based oxygen therapy efficacy prevent vaso-occlusive complication last 24 hour require hospitalization . Secondly , want assess oxygen therapy impact prevention characteristic obstetrical complication , prevention neonatal complication , fetal newborn 's characteristic , type medical care , transfusion balance sheet , way transfusion maternal , fetal newborn tolerability home-based oxygen therapy pregnancy . For propose analyze 200 pregnant SCD woman . 100 woman first arm standard medical care . 100 woman second arm home-based oxygen therapy early night . This study perform 9 French hospital . Blood sample SCD woman blood cord drawn monitor red cell adherence protein expression function mechanic adhesive property .</detailed_description>
