	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter study assess extent pattern [ 18F ] flutemetamol uptake brain 3 group Japanese subject : HV , aMCI , pAD , assess reproducibility brain uptake image interpretation . The 3 comparison group ( HV , aMCI , pAD ) define subject ' main clinical diagnosis study entry . Subjects underwent diagnostic quality anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , follow open-label intravenous ( i.v . ) administration Flutemetamol F 18 Injection PET image brain . Blinded visual image read perform 10 independent board-certified reader ( 5 Japanese 5 non-Japanese ) nuclear medicine image interpretation experience . The blinded visual assessment compare subject 's clinical diagnosis , agreement image interpretation make 2 group reader ( Japanese non-Japanese ) determine . Blinded visual assessment also compare quantitative image assessment ( SUVRs ) . Inter-reader intra-reader agreement also assess . Test-retest variability evaluate follow second administration Flutemetamol F 18 Injection give subset ( N = 5 ) pAD subject 1 4 week first administration Flutemetamol F 18 Injection .</detailed_description>
