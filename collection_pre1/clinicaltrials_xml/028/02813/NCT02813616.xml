	<brief_title>Factors Affecting Dissatisfaction Treatments Patients With Chronic Constipation IBS With Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Chronic constipation ( CC ) Irritable Bowel Syndrome Constipation ( IBS-C ) two overlap condition patient dissatisfy bowel habit . In non negligible proportion patient , dissatisfaction persists first line treatment effective laxative macrogol bisacodyl . Prucalopride linaclotide two relatively new treatment use condition . Prucalopride prokinetic drug license patient CC responsive standard laxative treatment . Linaclotide guanylate cyclase-C agonist show improve abdominal pain bowel habit patient IBS-C . Despite new treatment , consistent number patient remain dissatisfied suggest complain `` refractory '' `` intractable '' form constipation . Both IBS-C CC disease define patient symptom , well lack response treatment . The Patient Assessment Constipation-Symptoms ( PAC-SYM ) validate self-report questionnaire able ass time general constipation severity cluster symptom specific condition indicate patient perspective disorder . Some limitation performance questionnaire however emerge recently demonstrate Modified version PAC-SYM ( M : PAC-SYM ) good tool assess constipation severity patient recruit tertiary referral centre . A change &gt; 0.24 M : PAC-SYM score show define whether response treatment adequate , variation persists long term yet investigate . Several factor may influence lack response treatment . Stool characteristic , psychological alteration ( somatisation ) , delay colonic transit increase rest anal pressure may influence constipation severity , relative role factor still unknown . On hand bowel frequency , commonly believe reflect constipation , seem play major role . Aims : The purpose study perform pool analysis multiple prospective treatment optimization N-of-1 trial patient IBS-C CC aim : 1 ) define many patient achieve sustain improvement ; 2 ) define factor associate sustained improvement ; 3 ) evaluate suitability M : PAC-SYM treatment optimization among patient CC IBS-C 4 ) ass longitudinal follow natural history IBS-C CC submit standardised treatment . Study design : All patient age 18 - 80 year old IBS-C CC include observational multicentric national study . Patients secondary cause CC exclude . The diagnosis CC IBS-C define accord Rome III criterion . All patient undergo thorough clinical examination include rectal examination search anatomical functional defect . Dietary advice supplementation soluble fibre patient report insufficient dietary fibre intake give . Basic principle defecation give patient particular dyssynergic behaviour straining . The following item record enrolment : 1 ) demographic data ; 2 ) clinical history include pregnancy anorectal surgery ; 3 ) cause secondary constipation ( TSH calcium level , ultrasonography colonoscopy necessary ) ; 4 ) rectal examination ( anal pressure rest puborectalis relaxation simulate evacuation ) ; 5 ) ongoing therapy ; 6 ) `` satisfaction '' current therapy ( record two item : 1-7 point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) -7 +7 VAS ; 7 ) M : PAC-SYM ; 8 ) Somatisation ( Short Form-12 ( SF-12 ) include 12 question Symptom Checklist-90 Revised ( SCL-90-R ) somatisation score ) ; 9 ) quality life ( SF36 , validate questionnaire evaluate patient ' perception functional impairment eight subscales give rise two composite score assess perceive physical mental health ) ; 10 ) colonic transit time ( record accord Metcalf et al , laxatives maintain usual diet . Patients ingest 20 radio-opaque marker 9 three consecutive day abdominal X ray obtain 9 fourth day . Colonic transit time calculate number retain marker x 1.2 ; 11 ) anal resting pressure ( anal pressure ( mmHg ) record rest condition ten minute measure average last 30 second pressure record channel high pressure ) . Enrolled patient direct one-month therapy macrogol ( 17-34 mg per day ) need bisacodyl ( 5-10 mg per day ) ± bowel enema . Optimization frequency laxative dose titration encourage . During month , patient fill daily diary ask bowel habit ( stool frequency consistency ) , abdominal pain , straining , incomplete evacuation urgency . After one-month therapy ( T1 ) patient admitted outpatient service follow visit `` satisfaction '' current therapy ( record two item : 1-7 point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) -7 +7 VAS ) M : PAC-SYM record . Satisfied patient ( satisfaction score &gt; 4 ) invite continue therapy . Unsatisfied partially satisfied patient ( satisfaction score≤4 ) diagnosis CC direct one-month therapy prucalopride 2 mg per day . Unsatisfied partially satisfied patient ( satisfaction score≤4 ) diagnosis IBS-C direct one-month therapy linaclotide 290 mcg per day . When necessary , patient CC IBS-C allow take bisacodyl ( max 2 tablet day , 5 mg ) otilonium bromide ( max 2 tablet day , 40 mg ) . As first month therapy , patient fill daily diary ask bowel habit ( stool frequency consistency accord 1-7 Bristol score ) , abdominal pain ( 0-10 ) , strain , incomplete evacuation urgency . After one month therapy patient evaluate first follow-up visit ( see T1 ) . Patients repeat one month previous treatment satisfy switched treatment one month , repeat satisfied . Statistical analysis A pool analysis perform patient achieve sustained improvement fail achieve improvement three treatment option . Clinical demographic information , along self-reported outcome abstract clinical chart daily diary . The analytic dataset include follow variable : Socio-demographics ( age , gender , education , employment status ) ; Clinical history ( comorbidities , abdominal extra-abdominal surgery , concurrent medication , previous pregnancy , life-style , dietary habit ongoing therapy ) ; Results rectal examination ; Psychological Profile ( SF-12 ) ; Quality life ( SF36 ) ; Colonic transit time ; Anal resting pressure ; `` satisfaction '' current therapy ( record two item : 1-7 point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) -7 +7 VAS ) M : PAC-SYM ; bowel habit ( stool frequency consistency ) , severity abdominal pain , straining , incomplete evacuation urgency/month . Data report absolute relative frequency mean standard deviation discrete continuous variable respectively . Agreement responder status define treatment satisfaction score M-PAC-SYM change assess K coefficient assessment time-point . The investigator calculate variance partition coefficient random-intercept hierarchical logistic model ( level 1 : study time-period ; level 2 : patient ) order evaluate proportion variance explain treatment-related vs patient-related factor likelihood treatment response ( change satisfaction &gt; 2 ) . Such model would allow account auto-correlation observation within patient . Treatment modality accommodate time-varying covariates indicate active/inactive treatment study period . If variance partition coefficient suggest significant share variance likelihood treatment response explain patient-related factor , socio-demographic , clinical , psychological physiological patient-related factor include model . In order assess role constipation-related symptom drive patient global satisfaction treatment , investigator specify two additional model . In first additional model , M : ABD M : STO subscale score M : PAC-SYM questionnaire include model treatment response likelihood time-varying covariate . In second specification M : PAC-SYM item include simultaneously time-varying covariates . Power calculation relative key analysis plan study : 1 . Impact somatization quality life treatment response likelihood ( change satisfaction &gt; 2 ) : A sample 82 patient complete least 4 assessment would achieve 80 % power detect f=0,25 effect size difference treatment response likelihood patient diagnosed somatization disorder , base establish SCL-90-R cut-off . 2 . Impact constipation-related symptom treatment response likelihood ( satisfaction &gt; 2 ) : A sample 38 patient complete least 4 assessment would achieve 80 % power detect f=0,25 effect size difference treatment response likelihood patient report constipation-related symptom ( absent-mild symptom v moderate-severe PAC-SYM item ) Bonferroni correction multiple test ( correct alpha= 0.0045455 ) . According power calculation plan reach sample size 90 patient achieve sustained response dissatisfy proposed treatment .</detailed_description>
