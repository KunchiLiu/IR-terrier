	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) major health problem diagnosis remain challenge emergency physician . The management suspect ACS well codify , base troponin assay , renew necessary . Conversely , criterion lead initiate diagnostic procedure chest pain Emergency department unclear . The fear , firstly , miss potentially life treat diagnosis , secondly , expose many patient unnecessary examination . The advent highly sensitive troponin assay also increase risk over-investigation large number elevation biomarker non-coronary circumstance lead prolongation hospitalization , possibly , unnecessary treatment invasive investigation . CARE rule could help streamline first step . It establish assign value 0 2 item : Characteristic pain , Age , Risk factor ECG . The search ACS justify sum point ≤1 ( negative rule ) , conversely , troponin perform sum &gt; 1 ( positive rule ) . Indeed , CARE rule corresponds first 4 item HEART score ( latter stand troponin admission ) whose reliability demonstrate , ≤3 income exclude ACS risk false negative &lt; 2 % . A negative CARE rule always correspond HEART score ≤3 . Our study aim confirm interest CARE rule streamline search ACS chest pain observational European multicenter prospective study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interest CARE Rule Exclude Hypothesis Acute Coronary Syndrome Without Bioassay - ICARE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CARE rule evaluate prospective study routine care 641 patient among 9.8 % Major Adverse Cardiac Event ( MACE ) . 200 patient ( 31 % ) negative rule none show MACE 45-day follow-up ( 0 % [ 0-1.9 ] ) . Among 200 patient , 119 standard troponin assay , single dosage increase . The main objective demonstrate reliability CARE rule exclude ACS chest pain , use observational Franco-Belgian multicenter study routine care . If reliability CARE rule confirm Emergency department , could evaluate used circumstance pre-hospital private practice general practitioner cardiologist . In summary , ICARE study intend allow rationalization management patient chest pain , limit use unnecessary investigation ensure safety care .</detailed_description>
