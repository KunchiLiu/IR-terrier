	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn blood glucose control people Type 1 Diabetes switch insulin pump . The investigator hope learn whether use continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) help create personalized insulin dos may lead stable blood glucose less frequent insulin pump dose change transition insulin pump .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continue Glucose Monitoring Before Insulin Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize control study . Participants ask wear Medtronic iPro2 continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) 1-2 week prior start insulin pump therapy . Depending randomization group , participant either CGM data use inform start insulin pump dos ( treatment group ) , standard care start insulin pump ( control group ) . Participants wear CGM first 5 day pump start approximately 6 week pump start , order collect blood glucose data . Each time CGM worn , blood glucose must check 6-8 time daily , write log must complete . Baseline medical information also collect start participation . Participants also ask complete questionnaire approximately 6 week pump start . Participation study complete standard care follow visit approximately 3 month pump start .</detailed_description>
