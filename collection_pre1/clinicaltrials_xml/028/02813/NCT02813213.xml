	<brief_summary>This double-blind randomized control clinical trial , compare percentage epithelialization skin defect use conventional meshed split thickness skin graft vs skin micro graft . Two technique apply patient . The skin defect divide two part , randomize method half defect assign one two technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Comparison Skin Micro-grafts v Meshed Split Thickness Skin Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Split thickness skin graft standard technique skin defect reconstruction . The etiology problem diverse ( burn , infection , trauma , cancer ) however , many time availability donor area insufficient morbidity complication may arise make prohibitive use technique many situation . Skin micro graft technique consist use small part skin ( 0.8x 0.8 mm ) keratinocyte growth-factor solution allow 1:50- 1:100 skin expansion . It many advantage : perform local anesthesia donor area tiny . The study consist use conventional new technique patient . The skin defect divide two part , randomize method half defect assign one two different technique . The result variable `` percentage epithelialization '' compare two half . This variable measure day 14 use clinical image software method . The patient investigator record outcome variable blind type technique . The investigator take skin biopsy two half perform pathology study .</detailed_description>
