	<brief_summary>This study help investigator design method detect disease-causing immune cell patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Such method currently available , successful , would help scientist good understand cause RA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Pathological Lymphocytes Patients With Autoimmune Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator interested learn immune cell blood contribute disease patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . They develop method identify specific type immune cell react normal tissue body . In study , investigator enroll RA patient University Minnesota clinic , collect blood sample enrol patient , process blood sample isolate DNA , RNA , serum , blood cell . They use serum detect whether specific autoantibody ( Anti-cyclic Citrullinated Peptide , anti-CCP ) present . In case anti-CCP antibody detect , investigator may quantify number immune cell present contain receptor anti-CCP specificity . They may also test whether number immune cell receptor correlate measure disease activity RA patient .</detailed_description>
