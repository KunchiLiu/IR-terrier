	<detailed_description>Background BlueStar smart-phone enable application design serve virtual coach patient . The app sends daily evidence-based , real-time message well longitudinal feedback improve diabetes management . Benefits demonstrate time period brief three month . One US base study show decrease hospitalization emergency department visit among participant use application . The BlueStar application first application USA give FDA approval Mobile Prescription Therapy . There need explore effectiveness , utility cost intervention context Canadian healthcare , scale across system . This study base model `` integrated knowledge translation '' , knowledge user study central development research project begin . By use integrate knowledge translation strategy , study far likely demonstrate impact health system policy decision-making . Research Objective : The primary objective determine smart-phone base application design improve diabetes self-management experience care among patient Type II diabetes improves clinical outcome , patient experience health system cost compare control group . Study Hypothesis : Patients randomize receive BlueStar application improve HbA1c level compare control group . The intervention group also show improved self-reported outcome relate quality life , disease self-management experience care . The intervention also reduce episode self-reported hypoglycemia . Intervention : As part intervention , patient give Samsung Smart phone BlueStar application pre-loaded . Participants able interact application study period however would like . They enter range baseline clinical information . They also able enter ongoing information relate diabetes management include blood glucose value , food intake activity level . Based information , BlueStar system attempt improve diabetes management two process . First , app provide customized , real-time , evidence base message impact motivation , behavior education . The messaging base Trans Theoretical Model Behavior Change , incorporate motivation , education affirmation create sustain behavior change positive health . The app also contain library video patient access time include information healthy eating , complication unmanaged diabetes use glucometer . Second , application facilitates transfer data clinician Smart Visit report provide clinical overview diabetes include recent blood sugar reading . The app remind participant print document bring clinical appointment every 3 month . However , advise clinician , participant print smart report frequently send via fax clinician . This may require example rapid titration insulin close monitoring blood sugar require . Throughout study participant able contact usual clinician diabetes education center question application information present . If clinician unable answer question clear protocol triage question ( OTN IT support , PI etc. ) . Study Design : The study randomize , wait-list-control trial 300 participant . The outcome assessor blind group allocation compare impact BlueStar application usual care . Participants randomize one two group : immediate treatment group ( ITG ) wait-list-control ( WLC ) . The ITG group immediately begin use application , total duration six month . The WLC receive usual care first three month , point cross intervention arm use application total 3 month . Recruitment : Participants recruit three institution across Ontario , Canada 3 month period . The site include Diabetes Health Center Thunder Bay , Diabetes Education Center North York General Hospital , Diabetes Education Centers belong William Osler Health System Brampton Etobicoke , Ontario . These site serve diverse range patient diabetes complex health social care need , represent wide range population Ontario , include large population aboriginal people new immigrant . Patients typically follow clinic appointment every 3 month . Baseline Information : The follow information collect baseline participant : 1 . HbA1c : Patients require HbA1c value within 2 week enrollment date . 2 . Baseline characteristic : Baseline information include demographic health status collect use case report form ( CRF ) . 3 . Standardized patient-reported outcome measure ( PROMs ) /patient-reported experience measure ( PREMs ) : A set standardize questionnaire relate study hypothesis . 4 . Patient report health outcome utilization Data Management : All data generate participant BlueStar application store OTN 's highly secure , Toronto base data center . Utilization data generate BlueStar application also store OTN data center . Management additional research data multi-center study centrally coordinate Applied Health Research Centre ( AHRC ) , not-for-profit academic research organization St. Michael 's Hospital Toronto , Canada . The AHRC create host secure , web-based data entry system , use REDCapâ„¢ software . Research assistants enter clinical data outcome REDCap database , administer patient survey tool . AHRC determine randomization sequence . Data quality completeness monitor weekly basis AHRC data manager throughout data collection period , 6 month randomization . Healthcare utilization cost outcome measure obtain health administrative data available Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) . At time study enrollment , patient ask provide consent link Ontario Health Insurance Plan ( OHIP ) number health administrative data . This data use determine frequency intensity healthcare utilization overall individual cost use method develop use Ontario data . Data Analyses : All analysis intention treat . Qualitative Realist Evaluation - Background : In order understand contextual influence practical process BlueStar application implement practice , investigator use method qualitative Realist Evaluation . Realist Evaluation methodology use `` unpack black box implementation '' , examine actual action require involved implementation ensure BlueStar application take used patient , caregiver , health care provider involve . This methodology enable rigorous assessment contextual influence strategy application adopt reject , enable researcher understand implementation succeed fails . Objectives : The objective qualitative realist evaluation component study ( ) understand BlueStar application implement practice , ( b ) explore participant ' perspective usability acceptability BlueStar application , ( c ) examine key issue associate scale application BlueStar across Ontario . Methods : The Realist Evaluation occur alongside pragmatic randomize trial describe , include two key method . The first qualitative interview key stakeholder involve implementation process , second observation introduction use virtual care intervention among participant . Specifically , qualitative interview conduct participant implementation site . Participants recruit interview include 4 6 patient site ( caregiver invite participate interview well ) ; 3 5 health care provider involve implementation process site ( include least one physician location ) ; 2-4 organizational leader oversee implementation process site ( example , Diabetes Education Centre Managers ) ; 5-7 health system decision maker involve implementation virtual care initiative Ontario ( example , Local Health Integration Network leader , Ministry Health Long Term Care staff OTN leader ) . Qualitative interview include question ( ) participant ' experience learn use technology ; ( b ) change health care provider workflow require effectively use technology ; ( c ) organizational change require support technology ; ( ) health system barrier facilitator effective implementation evaluation . These qualitative interview audio record transcribed verbatim , analyze use thematic analysis strategy investigator team identify key theme related implementation evaluation virtual care initiative actual context health care delivery Ontario . Observations qualitative method study involve researcher sit Health Care Provider ( HCP ) education session ( led application service provider ) Blue Star application introduce 2 site . The researcher take detailed note regard technology introduce HCPs , question raise HCPs , general observation around initial perception technology . Where possible , researcher take note HCP interact technology understand capability .</detailed_description>
