	<brief_summary>The aim study understand epigenetic transcriptomic mechanism regulate fetal origin adult disease ( FOAD ) , either presence metabolic disorder future mother , obesity exposure certain contaminant tobacco . To , miRNAs profile secrete endometrial fluid obese woman vs normoweight woman window implantation identify . Likewise , study miRNA signature normalize substantial loss weight produce patient involve studied . In parallel , comparison miRNA expression profile secrete endometrial fluid smoker woman vs nonsmoker woman perform . As previous case , study exposure contaminant , normalization miRNA expression signature occur . Finally , silico analysis carry order define target gene metabolic pathway affect miRNAs profile secrete pathological condition</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal Transcriptomic Regulation Preimplantation Embryo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The developmental origin adult disease recognize related intrauterine condition embryonic fetal life . Pregnancy begin embryo implantation impact adult life remain unknown . It demonstrate human endometrial epithelium secrete specific microRNAs ( miRNAs ) time frame embryo enters uterine cavity initiate adhesion uterine wall . Maternal miRNAs secrete endometrial fluid , transport exosomes bound protein consequently uptaken preimplantation embryo , implantation occurs . As consequence suffer transcriptomic modification induce profound molecular functional change . The data already publish demonstrate novel paradigm : transcriptomic maternal endometrial regulation pre-implantation embryo health . Here , novel maternal endometrium-based mechanism apply order understand prevent developmental origin adult disease induce embryonic implantation either metabolic disorder future mother develop obesity exposure certain contaminant tobacco . In project , expression profile secrete miRNAs identify endometrial fluid obese woman compare normo-weight woman . Also , study `` obese '' endometrial miRNA pattern reverse weight-loss . In parallel , murine model obesity use proof concept . In addition , expression profile secrete endometrial miRNAs identify smoker versus future non-smokers mother . As previous case , reversion signature analyse stop exposure contaminant . Then , `` silico '' analysis do select putative gene functional pathway target signature secrete endometrial miRNAs human murine model pathological condition . The determination transcriptomic and/or epigenome modification induce `` obese '' or/and `` smoker '' endometrial miRNAs preimplantation mouse embryo expect . As preliminary result , support project accept model transcriptomic maternal endometrial regulation pre-implantation embryo health , identification differential pattern secrete miRNAs endometrial fluid obese woman compare normo-weight counterpart present . In consequence , application novel endometrium-based mechanism understand prevention origin adult disease related obesity and/or tobacco exposure propose .</detailed_description>
