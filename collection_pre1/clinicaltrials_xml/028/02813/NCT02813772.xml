	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Definition Infantile Colic ( IC ) one Functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGIDs ) infants/toddlers , define variable combination chronic recurrent gastrointestinal symptom explain structural biochemical abnormality . In 2006 , Rome III committee establish new criterion define `` episodes irritability , fussing , cry begin end apparent reason last least three hour day , least three day week , least one week '' . Epidemiology IC responsible 25 % pediatric consultation first 3-4 month life affect 5 % 30 % infant 2 week 3 month life . The variability prevalence IC report several study depend different criterion use define IC . In systematic review 15 community-based survey IC prevalence , carry 2001 , occurrence rate first 3 month life 3 % 28 % prospective study 8 % 40 % retrospective study . In prospective study find 20.5 % 2879 Italian infant , age 2 weeks-6 month , IC . Recently French study report prevalence IC infant age 0-4 month , 19 % . In two english study , IC report 18.3 % 26 % respectively , infant age 0-12 month . Other European study conduct different report prevalence . Outside Europe , prevalence 9.2 % 20 % respectively report two study carry US . More recently Israeli study 94 mother 2-4 moths life infant , 56 % whose baby breastfed 73 % use formula report `` paroxysmal irritability '' . In addition , several study find occurrence rate crying/fussing problem young infant range 7 % 19 % , without define problem IC . Pathogenesis The etiology IC remain still unclear . Gender , type milk ( breast-milk formula ) , delivery modality ( vaginally caesarean ) , mother age , number sibling gestational history seem correlate IC onset . Gastrointestinal function , psychosocial , neurodevelopmental disorder , food intolerance , transient low lactase activity , cow 's milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) , gastro-esophageal reflux ( GER ) intestinal microbiota imbalance suggest cause colic . Gastrointestinal theory include increase intra-abdominal gas , hyperperistalsis visceral pain . Gastrointestinal disorder implicate colic infant 's leg position grimace cry episode . Excessive cry increase gas production colon function result intraluminal gas formation aerophagia , even radiographic image take cry episode show normal gastric outline . One study suggest infant colic may increase fecal calprotectin level , suggest possible role gut inflammation ; however , another study suggest difference fecal calprotectin level infant infant without colic . Gut hormone , motilin , also may play causative role colic . Motilin think cause hyperperistalsis , lead abdominal pain colic . Regarding psychosocial hypothesis , maternal anxiety depression , difficult infant temperament correlate IC . Also behavioral issue family tension inadequate interaction parent infant consider , issue really controversial . Concomitant risk factor remain partially unknown ; however , maternal smoking , increase maternal age firstborn status may associate development IC . The role intestinal microbiome Infantile Colic Recently , composition intestinal microbiome address independent risk factor IC . Several study indicate inadequate lactobacillus first month life may affect intestinal fatty acid profile favor development IC . Coliform bacteria also find abundantly colicky infant speculate alter intestinal microbiota composition may positively influence management affected infant . As matter fact , recently , research use probiotic colic rapidly increase result conflict . Infants colic report increased concentration gas form organisms proteobacteria Escherichia coli gut . Colonization certain intestinal microorganism , Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus specie , along increase intestinal microbial diversity , may protect infant distress . Probiotics enhance mucosal barrier promote microbial diversity gut . They may reduce concentration proteobacteria gas form coliform reduce intestinal inflammation . One clinical trial show safety efficacy Lactobacillus reuteri prevention IC . A recent meta-analysis three small , randomize controlled trial , breast-fed infant IC report Lactobacillus reuteri noticeably reduce crying time 21 day post supplementation . Recently Chau et al show administration Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 significantly improve colic symptom reduce cry fuss time breastfed Canadian infant colic . In contrast , double blind , placebo control randomized trial probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 show benefit community sample breast-fed infant formula-fed infant IC . The role diet Infant colic There uniform criterion specific therapeutic approach IC . Regarding dietary modification management IC , current evidence suggests may reduce IC small minority infant . Unfortunately , evidence often contrast . For breast-fed infant IC , relatively rare concern cow 's milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) , one consider eliminate cow 's milk maternal diet minimum two week . For formula-fed infant colic , use time-limited ( two week ) empiric trial extensively hydrolyze formula may consider . However information derive study highly select patient tertiary care level center . In double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , partial hydrolyze , high β-palmitate , specific prebiotics mixture galacto- fructo-oligosaccharides result significant decrease colic within one week intervention . In case , formulas lactose-reduced lactose-free contain prebiotics probiotic cause reduction number cry episode per week total cry time . Infante et al show association clinical improvement evidence decrease level hydrogen IC infant feed specially design , low-lactose formula . Moreover , two double-blinded crossover trial , lactase treatment reduce crying time compare placebo . The use soy formula , instead , treatment IC avoid since induce sensitization soy 's high isoflavones estradiol-like effect . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : -To determine whether administration partially hydrolyze formula ( pHF ) reduce lactose content Lactobacillus reuteri , beneficial IC reduce infant cry duration . Secondary objective : - To evaluate effect partially hydrolyze formula ( pHF ) reduce lactose content Lactobacillus reuteri prolong duration sleep period . - To evaluate effect infant formula enrich Lactobacillus reuteri fecal microbiome colicky infant - To evaluate effect infant formula enrich Lactobacillus reuteri parent ' quality life - To evaluate effect infant formula enrich Lactobacillus reuteri infant ' quality life METHODS Study design - This prospective , double-blind , randomized-controlled , clinical trial . - The study aim compare infant colic 's trend intestinal microbiome infant feed partially hydrolyze formula ( pHF ; 100 % whey protein ; 1.9g/100 kcal ) reduce lactose content ( 40 % ) , addition maltodextrins ( 60 % ) Lactobacillus reuteri ( NAN Sensitive , Nestlè ) ( group 1 ) infant feed intact protein body formula ( 70 % whey protein , 30 % casein ; 1.85g/100 kcal ) 100 % lactose content contain Lactobacillus reuteri ( NAN Optipro 1 , Nestlè ) ( group 2 ) . - Subjects enrol consecutively randomize one 2 study group .</detailed_description>
