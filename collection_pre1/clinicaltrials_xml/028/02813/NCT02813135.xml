	<brief_summary>The first molecular profiling protocol launch Europe ( MOSCATO-01 ( Geoerger 2014 ) , MAPPYACTS , INFORM , iTHER , SM-PAEDS , etc . ) determine multiple actionable alteration pediatric recurrent cancer . Increasingly , stratify approach implement enrich clinical trial molecularly target agent possibly improve outcome specific population i.e . molecularly enriched/predictive biomarker-driven approach . The diversity heterogeneity detect molecular alteration low number pediatric patient mandate adapt , innovative trial design attribute treatment option order satisfy current unmet medical need . This basket trial design cover target several survival pathway oncogenesis currently adequately employ pediatric patient Europe .</brief_summary>
