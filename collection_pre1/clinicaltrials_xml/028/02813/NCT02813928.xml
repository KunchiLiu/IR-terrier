	<brief_summary>Inspite curative treatment 30-50 % patient ColoRectal Cancer ( CRC ) develop tumor relapse first 3 year treatment primary tumor . Treatment relapse base surgical resection , possible , chemotherapy target therapy . To detect recurrence metastasis , surveillance strategy recommend patient able withstand complementary treatment five-year period . Over period , probability one false-positive result 87 % . Considering le 10 % recurrent patient suitable potentially curative treatment intensive program enable increase overall rate curative resection result reduce mortality , less time cost-consuming , tailor follow-up necessary . The level circulate ccfDNA , define extra cellular DNA , increase CRC patient . The Inplex® method could validate use ccfDNA cancer biomarker term prognosis surveillance . Tubes ccfDNA analysis take medical examination time CEA dosage ( make consultation ) . Cryotubes plasma send analysis laboratory INSERM ( National Health Institute ) Montpellier remain plasma keep biological collection . Patients consultation follow-up every 3-4 month dosage CEA ccfDNA realize well medical examination , general examination ( weight , size , blood pressure ) , evaluation index performance status nutritional evaluation case loss weight .</brief_summary>
