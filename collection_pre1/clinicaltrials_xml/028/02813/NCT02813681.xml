	<brief_summary>Historically , woman chronic back pain pregnancy attribute cause epidural procedure . While many study show great incidence generalize post-partum back pain receive epidural , study measure localized pressure sensitivity epidural insertion site . Short-term pressure sensitivity might limit patient 's mobility activity post-partum period . Understanding factor increase insertion site pressure sensitivity allow investigator modify epidural placement technique order minimize effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Landmark Epidural Site Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few study examine epidural placement change localize sensation epidural insertion site . This study first study quantitatively measure sensation epidural insertion site . The investigator ass localized pressure sensitivity algometer . An algometer hand-held device commonly use neurologist detect sensory deficit measure pressure sensitivity threshold 1-cm diameter circular area . Ultrasound ( US ) pre-procedural examination provide accurate landmark placement epidural catheter . The investigator determine US examination prior epidural placement reduces localize pressure sensitivity . The investigator also determine correlation participant characteristic and/or comorbidities increase pressure sensitivity insertion site .</detailed_description>
