	<brief_summary>Temperature-controlled Laminar Airflow ( TLA ) treatment deliver Airsonett treatment device new treatment patient allergic asthma . The LASER Trial ( temperature-controlled Laminar Airflow Severe asthma Exacerbation Reduction - LASER ) trial , currently evaluate whether Airsonett device able reduce frequency asthma attack patient allergic asthma . ( www.lasertrial.co.uk ) Participants successfully complete least 6 month follow-up LASER trial eligible post trial provision 4 year active TLA treatment device . To date long term performance data available show whether sustained benefit long term use Airsonett device , whether improvement asthma control quality life maintain whether patient continue use treatment device beyond 12 month ( length longest previous trial TLA treatment . ) The investigator plan assess performance Airsonett device record frequency asthma attack patient 4-year period ( 48 month . ) The investigator also wish evaluate effect long term TLA treatment asthma control , quality life , healthcare resource use patient acceptability long term use Airsonett device . Participants send ask complete series questionnaires 6 monthly basis 48 month study period . Questionnaires return post single study centre base Portsmouth , UK . Participants also contact telephone 6 monthly basis member trial team collect information medication , healthcare resource use whether asthma attack since last contact . Participants expect visit study centre trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laminar Airflow Severe Asthma Exacerbation Reduction - 48 Month Follow-up .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma affect 5.4 million people UK nearly 500,00 experience severe symptom frequent exacerbation inadequately control available treatment . The burden severe asthma NHS enormous accounting 80 % total asthma cost . In 2009 1131 death due asthma , whose asthma remain poorly-controlled face great risk . Patients severe asthma bear great burden asthma morbidity experience frequent severe exacerbation reduce quality life , impair ability work place enormous burden anxiety family . There also increase risk significant depression . 1 5 asthmatic UK report serious concern next asthma attack kill . As highlighted 2010 Asthma UK report , 'Fighting Breath , ' patient also face discrimination employer , healthcare professional society whole result asthma . Current treatment include oral corticosteroid , 'steroid-sparing ' immunosuppressant monoclonal antibody therapy often limit efficacy potentially serious side effect ( steroid , immunosuppressive agent ) prohibitively expensive ( monoclonal antibody ) . The adverse effect long-term oral steroid include adrenal suppression , decrease bone mineral density , diabetes increase cardiovascular mortality . The anti-IgE treatment Omalizumab® show reduce exacerbation 50 % improve quality life severe allergic asthma cost £26,640 per year , substantially current annual rental cost TLA device ( £2,088 ) . Patients poorly control , severe , allergic asthma leave significant unmet clinical need specific requirement cost-effective therapy reduce systemic steroid exposure reduce frequency severe exacerbation . The Department Health Outcomes Strategy COPD Asthma ( 2011 ) recognise huge burden poorly-controlled asthma place people 's life NHS , spell political commitment improve asthma control reduce asthma related emergency healthcare need death . The 2013 British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) national asthma guideline 2010 WHO consultation severe asthma highlight urgent need research severe asthma , acknowledge limitation available treatment severe asthma dearth clinical trial upon base management recommendation . Asthma UK emphasise research strategy 2012 document new therapy able reduce symptom prevent exacerbation improve clinical outcome patient well-being reduce cost treat severe asthma within NHS . More 70 % severe asthmatic patient sensitise common aeroallergens and/or mould level allergen exposure determine symptom ; expose high allergen level increase risk exacerbation hospital admission . Domestic exposure allergen also know act synergistically virus sensitise patient increase risk severity exacerbation . Allergen avoidance widely recognise logical way treat patient . In controlled condition , long-term allergen avoidance sensitise asthmatic reduces airway inflammation consequent symptomatic improvement , support high-altitude , clean-air study . Unfortunately , effective method allergen reduction prove elusive , current measure unable reduce allergen load sufficiently yield consistent clinical improvement , thus leave significant gap potential strategy reduce asthma severity allergen reduction . At night airborne particle carry persistent convection current establish warm body , transport allergen bed area breathe zone . Proof-of-concept study show TLA device reduces total number airborne particle &gt; 0.5μm breathe zone 3000-fold ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , cat allergen exposure 7-fold ( p=0.043 ) significantly reduce increase particle generate turn bed particle size . When compare best class traditional air cleaner TLA able reduce exposure potential allergen 99 % 30 . We postulate highly significant reduction nocturnal exposure , target breathe zone , explain TLA may succeed area many measure , include air filter , fail . The TLA device compare placebo , proven efficacy asthma-related quality life bronchial inflammation ( measure exhale nitric oxide ) pan European multicentre Phase III study , ( n=282 , age range 7-70 year ) . The great benefit see severe asthma patient require high intensity treatment ( GINA Steps 4-5 ) patient poorly control asthma ( Asthma Control Test &lt; 18 ) . GINA Steps 4-5 consistent BTS/SIGN Guideline treatment Steps 4-5 ( inhaled corticosteroid dose ≥1000µg/day beclomethasone ( BDP ) equivalent plus additional controller medication long act ß2-agonist , leukotriene receptor antagonist sustain release theophylline ) . Whilst power ascertain effect exacerbation , post-hoc analysis show decreased exacerbation rate severe patient treat TLA compare placebo trend towards significance ( mean 0.23 TLA ; 0.57 placebo p=0.07 ) . A cost-effectiveness analysis base result trial also find significant difference ED visit , hospitalisation day , medication usage , therefore overall cost two study group . This lack significant finding probably reflect fact trial power detect difference exacerbation , predictor increase asthma healthcare resource use cost . Despite lack significant reduction healthcare resource use associate cost , subsequent economic modelling show TLA would cost-effective Sweden current monthly rental price ( SEK 2,000 , ≈ £167 ) , mainly due increase quality life . In order address important research question severe allergic asthma , The LASER Trial , multi-centre , randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial currently assess whether nocturnal use TLA treatment device Airsonett® able reduce frequency severe asthma exacerbation patient poorly control , severe , allergic asthma . The LASER Trial receive funding National Institute Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme . In LASER Trial , participant receive 12 month treatment . Half participant receive active TLA device half receive device deactivate ( 'placebo ' device . ) Neither patient researcher know device individual participant receive . All participant complete least 6 month follow-up within LASER trial eligible treatment active TLA device 4 year regardless whether receive active placebo device trial . LASER-48 follow study The LASER Trial investigator ask participant continue report asthma attack symptoms 4 year ( 48-month ) follow-up period mean questionnaire monitor whether treatment device impact asthma symptom quality life . To reduce burden study participant , require visit hospital clinic follow-up appointment contact 6 monthly basis gather information asthma symptom , asthma medication whether required visit GP hospital asthma . Participants free withdraw study time without give reason . At end study last participant complete 48 month follow-up , data analyse help determine whether long term treatment TLA ( Airsonett ) device able reduce frequency asthma attack , improve asthma symptom , improve asthma relate quality life remain cost-effective acceptable treatment patient severe allergic asthma .</detailed_description>
