	<detailed_description>The primary aim study determine efficacy novel , high-intensity aerobic interval exercise precondition protocol ameliorate anthracycline-mediated cardiac skeletal muscle toxicity woman breast cancer undergo de novo chemotherapy . Research Design : Women breast cancer schedule undergo de novo chemotherapy anthracyclines enrol . Qualified patient randomize either 1 ) high-intensity interval exercise group , 2 ) attention-control group . Supervised exercise training carry Mayo Clinic Cardiac rehabilitation center Arizona cycle ergometer use Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) telemetry . Patients high-intensity interval exercise group perform four , 4-min interval 85-90 % peak heart rate ( PHR ) , separate 3 min 50 % PHR . Each training session begin 10-minute warm-up 50 % PHR end 5-min cool 50 % PHR . The attention-controls receive counsel consistent standard care regard physical activity chemotherapy . Attention-control group receive weekly phone call maintain physical activity chemotherapy compliance verify use physical activity diaries pedometer . Treatment group commence 1-week prior chemotherapy induction . The first dose chemotherapy give within 16-18 hour last bout exercise . High-intensity intermittent exercise ( HIIE ) training continue throughout four , 2-week cycle chemotherapy ( total training time = 9 week , 3 days/week ) .</detailed_description>
