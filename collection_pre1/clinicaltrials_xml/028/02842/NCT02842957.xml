	<brief_title>An Intensive Lifestyle Intervention Program CKD ( Move Health 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study advertise Renal Transplant Associates New England ( RTANE ) interest patient screen cleared nephrologists RTANE make sure contraindication exercise described American College Sports Medicine . Those patient eligible ( stage 3-4 , eGFRs 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2 ) participate , want involve , ask read sign consent form , review approve Institutional Review Board Springfield College . This sign take place RTANE prior come College . Individuals randomly assign either lifestyle intervention group usual care group . During course study , serum potassium level monitor monthly basis patient . For individual randomize intervention group , level great 5.2 mEq/L , patient prescribe Veltassa accord recommend dosing scheme . Individuals randomize usual care group care physicians receive current standard care . They able take Veltassa , prescribe physician , require study protocol . At baseline , month 6 , blood sample take potassium assessment , sample also use assessment biomarkers track study ( e.g. , phosphorus , inflammatory marker , etc ) After 6 month participation study , individual retested protocol use baseline . Pretest instruction : Following sign consent form , patient give instruction complete 3-day diet log . Patients ask complete Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale ( EBBS ) expect send complete form faculty Springfield College prior arrive College day-long program . Program Day : Patients expect come Springfield College Saturday participate program 8:45 approximately 4 PM depend upon group assignment . Upon arrival College , participant ask medication over-the-counter drug document clinical Pharm D researcher . Any participant previously submit dietary information prior come ask submit logs time member research team take record analyze time undergoing assessment . Assessments During morning period patient assess follow variable : Anthropometrics : Anthropometric measurement include height weight take . Waist girth assess use tension tape measure ( Gulick ) body composition assess use bioelectric impedance analysis ( Tanita , model BC-418 ) . Cardiovascular assessment : Prior perform activity assessment day , patient rest blood pressure determine , dominant arm , use calibrate automated sphygmomanometer ( Tango , Sun Tech Medical , Morrisville , NC ) . They also pulse wave analysis ( PWA ) perform use Sphymocor machine ( EXCEL ) . This give information augmentation index ( measure arterial stiffness ) , along measure central blood pressure pulse pressure . Functional Movement Screen ( FMS ) : Each participant assess ability perform follow movement without restriction : deep squat , active straight leg raise , shoulder mobility , trunk stability push . A score assign base upon well movement perform . Functional test : Following anthropometric assessment , series functional test administer . The six minute walk test perform participant accord American Thoracic Society guideline . A 20-meter , flat hallway use course cone set end marker . Every 3 foot mark along course . Chairs available participant end course , well middle distance mark . Participants instruct complete distance time allot , walk . At minute , participant tell `` You well , 5 ( 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) minute go . '' When 15 second leave , participant tell wait `` Stop '' command instruct stop wherever course . The partial lap distance record added total lap distance . The sit-to-stand-to-sit test also use participant . A sturdy , armless chair height 43.7 cm use . Each participant instruct fold hand chest complete one practice sit-to-stand-to-sit . It make clear hand allow use . Then , participant instruct sit ten time fast time complete record second . A Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) score create summation score test stand balance , gait speed , rise chair 5 time . The SPPB show excellent reliability predictive validity number outcome include mortality , onset disability , institutionalization , use large , multicenter , randomize control trial observational study primary outcome screening purpose . Grip Strength : Grip strength assess use Jamar hand hold dynamometer . Participants ask sit chair flex dominant arm 90° angle . The dynamometer fit individual 's hand participant ask exert maximal effort three time . The high record score ( kg ) use statistical analysis . Strength/Power Assessments : Baseline strength power also assess dominant leg ( quadriceps hamstring ) use isokinetic dynamometry ( Biodex ) . The purpose test explain participant . Each participant strap seat securely use chest strap , lap strap leg strap . The straps ensure accessory muscle use test . The participant adjust machine fulcrum lateral aspect dominant knee exactly align axis rotation machine . All baseline adjustment record participant point . Once participant ready engage , information regard ROM weight limb adjust accord computer program procedure . Each participant give trial round 4 repetition instruct push pull leg hard could . Then , 3 round test complete 5 repetition speed 90/120/150 degree per second . Each participant remind breathe , hold breath time assess . Strength power measurement record participant . After test session complete , individual assign usual care group receive dietary advice allow go home individual randomize intervention group give instruction prepare plant-based meal professional chef College 's dining service . Following lunch , participant rotate follow station receive one-on-one counseling expert specific area base upon specific score earlier assessment . The following section contain information regard specific information cover area : Behavioral Methods Instruments : Kidney Disease Quality Life ( KDQOL ) - Short Form ( 12 ) . The KDQOL-36™ short form include SF-12 generic core supplement multi-item scale target particular concern individual kidney disease ( i.e . burden kidney disease , symptoms/problems kidney disease , effect kidney disease scale daily life ) . The KDQOL-SF derive KDQOL ( 13 ) , long-form questionnaire , whose use limited length ( 134 item ) . The questionnaire one complete instrument currently available ass health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) patient include general specific aspects health , allow complete evaluation HRQOL dimension relevant patient . The author KDQOL develop standalone Excel score tool use score instrument . The Self-Efficacy Regulate Exercise Habits Questionnaire . Self-efficacy regulate exercise habit relate belief one perform exercise activity face impediment ( e.g.. , fatigue , time constraint , unfavorable environmental condition , compete demand ) . Subjects rate scale range 0 ( `` '' ) ; intermediate degree assurance , 50 ( `` moderately certain '' ) ; complete assurance , 100 ( `` highly certain '' ) . The Self-Efficacy Regulate Eating Habits Questionnaire ( Cronbach alpha = 0.93 ) Subjects ask rate confidence able `` stick healthy eat habit '' face different tempt situation ( e.g . hungry , eat others , holiday time , feel upset ) . Subjects rate scale range 0 ( `` '' ) ; intermediate degree assurance , 50 ( `` moderately certain '' ) ; complete assurance , 100 ( `` highly certain '' ) . Participants intervention condition give brief individualized counselling achieve lifestyle goal . Participants meet one-on-one behavioral health counselor develop personalized self-management program . A program formulate patient manageable goal lifestyle change negotiate , specific individually tailor intervention strategy increase self-efficacy decrease barrier change develop . The key feature intervention ) assessment current physical activity dietary habit , b ) investigate perceive benefit , barrier cost behavior change , c ) patient participation goal set select personalized strategy overcome barrier prevent relapse , ) establish follow-up contact . Regular self-assessment use empower participant take responsibility decision make informed choice . Follow-up contact make via email counselor meet patient assessment visit , one week post-assessment monthly thereafter . These emails focus extent patient achieve goal since last contact , patient reinforce assisted problem-solving additional strategy appropriate . Patients also receive additional write material tailor current concern ( e.g . focus lapse relapse , discussion time management strategy , cue get back activity plan holiday ) . Pharmacy Methods : A clinical PharmD researcher conduct patient interview . Preparation interview include contact participant request bring prescription over-the-counter medication `` Move Health Study . '' Patients specifically inform bring prescription ( include take need ) , counter medication ( medicine sleep , allergy , etc . ) , vitamin , herbal , cream inhaler use within past month . At begin Move Health Study , participant provide bag medication pharmacist . While patient complete initial phase study , pharmacist document medication include dosage , sig , day 's supply last refill date , evaluate medication nephrotoxic effect , interaction , contraindication medication appropriateness CKD . This do patient without pharmacist 's knowledge patient randomization group . Any medication identify potentially harmful nephrotoxic patient address lead physician study group discussion . Once patient randomize , assign intervention group meet individually pharmacist . Patients usual care group excuse without pharmacy associate change long medication identify potentially harmful nephrotoxic . A detailed patient medication history obtain , include current dose ; schedule patient report side effect . Adherence associate barrier assess use Morisky 8-point adherence tool ( MMSA-8 ) . Patients also ask specifically , `` Within past week , many dos medication miss ? '' Based upon information gather , pharmacist make evidence-based intervention . Interventions include provide patient recommend dosing schedule , appropriate timing relation food medication , tool improve adherence . These tool include recommend pill organizer , timer decrease medication dose frequency . Medication schedule base pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics consideration well therapeutic guideline recommendation . The administration drug comply standard operating procedure follow RTANE ( see attach SOP ) . The medication store RTANE research refrigerator maintain 2-8 °C temperature dispense subject tell . This research refrigerator monitor make sure keep stored medication correct temperature . Patients educated medication indication , OTC herbal medication eliminate avoid ( e.g. , NSAIDs ) . Patients provide opportunity ask medication relate question address individually pharmacist . In intervention group , pharmacist follow follow algorithm base recent KDIGO guideline : 1 . If subject RAS blocker , pharmacist titrate dose maximal dose order achieve BP &lt; 130/80 . 2 . If patient elevate urinary albumin excretion , RAS inhibitor dose also titrate maximal dose . 3 . If potassium &gt; 5.2 , Veltassa provide dosed accord PI Nutrition Methods Participants require keep 3-day food log prior day-long program . The information food log analyze Food Processor Diet Analysis Software program ( ESHA , Salem , OR ) nutritional content . The ESHA Food Processor Nutrition Analysis software widely use assess nutrient content food research clinical practice . The software provide analyse 55,000 food food item , provide analysis 163 nutritional component . During dietary consultation , diet analysis review participant , regard individual dietary macronutrient micronutrient content . Specific attention pay amount quality protein , well amount sodium , phosphorous , potassium contain diet . Recommendations dietary modification base vegan approach . Participants intervention group encourage decrease amount animal protein diet choose plant-based meal . The quality animal protein address ; red meat dairy product highly discourage , follow poultry , fish . Education provide significance reduce sodium , phosphorous , potassium kidney health . Strategies reduce intake micronutrient present , specifically type food avoid type include diet . Individual barrier success achieve suggest dietary modification address , strategy implement change discuss base participant 's individual circumstance . Participants also attend lunch cook education session , professional chef demonstrate prepare vegan meal . During session , strategy enhance flavor appeal plant-based meal present aid participant able practically include plant-based meal daily diet . The treatment group unrestricted potassium diet . Individuals randomize control group counsel standard 1 gram/kg protein diet 2 gram potassium sodium restriction . Dietary adherence assess control intervention group use food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) . A standard portion size six possible frequency consumption response , range `` never '' `` two time per day '' give food group base food nutrient emphasize minimize prescribe diet ( i.e. , animal protein , sodium , potassium ) . Physical fitness method : Based upon performance FMS , individual counsel regard type exercise perform . The prescribed exercise demonstrate taught subject leave go home know perform exercise correct form . Examples exercise could demonstrate follow : - Wall hip hinge - Chair squat - Dumbbell bent row - Seated horizontal band row - Seated vertical band row - elevate push wall push - Seated one arm dumbbell press , - Band curl , - Band triceps push Each participant also give set stretch perform taught perform stretch research staff member responsible fitness . Examples stretch could use follow : - Wall calf stretch - Seated stand hamstring stretch - Chair quadriceps stretch - Wall chest stretch - Wall latissimus dorsi stretch . Subjects also instruct aim walk least 30 minute , 5 time per week moderate intensity comply standard physical activity recommendation accumulate least 150 minute per week moderate intensity physical activity . They instruct avoid prolong period time engage sedentary behavior aim reduce sit time . Examples way reduce sedentary behavior discuss participant encourage implement strategy could work . Some could use include stand commercial break watch television consciously take movement break hour set timer 15-20 interval . As previously state , participant intervention group issue packet exercise home . This packet contain simple step step instruction illustration perform movement correct form . Prior leave College day , exercise demonstrate participant taught perform exercise correct form . A member research group contact ( either phone email ) begin week intervention period review exercise program week come discus challenge might encounter previous week . The mean communication use decide upon depend upon preference participant . During weekly communication , member research team review strategy participant use reduce sedentary behavior provide encouragement endeavor . Participants also require keep log activity return log research team return retest date . The activity log serve motivational tool aid research team supervise ( adapt necessary ) exercise program . Participants encourage contact research coordinator time question need clarification perform home-based exercise program . Physical Activity Monitoring : By end test day , participant give GT3XPB Actigraph monitor ( Actigraph , Pensacola , FL ) instruction wear monitor follow 7 day . They ask return monitor research coordinator download data storage later analysis . This process repeat time participant come College test . Objective data capture ActiGraph system ( i.e. , mean time spend sedentary behavior , light , moderate vigorous physical activity ) use compare physical activity sedentary behavior intervention control group measure exercise adherence . Planned Follow All participant Move Health Study expect return College approximately one , three 6 month reassess identical procedure perform initial visit . Standard CKD lab ( CBC , electrolytes , BUN , creatinine , PTH . magnesium , uric acid urinary albumin excretion ) measure assessment .
