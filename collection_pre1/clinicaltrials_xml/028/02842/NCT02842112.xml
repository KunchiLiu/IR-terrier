	<brief_summary>Over recent decade , improvement make treatment adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . This mainly attributed improvement supportive therapy intensification treatment strategy . The introduction post-induction myeloablative regimen follow allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) reduce relapse rate young adult . However , procedure limited availability human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -identical donor conventional SCT preparative regimen accord patient age . In absence compatible donor , myeloablative chemotherapy follow autologous peripheral blood ( PB ) SCT remain one treatment strategy adult patient AML , allow 35 - 50 % long-term survivor . Despite several advantage CD34+ cell mobilization procedure , recent data show relapse high leukemia-free survival ( LFS ) shorter compare bone marrow ( BM ) autograft . Higher dos CD34+ peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) collect ensure engraftment possibly reduce incidence treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) . Although threshold CD34+ cell dose engraftment delay AML , positive linear correlation number CD34+ cell kinetics engraftment reach limit increase number progenitor cell provide additional benefit . Relapse show high survival shorter receive high CD34+ PB dose . Although highly active leukemia bulk , intensive chemotherapy often spar hardy leukemia stem cell ( LSCs ) responsible relapse . Detection minimal residual disease ( MRD ) autologous PBSC product may reflect inadequate vivo purging , least part responsible relapse . Although represent heterogeneous cell population include normal leukemia cell , despite recent data challenge CD34+ CD38- phenotype LSCs AML , CD34+ CD38- cell population generally remain consider enriched LSCs . In set , MRD remain morphological complete remission ( CR ) relatively enriched CD34+ CD38- leukemia cell , persistence CR achievement correlate disease recurrence . This investigated cohort 123 patient AML follow apheresis procedure CR achievement . The investigator also study impact infuse dose subpopulation CD34+ PB cell outcome subset 71 patient underwent autologous PBSCT .</brief_summary>
