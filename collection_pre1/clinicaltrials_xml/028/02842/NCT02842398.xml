	<brief_title>Independent Walking Speed Crossing City Street</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability adequately perform functional task level allow independent community live key measure success physical therapy program . The essential task need allow independent community live well document elderly population . However , task delineate pediatric population . The investigator aim determine select sequence train use Balance Master , add establish physical therapy treatment program , increase gait velocity ambulatory child receive in-or outpatient rehabilitation relation ability cross intersection within confines community traffic signal ( &gt; 120 cm/sec ) . One essential task necessary urban environment ability cross street within time constraint traffic signal . Walking speed become increasingly important living urban setting , ability cross street safely fundamental achieve independence . One major criticism clinic/lab-based measure gait speed relative performance may representative independence within community . Participants age 5 21 year , recruit patient population Blythedale Children 's Hospital six week trial . Children assign one two random group : one weekly Balance Master sequence training group ( addition regularly schedule therapy session ) group continue regularly schedule therapy session alone . Gait velocity measure `` Walk Across '' Functional Assessment use Balance Master long force plate .</detailed_description>
