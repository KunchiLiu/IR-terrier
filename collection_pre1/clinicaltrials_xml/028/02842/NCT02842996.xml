	<brief_title>Patient Reported Experience Measures Following Hip Fracture Surgery Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale research : Recovery follow hip fracture surgery associate poor functional outcome ; ( Marcantonio et al . 2001 ; Luger et al . 2010 ) patient may require long hospital stay , often discharge long-term care , generally poor prognosis return home regain function activity daily live ( ADL ) . ( Dolan et al . 2000 ) Loss live independently community significant detrimental effect quality life patient report would rather dead experience loss independence result hip fracture . ( Salkeld et al . 2000 ) Patients report go home follow hip fracture surgery would main priority . ( Robinson et al . 2015 ) Recovery patient multi-faceted include physical , social emotional domain . ( Miller &amp; Mythen 2014 ) Increasingly focus modified include patient related experience healthcare pathway inform policymakers , health regulation service improvement . ( Gibbons &amp; Fitzpatrick 2012 ) Patient public involvement ( PPI ) via Clinical Research Ambassador Group ( CRAG ) Heart England NHS Foundation Trust help identify research question particular focus improve perioperative care pathway . Members CRAG group report impact hip fracture include loss functional ability lead additional stress family member . They advocate qualitative study assess impact patient carers base personal experience . We aim conduct interview ascertain important relevant patient report experience measure elderly patient undergo hip fracture surgery . Aims : To review evaluate literature ascertain theme related patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery improve quality care . To conduct interview ascertain patient carer experience surround discharge hospital follow hip fracture surgery ? To identify important theme guide u improve care-pathway surround patient discharge follow fracture neck femur surgery elderly . To pilot resource/information pack design specifically improve patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery ? Research question : In publish literature theme related patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery improve quality care ? What patient carer experience surround discharge hospital follow hip fracture surgery ? From patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery important theme improve discharge pathway patient carers . What information include resource pack design help patient carer follow hip fracture surgery ? Will resource/information pack design specifically help improve patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery ? Qualitative Interviews : To explore physical , mental emotional impact patient care-givers follow hip fracture surgery conduct semi-structured interview patient care-givers . Participants include patient undergone hip fracture surgery name care-giver . Participants screen single study site use clinical database well review new patient admit orthopaedic ward . Patients exclude unable consent unable partake interview due speech language impairment . Conduct Interviews : Semi-structured interview conduct patient carers location choice . This residence study site ; choose travel study site travel expense re-imbursed . If patient carers interview time , aim interview separately , unless request interview together . The interview carry one member research team aim ensure consistency interview question technique throughout study . Prior start interview participant reconfirm consent . The interviews audio-recorded write note also take . Ethical consideration consent : Written consent obtain participant in-patient hospital stay . An informal capacity/consent process use trained member research team . Written verbal information provide study , use suitable style format participant . The researcher ask participant recall study information check understanding ; together clinical team view use ass capacity consent . Consent sought : - Accessing medical record purpose collect relevant patient outcomes patient health service use . - Participating face face interview follow hospital discharge . If patient deem capacity include study . Risks , burden benefit : There small risk distress patient and/or carer interview describe memory experience . There may also time-burden patient carers take part interview . To minimise factor ensure interview conduct day time convenient patient carer . They able stop interview time take break require . If patient/carer request identify require support offer contact general practitioner ( GP ) behalf . The patient carer interview separately either require support feel vulnerable leave alone interview together . If patient require interview conduct community patient 's home risk researcher , conduct interview , put potential vulnerable situation . This minimise ensure researcher follow Birmingham Heartlands Hospital lone worker policy . Data analysis : Interviews record analyse anonymously author know participant detail . Data transcribe verbatim ; transcript thereafter review check accuracy . Coding transcript occur , second reviewer check . Results data analysis guide development resource/information pack design specifically help improve patient carer experience follow hip fracture surgery . Dissemination result : This study directly benefit participant improve service patient future undergoing hip fracture surgery . It identify area need/support guide National Health Service ( NHS ) policymakers healthcare provision development service facilitate discharge community . By understand important patient report experience measure go use compare quality healthcare group patient improve care pathway .</detailed_description>
