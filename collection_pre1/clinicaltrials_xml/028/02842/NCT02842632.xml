	<detailed_description>The clinical utility transesophageal echocardiography increasingly recognize perioperative medicine . However , train TEE base hands-on training operation room time consume therefore use experience limit among anesthesiologist . Recent study demonstrate simulation-based education also superior conventional didactic system superior hands-on teaching OR term theoretical knowledge echocardiography . So far study evaluate study effect obtain 11 basic TEE view recommend American Society Echocardiography ( ASE ) Society Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists ( SCA ) simulator train training operation room resident prior knowledge echocardiography . According tot ASE SCA principal goal basic TEE examination intraoperative monitoring . The basic TEE examination focus 11 relevant view , enable anesthesiologist diagnose general hemodynamic instability etiology surgical patient consequence influence surgical outcome . The 11 basic TEE view easier remember faster obtain detailed 20 view standard examination . Therefore investigator want assess difference study effect obtain 11 basic TEE view also theoretical knowledge 3 group resident prior knowledge echocardiography : simulation group ( CAE Vimedix Simulator ) , hands-on OR group online group ( http : //pie.med.utoronto.ca/TEE/ ) . prospective randomize single-center study . The investigator want include 51 anaesthesia resident ( 17 per group ) first second year training prior knowledge echocardiography randomize , Controlled single-centre study . Residents recruit invitation TEE training first second year residency large teach hospital ( AKH Wien ) . The study conduct 3 consecutive study day final exam ( theoretical practical third day ) . The first study day start lecture test subject , especially physical principle heart anatomy . Then student complete theoretical test ( TT1 ) basic knowledge TEE , principles ultrasonography , heart anatomy , indication well contraindication , patient safety complication , probe manipulation knowledge basic pathology ( Severe hypovolemia , LV failure , RV failure , Tamponade , acute massive left-sided valvular regurgitation , circulatory arrest resuscitation successful resuscitation . Afterwards participant randomise . After , student get introduce protocol , explain examination process . Group A introduce virtual TEE online ( http : //pie.med.utoronto.ca/TEE/ ) , group B simulator ( CAE Vimedix Simulator ) group C TEE training operation room . From student group B C receive 2 practical session รก 40 minute within next 2 week . Group A study two time virtual TEE . The first practical session do first study day , follow one within 2 week final study day theoretical practical test ( TT2 PT3 ) within 1 week second training session . All teaching session start practical test ( PT1 PT2 ) . This test contain 11 basic TEE view . After 2 teaching session student attend second theoretical test ( TT2 ) final practical test ( PT3 ) . For practical test student adjust name 11 basic TEE view within 10 minute . There ba follow 3 month theoretical practical test ( TT3 PT4 ) . The investigator want assess pre- post training score theoretical multiple choice test practical test 3 group . The multiple choice test consist 50 question 1 point per question ( max . 50 point ) practical test evaluation 11 basic perioperative TEE examination simulator ( CAE Vimedix Simulator ) . Each view evaluate scale 0 10 accord predetermine criterion include image angle , overall clarity visualization 3 major anatomic structure pertinent view . Each view receive maximum score 10 study maximum 109 ( ME asc . aortic LAX 2 main structure ) . Further time adjust view time complete basic TEE Examination assess .</detailed_description>
