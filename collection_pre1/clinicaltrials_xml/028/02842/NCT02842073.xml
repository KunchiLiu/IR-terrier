	<detailed_description>This open-label Phase IIa pilot study tolerability effect binge drink bupropion naltrexone binge drinker assess cortical adaptation tactile stimuli subject binge drink . Participants : Investigators recruit 12 men woman age 21-34 year exhibit minimum 5/3 ( men/women ) binge drink episode per month past three month . A binge drinking episode define consumption 5/4 ( men/women ) standard drink ( ~12 gm ethanol ) two hour period . Subjects may meet DSM-V criterion mild moderate alcohol use disorder . Subjects overt physical dependence alcohol , significant medical problem include seizure bulimia , substance use disorder except occasional marijuana ( base toxicology screen ) significant psychiatric illness exclude . Procedures ( method ) : As first step human trial investigator give open label bupropion + naltrexone active binge drinking subject . The primary goal ass tolerability acceptability though change binge drink subjective sense `` effect '' gather well . Investigators also test cortical adaptation binge drink complete tactile sensory test compare result controls individual overt physical dependence alcohol . Investigators recruit subject use e-mail listserve UNC student , faculty staff . Investigators use standard clinical dos bupropion-XL 300 mg/d ( low seizure risk ) naltrexone 50 mg/d dispense UNC Investigational Drug Services . Bupropion XL initiate 150 mg/d Days 1-4 increase 300 mg/d Days 5-84 . Naltrexone initiate 25 mg/d Days 7-9 go 50 mg/d Days 10-84 . Subjects see screen Weeks 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 12 . Subjects breathalyze receive Medical Management counseling encourage compliance progress towards drinking goal . Investigators use Time Line Follow-Back approach ass alcohol consumption history modify include time take consume alcohol define binge . They also measure crave alcohol ass tolerability probe adverse effect . Key outcomes interest include tolerability acceptability , drink behavior include frequency intensity binge drinking , crave alcohol . Because open-label trial without placebo comparison group formal statistic complete efficacy assess . Instead , pilot study inform investigator recruitment binge drinker , tolerability acceptability bupropion/naltrexone population potential efficacy signal .</detailed_description>
