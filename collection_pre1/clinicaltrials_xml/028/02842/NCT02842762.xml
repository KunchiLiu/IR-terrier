	<brief_title>3D Echocardiographic Assessment Epicardial Pacing After Cardiopulmonary Bypass .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgical patient sometimes require temporary pacing wire optimize cardiac function wean cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , and/or treat hemodynamically significant brady-arrhythmias . The available patient series report 8.6 % 23.9 % patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) valve surgery require temporary pacing time CPB . The site pacemaker wire placement seem crucial determinant cardiac output . In non-surgical patient isolate right ventricular ( RV ) pace seem induce electromechanical dyssynchrony RV leave ventricle ( LV ) . A normal ventricle sinus rhythm display simultaneous contraction segment heart , regional minimal volume ( i.e . maximal contraction ) occur time . Isolated RV pace seem result leave bundle branch type electrical activation sequence , delay contraction segment . The LV , RV , seem negatively affected state dyssynchrony , result decreased cardiac output . In surgical patient however , data available yet . Since isolated RV epicardial wire placement still widely practice cardiac surgery , institution , would like study effect RV pace LV synchrony LV output . Again study non-surgical patient receive resynchronization therapy , know real-time three-dimensional ( 3D ) echocardiography useful pick subtle change LV synchrony thereby guide synchronization ventricular contraction . However , date usefulness real-time 3D echocardiography guide pacemaker therapy cardiac surgery unknown . In present feasibility study cardiac surgical patient , want investigate acute effect isolate RV pace LV synchrony , LV output .</detailed_description>
