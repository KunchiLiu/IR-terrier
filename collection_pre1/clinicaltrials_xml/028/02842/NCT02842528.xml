	<brief_title>Cognitive Vulnerability Factors Alcohol-dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol dependence involve environmental genetic vulnerability factor . Although rather high degree heritability ( estimate range 40 % 60 % ) , vulnerability alcohol dependence broadly recognise complex polygenic phenotype . To clarify risk factor involve alcohol dependence , attempt make identify endophenotypes alcohol dependent patient relative . Endophenotypes define heritable trait associate increase risk develop disorder ; must find probands unaffected relative higher rate general population must associate specific genetic pattern . In present study investigator investigate cognitive performance alcohol dependent patient comparison group adult non-alcoholic offspring alcohol-dependent patient group participant without family history alcohol dependence . The investigator also explore relation familial density alcoholism cognitive performance , particularly mental flexibility inhibition . Genetic analysis also conduct investigate relationship cognitive performance genetic pattern ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) .</detailed_description>
