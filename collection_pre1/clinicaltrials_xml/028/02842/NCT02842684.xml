	<brief_summary>Preoperative planning carry allow response preparedness . A layer technique usually use standard radiography .The investigator record routine preoperative radiograph standard recognize advantage reproducibility measurement compare plain radiography . The Toulouse Hospitals develop technology part routine assessment hip prothesis pre postoperatively . The TraumaCad software superimpose implant Picture Archiving Communication System evaluate digital reproducible size implant correct position . This demonstrate superiority modern digital tool preoperative preparation Orthopaedics set .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Modern joint replacement orthopedic surgery allow restore locomotion . More 150,000 hip replacement perform year France . The optimization result go restoration lengths member anatomy . Preoperative plan hip replacement optimize return hip rotation center . Preoperative plan hip prothesis practice layer radiograph whose scaling imprecise . The recent TraumaCad system ( BrainlabÂ® ) allow adjustment scale patient virtual positioning implant simulate response return geometric parameter hip . Preoperative planning TraumaCad hip arthroplasty provide good restitution limb length conventional planning method . The standardized radiograph investigator want compare group control group operate without TraumaCad plan evaluate accuracy software predict implant size also . There risk patient procedure . The direct benefit increase accuracy surgical gesture patient reduction mechanical problem relate leg length . Earnings orthopedic community postoperative evaluation . In long term , prosthetic technical improvement must increase life prosthesis therefore low revision less expenditure term public health . The widespread use automate plan objective assessment postoperative radiograph .</detailed_description>
