	<brief_title>A Study Determine Final Geriatric Assessment Haematology ( GAH ) Score Tool Predicting Tolerance Treatment Elderly Patients ( ≥ 65 Years ) With Haematologic Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients 65 prevalent population oncological clinical practice . It also expect group patient increase significantly come decade result increase life expectancy age population . Overall , population age age accompanied increase prevalence incidence age-related disease , cancer . So much approximately 60 % new cancer case 70 % overall cancer mortality occur patient age 65 . Despite high incidence cancer elderly peculiarity oppose young patient , point view health , management elderly patient especially complex data evaluation treatment thereof . Often , old patient underrepresented clinical trial treatment guideline , result population undertreated great risk suffer treatment-related toxicity . In respect , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) International Society Geriatric Oncology ( SIOG , acronym Spanish ) agree age impediment treat disease . Optimal management require strategy specifically direct clinical biological characteristic type patient recommend appropriate assessment patient part safe effective approach haematological malignancy elderly . There scientific basis support need elderly patient cancer receive particular treatment specifically assess mean comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) . Geriatric assessment essential since tool integrates aspects patient 's life could affect course disease response treatment , functional status , comorbidities , cognitive , emotional nutritional status social environment . In addition , CGA tool identify possible presence fragility , characterize decrease physiological reserve condition low response stress associate low risk disability increase morbidity mortality . Although currently assume chronological age synonymous biological age , decision cancer treatment often fall subjective assessment physician , healthcare centre perform comprehensive geriatric assessment oncology set . Although various tool develop purpose , incorporated routine clinical practice due time require , length resource need gather information . Therefore , remain need find scale comprehensive assessment health status elderly patient ( ≥ 65 year ) haematologic malignancy incorporate essential dimension geriatric assessment , precision valid tool currently available , simple , straightforward easy apply , use daily practice assist make clinical decision objectively . It hypothesize simplify geriatric assessment could better tool assess elderly patient , instead consider age subjective clinical impression , decide whether prescribe active treatment . Such tool would represent real multidimensional nature age , associate increase incidence chronic disease geriatric syndrome consequence vulnerability patient survival . As described , Bonanad et al . design develop new comprehensive assessment scale aim elderly patient ( ≥ 65 year ) diagnose haematological disease [ myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( LLC ) ] , Geriatric Assessment Haematology ( GAH ) . The purpose scale help doctor identify objectively reliably elderly patient haematological disease eligible intensive treatment versus vulnerable . The GAH scale tool 30 item group eight relevant dimension geriatric assessment , include : 1 . Number drug : Polypharmacy associate adverse effect relate frailty , disability , mortality fall elderly , may frequent elderly patient cancer . 2 . Gait velocity : Determining time take walk four meter normal pace method assess gait velocity widely use literature due simplicity , speed reliability . There sufficient evidence consider walk speed strong consistent predictor adverse outcome old patient , use single item prove least sensitive compound instrument predict result long-term . 3 . Mood : We propose screen test depression single item extract Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) , widely use validity reliability . This unique simple measure depression show strongly correlate clinical diagnosis depression ; detect patient rarely sometimes depressed patient depress occasionally much time . 4 . Activities daily living : The assessment functional status old people include assessment so-called basic activity daily live ( ADLs ) , include skill necessary life dressing , grooming , bath feeding . ADL tool use predictor hospitalization mortality elderly patient . To develop activity daily live ( ADL ) GAH scale , item select Vulnerable Elders Survey ( VES-13 ) two additional question . 5 . Subjective health status : The patient rating health another worthwhile parameter . This self-rated health item also select , also include Vulnerable Elders Survey ( VES-13 ) . Recently determine predictive parameter functional impairment death . 6 . Nutrition : Nutritional deficit common serious problem elderly patient , contribute significantly morbidity mortality associate group people . To determine dimension , item select short version full questionnaire , Mini-Nutritional Assessment . This tool develop validated representative sample old patient worldwide identifies subject nutritional risk . 7 . Mental State : To evaluate mental state , item select make Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) . It design validated assess four aspect intellectual functioning : short long-term memory , orientation , information daily event compute ability . It observe cognitive impairment also independent predictor mortality end chemotherapy . 8 . Comorbidity : Six variables comorbidity habit consider ( diabetes mellitus , cancer , lung disease , heart failure , smoking ) , draw Prognostic Index 4-year Mortality Older Adults . The final score GAH scale yet define . At present , purely exploratory purpose , dimension assign dichotomous score ( 0 1 ) , generate provisional score range 0 ( best possible health status ) 8 ( bad health status ) . The recently publish study show GAH scale measure instrument meet expect psychometric property ( feasibility , ceiling-floor effect , reliability validity ) tool determine health status elderly patient haematological disease . Also , determine scale sensitive change &lt; pending ( reference short report ) &gt; , since able detect change health status patient certain time able predict survival patient group . This study aim determine weight dimension GAH scale , well cut-off point final score scale use predict treatment tolerability elderly patient diagnose MDS/ AML , MM CLL ( chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) .</detailed_description>
