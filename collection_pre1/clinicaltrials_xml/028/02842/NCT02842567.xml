	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) reach epidemic proportion rapidly become one common cause chronic liver disease child . The pathogenesis NAFLD generally consider result series liver injury , commonly refer `` multi-hit '' hypothesis . Several study suggest inflammatory pathway oxidative stress could responsible disease progression non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Hydroxytyrosol simple phenolic compound naturally occur olive olive oil antioxidant property . Some study demonstrate hydroxytyrosol show several anti-inflammatory anti-atherogenic activity , inhibition LDL oxidation platelet aggregation . Alpha tocopherol ( Vitamin E ) study anti-oxydant pediatric NAFLD conflicting result . It inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production attenuate release profibrogenic agent liver collagen . The purpose interventional study evaluate efficacy tolerability Hydroxytyrosol Vitamin E treatment child biopsy-proven NASH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxytyrosol Vitamin E Pediatric NASH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 child adolescent ( 4-16 year ) biopsy-proven NASH enrol . They randomize treatment hydroxytyrosol vitamin E ( n : 40 pt ) identical placebo ( n : 40 pt ) give orally period 16 week . Patients undergo medical evaluation baseline ( enrollment ) 4 month ( end treatment ) . Anthropometric measure laboratory assay , includin liver enzyme , gluco-insulinemic lipid profile perform baseline end study . Hepatic ultrasound examination perform enrollment end study . Serum sample determination marker inflammation oxidative stress collect enrollment end study . A stool sample analysis gut microbioma collect enrollment end study .</detailed_description>
