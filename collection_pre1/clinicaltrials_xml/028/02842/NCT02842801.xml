	<brief_title>Hip Manipulation Young Adults With Groin , Lateral Hip Buttock Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike old adult hip osteoarthritis , young adult pain groin , lateral hip buttock general loss ROM , specific directional motion loss , hip flexion internal rotation . Therefore , common manual therapy design gradually improve hip range motion ( ROM ) osteoarthritis , long axis distraction , may appropriate treat young adult hip pain . A manipulation technique , unrestrained femoral internal rotation ( UFIR ) , design specifically treat young adult ' hip pain . Manipulation procedure involve use high- amplitude low-velocity thrust mid end range restrict joint purpose improve range motion ( ROM ) within joint ability joint tolerate load . Although clinician routinely use hip manipulation technique treat young adult ' hip pain satisfy success , study yet conduct examine effectiveness hip manipulation technique . The investigator interest identify young adult pain groin , lateral hip buttock would benefit hip manipulation . Adverse effect manipulation report none mild . Mild soreness muscle tenderness posterior great trochanter region report . In preliminary study UFIR manipulation 35 participant , 5 report mild discomfort immediately manipulation , participant report adverse effect UFIR manipulation . Purpose Study : The purpose propose study identify characteristic young adult pain groin , lateral hip buttock benefit manipulation hip . Research question : What predictor positive outcome hip manipulation young adult groin , lateral hip buttock pain ? Procedures : At begin study , participant groin/lateral hip/buttock pain informed risk , benefit procedure study . Once participant agree participate , ask sign write consent form approve TWU Institutional Review Board - Dallas . Once participant sign consent form , number assign participant form use marked number . All data collection include test treatment perform Texas Woman 's University ( TWU ) - Dallas , Lab # 8113 , private treatment room Physical Therapy &amp; Injury Specialist clinic , Englewood , CO. Each participant come twice 24-48 hour visit . 1st Visit : On first visit , participant ask fill intake form medical questionnaire determine eligibility participant . Next , one investigator perform neurological exam , include dural test , femoral nerve test , deep tendon reflex , key muscle test Babinski/Hoffman rule lumbar neurologic involvement . If participant find positive neurological test , participant exclude study . Outcome Measures Special Questions : Once participant determine eligible study , participant ask complete follow 4 questionnaire : 1 . Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) body chart 2 . Lower Extremity Functional Scale 3 . The Copenhagen Hip Groin Outcome Score ( HAGOS ) 4 . Special question functional activity . The reliability validity NPRS , LEFS HAGOs show reliable valid . The special question use describe characteristic participant young adult groin , lateral hip buttock pain . Physical Examination A standard physical therapy examination specific hip perform investigator perform hip manipulation : 1 . Functional test : 3 functional test assess : deep squat , hurdle inline lunge . 2 . Palpation test : 11 palpation test examine . The surround bony landmark soft tissue also palpate tenderness abnormality . To improve test accuracy , investigator video tape 2 palpation test : single leg stand single leg stance . 3 . Range motion ( ROM ) measurement : 8 hip ROMs measure supine prone . A universal goniometer use take hip ROMs . Two measurement take motion , average two use data analysis . 4 . Manual muscle strength test : 8 hip manual muscle test perform sit , supine , sidelying prone position : - Sitting : flexion - Supine : flexion , internal rotation external rotation - Sidelying : abduction - Prone : extension , internal rotation internal rotation 5 . Provocation test lumbar , sacroiliac hip joint . Intervention : The investigator , license physical therapist different one perform physical examination describe , perform intervention technique , hip manipulation UFIR . During manipulation , participant ask lie unaffected side affect side , hip ( ) flex approximately 30 degree , knee flex approximately 50-70 degree . Pillows place participant 's knee need comfort . The investigator stabilize anterior inferior iliac spine ( ASIS ) ilium finger one hand place thumb posterior aspect great trochanter involve hip . The participant ask verbal approval prior receive manipulation . The manipulation perform investigator 's non-stabilizing hand , thrust great trochanter anteriorly internal rotation moment . The manipulation perform involved side . If participant investigator feel cavitation shift hip joint first manipulation , intervention consider complete . If cavitation/shift heard felt participant investigator first manipulation , investigator repeat manipulation maximum three time . The manipulation perform either two physical therapist specialize manual therapy , certify participate extensive clinical education examination process . Post Intervention After hip manipulation intervention , investigator advise participant continue regular activity perform new activity . In addition , participant ask fill NPRS body chart ( Appendix E ) Global Rating Change ( GROC ) Scale ( Appendix M ) .16 The participant remind second visit day appointment time within 24-48 hour . 2nd Visit During 2nd visit , investigator evaluate participant his/her 1st visit perform physical exam describe first visit , measurement reporting detail . Following physical exam , participant ask fill NPRS body chart , LEFS , HAGOS GROC form . There treatment purpose study . Data Analysis The participant dichotomize two group base response hip manipulation : successful non-successful . Success define 2 point great change NPRS 4 point great change GROC . These criterion use reference standard dichotomize participant variable collect patient 's history , self-reported questionnaire physical exam . Regression analysis use examine significant predictors/characteristics successful outcome hip manipulation young adult groin , lateral hip buttock pain .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The eligible participant young adult gender age 1840 complaint groin , lateral hip and/or buttock pain . Participants exclude participate study follow medical surgical history . These factor may affect result study : 1 . Impaired general health , e.g . fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome , cancer etc . 2 . Neurologic neurovascular dysfunction 3 . History peripheral vascular disease , diabetes abdominal aneurysm 4 . History hip joint pathology , slip epiphysis , Legg Calve Perthes , significant congenital hip dysplasia , hip dislocation , 5 . History systemic disease affect musculoskeletal neuromuscular system , include inflammatory arthritides , connective tissue disease , multiple sclerosis , muscular dystrophy , cerebral vascular diseases 6 . Known instability hip sacroiliac joint 7 . History low back low extremity surgery , e.g . total hip replacement , total knee replacement , lumbar laminectomy . 8 .
