	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate immune lot consistency antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine demonstrate immune non-inferiority antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine v license MCV4 vaccine . Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate immune lot consistency antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine respect serum bactericidal assay use human complement ( hSBA ) geometric mean titer . - To demonstrate non-inferiority antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine ( pooled Lots 1 3 ) compare observe follow administration single dose license MCV4 vaccine . Secondary Objective : - To demonstrate non-inferiority antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine ( pooled Lots 1 3 ) compare observe follow administration single dose license MCV4 vaccine adult population ( 18 55 year old ) - To demonstrate non-inferiority antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration single dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine ( pooled Lots 1 3 ) compare observe follow administration single dose license MCV4 vaccine adolescent population ( 10 17 year old ) Observational Objectives : - To describe safety profile MenACYW conjugate vaccine license MCV4 vaccine .</brief_summary>
