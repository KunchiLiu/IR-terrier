	<brief_title>Examining Impact Physician Influence Hearing Aid User Satisfaction Retention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Description study design This study seek determine additional patient benefit derive involve refer physician hearing aid fitting process use Client Oriented Scale Improvement ( COSI ) process . The COSI process well-known methodology consist two consecutive phase : Phase I complete client Audiologist either time initial hearing aid fitting within 21 day thereafter . The patient ask list specific listen environment/situations he/she would like improve his/her hear assistance wear hearing aid ; Phase II occur within day 22 76 day hearing aid device fit also normally complete patient Audiologist . In phase , patient indicates degree change specific listen environment/situations he/she previously list ( wear hearing aid ) . Two method use study purpose assess patient satisfaction hearing aid use 77 90 day post fitting : ( 1 ) validate SADL questionnaire describe previously complete patient ( 2 ) number hear aid return 90 day post initial fitting record . The study consist two group : control group test group . Both group undergo Phase I COSI process fit Audiologist . Patients control group undergo Phase II COSI process part follow audiologist , whereas test group complete Phase II COSI process schedule visit refer physician follow-up audiologist . Participants recruit investigate audiologists ' clinic Vancouver . The study involvement time participant extend period 90 day . Routine Clinical Practice A complete hearing aid fitting take place course several clinic visit average 30-45 minute duration . These include initial hearing test consultation , actual fitting , subsequent post-fitting adjustment . During hear evaluation post-fitting follow-up session , COSI questionnaire use audiologists part routine clinical practice guide optimal hear aid adjustment meet patient 's listening need . Time schedule The time take fit hearing aid varies depend needs patient . Very often client age 55 problem dexterity , memory health impairment extend length individual consultation . Some patient require clinic consultation others . Anecdotally estimate maximal number visit require complete hearing aid fitting process 10 visit 90 day . These visit average 30 minute duration except initial final visit last 45 minute . A patient spend maximum 330 minute complete hearing aid fitting process 25 minute relate study specific procedure . Subjects Patients refer General practitioner Otolaryngologists hear aid fitting office two Audiologists meet inclusion criterion provide detail study include participant information consent form initial evaluation . Study Procedures Recruitment Patients satisfy inclusion criterion invite participate study complete study consent form . Allocation Consenting patient assign study ID randomize Control Test group use table random number . Intervention Process Consenting patient randomise use random number table post-fitting visit day 21 60 initial hearing aid fitting Audiologist ( Control group ) refer Physician ( Test Group ) . At visit audiologist physician document degree hear change specific listen environment/situations result hear aid use follow COSI questionnaire . This visit maximum 30 minute . A follow-up visit nature part routine clinical practice participate audiologist . The physician visit novel study intervention patient return subsequent follow-ups hearing aid fit audiologist keep routine clinical practice . Patient data collect Demographics : • age , sex Clinical data : • degree hearing loss Data Analysis The primary indicator patient satisfaction score 15-item SADL questionnaire . The Statistical Program Social Sciences use undertake t-test ANOVA comparison mean total SADL questionnaire score Control Test group . The secondary outcome measure hear aid return , assess Chi-squared test proportion return hear aid return group .</detailed_description>
