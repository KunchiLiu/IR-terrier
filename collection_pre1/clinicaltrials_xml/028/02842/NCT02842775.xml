	<detailed_description>Taiwan quickly become nation age population myelopathy report one common spinal cord disorder associate spinal degeneration . Given high prevalence rate condition , current project aim investigate impact myelopathy motor control biomechanical perspective overall aim develop interactive balance perturbation rehabilitation program target individual patient identified deficiency . The efficacy individual rehabilitation program assess determine utilizing prospective longitudinal study design . A break propose three year project follow : Year 1 : Myelopathy patient undergo cervical decompression surgery well age-matched asymptomatic control recruit subject follow clinical evaluation : 3-dimensional biomechanical motion analysis , diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging , pain disability questionnaire , motor performance assessment , spinal curvature well muscle strength assessment . Motor control coordination functional movement evaluate . Year 2 : Continue recruit potential participant develop use interactive split-belt balance perturbation treadmill modality gait balance therapy . Year 3 : Physical Therapy rehabilitation program 3 month post surgery , one group participate specific personalized interactive balance perturbation train program target balance gait retraining , group receive routine Physical Therapy program . Both treatment group assess pre-operatively , 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively . Patients classify base severity grade spinal cord compression compare difference treatment response . Year 4 : Follow-up monitoring document number fall experience patient one year postoperatively outcome effectiveness . Expected outcome significance The finding current project provide important empirical evidence guide postoperative rehabilitation myelopathy patient . Through detailed biomechanical motion analysis , anticipate project provide in-depth understanding influence decompression surgery motor control spinal stability . The tailored innovative rehabilitation program also improve patient ' long term quality life .</detailed_description>
