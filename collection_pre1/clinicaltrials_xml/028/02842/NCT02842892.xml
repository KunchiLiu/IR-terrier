	<brief_summary>For optimal jumping performance adequate interaction muscle tendon require . A parameter functional evaluation structure stiffness ( resistance tissue deformation external force ) . It unclear far high stiffness value tendon muscle specific stiffness relation tissue cause good jumping performance . The present study examines base Achilles tendon calf muscle patellar tendon hamstring three different form jump ( squat jump , counter-Movement Jump , Drop-Jump ) . The plan include young healthy volunteer age 18 40 year . In cross-sectional study , jump height participant measure jump form : squat jump ( jump squat position ) , Counter-Movement Jump ( jump backswing go knee ) drop jump ( jump small box direct re-jump ) . The order jump form determine randomly . The measurement carry within one day . Furthermore international physical activity questionnaire use order assess level physical activity . As primary outcome stiffness calf muscle , achilles tendon , hamstring patellar tendon detect . The measurement carry jump ( three jump one sample jump perform ) . The measurement execute non-invasively completely painless use Indentometers MyotonPro . With device , minimal pressure examine tissue exert measure much compress .</brief_summary>
