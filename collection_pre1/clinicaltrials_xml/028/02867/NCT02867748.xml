	<brief_title>TVT-ABBREVO Versus SERASIS Treatment Female Urinary Stress Incontinence : 1 Year Outcomes Comparative Study With 2 Trans-obturator Sub Mid Urethral Slings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The International Uro-gynecological Association ( IUGA ) International Continence Society ( ICS ) define urinary stress incontinence ( USI ) urine loss condition effort , physical exertion sport activity , sneeze coughing1 . USI life threaten condition , yet , leave untreated , might significant negative impact quality life many patient . According epidemiologic study woman 's age , multi-parity menopausal status risk factor USI1,2.Treatment option offer change life style , nonsurgical modality pelvic floor muscle train useful mitigate discomforting symptom . However , upon failure conservative treatment , surgery recommend woman unsuccessful cop USI3 . Intravaginal sling-plasty retro-pubic surgical procedure report Ulf Ulmsten Peter Petrous 1995 treat urinary stress incontinence4 . Soon , study do new procedure call TVT , conclude safe efficient ambulatory procedure4-6 . This lead major change uro-gynecologic operation preference , base mainly open retro-pubic operation hand . Trans-obturator sub mid urethral tape procedure ( TOT ) treat female urinary stress incontinence report then-after , first Delorme 7 , De Leval 8 . The TOT procedure design order minimize incidence TVT related adverse effect might severely impede patient 's rehabilitation health , urinary tract injury , urinary outlet obstruction , bowl penetration intra-operative bleeding9,10 . The TOT procedure ' efficacy claim non-inferior TVT , therefore become greatly adopt uro-gynecologists world-wide9 . The fact TOT needle pass medial compartment obturator fossa 2.5-3.0 cm obturator vessels nerve , might explain incidental post-operative thigh pain10 . Despite fact TOT report low complication rate , still complaints post-operative thigh groin pain well dyspareunia11 . Study mini TVT , single incision sling n't pass obturator membrane , prove reduced post-operative pelvic thigh pain , yet many surgeon reluctant use mini TVT implant reduce cure rate . Dyspareunia , however , occur TVT , TOT mini TVT procedures cause concern sexually active patients11 . Thus TOT procedures frequently perform thigh groin pain constantly common complication cause trans-obturator passage sling close obturator nerve . The typical TOT post-operative pain thigh , uni bilateral , yet describe even lumbar spine hip region . This might due patient 's hips position operation , likely intra-operative obturator nerve injury post-operative nerve impact , due direct pressure tape foreign body reaction9 . Jean De Leval , Alexandre Thomas David Waltregny propose modify TOT , TVT-Abbrevo ( Ethicon J &amp; J Somerville , NJ , USA ) . The polypropylene tape 's length reduce 12 cm . The TVT-Abbrevo develop order avoid extensive tape trans-obturator traumatic passage , reduce amount mesh aponeurotic tissue , way reduce postoperative pain thigh groin areas9 . Their result show group underwent modify TVT-Abbrevo procedure experience less pain day 0 TVT-Obturator group thereafter 9,12 . In addition thigh groin pain , Sue Ross , clinical study concern find indicative number woman TOT group palpable polypropylene tape vaginal examination one year surgery13 . These finding rather concern risk factor unfavorable outcome tape surgeries completely understood . It hard state whether palpable tape lead erosion get absorb vaginal tissue result complications13,14 . The Serasis ( Serag-Wiessner , Naila , Germany ) launch potential beneficiary impact especially soft knit sling implant occurrence severity post-operative pain . The ratio behind notion tape softness reduce tissue trauma tape introduce obturator plat maybe less fibrotic tissue reaction well . There comparative study perform effectiveness Serasis tape implantation anti-USI procedure , neither comparison polypropylene tape . Aims study : In prospective study investigator wish aim compare Serasis TVT-Abbrevo , use treatment USI . Firstly , investigator evaluate feasibility , safety curative rate procedure include post-operative immediate long term pain level well dyspareunia group . Secondly , investigator evaluate difference ability palpate Serasis TVT-Abbrevo tape vaginal examination group one year post surgery . In study investigator focus attention rigidity Serasis tape versus common polypropylene tape , provide TVT-Abbrevo . In addition , investigator evaluate significance previously report phenomena vaginal palpability TVT one year implantation 13,14 . Study Hypothesis : Previous study show TVT-Abbrevo cause less immediate post-operative thigh groin pain find long term12 . This current study hypothesis gently knit , Serasis tape , would superior TVT-Abbrevo tape , term post-operative pain level severity . Investigators think Serasis might effective solution state post-operative complication due soft monofilament non-absorbable polypropylene tape . The author presumes : 1 . The objective subjective curative rate around 85 % Serasis group TVT-Abbrevo group . 2 . Early postoperative pain level , cause probably operative trauma , Serasis TVT-Abb group patient . 3 . The long term post-operative pain level , dyspareunia ability palpate implant tape vaginal examination reduce Serasis patient ' group comparison TVT-Abbrevo group patient . Study significance : Results study provide important limited information regard Serasis TVT-Abbrevo tape , efficacy , immediate long term post-operative outcome vaginal tape palpability exposure . This data might improve surgeon 's decision making patient ' outcome satisfaction . If adverse clinical postoperative outcome find reduce gently knit sling , patient care quality life might improve well . Methods : 1 . Study design : This double arm , prospective randomize comparative study . Randomization do anesthesiologist flip coin right begin procedure . The enrolled patient give detailed , open transparent thorough data regard study . Patients sign inform consent get randomize onto one two study group , either Serasis TVT-Abbrevo . The operation perform general anesthesia patient discharge 8 hour surgery . The operation perform accord previously medially deviate trans-obturator needle passage11 . Data download patient 's medical chart collect interview use 3 questionnaire ( Pain Q , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 ) physical exam . 1 . Pre-operation : interview+ physical exam+ ( Pain Q , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 ) . 2 . Intra-operative estimate feasibility safety : needle passage ease adjustment ( VAS system ) , estimate blood loss ( CC ) . 3 . Before discharge hospital : chart data download , interview+ physical exam+ pain questionnaire . 4 . Early postoperative follow : interview pain questionnaire telephone 1st post-operative day . 5 . 1 month follow : interview+ physical exam+ Pain Q , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 questionnaire , palpability score determine physical exam . 6 . 3 month follow : interview telephone+ Pain Q , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 questionnaires 7 . 12 month follow : interview + Pain Q , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 questionnaire , physical exam include objective palpability score determination . Data collect , review investigated researcher . Data collection : 1 year ; Data processing : 2 month ; Statistical analysis : 2 month ; Writing final thesis : 2 month Duration study plan 2 year start 2015 . 2 . Subjects : Inclusion criterion : Women suffer urinary incontinence physical exertion prove clinical examination . This study plan include 100 patient , 50 woman group- Serasis TVT-Abbrevo , base assumption 50 % difference pain level two patient 's group . The exclusion criterion : 1 . Women young 30 old 80 year old . 2 . Women surgical procedure involve pelvic floor , either treatment USI Pelvic Organ Prolapse ( POP ) . 3 . Women suffer advanced POP ( POP-Quantification system ( POP-Q ) stage 2 ) . 4 . Patients absent incomplete medical record . 5 . Women refuse participate study . 6 . Women able give inform consent participate randomize research study reason . 3 . Variables : Demographic data collect age , background illness , etc.. Preoperative / Intraoperative /Postoperative data collection : medical chart record , questionnaire quality life , urogenital sexual functioning , surgical procedure undertaken , clinical postoperative analysis , pain level intra post-operative complication evaluate use ( VAS ) . Pain location , severity , onset duration determine thorough examination main researcher . The ability palpate polypropylene tape vaginal examination examine well ( VAS ) . The primary outcome measure cure failure operation , well adverse effect dyspareunia pain . This base upon interview questionnaire . The second outcome measure ability palpate polypropylene tape vaginal examination . Statistical method : Quantitative data present use mean standard deviation , median Ranges , qualitative data present use frequency percentage . Comparison quantity data group examine comparison test : Independent sample t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test , appropriate . Qualitative data compare among / group use Chi square test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . Changes time examine . Quantity data compare Repeated measurer , Freidman test , pair sample t-test Wilcoxon sign rank test , appropriate . Ordinal data compare Freidman test Wilcoxon sign rank test , Qualitative data compare mainly McNemar test . Sample size calculation : recovering sufficient information investigator need 100 patient study order meet power 80 % estimation 50 % difference pain level . Estimation feasibility safety procedure : blood loss ( CC ) , needle passage ease ( VAS ) .
