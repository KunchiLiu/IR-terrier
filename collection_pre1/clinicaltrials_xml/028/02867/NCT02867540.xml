	<brief_summary>Nearly three-quarters patient Crohn 's disease small bowel involvement 80 % complication require surgical procedure , usually ileocolonic resection ileocolonic anastomosis . The rate recurrence anastomosis site ileum surgery , whether symptomatic , high , least 60 % one year 80 % within three year . The gold standard monitoring ileocolonoscopy , endoscopic surveillance recommend patient , 6 12 month surgery every 2 year . The MRI enterography validate technique assessment small bowel Crohn 's disease . The enterography MRI validate technique assessment small bowel Crohn 's disease . The MRI enteroclysis evaluate two study compare endoscopy , excellent performance term recurrence detection sensitivity suggest alternative avoid invasive procedure repeat patient . The MRI enterography ( without enteroclysis ) provide good distension bowel loop MRI enteroclysis relies principle oral ingestion prior examination large amount liquid . However , much well tolerated patient , involve radiation exists enteroclysis , much simpler use require special equipment magnetic field .</brief_summary>
