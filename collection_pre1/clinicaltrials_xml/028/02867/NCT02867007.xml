	<brief_title>KHK2455 Alone Combination With Mogamulizumab Subjects With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design 2-part , multicenter , open-label , Phase 1 , dose-escalation , cohort-expansion study KHK2455 monotherapy run-in ( Cycle 0 ) follow combination therapy anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab ( Cycle 1 beyond ) . Part 1 identify MTD high protocol-defined dose , absence exceed MTD , KHK2455 monotherapy run-in combination regimen ( KHK2455 monotherapy [ Cycle 0 ] follow KHK2455 + mogamulizumab combination [ Cycle 1 ] ) . The dose escalation phase ( Part 1 ) enroll approximately 36 subject . Part 2 , cohort-expansion phase , explore safety , tolerability , PK , PD , preliminary anti-tumor activity KHK2455 administer monotherapy combination mogamulizumab subject one cohort-specific tumor type . In Part 2 , approximately 15 subject select tumor type enrol treat recommended KHK2455 dose establish Part 1 combination mogamulizumab .</detailed_description>
