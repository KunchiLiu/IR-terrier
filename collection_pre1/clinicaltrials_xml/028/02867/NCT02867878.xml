	<detailed_description>Takotsubo syndrome heart condition characterize rapid onset leave ventricular dysfunction , usually reversible , meet follow diagnostic criterion : - Transient alteration regional contractility myocardial wall right leave ventricle , frequently , always , precede stressful event ( emotional physical ) . - The regional change contractility myocardial wall , often extend beyond distribution single coronary vessel , often result circumferential ventricular dysfunction involve segment . - Absence culprit coronary lesion ( eg . Of atherosclerotic plaque rupture , thrombus formation , coronary dissection ) pathological condition may explain regional change contractility myocardial wall ( eg . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , viral myocarditis ) - Reversible electrocardiographic abnormality EKG ( ST-T segment elevation depression , new onset leave bundle branch block , inversion wave / QTc elongation ) acute phase ( 3 month ) . - Significant increase serum natriuretic peptide ( BNP NT-proBNP ) acute phase - Troponin significant increase , relatively small , ( disparity degree leave ventricular dysfunction value troponin ) . - The recovery leave ventricular function follow-up ( 3-6 month ) . Epidemiology Since Takotsubo syndrome describe first time 1991 , incidence , pass year increase , thanks possibility network treatment acute myocardial infarction , early access coronary angiography study . Currently syndrome account 2 % acute coronary syndrome undergo coronary angiography . Pathophysiology The pathophysiology Takotsubo syndrome complex , fully clarify . There several cause suggest year explain occurrence syndrome ( vascular / myocardial ) . One mechanism suggest systemic response , body , severe stress cause sudden increase catecholamine endogenous exogenous ; increase effect cardiovascular system lead acute heart failure . Stress one common cause behind onset syndrome , emotional stress ( eg . Mourning , quarrel , etc . ) physical ( eg . Surgical emergency , obstetric psychiatric ) , always present condition . Recent case report clinical study show patient syndrome may experience reversible damage coronary microcirculation , could basis important ventricular dysfunction observe patient . This characteristic may play significant role management patient . In fact target therapy rapid recovery coronary microcirculation function subsequent improvement leave ventricular function could reduce prevent complication related case . Complications During acute phase Takotsubo Syndrome incidence complication frequent ( 18-34 % involvement right ventricle ; obstruction leave ventricular outflow 12-54 % ; mitral regurgitation 14-25 % , 9-20 % cardiogenic shock , ventricular thrombus 2-8 % , 5-15 % atrial fibrillation , ventricular arrhythmia 4-9 % , 2-5 % bradycardia-asystole ) complication often consequence leave ventricular dysfunction . In fact , presence major depression ejection fraction ( EF ) main cause complication patient Takotsubo slow pace recovery normal EF closely connect risk complication . Diagnosis Takotsubo syndrome diagnosis require , basic examination , coronary angiography ( allow u exclude coronary artery disease highlight presence typical pattern `` apical balloon '' ventriculography ) echocardiogram ( allow u highlight regional alteration leave ventricular kinetics ) . Risk Stratification Patients diagnosis Takotsubo syndrome make , stratify accord risk profile patient high low risk Therapy Recently European Society Cardiology prepare document suggest therapy perform patient Takotsubo syndrome accord risk stratification clinical echocardiographic data , base consensus among author absence current randomized clinical study support strategy . Mortality The data available report in-hospital ( 1-4.5 % ) 5 year ( 3-17 % ) mortality non-negligible . Follow-up A recovery ventricular function show 3-6 month acute event Rationale study In patient symptomatic Takotsubo , therapeutic strategy currently use design address , pathophysiological mechanism underlie event , complication face patient ( ie acute heart failure , arrhythmias hyperkinetic leave ventricular thrombosis ) . No data currently available targeted therapy treatment Takotsubo syndrome . Adenosine extracellular signal molecule play fundamental role human physiology . Its main effect : vascular vasodilation , regulation activity sympathetic nervous system , antithrombotic regulating blood pressure heart rate . One main us adenosine cardiovascular field production vasodilation coronary microcirculation produce hyperemia , example assessment intermediate coronary stenosis use fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . It also find use even course acute myocardial infarction reduce phenomenon slow-flow course primary angioplasty , even result study currently available unambiguous interpretation . Galiuto et al . demonstrate , regardless underlie etiology , patient Takotsubo syndrome , show presence acute reversible vasoconstriction coronary microcirculation , may represent common pathophysiologic mechanism patient . In study investigator underline also use systemic infusion adenosine dose 140 microgram / kg / min 90 second determines initial improvement , statistically significant , leave ventricular function patient . The study observational , take consideration clinical outcome . Numerous study perform patient STEMI ( ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ) show adenosine infusion system , although high dos , cause mild adverse effect ( e . dyspnea , chest pain , transient ventricular atrium block , hypotension ) quick resolution suspension infusion . Objective study The objective study demonstrate patient Takotsubo syndrome diagnosis , use adenosine infusion high dos , immediately diagnosis disease , absence documentation coronary artery disease , able enhance EF patient 48 hour diagnosis , compare standard therapy . Study Design It multicenter , randomize , single-blind study , phase IIa . Once coronary angiography demonstrate absence coronary artery disease confirm diagnosis Takotsubo syndrome patient undergo baseline echocardiography randomize , use randomization system electronic , 1 : 1 receive : - Systemic infusion adenosine 140μg / kg / min 3 minute + standard therapy - Placebo ( saline 3 minute ) + standard therapy Randomization stratify follow variable : - gender ( male vs. female ) - age ( &lt; 65 year vs. ≥65 year ) The standard therapy , allocate base risk stratification patient enrol . Patients assess echocardiography 24 hour , 48 hour 1 month accord parameter give echocardiographic analysis section . All patient follow clinical follow-up one year . PRESPECIFIED SUBSTUDY As show previous study , patient Takotsubo syndrome reversible coronary microvascular damage . The purpose study ass whether infusion high-dose adenosine e.v favor improvement leave ventricular ejection function quickly . With sub-study want evaluate , also , also series damage coronary microcirculation . Patients participate sub-study , randomize Adenosine arm , evaluation coronary microcirculation perform calculate IMR ( microcirculatory resistance index ) infusion adenosine require randomization . The IMR validate method measure function coronary microcirculation . By use previously position guide pressure leave anterior descendent ( LAD ) coronary artery , IMR evaluate thermodilution technique analyze transit time predetermine quantity ( 3 ml ) saline room temperature inject coronary artery . 3 consecutive injection 3 mL saline solution perform baseline , evaluate average transit time rest ( Tmn ) . Later , maximal hyperemia induce systemic infusion Adenosine a140μg / kg / min , 3 new injection saline room temperature perform , mean transit temple hyperemia ( Tmnhyp ) measure . Tmnhyp multiply average value distal coronary pressure ( Pd ) register maximal hyperemia , get IMR value ( IMR : Tmnhyp x Pd ) consider normal range less 25 . A value 25 indicate presence damage coronary microcirculation .</detailed_description>
