	<brief_title>Intra-Operative Corticosteroid Injection During Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design ass whether subacromial injection corticosteroid time arthroscopic shoulder surgery influence quality life score activity level compare control group . The hypothesis intra-operative subacromial corticosteroid injection arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery provide rapid improvement quality life score activity level post-operative period compare control . The study placebo-controlled , double-blind prospective study . All patient necessitate arthroscopic shoulder surgery present Dr. Keith Baumgarten 's clinic eligible participation . If patient meet inclusion criterion , inform consent obtain participation study . Each patient undergo standard shoulder exam ass active range motion complete demographic pre-operative patient determine outcome survey ( 1 . Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand ( DASH ) 2 . Simple Assessment Numeric Evaluation ( SANE ) 3 . Western Ontario Rotator Cuff ( WORC ) ) Marx shoulder activity level survey ( MARX ) . Patients undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery . After arthroscopic surgery experimental group undergo subacromial corticosteroid injection + marcaine control group undergo subacromial marcaine injection . Outcomes assess use quality life survey activity level survey post-operative visit time interval : 2 week 3 month U.S. mail 5 month 1 year . Active range motion assess post-operative visit : 2 week , 6 week , 3 month . Subjects meet criterion undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery provide informed consent receive either subacromial corticosteroid injection placebo injection end surgery . Patients expect complete pre- post-operative quality life survey activity level survey . It take less 20 minute complete list survey pre- post-operative visit . Active range motion assess post-operative visit subject expect take part physical examination well . The duration subject participation 1 year date initial surgery .</detailed_description>
