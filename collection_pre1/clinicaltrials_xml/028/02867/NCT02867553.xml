	<brief_summary>Cutaneous lymphoma frequent extranodal lymphomas digestive lymphoma . A quarter B-cell lymphoma . 80 % cutaneous B cell lymphoma indolent cutaneous B cell lymphoma . These indolent cutaneous B cell lymphomas characterize good prognosis ( survival rate 5 year : 90 % ) , also frequency cutaneous recurrence . The radiotherapy currently widely use treatment , complete response rate close 100 % lesion treat . However , limit outset multiple lesion inaccessible single radiotherapy field ( concern one case three ) , recurrence . In situation , conventional chemotherapy recommend multi-field radiotherapy often use empirically , effectiveness never study prospectively . Recently , retrospective study small number patient ( total sixty patient ) report complete response rate 80 100 % rituximab ( anti-cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) antibody ) use monotherapy non-standardized treatment intravenous recurrence rate le one case three . These data suggest rituximab intravenous standardized initial cycle follow maintenance therapy could improve prognosis indolent cutaneous B cell lymphomas multiple lesion recurrent lesion .</brief_summary>
