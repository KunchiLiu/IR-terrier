	<brief_summary>Feeding problem common among baby bear preterm medical condition . It yet know baby admit neonatal unit risk feed problem . Studies show degree prematurity presence additional health problem make feed difficulty likely . However , research always agree health problem associate feed problem many study prematurity exclude baby complex health problem . Additionally , baby complex health problem feed problem premature . This study aim answer question 'Is gestational age medical status well indicator risk feed difficulty ? ' This research study baby admit Royal Preston Hospital Neonatal Unit 2015 use routinely collect data store BadgerNet , patient data management system . Coded data collect follow variable : gestational age category ( extremely preterm , preterm , moderate-late preterm , term ) , medical status number type bodily system health issue , feed outcome ( full oral feed 37 week , 40 week , discharge , discharge home tube feed ) . Appropriate statistical test use determine presence absence correlation gestation age medical variable feed outcome . Information study use inform neonatal service delivery ( include Speech Language Therapy referral criterion caseload prioritization ) area need research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Which Infants Neonatal Unit Are Most Risk Feeding Difficulties ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know incidence feed problem high neonatal population certain patient group appear particularly risk . It yet know infant group admit Level 3 Neonatal Units risk feed problem need specialist feed assessment intervention . While many study examine impact prematurity additional medical problem feed outcome , study date limit sub-populations , and/or investigate best identify baby risk feed difficulty . Neonatal Speech Language Therapists require information feeding risk outcomes neonatal population whole caseload prioritization target population need specialist feeding intervention . Babies bear extremely preterm ( 28 week gestational age ) low birth weight ( less 1500 gram birth ) identify slow achieve full oral feed born old gestational age high birth weight . Certain medical problem find correlate feed outcome preterms . Impaired respiratory function , gastrointestinal complication , neurological involvement , heart defect associate delayed feeding progression poor feeding outcome . This study aim determine gestational age birth number type medical condition well indicator risk feed disorder infant admit Level 3 neonatal unit . Design : Prognostic study use retrospective case note analysis . Setting : A Level 3 Neonatal Unit ( include intensive care , high dependency , special care ) Royal Preston Hospital . Procedure : A retrospective audit routinely collect data undertaken analyse . The BadgerNet patient record management system update daily baby neonatal unit around country . Data collect BadgerNet daily note discharge summary add bespoke spreadsheet prior statistical analysis . Data collection conduct member Royal Preston Hospital Neonatal Unit clinical team . No patient identifiable data collect . Data list spreadsheet random order ensure possibility anyone , include clinical researcher , trace cod data back infant . Data storage : The spreadsheet cod variable store password protect folder accessible clinical researcher . In order move spreadsheet University Central Lancashire computer system statistical analysis , email secure/encrypted form save restricted drive password protect folder accessible clinical researcher statistician . Information include spreadsheet include : - Gestational age category ( coded 1-4 ) - Medical status - number system involve ( cod 1-5 ) type ( cod 1-27 ) - Full oral feed 37 week 40 week ( cod 1-3/1-4 ) Coding : Gestational age category : 1 . Extremely preterm : &lt; 28 week 2 . Very preterm : 28-31+6 week 3 . Moderate late preterm : 32-36+6 week 4 .

Information available ( exclude analysis ) Feeding difficulty ( baby ) : 1 . Yes - achieved oral feed 40 week discharge 2 . Yes - discharge home tube feed 3 . Information available ( exclude analysis ) Operational Definitions : Gestational age group base category use World Health Organisation : - Extremely preterm : &lt; 28 week - Very preterm : 28-31+6 week - Moderate late preterm : 32-36+6 week - Term : 37 weeks+ Medical status categorize number impaired body system follow list : neurological , respiratory , gastrointestinal , cardiac , craniofacial . Following thorough literature review , five system identify commonly related feeding difficulty . Presence/absence involvement system determine patient discharge letter BadgerNet . This letter complete medical doctor include section list system . If problem list system heading record positive , regardless severity duration . Exceptions include follow : retinopathy prematurity , transient tachypnea newborn , intraventricular hemorrhage grade 1-2 , brachial plexus injury respiratory compromise . Slow attainment full oral feeding define inability achieve full oral feeding : - 37 week post-menstrual age ( full term ) - Discharge home ( earlier 37 week ) - Within one week birth bear 36 week Feeding difficulty define inability achieve full oral feeding : - 40 week post-menstrual age ( due date ) - Discharge home earlier 40 week , - Within one week birth bear 39 week . Analysis : Descriptive statistic appropriate statistical test use determine presence absence correlation variable . Outcomes strong correlation identify analysed use logistic regression model .</detailed_description>
