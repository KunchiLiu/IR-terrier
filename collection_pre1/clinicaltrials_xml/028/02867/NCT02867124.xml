	<brief_title>Long-acting Naltrexone Pre-release Prisoners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disorders involve opioid use severe problem among jail prison inmate . Inmates US , Canada , Australia , many European Asian nation disproportionately high rate opioid use disorder general population . Scarce resource provide corrections-based substance use treatment many nation , many inmate OUDs remain untreated . The use long-acting , injectable naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) may promise form treatment pre-release prisoner . Naltrexone block intoxicate reinforce effect opioids , opioid-like effect . This propose five-year study focus whether addition provide XR-NTX treatment patient ' place residence increase adherence thus efficacy medication . Project implementation occur five pre-release prison jurisdiction Maryland Department Public Safety Correctional Services ( MDPSCS ) : 1 ) Metropolitan Transition Center ( MTC ) men ; 2 ) Baltimore Pre-Release Unit ( BPRU ) men ; 3 ) Jessup Pre-Release Unit ( JPRU ) men ; 4 ) Baltimore City Correctional Center ( BCCC ) 5 ) Maryland Correctional Institution ( MCI ) Women . Following initial screening , informed consent , medical examination , pre-release prisoner facility block randomize ( N=240 ) within gender either : Condition 1 . XR-NTX-OTx ( n=120 ) : One injection XR-NTX prison , follow six monthly injection post-release community opioid treatment program ; Condition 2 . XR-NTX+MMTx ( n=120 ) : One injection XR-NTX prison , follow six monthly injection post-release community patient 's place residence . All participant confirm opiate-free urine test negative naloxone oral naltrexone test , evaluate monthly seven month 12 month release prison . The propose study two specific aim : Aim1 . To compare two study condition term : ) XR-NTX treatment adherence ; b ) opioid use ; c ) criminal activity ; ) re-arrest ; e ) re-incarceration ; f ) HIV risk-behaviors ( i. needle use ; ii . risky sexual behavior ) . Aim 2 . To determine number month post-release XR-NTX treatment relate outcome ( a-f ) , , point XR-NTX v. Non-XR-NTX equilibrates ? This would help determine number injection , important XR-NTX cost . Many individual criminal justice system drop treatment therefore increase way improve adherence attempting : 1 ) expand capacity ; 2 ) implement access provide treatment place residence may positively impact outcome .</detailed_description>
