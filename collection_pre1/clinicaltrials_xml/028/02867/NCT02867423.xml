	<brief_summary>The CyberKnife ( CK ) develop recently . This linear accelerator carry industrial robot . It , due tumor track capability high accuracy , interest irradiation ( boost ) tumor site conventional irradiation . The radiation boost currently issue electron , proton brachytherapy . These technique require several fraction associate cutaneous toxicity aesthetic problem . CK interest reduce number fraction reduction dose deliver skin . CK use phase I protocol ( CYBERNEO ) concomitant chemotherapy inoperable breast tumor prove effectiveness safety treatment . The investigator consider conduct Phase II protocol single dose 8 Grays issue CK boost tumor site conventional breast irradiation . The result , term local control , evaluate clinical monitoring .</brief_summary>
