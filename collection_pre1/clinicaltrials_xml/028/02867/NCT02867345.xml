	<brief_title>PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dose-escalation study ex-vivo knocked-out , expand , select PD-1 knockout-T cell autologous origin . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group determine maximal tolerant dose . After low number cycle consider tolerant , arm next high number cycle open next patient . Biomarkers immunological marker collect analyzed well .</detailed_description>
