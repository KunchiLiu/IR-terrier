	<detailed_description>Aggressive fibromatosis ( AF ) rare non-metastasizing connective tissue tumor ( &lt; 300 cases/year France ) , associate high risk local relapse , functional impairment pain . AF occur age , commonly 25 40 significant female predominance . AF frequently ( 85 % ) sporadic associate somatic mutation CTNNB1 gene . AF associate heredity condition , complication familial adenomatous polyposis ( germinal mutation Adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene ) . Most AF arises lims abdominal wall . Nevertheless , particular location life-threatening ( mesenteric cervical location ) . The natural course AF unpredictable . One third tumor spontaneously stable . One third tumor spontaneously decrease . One third tumor progressive , non-linear tumor growth dynamic . As consequence decision make start curative intent treatment difficult , since treatment could mutilate ( large en bloc surgery ) associate late severe complication ( radiotherapy ) since treatment could fail control benign tumor . Therapeutic option : wait-and-see policy , surgery ( sometimes mutilate ) , radiotherapy systemic treatment ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , hormonotherapy , imatinib , chemotherapy ) . Level evidence associate option low , base retrospective study rare non-randomized phase II clinical trial . Regarding uncertainty , physician hardly answer patient question . Prospective data provide large multi-center cohort need . The objective present study create large cohort incident case AF associate tumor bank collection blood sample .</detailed_description>
