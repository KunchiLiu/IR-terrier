	<brief_title>A Study Obinutuzumab Prevention Chronic Graft-vs.-Host Disease After Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Obinutuzumab prevention chronic Graft-vs.-Host Disease ( cGVHD ) , approve us . In research study , investigator aim determine effect Obinutuzumab incidence corticosteroid-requiring cGVHD allogeneic Hematopoetic Cell Transplant ( aHCT ) . Chronic GVHD medical condition occur bone marrow stem cell transplant one individual another . After transplant , donor immune system may recognize recipient body foreign may attempt 'reject ' body . This process refer Graft-vs. -Host Disease may occur time , although generally early one hundred day transplantation . The immune system produce two type lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) , B cell T cell . B cell part 'memory ' immune system , make antibody ( protein ) bacteria , virus potentially harmful material enter body . Obinutuzumab antibody , molecule target certain cell bind specific part target cell . In case , Obinutuzumab bind component B cell call CD20 , result B cell get kill . It think reduce number B cell reduce chance develop cGVHD transplant . Previous study another antibody target CD20 B cell suggest may reduce chance develop cGVHD need prescribe Corticosteroids treat cGVHD B cell kill . This randomized , placebo control trial . This mean approximately half study participant receive Obinutuzumab , half receive placebo ( saline solution ) . A computer decide participant receive Obinutuzumab placebo , neither participant study doctor know participant receive study complete . It important note current standard receive therapy specifically prevent cGVHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects deem potentially eligible treat physician screen enrollment day +60 +90 transplantation Patients undergone either ablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation eligible . Peripheral blood stem cell must use stem cell source . Patients must receive transplantation donor ( relate unrelated ) identical 8 HLA locus ( A , B , C DR1 ) , mismatch 1 locus ( 7/8 ) . Among related donor , HLA C typing require ( 6/6 HLA match ) . Class I type perform PCRSSP technique CDC technique . Class II type perform PCRRFLP +/ PCRSSP technique . No evidence relapse residual malignancy within 30 day trial entry . All patient must undergo appropriate staging malignancy ( i.e . bone marrow aspiration Leukemias PETCT scan lymphoma ) . Evidence persistent Cytogenetic abnormality constitute evidence residual relapse disease Leukemias , present . Individuals CLL eligible 20 % residual leukemia bone marrow time study entry . Patients undergone nonmyeloablative stem cell transplant must &gt; 80 % donor hematopoiesis within 30 day study enrollment . Chimerism within 30 day study entry must great , equal , 5 % less chimerism measure approximately day+30 ( perform ) . Age ≥ 18.0 ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) ( See Appendix A ) Participants must normal marrow function define : WBC ≥ 3,000/μL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,500/μL Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . The effect Obinutuzumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion Obinutuzumab administration . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation use single multiple umbilical cord blood unit use bone marrow . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation use vivo ex vivo T cell depletion , either cell manipulation T cell deplete antibody ( Any antithymocyte globulin preparation alemtuzumab give within 30 day transplantation ) Participation clinical trial evaluate another preventative strategy chronic GVHD , ongoing participation clinical trial therapy acute GVHD . Prior completion experimental therapy acute GVHD permissible experimental agent use &gt; 30 day prior enrollment . Any evidence ongoing gastrointestinal hepatic acute GVHD , evidence great ongoing Stage I cutaneous acute GVHD . Ongoing , taper therapy resolve acute GVHD permissible . Any evidence prior active resolve chronic GVHD . History severe allergic reaction Obinutuzumab No Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ( DLI ) prior day 100 , plan DLI upcoming 30 day . Evidence active uncontrolled infection ( bacterial , viral fungal ) evidence natural exposure Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV . Evidence Hepatitis B exposure include presence Hepatitis B surface antigenemia , positive serological test Hepatitis B core antibody nucleic acid testing ( NAT test ) positive Hepatitis B. Vaccination Hepatitis B exclusion criterion . Pregnancy lactation . Negative pregnancy test require within screen window Active use investigational agent .</criteria>
