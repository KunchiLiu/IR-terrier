	<brief_summary>This piloting study use continuous motor training provide via whole body-controlled video game ( exergames ) establish proof-of-concept evidence training lead motor neural change pre-manifest subject spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Slowing Down Disease Progression Premanifest SCA : Piloting Interventional Exergame Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many neurodegenerative disease , include spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) , large population neuron already lose compensatory resource exhaust time clinical diagnosis . This call early intervention strategy aim slow disease progression already premanifest stage disease . Here propose world-first interventional study aim delay onset rare genetic neurodegenerative disease . Specifically , propose pilot study use continuous motor training provide via whole body-controlled video game ( exergames ) establish proof-of-concept evidence training lead motor neural change pre-manifest SCA subject . The subclinical effect unravel within intraindividual control study design elaborate quantitative Video Management System ( VICONÂ® ) -based movement analysis structural functional 3 Tesla ( T ) magnetic resonance imaging . This provide unique insight underlie motor neural network compensatory strategy . If successful , pilot trial provide basis rigorous international multi-center large-scale study large SCA population . Moreover , stimulate complementary tandem project effect motor train neural function molecular pathway premanifest SCA mouse model .</detailed_description>
