	<detailed_description>Introduction : Adenocarcinoma gallbladder ( GBCA ) common malignancy biliary tract incidence alarmingly high Indian subcontinent . Complete surgical excision standard care gallbladder pancreatic cancer . Unfortunately , majority cancer diagnose advanced , inoperable stage 10-30 % patient present resectable disease . Gall bladder cancer T3/T4 liver infiltration , without visceral/vascular infiltration large local lymph node metastasis ; absence distant metastases generally consider locally advanced . There prognosis term resectability survival remain dismal report . Even aggressive surgery like extrahepatic bile duct resection pancreaticoduodenectomy 5 year survival rate stage III disease range 30 % 42 % best report . But result often reproducible . Locally advanced Gall bladder cancer amenable curative resection often treat chemotherapy alone current standard care . Randomized trial show survival benefit combination chemotherapy gallbladder cancer . In randomized trial combination chemotherapy Gemcitabine cisplatin superior Gemcitabine chemotherapy alone local tumor response term partial downsize stable disease achieve 81 % case . With Gemcitabine Cisplatin base Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) locally advanced GB cancer get downstaged undergo resection . Recent publication Tata Memorial Centre , NACT alone give result surgical resection rate 43 % median OAS PFS 13 month 8 month . Study methodology : All patient diagnosis non metastatic locally advanced Gall bladder cancer fulfill study eligibility criterion evaluate study participation undergo Positron emission tomography contrast enhance computerized tomography ( PETCECT ) scan stag laparoscopy rule metastatic disease . Patients undergo upfront randomization one study arm . A proportion patient expect jaundice cholangitis presentation . At study inclusion clinical evidence active cholangitis unresolved biliary obstruction . Liver Function Tests , Renal Function Tests CA 19-9 within 4 week treatment initiation . Systemic Chemotherapy arm ( Standard Arm Arm A ) Those randomize NACT proceed receive systemic gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2delivered day 1 8 every 3 week cisplatin 25 mg/m2 4 cycle ( week 1- week 11 ) . Chemoradiation arm ( Study Arm Arm B ) The radiation dose 50-55 Gy/ 25 fraction gross disease 45 Gy/ 25 fraction suspect microscopic disease along weekly gemcitabine ( 300 mg/ m2 ) . Radiotherapy 5 week follow 2 cycle chemotherapy ( week 7 week 11 ) These radiotherapy ( RT ) dose found safe investigator pilot study . During week 12-13 patient undergo repeat PETCECT scan . If scan show partial good response patient evaluate surgery . Surgery possible do week 13-15 . In case inoperable disease patient receive chemotherapy . With locally progressive/systemic disease chemotherapy patient may consider second line palliative chemotherapy best supportive care . The use radical dose chemoradiation allow disease progression systemic chemotherapy arm . However palliative radiation may use . Surgery Surgical procedure en-bloc resection include cholecystectomy liver wedge excision periportal lymph node clearance . Nodal clearance station number 8 , 12 , 13 sample inter aortocaval node do . Extrahepatic biliary excision additional organ excision do per discretion operating surgeon . Post Surgery patient receive additional adjuvant chemotherapy Number patient enrol : Screened 350 Enrolled 314</detailed_description>
