	<brief_summary>Infertility consider disease World Health Organization , increase worldwide , affect 70 million couple . About 50 % case due male inability fertilize oocyte . In last 40 year , several technique , know Assisted Reproduction Technology ( ART ) develop treat infertility , efficiency still relatively low ( around 30 % success ) whereas remain 70 % attempts several time , expensive emotionally move treatment . Over 4million infertility treatment practice around world per year 50 % increment expect next 6years . Even though ART allow birth baby would impossible natural circumstance , still necessary improve procedure order increase treatment efficiency . The success ART depend , extent , sperm quality . Indeed , relevance spermatozoon quality notorious even beyond fertilization , extend embryo development implantation . In context , develop new technology allow selection spermatozoon best functional state ( Sperm Selection Assay , SSA ; Patent approve USA Europe , pending Japan Argentina ) . This method base attraction spermatozoon ready fertilize egg , towards physiological attractant molecule . The SSA may apply improve diagnosis infertility treatment . The investigator hypothesis state use SSA improve number good-quality embryos one transfer intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , provide healthy embryo development . The protocol involve three experimental group SSA use , perform ICSI : 1 ) SSA contain sperm attractant molecule , 2 ) SSA without attractant molecule , 3 ) without SSA . The patient inclusion criterion involve female factor associate tubal obstruction and/or endometriosis male factor associate sperm disability . Several outcome parameter determine , percentage fertilization , embryo quality , rate pregnancy rate birth . The study carry Universitarian Institute Reproductive Medicine ( IUMER ) recently establish public hospital depend National University CÃ³rdoba , offer free high complexity infertility treatment patient without health insurance economic support</brief_summary>
