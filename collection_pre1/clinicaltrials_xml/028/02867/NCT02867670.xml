	<brief_summary>TMS non-invasive brain stimulation technique , use change activity person 's brain cell without needle surgery . In study , invesigators interest brain 's ability adapt ( also call `` neuroplasticity '' ) regain language functioning stroke—specifically , want determine whether person 's brain respond TMS short term use predict well recover language ability long term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aphasia impairment language may occur stroke ( brain injury ) . A person aphasia may experience difficulty speak , understand speech , reading , write , combination symptom . Despite advance understanding language system functional neuroplasticity brain injury , accurate predictor aphasia recovery stroke remain elusive . In order well understand , predict , enhance language improvement stroke , critical need develop tool assess influence neuroplasticity recovery . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive brain stimulation tool use predict brain 's neuroplastic capacity assess physiological response observe immediately follow administration TMS . Additionally , difference physiological response TMS show affect polymorphism gene cod brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . The current project explore idea neural mechanism plasticity essential determinant recovery brain injury physiologic response TMS , magnetic brain stimulation could employ indicator capacity clinically relevant neuroplasticity , potentially predictor recovery post-stroke deﬁcits aphasia The goal protocol 1 ) explore utility theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) , type transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , tool assess neuroplasticity language system patient aphasia due stroke , 2 ) ass utility TBS biomarker predictor functional recovery patient aphasia . This protocol encompass two separate relate experiment . In ﬁrst experiment , investigator apply TBS brain region control language function aphasic patient order determine whether induce transient improvement name ability . They use statistical model develop categorize patient either High Plasticity Low Plasticity . The investigator determine whether distinction predict patient likely great TBS-induced change language performance . In second experiment , patient , investigator apply TBS motor cortex elicit change motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) . Using model form match group , predict MEPs attenuate High Plasticity group compare Low Plasticity group .</detailed_description>
