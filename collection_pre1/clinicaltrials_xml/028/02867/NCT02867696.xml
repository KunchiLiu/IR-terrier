	<brief_summary>The primary aim study examine effect apply minimal contact technology-based intervention ( TECH ) 1-year post-bariatric surgery weight change compare Standard Care . Forty participant 1-year post bariatric surgery randomize TECH Standard Care period 6 month ( 12 18 month post-surgery ) . Analyses conduct compare intervention difference body weight , body composition , fitness , physical activity , engagement , psychosocial measure , intervention cost cost-effectiveness approach . TECH consist wearable monitor provide feedback energy expenditure physical activity , electronic track dietary intake , integration electronic scale provide comprehensive feedback participant component weight management . TECH participant receive monthly telephone call intervention staff provide guidance weight management effort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial examine effect minimal contact technology-based system comparison standard care body weight adult 1 year post-bariatric surgery . This 6 month intervention conduct University Pittsburgh , Physical Activity Weight Management Research Center . Eligible participant obtain physician 's consent undergo baseline assessment . Assessments describe detail . Eligible participant complete baseline assessment procedure randomize one two intervention group : The minimal contact technology-based intervention use Jawbone UP3 System combine monthly intervention telephone call ( TECH ) , Standard Care . Standard Care serve treatment control project . Participants group receive typical care surgeon follow bariatric surgery . No additional intervention give participant randomize group . TECH Intervention : TECH experimental group project . A minimal-contact technology-based intervention weight management give group addition standard typical care receive surgeon follow bariatric surgery . The following information outline protocol intervention group . Dietary Component : Dietary recommendation base subject ' baseline body weight , calorie fat intake goal range 1200-2100 kcal/day 20-30 % daily calorie respectively . The calorie goal base intake recommendation show result successful short-term weight loss fat intake goal consistent USDA Dietary Guidelines . To facilitate adoption maintenance dietary intake goal , participant provide meal plan sample recipe . In addition , participant teach read food label provide The Calorie King Calorie , Fat , Carbohydrate Counter facilitate self-monitoring calorie fat intake . Intervention lesson send participant via email also include information related behavior strategy achieve desired calorie fat intake goal . Physical Activity Component : The physical activity component include unsupervised home-based exercise program . Participants ask perform aerobic physical activity recommend moderate intensity define 3-6 metabolic equivalent ( METS ) . This intensity similar brisk walking , however achieve aerobic-based activity participant ' choice . Equipment provide participant . To facilitate adoption intensity physical activity , participant provide target heart rate ( 60-70 % age-predicted maximal heart rate ) rating perceive exertion ( 11-13 15-category Borg Scale ) . Baseline physical activity participation evaluate intervention recommendation prescribe progress 250 minute per week 13th week intervention , consistent recommendation American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . Participants encourage complete prescribed dos physical activity week , daily goal achieve perform activity one continuous bout accumulate across several short bout least 10 minute duration . Intervention lesson send participant via email also include information related behavior strategy achieve desired activity goal study . Participants group provide Jawbone UP3 System . The Jawbone UP3 System include wearable device monitor physical activity energy expenditure transmit real-time feedback calorie expend physical activity directly smart phone contain web-interface/application . In addition , smart phone support self-monitoring dietary behavior body weight provide real-time feedback goal achievement . A digital smart scale also provide TECH participant . The smart scale ( Withings® , Inc. ) transmit objective measure body weight directly smart phone application also interfaces Jawbone UP3 System . All technology tool ( UP3 system combination smart scale ) allow self-monitoring energy expenditure , energy balance , physical activity , dietary intake , body weight occur real-time within integrated system . Participants attend one introductory session tutorial component Jawbone UP3 System smart scale provide . Individuals give confidential login code provide access website smart phone application . Login procedure well upload data Bluetooth® sync technology component demonstrate . Detailed write instruction also give illustrating procedure . Additionally , follow-up call within 1 week initial meeting occur make sure technology component work properly . TECH also initially receive one-hour lesson basic guideline weight management intervention . At time , caloric goal weekly physical activity recommendation explain . To support weight loss behavior , participant encourage use Jawbone UP3 System smart scale self-monitor dietary intake , physical activity , body weight . Participants TECH also receive schedule intervention telephone call study coach follow schedule : -Month 1 : One call per week first 4 week study . This support participants make change lifestyle behavior part intervention . Additionally , call use ensure technology function properly use intend study . Months 2-6 : One call per month . This call use provide continue intervention support addition . These telephone call take approximately 10-15 minute complete member intervention staff experience use Jawbone UP3 System smart scale train deliver behavioral telephone intervention . Strategies overcome weight-loss barrier primarily discuss , standardized script serve guide address technical difficulty use UP3 System smart scale , frequency technology usage , participant goal , barrier diet physical activity , monitor body weight . Interventionists access information upload web-interfaces UP3 System smart scale , allow interventionist review information prior facilitate interaction participant telephone call . The length telephone intervention record .</detailed_description>
