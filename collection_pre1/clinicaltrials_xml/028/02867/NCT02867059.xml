	<brief_summary>This single-centre , open-label , study use induced blood stage malaria ( IBSM ) infection characterize activity ( + ) -SJ000557733 SJ733 short , early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection . The study conduct two cohort ( n=8 per cohort ) . The anticipated efficacious dose range expect within range 125 600 mg . The dose use first cohort determine basis safety PK data generate FIM study ( NCT02661373 ) currently ongoing United States ( US ) 150 mg . Depending pharmacodynamics data ( effect SJ733 parasitaemia ) obtain first cohort , dose Cohort 2 may adjust exceed 600 mg. Based PK three cohort FIM study , median estimate dose obtain target SJ733 AUC 13,000 ( ug hr/L ) 370 mg . The dose cohort 2 ( ≤600mg ) intend provide concentration-response information human challenge model . For Cohort 2 , second dose SJ733 may administer peak gametocytaemia ass SJ733 reduce gametocyte subsequent infectivity mosquito ( washout ~15 day post initial SJ733 treatment observe ) . Depending data obtain first two cohort , may subsequent cohort , investigate dose SJ733 determine Sponsor Principal Investigator ( PI ) endorse Safety Review Team . Should third dose investigated , substantial amendment include preliminary data first two cohort submit HREC approval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SJ733 Induced Blood Stage Malaria Challenge Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each participant cohort inoculate Day 0 ~2,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocyte ( BSPC ) administer intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor daily via phone call attend clinic daily ( AM ) day 4 ( PCR positive presence malaria parasite ) . Once PCR positive monitor twice-daily , morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) treatment , adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . Microscopic examination evidence parasitaemia may conduct discretion Investigator . On day designate commencement treatment , determine qPCR result , participant admit study unit monitor . The threshold commencement treatment PCR quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL . If PCR quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL , accompany clinical symptom score &gt; 6 , participant reach treatment threshold ( PCR quantification ≥ 5,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Following treatment SJ733 , participant follow inpatient least 72 hour ensure tolerance treatment clinical response , outpatient basis clinically well , monitor safety clearance malaria parasites via PCR . The plasma concentration-time profile SJ733 assess blood sample collect pre-dose following administration treatment drug . Wherever possible , PK sample coincide post-dose blood collection PCR monitoring parasitaemia . Participants may also evaluate presence gametocyte blood , determine qPCR ( amplification pfs25 gametocyte-specific transcript ) . Transmission block activity SJ733 P. falciparum IBSM infection may assess &gt; 500 parasites/ml ( determined 18S qPCR ) verify gametocyte PCR pfs25 and/or ring stage marker appropriate . Transmission study may undertake direct skin feed and/or indirect membrane feeding mosquito . For indirect Membrane Feeding Assays ( MFA ) , blood collect participant membrane feed use Anopheles vector mosquito . For direct skin feeding assay ( DFA ) , participant escort PC3 quarantine insectary facility QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute ask allow Anopheles vector mosquito fee volar surface forearm , calf thighs period 15±5 minute . Microscopic examination confirmation gametocytaemia may conduct discretion Investigator . If gametocytaemia detect , Cohort 2 , second strength dose SJ733 may administer Day 23 , ass SJ733 reduce gametocyte subsequent infectivity mosquito . To receive second SJ733 dose , participant &gt; 500 parasites/ml ( determined 18S qPCR ) verify gametocyte PCR pfs25 and/or ring stage marker appropriate . Membrane feed direct skin feeding may occur and/or second SJ733 dose . Participants receive second SJ733 dose visit study unit morning Day 23 dosing allow leave ~10 hour . Participants blood sample take visit time-points indicate protocol . Compulsory commencement treatment Riamet® ( artemether-lumefantrine ) occur 16 day ( ±3 day ) post initial SJ733 treatment unless require earlier ( Cohort 1 Cohort 2 give second SJ733 dose ) . If second dose SJ733 give Cohort 2 , Riamet® treatment occur 11 day ( ± 3 day ) post second SJ733 treatment unless require earlier . Early intervention occur either poor response fast response see follow SJ733 treatment . This ensure participant safety avoid participant inconvenience useful data obtain . A poor response define decrease parasitaemia le 20 % baseline 3 day post SJ733 treatment . A fast response occur , within seven day period , two consecutive PCR assessment 48 hour negative . However , pre-emptive treatment Riamet® commence whenever deem necessary Investigator . Participants administer curative Riamet® site initial dosing follow monitoring , either clinic , telephone three day ensure adherence Riamet® therapy . Participants treat single dose ( 45 mg ) primaquine ( Primacin™ ) describe Section 4.3 protocol time Riamet® treatment gametocyte identify , ensure complete clearance gametocyte present . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , confinement within clinical research unit , outpatient review follow malaria challenge inoculation administration antimalarial treatment . Blood sample safety evaluation , include LFT assessment , malaria monitoring , pharmacokinetic determination drug level plasma and/or blood , red blood cell antibody draw screen and/or baseline nominate time malaria challenge . This study include evaluation optional , exploratory marker , require separate inform consent participant agree participate .</detailed_description>
