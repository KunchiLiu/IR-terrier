	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( complete response + partial response ) cabozantinib-s-malate ( XL184 ) child young adult . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define XL184 related toxicity pediatric , adolescent young adult patient . II . To define XL184 pharmacokinetics pediatric adolescent patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 1-year time progression , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival stratum , feasible compare historical control . II . To assess effect XL184 patient ' immune cell subset . III . To obtain tumor tissue ( snap frozen , formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [ FFPE ] block , unstained slide ) diagnosis , recurrence , , possible future study . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 month 1 year annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
