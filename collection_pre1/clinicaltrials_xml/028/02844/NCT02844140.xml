	<detailed_description>In order calculate dose distribution proton adequately , accurate estimation stop power ratio ( SPR ) medium water , require . Using conversion single energy CT ( SE-CT ) image result uncertainty SPR least 3-4 % . This uncertainty result use large margin around clinical target volume ( CTV ) hence dose organ risk ( OAR ) . It also effect conservative use beam direction , often sub-optimal , avoid irradiate normal tissue . Dual energy CT ( DE-CT ) improve accuracy SPR therefore proton range estimation . An evaluation proton range several tissue use SE-CT DE-CT input Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulation show average improvement range prediction 0.1 % 2.1 % use DECT instead SECT , several phantom also versus proton-CT , error SE-CT base proton stop power ratio report 7 % . A limitation study perform phantom . In first clinical data set five patient base skull tumour , report although SPR estimation indeed well DE-CT SE-CT , clinical relevance unclear . However , study , phantom measurement show large uncertainty SPR lung . This due large heterogeneity lung huge difference density lung compare mediastinum , tumour chest cavity . It therefore important study SPR differences SE-CT compare DE-CT lung cancer patient impact dose distribution especially context adaptive radiotherapy . As course concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy , standard treatment majority stage III lung cancer patient , important anatomical change may occur , also clinical relevance determine influence repeat dose calculation DE-CT .</detailed_description>
