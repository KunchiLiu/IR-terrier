	<brief_summary>Patients age ≥70 year acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) poor prognosis age 60 69 year . The poor outcome result treatment-related toxicity elderly patient , owe comorbidities , great possibility hematopoietic disorder , biologically poor risk prognosis . Anthracycline- cytarabine-based therapy , administer 3 7 day respectively ( 3 +7 ) , remain standard induction therapy patient population . This approach improve survival compare supportive care ( median , 5 vs. 3 month ) adult age ≥ 65 year . However , overall view result intensive chemotherapy elderly patient remain poor . Although complete remission ( CR ) rate 40 % 80 % achieve highly select population , long-term survival poor . Furthermore , clinical trial enrol patient adequate performance status ( PS ) . Prognostic model develop clinical trial data predict outcome old patient . However ; model rely chronologic age . Age surrogate measure change tumor biology patient characteristic . Understanding patient likely benefit intensive therapy versus low-intensity therapy supportive care critical . The definition `` fit '' undergo intensive induction therapy establish , therapeutic choice mainly determine physician patient decision . In old patient , low-dose cytarabine ( LD-AraC ) demonstrate beneficial best supportive care hydroxyurea . The recent availability new drug could improve side effect profile , case , bioavailability might offer future improvement patient population . In set , investigator tend consider , since 2007 , patient age ≥70 year potential candidate alternative low intensity therapy ( LD-AraC , hypomethylating agent ) even present good physical condition . The investigator goal determine whether age ≥ 70 year could represent useful simple cut treatment decision-making clinical practice whether low-intensity therapy could alternative therapeutic approach intensive chemotherapy even patient age ≥ 70 year theoretically `` fit '' ( WHO /ECOG/ PS ≤ 2 ) .</brief_summary>
