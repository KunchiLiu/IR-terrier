	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial involve total 24 subject . The investigator propose recruit subject 2 group : 1 ) Extraction treat xenograft bone substitute ( BioOss Collagen® ) + collagen dressing ( HeliPlug® ) , 2 ) Extraction treat xenograft bone substitute ( BioOss Collagen® ) + 3D-collagen matrix ( Mucograft Seal® ) . All subject recruit already approve treatment plan extraction + implant placement non-study personnel avoid potential conflict interest . All subject radiographs show tooth plan extraction . Each subject eligible 1 tooth extraction + dental implant rehabilitation . After tooth extraction , subject receive standard site preservation therapy consist xenograft bone substitute + collagen dress alternative site preservation therapy consist xenograft bone substitute + 3D-collagen matrix . After conventional 6-month healing period , subject receive dental implant previous extract site . During dental implant procedure , 2x5mm bone core biopsy + 2mm gingival biopsy obtain implant site . Biopsy sample store future histological histochemical analysis . After dental implant placement , subject receive heal abutment soft tissue heal prior implant restoration . During 6-month healing time tooth extraction site preservation therapy , subject return week-1 , week-2 , week-4 , month-3 , month-6 intra-oral scanning soft tissue volumetric acquirement . Subjects receive Cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) prior extraction baseline hard-tissue volume measurement appropriate extraction plan 6-month post-extraction volumetric measurement appropriate implant treatment planning . Hard tissue analysis perform compare linear ridge remodeling ( baseline vs. 6-month healing ) . CBCT image analyze non-contact reverse engineering system . Soft tissue volumetric analysis perform compare soft tissue heal BioOss Collagen + Mucograft Seal BioOss Collagen + Collagen Dressing . Images capture intra-oral scanner collect baseline , week-1 , -2 , -4 , month-3 , month-6 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must adult male female age 18 80 year ( inclusive ) . Subjects must able willing follow study procedure instruction English . Subjects must read , understood sign informed consent form English . Subjects must maxillary premolar , canine , lateral incisor , central incisor restorative periodontal hopeless prognosis ( Kwok Caton 2007 ) , implant indicate without sinus lift require . Subjects undergo implant placement adequate periodontal health prior implant placement . This include probe depth ≤ 4 mm remain teeth quadrant propose implant placement . Patients periodontal probe site probe depth 5 mm may also include bleed probe site absent . Each subject consider periodontally stable prior implant surgery . Individuals chronic disease oral manifestation . Individuals exhibit gross oral pathology . The use either antibiotic chronic use ( 7 day ) NSAIDs within 1 month prior screen examination . Individuals require antibiotic prophylaxis prior dental treatment . Chronic treatment ( i.e . two week ) medication know affect periodontal status ( e.g . phenytoin , calcium antagonist , cyclosporine , Coumadin ) within 1 month prior screen examination . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( HbA1c &gt; 7 ) within 3 month prior screen examination . Individual uncontrolled parafunctional habit , clench bruxing object , could adversely impact implant survival . Individuals history intravenous bisphosphonates . Individuals active infectious disease hepatitis , HIV tuberculosis . Current cigarette smoker . Individuals know pregnant , breastfeed plan become pregnant within 6 month . Individuals blood disorder ( hemophilia ) /or currently take anticoagulant medication , heparin , warfarin , clopidrogrel . Individuals receive therapy know affect healing , high dose corticosteroid , radiation therapy chemotherapy . Individuals allergic topical local anesthesia . Individuals require maxillary sinus augmentation prior dental implant therapy . Individuals dehisce , fenestrated , fracture labial/buccal alveolar bone plate determine baseline CBCT tooth extraction 50 % buccal bone height present . In case , surgeon determines guide bone regeneration ( bone graft membrane ) need repair defect , do cost subject , subject exclude study protocol .</criteria>
