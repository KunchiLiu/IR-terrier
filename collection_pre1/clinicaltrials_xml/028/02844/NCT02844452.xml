	<brief_summary>Introduction : Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) chronic relapse inflammatory skin disease induce poor quality life . Its conventional treatment often cause unsatisfactory relief adverse effect long-term application . Acupuncture treatment regard curative effect AD symptom . The aim trial evaluate therapeutic effect acupuncture AD symptom include pruritus poor quality life patient AD . Method Analysis : This trial randomize , sham-controlled pilot trial different visit frequency . 30 eligible patient atopic dermatitis randomly allocate ratio 1:1:1 Verum Acupuncture group 1 ( VA1 , 3 day weekly ) , Verum Acupuncture group 2 ( VA2 , 2 day weekly ) Sham Acupuncture group ( 2 day weekly ) . The acupuncture treatment give three two time week 4 week accord allocate group . The main outcome measure Visual analogue scale itch ( itch VAS ) , SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) Eczema Area Severity Index ( EASI ) evaluate improvement AD symptom Patient Oriented Eczema Measure ( POEM ) , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) ass quality life AD patient . It measure baseline , week treatment period follow-up period . Ethics/Dissemination : This protocol approve Institutional Review Boards Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital May 2016 .

	<detailed_description>Objectives This pilot study aim investigate feasibility validate anti-pruritic effectiveness sole acupuncture intervention efficacy different frequent treatment acupuncture , discover noble candidate specific biomaterial associate development atopic dermatitis . Moreover , result facilitate calculate sample size study . Trial design A randomized , sham-controlled , different intervention frequency trial conduct Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital June November 2016 . Participants Recruitment Recruitment Acquiring consent conduct investigator principle inform consent confirm participant ' voluntarism . The participant sign document make general consent form additional consent provision blood collection use human derive material first . The exemplary consent paper relate literature offer upon request . Randomization allocation concealment The AD patient randomize one three group via block randomization . An independent statistician product random number PROC PLAN SAS 9.2 ( SAS institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) transfer Acupuncture Meridian Science Research Center ( AMSRC ) Kyung Hee University randomization number seal sequentially numbered non-transparent envelope staff uninvolved study . At begin randomization process , investigator call independent staff AMSRC pas screen number participant . Then AMSRC staff immediately assign participate patient one three group unseal numbered envelope . It document trial master file thoroughly . Blinding The participate patient assessor blind group allocation patient trial . It impossible acupuncturists unaware group assignment , perform outcome measurement data analysis . To prevent possible bias , eye patch apply patient acupuncture treatment , unable see practice procedure . All acupuncture treatment , regardless group assignment , practice use Park sham device ( AcuPrime Co. , Ltd. , Exeter , UK ) attach applied acupoints block sight penetrate non-penetrating skin acupuncture needle 9 . The acupuncture needle device maintain 15 min identically . Intervention Acupuncture treatment Both manual acupuncture treatment acupressure would conduct every participate AD patient . It design become pragmatic treatment procedure correspond real clinic setting . In study , manual acupuncture treatment compose basic acupuncture treatment additional acupuncture treatment : partially individualized acupuncture treatment conduct basis traditional meridian theory consensus expert acupuncture atopic disease . The number applied acupoints per patient per session range 6 19 . The optional point include ST43 , GB41 , LI2 , TE3 , SI3 , TE6 , SI2 , BL66 , LR3 SP3 . The clinical research coordinator ask symptom associate additional acupuncture treatment reduce bias . The acupuncture treatment practice sterilized stainless needle ( 40 mm length 0.25 mm diameter ; Dongbang Acupuncture Inc. , Bundang , Sungnam , Korea ) one Korean Medicine Docter . Manipulation technique perform elicit 'de qi ' sensation . The needle inserted depth 5 30 mm retain 15 minute . Acupressure technique take elimination stainless needle . The 1.5 mm press tack needle ( Haeng Lim Seo Won Medical co. , China ) attach four acupoints per participate patient per session : LI11 bilaterally auricular-Shenmen contralaterally . It design traditional meridian theory consensus expert acupuncture atopic disease . The patient instruct involved staff press apply press tack needle locate LI11 feel severe pruritus 3 min . All acupuncture practice carry Korean Medicine Doctor , train 10 hour guarantee could perform identical acupuncture treatment accord pre-constructed protocol . Dropout criteria patient ' visit During study period , patient visit 12 8 treatment session accord allocate group . Since frequent visit would burden participate patient cause absences trial , make criterion absence participant group range dropout . Acupuncture group 1 , total 12 acupuncture treatment , ought complete 10 treatment session minimum acupuncture group 2 sham acupuncture group , total 8 acupuncture treatment , ought complete 6 session . Each treatment session allocate group delay 6 day previous session . Outcome measure One health care provider involve study conduct series outcome measure . There separation primary secondary outcome since exploratory pilot study search independent effectiveness acupuncture intervention atopic dermatitis secure dataset study . SCORAD index Itch VAS EASI score POEM DLQI CES-D STAXI Investigating biomaterials blood collection Serum total IgE measurement Serum cytokine/chemokines measurement Serum cortisol measurement MicroRNA microarray Statistical Methods Sample size calculation The current trial establish pilot study investigate anti-pruritic effect acupuncture patient atopic disease . A total 30 AD patient , 10 group , 20 healthy control recruit study period regard 20 % dropout rate . Its outcome suggest evidence feasibility large-scale study sample size calculation . Statistical analysis A statistician uninvolved research team take charge statistical analysis use SPSS 21.0 ( IBM SPSS Statistics , New York , USA ) . Categorical variable provide percentage continuous variable provide mean standard deviation . The intervention effectiveness analyze change baseline end treatment period follow-up period . Data analysis baseline characteristic allocate group compare repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) test χ2 test respectively continuous variable categorical variable . The different efficiency accord three time twice weekly acupuncture treatment analyze change itch VAS SCORAD index Mann-Whitney U-test continuous variable χ2 test categorical variable . The difference therapeutic efficiency verum acupuncture treatment group sham acupuncture treatment group investigate way . And outcome data analyze 0.1 ( two-sided ) statistical significance level 90 % confidence interval regard professional advice small sample size . For study , difference treatment group control group apply calculate number need participant set 0.05 α 80 % power . Protection human subject Ethical approval registration This study protocol approve Institutional Review Boards Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital ( KOMCIRB-160212-HRBR-004 ) . It perform accordance standard International Committee Harmonization Good Clinical Practice revise version Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
