	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent BCG-Unresponsive Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate complete response 25 week registration carcinoma situ ( CIS ) component evaluate event-free survival 18 month patient BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( Ta/T1/CIS ) treat atezolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate event-free survival 18 month subset patient papillary cancer ( Ta/T1 ) . II . To estimate progression-free survival , cystectomy-free survival , bladder cancer-specific survival , overall survival patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate level agreement local central pathology review term recurrence ( patient ) complete response ( CIS subset ) . II . To identify marker predict response atezolizumab CIS population associate event-free survival ( EFS ) patient Ta/T1/CIS BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . The following marker test : expression PD-L1 CD8 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; expression immune signatures RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course ( 51 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 2 year every 24 week 3 year .</detailed_description>
