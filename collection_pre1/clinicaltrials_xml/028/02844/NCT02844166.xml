	<brief_summary>The presence pressure injury consider quality indicator health care service effort make develop guideline prevent issue . Intensive care unit admission ( ICU ) recognize risk factor develop pressure injury due reduce mobility critically ill patient large number device hard technology jeopardize preventive measure , , decubitus change . There current definitive evidence superiority support surface treat prevent pressure injury . The objective present study analyze use viscoelastic support surface vulnerable critically ill patient decrease incidence pressure injury compare pyramidal foam support surface . Randomized clinical trial perform intensive care unit adult patient philanthropic hospital . Inclusion criteria patient admit ICU Braden scale ≤ 14 . Exclusion criterion age 18 year , less 24 hour ICU length stay , contraindication perform complete institutional preventive measure support injury , presence support injury ICU admission absence inform consent . Randomization make computerize generated number patient allocate two group ratio 1:1 . All study patient care accord standard institutional preventive measure . The interventional group place ICU bed viscoelastic support surface control group ICU bed pyramidal foam support surface . The main outcome evaluate occurrence type II pressure injury . Secondary outcome time occurrence pressure injury , length ICU hospital stay 28 day mortality rate . Significance level 5 % .</brief_summary>
