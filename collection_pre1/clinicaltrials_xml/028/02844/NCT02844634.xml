	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale : 1.1 Men sex men antecedent diagnosis another sexually transmit infection , particularly syphilis , high risk HIV infection . Men sex men ( MSM ) continue experience high rate HIV incident infection Canada disproportionately high burden disease relative general population . In 2011 , approximately 48 % new diagnosis occur MSM across Canada , figure relatively stable last decade . Within British Columbia ( BC ) , although HIV new diagnosis rate overall decline last decade ( drop rate 10.6 cases/100,000 2004 5.9 cases/100,000 2013 ) , MSM make increase majority new diagnosis ( 59 % ) within BC 2013 . Within Vancouver Coastal Health Authority ( VCH ) , approximately 70 % new HIV diagnose annually 2012-15 amongst MSM . Targeting prevention intervention MSM high risk important determine potential publicly fund biomedical intervention , particularly use HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) . Antecedent diagnosis another sexually transmit infection ( STI ) may serve entry point biomedical prevention individual high risk incident HIV . In evaluation HIV incidence follow diagnosis syphilis infection New York City , annual HIV incidence 3.6 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] : 3.27 % - 3.97 % ) , overall HIV incidence amongst MSM 5.56 % ( 1 ) . In male syphilis subsequent additional STI HIV incidence even great 7.89 % ( 95 % CI : 6.62 % - 9.24 % ) . A similar analysis client attend STI clinic BC reveal antecedent STI predictive elevate risk subsequent HIV seroconversion client ever diagnosis syphilis HIV incidence 3.6 % person-years ( 95 % CI : 2.5-4.9 ) , gonorrhea ( 2.0 % ; 95 % CI : 1.6-2.5 ) , rectal gonorrhea ( 4.5 % person-years ; 95 % CI : 3.4-5.8 ) , individual rectal gonorrhea syphilis incidence rate 12.6 % person-years ( 95 % CI : 8.4-21.8 ) . Evaluating use PrEP MSM antecedent STI important component inform HIV prevention program BC nationally . The STI clinic operate BC Centre Disease Control well-positioned evaluation 15 25 % HIV diagnose BC VCH , respectively diagnosed clinic . 1.2 . STI prevention strategy may also benefit biomedical prevention intervention Novel biomedical strategy show effective prevent acquisition STI HIV , consider standard care at-risk MSM United States . The use antiretroviral combination tenofovir/emtricitabine show associate overall 44 % reduction HIV acquisition high-risk MSM take daily PrEP . In individual detectable drug level , benefit high 90 % risk reduction . In real-world evaluation PrEP , high-risk sexual behaviour may continue evidenced high rate intercurrent STI ( 50 % PrEP users 12 month study 657 PrEP initiator San Francisco ) . As , biomedical intervention may offer additional reduction acquisition common sexually transmitted infection evaluate . Recently small pilot study demonstrate potential benefit similar strategy syphilis prevention ( 2 ) . In study 30 MSM randomize receive either 100mg doxycycline daily contingency management strategy link remain free sexually transmit disease progressive study visit . Doxycycline 100mg daily choose base prior study indicate dos low weekly doxycycyline could serve prophylaxis leptospirosis , another spirochete infection . Overall , receive doxycycline significantly less likely diagnosed STI follow-up comparator arm ( odds ratio [ OR ] 0.27 ; 95 % CI 0.09 - 0.83 ) . Specific protection syphilis infection see on-treatment phase ( OR 0.27 ; 95 % CI 0.04 - 1.73 ) , possibly reflect small sample size . During study period , change sexual behaviour arm note , support potential role doxycycline prophylaxis . A large pilot evaluation strategy , combination HIV PrEP , would novel syndemic approach address HIV syphilis burden amongst high risk MSM . The investigator therefore propose undertake randomize trial immediate vs. defer doxycycline conjunction daily tenofovir/emtricitabine determine feasibility combine HIV syphilis pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM recent history syphilis infection Vancouver , Canada . 2 . Objectives : 1 . To assess feasibility use dual daily PrEP . Defined : 1 . Proportion individual successfully complete 12 month tenofovir/emtricitabine 2 . Proportion individual successfully complete six 12 month doxycycline . 2 . To evaluate adherence tolerability daily dual PrEP at-risk MSM . 3 . To evaluate change sexual activity report study participant study period . 4 . To evaluate HIV incidence syphilis re-infection rate 12 month period stratify use doxycycline PrEP . 5 . To describe frequency STI 's diagnose study participant study period .</detailed_description>
