	<brief_summary>Sleepwalking ( also call somnambulism ) disorder SWS disrupt . This NREM parasomnia characterize inappropriate motor behavior , usually initiate arousal SWS , induce psychological distress alter quality life , lead fatigue , excessive daytime sleepiness , objectively impaired vigilance morning . The pathophysiology sleepwalk remains poorly understood . Sleepwalkers difficulty maintain stable , consolidated sleep experience arousal microarousals , specifically SWS , lead increase NREM instability , especially first sleep cycle . The brain partially awake , result behavioral manifestation , partially NREM sleep , result conscious awareness action . A Single Photonic Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) study one sleepwalking episode find increase activation posterior cingulate cortex cerebellum , deactivation frontoparietal associative cortex . Data intracerebral EEGs confusional arousal confirm local arousal motor cingulate cortex increase delta activity frontoparietal associative cortex . The investigator thus propose control study SPECT imagery 24 sleepwalker ( 12 SPECT SW episode 12 SPECT slow wave sleep 24 wakefulness ) 12 control ( slow wave sleep wakefulness ) . SW episodes elicited sleep deprivation condition associate force arousal ( auditory stimulus ) . The comparative analysis SPECT acquisition different state ( wakefulness , slow wave sleep SW ) population ( sleepwalker versus control ) provide new insight complex pathophysiology SW episode .</brief_summary>
