	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) haematological malignant disease characterize uncontrolled proliferation immature hematopoietic cell . Over last two decade , clinical trial demonstrate improved response rate young adult AML . Aggressive induction plus potent intensification program chemotherapy alone chemotherapy plus stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) improve treatment result . Advances understanding disease biology , improvement induction consolidation program , well supportive care also contribute . A number clinical laboratory characteristic influence response treatment , thus , survival patient AML . Among , cytogenetic diagnosis represent important prognostic variable . However , factor may prognostic value may influence patient 's outcome . Anaemia thrombocytopenia cardinal manifestation AML . Over last decade , become apparent frequency allogeneic blood transfusion modify host immunity clinical outcome . Anaemia long recognize adverse prognostic factor myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , represent pre-leukemic disease . Red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion need identify strong independent risk factor survival MDS , presence severity anaemia attribute clonally advance biologically aggressive disease . Based data , investigator retrospectively assess prognostic value RBC platelet transfusion time diagnosis frequency transfusion first induction course chemotherapy large unselected group patient previously untreated AML .</brief_summary>
