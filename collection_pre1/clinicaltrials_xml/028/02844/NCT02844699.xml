	<detailed_description>Mobilan nanoparticle-formulated , recombinant non-replicating adenovirus immunotherapeutic drug directs expression toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) specific agonistic ligand , entolimod ( recombinant form natural TLR5 ligand , flagellin ) . The viral construct infects cell express Coxsackie virus adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) , show preclinical study highly express human prostatic tissue , include prostate cancer tissue . Upon infection , co-expression receptor ligand transfected cell trigger persistent autocrine stimulation nuclear factor‑kappa B ( NF‑κB ) signal cascade . In syngeneic mouse prostate cancer model , prostatic injection Mobilan lead activation innate immune response infiltration neutrophils natural killer cell ( NK ) cell induction adaptive immune response , comprise cytotoxic ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 8+ ) T cell . Necrotic change tumor cell observe Mobilan-treated animal concomitant reduction prostatic volume . Mobilan also show anti-metastatic activity surgical adjuvant mouse model prostate cancer . This clinical trial Phase Ib double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy , safety , pharmacology either 1 2 injection Mobilan placebo administer neoadjuvant therapy directly prostates patient newly diagnose prostate cancer . All study subject receive 2 study drug injection administer 2 week apart randomly allocate 1:1:1 ratio 1 follow 3 drug administration schedule : - Arm A : Mobilan Day 1 Day 15 . - Arm B : Placebo Day 1 Mobilan Day 15 . - Arm C : Placebo Day 1 Day 15 Subjects subsequently undergo planned prostatectomy , ideally within 2 week follow final study drug injection remain observation thereafter .</detailed_description>
