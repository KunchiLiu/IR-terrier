	<brief_summary>The primary objective study establish feasibility value physical fitness assessment within patient receive cytotoxic chemotherapy . If successful , project establish groundwork physical function assessment large cancer clinical trial assist patient selection evaluation toxicity and/or response among trial participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Patients ' Performance Status Assessed Using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Wearable Data Generation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical fitness , whether measure performance capacity daily activity , predict risk toxicity help evaluate toxicity course cancer chemotherapy . Cytotoxic chemotherapy cause premature age frailty many cancer patient , measure improve physical function may also limit late morbidity mortality . Clinician-rated performance status ( cPS ; e.g. , ECOG Karnofsky PS ) without concomitant organ function test usual gold standard risk prognostication patient selection cancer setting , cPS subjective , unreliable , relatively sensitive patient significant functional compromise . Objective evaluation physical function potential augment even replace cPS cancer treatment set .</detailed_description>
