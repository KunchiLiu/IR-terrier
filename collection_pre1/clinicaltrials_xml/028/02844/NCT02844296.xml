	<detailed_description>1 . Scientific / historical background Smoking highly addictive quit difficult . Relapse common withdrawal symptom crave , headache , mood change irritation . In addition pharmacotherapy , exercise acutely reduce crave , withdrawal symptom negative affect regular smoker . Exercise effectively reduce negative affect attentional bias towards smoking , hence might relieve crave . A recent systematic review RCTs use exercise smoking cessation suggest trial large sample size , equal contact control condition measure exercise adherence need confirm effectiveness . Despite effectiveness various exercise intervention smoke cessation , previous RCTs require participant attend multiple guide exercise session least per week consecutively 6 12 week . Participants willing join session would high motivation quit , might over-estimate effect size limit applicability . These exercise session show high compliance effectiveness , could recruit participant show strong motivation quit much time attend . These intervention unlikely directly applicable smoker Hong Kong , mostly prefer `` self-determination '' use intensive smoking cessation service method quit attempt . Instead long duration ( 30+ minute ) exercise , short-bout exercise easily adhere daily living achieves similar health gain long-bout exercise . Some laboratory study show short-bout ( 5-10 minute ) isometric exercise ( e.g . jaw clench fist clench ) moderate intensity exercise ( e.g . stationary cycling ) effective reduce crave withdrawal symptom . No publish randomized control trial ( RCT ) short-bout exercise smoking cessation relapse prevention PubMed Cochrane Library find investigator . Handgrip , enhance train hand-griping strength , common short-bout exercise tool use lower blood arterial pressure . The advantage handgrip exercise ( HGE ) : ( 1 ) The equipment simple use inexpensive ; ( 2 ) It perform anytime anywhere ; ( 3 ) No intensive training need ; ( 4 ) Effects HGE immediate relieve craving ; ( 5 ) Adherence HGE shall high simple use . Grip strength adopt fitness test recruitment Hong Kong Police Force , show good predictor cardiovascular fitness survival . Therefore , exercise tool might also raise smoker ' interest initiate simple effective exercise quit attempt . Recently research team conduct pilot study deliver short-bout exercise ( 10 minute ) intervention session use handgrip client ( n=31 ) Integrated Centre Smoking Cessation Tung Wah Group Hospitals evaluate perceive effectiveness exercise . In 31 client , 18 ( 59.1 % ) smoking urge past 24 hour . Examples exercise isometric griping handgrip long possible rapid grip-and-release movement . While 2 client agree exercise increase abstinence guided exercise session , 12 post-session client ( 38.7 % ) agree . The participant perceive exercise beneficial smoking cessation , exercise conveniently perform urge alleviation distraction . On hand , result suggest several improvement delivery intervention increase exercise counsel user low perceive efficacy use handgrips high strength value . Applicability increase incorporate short-bout exercise , hand push pulling , handgrip available usage . Frequency use increase grip strength document indicator exercise compliance , additional benefit may increase smoker ' motivation . Short-bout exercise simple low-cost behavior need brief train non-healthcare professional take little time practice . The effect size may small moderate , large impact disseminate easily large number smoker . A short-bout exercise intervention propose , handgrip mainly plus without , ( 1 ) reduce crave first month cessation treatment ( 2 ) increase abstinence assess 6-month . The main barrier adopt small easy behavior inertia forgetfulness . To increase exercise adherence , Anti-inertia Reminder ( AIR ) model develop several strategy assist participant overcome inertia forgetfulness . 2 . Study design The study consist 3 phrase : ( 1a ) Development educational video exercise intervention ; ( 1b ) Development smartphone application ( `` App '' ) reminders electronic daily dairy ; ( 2 ) Briefing session ICSC counselor introduce brief short-bout exercise intervention RCT client ; ( 3 ) A randomize control trial test efficacy deliver brief short-bout exercise intervention smoke cessation . 2.1 Phase 1a - Development educational video exercise intervention 2.1.1 Objective A short video produce ( 5 minute ) part exercise intervention intervention group . It play tablet subject intervention group give consent participate recruitment . The video also available smartphone application he/she watch anytime . 2.1.2 Content The video ( 1 ) briefly deliver knowledge withdrawal symptom abstinence benefit short-bout exercise smoking cessation ; ( 2 ) guide participant practice short-bout exercise , include without handgrip ; ( 3 ) demonstrate scenario subject exercise work leisure time . The handgrip main exercise , subject carry along day . Exercises without handgrip demonstrate handgrip nearby ; ( 4 ) advise short-bout exercise much , crave . 2.2 Phase 1b - Development smartphone application 2.2.1 Objective A smartphone application ( `` App '' ) develop automatically send reminder handgrip exercise ( healthy diet ) enter data electronic daily diary . All subject ask receive reminder enter data App 4 week . Subjects ' identification number ( last 5 digit telephone number ) enter App instal mobile phone use first time . 2.2.2 Reminder system Subjects set personalize regular reminder schedule exercise diet App . These reminder short text message sound , picture vibration motivate user short-bout handgrip exercise adopt healthy diet . Subjects intervention ( exercise ) group ask respond reminder either select exercise moment later . Once select exercise , timer show timing exercise duration . All responses reminder exercise time record uploaded server immediately proxy measurement exercise adherence . The application generate report show much handgrip exercise do day subject far . The sever App detect subject respond reminder , , respond week , notify researcher encourage try . Subjects control ( healthy diet ) group , repair respond reminder , reminder time data document . Subjects also initiate exercise timer record exercise anytime anywhere . All action time uploaded server . 2.2.3 Data entry crave smoke All subject intervention/control group record smoking/quitting data via App . The App `` pop-up '' survey 4 question day accord participant 's setting : ( 1 ) How many craving today ? The 4 option none , 1-2 time , 3-9 time , every hour . ( 2 ) How crave past 24 hour ? The 5 option none , mild , fair , strong strong . ( 3 ) How many cigarette smoke today ? ( 4 ) Have use NRT product varenicline today ? The exact time short survey set subject . All response send server store dataset immediately . 2.2.4 Other educational material The App also contain intervention video relevant smoking cessation material . 2.3 Phase 2 - Briefing session ICSC counselor recruit subject RCT 2.3.1 Objectives The briefing session aim empower ICSC service provider ( 1 ) measure handgrip strength encourage smoker exercise , ( 2 ) introduce brief intervention motivating client practice short-bout exercise without handgrip , top usual counselling . 2.3.2 Target service provider All ICSC physician , nurse , social worker healthcare professional . 2.3.3 Briefing content The two-hour briefing include : 1 . Simple motivation empowerment smoker start adhere exercise 2 . Expected question smoker suggest answer 3 . Briefing operation randomize control trial 2.4 Phase 3 - Pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) 2.4.1 Study design objective The single-blinded , 2-arm RCT aim examine efficacy short-bout exercise intervention reduce crave increase tobacco abstinence . 2.4.2 Target subject All ICSC client enrol smoke cessation service screen counselor follow eligibility criterion : Inclusion criterion : - Newly- re-enrolled smoking cessation service ICSC ( mean exist client eligible , unless finish previous treatment re-enrolled ) - Consume 10 cigarette initially receive service ICSC - Aged 18 year - Able communicate Cantonese read Chinese - Have smart mobile phone ( IOS Android System ) mobile internet access - Show interest participate exercise program/healthy diet smoke cessation Exclusion criterion : - Incapable short-bout exercise due physical psychological condition - Pregnant 2.4.3 Recruitment procedure In 1st face-to-face session cessation treatment , usual ICSC counselor check eligibility client participation RCT . The counselor briefly introduce RCT use short-bout exercise ( treatment condition intervention group ) healthy diet ( treatment condition control group ) smoking cessation , include follow-up schedule , incentives follow-up . If interested , ask sign consent form participation . After consent form , counselor invite measure grip strength dynamometer accord standardize protocol show handgrip . Three measurement make hand participant . The maximum value obtain hand use analysis . Then , baseline information relate socio-demographics , smoke quit history collect counselor ( information may collect standard baseline questionnaire ICSC ) . The counselor randomize subject one RCT group open sequentially number , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE method ) , follow intervention delivery . After enrolment session , counselor immediately transfer contact detail participant scan/send document ( i. questionnaire ; ii . Consent form ; iii . Video feedback form via WhatsApp /Email ) HKU research staff follow-up . All baseline questionnaires consent form transfer HKU School Public Health every 2 week . 2.4.4 Intervention Intervention group After completion baseline questionnaire , subject intervention group give free handgrip ( strength 15 kg ) . Then , counselor play short video participant . The intervention group introduce one handgrip exercise reduce crave video : - Rapid grip-and-release handgrip least 30 time 10-15 second hand , - And short-bout exercise without handgrip also include : Hand push pulling . They encourage exercise crave , urge smoking expect . They also encourage increase frequency intensity exercise increase intensity reduce crave much possible , increase grip strength . After video , counselor assist subject install App mobile phone , set 4-week reminder schedule electronic daily diary , fill video feedback form . A leaflet exercise instruction motivation message base Health Action Process Approach ( HAPA ) give participant . Participants may practice exercise learn recently due inertia , even interested . To break inertia , Anti-inertia Reminder ( AIR ) develop several approach design intervention ( 1 ) aim motivate participant quickly whenever craving , every hour least even without crave . ( 2 ) The participant request make sure handgrip always see accessible crave relieve `` alarm '' . The subject suggest carry handgrip day place eye-catching place desk dinner table . ( 3 ) Participants require use smartphone application activate alarm set 4 week baseline intervention . The participant could set convenient time finish daily questionnaire . All exercise reminder design base refine taxonomy behavioral change technique physical activity order enhance strength future scientific reporting intervention . Control group The control group view 6-minute video healthy diet . After video , counselor also install another smartphone application healthy diet subject 's mobile phone set healthy die reminder schedule 4 week . They give leaflet healthy diet , 20-30 reminder healthy diet quit tip via App 4 week . Apart intervention , participant receive usual cessation treatment ICSC . 2.4.5 Outcomes The primary outcome 4-week self-reported smoking record 4 week . The secondary outcome biochemically validate abstinence self-reported abstinence past 7 day 6-month follow . Biochemical validate abstinence assess Smokerlyzer , exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) 4ppm define validated quitter . HK $ 50 offer client cover travel expense time cost . The subject contact via telephone 2-,6- 12-month conduct assessment follow outcome : self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence , Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale ( MNWS ) , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) , perceive effectiveness handgrip relieve crave ( 5-point Likert scale ) questionnaire surgery drink weekly intake . The 12-item Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire ( SEQ-12 ) add 12-month follow-up questionnaire . Grip strength within first two month enrollment measure . Follow-ups measure ICSC counselor HKU staff . Craving frequency , intensity exercise adherence include frequency duration enter App subject . The mean number day report smoke crave 4 week enrolment , assess 2 question daily basis : ( 1 ) presence craving ( 2 ) presence smoking . At enrolment , participant introduce enter information App daily basis first 4 week participation . The 2-,6- 12-month follow-up conduct visit ICSC telephone , HKU research staff blind group allocation . Incentive HK $ 50 provide participation follow-up . 2.4.6 Research hypothesis The intervention group significantly great decline crave frequency intensity , high 4-week self-reported quit rate 6-month follow-up control group , less mean number day report relapse . 2.4.7 Effect size estimation As pilot RCT examine effect size exercise intervention smoking cessation , total 200 ( group 100 ) subject target . Assuming 6-month quit rate intervention control group 60 % 50 % ( base previous data , odds ratio = 1.5 ) , power significant z-test 30 % . The power 70 % sample size 600 . 2.4.8 Randomization , allocation concealment blind Simple individual randomization method sequentially number , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) use ensure counselor participant blind allocation sequence group allocation . The primary investigator prepare 384 identical , opaque , seal , A5-sized envelop , unique 2-digit number centre name cover envelope identifier . Then create random sequence list intervention control group , group allocation sequentially number match envelope identifier . A paper indicate treatment condition insert envelop , accord random sequence list . The envelope distribute 8 ICSC ( 48 envelope ICSC ) . The ICSC counselor must open envelope follow sequence number envelope randomization procedure . The primary investigator HKU research staff involve randomization subject . Both counselor subject blind behavioral intervention , outcome assessor ( HKU research staff ) 2- 6-month follow-up blind group assignment . 2.4.9 Drop-out Subjects choose drop RCT study period , without penalty administrative procedure . If subject refuse continue intervention enrolment baseline intervention , reason drop-out document counselor report HKU research staff day . The envelope drop-out participant re-used participant . 2.4.10 Statistical analysis Data enter SPSS Windows ( version 20 ) analysis . By intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis bad case scenario , participant lose follow-up refuse follow-up treated smoker . Chi-square test use compare categorical variable subgroup . Complete case analysis do sensitivity analysis . Descriptive statistic include frequency , percentage , mean use summarize outcome variable . For quit outcome assess 2- 6-month follow-up , logistic regression linear regression use examine predictor . The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test use determine use test ( normal distribution ) Mann-Whitney U test ( non-normal distribution ) comparison continuous variable . General linear model repeat measure analysis ( ANOVA ) use examine change psychosocial variable grip strength . To compare number day report relapse crave first 4 week ( assessed via app ) 2 group , independent sample t-test use . For daily outcome include crave frequency , crave intensity cigarette consumption ( assessed via app ) , linear mixed model allow multiple observation subject account cluster data within subject use . Both main effect ( group ; exercise , intervention group ) interaction effect ( group X day ; exercise X day , intervention group ) analyze . 3 . Consent Participation study voluntary . The ICSC staff clinic explain potential subject agree join RCT carry RCT smoke cessation . The smoking cessation counselor explain subject receive telephone follow-ups 2 month , 6 month 12 month enquire smoke status . The subject assure withdraw study anytime without prejudice , information keep confidential result report aggregate format . Subjects require sign write consent form . 4 . Ethics Ethics approval seek Institutional Review Board University Hong Kong / Hong Kong Authority Hong Kong West Cluster . 5 .
