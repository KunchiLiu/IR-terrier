	<detailed_description>Regular physical exercise appear potentiate effect pharmacological treatment arterial hypertension . As , regular exercise recommend adjuvant treatment hypertensive subject European American guideline . Crucially , however , precise recommendation type physical exercise institute . Aerobic Interval Training ( AIT ) new novel type training appear beneficial patient suffer various medical condition . There distinct lack evidence affect arterial hypertension . The aim study evaluate influence 5 month period regular AIT blood pressure , carotid femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) applanation tonometry index patient previously treat pharmacologically mild moderate arterial hypertension . The study group consist 60 hypertensive subject ( 30 male , 30 female ) ( age 54.45 ± 8.52 year ) previously undergone least 2 year combine anti-hypertensive therapy well control hypertension , i.e . 140/90 mmHg . Their pharmacological treatment change study period . The study group randomly divide 2 subgroup . In first group ( G1 ) , AIT undertake 5 month ( 40 professional AIT session perform two time per week 50 minute session ) follow specially developed program . The second control group ( G2 ) , attend training session receive medical advice maintain physical activity outline JNC ( Joint National Committee ) hypertension guideline . During baseline visit five month ( final visit ) , group undergo test office BP ( blood pressure ) , PWV applanation tonometry index use SphygmoCor® device Complior® device .</detailed_description>
