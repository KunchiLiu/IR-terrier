	<detailed_description>This prospective open-label clinical study 50 patient determine safety treatment potential autologous cell therapy pain inflammation associate Osteoarthritis knee . Follow-up consist large sample include 4,000 patient . Patients treat Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee due degeneration chronic injury . They treat autologous Stromed obtain Adipose Ultrasonic Cell Recovery Unit ( AUCRU ) Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) process RegenLab ( RegenKit BCT-3 ) PRP product direct injection affect joint . Cohort 1 include PRP treatment time initial StroMed treatment plus 1 week , 2 week 1 month . Cohort 2 include PRP treatment time initial StroMed treatment plus 1 month 2 month . Patient outcomes track follow MRI various endpoint 6 month , laboratory test inflammation marker , knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score ( KOOS ) questionnaires . SF-36 form ( quality life measure ) numerical rating scale ( NRS ) also use assess safety efficacy treatment , well reduction patient medication and/or delay pending knee replacement therapy .</detailed_description>
