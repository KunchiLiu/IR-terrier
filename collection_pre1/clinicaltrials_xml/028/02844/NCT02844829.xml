	<brief_summary>This study enroll 200 men clinical suspicion prostate cancer due high serum level PSA 2.5 ng/ml abnormal digital rectal examination . Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) 3 Tesla ( T ) magnetic field use surface coil use non-invasively predict presence absence prostate cancer . Targeted TRUS guide biopsy base MRI finding perform addition routine twelve core TRUS biopsy . Moreover , select serum urine biomarkers well biomarkers extract fresh biopsy sample collect correlated presence absence prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
