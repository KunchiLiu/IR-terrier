	<brief_summary>Memory action especially important everyday life although current literature abundant . The enactment effect ( i.e . good memory perform action verbally encode sentence ) usually describe robust effect age find many disease . Although enactment effect study three decade , still consensus enhance memory . Therefore , order gain additional insight representational basis enactment effect , present study , investigator propose test neurological patient . The investigator suggest memory action well memory verbally encode information Alzheimer 's disease Parkinson 's disease . If patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) cognitive assessment last 6 month , realize different test : MMSE ( 1 ) , HAD ( 2 ) , cognitive assessment ( 3 ) ; ( 4 ) ; BREF ( 5 ) ; Assessment apraxia , ( 6 ) . Controls perform test verify cognitive impairment . Then , two experimental condition present patient control : first participant name drawing ( verbal learning ) second reproduce action associate drawing ( action learn ) . Immediately learn phase , recognition task available therefore participant recognize drawing present previously . The main criterion use statistical analysis correct recognition score .</brief_summary>
