	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine interaction GLP-1 GIP regulate insulin secretion nondiabetic subject . The first part aim determine threshold plasma concentration GLP-1 increase insulin secretion test hypothesis fasting level circulate GLP-1 insufficient mediate β-cell secretion . The second part aim determine whether insulin response specific amino acid dependent α-cell release GLP-1 . The study enroll 40 healthy overweight participant anticipate screen blood draw yield number screen failure , estimate 12 subject complete entire study protocol . Enrolled participant ask complete five study visit include consent visit four infusion study visit include hyperglycemic clamp . Each infusion procedure last 4 hour . The primary outcome visit 2-3 insulin secretion response hyperglycemia GLP-1 . Data analyze use 2-way ANOVA repeat measure use time treatment two factor . Post-hoc comparison use determine stage intact GLP-1 level exceed fasting level stage insulin secretion exceeds clamp alone . The primary outcome visit 4-5 arginine-stimulated insulin secretion without GLP-1r blockade . The mean increment ISR baseline 15 minute arginine stimulation use integrate insulin secretion , primary outcome measure , two-way analysis variance fasting/hyperglycemia , Ex-9/saline two factor ; post-hoc comparison among 4 insulin response make significant interaction present .</brief_summary>
