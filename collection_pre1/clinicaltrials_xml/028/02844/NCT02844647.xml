	<brief_summary>A pilot study group 10 men CRPC embark 6-month course treatment radium 223 . Study participant undergo anatomical MR imaging combine new hyperpolarized MRI ( 1 hour exam ) prior treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Carbon-13 Imaging Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>`` Hyperpolarization '' low natural abundance specie 13C , offer potential extract metabolic information real-time image biochemical reaction within body . In project , investigator focus prostate cancer , specifically late-stage disease , management patient would benefit new image method enables improve therapy selection , plan monitoring . For image lactate distribution bone-metastatic prostate cancer , 3D coverage large field-of-view require order cover vertebral column ( common site metastasis ) . To enable , investigator develop method use large-volume transmitter multi-channel receiver system 3-dimensional 13C metabolic image patient . The image resolution encode matrix tailor require 3D coverage vertebral column . At end study , investigator methodology , hardware clinical-research workflow need evaluate 13C-lactate image new tool help patient metastatic prostate cancer . The investigator would first world apply 13C metabolic MRI bone metastasis . Although investigator propose study patient start 6-month course treatment radium 223 , project , proof-of-concept study may also lead large clinical trial different point treatment pathway , prior decide treatment cytotoxic agent versus drug target androgen axis abiraterone .</detailed_description>
