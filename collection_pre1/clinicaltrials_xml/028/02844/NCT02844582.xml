	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel Prednisone Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether men poor initial response androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) good front line therapeutic response cabazitaxel compare historical control frontline metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) therapy abiraterone enzalutamide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 response rate , progression free survival ( PFS ) Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criterion , overall survival ( OS ) . II . To evaluate safety toxicity profile cabazitaxel patient CRPC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect serum tumor tissue sample molecular marker signature predictive cabazitaxel benefit ( include status androgen receptor [ AR ] pathway , androgen biosynthetic pathway gene , adenosine triphosphate [ ATP ] -binding cassette sub-family B member 1 [ ABCBI ] , multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 [ MRP1 ] , mediator taxane resistance ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
