	<detailed_description>Investigators conduct previous retrospective study evaluate possible finding ultrasound may better predict reflux . Investigators find postnatal ultrasound show three finding hydroureter , duplication dysmorphic kidney , odds ratio detect reflux 8.07 ( 95 % CI 3.86 , 16.87 ) . The purpose study perform randomize prospective study validate retrospective study . Investigators hypothesis patient hydronephrosis alone likely negative VCUG study ; hence obtain VCUG indication may warrant .</detailed_description>
