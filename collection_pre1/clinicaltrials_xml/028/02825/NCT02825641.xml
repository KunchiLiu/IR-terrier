	<brief_title>Premature Rupture Membranes With Bishop Score &lt; 6 : Comparison Medical Induction/Expectant Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In set premature rupture membrane term pregnancy , customary woman active labor wait 24 hour attempt induce labor . The mean labor induction use medical center either intravenous oxytocin per-vaginal dinoprostone , depend patient ` obstetric history cervical condition . The investigator hypothesize commence induction labor presentation woman either mean induction lead high rate vaginal delivery , short interval time onset rupture membrane time delivery low rate cesarean section . The participant study , upon sign informed consent , randomize 4 groups-2 group expectant management labor induction commence 24 hour either oxytocin dinoprostone 2 group active management labor induction commence presentation either oxytocin dinoprostone . The participant follow time presentation rupture membrane delivery room time delivery . Further obstetric , clinical demographic information acquire patient ` electronic medical file analysis accuracy sub-analysis .</detailed_description>
