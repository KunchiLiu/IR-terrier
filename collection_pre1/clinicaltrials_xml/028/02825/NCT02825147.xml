	<detailed_description>Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma kind tumor prevalent Asia South America Western world , almost invariably EBV- associate often present localized disease around nasal structure . The disease frequency high Asian country difference age , gender immunophenotypic profile nasal extranasal case . EBV constant finding , particularly case present localize nasal disease assume involved pathogenesis . During past decade disease , historically term `` lethal midline granuloma '' aggressive poor survival . Five-year OS extra-nasal disease report 9 % compare 42 % localized disease . Although radiotherapy combine without anthracycline-based chemotherapy consider treatment extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma past , numerous data suggest tumor chemosensitive due p-glycoprotein expression , may mediate drug resistance . CHOP/CHOP-like schedule present low CR rate frequent failure chemotherapy . Disseminated involvement much poor prognosis localize disease latter benefit radiotherapy . In near ten year , many new agent use treatment extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma , promise one asparaginase . Asparaginase-containing regiment demonstrate 50 % response rate 5-year overall survival 65 % relapsed refractory disease . The impressive outcome indicate value newly diagnose patient , especially disseminated case . Pegaspargase new form asparaginase display equivalent bioactivity L- asparaginase longer half-time low incidence allergy . Its clinical efficacy verify patient acute lymphocytic leukemia . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety pegaspargase methotrexate base regimen without radiotherapy newly diagnose patient extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma , include localize disseminated case .</detailed_description>
