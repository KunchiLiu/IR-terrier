	<brief_summary>Non cardiac chest pain ( NCCP ) define recur , angina-like , retrosternal chest pain non cardiac origin . Annual prevalence NCCP general population western world range 25-35 % . Of patient present emergency room chest pain , cardiac etiology ultimately find 11-39 % . Several condition associate NCCP , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) prevalent , constitute 60 % case . However , NCCP consider disorder heterogenous nature several condition , apart GERD , esophageal dysmotility esophageal hypersensitivity implicate . Treatment NCCP remain real challenge due diverse underlie mechanism responsible patient ' symptom . Given fact GERD far common etiology , proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy try extensively ; however , 6 week treatment complete resolution symptom occur 30 % patient , optimal duration PPI administration know , best maintenance dose never determine . Although administration selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) could theoretically benefit patient esophageal hypersensitivity , trial publish far include small number patient report conflicting result , co-administration PPIs SSRIs evaluate far . Furthermore , data treatment patient functional chest pain lacking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We therefore design prospective study order evaluate effect PPI SSRI therapy different subtypes NCCP patient use multichannel intraluminal impedance pH ( MII-pH ) monitoring . METHODS Patients non cardiac chest pain symptom present participate centre , prospectively screen entry study . They undergo comprehensive diagnostic evaluation cardiologist order exclude cardiac source chest pain . Patients recruit study either normal coronary angiogram lack ischemic heart disease exercise treadmill stress thallium test Inclusion criterion ) patient least 3 episode chest pain per week previous 3 month . The exclusion criterion : ) thoracic , esophageal gastric surgery ii ) primary secondary esophageal motility disorder iii ) use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin iv ) presence Barrett 's esophagus , erosive esophagitis , peptic stricture duodenal gastric ulcer upper endoscopy v ) eosinophilic esophagitis vi ) underlie psychiatric illness vii ) pregnancy woman viii ) refusal participate . Study protocol All subject agree participate study undergo upper endoscopy ass presence absence esophageal mucosal injury . Patients Barrett 's esophagus erosive esophagitis include present study . Furthermore , biopsies take patient eosinophilic esophagitis also exclude . All patient also subject stationary esophageal manometry motility abnormality exclude . During esophageal manometry lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) locate . Esophageal impedance-pH monitoring perform participate subject use ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance ( MII ) pH monitor system ( Sleuth ; Sandhill Scientific , Inc. Higland Ranch , CO , USA ) . During test , subject eat three standard meal , begin end time every meal indicate diary . Subjects also instruct press event marker button data logger whenever experience chest pain . Data recording conclude 24 hour , patient return endoscopy unit catheter removal . The impedance pH data use determine patient number type reflux episode total 24-hour esophageal acid exposure , define total time pH 4 divided time monitoring . Total distal esophageal acid exposure ( i.e. , % time pH &lt; 4 ) less 4.2 % 24 hour consider normal . In patient calculate symptom index ( SI ) chest pain . Bioview analysis software use calculation SI . According set software symptom consider related reflux occur within 2-min time window onset reflux episode . SI define number symptom associate reflux divide total number symptom . A positive SI declare â‰¥ 50 % ( i.e , least half symptom associate reflux ) . Treatment Patients abnormal distal acid esophageal exposure receive PPI twice daily 8 week . Patients positive symptom index chest pain receive citalopram 20 mg daily PPI daily 8 week . Patients negative symptom index chest pain receive citalopram 20mg daily 8 week . All patient evaluate end 8-week period ask presence absence chest pain . Treatment success define complete disappearance chest pain , presence mild infrequent symptom consider treatment failure .</detailed_description>
