	<brief_summary>Prolonged sit risk factor cardiovascular musculoskeletal disease , diabetes , several type cancer all-cause mortality . In combination static awkward posture , prevalence musculoskeletal diseases increase . Although implementation sit-to-stand active workstation help reduce sit time , improve physical activity work promote health benefit , might also lead change cognitive function productivity The purpose study evaluate mid-term effect novel two desk sit-to-stand workplace sit time well physiological cognitive parameter healthy people work age comparison traditional workplace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mid-term Effect Novel Sit-to-stand Workplace ( ACTIVE OFFICE ) Cognitive Physiological Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurements make field laboratory . Field measurement make process continuously 23-week intervention period . Laboratory measurement make two different day , one day prior intervention , one day follow intervention ( due cross-over design , subject underwent 4 total day laboratory measurement ) . Field measurement collect automatically participant ' workstation work office . Laboratory test conduct control , simulate work-space locate University Applied Sciences Campus Linz . All laboratory measurement make control laboratory campus site Linz University Applied Sciences Upper Austria . Temperature , air flow , humidity , light condition ( artificial light ) noise level control set consistent subject ' typical work environment . During laboratory measurement , subject either stand sat upright ergonomic office chair , accord study protocol . Subjects encourage work fast accurately could . To ensure identical test condition subject unduly influence physiological parameter salivary cortisol level heart rate variability , subject require minimize excessive movement ( e.g . stand sit period ) . In first ( initial ) phase , participant familiarize study protocol . Sitting time weekly physical activity determine via IPAQ-questionnaire . Examples cognitive test implement cognitive phase execute accord guideline . A 30 minute break sit posture use ascertain baseline heart-rate cortisol level . Baseline heart-rate calculate 20 minute rest 5 minute interval saliva sample collect end ( 30min ) break . In second ( cognitive ) phase subject participate test battery contain five block . Each block consist work speed test ( text edit task ) , attentional test ( d2R-test attention ) reaction time test ( Stroop-test ) . These test last 30 minute fulfill recommendation regard postural change . To simulate `` common '' work condition ( computer base non-computer base task ) , digital ( text editing task , Stroop-test ) well pen &amp; paper ( d2R-test ) version implement test use . All block execute alternate posture ( sit - stand - sit - stand - sit ) end block - 5 minute break - salivary sample collect . The order posture change within group time . In third ( final ) phase participant ask estimate workload mean NASA-TLX questionnaire follow 30 minute rest phase sit posture . During 30 min rest phase ( initial &amp; final ) participant watch documentary encourage talk . Salivary sample collect break study protocol follow morning , 20 minute wake , ascertain cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) . Salivary sample centrifuge store -80 °C subsequent test use chemiluminescent immunoassay . Heart-rate trunk movement measure start study protocol CAR measurement .</detailed_description>
