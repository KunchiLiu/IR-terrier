	<brief_summary>A randomized clinical trial investigate transcatheter ( TAVR ) versus surgical ( SAVR ) aortic valve replacement patient 75 year age young suffer severe aortic valve stenosis . Study hypothesis : The clinical outcome ( composite endpoint all-cause mortality , MI stroke ) obtain within 1 year TAVR non-inferior SAVR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Younger Low Surgical Risk Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acquired aortic valve stenosis ( AS ) common heart valve disease Western World prevalence 2-7 % age &gt; 65 year . If untreated , may lead heart failure death . Surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) recent year definitive treatment patient severe symptomatic AS . A less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) develop treatment choice mostly elderly high risk inoperable patient . As TAVR technology continuously evolve improve , may anticipate become valuable alternative - even preferred choice treatment - young , low-risk patient severe aortic valve stenosis near future . However , date , clinical evidence support hypothesis . AIM : The purpose study compare TAVR SAVR regard intra- post-procedural morbidity mortality rate , hospitalization length , functional capacity , quality life , valvular prosthesis function young , low risk patient severe AS , schedule aortic valve replacement . POPULATION : Younger low risk patient severe aortic valve stenosis , schedule aortic valve replacement use bioprosthesis . Subjects fulfil inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion , consent trial randomize 1:1 TAVR SAVR 496 patient group . DESIGN : The study randomize clinical multicenter trial . Central randomization variable block size stratification gender coronary comorbidity use . An independent event committee blind treatment allocation adjudicate safety endpoint . Interim analysis plan first 20 event include primary end-point ( all-cause mortality , stroke myocardial infarction ) . INTERVENTIONS : TAVR : Any CE-Mark approve transcatheter aortic bioprosthesis may use study , choice discretion local TAVR team . The transfemoral TAVR procedure may perform general anaesthesia , local anaesthesia/conscious sedation , local anesthesia . Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) perform 30 day prior TAVR hybrid procedure . SAVR : The surgical SAVR technique follow standard protocol local department cardio-thoracic surgery . The operation perform general anesthesia , follow standard protocol department anesthesiology . A commercial available surgical aortic bioprosthesis surgeon discretion implant . Concomitant coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery may perform . END POINTS : The primary endpoint composite rate all-cause mortality death , myocardial infarction stroke within one year procedure ( VARC-2 defintions ) . Secondary endpoint list . Follow-up perform 30 day , 3 month , 1 year yearly thereafter minimum 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 75 year younger . Severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) ( valve area &lt; 1cm2 &lt; 0.6 cm2/m2 ) , require valve replacement ( symptomatic angina pectoris , dyspnea exerciseinduced syncope near syncope OR asymptomatic abnormal exercise test showing symptom exercise clearly relate AS systolic LV dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 50 % ) due another cause . ) Anticipated usage biological aortic valve prosthesis . Low risk conventional surgery ( STS Score &lt; 4 % ) . Suitable SAVR transfemoral TAVR . Life expectancy &gt; 1 year intervention . Informed consent participate study adequate information study randomization intervention . Coronary artery disease , suitable percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . LVEF &lt; 25 % without contractile reserve dobutamine stress echocardiography . Porcelain aorta , prevents openheart surgery . Bicuspid valve aorta ascendens diameter â‰¥45mm Severe femoral , iliac aortic atherosclerosis , calcification , coarctation , aneurysm tortuosity , prevent transfemoral TAVR . Need open heart surgery SAVR without CABG . Myocardial infarction within last 30 day OR percutaneous coronary intervention require dual antiplatelet therapy within last six month . Coronary angiogram SYNTAXscore &gt; 22 . Previous openheart surgery previous mediastinal radiation therapy . Stroke TIA within last 30 day . Current endocarditis , intracardiac tumor , thrombus vegetation . Ongoing severe infection require intravenous antibiotic . Unstable preprocedural condition require intravenous inotropes mechanical assist device ( IABP , Impella ) day intervention . Kidney disease require dialysis severely impaired lung function ( FEV1 and/or diffusion capacity &lt; 40 % predict ) . Allergy heparin , iodid contrast agent , warfarin , aspirin clopidogrel .</criteria>
