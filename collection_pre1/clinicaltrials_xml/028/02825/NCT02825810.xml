	<brief_title>Cervical Motor Control Long-term Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Breast cancer become common disease ; however survival rate improve throughout last year . As result , also mean breast cancer survivor suffer side effect concern disease treatment , case certain kind pain . It know 80 % breast cancer survivor suffer even 5 year completion treatment impairment associate high tendency towards depression , cardiorespiratory deconditioning even alter cervical control motor . Aim : To determine effectiveness physical therapy program base cervical motor control train order improve motor control , mood state quality life . Methods : Fifty-two long-term breast cancer survivor allocate experimental group ( n=26 ) control group ( n=26 ) . The experimental group receive nine-week tailored exercise training focus cervical motor control . Discussion : There lack knowledge effective intervention come deal altered motor control pattern cervical area long-term breast cancer survivor . Therefore , necessary study impact novel approach improve quality life population .</detailed_description>
