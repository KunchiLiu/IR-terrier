	<detailed_description>Males , diagnose CRPC , fulfil inclusion criterion exclusion criterion , ask participate study . The subject inform orally write study procedure give write informed consent , prior study start . At screen visit follow examination perform : Physical examination , medical history concomitant medication . Heart rate , blood pressure , weight , height , body temperature respiratory rate measure . Blood sample draw urine sample collect . ECG record . Bone scan diagnostic CT scan also perform . At next visit , baseline , subject examine physically heart rate , blood pressure , weight , body temperature respiratory rate measure , ECG record , blood sample draw urine sample collect . FACT-P EQ-5D-5L ( European Quality Life - 5 Dimensions 5 level ) questionnaire fill subject . Adverse event concomitant medication document first dose investigational product give . The subject survey 3 hour hospital . The duration study individual subject approximately 20 week screen follow-up visit 2 week last dose . Each subject receive 10 dos investigational product . After follow-up visit , subject enters long-term follow-up phase last approximately 2 year . A Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) designate responsible monitor/review study relate safety data . After review safety data DMC provide recommendation whether dose escalation proceed plan accord protocol .</detailed_description>
