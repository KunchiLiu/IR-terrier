	<brief_summary>Title Research Program : Ultrasound Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block : Influence Obesity Block Failure Rate , Performance Time Incidence Acute Complications- A prospective observational cohort study Background : Axillary brachial plexus ( ABP ) block commonly perform primary anesthetic technique provide surgical anesthesia postoperative analgesia elbow , forearm hand surgery . Compared general anesthesia , ABP block show result well pain relief , less nausea vomiting , shorten length hospital stay , decreased side effect opioids painkiller well patient satisfaction . These beneficial effect ABP block particularly useful patient overweight obese cohort high risk experience complication general anesthesia . Traditionally , nerve block describe technically challenge obese patient . This may true availability high-resolution ultrasonography ( US ) . US image also allow doctor ability visualize needle `` live '' allow accurate needle placement . This allow local anesthetic place precisely result faster onset anesthesia , decrease local anesthetic drug dosage , reduce complication high success rate . Ultrasound guidance use perform ABP block previous study obese patient . Hypothesis : We hypothesize block failure rate worse obese compare non-obese patient US guidance use perform ABP block . Specific Objectives : The primary objective study evaluate whether obese patient receive US guide ABP block primary anesthetic modality block success rate ( define Composite Score ≥ 14 30 minute ) bad non-obese peer . The secondary objective evaluate time parameter around ABP performance , incidence complication patient satisfaction . Methods : This study conduct observational quasi-experimental multicenter trial St. Joseph 's Health Care ( SJHC ) , London , ON Nova Scotia Health Authority ( NSHA ) Halifax Infirmary ( HI ) site , Halifax NS . There 250 patient take part study . One hundred fifty patient already complete study Ontario . The duration study Halifax Infirmary 10 month . Healthy patient ( age 18-75 year ) schedule undergo elbow/ forearm/ hand surgery invite volunteer observational study . A study investigator resident direction supervision study investigator perform ABP block . There NO experimental drug treatment study . Patient demographic include age , sex , arm circumference , height , weight Body Mass Index record . Nerve block perform designated area near operating room call block room . US use identification nerve supply arm ABP block perform total volume 30 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine accord standardized procedure . Measurements sensory motor blockage record every 5 minute 30 minute follow ABP block . Block success measure define score ≥ 14 Composite Score ( CS ) within 30 minute ABP block completion . According routine care , patient receive phone call investigator 24-48 hour surgery inquire complication . The study follow non-inferiority design show success rate obese group worse non-obese anesthetized . In non-inferiority trial , intention treat per-protocol analysis recommend ; approach support non-inferiority The student 's t-test ( unpaired , two tail ) use comparison mean continuous , normally distribute data Mann-Whitney U test appropriate . Categorical data ( success rate , complication rate ) analyze use χ2 test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . An interim analysis conduct set 0.05 significance 95 % confidence interval . Significance/ Importance : This study would provide anesthesiologist additional information inform clinical decision-making deal obese patient . To date publication register trial explore success rate technical aspect ABP blockade obese patient use US guidance technology block performance . Therefore , study novel timely patient group .</brief_summary>
