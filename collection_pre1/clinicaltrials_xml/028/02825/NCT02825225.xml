	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Trial Two Different Prostate Biopsy Schemes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer male 's leading solid non-cutaneous tumor , second cause cancer death western country . The main risk factor age ( 5th decade ) , family history life-style ( low physical activity occidental dietary habit ) . Due 's high incidence mortality , screen protocol continue support worldwide urologic oncologic society . The diagnosis disease need histological evidence obtain prostate biopsy indicate prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) serum level elevate suspicion digital rectal examination . Actual estimation conclude 200.000 new case diagnose per-year US much patient submit biopsy ; turn prostate biopsy routine medical procedure . In therms current medical evidence controversy biopsy aspect . The ideal number fragment obtain well establish . While twelve core believe minimum sampled , maximum number clear . To ease estimation number necessary core biopsy literature recommend use nomogram ; adequate number remove fragment accord individual characteristic age , volume , previous biopsy PSA level . The prostate biopsy consider painful procedure 96 % patient , therefore fundamental soften soreness employ form anesthesia . There consensus regard ideal protocol local anesthesia periprostatic blockade employ worldwide . However controversy related site injection periprostatic block term efficacy : base versus apex site . Considering epidemiological importance prostate cancer detection continuous age population , study protocol enrol single center high volume urology Brazilian Public Hospital . The patient randomize 1:1 ratio two biopsy scheme two anesthesia templates.The main objective compare detection rate two different prostate biopsy scheme 20-core versus 12-core prostate biopsy guide transrectal ultrasound . Secondary objective evaluate pain perception two local anesthesia scheme use validated pain scale . The pain evaluate use visual pain scale immediately biopsy one hour procedure . The patient contact phone one week biopsy ass occurrence complication . The investigator compare major minor complication rate 20-core versus 12-core protocol use Clavien-Dindo scale . In patient cancer pathologic report underwent radical prostatectomy , investigator also compare concordance Gleason score biopsy versus surgical specimen accord biopsy scheme 20-core versus 12-core . Data collect since mid 2012 june 2016 , inclusion exclusion criterion detail elsewhere . All information obtain main investigator procedure supervise main investigator well .</detailed_description>
