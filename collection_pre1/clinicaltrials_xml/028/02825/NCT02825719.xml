	<brief_summary>Uterine leiomyoma commonest benign tumour female genital tract . It lead menorrhagia , anaemia , pain pressure symptom . Due enlarge uterus , use minimal invasive surgery limit . There also increase risk intraoperative blood transfusion . Ulipristal acetate ( UPA ) selective progesterone-receptor modulator ( SPRM ) . Preoperative use Ulipristal 12 week show decrease uterine bleeding , fibroid volume , pre-operative anaemia symptom severity . However still lack evidence term long term safety efficacy , especially Chinese population . The aim present study evaluate effect safety preoperative use Ulipristal fibroid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma commonest benign tumour female genital tract . It often asymptomatic , also lead anaemia , pain pressure symptom . It common indication hysterectomy , especially abdominal hysterectomy . Currently , use hormonal treatment associate side effect include gastrointestinal upset , bloating , weight gain thromboembolic risk . The main stay treatment rely surgery . Furthermore , use minimal invasive surgery limit size fibroid . Preoperative use Gonadotrophic Releasing Hormone analogue ( GnRHa ) effective shrinkage uterine leiomyoma reduction uterine bleeding . However , postmenopausal symptom include hot flush , vaginal dryness profound . Ulipristal acetate ( UPA ) , previously name CDB-2914 , selective progesterone-receptor modulator ( SPRM ) . It bind progesterone receptor high affinity . It inhibit follicular development ovulation , significant effect estradiol level antiglucocorticoid activity . Preoperative use Ulipristal symptomatic uterine fibroid investigate randomize control study improvement term uterine bleeding , fibroids volume , pre-operative anaemia symptom severity . However still lack evidence term long term safety efficacy . Also lack evidence Chinese population . The aim present study evaluate effect safety preoperative use Ulipristal fibroid .</detailed_description>
