	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-controlled trial standard medical care plus TORAYMYXIN PMX-20R ( PMX cartridge ) , subject endotoxemia septic shock . Subjects ICUs assess septic shock use know suspected infection hypotension require vasopressor support primary criterion . Endotoxemia assess use Endotoxin Activity Assay . Consented eligible subject receive two intervention PMX cartridge approximately 24 hour apart.The status subject follow 28 day , long term follow-up complete 3 month , 6 month 12 month . This continue access study subsequent EUPHRATES clinical trial NCT01046669 .</detailed_description>
