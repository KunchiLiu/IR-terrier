	<brief_title>Destruction Residual Endo-biliary Dysplastic Buds After Endoscopic Ampullectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoplastic lesion may persist termination common bile duct pancreatic duct , endoscopic ampullectomy adenoma . Such lesion conduct difficult therapeutic problem surgery ( pancreaticoduodenectomy trans-duodenal resection ) significant morbidity compare non-invasive lesion . The use endoscopic destruction technique dysplastic lesion , include radio-frequency could interest alternative reduce risk invasive cancer less morbidity . Ablation radio-frequency ( RF ) technique local tissue destruction use many application , percutaneously intraoperatively treatment hepatocellular carcinoma small recently endoscopic treatment high-grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus . An RF probe develop endo-biliary application ( Habib EndoHPB , Emcision ) 2 preliminary study report use human , indication unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . These two study confirm feasibility technique , side effect probable anti-tumor efficacy demonstrate expand area stenosis treatment .</detailed_description>
