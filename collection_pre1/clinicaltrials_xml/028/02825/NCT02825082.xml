	<brief_title>Emergency Surgery Elderly : Comparison Frailty Index Surgical Risk Score</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : nowadays become old consider result socioeconomic development improvement health care system worldwide . The life expectancy average person double course last century currently estimate 85-90 year western countries.. The number elderly people increase dramatically next decade population projection towards 2040 indicate 66 % increase age-groups 65 74 year . More importantly , age group 75 year project increase &gt; 100 % , clearly implication future health service . Thus , acute medical insult may thus deprive healthy 65- 75-years old person considerable number future life-years ( 20-30 year ) , either live dependency . Older adult make large portion surgical practice worldwide . In 2010 , 37 % inpatient operation perform United States patient 65 year old , percentage rise come decade . Also , increase age come add risk additional disease well use drug , clearly interfere emergency surgical condition . Elderly patient life-threatening abdominal disease undergo emergency surgery increase number despite recent advance surgical anaesthetic technique , elderly patient increase risk major perioperative complication delirium , urinary incontinence , pressure ulcer , depression , infection , functional decline adverse drug affect , long hospital stay , postoperative institutionalization . Even control co-morbid illness functional impairment , age remain independent risk factor adverse postoperative event . Elderly receive acute surgery often survive initial treatment , often suffer severe complication due comorbidity . If complication occur , lead cascade event result disability , loss independence , diminish quality life , high health care cost , mortality . It important close post-operative follow avoid life threaten complicate condition , involve geriatric consultant specialty need . Additional surgery aggressive life-prolonging care , case , harm good . Surgical decision make population challenge heterogeneity health status old adult paucity tool predict operative risk . Commonly use predictor postoperative complication substantial limitation ; base single organ system subjective , none estimate patient 's physiologic reserve . therefore may need undergo special pretreatment assessment incorporate frailty assessment . Frailty commonly associate old adult identify decreased reserve multiple organ system disease , lack activity , inadequate nutrition , stress , physiological change age . Given inevitable rise age population , vital surgeon understand concept frailty may affect surgical decision outcome . Improving outcomes emergency surgery geriatric population multifaceted task great clinical health care system implication . valuation current practice important improve outcome future . Acting identify deficit find new area research important improve outcome elderly . AIM : evaluate stratification surgical risk patient &gt; 65yo underwent general emergency surgery . To evaluate specific parameter variables new score elderly patient . To underline hotspot management patient . STUDY DESIGN : retrospective prospective cohort , multicenter , observational , profit clinical study . All study participant collect data elderly patient underwent general emergency surgery 18 month old period , guarantee whole completeness pick data &gt; 95 % . This study approve Health Sciences Research Ethics Board University Rome La Sapienza .</detailed_description>
