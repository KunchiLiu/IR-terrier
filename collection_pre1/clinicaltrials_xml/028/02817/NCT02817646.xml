	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether protein intake first day intensive care admission , relation body composition intensive care admission assess compute tomography scan make routine care , related clinical outcome critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ICU Patients Regarding Protein Intake CT-derived Body Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal protein energy intake show relevant reduce mortality prospective observational study mechanically ventilate patient admit intensive care unit . However , nutritional status ( protein mass , muscle mass ) patient admission possible consequence clinical outcome largely unknown . Computerized tomography scan use assess muscle mass proxy body protein mass . The investigator especially interested effect protein intake clinical outcome intensive care patient different body protein mass admission . This relevant appropriate formulation clinical ( protein ) nutrition patient group . Therefore , relationship protein intake patient outcome evaluate intensive care patient low muscle normal muscle area , use muscle area compute tomography scan proxy body protein mass . Additionally , data compute tomography scan regard muscle quality muscle- fat quantity use evaluate prognostic value body composition intensive care admission . Finally , abdominal compute tomography scan compare thoracic compute tomography scan .</detailed_description>
