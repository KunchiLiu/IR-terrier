	<brief_summary>The waveform plethysmographic signal use establish index predict fluid responsiveness ( ∆POP : respiratory variation plethysmographic waveform pulse oximetry ) . This index validate study non-invasiveness seem interesting anesthesia . However , previous study investigator evaluate correlation result provide index ( ∆POP ) reference index ( ∆PP : pulse pressure variation ) , obtain result significantly low previously describe . In study , index calculate record filtered signal . This unavoidable application filter anesthesia monitor could contribute discrepancy ∆POP ∆PP . The realization new study , compare ∆PP ∆POP obtain unfiltered plethysmographic signal , answer ∆POP ability use place ∆PP .</brief_summary>
