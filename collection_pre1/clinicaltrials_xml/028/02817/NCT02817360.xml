	<detailed_description>Purpose rationale The purpose study evaluate effect high dose Renin-Angiotensin System ( RAS ) -antagonists beta-blocker treatment primary prevention cardiac event population patient Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) evidence preexist cardiac disease . An additional aim demonstrate interaction concentration amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP surrogate imminent cardiac risk ) treatment effect economic impact intervention overall biomarker stratify subgroup . Primary objective Superiority high dose treatment RAS-antagonists beta-blockers compare conventional therapy regard reduction unplanned hospitalization death due cardiac event T2DM patient NT-proBNP &gt; 125pg/ml . Co-primary objective Superiority high dose treatment RAS-antagonists beta-blockers compare conventional therapy regard reduction unplanned hospitalization death due cardiac event T2DM patient whole population Secondary objective Dependency treatment efficacy ( reduction unplanned hospitalization death due cardiac event T2DM patient ) NT-proBNP concentration ( interaction effect NT-proBNP concentration treatment ) . Population The study population consist patient T2DM without history sign cardiac disease . Patients approximately 20 center worldwide include study randomize 1:1 intensive conventional therapy . It estimate 3000 patient screen In order include 2400 patient . The screen failure rate anticipate approximately 20 % . Investigational reference therapy All eligible patient randomize receive either high dose RAS-antagonists beta-blockers ( defined section investigational drug ) top standard diabetes therapy solely standard diabetes therapy . The use RAS-antagonist beta-blocker therapy randomization allow control group ( exception maximal dosage ) , prescription titration study period encourage . However , investigator feel prescription up-titration require thorough justification mandatory . Every attempt make use blood pressure lower drug RAS-antagonists beta-blockers control group . Study design This study randomize open-label , parallel group , active-controlled , two-arm , long-term morbidity mortality trial evaluate efficacy safety high dose RAS-antagonist beta-blocker therapy ( defined section investigational drug ) compare standard diabetes therapy patient diabetes without history sign cardiac disease . The goal include 2400 patient . The observation period plan last two year . However , trial event drive continue predefined event rate reach . The total trial duration expect last four year ( two year recruitment two year observation period last patient ) . Every patient remain study two year randomization . Visit 1 Screening At first visit eligibility enter study assess investigator . All inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate . Informed consent obtain . Demographic data drug prescription assess . Blood obtain . Blood chemistry assess locally . NT-proBNP determine point care system locally . The investigator blind result , send central computer . Blood obtain core lab , centrifuge store -80° Celsius local unit . Vital sign obtain . Randomization perform electronically , way randomization perform immediately . Visit 2 ( 3 month ) At visit 2 vital sign obtain . Blood drawn . Blood chemistry parameter assess locally safety reason . Drug prescription document . Visit 3 ( 12 month ) At visit 3 vital sign obtain . Blood drawn . Blood chemistry parameter assess locally safety reason . Drug prescription document . Visit 4 EOS ( end study ) ( 24 month ) At visit 4 vital sign obtain . Blood drawn . Blood chemistry parameter assess locally safety reason . Additional blood sample send core laboratory . Drug prescription document . Visit 1-4 mandatory patient . Long-term follow-up Patients follow population register telephone contact respectively completion study determine long-term mortality hospitalization . Unscheduled visit treatment group The treatment group additional visit up-titration RAS-antagonists beta- blocker visit 1 visit 2 . The frequency treat physician dependent titration step . A visit mandatory titration step . Patients receive logbook investigator , weekly up- titration step drug . Additionally , patient receive diary daily documentation blood pressure , heart rate symptom measurement technically feasible patient . Based measurement , data laboratory result investigator decide up-titration medication possible . Systolic blood pressure decrease permanently 100 mmHg heart 60bpm permanently . Recommended drug recommend dosage outline section `` Treatment '' . At visit , blood chemistry eGFR , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , sodium potassium obtain safety reason . Details eye-substudy : The PONTIAC Eye Study mask longitudinal follow previously 1:1 randomized study patient participate PONTIAC 2 study . It plan include 130 consecutive patient biannually visit study period 2 year . Study patient ( n=130 ) assign Department Ophthalmology Optometry Medical University Vienna include PONTIAC 2 Study one participate Centers Vienna . The investigator mask patient 's randomization . The primary objective sub-study : Superiority treatment arm RAS-antagonists beta-blockers compare conventional therapy regard thickness-change retinal nerve fiber layer outer nuclear layer measure spectral domain optical coherence tomography .</detailed_description>
