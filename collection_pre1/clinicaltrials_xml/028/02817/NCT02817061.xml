	<brief_summary>Aim : Investigate whether transcranial photobiomodulation ( tPBM ) use near-infrared light exposure head , improve frontal lobe executive function , work memory overall mood normal volunteer participant . Hypothesis : The investigator predict tPBM increase cognitive functioning , measure Cambridge Cognition cognitive testing study subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Light Enhancement Cognition Transcranial Repeated Application ( ELECTRA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photobiomodulation ( PBM ) , also call low-level light therapy ( LLLT ) , use optical power density less 100 mW/cmÂ² , usually red ( 600-700 nm ) near infrared ( NIR ) 780-1000 nm wavelength range . Different light source ( coherent laser non-coherent LEDs ) use PBM show produce beneficial cellular effect responsible preservation recovery tissue function control trial wide range disorder typify stress injury degeneration . During PBM , absorption red near-infrared photon cytochrome c oxidase mitochondrial respiratory chain cause increase cellular respiration continue much long light present deliver appropriate fluence exposure duration . Primary cellular effect include increase mitochondrial activity ATP level , production low level reactive oxygen specie , induction transcription factor ( include pro- survival NF-kB ) , inhibition apoptosis . Over past decade several study report single , transcranial PBM treatment 810 nm deliver head significant , beneficial effect use treat acute ischemic stroke several different animal model also human clinical trial . A similar approach use treat acute traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) mouse human . Pathological examination mouse brain demonstrate up- regulation brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) stimulate neurogenesis hippocampus increase synaptogenesis cortex . A clinical trial currently progress MGH treat person acute moderate TBI . Several study show improvement cognitive function person chronic TBI . Studies also conduct animal model person Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , depression anxiety . Only limited number study far carry test NIR photobiomodulation normal experimental rodent normal human volunteer . In study , LED array light source use clear FDA human us .</detailed_description>
