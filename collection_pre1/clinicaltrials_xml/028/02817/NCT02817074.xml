	<detailed_description>Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention Neurodegenerative Delay ( MIND ) Phase III randomize control trial design test effect 3-year intervention hybrid Mediterranean DASH diet , call MIND , cognitive decline among 600 individual 65+ year without cognitive impairment overweight suboptimal diet . The propose MIND diet hybrid Mediterranean DASH diet select modification base compelling evidence diet-dementia field . The MIND diet basic component DASH Mediterranean diet , emphasis natural plant-based food limit animal high saturate fat food , uniquely specify green leafy vegetable berry well food component serving reflect nutrition-dementia evidence . The trial employ parallel group design compare effect cognitive outcome MIND intervention diet plus mild caloric restriction weight loss control diet , usual diet mild caloric restriction weight loss . Biological effect MIND diet assess measurement brain macro- micro-structural integrity 300 randomly select participant . Other biochemical marker assess entire cohort 600 participant , include : plasma Abeta 42/Abeta 40 , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) plasma marker oxidative stress inflammation . In addition , trial examine potential effect mediator modifier number cardiovascular risk factor , AD biomarkers , biological mechanism . The propose study two clinical site , one Chicago ( Rush University ) one Boston ( Harvard University ) , centralized laboratory data coordinate analysis ( Brigham &amp; Women 's Hospital ) , neuroimaging analysis ( Rush University ) , specialized laboratory tissue biochemical analysis .</detailed_description>
