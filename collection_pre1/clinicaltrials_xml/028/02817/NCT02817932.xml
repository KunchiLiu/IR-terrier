	<brief_summary>The purpose study : To assess pharmacokinetic profile safety ranolazine PR healthy Korean Caucasian volunteer oral administration Ranolazine dose 375 , 500 , 750mg single repeat oral administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Pharmacokinetics Safety Ranolazine PR Healthy Korean Caucasian Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ranolazine antianginal drug exerts effect inhibition late sodium current cardiac cell . This action reduce intracellular sodium accumulation consequently decrease intracellular calcium overload expect reduce myocardial stiffness , oxygen consumption ATP utilization improve blood flow microvasculature.These effect ranolazine depend upon reduction heart rate blood pressure vasodilation . Ranolazine PR , approve treatment chronic angina 56 country currently market 21 country include US show clinical efficacy tolerability propose therapeutic dose range 375 mg 750mg . Factors may affect ranolazine pharmacokinetics include demographic , drug-drug interaction , disease state , CYP2D6 metabolizer genotype status impair renal hepatic function study . The relationship ranolazine plasma concentration clinical effect also well-established . This PK study design bridge study Ranolazine PR registration Korea .</detailed_description>
