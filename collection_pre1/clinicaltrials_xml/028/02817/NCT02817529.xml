	<brief_title>Comparison Two Positive Expiratory Pressure Devices Stable COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) therapy type airway clearance therapy patient exhales resistance , help shift pressure point aid mobilization sputum prevent lung collapse . PEP therapy help patient reduce need ventilatory support , improve hyperinflation dyspnea . Although PEP device use , study compare beneficial effect preference among COPD patient . Objective : The purpose research compare two PEP device ( Pulmonica , RC-Cornet ) stable COPD patient . . Methods : A baseline assessment patient take beginning , three month end six month , include patient ' ability clear secretion via Breathlessness , Cough Sputum Scale ( BCSS ) , patient ' self-reported quality life via St. George 's Respiratory questionnaire ( SGRQ ) COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) score , pt 's satisfaction device , cardio-pulmonary function via pulmonary function test six minute walk test three six month . Subsequently , patient randomly assign PEP device ( Pulmonica , RC-Cornet ) give instruction properly use device include frequency PEP therapy . Each patient receive monthly follow-up call order determine adherence satisfaction PEP therapy , also BCSS , SGRQ CAT score .</detailed_description>
