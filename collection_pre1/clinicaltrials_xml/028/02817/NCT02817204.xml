	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect aerobic exercise training microcirculation rarefaction Chinese young male primary hypertensive patient stage 1 . Hypertension one common world-wide chronic disease , show grow young trend , mild blood pressure elevate would diagnose time blood pressure raise symptom show ( Mild blood pressure indicate blood pressure range 140 159 mmHg systolic and/or 90 99 mmHg diastolic ) . However , cumulative evidence prove microvascular rarefaction exist hypertensive patient even primary hypertension stage 1 . Exercise prescription gathering great importance preventive health . Aerobic exercise , especially , potential diminish blood pressure value , aerobic exercise promote angiogenesis coronary heart disease . Notch signal play important role vascular formation maintenance . However , prospective , randomize , control , clinic trial investigate effect exercise microcirculation rarefaction hypertension . In summary , investigator propose hypothesis aerobic exercise might blood pressure low effect also improve microcirculation rarefaction Chinese male adult primary mild hypertension . For , subject enrol one pre-intervention cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) randomize aerobic exercise intervention group control group ( health education ) , intervention carry Cycle Ergometer , protocol consist 3 session day : 3 minute Warm , 45 minute Resistance Exercise 75 % HRmax ; 10 minute Recovery . Thus 58 minute day 5 day week ( 2000kcal ) 12 week total . Prior intervention session ( 12 week ) , nail fold capillary microscopy retinal capillary Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) angiography assess , well 24h blood pressure monitoring , echocardiography , forearm blood flow reactive hyperemia venous occlusion plethysmography ( FMD ) , PWV , central arterial pressure , RHI Endopat , also quantification endothelial progenistor cell ( EPCs ) separate peripheral blood .</brief_summary>
