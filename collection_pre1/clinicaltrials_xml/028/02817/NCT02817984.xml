	<brief_title>Safety Study Acellular Adipose Tissue Soft Tissue Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12-week , prospective , Phase I study healthy volunteer assess safety tolerability acellular adipose tissue ( AAT ) intend repair soft tissue defect human . Up five ( 5 ) 2 milliliter ( mL ) subcutaneous injection AAT administer redundant tissue previously identify schedule surgical removal elective surgical procedure . Participants enrol assign chronologically one five excision time point : Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 post-injection . Implants inject Day 0 . A safety visit occur 1 week post-injection ; follow-up visit occur Weeks 2 4 ( patient still implant ) post-injection time tissue excision . At end assign study time point , participant AAT implant remove simultaneously elective surgery . Implants assess use histopathological analysis include hematoxylin eosin stain flow cytometry . The primary outcome safety determine incidence rate adverse / unanticipated event . Secondary outcome include histopathological assessment explanted implant tolerability determine participant-reported comfort physician-reported ease-of-use intervention .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy men woman age 1865 year seek elective surgery removal redundant tissue abdomen ( abdominoplasty panniculectomy ) arm ( brachioplasty ) . Willingness delay elective surgery 12 week order participate study . Consent photography research purpose . Willingness follow study requirement . Ability give inform consent . Participants must willing perform follow visit 5 month . Undergo complete blood count ( CBC ) Differential Serum Chemistry . ( Results must fall within 1.5 time normal range value candidate eligible . ) Men Women reproductive potential : Willingness use approve method birth control abstain sexual intercourse screen removal AAT implant . Definition nonchildbearing potential Women : amenorrhea ( previous 12 month ) surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ) . Definition nonreproductive potential Men : confirm surgically sterile ( vasectomy &gt; 3 month prior screen ) . Patients seek elective surgery removal redundant tissue area abdomen arm . Use AAT patient exhibit autoimmune connective tissue disease recommend . When applied properly , AAT show support migration host cell surround tissue . Therefore , study exclude patient condition could inhibit migration host cell include , limited , follow : Fever ( oral temperature &gt; 99ยบ F time screen ) Insulin dependent diabetes Low vascularity tissue intend elective excision Local Systemic Infection Mechanical Trauma Poor nutrition general medical condition Dehiscence and/or necrosis due poor revascularization Specific nonspecific immune response component AAT material Infected nonvascular surgical site Known cancer receive treatment cancer Pregnant Lactating females Inability cooperate and/or comprehend postoperative instruction Inability speak read English Known allergy sensitivity Penicillin , Streptomycin , Amphotericin B Any reason study physician judge would contraindication receive AAT injection</criteria>
