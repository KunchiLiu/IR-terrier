	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Intensive Systolic Blood Pressure Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial ( CSPPT , NCT00794885 ) find among hypertensive adult China without history stroke myocardial infarction , combine use enalapril folic acid , compare enalapril alone , significantly reduce risk first stroke . The mean systolic blood pressure highly comparable two group course trial ( 139.7mmHg 139.8mmHg , respectively , enalapril-folic acid enalapril group ) . In analysis , low systolic blood pressure seem associated great reduction cardiovascular outcome treatment group . However , due inconsistency result ACCORD SPRINT trial , appropriate target systolic blood pressure effectively reduce cardiovascular event among hypertensive patient remain uncertain . The propose trial aim test hypothesis among hypertensive patient age 60 year old , low systolic blood pressure goal lead great reduction stroke incidence . The current feasibility study aim test whether blood pressure level study patient effectively safely manage accord intensive antihypertensive treatment protocol . Furthermore , study also examine effect intensive antihypertensive treatment intermediate cardiovascular disease outcome , include CIMT , carotid plaque , PWV ABI , kidney function , etc . The current feasibility study enroll approximately 100 patient H-type hypertension ( hypertensive patient hyperhomocysteinemia ) age 60 year old , without history major cardiovascular disease . Eligible patient randomly assign one three different systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) target group ( Group A , SBP : 140 - &lt; 150 mmHg ; Group B , SBP : 130 - &lt; 140 mmHg ; Group C , SBP &lt; 130 mmHg ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Hypertensive patient age 60 year old . SBP &gt; = 150 mmHg &lt; 180 mmHg , currently ( within previous two week ) regularly treat antihypertensive drug . If currently ( least 10 day medication within previous two week ) regularly treat antihypertensive drug , blood pressure must meet following criterion : SBP &gt; = 140 mmHg &lt; 170 mmHg , regularly ( less 10 day ) take 1 type antihypertensive medication within previous two week ; SBP &gt; = 130 mmHg &lt; 160 mmHg , regularly ( less 10 day ) take 2 type antihypertensive medication within previous two week ; SBP &gt; = 130 mmHg &lt; 150 mmHg , regularly ( less 10 day ) take 3 type antihypertensive medication within previous two week . For patient take fixeddosecombination ( FDC ) , treatment consider two type drug dose component FDC equal high routine therapeutic dose . Blood homocysteine ( Hcy ) ≥ 10μmol/L , patient take enalaprilfolic acid ; Subject read sign write , informed consent form . History physician diagnose stroke , myocardial infarction , heart failure , revascularization , malignancy ; Clearly diagnose secondary hypertension ; Undergoing regular renal dialysis diagnose endstage kidney disease ; Congenital acquire organic heart disease ; Severe somatic disease prevent participant complete trial , base discretion investigator , patient incapable participating ; Contraindicated intolerable ACEIs ( include enalaprilfolic acid ) history severe adverse effect ACEIs ; Individuals abnormal laboratory test result and/or clinical manifestation render unsuitable participate judge investigator ; Any factor likely limit adherence intervention jeopardize data collection , example : dementia , severe mental disorder impede expression communication ability , inability adhere followup plan , plan move near future , , history unreliability follow medication regimen keep appointment ; Living family member ( spouse , example ) already participate study ; Unwilling participate , unwilling unable change current therapeutic regimen ; Currently ( within one month ) participate another new drug trial .</criteria>
