	<brief_summary>In study , investigator determine whether patient elevated level LDL characterize specific epigenetic change circulate cell innate immune system , compare control subject healthy level LDL whether regular statin treatment influence change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Statins Trained Immunity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The innate immune system play pivotal role development progression atherosclerosis . Recently , report monocyte develop long-lasting immunological memory stimulation various microorganism , term 'trained innate immunity ' . This memory induce epigenetic reprogramming . Here investigator hypothesize monocyte patient elevate LDL cholesterol level show epigenetic change compare normocholesterolemic subject reverse treatment statin . Objective : The main objective study whether patient elevated level LDL show increase Histone 3 Lysine 4 trimethylation promoter region pro-inflammatory cytokine augment ex vivo Toll-Like Receptor agonist-induced cytokine production isolate monocyte compare control . Subsequently investigator study effect treatment statins response . Study design : Observational study Study population : Subjects age &gt; 18 year refer out-patient clinic LDL level require lipid lower treatment match normocholesterolemic control subject .</detailed_description>
