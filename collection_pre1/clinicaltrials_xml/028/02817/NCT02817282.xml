	<brief_title>Compliance With Hand Hygiene Nursing Homes : Go Sustainable Effect ( CHANGE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sub study I : In observational study , current HH compliance assess participate NHs , use direct unobtrusive observation . The primary outcome percentage opportunity HH perform accordance WHO guideline . Direct observation use consider gold standard reliable method assess compliance rate . Direct observation make possible examine quantify require moment HH ass quality practice . Strigley et al . show HH compliance rate approximately threefold high within eyesight auditor compare auditor visible . Therefore , observation perform unobtrusively diminish Hawthorne effectâ€”the possibility HCWs modify HH behavior response fact know study . At begin observation period , HCWs inform observer conduct research patient safety error , HH monitor . Only director ward inform real purpose observation . This method observation feasible previous project currently World Health Organisation ( WHO ) -recommended standard evaluate HH . Sub study II : Barriers facilitator perform HH . To develop successful HH strategy NHs , information need behavioral determinant HH compliance . In line study Grol among doctor nurse hospital nurse home , identify barrier related individual HCW ( e.g . convinced evidence , work routine ) ; social context within team ( e.g . mutual accountability control , leadership ) ; healthcare organisation ( high workload , insufficient facility ) . Perceived barrier adherence HH guideline also include skin irritation cause HH agent , interference HCWs ' relationship patient , patient need perceive priority HH , lack scientific information show HH prevents cross-infection . Erasmus et al . find also negative role model , poor accessibility material poor social culture hamper good HH . Finally , recent Cochrane review effectiveness 'tailored ' strategy give foundation assumption strategy change effective deliberately address identified barrier . In study barrier facilitator experience perform HH Dutch NHs explore . From literature barrier guideline implementation combine literature study barrier perform HH , barrier questionnaire previously develop use Helping Hands study . To ensure questionnaire contains possible barrier experience NH setting , focus group discussion HCWs NHs perform . Newly mention barrier include questionnaire . Next , questionnaire study perform among random sample professional , minimum 25 participate NH identify frequently experienced barrier among professional . Sub study III : development HH implementation strategy individual orient activity . Education base different determinant influence HCWs ' behavior . Reminders support actual performance HH use distribute poster emphasize importance HH , particularly alcohol-based hand disinfection . Performance feedback effective tool increase awareness , often effective improve HH short period . Different medium use communicate feedback HH performance unit comparison experimental unit . The result also discuss staff meeting . This element embed pre-existing work routine . Goal set encouraged performance feedback use help HCWs evaluate success determine could best adapt behavior order reach goal . Planning improvement ; HCWs ' busy day day activity increase make action plan ( implementation intention ) , part education program HCWs assist make concrete plan solution everyday problem encounter concern HH , use if-then plan ( web base and/or group ) . Concretely involve formulate plan intend perform hand hygiene ( i.e . wash resident , first walk hand alcohol dispenser ) . This type intervention show promising result create new habit change fix behaviour area public health . Organisational orient activity Products facility : The physical environment adapt screen improve availability hand base hand rub . Team-oriented activity : The social environment adapt training group individual level , improve social descriptive norm . Positive role model stimulate training , particularly senior HCWs encourage improve behavior role model . The intervention deliver two interactive team session period 6 month . The first 1,5-h team session start present discuss current team performance HH . Team member explore HH behavior , analyse barrier facilitator formulate improvement activity . Next , team member develop clear set behavior communication expectation address case inappropriate HH . The meeting end commitment team member achieve substantial increase HH compliance . During second session , ward manager present HH compliance rate previous period . Team member discuss question like : Is goal achieve ? What improvements implement ? How maintain improve behavior ? What go wrong ? Next , attention focus maintenance achieve result . Implementation CHANGE : In order increase success implementation , extensive strategy put place prior start intervention period . In NH contact person appoint : coordinate Infection Control Practitioner ( ICP ) . With roll-out CHANGE package NH discuss . At start intervention kick-off meeting plan participate NH . HCWs instruct signal component intervention interfere work activity , effective measure solve problem set motion swiftly . Education team training timely plan integrate regular work meeting exist educational course . The implementation phase per NH last 4 month . During period two year , NHs receive implementation strategy . Sub study IV evaluation HH implementation strategy . The implementation strategy test step wedge cluster randomize trial base random sequential roll-out CHANGE implementation strategy participate NHs ( n=20 ) comparison . All group ( hence NHs ) start control situation ( CHANGE implementation activity ) begin study . At time point , new group five NHs cross control situation implementation situation . Each group start implementation phase 4 month different time point , directly one measurement period ( Point time ( PT ) 0 , PT1 , PT2 , PT3 , PT4 , PT5 ) . The time point group cross randomize ( group ) . Randomization computer generate independent statistician recruitment cluster complete . By end two year study period , group ( hence NHs ) receive CHANGE implementation strategy . Sub study V : Exploratory economic evaluation . Costs HAIs high HH effective measure reduce infection . It estimate 15 30 % HAIs prevent avoid cross-transmission micro-organisms hand HCWs . An improvement HH compliance potential lead substantial health care cost saving . Therefore , strategy focus increase adherence effective HH guideline likely cost-effective . To date , little known cost induce non-compliance HH NHs . To assess cost implication inadequate HH , economic evaluation conduct healthcare perspective . The economic evaluation perform accordance Dutch guideline , general principle cost-effectiveness analysis healthcare . In CHANGE implementation strategy HH compliance participate NHs increase subsequently lead decrease incidence HAIs . Data collect healthcare use HAIs monitor participate NHs . For calculation potential cost saving due less infection , use antibiotic drug , contact isolation precaution , extra consultation elderly care physician , diagnostic test , extra medical care , hospital transportation hospital admission register . Weekly , participate NHs register incidence HAIs . This registration make possible compare incidence infection intervention period incidence infection intervention period . This allow possibility calculate cost-effectiveness improve HH , define cost CHANGE strategy minus less cost treat infection , divide difference HAIs intervention period . Sub study VI : process evaluation . A process evaluation perform intervention investigate feasibility implementation strategy illuminate mechanism process responsible result variation within NHs . For purpose , different implementation activity participation level HCWs order determine correlation implementation effect ( i.e. , result implementation strategy HH compliance ) adherence implementation strategy ( i.e. , degree implementation ) register . To understand success -or lack success- implementation strategy , evaluation use three set measure related effect HCWs ' HH compliance : adherence improvement strategy , contextual factor , HCWs ' experience strategy component . Information adherence improvement strategy contextual factor collect use wide range method , include : observation , NH structure survey , structure logbooks coach researcher ' field note group meeting etc . For example , participation implementation activity monitor closely , document participation regard activity : e.g . participate educational meeting , read his/her individual feedback report etc . This information crucial understanding result implementation strategy , also provide basic data economic evaluation improvement activity . Information HCWs ' experience strategy component collect information crucial understanding result implementation strategy , also measure , necessary , adapt strategy make acceptable effective future user strategy .</detailed_description>
