	<detailed_description>Eligible hemodialysis patient currently receive erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) enrol sign consent randomize 1:1 basis either remain epoetin alfa switch darbepoetin alfa anemia therapy . Patients dose assigned drug use study algorithm maintain hemoglobin ( Hb ) level within currently recommend range ( 100-120 g/L ) . There initial `` run '' period minimum six week ensure patient 's hemoglobin stable within target range . The trial run subsequent twelve month ( active phase ) . Every effort make ensure Hb stay within target range study period . The primary outcome total cost ESA therapy twelve month active phase . Data include Hgb , iron index dose , clinical event obtain electronic source attend physician and/or clinical pharmacist .</detailed_description>
