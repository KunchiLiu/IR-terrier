	<brief_summary>Arterial thromboembolism constitute major risk atrial fibrillation ( AF ) require antithrombotic therapy . Platelets microparticles ( MPs ) important hemostasis thrombosis , role AF well known . The principal objective study compare morphologic , functional proteomics characteristic blood platelet AF patient healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Characterization Blood Platelet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AF associate decrease quality life increase risk thromboembolic event . AF lead cause embolic stroke . Identification factor may influence blood coagulability patient could better identify therapeutic target optimize anticoagulation . Platelets play major role coagulation process , study may provide valuable information . Moreover microparticles platelet activation know pathophysiological effect include effect thrombosis inhibition fibrinolysis . It also show microparticles role endothelial dysfunction generation inflammatory condition associate atrial fibrillation . Investigators propose project , comparative study AF patient healthy volunteer . Complete characterization platelet ( morphology , platelet function , platelet proteome ) microparticles level perform . Different site blood sampling ( systemic cardiac ) do patient ablation procedure . Patients follow hospitalisation .</detailed_description>
