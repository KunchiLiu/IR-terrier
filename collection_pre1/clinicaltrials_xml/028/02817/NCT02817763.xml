	<brief_title>A New Surgical-restorative Approach Treat Gingival Recessions Associated With Non-carious Cervical Lesions ( NCCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel control clinical trial . - Group CTG ( control n = 20 ) - patient receive connective tissue graft treat gingival recession associate non-carious cervical lesion . Group CTG+RC ( test n = 20 ) - patient receive connective tissue graft plus partial resin composite restoration treat gingival recession associate non-carious cervical lesion . The surgery , well postoperative follow-up , perform dental clinic Institute Science Technology ( ICT ) , State University São Paulo ( UNESP ) . For recession allocate CTG group , two horizontal incision make right angle adjacent interdental papilla , without interfere gingival margin neighbor teeth . Two oblique vertical incision extend beyond mucogingival junction , trapezoidal mucoperiosteal flap raise mucogingival junction . After point , split-thickness flap extend apically , release tension favor coronal position flap.The expose root surface gently scale planed become smooth CTG group . Afterwards , thin small connective tissue graft remove palatal site suture root surface . Then , flap coronally position suture completely cover graft . For recession allocate CTG+RC group , firstly sterile rubber dam place isolate operative field coronal zone non-carious cervical lesion restoration perform nanocomposite resin , follow manufacturer 's instruction . The apical margin restoration place 1 millimeter apically cemento-enamel junction estimation . In follow session CTG+RC receive surgical procedure describe thin small connective tissue graft remove palatal site suture root/restoration surface . Then , flap coronally position suture completely cover graft . Clinical parameter assess baseline 3 6 month post-operatively .</detailed_description>
