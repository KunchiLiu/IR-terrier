	<detailed_description>Malaria preventable treatable disease cause Plasmodium specie . In 2015 , It estimate , 1.8 million case malaria 400 , 000 death report , 90 % Africa . Those child die may suffer brain damage experience cognitive learning deficit result disease severity . Though significant progress make last decade towards achieve global malaria target , disease burden still relatively high sub-Saharan African country , especially among child &lt; 5 year age . Injectable artesunate ( Inj . AS ) life-saving medication indicate treatment severe/complicated malaria either intravenously intramuscularly . The current version ( 3rd edition ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) Guidelines Treatment Malaria strongly recommend , base high-quality evidence , adult child severe malaria treat `` intravenous intramuscular artesunate '' . Injectable Artesunate prequalified WHO Prequalification Scheme . It receive market authorization nearly malaria-endemic country million dos distribute use management severe malaria . Despite widespread usage Inj . AS , safety database product nearly empty WHO Individual Case Safety Reports ( ICSR ) database contain 2622 report artesunate include Inj AS . Inj AS consider safe product even though report rare serious haematological reaction relation use include post-treatment haemolysis subsequent anaemia , life-threatening require blood transfusion . Experts agree benefit Inj . AS far outweigh risk may pose form basis WHO recommendation use Inj . AS first product choice treat severe malaria except available case parenteral artemether recommend conditionally . In view million dose Inj AS deployed use year , important undertake focus , intensive safety surveillance medicine obtain continuous evidence benefits-risk profile also prevent undocumented rare serious adverse event act barrier uptake . Apart detail well-collected safety information obtain clinical trial , publish information real-life safety experience Inj . AS large cohort patient . This study therefore design obtain real-life safety experience Inj . AS use actual practice setting 4 African country - Ethiopia , Ghana , Malawi Uganda . The study design prospective , observational , longitudinal cohort study patient administer Inj AS course normal clinical practice . The method use cohort event monitor deploy study antimalarial suggest key method several post-authorisation safety study</detailed_description>
