	<brief_title>Tailored Operative Non-operative Management Low-risk Rectal Cancer After Intensive Neoadjuvant Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT ) , total mesorectal excision adjuvant chemotherapy comprise standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer , follow 15-30 % patient achieve pathological complete response need receive removal rectum without residual tumor suffer significant functional impairment even sphincter preservation . Adjuvant chemotherapy also question benefit prolonged survival data various study . More evidence demonstrate organ-preservation ( e.g . non-operative management local excision ) patient clinical complete response ( cCR ) near-cCR follow nCRT similar survival compare receive standard care . This study design investigate efficacy neoadjuvant intensity modulate nCRT concurrent capecitabine plus consolidation CapeOX T2/DWI/Enhanced MRI define cT2-T3b mid-low rectal cancer without threaten mesorectal fascia extramural vascular invasion ( EMVI ) mrN2 disease . According response treatment evaluate multi-modal assessment include digital exam , T2/DWI/Enhanced MRI , endoscopy serum CEA test , patient receive tailor operative management like local excision total mesorectal excision , non-operative management . Intention treatment also allow study . Firstly , investigator observe organ preservation rate 2 year . Endpoints organ-preservation like non-regrowth DFS , stoma-free survival conventional survival outcome ( DFS , OS ) would collect . The short-term long-term QoL measure patient . . Our baseline data show 48 % locally advanced rectal cancer could downstaged stage ypT0-2N0 follow IMRT concurrent capecitabine . We hypothesize least 24 % rectal cancer could candidate LE NOM IMRT rectum preservation rate increase 40 % low-risk rectal cancer LE NOM follow IMRT plus consolidation CapeOX 2 year . As superiority design , study need recruit 64 patient test hypothesis , 85 % power ( exact binomial test proportion , alpha = 5 % , one-sided ) , If number responses 22 , hypothesis P &lt; = 0.240 reject . We anticipate 10 % loss follow-up , recruit additional 8 patient study recruit 72 patient .</detailed_description>
