	<brief_summary>This hypothalamic obesity associate serious metabolic psychosocial consequence . The purpose study compare change body weight 6 month treatment lifestyle intervention + exenatide compare one lifestyle intervention+ placebo adult patient suffer hypothalamic obesity due treatment craniopharyngioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentre Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial Assessing Efficacy Safety Exenatide Treatment Hypothalamic Obesity After Craniopharyngioma Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analogue might solution since native GLP-1 suppresses appetite energy intake normal weight obese individual well people type 2 diabetes delay gastric empty . The underlying mechanism mediate effect weight involve central region like hypothalamus solitary tractus nucleus area postrema also peripheral region gastrointestinal tract . These extra hypothalamic effect particular interest case obesity due hypothalamic lesion . Exenatide glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analogue high structural homology human GLP-1 , gut derive incretin hormone . Since exenatide cause dose-dependent weight loss , decrease concentration glycosylated haemoglobin well improve ß-cell function systolic blood pressure , could attractive treatment type 2 diabetes obesity . In double-blind placebo-controlled 24-week trial , recently show non diabetic obese patient maintain exenatide 10µg x 2/j lose significantly weight placebo ( 5.1 kg versus 1.6 ) .</detailed_description>
