	<detailed_description>Introduction . Mechanical respiratory support preterm neonates respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) and/or apnoea prematurity ( AOP ) might associate adverse effect consequence positive pressure use ( barotrauma ) , excessive gas delivery ( volutrauma ) inadequate volume ( atelectrauma ) . All factor could give rise increase alveolo-capillary membrane permeability , alveoli oedema , hyaline membrane formation epithelial cell desquamation . These phenomenon eventually could lead activation inflammatory mediator ( biotrauma ) local systemic noxious effect . During assisted ventilation , lack synchrony patient effort ventilator support increase patient discomfort , favour `` fight '' machine , increase risk air trap lung overdistension . Even patient non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) , uneasiness respiratory distress would cause air hunger , develop intrapleural negative pressure risk lung overinflation despite use low airway positive pressure . The use neuromuscular blockade adult acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) associate decrease serum cytokine level 90 day adjust mortality . NAVA use diaphragmatic electrical activity ( Edi ) signal start rise pressure ventilator . Likewise , allow automatic adjustment peak inspiratory pressure ( PIP ) patient 's effort , provide variable tidal volume accord his/her need . Finally , system allow inspiratory cycle Edi decline ( normally set 70 % Edi Peak ) , , diaphragmatic relaxation . NAVA show faster response time well level synchronization traditional flow pressure system , achieve great comfort level adult paediatric patient . Some paediatric neonatal study show reduction PIP , without change mean airway pressure ( MAP ) , reduction oxygen requirement ( FiO2 ) . These change associate major complication ( intraventricular haemorrhage , pneumothorax , necrotizing enterocolitis ) . A relevant target neonatal ventilatory support minimize aggression lung respiratory system use NIV whenever possible , and/or extubating patient soon possible . For reason , profound sedation , analgesia , neuromuscular blockade rarely indicated newborn period . NAVA synchronization might improve patient comfort , prevent patient-ventilator fighting , lung overinflation episode ( volutrauma ) , ultimately reduce biotrauma . To knowledge investigator , study evaluate new ventilatory modality ( NAVA ) newborn period still scarce , potential reduce inflammation test . Objectives . To determine NIV-NAVA compare unsynchronized modality ( nCPAP/nIPPV ) , infant bear &lt; 32 week GA respiratory distress syndrome require prophylactic NIV ( immaturity , apnoea ) : 1 . Reduces systemic inflammation , measure serum cytokine concentration . 2 . Reduces need oxygen respiratory support . 3 . Increases probability survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . Design . Single centre , prospective control randomized clinical trial . Setting . Tertiary Hospital near 6000 birth per year Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) 15 bed approximately 250 admission per year . Methods . Informed consent ( IC ) obtain birth , mother ' admission threaten preterm labour . Once IC obtain infant 's birth , patient randomize random number table , keep sealed envelops , `` Group A '' ( NAVA ) `` Group B '' ( conventional strategy ) . In case meet inclusion criterion , cord blood sample collect determine level cytokine : Tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - α ) , interleukin ( IL ) 1 beta ( IL-1ß ) , IL-6 , IL-8 . The decision intubate delivery room provide NIV carry attend neonatologist time birth base clinical criterion . In unit , standard care intubation prophylactic surfactant administration delivery room neonates &lt; 25 week GA , old baby receive antenatal steroid need intubation resuscitation . Neonates 26 - 29 week GA adequate respiratory effort resuscitate transferred NICU NIV ( Neo-puff ® ) . Preterm baby &gt; 29 week GA receive respiratory support ( invasive NIV ) clinically indicate . After admission NICU , patient require invasive mechanical ventilation support accord need criterion attend neonatologist . In unit , modes volume guarantee ( VG ) volume control currently use : Assist/Control+VG , Synchronized - Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation ( S-IMV ) +VG , Pressure Regulated Volume Control ( PRVC ) . After extubation patient support non-invasively since beginning , NIV provide accord randomization group : Group A : With ventilator SERVO-n ( Maquet , Solna , Sweden ) , NIV-NAVA mode . The ventilation parameter ( PEEP , FiO2 , NAVA level , etc . ) establish adjust attend clinician accord patient 's need . Group B : With Infant Flow device ( CareFusion ) nCPAP non-synchronised Biphasic mode . The ventilation parameter ( Flow , PEEP , FiO2 , PIP level , etc . ) establish adjust attend clinician accord patient 's need . Surfactant ( Curosurf ® , 100 mg/kg ) administer accord clinical indication follow Unit 's protocol . In general , patient receive delivery room , administer soon possible NICU patient need FiO2 &gt; 0.3 . Intubated patient receive surfactant double lumen tube , NIV minimally invasive method , Insure ( intubate , surfactant , extubated ) method . Quantitative cytokine determination carry simultaneously sample X-MAP technology use Bioplex cytometer ( Biorad ) allow simultaneous measure multiple analytes .</detailed_description>
