	<brief_title>To Determine Metabolomics Microbiome Changes After Cranberry Juice Consumption Among Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption cranberry juice relate prevention urinary tract infection . However , due bitterness astringency cranberry product , compliance participant cranberry related clinical trial poor , make difficult study function cranberry juice . Accordingly , press need effective approach verify participant compliance . In previous study , plasma urinary metabolome young woman follow cranberry juice consumption investigate use global UHPLC ( Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography ) -Q-Orbitrap-HRMS ( High-resolution mass spectrometry ) approach . PLS-DA ( Partial least square discriminant analysis ) analyse showed plasma urinary metabolome young woman alter follow cranberry consumption compare baseline apple juice consumption . Cranberry juice consumption cause great excretion exogenous endogenous metabolite . These metabolite identify candidate biomarkers cranberry juice consumption . The establish PLS-DA ( Partial least square discriminant analysis ) /OPLS-DA ( Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis ) model provide opportunity identify cranberry juice consumer . It unknown whether cranberry juice consumption influence gut microbiota profile human . But several study suggest polyphenol-rich diet improves gut microbiota profile . The previous vitro study human gut microbiota indicate microbial catabolism A-type cranberry procyanidins produce metabolite different profile structure compare B-type procyanidins . Understanding microbiome change human gut enable investigator correlate explain metabolome change urine blood , also explain health benefit cranberry . With sample collect study , metabolomics change short-term cranberry juice treatment ( 3days ) long-term treatment ( 21days ) compare . Since urinary tract protection effect cranberry juice often associate chronic consumption , metabolomic change expect identified long-term study . Research Plan : Specific aim 1 : Twenty ( 20 ) healthy female college student age 18-29 normal BMI ( Body mass index ) ( 18.5-25 ) least 110 pound weight recruit UF ( University Florida ) campus . Advertisement form flyer . Contact information investigator include flyer . Questionnaire use obtain information subject prescreen . All participant receive write oral information regard natural potential risk study . Participants advise avoid proanthocyanidins-rich food include cranberry , blueberry , strawberry plum , raspberry , apple , grape , grape seed extract , pycnogenol , red wine , tea , chocolate cocoa product cranberry base supplement begin 10-day ( 1st-9th ) run period end study . Participants suggest consume orange , watermelon , honey dew , cantaloupe replacement . Urine stool sample collection kit distribute participant participant train use collection kit . One fecal sample collect participant day 7th 9th day . On 10th day morning , overnight fast urine sample self-collected subject blood sample drawn ( 2 tube , 30mL total ) . Breakfast provide participant fast blood sample collection . A trained certified phlebotomist hire draw blood . After blood drawn , participant consume 1 bottle ( 250mL ) cranberry placebo juice another 5 bottle cranberry placebo juice give subject consume even 10th day morning even 11th and12th day . One fecal sample also collect 12th- 4th day . All subject return clinical unit morning 13th day self-collected overnight fast urine sample blood sample collect 30-60min participant consume 1 bottle cranberry placebo juice . Cranberry placebo juice distribute subject consume even 13th day morning even 14th- 29th day . Appointment schedule weekly upon request participant 14th 29th day . One fecal sample collect 29th 31st day . In morning 30th day , overnight fast urine sample self-collected subject blood sample drawn consume cranberry juice placebo . After 14-days washout period , participant switch alternative regimen repeat protocol . All sample collect aliquoted keep -80°C . It 's unlikely happen , subject serious adverse effect juice consumption , participant remove study depend situation safety concern . Preparation urine plasma sample collect the13th , 48th day ( 3 day later cranberry juice/placebo consumption ) follow establish protocol . LC-HRMS ( Liquid chromatography - High-resolution mass spectrometry ) data normalize import SIMCA ( Version 13.0.3 , Umetrics , Umea , Sweden ) use previously establish PLS-DA ( Partial least square discriminant analysis ) /OPLS-DA ( Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis ) model blindly identify cranberry juice consumer . Results send Ocean Spray verification . Specific aim 2 : The baseline fecal sample fecal sample collect around 30th , 65th day ( 21 day later cranberry juice/placebo consumption ) analyze microbiome composition . Genomic microbial DNA extract stool sample use MoBlo Power soil DNA isolation kits.. Microbiota change gut correlate metabolome change urine use redundancy discriminant analysis . Fecal mucin IgA ( Immunoglobulin A , indicator intestinal barrier ) , short chain fatty acid ammonia stool sample analyze use specific assay kit HPLC ( High-performance liquid chromatography ) method . Specific aim 3 : Preparation urine plasma sample collect 30th , 65th day ( 21 day later cranberry juice/placebo consumption ) follow establish protocol . UHPLC ( Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography ) -Q-Orbitrap-HRMS ( High-resolution mass spectrometry ) analyse , Multivariate data process statistical analysis experiment process discuss Specific aim 2 .</detailed_description>
