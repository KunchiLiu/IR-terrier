	<brief_title>Blood Ropivacaine Concentrations Following Nerve Block Infants Toddlers Undergoing Esophageal Atresia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-surgical pain management often suboptimal pediatric patient , especially complex past medical past surgical history . Physicians generally , physician Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) , particular , employ regional anesthetic technique either primary adjunct measure perioperative pain control . One benefit regional anesthesia avoidance , least limitation , opioid benzodiazepine exposure . Continuous paravertebral nerve blockade ( CPVNB ) regional anesthesia technique use indwell catheter , place ultrasound guidance , terminate paravertebral space . Introduction local anesthetic catheter produce ipsilateral somatic sympathetic nerve blockade multiple contiguous dermatome . The technique provide effective analgesia unilateral thoracic abdominal surgical procedure . CPVNB use ropivacaine use regularly institution patient age part various multimodal intra- post-operative pain management strategy . The success CPVNB implementation infant toddler undergo esophageal atresia mark technique become essentially de facto standard care population BCH . Unfortunately , even today , study demonstrate pharmacokinetic profile ropivacaine CPVNB infants toddler available . A study examine plasma level ropivacaine single injection paravertebral nerve block adult patient . For example , single bolus injection 2mg/kg well tolerate , exceed peak plasma concentration 2.5 Âµg/ml , well concentration consider threshold ropivacaine local anesthetic systemic toxicity ( LAST ) . However , unclear applicable data complex pediatric surgical patient BCH . In order fully understand plasma ropivacaine concentration CPVNB , particularly concentration relate know threshold ropivacaine-induced systemic local anesthetic toxicity , investigator plan measure plasma concentration ropivacaine various time point follow initiation CPVNB infant toddler patient undergone esophageal atresia repair posterior tracheopexy . This study aim alter current standard clinical care receive participant . No additional treatment provide part study . Continuous ropivacaine infusion via paravertebral nerve block catheter , standard practice surgical population investigator ' institution , administer enrol ( non-enrolled ) patient undergo esophageal atresia repair posterior tracheopexy . Paravertebral ropivacaine infusion direct BCH Pain Treatment Service , use exist dosage management protocol . The investigator ' goal well understand plasma ropivacaine level continuous infusion relate currently understood threshold induce systemic local anesthetic toxicity infant toddler , develop evidence-based safety guideline ropivacaine infusion infant toddler undergo CPVNB . The investigator expect describe pharmacokinetics ropivacaine via CPVNB postoperative pain management infant toddler follow esophageal atresia repair . Knowledge systemic absorption ropivacaine deliver CPVNB may provide new insight appropriate dose order prevent LAST . This particular interest subgroup infant rate metabolism elimination local anesthetic drug poorly understood .</detailed_description>
