	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating TAS-102 Plus Nivolumab Patients With MSS CRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , single arm , safety lead-in , Phase 2 study , use Simon 's 2 stage design evaluate safety efficacy TAS-102 plus nivolumab patient Microsatellite-stable refractory metastatic colorectal cancer Stage 1 : Patients enrol Cycle 1 treatment , evaluate safety tolerability combination therapy . Assuming tolerate dose confirm additional patient evaluable response enrol follow minimum 6 month interim analysis ass safety efficacy determine whether second stage open enrollment . Stage 2 : Additional patient evaluable response assessment enrol follow minimum 6 month .</detailed_description>
