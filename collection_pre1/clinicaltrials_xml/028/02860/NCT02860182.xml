	<brief_summary>Acute type A aortic dissection frequent ( 3 case per 100 000 people per year ) severe ( spontaneous mortality 70 % ) , need emergency surgical treatment . Surgical outcome improve development surgical technique , postoperative mortality remain high ( 15-30 % 30 day ) . Endovascular approach deployment endoprosthesis seal proximal intimal tear attractive minimally invasive technique , represent alternative surgical repair especially high risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Characterization Ascending Aorta Patients With Without Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : study aim characterize mechanical property ascend aorta ( AA ) patient , without aortic dissection . Materials method : comprise vivo ex vivo study perform 2 group patient : ( 1 ) patient admit acute type A dissection treat surgical procedure ; ( 2 ) healthy control group select among patient without ascend aorta pathology underwent transoesophageal echocardiography various indication . In vivo study : Strain , distensibility , stiffness index pressure strain elastic modulus ( Ep ) calculate aortic diameter variation response pressure variation . Aortic diameter measure use transoesophageal echocardiography . Ex vivo study : biaxial tensile test perform aortic wall sample . Dissected aortic sample collect patient underwent surgical repair healthy sample unused donor hearts lung . Mechanical characterization combine histological microstructural analysis aortic wall . The latter conduct use multiphoton microscopy visualize elastin collagen fiber . Results : In vivo study : 22 patient healthy control group 13 patient dissection group prospectively investigate . In vitro study : Biaxial testing perform 4 sample dissect aorta 6 sample non dissect aorta . Anisotropic non linear behavior aortic tissue show 2 type sample . Dissected tissue stiffer intimal flap turn stiffer non dissect tissue . Histological data show dissection group global elastin density low control . Microstructural analysis dissection specimen reveal high collagen signal medium mainly circumferential plane , contrast roughly similar intensity two plane control . This high signal reflect high collagen fiber density and/or thicker fiber tunica . Conclusion : Both vivo vitro data reveal dissected aorta stiffer healthy ascend aorta . These finding consequence choice futur device dedicate AA</detailed_description>
