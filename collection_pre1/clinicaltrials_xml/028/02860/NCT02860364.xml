	<brief_summary>Hypothermic circulatory arrest important surgical technique , allow complex aortic surgery perform safely . Hypothermic circulatory arrest provide protection cerebral visceral organ , may result long cardiopulmonary bypass time surgery , increased risk bleed , inflammation , neuronal injury . To manage consequence , trend towards warmer core body temperatures circulatory arrest emerge . This trial randomize patient either mild ( 32°C ) moderate ( 26°C ) hypothermia aortic hemiarch surgery determine mild hypothermia reduces length cardiopulmonary bypass time key measure morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
