	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle dysfunction common patient COPD recognize contribute factor reduce exercise capacity , health relate quality life increase mortality associate disease . Several structural change limb muscle patient previously report link known reduction muscle strength endurance commonly report COPD . Muscle dysfunction , low extremity muscle strength , muscle fatigue also contribute intensity dyspnea ability sustain exercise mostly stimulation type III IV muscle afferent . As , many patient primarily perform aerobic exercise training part pulmonary rehabilitation unable tolerate intensity and/or volume exercise require achieve clinically important change exercise capacity symptom relief . Resistance training ( RT ) attractive exercise modality patient COPD efficacious often tolerable initially . To knowledge one examine whether similar benefit elicit long RT program attain 4 week use multi-joint , multi-muscle exercise individualized progression . If short term RT program improve muscle quality , enhance endurance , reduce type III IV afferent activity would reduce drive breathe thus dyspnea . These adaptation would likely translate improve exercise tolerance making feasible `` pre-habilitate '' COPD patient tolerable RT , allow achieve high volume/intensity endurance training , thus make pulmonary rehabilitation effective .</detailed_description>
