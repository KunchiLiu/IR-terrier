	<brief_title>CPC-201 Alzheimer 's Disease Type Dementia : PET Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients continue 10 mg/day dose donepezil addition 15 mg/day solifenacin least week , donepezil titrate 10 50 mg/day ( maximum allow dose ; MAD ) patient 's MTD increments 5 10 mg weekly bi-weekly medically appropriate . When MTD MAD donepezil co-administered solifenacin 15 mg/day CPC-201 reach , treatment stably maintain , tolerate , 3 month . Patients successfully complete protocol option continue open extension CPC-201 treatment ( separate protocol ) return pre-admission therapeutic regimen discharge study . On day study drug dose increase , patient evaluate clinic out-patient . This sequential study conduct 6 phase AD patient previously receive donepezil dose 10 mg/day : 1 . Screening 2 . Baseline assessment 3 . Solifenacin introduction dose 15 mg/day ( give continue donepezil 10 mg/day CPC-201 ) ; 4 . Donepezil dose escalation subject 's MTD 50 mg/day ( MAD ) , give combination solifenacin 15 mg/day CPC-201 ; 5 . Donepezil maintenance MTD ( MAD ) combine solifenacin 15 mg/day CPC-201 3 month ; 6 . Protocol exit ( resumption pre-study treatment regimen successful completion one month post-study safety check ) optional entry 6 month extension phase . Baseline assessment ( solifenacin introduction ) : Upon successful completion screen evaluation entry study , participant continue receive 10 mg donepezil receive neuropsychological evaluation clinic together 11C-PMP PET scan associate MRI study brain accordance University Michigan . Solifenacin introduction : After one week baseline assessment period , solifenacin treatment initiate 15 mg/day least one week patient continue receive donepezil dose 10 mg/day . Those tolerate solifenacin withdraw study replace . Donepezil escalation : During phase , continue receive 15 mg/day solifenacin , dose donepezil gradually increase weekly bi-weekly increment 5 10 mg tolerate . The dose donepezil increase first intolerable dose ( FID ) reach dose 50 mg/day attain , whichever come first . Once patient reach FID , MTD define immediately precede , tolerate dose . During dose titration , investigator may extend donepezil dose additional day temporarily ( permanently ) reduce medically indicate . On day donepezil dose increase , patient remain clinic least 5 hour study drug administration sign symptom medically significant adverse effect abate . Donepezil dose maintenance : During phase , patient continue treatment donepezil ( MTD ) solifenacin ( 15 mg/day ) 3 month ( ± 2 week ) . All follow weekly telephone interview monthly clinic visit assess safety tolerability . If intolerable adverse event ( AEs ) develop , daily dose donepezil down-titrated , patient continue treatment new MTD additional 2 week completion maintenance phase , whichever come last . Patients continue experience intolerable AEs several down-titrations withdrawn study . End study test end donepezil dose maintenance : After completion 3-months ( ± 2 week ) treatment donepezil ( MTD ) solifenacin ( 15 mg/day ) , study participant receive repeat clinical examination , routine laboratory safety test PET associate study . Patients successfully complete protocol option continue open extension CPC-201 treatment ( separate protocol ) return pre-admission therapeutic regimen discharge study . Study Exit : Upon termination study , subject return original daily donepezil dose . Investigator decide whether patient discontinue high dose donepezil without down-titration , whether donepezil down-titrated prestudy donepezil dose . Whatever decision , patient ordinarily treat least additional 7 day solifenacin 15 mg/day .</detailed_description>
