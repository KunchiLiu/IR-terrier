	<brief_title>The Prognostic Capabilities Of A Preoperative Six-Minute Walk Test To Independently Inform Cardiovascular Risk After Major Noncardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study investigator propose undertake prospective cohort study preoperative clinic Royal-Victoria Montreal General Hospitals McGill University Health Centre . All patient plan noncardiac surgery general regional anesthesia consider inclusion . Eligible consent patient undergo 6MWT preoperative clinical visit , typically occur within week surgery . This test perform trained health care worker . Patients walk back forth along 20 corridor , attempt cover much ground possible 6 minute . Patients allow rest chair perform test necessary . Patients encourage resume walk soon patient feel physically able . The total cover distance 6 minute measure near meter . The RCRI score calculate study participant .</detailed_description>
