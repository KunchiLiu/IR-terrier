	<brief_summary>Background : Dietary intake vitamin D include vitamin D3 ( VitD3 ) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 25OHD3 ) vitamin D2 ( VitD2 ) . However , bioactivity different specie currently scientifically establish . Objective : The aim study test hypothesis VitD3 , 25OHD3 VitD2 affect vitamin D status equally human reject , estimate difference activity . Design : This study design 3 x 6 week ( 4 week run-in ) double-blinded randomize cross-over study 12 young , apparently healthy male volunteer perform wintertime 55 degree N. 4 week run-in period volunteer receive 10 ug/d VitD3 order achieve steady-state vitamin D status . During 3x6 week intervention period subject receive 10 ug/d VitD3 , 10 ug/d 25OHD3 10 ug/d VitD2 random order . Content vitD3 , VitD2 , 25OHD3 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 ( 25OHD2 ) serum quantify LC-MS/MS use 0.1 mL serum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 12 apparently healthy , free live male adult age 20-30 year recruit 3x6 week vitamin D intervention trial . Subjects recruit among student University Copenhagen use advertisement place around University Copenhagen . Volunteers exclude BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2 , donate blood within last three month , chronic disease , use medication regularly , hypercalcemic , excessive alcohol use , know malabsorption syndrome use medication know interfere vitamin D metabolism . Furthermore , decrease sun exposure , volunteer plan go ski travel south study exclude . All subject Caucasian , low habitual fish intake ( less twice week ) non-smokers . All subject instruct maintain level physical activity throughout study agree refrain donate blood , well take kind vitamin , mineral dietary supplement supplement provide study . All subject also agree abstain take solarium intervention . The study approve The Local Research Ethics Committee Copenhagen Frederiksberg . All participant give write consent accordance Helsinki declaration . Design conduct study The present study design double blind randomise cross trial adult male assign receive tablet contain 10 µg vitD3 , 10 µg 25OHD3 10 µg vitD2 random order . Prior intervention subject receive 10 µg vitD3 4 week order achieve steady state vitamin D status . The vitamin D tablet ( Jette ) Compliance assess tablet counting . The study carry Copenhagen , Denmark ( latitude 55 degree N ) . All subject recruit September run-in period start mid-October study finish end March . During study subject examine screen , day 1 , 22 day 42 . Blood sample collect 5 time ; run-in , baseline , end period , 1 , 2 3 , respectively . Blood sample draw 12 h fasting , morning ( 0800 0900 ) train medical laboratory technician . Subjects inform drink kind alcohol abstain hard physical work 24 h blood sample . They , however , allow drink ½ L water . Blood collect venipuncture 10 ml dry tube analysis serum vitamin D , 5 ml tube analysis serum PTH 7 ml Trace element free tube analysis calcium . Blood sample keep 20 degree C centrifuge 40 min 3000 g 15 min . serum transfer plastic tube store -80 degree C vitamin analysis -20 degree C Ca PTH . Anthropometric measure , include height weight , take baseline . Body weight measure near 0.1 kg use electronic decimal weight . Subjects ask empty bladder measure weight wear underwear . The height measure near cm subject stand without shoe , gather feed head look forward horizontal plan . Habitual intake calcium vitamin D estimate use validated food-frequency questionnaire . A health lifestyle questionnaire , assess habitual fish intake , physical activity , general health , smoke status alcohol consumption , complete screening . Laboratory analysis Serum 25OHD Serum intact parathyroid hormone Serum total calcium</detailed_description>
