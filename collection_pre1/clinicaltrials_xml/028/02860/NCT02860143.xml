	<brief_summary>A . Determine Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) use procedural sedation adequately monitor patient 's respiratory status compare capnograph Aims B . Compare time capture respiratory event ( depression , arrest , etc… ) RVM capnograph C. Compare incidence miss poor quality reading RVM capnograph D. Compare RR reading RVM capnograph ( period adequate data quality device ) E. If RMV identify respiratory obstruction . Capnography</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Ventilation Using Respiratory Volume Monitor Compared Capnography During Intravenous Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Proposed Research : Continuous respiratory monitoring use ExSpiron System particularly beneficial patient receive intravenous propofol breathe spontaneously natural airway . Assessment management respiratory function early intervention indicate multifaceted , complex task often complicate unavailability cohesive continuous monitoring system guide clinical decision . The ExSpiron system design patient intend address limitation current generation hospital monitor provide healthcare provider continuous real-time data regard patient 's respiratory status . Recent RVM data show stratification patient base MV % predict , prior opioid dose make possible identify patient risk decrease MV opioid-induced respiratory depression ( OIRD ) . 1 . In spontaneously breathe , non-ventilated patient , current monitoring device provide continuous , objective non-invasive , continuous real time information important respiratory parameter TV , MV RR . 2 . Current monitoring non-intubated patient mostly rely oximetry data , subjective clinical assessment occasionally EtCO2 measurement . In appropriate clinical setting , ExSpiron system provide direct quantitative measure ventilation parameter use clinical assessment trend prediction well response medication intervention .</detailed_description>
