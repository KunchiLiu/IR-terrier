	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well alisertib without fulvestrant work treat patient endocrine-resistant breast cancer spread place body . Alisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell reduce amount estrogen make body . Giving alisertib without fulvestrant may better treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib With Without Fulvestrant Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic , Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact objective tumor response rate ( use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) addition fulvestrant alisertib woman endocrine resistant , advanced estrogen receptor positive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile treatment regimen . II . To assess impact median progression-free survival addition fulvestrant alisertib . III . To obtain estimated tumor response rate median progression-free survival time alisertib fulvestrant treatment cohort patient progress alisertib monotherapy , crossover receive combination alisertib fulvestrant . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change aurora A kinase , SMAD5 SOX2 expression phosphorylation tumor tissue first cycle assign treatment . II . To assess change estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression function tumor tissue first cycle assign treatment . III . To generate patient derive xenograft ( PDX ) tumor collect baseline progression disease ( PD ) order identify mechanism associate de novo acquire alisertib resistance . IV . After first cycle treatment , ass change aurora A kinase , phosphorylated ( p ) ~SOX2 ER expression circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , assess concordance change expression tumor tissue CTCs . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression , may cross-over Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) 1-2 minute day 1 15 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive alisertib PO BID day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
