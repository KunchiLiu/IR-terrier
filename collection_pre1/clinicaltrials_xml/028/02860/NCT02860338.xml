	<brief_summary>This retrospective study extensive , confirmatory analysis cognitive functional outcome initially see 2 group MCI/dementia patient Springfield , MA compare specialize dementia care comprehensive treatment approach versus usual care deliver non-specialist setting . The first group patient ( n= 328 ) see dementia specialist , utilized standardized assessment treatment protocol ( CNS ) . This include comprehensive identification treatment hypoxia , sleep-disorders , cognitively-impairing metabolic condition well maximally- dose FDA-approved medication dementia , depression , PBA . The second group patient ( n= 280 ) see non-dementia specialist community receive usual care include comprehensive assessment treatment underlie metabolic derangement maximal utilization currently available medication . This study , evaluate date large cohort ( n &gt; 800 ) specialist-treated cognitively-impaired patient , examine hypothesis comprehensive dementia treatment protocol yield cognitive stabilization and/or improvement use already available dementia drug compare usual community care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MCI DEMENTIA TREATMENTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED DEMENTIA PRACTICE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From 2008-2013 5,000 patient see community-based internist/psychiatrist specialize treat cognitively impaired adult suffer MCI dementia due Alzheimer 's Disease , vascular dementia , combine DAT/VAD , FTD , PD , LBD , well dementia due traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , alcoholism autoimmune disease . Cohort 1 include patient specialist practice extensively evaluate standardized protocol assessment aim identify reversible treatable condition adversely affect cognition , achieve maximum diagnostic accuracy respect underlie dementia pathology . The protocol include physical mental status examination , neuroimaging ( PET scan and/or MRI 's volumetrics ) , lab test , overnight pulse oximetry , in-lab ambulatory polysomnography , gold standard neuropsychological test well rapid , in-office cognitive testing . The comprehensive treatment protocol attempt correction modifiable metabolic derangement , utilized maximally tolerated FDA approve medication device . Cohort 2 include patient refer primary care clinicians non-dementia specialist neuropsychology practice standardize cognitive evaluation part usual care , treat dementia specialist . This in-depth retrospective analysis first attempt evaluate comparative effectiveness dementia drug treatment intervention cognitively impaired patient group whose baseline metabolic abnormality identify , treat maintain optimally throughout course care versus patient group intensively assess manage . Outcome measure include objective cognitive test functional behavioral assessment correlate prescribed standard dementia medication , reduction benzodiazepine , narcotic antipsychotic use , well baseline interval measure oxygenation adequacy , BNP , CRP , IGF-1 , homocysteine , methylmalonic acid , iron status , Vitamin D 25-OH , utilization oxygen positive airway pressure treatment .</detailed_description>
