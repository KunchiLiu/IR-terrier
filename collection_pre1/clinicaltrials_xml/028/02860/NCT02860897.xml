	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : To evaluate patient adherence cream versus tablet base local estrogen therapy randomize treatment modality determine difference adherence either form . HYPOTHESIS : There difference adherence cream versus tablet base local estrogen therapy prescribe 6 week course postoperative therapy female pelvic reconstructive surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Adherence Premarin Versus Vagifem Therapy After Female Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genitourinary syndrome consequence lack estrogen exposure genitourinary tract menopause . The result hypoestrogenic state thinning , shrink , increase vaginal friction , increase low urinary tract symptom . It estimate 60 % postmenopausal woman experience symptom widely accept treatment genitourinary syndrome application local estrogen . Estrogen widely prescribe beneficial adjunct treatment menopausal genitourinary syndrome use decrease incidence urgency , frequency , nocturia , stress urinary incontinence , urge urinary incontinence , recurrent urinary tract infection . Despite well describe use local estrogen therapy genitourinary syndrome , form vaginal estrogen create equally patient adherence prescription uniform among different formulation . Shulman colleague note used genitourinary syndrome , patient prescribe local estrogen tablet demonstrate significantly long compliance therapy prescribe estrogen cream ( 149 day vs. 92 day ) . Similarly , cohort 30,000 patient , Portman demonstrate patient prescribed vaginal estrogen tablet also likely adherent therapy give cream formulation . Some reason early discontinuation local vaginal cream due messiness application , leakage , concern underdosing overdosing , cream generally unpleasant . Given extensive use local estrogen genitourinary syndrome , despite limited data , surgeon prescribe local estrogen prevent development postoperative complication like low urinary tract symptom female pelvic reconstructive surgery . In postoperative 12 week follow , Karp colleague note administration vaginal estrogen tablet postmenopausal woman associate improved vaginal maturation index objective atrophy assessment vaginal reconstructive surgery . Vaccaro also note preoperative administration vaginal estrogen administer 2- 12 week reconstructive surgery improve vaginal maturation index 15.5 % may improve tissue substrate suture placement . There two study evaluate effect vaginal estrogen midureteral sling placement : Zullo study retropubic midureteral sling note patient receive vaginal estrogen tablet exhibit high incidence urinary urgency patient ( 4 % vs. 29 % ) . Liapias evaluate local estrogen application 6 month transobturator tape sling note statistically significant decrease urinary frequently urgency . Given data , appear role postoperative local estrogen therapy pelvic reconstructive surgery clear patient adherent therapy form therapy : cream tablet . To best investigator knowledge , data describes patient adherence local estrogen therapy female pelvic surgery . Therefore , purpose study evaluate patient adherence cream versus tablet base local estrogen therapy randomize treatment modality determine difference adherence either form .</detailed_description>
