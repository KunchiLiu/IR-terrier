	<brief_title>A Trial Dextromethorphan Treatment Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study double-blind , placebo-controlled , fixed-dose randomized clinical trial evaluate effect oral Dextromethorphan psychiatric inpatient hospitalize Major Depressive Disorder self examiner rat inventory depression . The primary outcome measure change depression symptom measure examiner-rated Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Secondary outcome measure depression/anxiety/mood index measure subject examiner-rated inventory include Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI ) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , Clinical Global Impressions Scale ( CGI ) . These additional scale use comprehensively capture effect mood thought process may miss under-represented use few metric . The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale choose primary tool measurement depression study originally design use trained clinician rating depression severity inpatient setting , match context propose research environment . In order minimize bias , research personnel complete subject assessment take place Day 1 2 study , follow-up visit blind give assessment day involve completion examiner-rated scale ( MADRS , CGI ) . Dr. Brueckner ( PI ) Dr. Tolliver ( co-PI ) clinicians perform screen , initial phase , follow-up assessment course study . Blinding maintain Investigational Drug Service Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) . Dosing Dextromethorphan deliver two 75mg dos separate 4 hour . Because preliminary research involve use Dextromethorphan intend study population , choice total combine dose 150mg dosage represent best-estimate extrapolation achieve adequate pharmacologic effect , maintain subject safety . In study dextromethorphan use investigate analgesic property subject Fibromyalgia , statistically significant pain reduction achieve dose 90mg , 60mg . Pain reduction likely mediate effect Dextromethorphan primary metabolite Dextrophan N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . Adequate bind receptor specifically seek study , NMDA-receptor antagonism also mechanism theorize impart potential rapid act antidepressant ( although sigma receptor binding may significantly important well ) . Therefore , assume dose least 90mg need achieve measurable NMDA-receptor activity , therefore antidepressant response . Although certain concomitant medication regimen allow course trial outline detail inclusion/exclusion criterion , note subject certain antidepressant medication like Sertraline , Venlafaxine , Escitalopram , Bupropion ( name ) allow participate trial . As discussed far , follow section protocol , study involve use Dextromethorphan neurological psychiatric purpose largely use Dextromethorphan combine Quinidine , available FDA-approved treatment Pseudobulbar Affect medication call Nuedexta . The Quinidine component inhibits metabolism Dextromethorphan , increase duration effect , Dextromethorphan plasma level , reduce formation active metabolite Dextrophan . The decision make use dextromethorphan alone study several reason . The first reason avoid introduce undue cardiovascular risk study participant . Quinidine antiarrhythmic drug prolong QT interval ( although effect usually minimal dos use achieve inhibition Dextromethorphan metabolism ) . Given many psychiatric medication prolong QT interval , felt would safer use Quinidine component along Dextromethorphan . Secondly , felt prudent ensure pharmacologic action Dextromethorphan unduly extend ( metabolism inhibition ) protect development protract side-effects . Additionally , actually primary metabolite Dextromethorphan , Dextrophan , robust NMDA receptor antagonist property . Because action receptor specifically seek due presume antidepressant property , development metabolite desire , would truncate use Quinidine inhibitor Dextromethorphan metabolism ( additional detail Dextromethorphan metabolism , related consideration , see subsequent section ) . When subject undergone screening outline procedural documentation herein enrol study , give Dextromethorphan placebo two dos . In study , investigator use Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Monohydrate powder supply MUSC Investigational Drug Service compound single-capsule preparation dextrose filler . The placebo also provide MUSC Investigational Drug Service consist dextrose single-capsule preparation . Dextromethorphan placebo administer time 8 ounce water . The 75mg dose Dextromethorphan placebo administer twice , second dose occurrence take place 4 hour first . In event study subject experience serious adverse event initial dose , felt risk adverse outcome base response initial dose , eligible receive second dose , remove study . Additionally , study subject want receive second dose 4 hour mark , request oblige . In case occurs , remainder assessment occur normal , receive second dose . There requirement regard food intake lack thereof study drug administration either dose occasion . Because effect 75mg dose Dextromethorphan may subjectively detectable , subject blinding may compromise due presence interoceptive cue . To detect presence potential issue , subject participate study ask treatment group believe assign . Depression , anxiety , mood metric obtain 1 hour dose study drug placebo , hour 2-4 initial dosing , hour 6-8 hour ( 2-4 hour second dose administer 4 hour mark ) , follow day , 24-36 hour initial dose . In order ensure subject participate study intensive follow-up , require engage follow-up visit take place Thursday Friday follow initial phase study , inpatient outpatient basis depend whether study subject discharge hospital . The standardized mood assessment also obtain follow-up visit . During described encounter , adverse event record , necessary additional care render . The timing , design , layout study part extrapolate similar study use single-dose intranasal ketamine treat depression . The timing measurement adjust ( compare reference study ) accommodate pharmacokinetics Dextromethorphan , enhance study feasibility propose inpatient setting , allow 2 dos administer enhance drug exposure . For example , first encounter subject take place 2-4 hour post-dosing ( 6-8 hour , 2-4 post second dosing ) , peak plasma level Dextromethorphan usually achieve time . In addition mood metric obtain encounter , Day 1/Hour -1 , Day 1 /Hour 2-4 , Day 1/Hour 4 , Day 1 /Hour 6-8 , Day 2 /Hour 24-36 subject undergo physical neurological assessment monitor evidence untoward medication effect beyond adverse event elicit verbal exchange study subject , base initial assessment gather prior study drug administration ( Day 1/Hour -1 ) . This assessment describe . In line prior research involve use medication dissociative property , Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale administer effort capture dissociative sign symptom exhibit experienced study subject .</detailed_description>
