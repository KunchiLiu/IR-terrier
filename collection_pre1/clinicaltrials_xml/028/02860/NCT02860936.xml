	<brief_title>Lenvatinib Recurrent and/or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinomas Salivary Glands : ACC-LEN14</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinomas salivary gland ( SGCs ) rare , ( less 1 % cancer head neck include 20 malignant histotypes . They occur major minor salivary gland , locally aggressive , demonstrate invasiveness lead involvement facial nerve , skin , bone surround soft tissue . The standard treatment surgical excision , follow radiotherapy select case high-grade histotypes , advance disease neck node diffusion . Loco-regional recurrence occur 16 % 85 % , manage select case surgery and/or radiotherapy , although prognosis patient remain poor . Adenoid cystic cancer ( ACC ) common SGC histotype observe metastatic subject ( 60 % ) distant metastases principal cause failure , diagnose 25-55 % patient . First-line treatment palliative chemotherapy typically associate benefit neither response rate outcome . In preclinical model , VEGF seem contribute tumor aggressiveness well distant metastasization , particular ACC . Moreover , 80 % ACC characterize MYB-NFIB fusion gene . Deregulation MYB involve several gene include associated apoptosis , cell cycle control angiogenesis . Clinical evidence support use antiangiogenic compound ACC . Sorafenib multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( VEGFR1-3 ; PDGFR , RET , cKIT FLT3 ) axitinib potent TKI anti VEGFR1-3 test advanced ACC , obtain 1 % response rate , suggest activity agent class drug . Recently two whole genome sequence ACC tumor/normal pair find mutation gene involve FGF/IGF/PI3K pathway ( 30 % case ) corroborate hypothesis subset might benefit agent target pathway . Dovitinib , small molecule inhibits FGFR , currently investigation . Preliminary result indicate drug produce objective partial response prolong tumor stabilization patient progressive ACCs . Lenvatinib strong antiangiogenic effect compare sorafenib axitinib also high potency regard inhibition FGFR-1 , offer potential opportunity block one well know mechanism resistance VEGF/VEGFR inhibitor . Lenvatinib also direct oncogenic effect control tumor cell proliferation inhibit RET , c-KIT , PDGFR beta , well effect tumor microenvironment block FGFR PDGFR beta . Lenvatinib investigate thyroid cancer hepatocellular carcinoma ( phase III trial ) malignancy , show high rate activity . Based preclinical clinical data , investigator believe target angiogenesis , FGFR pathway tumor microenvironment might represent rational basis test lenvatinib patient relapse and/or metastatic ACC .</detailed_description>
