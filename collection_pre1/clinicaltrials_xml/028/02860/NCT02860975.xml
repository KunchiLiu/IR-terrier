	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint research study prove safety healthy subject breathe humidify hypoxic inspiratory gas mixture 5 day . The secondary endpoint study describe physiological biochemical change 5-day hypoxic period 2 day return normoxia . The specific aim follow : AIM 1 : To provide safe , control set prolonged exposure monitor healthy adult normobaric , low-oxygen environment five day . AIM 2 : To carry seven-days long pilot safety-study twelve healthy young subject induce hypoxia humidify normobaric gas mixture contain oxygen ( O2 ) content low 11 % reach peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 80 % -85 % . Screening consist physical examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram , cardiac echocardiography , sickle cell screen test , current ( within 12 week clearance exam intervene medical treatment ) routine blood urine analysis . Women use oral , subdermal injectable contraceptive , use mean birth control may participate . A urine pregnancy test conduct part screen process study participation 7 day start study repeat day enrollment . The test result read female staff member keep result confidential . If woman decline pregnancy test , able participate . Recruitment do three way : 1 . Broadcast MGH : Research Studies In Need Volunteers 2 .

The investigator access personal Medical Information ( PMI ) study purpose . There randomization interventional physiological study . All patient receive procedure order . Biostatistical analysis : A de-identified code assign patient register dedicated enrollment log . The baseline study volunteer data ( vital sign biochemical measurement ) collect MGH electronic medical chart ( EPIC ) . Prospective collection patient data include specific data sheet . Data express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) median/interquartile range ( IQR ) appropriate . Sample size : research-project aim study 12 healthy subject entire 7-day study period . To account possible dropout miss data , 18 healthy volunteer enrol . Sample size calculation : This intra-hospital safety trial purpose test method re-create safe hypoxic environment possible future study patient mitochondrial dysfunction . While 2 3 subject would likely sufficient test method reliably delivery humidify nitrogen ( N2 ) ( O2 ) predetermine concentration , method test 12 healthy subject reproduce method obtain feedback volunteer . To account possible dropout , 18 healthy volunteer enrol . Risk discomforts 1 . Complications surgical non-surgical procedure , etc . Participants study undergo 3 procedure study : hypoxic gas administration , phlebotomy , echocardiography . - Facemask . 1 . Claustrophobia one exclusion criterion . If subject develop claustrophobia , he/she may leave trial point . 2 . The common side effect facemask pressure relate , redness , irritation mask 's border . To decrease possible skin irritation abrasion , subject use tent night high flow nasal cannula day breakfast , lunch dinner . Additionally able choose whether use high-flow nasal cannula facemask day time alternative facemask . - Tent . Risks associate use tent include unintended hypoxia , hypercarbia , claustrophobia . These tent make MGH shop routinely use burn unit maintain elevated temperature ( 80-90 °F ) humidification critically ill patient . Our subject continuously monitor hypoxia clinical condition limit risk unintended hypoxia hypercarbia . Claustrophobia handle describe previously . - Nasal cannula non-invasive high flow humidify gas . All participant wear non-invasive high flow humidify gas part study period . Unlike mask , high flow nasal cannula well tolerated hospitalize patient warm humidify air alleviates discomfort high flow . In order avoid abrasion , inspect subject ' nasal mucosa morning evening . - Intravenous ( IV ) puncture phlebotomy . Risks related phlebotomy include bruising , hematoma formation , cellulitis , superficial thrombosis , bleed phlebitis . An IV nurse anesthesiologist perform phlebotomy minimize subject discomfort . - Trans-thoracic echocardiography . Echocardiography perform daily basis : Echocardiographic assessment pulmonary artery pressure cardiac output noninvasive painless maneuver . It commonly use clinical practice , use field hypoxic condition , safe study subject . If echocardiographic study reveals unexpected cardiac disease subject inform also primary care physician ( PCP ) inform . If subject PCP , provide information choose PCP . In presence abnormal physical exam and/or additional abnormal laboratory result ( include positive pregnancy test ) , subject inform . 2 . Drug side effect toxicities A gas mixture enrich nitrogen test . It expect subject may suffer certain degree acute mountain sickness . Symptoms may include : headache , dizziness , poor sleep , poor appetite fatigue relate hypoxia . These symptom well describe mountain climber require interruption study , unless subject request exit study . Furthermore , propose model normobaric hypoxia , risk acute mountain sickness symptom report low hypobaric hypoxia ( simulated altitude ) . The following risk might also occur : - Risks Associated Hypoxia : Severe hypoxemia ( SpO2 ≤ 70 % ) , especially decreased respiratory rate ensue . Since fraction inspire oxygen quickly increase , risk develop prolonged hypoxia event . If SpO2 ≤ 70 % decrease one continuous minute , nitrogen administration stop fraction inspire oxygen increase 50 % . The study stop . Symptoms hypoxia ( light headedness , dizziness ) typically resolve immediately upon return normal range SpO2 . If hypoxia symptom present , subject exit study symptoms light-headedness dizziness resolve , headache nausea absent . - Acute mountain sickness rarely progress high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) high altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) would case reportable either occur normobaria limited hypoxic challenge employ . Though HAPE unlikely occur , provide daily monitoring echocardiography , clinical exam ( auscultation rales unusual dyspnea rest solicit ) , pulse oximetry . If HAPE occur , study stop subject treat oxygen resolution symptom . - HACE also unlikely potential risk study . If subject develop evidence ataxia alter mental status , immediately withdrawn study . FiO2 increase 50 % , dexamethasone 8 mg IV administer , head compute tomography ( CT ) perform rule much common source ( e.g . spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage ) complaint . If CT abnormality note , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) obtain assess cerebral edema characteristic T2 weight signal change corpus callosum consistent HAPE.. Any study subject experience side effect sufficient prompt premature termination study allow continue protocol . He monitor vital sign normalize transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) show normal right heart function . 3 . Device complications/malfunctions Nitrogen generator : If nitrogen generator malfunctioning , air enrich nitrogen nitrogen-tanks . The manufacturer contact ( Higher Peak LLC , Winchester , Massachusetts ( MA ) 01890 ) order deliver new nitrogen generator . 4 . Psychosocial ( non-medical ) risk Psychosocial risk include prolonged indoor exposure perceive isolation subject 's daily routine , family friend . Subjects ready access personal communication device ( e.g . smart phone voice/ social medium use ) time actively participate test procedure . Subjects may visit person study floor . We anticipate psychosocial risk study subject participation protocol . Strict confidentiality maintain research team time , include keep data secure , lock cabinet limited access . All specimen cod obtain code key keep locked cabinet . All electronic data store Partners encrypt laptop . Samples give party outside MGH analysis cod maintain confidentiality . Monitoring Quality Insurance : Due small size study , independent monitoring deem necessary . The PI responsible monitoring study . The PI co-Is responsible monitoring study . Dr. Lorenzo Berra Principal Investigator Anesthesiologist Intensivist MGH Assistant Professor Harvard Medical School . Stopping rule The principal investigator co-investigators perform review decision regard alter stop protocol . Mild moderate adverse event present progress report continue review . Protocol exit criterion : - Desaturation : SpO2 &lt; 70 % 1 minute immediately responsive oxygen therapy . - Chest pain evidence ischemia electrocardiography ( EKG ) ( e.g. , T-wave inversion , ST segment change ) . - Signs symptom acute pulmonary edema : - Rapidly progressive , severe shortness breath rest.. - Severe dyspnea , feel suffocate drown despite return normoxia . - Wheezing gasp accompany anxiety , restlessness sense apprehension . - A cough produce frothy sputum may ting blood - Signs symptom acute cerebral edema : - acute ataxia alter mental status - focal neurologic deficit . - Increase systolic pulmonary artery pressure 15 mmHg baseline ( first trans-echocardiography ambient air ) - Syncope . - Febrile illness ( &gt; 100.4 two contiguous assay 1 hour apart ) - Subject may voluntarily withdraw study time .</detailed_description>
