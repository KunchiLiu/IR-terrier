	<brief_title>Exclusive Human Milk Feeding Infants With Single Ventricle Physiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single blind ( physician investigator ) , randomize , control trial evaluate growth velocity clinical outcome infant single ventricle physiology feed exclusive human milk diet initial hospitalization birth 30 day post-surgical repair feed period hospital discharge , whichever come first . Subjects randomize one two group birth immediately follow diagnosis prenatal care obtain prior birth . Parents decline participation infant study ask consent data gathering infant treat fed per institutional practice . The data individual summarize evaluate descriptively comparison actual trial result . All patient receive exclusive maternal human milk donor human milk prior randomization . Once randomize , patient Group One receive exclusive human milk diet prior surgery throughout 30-day feeding period follow surgical repair hospital discharge , whichever come first . Day 1 define day first enteral feed post-surgery . Patients Group Two ( Control Group ) receive maternal human milk formula donor human milk ( per standard care hospital ) pre-surgical period . In post-surgical period control group receive human milk formula , per feed algorithm The primary objective study evaluate growth velocity ( weight velocity [ g/kg/day ] weight z-score World Health Organization ( WHO ) growth chart ) 30 day initiation fee post-surgery infant single ventricle physiology feed exclusive human milk diet birth 30 day feeding period follow surgical repair hospital discharge , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
