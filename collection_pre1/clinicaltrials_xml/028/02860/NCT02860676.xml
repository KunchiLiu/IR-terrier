	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety investigational drug call cirmtuzumab give duration 6 12 month . Cirmtuzumab type drug call monoclonal antibody . This drug design attach protein call ROR1 surface chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cell . This block growth survival CLL cell . ROR1 rarely express healthy cell drug target cancer cell . Cirmtuzumab consider experimental use approve United States ( US ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Although evidence test laboratory animal cirmtuzumab decrease number CLL cell , investigator know work human . Therefore , goal study see cirmtuzumab safe tolerable study participant give duration 6 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study UC-961 ( Cirmtuzumab ) Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treated Previously With UC-961</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label extension study determine safety efficacy . Patients enrol initial phase 1 trial CLL eligible enrollment extension trial . UC-961 administer intravenous infusion every 14 day 4 dos , every 28 day 4 dos , response assess . Patients objective response ( meet work group criterion partial response complete response ) continue dose schema . Patients stable disease progressive disease eligible increase dose UC-961 another 6-month course . Duration UC-961 administration disease progression , treatment intolerance , lack clinical benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical phenotypic verification B cell CLL measurable disease . Immunophenotyping leukemic cell ( blood marrow ) must demonstrate monoclonal ( light chain positive ) B cell population immunophenotype consistent CLL ( e.g. , coexpressing CD19 CD5 ) . Recovered toxic effect attribute UC961 grade 1 level , baseline . Must measurable disease , include one following : absolute lymphocyte count great 5000/uL lymphadenopathy great 1.5 cm long dimension splenomegaly bone marrow biopsy residual CLL cell , resultant bone marrow dysfunction Women childbearing potential must agree become pregnant duration study . Both men woman must agree use barrier method contraception duration study 10 week final dose UC961 . Subjects must ECOG performance status 02 . Adequate hematologic function Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Adequate coagulation test Pregnant breastfeed woman Intervening therapy since completion initial UC961 dosing , exclude following : Within 14 day , 5 halflives ( know ) , whichever short , UC961 restart : small molecule kinase inhibitor ( eg : ibrutinib , idelalisib , AVL292 , IPI145 ) ; Within 28 day UC961 restart : chemotherapy ( e.g. , purine analogue , alkylating agent ) , corticosteroid , radiation therapy , participation investigational drug treatment ( besides UC961 ) ; Within 56 day UC961 restart : previous UC961 dosing ; Within 8 week UC961 restart : monoclonal antibody therapy direct CLL ( eg . rituximab , ofatumumab , obinutuzumab , alemtuzumab ) . Current infection require parenteral antibiotic . Active infection HIV , HBV , HCV . Concurrent malignancy prior malignancy within previous 3 year ( completely resect carcinoma situ , prostate cancer , localize nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Known central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement malignancy . Untreated autoimmunity autoimmune hemolytic anemia , immune thrombocytopenia . Uncompensated hypothyroidism ( define TSH great 2x upper limit normal treated replacement hormone ) . Presence 55 % prolymphocytes peripheral blood . Patients Richter 's transformation exclude . Insufficient recovery surgicalrelated trauma wound healing . Impaired cardiac function .</criteria>
