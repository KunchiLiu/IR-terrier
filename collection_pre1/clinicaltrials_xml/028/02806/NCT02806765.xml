	<brief_title>Effect Dietary Supplementation Dynamic Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate effect single nutrient dietary supplement dynamic stability old population . Dynamic stability , walk stability , assess accelerometer subject walk flat surface 60 second . Dynamic stability define maximum Lyapunov exponent ( maxLE ) , Floquet multiplier , motor control timing , change baseline . Postural stability also measure still stand subject , foot placement standardize force plate , subject look forward direction arm side . Two visual condition give : eyes-open ( EO ) eyes-closed ( EC ) . Each measurement last 60 second repeat twice condition . A three-minute rest provide measurement .</detailed_description>
