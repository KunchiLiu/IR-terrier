	<brief_summary>Expedient diagnosis management acute cauda equina syndrome ( CES ) essential prevent long-term neurological sequela patient . The clinical diagnosis CES confirm use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . However clinical feature CES ( secondary bladder bowel sphincter dysfunction ) variable common presenting feature pathology bladder bowel , therefore patient undergo MRI suspect CES compressive lesion evident MRI , exclude diagnosis CES . Urgent MRI scan perform hour therefore often unnecessary , however , morbidity patient due delay diagnosis significant urgent MRI scan current gold standard duty care case suspect CES . More objective method assess patient suspect acute CES could allow ration hour MRI scan reduce inappropriate admission without impact patient safety . The aim study evaluate effectiveness clinical algorithm utilises digital rectal examination ultrasound bladder scan stratify patient high low risk group . Patients consider high risk admit sent urgent MRI , whereas low risk patient discharge undergo MRI scan within 5 day presentation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-void Bladder Scanning Acute Cauda Equina Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient suspect CES see assessed member on-call team i.e . either spinal fellow , spinal SpR , orthopaedic SpR junior doctor , presentation . Clinical feature document stored patient note . This document photocopy use study . Digital rectal examination perform assess anal sphincter tone , voluntary control ( anal contraction ) sensation sharp light touch chaperone present . Those abnormal perianal sensation admit referred urgent MRI . ( NB : For purpose study , patient also undergo pre post-micturition bladder scan order allow correlation perianal sensation residual urine volume assess thoroughly . ) Bladder scan use measure pre post-micturition residual urine volume patient normal perianal sensation . The on-call spinal registrar , fellow consultant conduct bladder scan use BARDSCAN IIs ultrasound device . Patients residual urine volume great 100ml admit referred urgent MRI . Patients normal perianal sensation residual urine volume le 100ml however discharge receive MRI scan outpatient within 5 day presentation . These patient advise progression symptom re-attend hospital . Any patient re-attends , whilst wait out-patient MRI , admit urgent MRI . Assessment patient unable void follow pre-micturition bladder scan depend upon bladder volume . Those measure great 100ml catheterise sent MRI , whereas patient less 100ml encourage try 1 hour . Patients fail void time also catheterise sent MRI . Patient Follow-up All patient followed-up consultant responsible care . Patients operate confirmed CES see clinic six week six month follow surgery ( require ) . Patients require surgery see next available clinic ( usually within two week ) . Any unfortunate patient continue experience bladder and/or bowel dysfunction complication CES refer urology , urogynaecology , neurology and/ colorectal service appropriate . Data Synthesis , Management Analysis A pro forma use assess case suspect CES . This complete part initial assessment member on-call spinal team store patient 's note . Demographic data also collect . These document photocopy note data transfer Excel spread sheet store RD &amp; E NHS password protect computer . Hospital number serve patient identifier . Photocopies store spinal research office , lock use . Data store ten year follow end study period destruction . Statistical analysis carry use IBM SPSS Statistics v21 Mac . Descriptive statistic calculate comparison mean carry accord distribution data . The sensitivity specificity propose diagnosis algorithm , well positive predictive value , calculate accord 2x2 table . For group analysis ANOVA use test difference patient without post-residual volume &gt; 100ml , independent t-test perform . A p value 0.05 consider statistically significant . Dissemination Results To best knowledge first study investigate use post-micturition bladder scan part clinical algorithm patient suspect acute CES . It intention investigator disseminate outcome study regional , national international scientific peer group . Authorship , accountability acknowledgement follow guidance outline International Committee Medical Editors . For core protocol publication ( report primary secondary objective trial ) , protocol team serf write team , usually protocol chair lead author . For cross-protocol publication , permission lead investigator , team member may act write team may include additional author appropriate . Additional author may include investigator , usually member trial staff inter-departmental collaborator , and/or site investigator . The principal investigator protocol team member may present data scientific meeting .</detailed_description>
