	<detailed_description>To date , novel pharmacologic method reduce blood loss describe woman risk placenta accreta . Intravenous tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , drug anti-fibrinolytic activity , routinely use elective orthopedic cardiac surgery reduce blood loss . Intravenous tranexamic acid currently FDA approve use patient undergo cardiac surgery total knee arthroplasty total hip arthroplasty reduce peri- post-operative blood loss reduce need blood transfusion . There grow interest application tranexamic acid obstetrics gynecology . In multiple international study , intravenous TXA show significantly reduce blood loss give prophylactically cesarean delivery vaginal delivery without increase morbidity adverse thrombotic event .
