	<brief_summary>Bicuspid Aortic Valve ( BAV ) disease common cardiac anomaly associate valvular abnormality , stenosis regurgitation , aortopathy . It also show play role abnormal aortic distensibility stiffness impairment aortic elasticity Left ventricular dysfunction . Mechanism aortopathy complex understood completely . In recent study podocan find extracellular matrix ( ECM ) human aorta find accumulated human abdominal aortic aneurysm . There current effective therapy alter progression aortic dilatation bicuspid valve disease . Aortic surgery aortoplasty treatment severely dilate aorta aortic dissection . In study aim investigate association podocan Wnt pathway development pathogenesis aortopathy . This could provide effective physiological understand disease process potential target prevention treatment aortopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients know BAV enrol two inclusion criterion category : - Group A : Patients schedule cardiac MRI Procedures Group A : MRI use standard procedure confirm morphology bicuspid valve especially uncertain case accurate aortic measurement . Patients agree participate provide inform consent prior cardiac MRI/CT . A 6 minute walk test measure baseline functional status perform consent . All patient cardiac MRI/CT IV line place normal procedure . When line place , prior contrast infusion blood sample collect test circulatory Podocan Wnt pathway molecule . At 24 month post procedure follow information collect participant ' chart endpoint analysis : - All cause mortality - Hospital admission Aortic dissection , Congestive heart failure , endocarditis cardiac death - Valve replacement aortic graft surgery - Group B : Patients already MRI within past year Procedures Group B : MRI use standard procedure confirm morphology bicuspid valve especially uncertain case accurate aortic measurement . Patients agree participate report Clinical Research Division ( CRD ) research visit enroll study . At visit , patient provide inform consent , complete 6 minute walk test measure baseline functional status , blood drawn venipuncture obtain blood sample test circulatory Podocan Wnt pathway molecule . At 24 month post procedure follow information collect participant ' chart endpoint analysis : - All cause mortality - Hospital admission Aortic dissection , Congestive heart failure , endocarditis cardiac death - Valve replacement aortic graft surgery All patient undergo valve replacement aortic graft surgery within 24 month follow period , valve tissue sample analyze podocan level . These tissue remove routine part surgery send clinical laboratory Bassett . The number tissue sample collect procedure range one four base exact nature location aortic pathology . The Bassett Clinical Lab prepare additional paraffin block slide tissue research study . A blood sample also take time patient 's post-op MRI test circulatory Podocan Wnt pathway molecule . This usually occur 6-9 month surgery . It expect 100 participant enrol study 18 month . This sample size convenience pilot study base current volume patient undergoing cardiac MRI/CT evaluation valvular disease . Of 100 patient , estimate 25 undergo surgery describe within study period . Baseline analysis perform study association circulatory Podocan Wnt regulatory molecule ( Wnt-1 , Wnt-3 , Dkk-1 , WIF-1 , sFRP-1 , sFRP-3 ) measure ELISA peripheral blood tissue sample aortic root/ascending aorta . Each participant 's chart review time enrollment follow variable abstract medical record : - age , - gender , - ethnicity , - Most recent Ht , Wt , BP , HR - BMI - Tobacco use/history - Alcohol use/ history - Comorbidities - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Diabetes - CKD - Cancer - CAD - Info previous echocardiogram : - Ejection fraction - Valve area - Gradient - Info previous cardiac cath ( do ) : - Presence/absence coronary stenosis - Location degree stenosis - Aortic valve area - Calculation valve area - Info previous ECG : - Rhythm - LVH - Medications - Laboratory data : - Lipids - Chemistries - CBC - HgA1C - Troponin - BNP</detailed_description>
