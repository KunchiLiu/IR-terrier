	<brief_title>Comparison Hip Range Motion Values Among NCAA Division II Collegiate Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently normative data hip passive ROM apparently healthy NCAA division II collegiate athlete . This study first study develop preliminary normative data hip passive ROM . One hundred ( N=100 ) student athlete ( 18-45 year ) California State University Dominguez Hills ( CSUDH ) recruit study via convenience sampling . Data collection take place CSUDH sport medicine laboratory . Prior test , participant fill screen questionnaire question represent exclusion criterion use determine ineligibility study . Prior participant recruitment enrollment , pilot study do 10 participant establish rater reliability use method mention . After acceptable reliability achieve , recruitment enrollment continue . Participants meet inclusion criterion consent participate enrol study . Participants read sign CSUDH approve consent form prior begin data collection . Following consent , participant also fill questionnaire provide demographic information include age , height , weight , leg dominance . Following completion paperwork , participant undergo test conduct hour 8am 4pm . Each data collection session last approximately 20 minute . Bilateral hip passive ROM data collect use Noraxon computerize motion system . Participants lie different position examination table hip joint low extremity move different position measure device touch skin . Data collect monitor examiner use computerized system . The data collection protocol low extremity follow : 1 . Supine measure ( passive ) : hip external rotation , hip internal rotation 2 . Rest : 5-minute delay 3 . Seated measure ( passive ) : hip external rotation , hip internal rotation 4 . Rest : 5-minute delay 5 . Prone measurement ( passive ) : hip external rotation , hip internal rotation Collected data transfer SPSS v.22 ( IBM SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . Means , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , range participant descriptive data calculate . Passive Hip ROM value present use degree percentage . Athlete gender sport difference calculate use ANOVA statistic . The p-value consider significant .05 level use two-tailed test ( Î±2 =.05 ) .</detailed_description>
