	<brief_title>Pneumococci Hib Vaccination After Neurotrauma Neurosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There risk meningitis neurotrauma different action take reduce risk . Prophylactic antibiotic often administer , although present little evidence support regimen . Increasing problem antibiotic resistance heightens need pertinent use antibiotic . Even infection occur early course , risk appear persist many year almost half posttraumatic meningitis case occur one month . Streptococcus pneumoniae common causative agent pneumococcal vaccination neurotrauma recommend several national guideline . There , however , recommendation administer vaccine . In clinical practice , vaccination often perform several week trauma . Because risk meningitis high shortly trauma , vaccination within day would preferable . Until recently , pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV ) common recommendation . During recent year pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) introduce , offer long-term protection recommend USA . Trauma , well surgery , activate innate immune system result , among thing , decrease T-cell function . Patients injuries central nervous system ( CNS ) may show sign specific CNS-injury-induced immune deficiency syndrome ( CIDS ) , also characterize impaired T-cell activity . Accordingly , speculate ongoing anti-inflammatory response trauma , refer trauma-induced immune deficiency syndrome ( TIDS ) , CIDS impair T-cell function could negatively affect response vaccine , especially T-cell dependent conjugate vaccine . In present thesis , focus impact TIDS CIDS response T-cell dependent T-cell independent vaccine . Methods Vaccination A conjugate vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) choose T-cell-dependent antigen . All patient receive single subcutaneous injection 0.5 ml Act-HIB® ( Sanofi Pasteur MSD , Lyon , France ) upper right arm . A 0.5 ml dose vaccine contain 10 μg Hib polysaccharide conjugate 24 microgram tetanus protein . All patient also receive , time , single subcutaneous injection 0.5 ml Pneumovax® ( Sanofi Pasteur MSD AB , Lyon , France ) ( PPSV23 ) contain 25 μg purify capsular polysaccharide 23 serotypes ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6B , 7F , 8 , 9N , 9V , 10A , 11A , 12F , 14 , 15B , 17F , 18C , 19A , 19F , 20 , 22F , 23F 33F ) upper leave arm . Patients NT NS group vaccinate within 10 day trauma surgery . Control patient vaccinate , accord local routine pneumococcal vaccination , least three week trauma surgery . Adverse reaction vaccine record case report form . Sera collection analysis Pre-vaccination serum collect vaccination post-vaccination serum obtain three six week vaccination . Samples store -70oC pending analysis . The laboratory blind respect group assignment patient . IgG antibody concentration Hib polysaccharide determine enzyme immunoassay establish accredited methodology . An anti-Hib polysaccharide antibody concentration 0.15 -1.0 μg/ml associate long-term protection invasive Hib infection vaccination child Hib polysaccharide vaccine . Based previous experience child , post-vaccination concentration 10 μg/ml , 10 time upper suppose protective concentration , choose target level good response vaccination study . Serotype-specific anti-polysaccharide binding IgG antibody level serotypes 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F 23F determine enzyme immunoassay establish accredited methodology . A serotype-specific IgG &gt; 0.35 μg/ml define correlate protection invasive disease infant recipient ( PCV ) . The true correlate protection adult vaccination PPSV23 know . The value 1.0 μg/ml chosen target level good response vaccination study .</detailed_description>
