	<brief_title>The Effect Oral PhenazopyrIdine Perioperative Voiding After Mid-urethral sliNg ( EPIPhANy Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design randomization This study randomize control trial . Randomization perform use software block randomization scheme . Study assignment complete use sequentially number seal opaque envelope . All research procedure describe use phenazopyridine applicable arm study . Subjects 50 % chance get either phenazopyridine nothing . Because pyridium turn urine orange , impossible blind patient researcher study assignment . Because know placebo turn urine orange , value use actual placebo tablet . Subjects assign either receive pyridium receive pyridium preoperatively . Screening potential subject : Investigators screen potential subject contraindication methylene blue . Prior obtain routine surgical consent potential subject 's surgical procedure , patient 's medical history UMass Electronic Medical Record routinely review . The medical record review diagnosis G6PD find , potential subject exclude . Once write consent obtain , subject number assign appropriate randomization envelope open . The study assignment formally share subject . Those assign `` pyridium '' arm order write standard 200 mg dose pyridium give arrival Surgical Admissions Care Unit ( SACU ) . Those assign `` NO pyridium '' arm routine preoperative order write along order `` No preoperative pyridium '' . Subjects follow routine perioperative care procedure study intervention gather PHI perform postoperative pain assessment . PHI obtain time surgical consent purpose evaluate possible confounders affect postoperative bladder function . Surgical procedure : The Mid Urethral Sling perform standard fashion base manufacturer 's recommendation instruction minimize inter-observer variation . We perform procedure accord usual customary technique . The subject receive technique intervention routine patient Urogyn service would expect undergo . There change technique purpose study . Bladder challenge : Patient undergo void trial day surgery per usual customary protocol . This protocol subject would undergo patient Urogyn service . The bladder challenge interpret usual manner subject manage accord routine clinical protocol . Postoperative care : Subjects undergo routine postoperative care followup . Subjects fail bladder challenge see Urogyn clinic accord routine clinical protocol data concern void trial collect . Subjects undergo routine followup evaluation 6 week postoperatively order assess potential long-term voiding dysfunction . Information postoperative complication collect Administration Visual analog scale : ( 1 ) Visual analog scale assessment pain administer two- time interval . 1 . VAS # 1 ) Preoperative VAS do principal investigator study assistant . The VAS form part subject 's packet . 2 . VAS # 2 ) VAS administer one study investigator 2 3 hour surgical procedure SACU .</detailed_description>
