	<brief_summary>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) fifth lead cause cancer-related death Western country , incidence increase last 40 year . Curative surgery manage PDAC possible fraction patient ; indeed , vast majority ( 85 % ) patient diagnose locally advanced tumor and/or metastasis lack specific symptom early marker disease . For patient , palliative armamentarium consist conventional chemotherapeutic agent Gemcitabine , recently , FOLFIRINOX , offer marginal survival benefit . Consequently , prognosis PDAC still poor great need new treatment change poor outcome . In context , investigator devise , past year , highly innovative approach base therapeutic gene transfer , rely specific genetic and/or cellular background inhibit PDAC tumor growth . investigator find SSTR2 DCK : :UMK gene transfer demonstrate complementary therapeutic effect inhibit tumor progression dissemination , reduced tumor burden , respectively . On basis promise preclinical data , investigator conduct past three year first clinical study non-viral vector-mediated therapeutic gene delivery , guide endoscopy ( EUS ) , combine standard Gemcitabine therapy patient locally advance metastatic PDAC . The phase 1 demonstrate gene-therapy product CYL-02 express PDAC tumor ( long-lasting expression within tumor tissue ) , distribute within bloodstream extent , combine Gemcitabine inhibit primary-tumor progression dissemination . Our result tend demonstrate therapeutic efficacy , especially patient locally advanced tumor . Based encouraging result , investigator propose patient locally advance PDAC time diagnosis may clinically benefit approach . This phase II study design compare efficacy intra-tumoral gene delivery CYL-02 plus Gemcitabine treatment Gemcitabine alone patient locally advanced PDAC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma fifth lead cause cancer relate death Western country . The sole curative treatment surgical resection . Unfortunately , curative surgery possible 10 15 % case . In palliative way , remain patient treat chemotherapy locally advanced ( Gemcitabine ) metastatic ( FOLFIRINOX ) tumor . These treatment ameliorate clinical parameter modestly median survival . There urgent need novel treatment gene therapy one innovative approach . The investigator demonstrate SST2 gene ( code somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ) transfer pancreatic experimental tumour significantly decrease tumor progression exert anti-metastatic effect . SST2 gene transfer also induce local bystander effect due antiproliferative , pro-apoptotic anti-angiogenic action . SST2 gene transfer also sensitize pancreatic tumor therapeutic effect Gemcitabine . In order improve chemosensitization investigator add DCK : :UMK gene , fusion two cDNAs cod enzymes critical Gemcitabine intracellular metabolism . Effect DCK : :UMK gene transfer combination Gemcitabine treatment dramatically reduce size primary tumour experimental model pancreatic cancer . Finally , combine SST2 DCK : :UMK gene transfer use single expression plasmid intratumorally inject , investigator obtain significant `` regression '' experimental primary pancreatic tumor ( Patent Cayla-INSERM 2010 ) . In collaboration Invivogen company , proof concept lead u set pilot Phase I clinical trial gene therapy unresectable pancreatic cancer patient . For phase I gene therapy trial ( THERGAP-01NCT01274455 Dec. 2010 - Sept. 2012 ) , investigator produce gene therapy product ( CYL-02 ) GMP grade ( plasmid encode SST2 DCK : :UMK gene complexed non-viral synthetic vector PolyEthyleneImine 22 kDa ) . The protocol base two Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided direct intratumoral injection ( one month interval ) increase dos DNA ( 125 1000 µg ) follow Gemcitabine infusion within 2 month . After inclusion 22 unresectable pancreatic cancer patient investigator demonstrate excellent feasibility protocol whatever localization tumor previous treatment . No serious adverse event directly imputable experimental product occur . There major diffusion CYL-02 blood ( none urine ) transgene detect expressed tumour tissue dose-dependent manner one month post-injection ( maximum dose 1000µg - DNA + mRNA ) . Primary tumor reduce size one month remain stable 2 month metastatic progression subgroup locally advance patient median progression-free survival overall survival respectively 6.4 12.6 month . These result tend demonstrate therapeutic effect lead randomize open multicenter phase 2 trial compare therapeutic effect association `` intratumoral delivery gene therapy product CYL-02 plus gemcitabine '' versus `` gemcitabine alone '' patient locally advance non metastatic unresectable/untreated patient . The primary objective compare effect modality treatment progression free survival . The secondary objective compare effect overall survival , evaluate antitumor response , Quality Life local general tolerance . For 6 french center investigator plan include 100 patient ( 18 month inclusion , 12 month duration trial patient ) prove locally advanced non metastatic untreated pancreatic adenocarcinoma , 50 patient Arm : Arm A : two EUS-guided injection CYL-02 ( dose 1000 µg ) one month interval combination Gemcitabine infusion 1000 mg/m2 every week within two month follow 4 month ( progression ) Gemcitabine ( dose rhythm ) ; Arm B : Gemcitabine alone 1000 mg/m2 within 6 month ( progression ) . In Arm patient subject clinical imaging follow 6 month include treatment . CYL-02 compound produce supply DBI/Eurofins finance Invivogen company . This clinical trial accompany independent monitoring committee , review safety data provide recommendation Sponsor regard safety subject , conduct study potential premature termination . Evaluation make upon clinical symptom , sign tumor progression , EUS Arm A ( one month ) , CT-Scan , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 12 month ( ARM A B , RECIST 1.1 criterion ) . Quality Life every month ( EORTC QLC-C30 questionnaire ) , local general tolerance Pharmacokinetics CYL-02 also assess . The dose 1000 µg use corresponds maximal dose test phase 1b ( Thergap-1 ) . This dose demonstrate long lasting expression within tumor , good antitumor effect good tolerance ( buscail et al , mol 2015 ) .</detailed_description>
