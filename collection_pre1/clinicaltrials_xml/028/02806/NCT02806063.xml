	<brief_summary>Chronic prosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) devastate complication arthroplasty treatment continue fuel debate manage appropriately . One stage two stage exchange surgery conventional surgical procedure chronic PJI commonly use date . Two stage surgery disadvantage ( major surgery , anesthesia nosocomial risk , functional impairment surgery high socio-economic coast ) encourage many surgical team adopt one stage exchange surgery provide equivalent good outcome . However one stage surgery encounter major conceptual difficulty come implant new prosthesis surgical site microbiologically undetermined potentially contaminate . Investigators suppose new prosthesis implant contaminate set regardless bacteria type antibiotic therapy duration arthroplasty . The total lack data answer question motivate conception prospective study order describe microbiological setting implant new prosthesis one stage exchange surgery surgical excision antibiotic therapy initiation chronic PJI .</brief_summary>
