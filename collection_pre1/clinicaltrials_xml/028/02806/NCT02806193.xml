	<detailed_description>A global CMR registry crucial infrastructure CMR community many benefit . First , large collective body evidence reflect current clinical application patient care , healthcare payer govern body alike depend metric test appropriateness , common indication , diagnostic effectiveness need . Second , reflect change patient impact CMR time technical development evolve . Third , allow assessment improvement diagnostic therapeutic evaluation , risk stratification , cost-effectiveness analysis relevant patient management . Some practical question global CMR registry may able ot address include : 1 . Variations CMR protocol within specific clinical indication 2 . Variations CMR post-processing , analysis , report 3 . Practice adherence appropriateness criterion guideline 4 . Clinical effectiveness CMR long period clinical application and/or technological advance 5 . Differences CMR utility across center , region , country The data collection process collective effort part specialize health professional across various CMR site worldwide . All data extract exist registry database . Health professional U.S. abroad first upload patient data image onto registry/database currently use . Then choose , transmit relevant patient de-identified data onto global registry use user-friendly web interface . CMR sit without database invite use CMR Cooperative REDCAP . De-identified data ( usually submit excel CSV format ) harmonize uploaded registry website ( www.gcmr-scmr.org ) , firewall password-protected database reside IT vendor ( Center Systems Biology Massachusetts General Hospital ) Boston , Massachusetts . The pooled data use retrospective analysis/research approve GCMR steer committee SCMR .</detailed_description>
