	<brief_summary>Small bowel capsule endoscopy test use investigate abnormality small bowel . The small bowel 4 meter long . The battery time capsule 8 hour . During time capsule take picture pass small bowel . In 15-20 % capsule test battery expire capsule pass entire small bowel colon . Incomplete test indicate variable portion small bowel visualize . Incomplete test associate potential miss abnormality portion small bowel reach . The capsule test may often require repeat problem incomplete examination may persist . At present medication approve increase rate complete capsule test . Prucalopride medication approve Canada Europe treatment chronic idiopathic constipation . Animal human study suggest prucalopride may enhance movement stomach small bowel . A recent presentation medical meeting suggest prucalopride may accelerate passage capsule camera small bowel without increase chance miss lesion small bowel . The purpose study asses administration single dose prucalopride go decrease time require capsule move small bowel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prucalopride Prior Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capsule Endoscopy first test investigate small bowel disease . Clinical condition capsule endoscopy useful include gastrointestinal bleeding unclear source , Crohn 's disease , celiac disease suspect small bowel tumor . Optimal diagnostic yield capsule endoscopy depend adequate small bowel visualization , also completion small bowel examination . In approximately 15-20 % capsule study , capsule fails pass small bowel colon limit battery time 8 hour . This mean lesion abnormality miss portion small bowel reach capsule . As result , capsule endoscopy test may often need repeat . Multiple factor associate prolongation time require capsule pas small bowel include hospitalization , prior small bowel surgery , diabetes advanced age addition prolongation time require capsule pas stomach . Interventions shorten small bowel transit time required increase capsule small bowel completion rate . At present drug approve shorten small bowel transit time . Prucalopride drug approve use patient chronic constipation . Prucalopride work special receptor gut stimulate gut movement . There basic clinical study suggest prucalopride may accelerate movement stomach small bowel . Therefore , prucalopride may accelerate passage capsule small bowel increase capsule completion rate . The investigator trial recently present experience prucalopride use prior capsule endoscopy medical meeting . Compared retrospective control group receive prucalopride , prucalopride accelerated passage capsule small bowel . There decrease diagnostic yield group receive prucalopride . In clinical trial , investigator aim investigate effect prucalopride small bowel transit time , perform randomize placebo control trial . Patients undergo small bowel capsule endoscopy test randomize single dose prucalopride ingest time capsule endoscopy ingestion , placebo pill . The primary objective study examine administration single dose prucalopride shorten small bowel transit time compare placebo . The secondary objective include examine effect prucalopride gastric transit time , small bowel capsule endoscopy completion rate capsule diagnostic yield . The placebo group use clinical trial drug proven effective shorten small bowel transit time . Based experience investigator , average small bowel transit time patient give prucalopride 143 minute . In retrospective control group , small bowel transit time 229 minute standard deviation 90 minute . Based presumed 20 % minimal clinically important difference small bowel transit time , investigator determine total 122 participant require , equally divide two study arm .</detailed_description>
