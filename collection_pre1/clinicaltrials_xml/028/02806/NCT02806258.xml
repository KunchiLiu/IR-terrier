	<brief_title>Comparing Sequential Neoadjuvant Treatment Including Chemotherapy Accelerated Radiation Focused Tumor Bed v Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I : The total APBI dose set level I 20 Gy ( 10 fraction 5 day ; n=5 ) level II 24 Gy ( 12 fraction 6 day ) deliver tumor use two fractions/day 2 Gy space least 6 hour . The biological effective dose ( BED ) 32 Gy 47 Gy alpha/beta 10 3.5 , respectively . As compare standard fractionation 2 Gy/fraction BED 26.8 Gy 30 Gy 2 value alpha/beta . In case impossibility deliver two fractions/day , patient treat use single fraction 3.125 Gy/day 8 fraction ( total dose 25 Gy ) . The BED 32.8 Gy 47.3 Gy alpha/beta 10 3.5 , respectively . As compare standard fractionation 2 Gy/fraction BED 27.3 Gy 30.1 Gy 2 value alpha/beta . In scheme , 95 % prescribe dose deliver least 90 % PTV . All patient undergo BCS end PST-APBI receive postoperative WBI ( +/- nodal area ) deliver total dose 45-50 Gy use standard fractionation ( 1.8 2 Gy ) hypofractionated schedule use &gt; 15 fraction 3 week . Technique boost delivery leave investigator 's discretion local policy . Patients TM also receive PMRT indicate deliver 45-50.4 Gy use standard fractionation ( 1.8 2 Gy ) . If patient complete full course PST prior surgery , CT give prior immediately follow postoperative RT depend institutional protocol . Other post-operative treatment investigator 's discretion . Adjuvant hormonal treatment administer HR+ patient . Phase II : This phase II randomize study design patient newly diagnose intermediate high risk non-metastatic BC candidate minimum six cycle PST use anthracycline and/or taxane base regimen , desire BCS eligible due tumor/breast ratio . All patient clip tumor bed first 1-2 cycle PST . Eligible patient consent participate study randomize treatment Arm A B : Arm A : 6-8 cycle PST use anthracycline and/or taxane base regimen , accord physician 's preference center policy . Arm B : The patient receive 3D conformal modality ( eg IMRT , VMAT ) APBI PST sequence . APBI plan sequentially PST cycle , 2 week 3rd/6 4th/8 cycle PST . For purpose quality target volume definition , mandatory make plan CT-scan treatment position initiation chemotherapy . MRI US fusion CT scan image increase target volume definition use necessary . For patient , treatment planning make plan CT-scan shortly precede initiation radiation therapy take possible tumor shrinkage breast shape change account . The CTV define GTV + 1cm . The margin PTV depend measurement center thereby position verification technique . If know , PTV define CTV + 1 cm around . The PTV use beam shape dose evaluation calculation PTVeval define PTV exclude skin + 5 mm thoracic wall ( ribs intercostal muscle ) . IMRT use protocol . The PTVeval exceed 40 % total breast volume . Study Arms : All patient must undergo surgery even case clinical complete response . Surgery schedule 4 6 week last day PST . Modified radical mastectomy indicate case limit clinical response , progressive disease , tumor size/breast size permit BCS . The decision base US MRI confirmation response . Post TM radiation therapy apply accord center 's guideline . High risk patient receive nodal radiotherapy policy . All patient undergo BCS end PST-APBI , receive postoperative RT . This consist WBI ( +/- nodal area ) total dose 45-50 Gy use standard fractionation ( 1.8 2 Gy ) hypofractionated schedule use &gt; 15 fraction 3 week . Technique boost delivery leave investigator 's discretion local policy . Patients TM also receive PMRT , 45-50.4 Gy use standard fractionation ( 1.8 2 Gy ) . If patient complete full course PST prior surgery , CT give prior immediately follow postoperative RT depend institutional protocol . Other post-operative treatment investigator 's discretion . Adjuvant hormonal treatment administer HR+ patient . Standard protocol : The patient randomized standard treatment arm receive minimum 6-8 cycle PST use anthracycline and/or taxane base regimen . Surgery consist BCS TM accord clinical response tumor/breast volume ratio obtain PST . After surgery , patient receive standard RT whole breast ( 45-50.4 Gy 25-28 fraction ) equivalent use hypofractionated schedule &gt; 15 fraction 3 week . RT technique addition boost leave investigator decision accord institutional protocol . Adjuvant ET administer HR+ patient end radiotherapy least 5 year . Auxiliary translational study Tumor core biopsy translational study genetic analysis obtain baseline resect tumor surgery follow PST +/- APBI . This study focus prediction pCR use cell metabolism , hypoxia angiogenesis marker ( Scottish Group ) . Another objective correlate marker metabolic image pCR prediction ( Oscar Lambret Center , France ) .</detailed_description>
