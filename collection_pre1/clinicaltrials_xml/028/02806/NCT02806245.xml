	<brief_summary>Surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) congenital heart disease ( CHD ) cause low cardiac index ( CI ) . With increase success surgery CHD , mortality decrease emphasis shift post-operative morbidity recovery . Children CHD undergo surgery CPB experience well-characterized post-operative cardiac dysfunction . When severe , patient develop clinically important low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) hemodynamic instability . Management LCOS hemodynamic compromise primarily accomplish via intravenous durgs like milrinone , dopamine dobutamine , affect strength heart 's muscular contraction . These use maintain adequate blood pressure ( BP ) CI . However , inotropic agent potentially detrimental myocardial function may increase risk post-operative arrhythmia impair post-operative recovery increase oxygen demand myocardial oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) . In combination increase VO2 associate CPB-induced systemic inflammatory response patient develop critical mismatch oxygen supply demand , essentially definition LCOS . Therefore , therapy improve CI hemodynamic stability without increase VO2 beneficial . This study test whether BiVp , specialize yet simple pacing technique , improve post-operative CI recovery infant electro-mechanical dyssynchrony ( EMD ) CHD surgery . This study hypothesize Continuous BiVp increase mean change CI baseline 72 hour infant EMD follow CHD surgery compare standard care alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In adult heart failure intrinsic iatrogenic leave bundle branch block ( eg , RV pace ) , recently narrow QRS complex , pace heart advance pace technique leave right ventricle ( LV , RV ) term cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) improve rest systolic heart function mechanoenergetics.1 In patient , CRT show increase LV stroke volume , ejection fraction , stroke work , result enhancement LV myocardial efficiency , without increase oxidative metabolism even decrease energy utilization.2-4 Furthermore , oxygen consumption seem distribute homogeneously CRT.2 Beyond increase rest myocardial efficiency , CRT may increase metabolic reserve judge increase cardiac work response dobutamine.5 CRT also show restore homogeneous myocardial glucose metabolism , without decrease myocardial perfusion.6 These finding mirror similar finding regard effect CRT myocardial perfusion . Resting myocardial blood perfusion unaltered CRT despite increase leave ventricular function . However , distribution pattern rest myocardial blood perfusion become homogeneous , hyperemic myocardial blood perfusion myocardial blood perfusion reserve enhance CRT.7 In long-term , CRT improve morbidity mortality adult heart failure.8 , 9 Children myocardial dysfunction possibly mechanical dyssynchrony follow cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery . A significant number child congenital heart disease either interventricular conduction delay right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) . For example , RBBB may occur patient ventricular septal defect repair . Others child may develop iatrogenic bundle branch block require ventricular pace rate control , hemodynamic improvement atrioventricular block . When postoperative pacing indicate , current method use sense pace right atrium , depend indication , pace right ventricle ( univentricular pacing ) . However , conventional RV univentricular pacing may increase myocardial stress oxygen utilization inhomogeneous contraction,10 long-term right ventricular ( univentricular ) pace show patient detrimental effect leave ventricular remodeling , leave ventricular function clinical outcomes.11-13 Beyond potential pacing relate myocardial stress oxygen consumption , post-operative care child congenital heart disease necessitates use potent inotropic agent expense increase myocardial oxygen consumption , unwanted effect vulnerable post-bypass myocardium.14-16 Preliminary data child congenital heart disease undergoing surgical repair show acute benefit CRT manifest increase systolic blood pressure improve cardiac output associate reduced QRS duration . These beneficial effect obtain child single dual ventricular physiology.17-20 Pham et al show improvement cardiac index biventricular pace child heart surgery , conventional atrioventricular pacing , suggest patient need pace postoperative period , biventricular pacing well conventional pacing , conclusion previously reach adult set cardiomyopathy.21-23 Despite beneficial immediate hemodynamic effect , despite preliminary data beneficial effect CRT child congenital heart disease,24-26 know whether long period biventricular pace post-operative period follow surgery congenital heart disease beneficial whether intervention lead improve clinical outcome reduction use inotropes , time extubation length admission critical care unit . To answer question , prospective , randomized trial need . The current study would serve pilot study large trial event encourage result . Hypothesis Biventricular pace improves recovery cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass child congenital heart disease . Objectives Study effect biventricular pace post-operative hemodynamics clinical outcome child surgery congenital heart disease . Design Randomized , non-blinded , clinical intervention .</detailed_description>
