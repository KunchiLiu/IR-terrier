	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , open-label , single-arm , efficacy , PK , safety tolerability study IGSC 20 % subject PI . Approximately 60 subject enrol order approximately 20 adult subject 20 pediatric subject treat subcutaneously administer IGSC 20 % complete entire study . This study include 3 study stage : Screening/Previous Regimen Phase , IGSC 20 % Treatment Stage 1 ( 13 IGSC 20 % weekly dos ) , IGSC 20 % Treatment Stage 2 ( 39 IGSC 20 % weekly dos ) . Previous Regimen Phase : Subjects infuse current ongoing ( `` previous regimen '' ) IVIG/SCIG regimen ( pIV/pSC ) clinic obtain 2 trough IgG level ( obtain prior pIV/pSC infusion ) subject 's `` previous regimen '' . 20 % IGSC Treatment Stage 1 : The first dose IGSC 20 % administered clinical site immediately Baseline assessment complete ( SC # 1 ) . All subject receive 13 IGSC 20 % infusion weekly interval . IgG trough blood level measure ( except SC # 3 ) study visit All dose IGSC 20 % may infuse home ( properly train ) clinic . The Treatment Stage 1 dose continue IGSC 20 % Treatment Stage 2 . IGSC 20 % Treatment Stage 2 : The IGSC 20 % dose ( mg/kg ) remain constant dose adjustment permit phase , unless absolutely medically necessary . While subject SC # 17 clinic visit standard assessment , serial PK sampling perform subset adult subject :</detailed_description>
