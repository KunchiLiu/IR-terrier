	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate effect cold water immersion elayed onset muscle soreness , muscle recruitment , dynamic postural control quality sleep young soccer player . Methods : The sample consist 28 soccer player 18 21 year football club routine practice game . At first athlete respond IC submit test repetition maximum . After three day athletes analysis muscle recruitment electromyography dynamic posture control force platform time shooting , moreover , respond scale quality sleep previous night one pain , instruct perform fatigue protocol quadriceps randomize one four intervention group : cold water immersion , submersion water room temperature , active recovery control . The APPRAISAL remake three new moment , 24 , 48 72 hour fatigue test . Hypothesis : The variable consider : Pain intensity quadriceps muscle , quality sleep night intervention protocol , electromyographic analysis rectus femoris , vastus medialis oblique vastus lateralis time shooting , well postural control shot . It intend establish best way recovery late quadriceps muscle pain contribute clinical practice active recovery rest young soccer player .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The size power sample raise use sample size calculation , Power Sample Size program 95 % confidence interval , alpha level 5 % power 80 % , consider mean standard deviation data DOMS study Effects Cold Water Immersion Rugby Training muscle Power Biochemical Markers . Thus , sample set 48 volunteer , 12 distribute four group . Participate study 28 soccer player , age 16 21 year , male , train least 5 time week , complaint musculoskeletal pain history muscle injury past six month , hire club demand training competition . Exclusion criterion observe vascular problem , allergy cold , surgery low limb past six month , athletes viral state ( cold flu ) . These randomize four group : cold water immersion ( N = 7 ) immersion water room temperature ( n = 7 ) , active recovery ( n = 7 ) control ( N = 7 ) .</detailed_description>
