They randomize one three condition ( worry postponement , worry monitoring , assessment control ) . Participants follow instruction correspond condition daily two week . In worry postponement worry monitor condition involve complete brief daily worry questionnaires home two week intervention . In assessment condition participant complete measure two week first session . Subsequent , participant return lab repeat baseline measure , return two week later complete measure . The entire study require three lab visit , span four week . This study aim determine effect worry postponement , relative worry monitoring assessment , worry , GAD associate symptom , cognitive process related worry . A secondary aim study examine mechanism predict change worry worry postponement study . This first study knowledge , examine question sample people GAD .
