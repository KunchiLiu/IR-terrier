	<brief_title>Changes Tear Film With Scleral Contact Lens Wear Keratoconic Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scleral contact lenses rigid gas permeable lens design rest sclera vault cornea fluid reservoir . The use scleral contact lenses become current standard practice nonsurgical management corneal ectasia ocular surface disease . Cases recently present scleral lens wearer exhibit adverse corneal finding conjunctival injection lens wear . These finding likely associate mechanical hypoxic effect due poor fit characteristic limbal area . Tear film analysis detect change level proteinase cytokine help researcher gain good understand pathophysiology complication soft contact lenses wearer , dry eye , keratoconus . Ultimately , study provide insight relate scleral lens fit characteristic corneal limbal physiological response .</detailed_description>
