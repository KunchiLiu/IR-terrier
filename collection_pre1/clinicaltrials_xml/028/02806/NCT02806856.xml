	<brief_summary>Very early onset focal perfusion deficit , excitotoxic mechanism lethally damage neuron glia . Excitotoxicity trigger number event contribute tissue death . Such event include peri-infarct depolarization ( PID ) cortical spread depolarization ( CSD ) within peri-infarct zone ischaemic penumbra . Noninvasive brain stimulation technique transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) emerge promising tool , owe effect modulate cortical activity . Experimental study indicate cathodic polarization cortical surface block initiation CSD . Moreover , recently demonstrate murine stroke model cathodal tDCS exerts measurable neuroprotective effect acute phase stroke , decrease number spread depolarization reduce infarct volume 20 30 % . The investigator propose pilot study , acute middle cerebral artery stroke patient , double blind randomization : cathodal tDCS versus sham tDCS . The duration study two year . Fifty acute middle cerebral artery stroke patient include . The tDCS begin within 4.5 hour symptom onset . The main criterion evaluation extent diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) infarct volume image admission 24 hour later . The investigator propose hypothesis acute stroke patient , cathodal tDCS could adjuvant approach recanalizing therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In murine model , demonstrate cathodic polarization cortical surface intensity 30 µA high block spread depression completely . There study demonstrate stroke patient . tDCS powerful tool modulate excitability motor area . Cathodal tDCS induces decrease 30-50 % motor evoke potential amplitude . In another study , cathodal stimulation compare sham induce prolonged decrease tactile discrimination , sham stimulation . In study , cathodal stimulation deliver lateral motor area ( C3 C4 , 10-20 system ) use intensity 2 mA , order ass inhibition , hyperpolarization middle cerebral artery stroke ischemic penumbra could obtain . tDCS characterized excellent safety profile . tDCS study patient perform intensity comprise 1 2 mA . Safety intensity demonstrate . Minor tDCS adverse effect healthy human patient vary neurological disorder report . These tDCS study perform wide range neurological psychiatric condition include pain , depression , Parkinson disease stroke rehabilitation . Mild tingle sensation , moderate fatigue , itch sensation stimulate electrode , headache describe . Tinnitus also report . In human study , duration tDCS stimulation generally comprise 3 40 minute , iterative session . In study , tDCS begin less 4h30 beginning symptom . Studies murine stroke model demonstrate cathodal tDCS start 45 minute middle cerebral artery occlusion last 6 hour neuroprotective effect reduce infarct volume 30 % ( 20 % group 4 hour duration , compare sham ) . Based data , study , tDCS deliver 20 minute per hour , 6 hour . Usual neurovascular care ( IV thrombolysis , thrombectomy indicate ) unchanged . Some simulation study demonstrate approximately half current inject tDCS shunt scalp . Using stimulate current 2 mA , magnitude current density relevant region brain order 0.1 A/m2 , correspond electric field 0.22 V/m . Induced skin burn rare . Skin burn precede painful sensation . Saline-soaked sponge place electrode remain moist order avoid burn . In study , patient question tolerance tDCS stimulation hour . Impedance value tDCS electrode check hour . A cephalic electrode montage choose . A setup M1 placement target electrode ( C3 C4 , 10-20 system ) extra-cephalic placement return electrode ( shoulder ) lead twofold threefold high electric field brainstem compare commonly use cephalic setup target electrode M1 , return electrode contralateral fronto-polar area ( FP2 FP1 , 10-20 system ) . Reported cerebral autoregulation change may mediate via stimulation brainstem autonomic center . The use cephalic return electrode montage thus recommend . Accordingly recommendation , study , two electrode cephalic position : C3 C4 FP2 FP1 ( 10-20 system ) . The main objective study ass cathodic tDCS M1 ( C3 C4 ) acute stroke patient allow preserve penumbra reduce infarct volume ( MRI day 1 versus admission MRI ) . Secondary objective : 1. determine tDCS improve clinical outcome 7 day stroke use National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) 2. determine tDCS improve clinical outcome 3 month stroke use Rankin scale 3 . To assess tDCS side effect</detailed_description>
