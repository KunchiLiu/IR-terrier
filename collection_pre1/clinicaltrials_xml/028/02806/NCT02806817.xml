	<brief_summary>Prospective , randomize , open label , two arm , , phase 0 clinical trial . HER2-negative breast cancer patient recently diagnose screened trial participation . A biopsy schedule week prior day FDG PET . Paraffin-embedded tumor sample use evaluate staining Ki67 , cleave caspase-3 microvessels , frozen tumor sample use evaluate SDH staining . The FDG-PET follow bevacizumab dose ( 15 mg/kg IV , single dose ) . After one week , PET repeat order detect patient experience FDG uptake decay . Right , treatment ME-344 ( arm 1 ) treatment ( arm 2 ) start . ME-344 administer 10 mg/kg day 8 , 15 22 . Surgery perform day 28 ( thus , 4 week bevacizumab dose , consider safe window antiangiogenics ) . Fragments surgical specimen collect . Paraffin-embedded tumor sample use repeat ( compare ) stain Ki67 , cleave caspase-3 microvessels , frozen tumor sample use repeat ( compare ) SDH stain . Patients come trial case consent withdrawal , unequivocal disease progression observe , unacceptable toxicity occur , case intercurrent disease condition deem incompatible continuation clinical trial investigator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ME-344 Early HER2-negative Breast Cancer With Antiangiogenic-induced Mitochondrial Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiangiogenic agent widely use biologic agent oncology approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use many different malignancy base result several randomized phase III trial . However , acquire resistance antiangiogenics major problem cancer therapeutic . Some signal node implicate therapeutic resistance preclinical study . However , global tumor-reprogramming interrogation base change delivery oxygen nutrient undertaken . The finding link acquire resistance powerful anticancer drug class aberrant cancer metabolism . Under selective pressure , tumor plasticity allow sustain tumor growth long term despite exposure antiangiogenic TKIs , render mitochondrial metabolism essential survival When one energy source ( glycolysis ) pharmacologically limit , tumor become vulnerable inhibition ( mitochondrial metabolism ) . Pharmacological blocker nutritional stress regulator abrogate mitochondrial respiration tumor growth situation , investigator term `` metabolic synthetic lethality '' . The investigator hypothesize case antiangiogenics lead hypoxia normalization , chronic high-rate glycolysis offset tumor might switch alternative metabolic source . If source essential tumor survival , would open therapeutic opportunity . The administration ME-344 animal antiangiogenics induce mitochondrial phenotype seem promise . The investigator aim extend observation human . However , several question remain , prior launch large trial : - Which percentage patient experience mitochondrial shift expose give antiangiogenic . - In case happens , whether possible trace response accurately . - What benefit add ME-344 case show mitochondrial shift , benefit , , add remainder case . For purpose , investigator conduct pilot randomize phase 0 trial , cohort patient treat single bevacizumab dose prior surgery second cohort bevacizumab plus ME-344 . The purpose clinical trial evaluate addition ME-344 antiangiogenic agent case mitochondrial phenotype induce enhance antitumor activity .</detailed_description>
