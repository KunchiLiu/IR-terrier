	<brief_summary>This study assess role topical Ivermectin 1 % cream effect protease antimicrobial peptide expression rosacea . This single-site 16-week open label study University California , San Diego . The investigator first measure serine protease activity cathelicidin subject . All subject receive Ivermectin topical cream instruct apply daily 12 week . Participants return monthly visit clinical symptom facial redness number facial papule score , repeat tape strip . At end study , tape strip analyze determine serine protease activity participant visit expression cathelicidin ( LL-37 ) mRNA . The investigator look change serine protease activity LL-37 expression time , also determine whether change correlate disease severity .</brief_summary>
