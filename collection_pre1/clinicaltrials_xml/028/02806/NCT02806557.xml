	<brief_title>Profiling Neutrophil Counts Patients Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neutropenia low count type white blood cell fight bacterial infection . It common toxicity chemotherapy give cancer . When complicated infection , necessitate urgent admission hospital , life-threatening . Recovery neutrophils necessary prior delivery chemotherapy . The information available change neutrophil chemotherapy limited frequency blood test historically require venous blood sample hence burdensome patient . There point-of-care medical device measure white blood cell count capillary finger-prick sample , use patient 's home . The investigator aim use device trial to; ( ) observe change white cell count follow chemotherapy delivery , ( ii ) determine change white cell count early day chemotherapy use predictor severe neutropenia complication . This trial form part large project investigator explore role home blood count monitoring management severe neutropenia complication , explore potential home blood count monitoring use optimise dose intensity density chemotherapy . This non-randomised trial adult solid tumour , recruit Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust . Consenting participant require regular finger-prick blood test maximum frequency daily duration first cycle chemotherapy , commonly 3 week . A nurse visit participant home use Hemocue® WBC DIFF perform test . This trial fund Technology Strategy Board ( Innovate UK ) Small Business Research Initiative grant .</detailed_description>
