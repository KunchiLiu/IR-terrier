	<brief_summary>- Background : Asthma frequent disease characterize bronchial hyperresponsiveness , inflammation remodeling . Consistent epidemiological data indicate outcome asthma adult may determine early childhood . This may due bronchial remodeling , abnormal repair process contribute development poorly reversible airway narrow . It appear early natural history disease involve increase mass bronchial smooth muscle ( BSM ) . The mechanism increase related increase smooth muscle cell proliferation . Recently , demonstrate severe asthma , BSM increase proliferation induce enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis . Moreover , also show immature human , non-asthmatic airway smooth muscle cell ( ASMC ) proliferate great extent normal adult ASMC , similar fashion adult asthmatic ASMC . Immature ASMC may thus great potential stimulate airway remodel . We thus hypothesize remodel early process certain characteristic ASMC severe preschool asthma may predispose child persistent remodel airway obstruction later life . - Purpose : To investigate prognostic factor airway remodel preschool child , special attention ASMC proliferation ( mitochondrial mass &amp; biogenesis ) . - Methods : In initial phase project , 75 severe asthmatic preschool child ( &lt; 5 yr ) prospectively recruit `` CHU de Bordeaux '' `` CHU de Toulouse '' accord `` Haute Autorité de Santé '' criterion . Inclusion visit include write informed consent , asthma control evaluation , clinical examination , lung function test ( exhaled NO , plethysmography ) , prick test , chest X Ray blood sample total IgE level . Bronchial specimens subject obtain fiberoptic bronchoscopy visit 2 . Airway remodel evaluated morphological analysis . After smooth muscle mitochondrion analyze electronic microscopy &amp; immunoblotting . Comparison 2 group perform unpaired test parametric data x2-tests non-parametric data . In second phase project , patient followed-up till age 7-10 yr , another bronchoscopy biopsy perform .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Asthmatic child Parents ( possibly child ) give write informed consent . Affiliated social security scheme . Age 1 le 5 year . Severe persistent asthma accord criterion National Health Authority ( Annex I ) NEW PROPOSED CRITERIA ( adapt ATS ( 42 ) ) : Major criterion ( &gt; 1 ) Asthma control mild moderate level require 1 . A continuous semi continuous ( ≥ 50 % year ) oral corticosteroid 2 . A treatment high dos inhale corticosteroid ( &gt; 500 microgram / day Beclomethasone , equivalent ( &gt; 400 microgram / day Budesonide , &gt; 200 microgram / day Fluticasone ) least 6 week . And minor criterion ( &gt; 2 ) 1 . The need additional daily treatment ( β2agonists , longacting , theophylline , antileukotrienes ) 2 . Symptoms require take daily almost daily β2agonists short action 3. persistent obstruction ( FEV &lt; 80 % PEF variability &gt; 20 % ) ( If reliable spirometry , usually &gt; 5 year age ) 4 . One seek care emergency / year 5 . At least three short course oral corticosteroid / year 6 . Rapid Increases cause decrease 25 % dose oral corticosteroid inhale 7 . ATCD severe acute asthma put lifethreatening Nonasthmatic child Non asthmatic child indication endoscopy : Any endoscopy disease without acute chronic inflammation biopsy area ( ≥1 &lt; 5 year ( 1st part ) : congenital stridor , double aortic arch , foreign body removal inhale , ... ; ≥ 7 ≤ 10 year ( 2nd component ) : inhale foreign body removal , ... ) . Parents ( possibly child ) give write informed consent . Affiliated social security scheme . Children asthmatic postmortem ( retrospective prospective ) Age 1 5 ( 1st part ) age 7 10 year ( 2nd part ) death Died without pulmonary pathology sample area Non asthmatic child thoracic surgery : Age 1 5 ( 1st part ) age 7 10 year ( 2nd part ) . Subject pulmonary pathology , require thoracic surgery lobectomy , noninflammatory sample area . Parents ( possibly child ) give write informed consent . Affiliated social security scheme . Asthmatic child : Subject severe exacerbation asthmatic disease require hospitalization 3 week precede inclusion . exclusion period topic compare another protocol . Subject significant comorbidity associate asthma nature whatsoever bronchial malformation ( exclusion criterion ex post ) . Subject dental infection , nasopharyngeal airway ( viral bacterial ) fever ( &gt; 39 ° C ) 4 week precede survey . chronic viral infection ( hepatitis , HIV ) . nonspecific inclusion criterion endoscopy : Review hemostasis abnormal , Subject heart condition , Subject fast 6 hour . Children without asthma : Nonasthmatic child indication endoscopy : asthma diagnose doctor . exclusion period topic compare another protocol . Subject significant comorbidity associate asthma nature whatsoever . bronchial malformation ( exclusion criterion ex post ) . Subject dental infection , nasopharyngeal airway ( viral bacterial ) fever ( &gt; 39 ° C ) 4 week precede survey . chronic viral infection ( hepatitis , HIV ) . nonspecific inclusion criterion endoscopy : Review hemostasis abnormal , Subject heart condition , Subject fast 6 hour . Children postmortem nonasthmatics : asthma diagnose doctor . Subject dental infection , nasopharyngeal airway ( viral bacterial ) fever ( &gt; 39 ° C ) within 4 week sample tissue . chronic viral infection ( hepatitis , HIV ) .
