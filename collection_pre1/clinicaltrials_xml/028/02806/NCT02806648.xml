	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically proven diagnosis pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNET ) Ki67 assessment &lt; = 20 % ( well moderately differentiate ) evidence unresectable disease metastatic disease . Locally advanced disease must amendable resection radiation therapy curative intent . 2 . Overexpression Cdk4 and/or phosphoRb1 and/or cyclin D1 tumor tissue sample tumor biopsy prior primary tumor resection ( Molecular study conduct CNIO logistic describe later ) . Therefore availability paraffinembedding tumor tissue sample need . 3 . Documented progression disease CT scan , MRI , Octreoscan within 12 month prior baseline . 4 . Previous treatment chemotherapy , antiangiogenics , interferon permit provide toxicity resolve &lt; grade 1 study entry last treatment least 4 week prior baseline assessment . Patients may treat somatostatin analogue trial . Concomitant interferon treatment permit . 5 . Measurable disease per RECIST . Measurable lesion previously radiate consider target lesion unless increase size observe follow completion radiation therapy . 6 . Able swallow oral compound 7 . Male female , 18 year age old . 8 . ECOG performance status less 2 . 9 . Life expectancy great 12 week . 10 . The definition minimum adequacy organ function require prior study entry follow . In addition , safety precaution provide product labeling anticipate control arm chemotherapy must observe . Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT 5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlie malignancy Total serum bilirubin 1.5 x ULN Serum albumin 3.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1500/L Platelets 100,000/L Hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL Creatinin clearance &lt; 40 mL/min 11 . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . 12 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 1 . Prior chemotherapy regimen biological treatment locally advance metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urinary tract . 2 . Prior treatment Cdk4 inhibitor clinical trial . 3 . Creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min use Cockroft Gault formula . 4 . Major surgery , radiation therapy , systemic therapy within 3 week study randomization except palliative radiotherapy nontarget metastatic lesion . 5 . Prior highdose chemotherapy require hematopoietic stem cell rescue . 6 . Immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , longterm oral glucocorticoid take concurrently within last 3 month prior randomization 7 . Prior radiation therapy &gt; 25 % bone marrow . 8 . Current treatment another clinical trial . 9 . Uncontrolled brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease . Patients complete surgery radiation therapy exist brain metastasis , document increase size previous 3 month prior first dose treatment study asymptomatic . 10 . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 3 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . 11 . Any follow within 12 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolus . 12 . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade 2 , atrial XML File Identifier : 3xAP+CVEwV9UnEoC7xvloFQA/XQ=Page 20/34 fibrillation grade , QTc interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470msec female . 13 .
