	<brief_summary>This vivo study design acquire human gastrointestinal ( GI ) physiology data healthy subject fast fed condition necessary mechanistic absorption model development . Up 30 subject enrol study . Each subject ask complete two GI tube insertion procedure . Subjects complete study twice condition GI tract , either fast state fed state , order provide intra-subject variability . A minimum 7 day separate GI tube insertion procedure . The objective study , follow : Objective # 1 : To acquire human GI physiology data include GI motility , pH GI fluid , GI fluid volume fast fed condition ; Objective # 2 : To measure drug concentration calculate drug dissolution GI tract vivo fast fed condition ; Objective # 3 : To monitor plasma drug concentration evaluate pharmacokinetics administer drug GI tube insertion study fast fed condition . These vivo result use validate vitro dissolution method support computational mathematical modeling effort , order develop oral drug product optimization process may apply future drug maximize oral drug safety efficacy .</brief_summary>
