	<brief_summary>The exist scientific evidence vitro clinical trial support notion polyphenols modulate platelet function . Beyond central player haemostasis thrombosis , platelets crucial role development atherosclerosis , mediate interaction monocytes endothelial cell . Disturbed platelet function correlate risk factor , include hypertension obesity , progression cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , postulate platelet rational target CVD prevention . Thus , effect polyphenols disturbed platelet function would contribute pleiotropic beneficial effect cardiovascular health . Aronia juice rich source polyphenols include anthocyanins , procyanidins , phenolic acid flavonols . However , clinical evidence effect aronia juice consumption platelet function relate CVD factor . The purpose study investigate effect Aronia juice polyphenols platelet function CVD risk factor subject moderate CVD risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Aronia Juice Polyphenols Cardiovascular Disease Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate effect Aronia ( Aronia melanocarpa L. ) juice polyphenols platelet function CVD risk factor three-arm , crossover design , randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial perform apparently healthy subject moderate CVD risk . Recruited participant randomly assign one three intervention ( pure Aronia juice , Aronia beverage placebo beverage ) first phase follow cross-over second third phase . Two-week run-in period low intake polyphenols precede start intervention , ie . first intervention phase . During three intervention period ( phase ) subject consume 100 ml intervention product daily 28 day , 28 day wash period different phase . Blood urine sample take baseline , 28 day intervention period . Platelet analyse flow cytometry , biochemical analysis plasma sample , full blood count , blood pressure anthropometric measurement perform study visit . During first study visit , regardless allocation , blood sample take 2h consumption first 100 ml intervention product ( performed experimental site ) analysis marker platelet function , biochemical parameter ( glucose , triglyceride , uric acid ) blood pressure assess . Subjects instructed avoid rich-sources anthocyanins procyanidins whole study . Dietary habit assess food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) perform 2 time begin end study 24h-recall perform begin wash period .</detailed_description>
