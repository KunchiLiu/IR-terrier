These community ( n =168 ) stratify base sub-district median community population size sub-district . Four community randomly select sub-district : two large two small community . These 24 community randomly assign active passive radio engagement . Each community consider cluster . To achieve total sample 1258 caregiver , 52 woman per cluster enrol . If researcher unable enroll sample size one community , cluster expand include close village enrolment continue sample size achieve . Enrolment strategy . A census community complete 2013 used decide selection strategy . Field worker priori randomly select 52 household cluster ( one mother per household , randomly choose &gt; 1 ) . If select household child &lt; 5 age , close house approach . This continue enrolment complete . Data Collection Procedures Phase 1 : Baseline survey A baseline survey carry document prevail IYC feed knowledge , attitude practice caregiver use semi-structured questionnaire . Questions cover : - socio-demographic information - radio ownership listen practice - exposure source nutrition education district - IYC feed knowledge practice - knowledge awareness anaemia - knowledge awareness undernutrition - knowledge , attitude practice water , sanitation , hygiene Phase 2 : Formative research The formative research begin active engagement community . The total sample formative research 144 woman child 5 year age 144 men child 5 year age , 144 elderly woman take care child 5 year age . Participation solicit community-wide meeting explain project . Interested individual include sample size reach . Written inform consent obtain note . Participation formative research include : ( ) Farm Radio International ( implementers mass medium program ) carry focus group determine belief , attitude , constraint prevent caregiver adequately feed infant young child . In addition , information radio-listening habit , time preference programme , formats interest community collect . Information gather used design radio nutrition health message jingle directly address IYC feeding challenge area . Three focus group discussion undertake 12 active radio engagement community . The focus group include 8-12 individual , follow group : ) woman child 5 year age ii ) men child 5 year age iii ) elderly woman take care child 5 year age ( grandmother , great aunt ) ( ii ) These participant focus group follow take part monthly quarterly assessment radio program use semi-structured questionnaire . The aims assessment : ) obtain feedback community member improve content radio message , ii ) determine whether message receive intended , iii ) ass intermediary adoption message Phase 3 : Intervention The interactive radio education intervention involve weekly radio program local radio station key nutrition health topic 18 month . The topic consistent Ministry Health 's community nutrition health education message . The programme repeat every week . The intensity intervention individual differ base assignment participant 's community : See description active passive arm . Phase 4 : Post-intervention survey An endline survey carry within maximum 3 month end mass medium intervention , determine effect intervention IYC feed sanitation knowledge , attitude practice caregiver . The question cover : - recollection key message ( free recall-no probe ) - self-reported level engagement radio program - exposure source nutrition education district - IYC feed knowledge practice - knowledge awareness anaemia - knowledge awareness undernutrition - knowledge , attitude practice water , sanitation hygiene The endline survey complete 1258 woman participate baseline survey . Data Analysis Focus Group Data All recording focus group discussion transcribe local language ( Krobo Twi ) English analyze use N-Vivo version10 . The thematic content analysis approach use analyze data . Common theme emerging discussion group result summarize base theme . Selected quote participant also present . Change baseline self-reported knowledge , attitude practice . All analysis intention-to-treat basis . Analyses perform individual level summary use difference-in-difference ( DiD ) approach . For target knowledge , attitude behavior , report prevalence estimate baseline endline , difference survey calculate . ANOVA test use detect difference caregiver infant young child feed knowledge , attitude practice intervention group control group adjust important baseline characteristic effect cluster .</detailed_description>
