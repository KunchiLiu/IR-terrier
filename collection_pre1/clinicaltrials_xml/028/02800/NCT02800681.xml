	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify psychopathology ( psychiatric symptom ) differentiate Schizotypal Disorder ( SD ) Asperger Syndrome ( normal IQ , language impairment Autism Spectrum Disorder ) ( AS ) young adult . With present knowledge , differentiation AS SD difficult , present social difficulty , odd ( psychotic ) behaviour , 'feeling everyone else ' . Studies suggest adult AS symptom either overlook , diagnose within schizophrenia spectrum Adult Psychiatry . A 'correct ' diagnosis important , first step towards optimal plan , treatment rehabilitation patient . The way diagnose psychiatric illness description present psychopathology . To identify symptom differentiate two disorder , use semi-structured interview explore present psychopathology young adult typical symptom SD AS respectively , special focus presence alteration self-experience . Alterations self-experience typical schizophrenia spectrum , therefore think equally present AS SD . The hypothesis total level alter experience higher SD , AS , different pattern alter experience SD AS . If hypothesis true , examination alter self-experience valuable aid clinical differentiation two disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychopathological Differences Between Asperger Syndrome Schizotypal Disorder Adult Sample</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : SD non-psychotic disorder within Schizophrenia Spectrum ( ICD-10 ) , prevalence 3.9 % adult sample . Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) , pervasive developmental disorder ( include AS ) , prevalence 1 % . SD typically diagnose young adult , whereas AS typically diagnose childhood . Sometimes however , AS symptom first become invalidate young adulthood , social demand exceed individual 's capacity . In case , patient symptoms correspond AS , might first diagnose young adult . In Adult Psychiatry though , experience diagnose ASD scarce , study suggest adult patient present symptom correspond AS , either overlook , diagnose within schizophrenia spectrum . Psychiatric diagnosis : Description present psychopathology way diagnose psychiatric illness . An accurate diagnosis crucial relevant treatment rehabilitation plan individual patient , diagnosis guide help support offer . Further , properly guide neuro-psychiatric research , high diagnostic accuracy imperative . This study refer diagnostic criterion define ICD-10 , include participant , ICD-10 principal diagnostic system Denmark . Altered self-experience : Alterations self-experience consider highly specific schizophrenia spectrum , therefore think present equal amount and/or distribution ASD . If true , examination anomalous self-experiences would valuable aid clinical differentiation SD AS . For patient altered self-experience , experience him-/herself subject disturbed . This mean form structure ( rather content ) patient ' thought experience alter . Aim , objectives hypothesis : The aim depth exploration difference present psychopathology ( psychiatric symptom ) young adult SD AS . This elaborate refine understand SD AS specifically , ASD schizophrenia spectrum disorder general . The objective ; 1 . Explore difference psychopathology young adult SD AS , 2 . Contribute general specific ( SD AS respectively ) description autism concept . The hypothesis ; 1 . The total level alter experience ( EASE total score ) high SD AS , 2 . The pattern occur altered experience ( individual EASE item ) different AS , compare SD . Material method : The study observational comparative design , include 100 participant ; 50 diagnose SD , 50 AS . The included subject medical history revise two senior psychiatric consultant , ensure identification participant typical symptom . Further , include participant assess three semi-structured psychopathological interview , general symptom functional score self-reports . Co-ratings : All study interview videotape , subset tap SCAN EASE interview co-rated within research group . Co-ratings also routinely perform amongst psychologists The Danish Autism Centre , conduct ADOS interview . Statistical analysis : To investigate group difference , group wise comparison SCAN algorithm , ADOS algorithms EASE outcomes apply . Further , secondary correlation across psychopathological domain explore , explorative cross-diagnostic factor analysis perform . Ethical consideration : Prior inclusion differentiate informed consent obtain participant .</detailed_description>
