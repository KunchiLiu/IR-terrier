	<brief_summary>For past 130 year , appendectomy standard treatment appendicitis . Recent study Europe challenge notion surgery best option , show antibiotic alone treat appendicitis without need appendectomy many 3 4 patient without safety issue one year follow . Despite result , remain determined antibiotic strategy good appendectomy outcomes patient care . The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) -funded Comparison Outcomes Drugs Appendectomy ( CODA ) trial first American , largest-ever randomized trial issue result help surgeon patient make inform healthcare decision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparison Outcomes Antibiotic Drugs Appendectomy ( CODA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Comparison Outcomes Antibiotic Drugs Appendectomy ( CODA ) trial aims test , patient 's perspective , antibiotic strategy `` good '' surgery . The investigator believe patient , clinician , people pay healthcare ( patient insurer ) find antibiotics approach acceptable 1 ) result high rate treatment success , 2 ) increase complication , 3 ) provide equivalent well patient experience . A large-scale non-inferiority trial expect result change management one common human illness . If non-inferiority demonstrate ( superiority antibiotic approach identify ) , find improve patient choice support shift less invasive approach . If non-inferiority establish , result may help delineate trade-offs two treatment approach inform decision-making . The observation patient acute uncomplicated appendicitis ( AUA ) cure antibiotics-alone scientific rationale . Traditionally , appendicitis think result blockage appendix , leave untreated , inevitably lead perforation . Contrary physiologic model , Carr demonstrate obstruction appendix unlikely primary cause majority patient cause enteric infection . A recent randomized trial find increased rate appendectomy early use compute tomography ( CT ) image diagnostic laparoscopy , case report appendicitis remission document serial CT suggest leave appendix place inexorably lead clinical compromise . A common concern clinician consider treat AUA antibiotic remove appendix may lead perforation complication complicate appendicitis . Evidence suggest , however , perforate appendicitis pre-hospital event non-perforated appendicitis `` different '' disease . This theory support general lack relation delay surgery 24-36 hour perforation rate . Most recently , Fusobacterium sp. , genus enteric Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria , rather obstructive stone , find correlate presence appendicitis degree inflammation . What remain determined whether certain bacterial colony feature individual immune response associate progression appendicitis without appendectomy whether successful outcomes people undergo antibiotic predict base patient 's characteristic . An additional rationale study address limitation prior trial . To avoid misclassification problem trial , patient undergo standard radiographic image include CT , ultrasound ( US ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Patients appendicolith include trial consider unique subgroup evaluate part pre-specified analysis ( potentially exclude future recruitment early analysis demonstrate futility related primary antibiotic approach successful ) . To reflect usual emerge technique treatment , study include type appendectomy ( open laparoscopic ) broad range antibiotic strategy include option `` outpatient '' treatment schedule daily dose longer-acting agent . Patients antibiotics arm give minimum 24 hour intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic ( use appropriate dosing schedule base patient 's ability tolerate oral medication ) , follow oral antibiotic total 10 day antibiotic treatment ) . Discharge hospital emergency department ( ED ) change treatment arm guide clinical target reason change treatment arm assess . Patients follow two year ass longer-term complication , eventual appendectomy ( perform anywhere ) , quality life ( QoL ) , gastrointestinal symptom , decisional regret . To quantify selection bias promote generalizability , patient approach study refuse randomization characterize baseline . A parallel cohort patient refuse randomization ( 250 initiate antibiotic strategy 250 select appendectomy strategy ) survey two year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult ≥18 year ; 2 . Clinical diagnosis acute uncomplicated appendicitis ( AUA ) establish clinical care team , support follow usual care radiological test ( compute tomography ( CT ) , ultrasound ( US ) , and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) . AUA define usual sign , symptom , image find appendicitis without : 1 . Diffuse peritonitis clinical exam ( i.e. , rigid abdomen / four quadrant peritonitis ) ; 2 . Radiologic finding : . Free air ; ii . Walled fluid collection concern abscess ; iii . Significant amount intraabdominal fluid throughout abdomen ( i.e. , trace fluid ) ; iv . Extent inflammation adjacent organ involvement radiologic image appendectomy relatively contraindicate . 3 . Ability provide write electronic informed consent English Spanish . 1 . 1 . Unable unwilling return contact clinical followup visit and/or research survey ; 2 . Currently incarcerate detention facility police custody ( patient wear monitoring device enrol ) baseline/screening ; 3 . Evidence severe sepsis septic shock ( e.g. , new presume sepsisrelated organ dysfunction , elevated lactate , and/or fluid unresponsive hypotension ) ; 4 . Conditions alter immune response risk bacterial seeding ; 5 . Immunodeficiency ( e.g. , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3 , chronic immunosuppressive drug , active chemotherapy plan chemotherapy follow 30 day , know acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) [ cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count &lt; 200 AIDSdefining illness within last year ] assessed patient history ) ; 6 . Uncompensated liver failure ; 7 . Taking medication treat active inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis ) ; 8 .

Patients another infection ( e.g. , pneumonia , urinary tract infection ) require treatment another antibiotic baseline/screening ; 14 . Concurrent illness would otherwise mandate hospitalization outside appendicitis associate symptom baseline/screening ; 15 . Imaging finding follow : 1 . Appendiceal softtissue mass ; 2 . Imaging feature mucocele tumor ( e.g. , appendix measure ≥ 15mm diameter CT evidence appendicitis ) ; 3 . Concern carcinomatosis imaging ; 16 .
