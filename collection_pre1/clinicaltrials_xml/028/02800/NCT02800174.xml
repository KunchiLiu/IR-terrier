	<brief_title>Smart Nitinol Stent System Treatment Severe Atherosclerotic Carotid Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis lead cause carotid artery stenosis . The risk atherosclerosis increase age , occur mainly middle-aged elderly population . The morbidity mortality stroke cause atherosclerosis also increase age . An epidemiologic study demonstrate carotid artery intima-media thickness marker atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease , find evidence likelihood clinical diagnosis atherosclerosis increase two- threefold 20 90 year age . The risk atherosclerosis also increase age animal feed atherosclerosis-inducing diet . The close relationship atherosclerosis age show atherosclerosis chronic progressive degenerative disease . Atherosclerotic carotid stenosis independent risk factor ischemic cerebrovascular disease . Vascular stenting carotid artery stenosis increasingly popular technique . It safe , quick , minimally invasive , perform local anesthesia , use treat proximal intracranial lesion . Vascular stenting enables flow restore previously narrow vessel , restore blood supply brain prevent plaque rupture . Carotid artery stenosis 70 % -90 % consider high risk stroke , compel indication stenting . The Smart stent system ( Cordis Corporation , Miami , FL , USA ) nitinol self-expanding stent soft , elastic , uniform radial tension readily endothelialized . Phatouros et al . treat four patient carotid artery stenosis &gt; 70 % use self-expanding Smart stent &lt; 20 % residual stenosis achieve case ; transient ischemic attack new stroke occur follow period 6 month . Drescher et al . also use self-expanding Smart stent 13 patient severe carotid artery stenosis find complication 6-month follow-up period . Wholey et al . deployed stent treat carotid artery stenosis 500 patient , find rate neurologic complication restenosis decrease application either balloon-mounted self-expanding stent . Three-year follow-up result show balloon-mounted stent lead good vessel patency self-expanding stent , balloon-mounted stent vulnerable compression . Lownie et al . examine efficacy self-expanding Smart stent 21 patient severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis ( stenosis &gt; 70 % ) without angioplasty . All patient follow average period 19 month . Self-expanding Smart stent improve vascular stenosis blood flow without need balloon adjunctive protection device . Zhao et al . use Smart stent treat patient carotid artery stenosis &gt; 65 % , find treatment safe effective , observe severe complication . Li et al . treated patient carotid bifurcation origin stenosis &gt; 50 % self-expanding Smart stent , find patient ' neurologic function improve different extent , stroke transient cerebral ischemic attack subsequent period 13-14 month . Chen et al . use self-expanding Smart stent treat 48 patient carotid artery stenosis 75 % -99 % , achieve favorable clinical outcome 43 ( 89.6 % ) , recurrence stenosis relatively short follow-up period 1-6 month , postoperative complication sequelae . In cohort 38 patient extracranial artery ( internal carotid artery outer segment , vertebral artery subclavian artery ) stenosis treat Smart stent follow average 18 month , satisfactory clinical outcome achieve 33 ( 86.8 % ) . These investigator also treat another cohort 41 patient carotid artery stenosis Smart stent , conclude vascular Smart stent deployment effective safe method treat carotid artery stenosis . No long-term randomized control trial evidence regard use Smart nitinol stent system treatment atherosclerotic carotid stenosis currently exist . This study non-randomized control trial , deployment Smart nitinol stent system compare conservative management platelet aggregation inhibitor group patient severe atherosclerotic carotid stenosis subsequently follow 2 year . Adverse event Possible adverse event associate Smart stent implantation include vascular spasm , bradycardia , hypotension , luxury perfusion syndrome , intraoperative thrombosis thrombus detachment , ischemic stroke , intraoperative hypertension , postoperative hypotension hypoglycemia . If adverse event occur , detail event include date occurrence , measure take related treatment , causal relationship treatment treatment adverse event report principal investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access All data collect case report form collate . Collated data input electronic database use double-data entry strategy train professional staff . Information accuracy check recruited patient follow . The database lock researcher charge alter . All information relate trial preserve Beijing Jishuitan Hospital , China . The electronic database fully disclose professional statistician statistical analysis . Anonymized trial data publish www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician blind group use SPSS 14.0 software . Normally distributed measurement data express mean Â± standard deviation , numeration data frequency . The two sample t-test rank sum test use compare mean measurement data stent implantation drug group . The chi-squared test use compare numeration data group . Multivariate regression analysis use compare mRS score 2 year treatment . Kaplan-Meier Cox Proportional Hazards Survival regression analysis use examine survival time survival state . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Frequency measure monitor trial implementation Trial progression report ethic committee Beijing Jishuitan Hospital , China every 6-12 month trial 's status update registration database . Confidentiality principle The electronic database preserve dedicate password-protected computer manage data management professional . Data record paper preserve secure , locked place future viewing .</detailed_description>
