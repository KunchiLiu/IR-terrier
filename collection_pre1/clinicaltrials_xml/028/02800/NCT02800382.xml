	<detailed_description>Lipid per oxidation final product free oxygen radical think initiator role develop cancer body . Level paraoxonase patient cancer varies . In research , investigator investigate contribution level serum bronchoalveolar lavage paraoxonase differentiation benign malignant lung disease patient . This research include patient diagnosis lung cancer ( research group ) benign pulmonary disease ( control group ) participate accepted fiberoptic bronchoscopy ( FOB ) . Paraoxonase Cancer Relations Oxidative stress one important etiologic factor carcinogenesis . Serum PON1 activity find significantly low patient lung cancer healthy people Elkiran friends et al . Also , gastroesophageal cancer , meningioma , high-grade glioma ovarian epithelial find significantly low tumour patient accord control group plasma . The relationship serum PON1 level occurrence cancer still unknown . PON1 polymorphism report related increase risk occurrence cancer relation environmental chemical . Reactive oxygen radical usually lead tissue damage attack cell component . Increased free oxygen radical oxidative stress form body one important risk factor increase various type cancer . Lipid peroxidation 's final product scavenger system component think starter role oncogenesis . Carcinogenic radical liposoluble form result lipid peroxidation PON1 bind radical liposoluble . PON1 think capable metabolize radical liposoluble . PON1 activity oxidative stress suggest inversely relate serum macrophage . Loss paraoxonase protective effect may play role increase sensitivity genomic damage inflammatory oxidant diet carcinogen cause . Purpose research compare serum bronchoalveolar lavage liqs PON contrast patient lung cancer control group determine enzyme low plasma bronchoalveolar lavage liqs case malignant .</detailed_description>
