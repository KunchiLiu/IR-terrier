	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study Pixantrone Monotherapy Pediatric Patients With Relapsed Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately thirty-five eligible patient receive six 28-day cycle pixantrone monotherapy , two additional cycle patient continue benefit treatment . Each patient receive pixantrone administer intravenously day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . There three age cohort , define age cohort 1 ( 12 less 18 year , plus young adult ( age 18-21 year ) ) , age cohort 2 ( 5 less 12 year ) , age cohort 3 ( 6 month le 5 year ) . During dose escalation , three patient first accrue start dose level . If DLTs identify , dose level declare exceed MTD three patient accrue next high dose level . Each subsequent dose-escalation level accrue per DLT/MTD determination schema . Planned sequential dose-escalation phase receive 40 mg/m2 , 50 mg/m2 , 60 mg/m2 70 mg/m2 pixantrone base ( day 1 , 8 15 ) , tolerate , base DLT evaluation.Dose escalation follow standard 3+3 patient cohort escalation plan . No patient Age Cohort 3 enrol 6 patient age cohorts 1 2 ( combine ) evaluable toxicity . After MTD determine , expansion phase accrue order gain well estimate safety , tolerability , anti-tumor activity pixantrone monotherapy pediatric patient treat MTD . Patients offer 3 year post-study extension phase follow-up periodic assessment cardiac function parameter .</detailed_description>
