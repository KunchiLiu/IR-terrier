	<brief_summary>This research study carry study new way possibly treat human cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) without invasion . Persistent infection specific type human papillomavirus ( HPV , frequently type 16 18 ) may lead precancerous lesion ( CIN ) . If untreated , lesion may progress cervical cancer within many year . In infected cell , HPV express oncoproteins E6 E7 , play key role maintain viral infection promote carcinogenesis . Previous study demonstrate E7 alone , E6 , sufficient immortalize human keratinocytes vitro induce high-grade cervical dysplasia transgenic mouse model . These data indicate E7 may dominate malignant progress HPV-infected cell . The agent zinc finger nuclease ( ZFNs ) , call ZFN-603 ZFN-758 , cleave HPV16 HPV18 E7 oncogene specifically . ZFN-mediated disruption HPV16 HPV18 E7 DNA directly decrease expression E7 , induce type-specific apoptosis HPV16- HPV18-positive cell , inhibit cell growth . The purpose study determine whether ZFN-603 ZFN-758 effective treatment HPV16- HPV18-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laboratory study show ZFN-603 ZFN-758 could induce significant cleavage E7 DNA HPV16- HPV18-positive cell . The disruption viral DNA directly lead downregulation E7 expression restoration tumor suppressor gene retinoblastoma 1 ( RB1 ) , result apoptosis growth inhibition ZFN-treated HPV16- HPV18- positive cell line . On basis laboratory result , potential may work human infected high-risk HPV ( especially HPV16 HPV18 ) block progression CIN The new treatment study involve transfecting ZFNs HPV-infected cervical epithelials . Cells modify ZFN-603 ZFN-758 lose ability immortalization progress apoptosis . Researchers hope agent able block malignant progression CIN reduce incidence cervical cancer</detailed_description>
