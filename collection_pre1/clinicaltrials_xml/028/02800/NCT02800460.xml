	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) validate procedure , use many French international center treatment severe form Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The improvement parkinsonian motor symptom stimulation STN 50 80 % average . The main advantage DBS surgery low morbidity mortality , adaptable patient 's symptom effect reversible . This treatment routine 85,000 patient worldwide benefit installation system . Since 1997 , treatment available patient follow Pitié Salpêtrière ( GHPS ) . The quality implantation stimulate electrode deep brain structure achieve , particularly NST PD patient , crucial obtain excellent result . Accurate identification deep nuclei especially NST MRI patient operate essential step directly affect smooth run surgery final clinical outcome . The visualization NST MRI remain difficult , variable patient , require specific sequence even sequence dedicate activity . In GHPS investigator opt realization efficient particular sequence view NST latter several disadvantage first duration . Indeed , patient need keep still , head fix 40 minute , major constraint sometimes impossible due importance abnormal movement . The second variability patient visualization sometimes inconspicuous . The third susceptibility sequence flow artifact level third ventricle significantly disrupt view NST . The new MRI technique available year , especially 3 Tesla allow good visualization deep nucleus brain NST particular . Indeed , high-field MRI become indispensable tool define morphological structural feature also functional metabolic deep nucleus brain , particularly NST . The accuracy preoperative anatomic target stereotactic neurosurgery improve use high-field MRI . However , several new issue inherent high-field MRI evaluate image use directly . The chosen sequence must short feasible , minimize patient discomfort , evaluate several patient ensure low interindividual variability . In addition , quality display section provide reliable three-dimensional information . Finally , quality target possible improvement check .</detailed_description>
