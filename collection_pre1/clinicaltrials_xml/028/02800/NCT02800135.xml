	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common disorder associate high morbidity mortality . However , distinguish transient AKI persistent AKI may help individualize treatment limit short long term consequence AKI . Previous study suggest usual urinary index perform poorly separate transient persistent AKI unselected population critically ill patient . The recent KDIGO ( Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ) guideline underline need additional strategy estimate renal short term prognosis . Recently , Furosemide stress test ( FST ) validate cohort unselected critically ill patient . This stress test performance find good predicting capacity identify patient progress advance stage AKI . Additionally , FST performance high usual renal biomarker . The limited sample size preliminary study however preclude adjustment usual confounders include oliguria . The primary objective study assess diagnostic performance FST differentiate transient persistent AKI . Secondary objective assess diagnostic performance FST predict need renal replacement therapy , confirm FST result adjustment confounders .</brief_summary>
