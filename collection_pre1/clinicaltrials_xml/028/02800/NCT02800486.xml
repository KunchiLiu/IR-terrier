	<brief_summary>Primary brain tumor typically treat surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy , either individually combination . Present therapy inadequate , evidence low 5-year survival rate brain cancer patient , median survival approximately 12 month . Glioma common form primary brain cancer , afflict approximately 7,000 patient United States year . These highly malignant cancer remain significant unmet clinical need oncology . GBM often high expression EFGR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) , associate poor prognosis . Several method inhibit receptor test , include monoclonal antibody , vaccine , tyrosine kinase inhibitor . The investigator hypothesize patient recur GBM , intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion Cetuximab ( CTX ) , dose 250mg/m2 conjunction hypofractionated radiation , safe efficacious prevent tumor progression patient recurrent , residual GBM .</brief_summary>
