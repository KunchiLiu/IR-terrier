	<brief_summary>The ongoing research bipolar disorder ( BD ) highlight pervasive debilitating nature , characterize lifelong recurrent episode residual intraepisodic symptomatology . Epidemiologic , comorbidity , cost-of illness , mortality study report dramatic illness-associated morbidity premature mortality bipolar patient . The efficacy safety antidepressant drug treatment BD subject long-standing debate base scientific literature limit inconsistent . The evidence base use antidepressant drug BD strikingly weak , insufficient evidence treatment benefit antidepressant combine mood stabilizer . The need develop new agent treatment depression , particular bipolar depression , good efficacy and/or tolerability , remain unmet . In past year increase interest health benefit supplemental and/or dietary substance treatment prevention depression . The disaccharide trehalose protects cell hypoxic anoxic injury suppresses protein aggregation . In vivo study trehalose show cellular behavioural beneficial effect animal model neurodegenerative disease . Moreover , trehalose show enhance autophagy , process recently suggest involved therapeutic action antidepressant mood-stabilizing drug . In fact , trehalose may antidepressant-like property trehalose induced behavioral change possibly relate trehalose effect enhance autophagy . Furthermore , preliminary data indicates trehalose also augments lithium effect animal model ( mouse ) . Based hypothesis , project aim conduct study assess efficacy tolerability trehalose adjunctive treatment lithium bipolar depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This investigator-initiated parallel group pilot study . All patient give sign informed consent prior initiation study procedure . Study setting : This unicentric pilot study carry Bipolar Disorder Programme Hospital Clinic , University Barcelona . Over 700 Bipolar Disorder patient currently treat Bipolar Disorders Program Hospital Clinic University Barcelona , tertiary center provide integrate care patient specific catchment area well difficult-to-treat bipolar patient derive Spain , already describe elsewhere . Patients consider enrolled study sign inform consent . Patients consider randomized assign receive either trehalose maltose . It expect least 60 patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio trehalose 70g placebo ( maltose 70g ) . Patients receive economic compensation participation study . Patients evaluate baseline week 2 , 4 6 . At baseline , patient receive explanation regard study ; sign informed consent patient interview study psychiatrist administer study scale M.I.N.I . International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus ( MINI-Plus ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Hamilton Rating scale Depression ( HAMD ) , Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder ( CGI-BP ) , World Health Organization-well ( WHO-wb ) , Functioning Assessment Short Test ( FAST ) , Cognitive complaint bipolar disorder rating assessment ( COBRA ) . Furthermore , patient undergo routine blood analysis include glycaemia , thyroid function ( T3 , T4 , TSH ) well lithaemia , baseline week 6 . At week 2 4 patient administer MADRS , HAMD , CGI-BP , WHO-wb FAST scale , eventual side effect record . At week 6 , patient interview MADRS , HAMD , CGI-BP , FAST administer side effect record . At final visit ( week 6 ) , patient undergo clinical interview , follow administration MADRS , CGI-BP , WHO-wb , COBRA FAST scale . Full blood analysis perform .</detailed_description>
