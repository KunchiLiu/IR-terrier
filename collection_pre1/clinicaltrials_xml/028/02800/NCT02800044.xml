	<brief_title>Studying Effectiveness Non-Invasive Glucose Sensors Patients With Diabetes : The SENSOR Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) facilitate hinder adherence patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . Readings provide real-time information hypoglycemic hyperglycemic excursion . These data crucial successfully manage disease , SMBG help guide decision titrate medication , potentially encourage patient engagement . There drawback . Piercing skin check glucose several time day uncomfortable obtrusive patient DM . SMBG offer snapshot patient 's glucose time test . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) reveal glucose trend . A subcutaneous sensor transmits interstitial glucose reading approximately every five minute . Yet , sensor insertion require needle . Patients still must test SMBG 4 time per day calibrate CGM sensor . This modality less accurate low rapidly rise glucose . CGM also widely available , due cost insurance issue . A non-invasive glucose monitor , GlucoWatch , discontinue due problem accuracy tolerability . Compounding challenge surge number individual DM . Every 19 second , American 20 year age old diagnose DM . If current trend continue , 1 3 Americans could DM 2050 . There thus unmet need non-invasive glucose monitoring device . UCSD nanoengineers develop flexible , ultra-thin sensor adherent skin , similar temporary tattoo . Preliminary data seven individual without DM demonstrate correlation glucose measurement sensor glucometer . Evaluating sensor patient DM critical : hour-to-hour blood glucose fluctuate approximately 50 % throughout day without DM , may vary 10-fold patient DM . This study would first examine sensor individual DM . The investigator hypothesize compare glucometer , tattoo sensor accurately measure glucose patient DM .</detailed_description>
