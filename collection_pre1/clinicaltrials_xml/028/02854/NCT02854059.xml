	<brief_title>IdeS Asymptomatic Asymptomatic Antibody-Mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme Streptococcus pyogenes ( IdeS ) IgG specific endopeptidase cleaves IgG molecule efficiently neutralize Fc-mediated activity . IdeS-mediated IgG degradation constitutes novel therapeutic principle treatment IgG-driven human disease . In addition assess safety tolerability IdeS study also assess efficacy IdeS significantly increase ADAMTS13 activity decrease anti-ADAMTS13 antibody level patient diagnose asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP low ADAMTS13 activity .</detailed_description>
