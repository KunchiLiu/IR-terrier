	<brief_summary>Prevalence neuropathic pain raise 6.9 % general population reach 58 % patient carry lesion spinal cord . This pathological condition stay major health problem , particularly efficacity available treatment currently limit . Only 30 40 % patient relieve 50 % pain pharmacological approach . In case failure , drug treatment addition one , stimulation motor cortex therapeutic path propose Tsubokawa since begin 1990s , find place neuropathic drug-resistant pain management since decade . Neurophysiologic mechanisms analgesic efficacity motor cortex stimulation still little understood . This stimulation realise chronic invasive way implant electrode . This process allow last relief half operate person , without possibility identify clinical selection criterion reliable potentially respond patient technique . Recently , two electrophysiological non invasive technique develop , allow get analgesic stimulation motor cortex : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) direct current transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tDCS ) . The main goal study compare importance analgesic effect tDCS chronic drug-resistant neurophysiologic pain one get thanks reference method stimulation non invasive motor cortex , rTMS whose analgesic effect already validate data literature .</brief_summary>
