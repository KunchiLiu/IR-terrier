	<brief_title>Safety Study EF-022 Adults With Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis ( RRP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology RRP associate local immune suppression disease-involved site . EF-022 , Vitamin D-Binding protein Macrophage Activating Factor , modulate innate arm immune system alleviate immune suppression . The investigator hypothesize EF-022 may modulate immune response manner might slow even prevent disease progression . Adult subject treat weekly EF-022 period 6 month either intramuscular subcutaneous administration . The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability EF-022 administer adult subject recurrent respiratory papillomatosis either IM SC . The main response assessment perform 6 month period : - Evaluating lesion size and/or number disease-involved site Coltera-Derkay score - Assessment degree voice disorder use VHI-10 score - Symptomatic assessment dyspnea/stridor</detailed_description>
