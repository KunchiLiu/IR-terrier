	<brief_summary>The propose study continuation research program ( STU00017005 : Interventions teach melanoma patient skin self-examination ) design increase early detection melanoma metastasize . In 2015 , approximately 73,870 individual U.S. diagnose invasive melanoma 9,940 die disease . During 2002-2011 , melanoma incidence increase average annual rate 1.6 % men 1.5 % woman . People history melanoma 10 time great risk develop second primary melanoma relative general population.Early detection surgical excision earlier stage treatment usually effective proven curative strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The complete R01 demonstrate preliminary evidence melanoma survivor partner skin self-examination ( SSE ) train program result regular accurate SSEs relative patient partner receive treatment usual care . However , one caveat patient partner well-controlled study potentially cue conduct SSEs follow training reinforced action . Whereas `` real-world '' condition participant would see dermatologist less frequently significantly less cueing conduct SSEs . This research address limitation examine long-term influence SSE training SSE knowledge , self-efficacy , performance , accuracy real-world condition melanoma patient treatment group ongoing R01 study relative control ( Aim 1 ) . In addition , continuation study also examine intervention work best real-world condition ( Aim 2 ) . Findings clinical RCTs behavioral intervention involve patient rarely , ever , examine determine generalizability real-world setting . The current proposal contribute critical information scientific literature impact early detection melanoma use SSEs first test sustainability long-term impact efficacious SSE intervention early detection target melanoma survivor real-world setting .</detailed_description>
