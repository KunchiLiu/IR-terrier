	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study design test accuracy photoplethysmography diagnose change vascular resistance anesthesia . The investigator study 50 mechanically ventilated patient undergo general anesthesia . Photoplethysmography continuously record right thumb anesthesia . Duplex color power Doppler measure flow radial artery right hand.The contour analysis , photoplethysmogram radial artery flow analyze , correlate compare use Bland-Altman plot .</detailed_description>
