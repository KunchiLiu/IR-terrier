	<brief_summary>In 2006 , Weinberg propose hypothesis iron accumulation risk factor osteoporosis . Osteoporosis common complication various disease , hemochromatosis , African hemosiderosis , thalassemia , sickle cell disease , share iron accumulation common denominator . Moreover , 3-year retrospective longitudinal study show iron accumulation also associate osteoporosis healthy adult especially increase risk fracture postmenopausal woman . Based observation , iron chelation therapy may promise future treatment iron accumulation-related osteoporosis remove iron body . The purpose study determine whether addition iron chelator , deferasirox , standard therapy postmenopausal osteoporosis , safe effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Deferasirox-calcium-vitamin D3 Therapy Postmenopausal Osteoporosis ( PMOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmenopausal osteoporosis ( PMOP ) systemic bone metabolism disease , characterize progressive bone loss follow menopause subsequent increase fracture risk . Estrogen deficiency result menopause know increase bone resorption accelerate bone loss . Furthermore , postmenopausal woman may exhibit iron accumulation , addition estrogen deficiency . Elevated iron level risk factor PMOP postmenopausal woman , reduce iron overload iron chelators demonstrate benefit bone cell metabolism vitro improve bone vivo normalize osteoclastic bone resorption formation . Although safety efficacy deferasirox evaluate iron-overloaded patient extensively , data iron-accumulated postmenopausal woman , let alone iron-accumulated postmenopausal woman osteoporosis . Therefore , currently plan dose , confirm safety efficacy essential current study lay groundwork future phase III clinical trial . This prospective , phase II , randomize , open label , placebo-controlled study calcium-vitamin D3 plus deferasirox vs. calcium-vitamin D3 postmenopausal osteoporosis . Ten postmenopausal woman diagnose osteoporosis DXA , accompany iron accumulation ( serum 500ng/ml≤ferritin≤1000ng/ml ) , randomize receive calcium-vitamin D3 plus deferasirox calcium-vitamin D3 ( n = 5 per arm ) . The primary objective determine safety tolerability adjunctive deferasirox therapy postmenopausal woman treat calcium-vitamin D3 osteoporosis , obtain exploratory data efficacy iron chelation treatment . The reduction iron level deferasirox may provide viable therapeutic option mitigate iron accumulation associate PMOP .</detailed_description>
