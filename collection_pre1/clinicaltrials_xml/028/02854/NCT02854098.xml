	<brief_summary>Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome group inherit abnormality structure connective tissue , manifest disturbance proportion collagen . The main symptom syndrome include : laxity joint capsule ligament , hypermobility joint , well numerous disturbance function internal organ contain connective tissue , include gastrointestinal tract . Hypermobility joint affect approximately 10 % population Western country , common small child female . Modified Beighton scale basic scale assess hypermobility joint . The scale ( assessed use goniometer ) reliable tool evaluation excessive laxity connective tissue child . Functional constipation common condition , affect approximately 3-5 % child adolescent , peak onset 2 4 year age . The etiology disorder multifactorial , till day still exactly unknown child develop constipation , others observe correct scheme defecation . Suspending stool enhances retention fecal mass , subsequently cause painful defecation . Diagnosis base history , clinical symptom physical examination . Increased susceptibility wall distal gastrointestinal tract could explain predisposition child retain fecal mass development constipation . Due unclear etiology functional constipation , seem reasonable conduct study assess whether excessive laxity connective tissue ( assessed basis hypermobility joint ) facilitate accumulation stool large intestine , one reason lead development functional constipation child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comorbidity Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome Functional Constipation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical question : Is among patient functional constipation increase percentage child Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome , compare population healthy child ? In discussion would like determine whether excessive laxity connective tissue promote development functional constipation child . Description study : 1 . Anamnesis physical examination patient 2 . The consent parent patient ( &gt; 15 year ) participate study 3 . Determining whether patient meet criteria inclusion study 4 . The exclusion patient meet exclusion criterion study - basis anamnesis physical examination ( include neurological ) diagnostic test ( biochemical electrolyte TSH - , Na , K , Ca , P , Mg ) , indicate 5 . In patient classified study , degree laxity connective tissue assess basis modify Beighton scale 6 . In control group - patient without constipation interview - degree laxity connective tissue assess basis modify Beighton scale 7 . Evaluation result . Rome III Criteria Functional Constipation Diagnostic criterion must include one month child 4 year age two month old child ( insufficient criterion diagnosis IBS ) least two follow : 1 . Two few defecation per week 2 . At least one episode/week incontinence acquisition toileting skill 3 . History excessive stool retention 4 . History painful hard bowel movement 5 . Presence large fecal mass rectum 6 . History large diameter stool may obstruct toilet Accompanying symptom may include irritability , decrease appetite , and/or early satiety . The accompany symptom disappear immediately follow passage large stool . Modified Beighton scale Hypermobility joint indicate ≥ 4 point 9 possible . The Beighton score measure add 1 point following : 1 . Placing flat hand floor straight legs 2 . Left knee bend backward ( &gt; 10 ° ) 3 . Right knee bend backward ( &gt; 10 ° ) 4 . Left elbow bend backward ( &gt; 10 ° ) 5 . Right elbow bend backward ( &gt; 10 ° ) 6 . Left thumb touch forearm 7 . Right thumb touch forearm 8 . Left little finger bend backward ( &gt; 90 ° ) 9 . Right little finger bend backward ( &gt; 90 ° )</detailed_description>
