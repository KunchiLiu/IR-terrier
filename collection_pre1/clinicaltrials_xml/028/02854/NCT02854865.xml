	<detailed_description>For normal cardiac performance , leave ventricle ( LV ) must able eject adequate stroke volume arterial pressure ( systolic function ) fill without require elevate left atrial ( LA ) pressure ( diastolic function ) . These systolic diastolic function must adequate meet need body . Systolic function conveniently ( although always accurately ) measure ejection fraction ( EF ) , calculate stroke volume divide end-diastolic volume . Diastolic function difficult evaluate characterize change leave ventricular ( LV ) fill dynamic . The mean LA pressure source pressure LV filling . Determining LV filling pressure key element diagnosis management patient suspect decompensated heart failure . Measurement pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) Swan-Ganz catheter become gold standard determine LV filling pressure . Invasively measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) widely use surrogate leave ventricular filling pressure ( LVFP ) directly associate functional capacity prognosis patient heart failure . On hand , invasive procedure produce complication , especially critically ill patient randomize clinical study find benefit use Swan-Ganz catheter manage critically ill patient . Thus , effort find noninvasive method determine LV filling pressure continue . One basic non-invasive parameter reflect LVFP ratio peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity ( E ) peak early diastolic velocity mitral annular motion ( Ea ) derive conventional pulsed-wave Doppler tissue echocardiography . The E/Ea ratio find superior individual Doppler tissue imaging ( DTI ) parameters conventional pulsed-wave Doppler parameter assess LV fill pulmonary venous flow predict increase LVFP assess patient prognosis . However , DTI inherent limitation may negative impact accuracy Ea measurement . Specifically , DTI angle-dependent , affect tethering , myocardial translation , respiration motion . Recently , 2-dimensional speckle track echocardiography ( 2DSTE ) introduce measurement systolic diastolic strain strain rate ( SRs ) above-mentioned limitation . Since echocardiographic study evaluate LVFP perform transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) cardiological set primarily diastolic 2D-STE parameter describe , aim present study ass whether systolic 2D-STEderived parameter , global longitudinal peak systolic strain ( GLPSS ) , acquire transoesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) superior E/Ea ratio estimation LVFP measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) patient cardiac surgery . Automated function image ( AFI ) algorithm novel method base 2D strain imaging enable simultaneous quantification myocardial strain different leave ventricular segment ; 3-click method minimizes variability relate manual tranig endocardial border require usual 2D-strain analysis . AFI provide GLPSS average mid-oesophageal 4- , 2- chamber long axis view . The study prospective observational single-center cohort study . Patients schedule elective cardiac surgery include study group . Written inform consent obtain patient surgery . 30 consecutive patient schedule elective cardiac surgery meet exclusion criterion . The study design ass whether GLPSS measure cardiac surgery use AFI 45 consecutive patient superior E/Ea ratio estimation LVFP measure PCWP .</detailed_description>
