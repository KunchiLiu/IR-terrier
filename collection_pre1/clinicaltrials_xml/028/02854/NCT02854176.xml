	<detailed_description>Worldwide , 9.6 % men 18 % woman age 60 year suffer osteoarthritis ( OA ) , involve knee . Within OA patient population , 80 % OA patient limitation movement , 25 % perform majority daily activity ( WHO ) . OA progressive articular cartilage disorder involve motor sensory dysfunction , include decreased range motion , muscle weakness , impaired proprioception , pain . Some symptom contribute arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) , reflexive decrease motor output muscle surround affect joint likely mediate GABAergic inhibitory mechanism . AMI characterize abnormal afferent information transmit central nervous system , result altered afferent feedback quadriceps motoneuron ( MN ) turn result reduce excitability particular pool . The altered afferent input suggest stem stimulation mechanoreceptors , via joint effusion excessive movement , nociceptors response pain , loss joint receptor . Although evidence concern role central nervous system scarce , pre- postsynaptic spinal mechanism directly affect alpha-MNs seem affect . Dysfunction γ-loops also seem involve . These mechanism together result AMI manifest aberration voluntary quadriceps torque , force control , reflex excitability often measure H-reflex . Motor dysfunction thus important limit factor OA patient involve motor sensory factor . Besides evident role motor efferent , sensory afferent also influence motor control poor proprioceptive function predictive poor chair-stand performance . Reduction sensory deficit could potentially increase motor function knee OA . The present study aim evaluate whether low-intensity peripheral electrical nerve stimulation , form increase afferent input , could potentially improve OA patient ' motor function . The limiting factor OA patient , however , pain , experience rest movement . High-frequencies stimulation paradigm normally use reduce pain , 40-50 minute low-frequency electrical stimulation ( 4 Hz , &lt; MT intensity ) also effective reduce pain rest , pain movement , pain sensitivity , although recent systematic review question consistency effect consider limited evidence . Although , best knowledge , clear physiological explanation concern pain reduction peripheral electrical nerve stimulation , possible reduction experience pain mediate reduced analgesia , i.e. , decrease excitability nociceptive neuron . Electrical stimulation peripheral nerve muscle apply various form modulate muscle strength , motor skill , spinal- cortical excitability . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) evoke force generate torque 112 % maximal voluntary contraction force increase increase stimulation frequency 70-80 Hz . Whereas NMES primarily focus increase muscle strength , low-intensity somatosensory electrical stimulation ( SES ) use increase motor skill acquisition neurologic patient healthy participant . SES excite group Ia , Ib , II afferent , well secondary muscle afferent fiber . SES increase motor performance apply peripheral nerve high sensory intensity ( 2-3 time perceptual threshold ) 10 Hz ( SES apply 1 Hz train consist 5 pulse 10 Hz ) . High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) sensorimotor train reposition error reflect impaired knee proprioception patient knee OA . Both TENS SES thus excite afferent fiber involve knee proprioception . Impaired knee proprioception associate impaired ability accurately steadily control force impaired eccentric strength . In contrast NMES , induce increase muscle force likely involve change metabolism , hypertrophy , possibly spinal mechanism , TENS , large diameter primary afferent pivotal pain reduction , SES target sensory pathway , cutaneous proprioceptive , seem appropriate target reduce sensory deficit involve OA . SES improve stroke patient ' motor function whether improvement occur patient knee AO unknown . Excitation primary afferent SES could serve physiological basis hypothesis SES positively influence afferent input α-MN quadriceps muscle surround dysfunctional joint reduce pain . The increased afferent input SES , show previously healthy participant stroke patient , expect increase motor control , measure increase track performance dysfunctional knee joint . As task variant visuomotor tracking , force steadiness accuracy expect increase SES measure associate proprioception , outcome SES know improve excitation muscle afferent . If expectation correct , SES could use future study rehabilitation protocol primer potentiate effect NMES exercise therapy design improve quadriceps strength power . Second , SES reduce pain increase motor control , SES possibly postpone surgery serve adjuvant patient patient unsuitable resist total knee replacement improve activity daily therefore quality life . Therefore , present study examine acute delayed effect 60 minute SES ( five pulse 1 Hz train 10 Hz motor threshold intensity ) femoral nerve patient suffer knee OA . Figure 1 depicts schematic overview propose study design . As initial step , pilot experiment 5-6 healthy individual reveal whether effect trend observe 30 minute SES , duration probably would optimal 60 minute consider 120 minute standard use improve neurological patient ' hand function . The primary outcome study motor coordination evaluate use target track base knee position base quadriceps force , position vs. force less affected influence pain therefore suitable current context . Secondary outcome motor control proprioception reflect increased force steadiness accuracy , maximal voluntary strength daily physical function . The investigator hypothesize base previous data afferent input induce SES reduces abnormalities sensory input result OA , therefore increase motor control .</detailed_description>
