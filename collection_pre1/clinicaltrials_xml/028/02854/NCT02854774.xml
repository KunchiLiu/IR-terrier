	<brief_title>Neural Mechanisms Muscle Control Individuals With Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Two prior randomize control trial ( RCT ) highlight importance hip muscle activation strengthen treatment strategy patellofemoral pain ( Khayambashi , 2014 ; Khayambashi , 2012 ) . Here , propose pilot study acquire preliminary data power large study reveal neural mechanism underlie effectiveness intervention promote evidence-based incorporation clinical practice . Intervention : 4 week quadriceps muscle versus 4 week hip strengthen exercise . Purpose : To determine change brain functional connectivity relate pain reduction induce strengthen exercise . Study population : Males females history unilateral knee pain . Methodology : Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use quantify functional connectivity brain region related hip muscle activation . Functional connectivity quantify ( pre ) ( post ) 4 week quadricep hip muscle strengthen exercise . Arms : As , 2 arm . 4 week quadriceps strengthen exercise ( Arm 1 ) versus 4 week hip strengthen exercise ( Arm 2 ) . Outcomes : At pre post-intervention session participant , quantify brain functional connectivity hip muscle motor cortex 1 ) thalamus , 2 ) basal ganglion , 3 ) insula , 4 ) periaqueductal gray . We also quantify self-report pain biomechanical function knee hip . Follow-up : A six month follow-up plan pilot study . Analysis Plan Statistics : Functional connectivity hip muscle motor cortex extract use standard statistical software brain mapping . A repeated measure ANOVA use assess change functional connectivity hip knee group . Pain decrease group quantify report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pain locate specifically around patellofemoral articulation ( vague localize ) . 2 . Readily reproducible pain ( 3 10 visual analog scale ) least 2 follow functional activity commonly associate PFP : stair ascent descent , squat , kneel , prolonged sitting , isometric quadriceps contraction . 3 . Reports pain great 3 month duration . 1 . Previous history knee surgery . 2 . History traumatic patellar dislocation . 3 . Neurological involvement would influence gait . 4 . Contraindications MR imaging : implant electronic device ( i.e . pacemaker ) , metallic implant ( i.e . aneurysm clip , fixation screw ) .</criteria>
