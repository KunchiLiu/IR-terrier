	<brief_summary>Traditionally , BXO manage circumcision ( surgical removal foreskin ) approach long hold 'gold standard . Whilst may curative many case , show 20 % boys require operative procedure penis widen urethral opening ( treat meatal stenosis ) An alternative circumcision propose : preputioplasty ( surgery widen opening foreskin ) combine injection steroid affect foreskin . Subsequently , group compare outcomes technique circumcision , report circumcision successfully avoid 92 % preputioplasty group . In addition , rate meatal stenosis ( narrow urethral opening require surgery ) significantly low ( 6 % vs 19 % , P = .034 ) . Preputioplasty may therefore : ( ) offer protection meatal stenosis reduce requirement surgery ; ( ii ) offer benefit retain foreskin , function , debate , likely include sexual function . In view potential benefit , author call randomised trial compare circumcision preputioplasty injection steroid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circumcision Versus Preputioplasty BXO Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention compare operation treat BXO call : ( ) circumcision : standard surgical circumcision whereby prepuce ( foreskin penis ) excise cut edge outer prepuce sutured cut edge inner prepuce . The two study team member perform surgery trial ( HC SK ) free choose method circumcision ( e.g . guillotine vs. sleeve ) think influence outcome . The foreskin sent histological analysis . ( ii ) preputioplasty intralesional injection triamcinolone . Briefly , longitudinal incision place area phimosis , suture transversely allow prepuce become retractile . A biopsy area affect foreskin sent histological analysis . The intention perform three incision ( tri-radiate ) final decision many make operate surgeon base appearance prepuce result initial incision ( ) . Once prepuce felt freely retractile , 1 - 3 mL triamcinolone ( Adcortyl Bristol-Myers Squibb 10 mg/mL ) inject intradermally around circumference affect foreskin use 25-gauge needle . These procedure establish treatment BXO currently use trial surgeon set trial.The preputioplasty injection triamcinolone procedure previously approve Alder Hey Children 's Hospital NHS Trust Clinical Development Evaluation Group ( CDEG ) .</detailed_description>
