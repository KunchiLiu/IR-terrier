	<brief_summary>Stroke one lead cause death disability China . Intravenous thrombolysis recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) improve outcome ischemic stroke patient treat within 4.5 hour symptom onset . In China , addition rt-PA , intravenous urokinase within 6 h also recommend 2010 Chinese Guidelines Diagnosis Treatment Patients Acute Ischemic Stroke , support evidence two intravenous urokinase thrombolysis trial . Urokinase use frequently rt-PA , mainly cheap . To describe Chinese experience thrombolytic therapy Ischemic Stroke within 4.5h onset , design multicenter , prospective , registry study . The aim INtravenous Thrombolysis REgistry Chinese Ischemic Stroke within 4.5 h onset（INTRECIS）was assess safety efficacy intravenous rtPA , urokinase thrombolytic therapy within first 4.5 h onset acute ischaemic stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Thrombolysis Registry Chinese Ischemic Stroke Within 4.5 h Onset</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRECIS prospective multicenter registry use data 60 centre North China . Consecutive patient acute ischemic stroke treat intravenous rtPA , urokinase within 4.5 hour symptom onset 60 centre North China eligible registry . Patient involvement registry shall influence treatment decision . Patients undergo complete diagnostic work include clinical neurological examination use National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score , laboratory examination , brain neurovascular imaging , echocardiography , 24-hours ECG . Clinical outcome evaluate day 1 day 14 use National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score , evaluate 3 month use modified Rankin Scale score ( mRS ) assess adverse event . The proportion patient favourable outcome ( mRS 0 2 ) 3 month treatment serve primary outcome measure . Secondary outcome measure include unfavourable clinical outcome ( mRS 3 6 ) , NIHSS report mortality .</detailed_description>
