	<brief_summary>The main purpose study assess efficacy safety BT595 adult subject chronic ITP . The primary objective study determine rate subject response . A response define platelet count ≥30×10^9/L least 2 fold increase baseline count , confirm least 2 separate occasion least 7 day apart , absence bleeding . The secondary objective study , addition efficacy assessment , evaluate safety BT595 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Diagnosis chronic ITP ( &gt; 12 month ' duration ) , include diagnosis refractory ITP , define International Working Group ( Rodeghiero et al , 2009 ) , ITP describe autoimmune disorder characterize isolated thrombocytopenia absence cause disorder may associate thrombocytopenia Treatment indicate high risk bleed need raise platelet count Mean screen platelet count &lt; 30×10^9/L 3 qualify platelet count perform within approximately 7 14 day start treatment , individual platelet count 35×10^9/L . The subject may rescreened mean screen platelet count ≥30×10^9/L . ( Note : If subject rescreened , screen laboratory test must repeat . ) Main Secondary thrombocytopenia acquire medical condition know associated secondary thrombocytopenia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ; lymphoma ; multiple myeloma ; thyroid disease ; form thrombocytopenia , drug induce thrombocytopenia ; cirrhotic liver disease ; antiphospholipid syndrome ; environmental thrombocytopenia ; bone marrow diseases Severe concomitant diseases judgment investigator interfere study , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , acute renal failure , noncontrolled arterial hypertension Laboratory finding ( e.g. , abnormal laboratory value hemoglobin , transaminase level [ alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase ] , total bilirubin , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , immunoglobulins G , A , M ) preclude participation Positive Coombs test ( direct indirect ) Planned invasive procedure time frame study Maintenance therapy intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIgs ) infusion IVIgs within 3 month start study Unresponsive previous IVIg treatment Additional therapy high dose corticosteroid ( equivalent &gt; 30 mg prednisone/day ) , thrombopoietin receptor agonist , and/or immunosuppressive and/or therapy ( e.g. , infusion platelet ) within 1 month start study ( Note : Subjects stable dos ITP active treatment must modify dose precede 2 week must maintain prestudy dose study . Corticosteroids give premedication . Rescue therapy short course [ i.e. , 1 4 day ] high dose steroid IVIgs allow 2 week study inclusion . ) History thrombotic event ( include myocardial infarction , cerebral vascular accident [ include stroke ] , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis ) 6 month treatment start BT595 presence significant risk factor thrombotic event Therapy live attenuate virus vaccine 3 month start study Selective , absolute immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency know antibody IgA</criteria>
