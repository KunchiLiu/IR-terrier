	<detailed_description>Emergency contraception ( EC ) provide woman additional line defense unintended pregnancy follow act unprotected intercourse . Orally-dosed EC work delay ovulation reduces risk pregnancy single act unprotected intercourse 50-70 % . Unfortunately , obese woman significantly likely normal BMI counterpart experience failure orally-dosed EC instance EC equivalent placebo . Our preliminary data provide evidence test dose escalation strategy effort provide improve efficacy orally-dosed EC obese woman . We hypothesize increase dose orally-dosed EC agent normalize pharmacokinetics result expected treatment effect ( delay follicle rupture ) obese woman . In overall proposal , plan perform detailed pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study UPA-based EC obese woman expand upon preliminary finding LNG-based EC . This protocol registration UPA aspect study procedure focus pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics UPA include dose escalation intervention .</detailed_description>
