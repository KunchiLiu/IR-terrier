	<detailed_description>It already show increase certain marker stress , prolonged elevation CRP absence bacterial infection , increase free cortisol serum copeptin , associate excess mortality cirrhosis . MPs membrane vesicle variable size 0.1 1 .mu.m , release extracellular space follow activation cellular apoptosis . MPs also find circulate blood healthy volunteer plasma level rise certain disease increase thrombotic risk , cancer . Their membrane compose antigen whose organization characteristic parent cell negatively charge phospholipid , phosphatidylserines , confer pro-coagulant property MPs . Currently , work MPs increase follow discovery involvement physiological process proliferation , differentiation , cell activation immune response certainly pro-thrombogenic power study . Recent study also implicate MPs pathophysiology chronic liver disease . Cirrhotic patient elevate concentration MPs leukocytes , endothelial cell hepatocytes compare control subject , concentration MPs increase worsen liver function . Increasing MPs cirrhosis may relate one hand decrease clearance secondly excess proinflammatory cytokine increase phenomenon intestinal bacterial translocation . The assumption role systemic inflammation training MPs reinforce existence significant correlation original MPs hepatocyte buffy endothelial CRP Thus , increase MPs observe increase PH could increase risk thrombosis intestinal microcirculation lead enterocytic suffering ischemic , reflect increase serum concentration I-FABP ( intestinal fatty acid bind protein ) . This suffering enterocytes lead increase intestinal bacterial translocation ultimately increase formation MPs . These MPs could also worsen liver function phenomenon thrombosis hepatic microcirculation .</detailed_description>
