	<brief_title>Study Lanreotide Patients With Metastatic Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Who Are Undergoing Liver-directed Radioembolization With Yttrium-90 Microspheres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , prospective , multi-center Phase II study patient metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumor , include typical carcinoid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , candidate liver-directed radioembolization . Lanreotide ( Somatuline® Depot ) Injection , FDA-approved treat unresectable , well- moderately-differentiated , locally advanced metastatic gastroentero-pancreatic neuro-endocrine tumor ( GEP-NETs ) improve progression-free survival . Radioembolization yttrium-90 microspheres ( SIR-Spheres® therapy ) FDA-approved treat liver metastasis colorectal cancer . While individual treatment promise result , investigator hypothesize treatment patient NETs optimize co-administration therapy . Patients receive treatment lanreotide ( 120 mg subcutaneously every 28 day ) combination SIR-Spheres therapy . The dose treatment day SIR-Spheres determine treat radiation oncologist . Patients currently receive previously receive lanreotide eligible , treatment lanreotide continue monthly disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Up 25 patient plan enrollment conduct approximately 5 investigational site U.S .</detailed_description>

Computerized tomography ( CT ) scan evidence liver metastases treatable surgical resection local ablation curative intent time study entry . If CT scan possible , MRI may use . Patients currently receive previously receive lanreotide another somatostatin analogue eligible . Previous treatment lanreotide another somatostatin analogue require study entry . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 1 . Adequate hematologic , hepatic renal function . Male patient female partner childbearing potential woman patient childbearing potential require use two form acceptable contraception , include one barrier method , participation study 3 month ( 90 day ) follow last dose study drug ( ) . Male patient must also refrain donate sperm participation study 3 month last dose study drug ( ) . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . Willingness ability comply study followup procedure . Ability understand nature study give write informed consent . Anticancer therapy exception lanreotide another somatostatin analogue within 21 day 5 halflives ( whichever short ) start study treatment . Wide field radiotherapy ( include therapeutic radioisotope strontium 89 ) administer ≤28 day limit field radiation palliation ≤7 day prior Cycle 1 Day 1 recover side effect therapy . Major surgical procedure ≤28 day begin study drug , minor surgical procedure ≤7 day . No wait require follow portacath placement . Previously untreated brain metastasis . Patients receive radiation surgery brain metastasis eligible therapy complete least 2 week prior study entry evidence central nervous system disease progression , mild neurologic symptom , requirement chronic corticosteroid therapy . Clinically significant ascites , cirrhosis , portal hypertension , thrombosis determine clinical radiologic assessment . Pregnant lactating . Acute chronic liver , renal , pancreas disease . Any following cardiac disease currently within last 6 month : Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 45 % determined Multiple Gated Acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) QTc interval &gt; 480 m screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Unstable angina pectoris Congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) ≥ Grade 2 Acute myocardial infarction Conduction abnormality control pacemaker medication Significant ventricular supraventricular arrhythmia ( patient chronic ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation absence cardiac abnormality eligible ) Valvular disease significant compromise cardiac function Inadequately control hypertension ( i.e. , systolic blood pressure [ SBP ] great 180 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) great than100 mmHg ) ( patient value level must blood pressure ( BP ) control medication prior start treatment ) . Currently receive treatment therapeutic dos warfarin sodium . Low molecular weight heparin allow . Serious active infection time treatment , another serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis B hepatitis C. Lab test result confirm treat physician prior study enrollment use patient 's record 1 year old . Presence active cancer , history treatment invasive cancer ≤5 year . Patients Stage I cancer receive definitive local treatment consider unlikely recur eligible . All patient previously treat situ carcinoma ( i.e. , noninvasive ) eligible , patient history nonmelanoma skin cancer .
