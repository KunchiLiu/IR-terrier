	<detailed_description>Prematurity first cause perinatal mortality morbidity worldwide . The threat premature delivery ( TPD ) , important complication lead cause hospitalization pregnancy multiple origin seldom precisely identify . In Belgium Europe , estimate rate premature birth 10 % . This rate stable last two decade spite introduction new tocolytic treatment use cervical length measurement transvaginal ultrasound ass risk preterm birth . The standard medical examination detection patient TPD endovaginal ultrasonographic examination uterine cervix ( echography ) . Ultrasound examination accurate reproducible compare cervical digital one , possess two essential quality diagnostic examination : easily accept patient learn curve fast . This technique validate well-known criterion , namely , shorten effective length open internal orifice cervix . The threshold two criterion depend practitioner 's choice : 30 mm effective length , sensitivity negative predictive value high , specificity poor , opposite true threshold set 20 mm . Ultrasound examination identification patient risk premature delivery real improvement cervical digital examination . However , technique ideal , due lack objective criterion choice threshold , imperfect correlation ( `` noise '' ) measure effective length uterine cervix time leave birth . Moreover , use cervical ultrasonography strategy premature delivery screen well established.Finally , transvaginal ultrasound probe available perinatal center would yet concern case preterm delivery . Gynaecologists focus use new low-cost diagnostic tool base optical imaging technology polarize light . The polarization spatio-temporal orientation wave 's electric field . This light property , invisible naked eye , sensitive morphological transformation tissue orientation collagen fiber . Such tool would require extensive training provide objective quantitative result sensitivity specificity great conventional ultrasonography . This would considerable contribution health care TPD , real societal problem Belgium , Europe world . The POLARMAP project propose possibility observe vivo pregnancy , structural evolution , density orientation change collagen fiber . During whole pregnancy end , cervix keep closed abundant well-organized collagen ( main structural protein cervical tissue ) , collagen partly destroy and/or disorganized onset labor . These change collagen structure , soften cervix allow open child birth , see premature full-term birth . A relevant scoring collagen status might thus provide alternative , potentially objective accurate quantifier time leave delivery .</detailed_description>
