	<brief_summary>Many patient neurological disease suffer neurogenic low urinary tract dysfunction ( NLUTD ) , often severely impairs quality life , due urinary urgency without incontinence void dysfunction . In addition , upper urinary tract may jeopardize high intravesical pressure cause detrusor overactivity concurrent detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia and/or low bladder compliance . The treatment NLUTD challenge since conventional conservative therapy often fail invasive treatment intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection , bladder augmentation urinary diversion consider . Neuromodulation therapies include tibial nerve stimulation ( TNS ) may alternative non-invasive treatment option . Indeed , TNS effective safe treatment idiopathic overactive bladder proven randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , value neurological patient unclear . In recent systematic review , investigator find evidence TNS might become promising treatment option NLUTD , however , reliable data well-designed RCTs urgently need reach definitive conclusion . However , investigator study first adequately sample power , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial assess transcutaneous TNS ( TTNS ) NLUTD . This trial provide significant insight efficacy TTNS patient suffer NLUTD case treatment really effective neurological population , investigator finding would completely revolutionize management NLUTD daily clinical practice . Moreover , interdisciplinary trial relevantly influence neurological urological approach management NLUTD promote future collaborative project improve patient ' medical care underlie pioneering role Switzerland rapidly develop ambitious research field neuro-urology .</brief_summary>
