	<brief_summary>The objective study characterize safety profile determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BXQ-350 , give single agent escalate dos , accord investigational product ( IP ) relate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) patient advance solid tumor . Secondarily assess preliminary antitumor activity BXQ-350 solid tumor recurrent high grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study BXQ-350 Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first man study BXQ-350 , novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent compose two component : Saposin C ( SapC ) , express ( human ) lysosomal protein , phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine ( DOPS ) , phospholipid locate cell membrane . When component assemble together form stable SapC-DOPS nanovesicles ( clinical formulation BXQ-350 ) , agent exhibit propensity enter body brain , target cell tumor mass , induce cell death . The study divide 2 part : 1 . Dose Escalation Scheme Sequential cohort adult patient advance solid tumor recurrent high-grade glioma treat escalate dos BXQ-350 MTD establish , absence MAD , high plan DL . 2 . During Part 2 , patient advance solid tumor recurrent high-grade glioma enrol administer BXQ-350 MTD determine Part 1 high plan DL , MAD reach .</detailed_description>
