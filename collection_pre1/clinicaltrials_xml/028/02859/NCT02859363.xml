	<brief_summary>Fabry disease X-linked disorder glycosphingolipid catabolism cause deficiency enzyme α-galactosidase A ( α-Gal A ) , lead progressive accumulation globotriaosylceramide ( Gb-3 ) plasma tissue lysosomes throughout body . Lysosomal accumulation result lysosomal cellular dysfunction , lead renal , cardiac , central nervous system ( CNS ) complication . It estimate 1 40,000 male Fabry disease , whereas estimate prevalence general population 1 117,000 people . Newborn screening classical atypical Fabry disease Taiwan also reveal markedly high incidence 1 2,300 1 3,000 newborn . Cerebrovascular variant Fabry disease may affect 4.9 % male patient 2.4 % female patient idiopathic stroke . The diagnosis Fabry disease challenge due diverse sign symptom , different age onset , variable timing severity progression . The importance Fabry disease lie irreversible renal , cardiac , cerebrovascular , neurological damage . An early diagnosis Fabry disease important initiate symptom management reduce life-threatening complication , well early identification affect family member . Therefore , present study would like conduct screen high-risk group early cerebrovascular involvement essential successful management Fabry disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional , population-based study identify Fabry disease patient early cerebrovascular involvement . Eligible patient age 18 year old ( &lt; =55 year old ) early cerebrovascular involvement provide inform consent . Patients diagnose Fabry disease eligible . The present study use sample early cerebrovascular involvement patient enrol two previous IRB approve project [ 103-3254C ( origin 98-3889A3 ) , 100-4008C ( origin 97-0470B ) ] , participant study consent participant ' sample could investigate need . Since , investigator ensure whether condition enzyme activity freeze plasma sample decay long-term storage investigator n't available normal range enzyme activity historical plasma sample , investigator perform specific genotyping Fabry disease patient accord specific mutation variant identify Taiwan population previously . Patients recall assess Fabry relate symptom genetic test mutation find family screening perform applicable . Further inform consent obtain well .</detailed_description>
