	<brief_title>Abdominal Compartment Syndrome Ruptured Aortic Aneurysm : Validation Predictive Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improved management technique rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm , especially vascular surgery , mortality rate decrease last year . The abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) clearly identify one main etiology mortality rupture aortic aneurysm . The mortality grow ACS population . So , investigator want screen abdominal compartment syndrome operative room . It observational study rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm abdominal compartment syndrome . aim study assess quality predictive score occurence syndrome surgery rupture aortic aneurysm Later aim future study screen ACS manage patient soon possible avoid .</detailed_description>
