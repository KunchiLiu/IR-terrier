	<brief_summary>Background : Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( RRP ) rare disease cause human papillomavirus . It cause voice change , airway compromise , pulmonary lesion , cancer . PD-L1 protein cell . It may able stop decrease immune system response viruses human papillomavirus . The drug Avelumab interfere activity PD-L1 . Researchers want see Avelumab treat RRP study side effect . Objective : To see Avelumab work treat RRP safe . Eligibility : People age 18 older aggressive RRP respond available treatment Design : Participants screen : Medical history Previously collect tumor tissue Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Endoscopy procedure : A small tube camera use look nose , throat , larynx , upper windpipe . Before start treatment , participant : Endoscopy anesthesia . A sample papilloma take . Voice handicap questionnaire CT scan Apheresis : An IV insert arm vein . White blood cell separate rest blood store research . The rest blood return IV one arm . Participants get study drug IV every 2 week 12 week . Participants repeat previous test throughout study . If respond treatment , participant evaluate every 6 week ( 3 time ) , every 12 week ( 3 time ) , every 26 week ( 2 time ) disease progress . Participants evaluate 30 day last infusion . They contact annually .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( RRP ) rare papillomatous disease aerodigestive tract cause Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) . - RRP progress cause airway compromise , fatal pulmonary lesion , invasive cancer . - There effective systemic therapy RRP . Patients require repeat interventional procedure disease control . - Study small number RRP sample show PD-L1 expression inflammatory mononuclear cell papilloma epithelial cell . - This clinical trial evaluate activity PD-L1-targeted drug , avelumab , treatment RRP . This drug select demonstrated activity variety cancer acceptable safety profile . Objective -Determine complete response rate avelumab treatment patient RRP . Eligibility - Histologically confirm diagnosis RRP . - One following : - A Derkay anatomic score 10 great history two endoscopic intervention last 12 month control RRP . - Pulmonary RRP pulmonary disease measurable compute tomography scan . - Tracheal involvement RRP require either two endoscopic intervention last 12 month tracheostomy . - Age 18 year great . - Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score 0 1 . Design - Phase II clinical trial - Simon optimal two-stage design initial enrollment 12 patient expansion 37 patient one complete response ( ) is/are observed initial patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : RRP CRITERIA : Histological diagnosis RRP confirm pathology report CLIAcertified laboratory . One following : A Derkay anatomic score 10 great history two endoscopic intervention last 12 month control RRP . Pulmonary RRP pulmonary disease measurable compute tomography scan . Tracheal involvement RRP require either two endoscopic intervention last 12 month tracheostomy . Greater equal 18 year age . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . Willing undergo endoscopic evaluation biopsy compliance protocol . No systemic therapy RRP four week prior treatment . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 14 day prior first dose : WBC &gt; 2000/microL Neutrophils &gt; 1500/microL Platelets &gt; 100 times10 ( 3 ) /microL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 30 mL/min ( measure calculate use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl : ( 140 age year ) time weight kg x 0.85/72 time serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl : ( 140 age year ) time weight kg x 1.00/72 time serum creatinine mg/Dl AST/ALT le equal 2.5 time ULN ; subject document metastatic disease theliver , AST ALT level less equal 5 time ULN Total Bilirubin less equal 1.5 time ULN Sexually active subject ( men woman ) subject reproductive potential must agree use two method contraception : one highly effective one effective method least 28 day prior , throughout avelumab treatment least 60 day avelumab treatment . Highly Effective Methods define : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) , tubal ligation partner vasectomy ; Other Effective Methods define : latex condom , diaphragm cervical cap . Seronegative HIV antibody . The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depend intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune function thus likely less responsive experimental treatment . Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , positive hepatitis B test evaluate confirmatory test ( Hep B DNA Quant , HBV Viral Load ) , confirmatory test negative , patient enrol . Seronegative hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen Hep C RNA Quant , HCV Viral Load HCV RNA negative . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition include recent ( within past year ) active suicidal ideation behavior ; laboratory abnormality , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy , interfere interpretation study result judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled , topical intranasal introocular steroid , adrenal replacement dos &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Prior organ transplantation , include allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway . Patients receive investigational agent Pregnant breast feeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define amenorrhea great equal 12 consecutive month . Note : woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression reversible reason . History allergy study drug component . History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ( Grade great equal 3 NCICTCAE v 4.03 ) , history anaphylaxis , uncontrolled asthma ( , 3 feature partially control asthma ) . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( great equal New York Heart Association Classification Class II ) , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy Grade &gt; 1 NCICTCAE v 4.03 ; however , alopecia , sensory neuropathy Grade le equal 2 Grade less equal 2 AEs constitute safety risk base investigator 's judgment acceptable . Known alcohol drug abuse . Vaccination within 4 week first dose avelumab trial prohibit except administration inactivate vaccine .</criteria>
