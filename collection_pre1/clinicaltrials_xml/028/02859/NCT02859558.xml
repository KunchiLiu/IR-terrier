	<criteria>Appropriate documentation medical record diagnosis acute HIV1 infection ( AHI ) within 7 day prior enrollment , include one following : 1 . A detectable HIV1 RNA within 28 day prior study entry AND nonreactive HIV1 antibody within 7 day prior entry OR 2 . A detectable HIV1 RNA reactive HIV1 antibody within 28 day prior study entry AND negative/indeterminate WB negative/indeterminate Geenius HIV1/HIV2 Supplemental Assay within 7 day prior entry OR 3 . A documented nonreactive HIV1 antibody negative HIV1 RNA within 90 day prior study entry AND document reactive HIV1 antibody positive WB negative p31 band positive Geenius HIV1/HIV2 Supplemental Assay negative p31 band within 7 day prior entry OR 4 . ARCHITECT GSCOMBO S/CO ≥10 within 7 day prior entry AND nonreactive HIV1 antibody within 7 day prior entry OR 5 . ARCHITECT GSCOMBO S/CO ≥1 within 7 day prior entry AND nonreactive HIV1 antibody within 7 day prior entry AND know prior S/CO &lt; 0.5 within 90 day prior entry OR 6 . ARCHITECT GSCOMBO S/CO &gt; 0.5 &lt; 10 within 7 day prior entry AND nonreactive HIV1 antibody within 7 day prior entry AND detectable HIV1 RNA within 7 day prior entry NOTE A : HIV1 RNA result must report FDAapproved assay . NOTE B : Since characterization Fiebig stage use sample time ART initiation perform result know within 12 week base standardized , centralized testing , estimate Fiebig group enrollment base inclusion criterion show table provide additional realtime monitoring accrual study group . The protocol team notify site criterion may longer use accrual complete certain Fiebig group . NOTE C : Specimens test specify may collect day study entry provide test result available prior enrollment . Ability willingness candidate provide write informed consent . Ability willingness initiate ART enrollment . Ability willingness participate schedule study visit 72 week . Female candidate reproductive potential pregnant time enrollment receive studyprovided EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF must agree participate conception process ( ie , active attempt become pregnant , vitro fertilization ) , participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female candidate must agree use least one reliable form contraceptive receiving studyprovided treatment . Female candidate consider reproductive potential follow condition apply : Candidate experience menarche . Candidate undergone bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy . Candidate experience menopause , define lack menstruation within precede 12 month . Acceptable contraceptive method include : Condoms ( male female ) without spermicidal agent Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide Intrauterine device Hormonal contraceptive Female candidate reproductive potential whose male partner ( ) document azoospermia require use contraceptive . Any statement selfreported sterility partner must enter source document . NOTE : Acceptable documentation lack reproductive potential oral write documentation individual . Female candidate prescribe nonstudyprovided ARV regimen discuss safety regimen conception pregnancy prescribe physician . Such individual follow medical guidance regard potential need contraception use nonstudyprovided ARV regimen . NOTE : Pregnant breastfeed woman may enroll study provide meet eligibility requirement access nonstudyprovided ARV regimen . Positive HIV1 antibody test ≥90 day prior study entry . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Any acute , chronic , recent clinically significant medical condition , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement jeopardize safety right participant . Receipt investigational study agent within 28 day prior enrollment Chronic recurrent use medication modify host immune response , eg , oral parenteral steroid , cancer chemotherapy . AHI diagnosis within 60 day receive investigational ARV HIV1 vaccine immune prophylaxis HIV1 infection . Use ARVs pre postexposure prophylaxis within 60 day prior diagnosis AHI . NOTE : The rationale exclusion minimize impact therapy primary endpoint .</criteria>
