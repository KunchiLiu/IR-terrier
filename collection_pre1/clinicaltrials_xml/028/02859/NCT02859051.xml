	<detailed_description>The primary aim determine impact use humanoid robot comparison standard care . This proposal describe first study world test novel technology preparation teach intervention IV insertion . This work build previous research conduct research team represent logical next step collaborative group . This project team include establish emerge leader pain management research . This ensure successful implementation completion project . These method teach preparation potential widespread application medical procedure clinical setting ( eg . oncology dentistry ) lead improve health outcome child ease suffer improve quality healthcare encounter . 1.2 Research Questions Research Question 1 . ) Does preparation administer humanoid robot ( MEDi ) reduce expectancy experience pain fear IV insertion child ? Hypothesis 1 . ) Children receive preparation MEDi report expect experience low level fear pain IV insertion compare youth receive standard care . Research Question 2 . ) Does preparation administer MEDi lead higher self-efficacy low anxiety parent child undergo IV insertion ? Hypothesis 2 . ) Parents child receive preparation MEDi report high level self-efficacy low anxiety child 's IV insertion compare youth receive standard care . Research Question 3 . ) Do child receive preparation administer MEDi parent accurate positively estimate memory pain fear compare youth receive standard care parent ? Hypothesis 3 . ) Children receive preparation administer MEDi parent report accurate positively estimate memory pain fear compare youth receive standard care parent . Research Question 4 . ) Do child receive preparation administer MEDi prior IV insertion parent expect experience less pain , fear , anxiety , high self-efficacy pain cop future needle procedure compare youth receive standard care parent ? Hypothesis 4 . ) Children receive preparation administer MEDi prior IV insertion parent report expect experience low pain , fear , anxiety high self-efficacy pain cop future needle procedure compare youth receive standard care parent . 2.1 Study Design &amp; Setting This study single-centre prospective randomize , control , two-armed trial : ( 1 ) humanoid robot , MEDi , provide preparation intravenous placement ; ( 2 ) standard care . Patients recruit day surgery Alberta Children 's Hospital Calgary , AB . This study follow high methodological standard report RCTs accord Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials guideline - extension nonpharmacological treatment trial register clinicaltrials.gov . 2.2 .
