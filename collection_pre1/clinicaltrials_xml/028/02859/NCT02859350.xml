	<detailed_description>EGSPZV2 single center , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . The study take place Baney Temporary Research Facility ( BTRF ) locate Baney City . One hundred thirty-five healthy male female ; adult , adolescent , child infant volunteer , age 6 month 65 year live Baney district Malabo city Bioko Island enrol base pre-defined inclusion exclusion criterion implement accord international ethical standard . The trial consist seven group ( Group 1a : young adult , age 18-35 ; Group 2 : old adult , age 36-65 ; Group 3 : adolescent , age 11-17 ; Group 4 : old child , age 6-10 ; Group 5 : young child , age 1-5 ; Groups 6a/b : infant , age 6 month - 11 month ) volunteer . Vaccination begin Group 1a ( young adult ) , three dos 2.7x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine give eight week apart DVI . An eighth group ( Group 1b : young adult , age 18- 35 ) , uniquely immunized comparator vaccine PfSPZ Challenge give chloroquine prophylaxis ( PfSPZ-CVac approach ) , rather PfSPZ Vaccine . A single PfSPZ-CVac younger adult group ( group 1b ) include provide direct comparison PfSPZ Vaccine ( group 1a ) ability protect CHMI . Each first two group ( 1a 1b ) 20 participant receive either PfSPZ Vaccine PfSPZ Challenge 6 participant receive NS placebo DVI , treatment allocation randomize double-blind . Volunteers Group 1b receive vaccination 8 week initial vaccination Group 1a . Volunteers Group 1 ( young adult ) receive CHMI 10 14 week post last vaccination ( window +/- 7 day side ) follow 8 week follow CHMI . Group 2 ( old adult ) receive three dos 2.7x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine . Group 2 consist 12 participant receive PfSPZ Vaccine 4 participant receive NS placebo DVI , give eight week apart . Group 3 , 4 , 5 6b 12 participant receive three dos 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine 4 participant receive NS , also give eight week apart . Group 6a consist 3 volunteer receive single dose 9.0 x10^5 PfSPZ Vaccine . Sequential age group stagger allow assessment safety tolerability age de-escalation . To assure safety , vaccination start young adult progress young old age group use staggered start date approximately weekly interval . Age escalation initial age de-escalation take place time , hence Group 2 3 vaccinated time . Progressively young age group immunize . The decision proceed step make study team review safety data previously vaccinate group ( ) . Three Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) meeting schedule review data prior initiate young child infant group .</detailed_description>
