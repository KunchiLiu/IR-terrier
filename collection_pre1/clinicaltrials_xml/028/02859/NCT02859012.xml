	<brief_title>Study Axitinib Patients With Recurred Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) rare variant adenocarcinoma occur secretory gland salivary gland . Although ACC histologically low grade slow-growing , half patient eventually recurrent and/or metastatic disease . The natural course metastatic disease ACC relatively indolent ; however , patient metastatic disease ultimately die cancer . The management recur / metastatic ACC distinct therapeutic challenge insidious local growth pattern , propensity perineural involvement , tendency distant metastasis , pronounced ability recur prolonged period . 2 . Current treatment The role systemic chemotherapy ACC limit objective response cytotoxic molecular target agent infrequent , optimum regimen unclear . Because rarity ACC , clinical trial investigate efficacy systemic chemotherapy . Recurrent/metastatic ACC incurable disease standard treatment . VEGF highly express ACC expression correlate stage , tumor size , vascular invasion , recurrence metastasis . High expression VEGF Ki-67 independent poor prognostic factor ACC . MYB/NFIB translocation recently identify ACC MYB protein expression find ACC . MYB over-expression ACC correlate increased expression gene involve vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , KIT . More 70 % ACCs highly express oncogenic transcription factor c-myb , drive expression gene activate VEGFR c-kit pathway . Several line evidence suggest function VEGF , PDGFR signal ACC progression . The expression NF-kappaB p65 , iNOS , VEGF relate microvessel density . In vitro , inhibition VEGF expression via iNOS gene induce apoptosis ACC cell line . Axitinib ( AG-013736 ; Pfizer ) multi-targeted small-molecule inhibitor receptor tyrosine kinases involve tumor proliferation angiogenesis , include VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 , c-kit , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -α PFGFR-β . Axitinib ( AG-013736 ) demonstrate partial response last 4 month one patient ACC phase I trial . In aspect , Ho et al . conduct phase II study axitinib ACC . Interestingly , response rate 9.1 % tumor shrinkage observe 66.7 % Besides axitinib , antiangiogenic agent sutene dovitinib show promising activity ACC . Dovitinib , pan FGFR , VEGF , PDGFR inhibitor show one confirm partial response PR ( 3.1 % ) three unconfirmed PR ( 9.3 % ) . Interestingly , hyperphosphatemia observe study , one PR patient show strong PDGFR beta positivity , suggest antiangiogenic pathway important FGFR pathway . 3 . Gap , issue problem need address Based evidence suggest function VGFR , PDGFR signal ACC tumorigenesis progression , use axitinib reasonable valuable . However , huge gap ACC trial lack randomization trial . Until , randomize trial ACC rarity . Hence confirmatory trial ACC . Without randomization trial , say real efficacy axitinib . So design multicenter randomize trial axtinib ACC confirm efficacy axitinib orphan disease .</detailed_description>
