	<brief_summary>Background : Hereditary spastic paraplegia ( HSP ) usually progress slowly . Researchers want learn symptom change time . They want look change blood cell people common form HSP might allow good understand disease . Objectives : To learn common form hereditary spastic paraplegia find progresses time . Eligibility : People age 7 old SPG3A , SPG4A , SPG31 Design : Participants 1 two-hour visit year 5 year . At 1 visit , adult participant may skin biopsy . An area skin numb tool remove small piece skin . At visit , participant physical exam blood drawn . At visit , participant task like walk quickly climb stair . Participants give permission skin cell , DNA sample , data use study . The sample data identify information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Neurogenetics Branch ( NGB ) within National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) conduct study evaluate patient hereditary spastic paraplegia type 3A , 4 31 . The objective study understand disease progression closely related form hereditary spastic paraplegia use validate rating scale . We also hope develop bio- marker could use future treatment trial . OBJECTIVES The primary objective protocol study natural history common form autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia . The information obtain allow development treatment trial . In case , blood biologic sample ( include skin biopsy ) obtain future laboratory study . STUDY POPULATION The number participant enrol set 300 . DESIGN This observational study autosomal dominant form hereditary spastic paraplegia progression , pathophysiology biomarkers . OUTCOME MEASURES In study track disease progression use Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale ( SPRS ) . Also , measure level plasma lipid , insulin , leptin , certain micro RNAs investigate utility biomarkers .</detailed_description>
