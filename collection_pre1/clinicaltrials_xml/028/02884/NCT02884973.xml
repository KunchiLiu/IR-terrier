	<brief_summary>It estimate incidence congenital heart disease vary 0.5 1 % live birth , 5,000 new case per year currently France These serious disease life-threatening less short term . The advance surgical technique recent year improve prognosis patient first month life . The success surgery , among thing , condition support per complex operation , involve multimodal intensive monitoring , respiratory hemodynamic support technique . These element surveillance , NIRS ( Near-infrared spectroscopy ) allow measurement non-invasive tissue saturation ( rSO2 ) cerebral renal oxygen . The fundamental principle NIRS base estimate percentage proportion cerebral oxy-hemoglobin . A light source emit NIRS body tissue brain light absorbed refract depend tissue composition oxy-hemoglobin . Refracted light analyze NIRS turn use software help determine percentage oxyhemoglobin . Normal value cerebral NIRS 50 80 % .NIRS use accord principle estimate cerebral tissue oxygenation also tissue kidney . More figure , change NIRS compare baseline alert u condition tissue oxygenation allow u identify hypoxia time . Changes value NIRS depend 3 criterion : tissue blood flow , percentage oxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin percentage .</brief_summary>
