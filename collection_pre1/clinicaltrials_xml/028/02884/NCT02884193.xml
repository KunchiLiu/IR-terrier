	<brief_title>Effectiveness Technique `` Quick Icing '' ( QI ) Handgrip Strength Compared With Use Prolonged Cold Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology 1 . Type study : Experimental study , type randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) . 2 . Conceptual framework : - Quick rapid cool Icing : brief application cold , period 30 second body surface seek promote activation nervous system produce increase excitability . - Prolonged Cold : prolonged application cold , least 5 minute , body surface aim reduce nervous system activation slow nerve conduction . 3 . Operational definition variable : - Grip strength : Strength kilogram evaluate manual dynamometry test time grip . Force value record Excel table display data kilogram evaluate . ( Manual hydraulic dynamometer brand JAMAR® use ) . - Quick Icing : apply glass ice ventral region dominant forearm experimental group . - Prolonged cold : It shall implement ice pack ( ice bag ) , place ventral side dominant forearm one comparison group . - Control : Group people subject intervention . 4 . Sample : Place research : The study conduct laboratory physiotherapy rehabilitation science faculty building C5 401 room floor room , campus Casona de la Universidad Andrés Bello , Av Fernández Concha 700 , Las Condes . 5 . Methodological Design This research characteristics random analytical experimental design ( ECA ) , study conduct laboratory Intervention Kinesics , room 401 , fourth floor C5 , Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences , Campus Casona Las Condes , Av . Fernández Concha 700 , Comuna Las Condes . The sample select university community make faculty Rehabilitation Sciences ( FCR ) . The research register network clinical trial registry ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) , obtain registration number . The study submit ethic committee East Metropolitan Health Service ( SSMO ) , ensure bioethical labor standard meet . It approve August 23 , 2016 . This allowed start investigation . Population take student study first fourth year race Kinesiology , Speech Therapy Occupational Therapy . The sample determine deliberate selection process survey close question . This survey allow participant choose selection criterion propose work . The number participant make sample take convenience researcher . As inclusion criterion establish follow : Students Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences UNAB , subject old 18 year submit musculoskeletal disorder dominant upper extremity last 6 month . Moreover , exclusion criterion consider : presence pain discomfort perform handgrip dominant limb , intolerance cold , diseases cryoglobulinemia , Raynaud 's disease paroxysmal hemoglobinuria cold , rheumatic disease lupus erythematosus systemic , multiple myeloma rheumatoid arthritis , positive test cube ice osteosynthesis material stent dominant upper extremity . The exclusion criterion assess sample process selection survey participant . They designate three stage conduct study . Stage 1 , call `` Stage sampling '' consist application survey student different level three race faculty . Then analyze information collect perform first filter select potential participant . This filter give survey question reflect inclusive exclusive criterion . Personal contact student meet characteristic participation invite join study conduct . A selectable interested participating explain purpose investigation ask consent participate writing . The document give consent previously approve bioethics committee East Metropolitan Health Service ( SSMO ) , base Salvador Hospital , Providence commune . Stage 1 lasting three week , follow plan proposal Gantt chart . The second stage design , call `` Evaluation '' last two week accord proposal Gantt chart establish . This step completion ice cube test follow establish protocol . This apply second filter selectable subject agree participate consentidamente , exclude survey team . Then assessment ability participant make perform painless handgrip stage environmental condition carry research ( laboratory Physiotherapy Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences , Room 307 , fourth floor building C5 ) . Thus stage 2 instance second filtering selection participant , people eventually make work group study . Stage 3 , call `` Experimental '' , run eight week . Participants distribute form three work group , group call `` Quick Icing '' ( QI ) , another group call `` Prolonged Cold '' ( PC ) third group call `` Control '' ( C ) . The designation group advance simple randomization process use table random number , charge study director . Thus participant label number include specific group . This randomization process seek minimize selection bias . The director one numbered list participant group . From process randomization work group establish , , `` Quick Icing '' , `` Prolonged cold '' `` Control '' . After form three group , evaluator 1 record demographic characteristic participant . This record include data ; age , body mass index ( BMI ) , gender body fat percentage . This information extract survey participant selection form group measure percentage body fat . In analysis data determine homogeneity group establish comparison end process result . An evaluator 2 , unknown belongs participant , record maximum handgrip strength dominant limb individual . The maximum handgrip strength evaluate follow propose design test protocol use manual dynamometry , register force subject measure kilogram ( kg ) . The evaluator 2 shall request three execution within period 15 second leave rest interval 60 second attempt , accord protocol propose researcher , base work Watanabe col . The evaluator 2 tabulate value three execution Excel spreadsheet mark mean handgrip strength valoe record `` pre '' maximum force . Followed assessment process handgrip strength , lead participant intervention group correspond , ie group `` Quick icing '' group `` Prolonged Cold '' `` Control '' . In laboratory establish three work box , one intervention procedure . People contact subject pertain workgroup , without know participant group , achieve double-blind establish avoid bias intervention . Each participant seven minute respective work box . The first minute time question use installation individual , leave remain 6 application procedure . The protocol consist installation position person seat , support dominant forearm table leave visible ventral side segment . The participant group `` Quick icing '' subject application cold ventral side dominant forearm 30 second , use technique ice beaker dynamically . Participants must wait box six minute therapeutic intervention . The quick icing process apply 6 minute time describe . The group `` prolong Cold '' receive intervention `` ice bag '' period 5 half minute 1 minute ventral side dominant forearm . The `` Ice Bag '' weight 700 gram . The `` Control '' group receive placebo application `` ice bag '' empty . The bag apply 1 minute 6 half minute , prolong cold group . After 7 minute individual group return station evaluator 2 dynamometry record handgrip strength dominant segment Excel spreadsheet tabulate best record three possible attempt . This get value maximum force `` post '' people group . He complete `` experimental stage '' proceed step 4 call `` Data Analysis '' last three week allow order data , development descriptive inferential statistic . This stage lead research director , responsible store organize data collect evaluator . Descriptive statistic variable maximum isometric muscle strength pre post , intragroup intergroup average . Secondary variable age body mass index describe term average standard deviation . The secondary endpoint genre describe term frequency percentage . To represent descriptive statistic variable maximum force , graphic box , show average use . For variable statistical Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis variance apply determine normal distribution data , thus ass whether significant difference parameter . To make analysis STATA ® program use . According normal abnormal distribution data obtain ANOVA statistical test SHARIPO-WILK use . The result statistical test allow preparation Table 1 ( demographic data ) , reflect initial data participant group . Following framework inferential statistic proceed compare difference mean maximal isometric force pre- post intragroup intergroup use ANOVA statistical test Kruskal-Wallis depend whether distribution variable normal abnormal . The analysis also consider difference mean value maximum force consider variable intra- inter-group genre . Once statistical analysis do , consider two week analyze result approach discussion around . After complete stage design , proceed spread work application national international scientific journal , draft accordance regulation require journal run . It see period three month dissemination research . Parallel stage design register clinicaltrials.gov mode page report status investigation . 7 . Procedures Ice Cube Test 1 . Subject seat . 2 . Shoulder adduct without rotation . 3 . Elbow flex 90 ° . This ensured splint . 4 . Forearm supination . 5 . Placing ice cube ventral side contralateral forearm time 5 minute . 6 .
