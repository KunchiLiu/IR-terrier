	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1 . Definition FMD group nonatherosclerotic , noninflammatory arterial disease commonly involve renal , cervical ( carotid , vertebral ) artery . Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes , intimal , medial perimedial , may associate single patient . Angiographic classification include multifocal type , multiple stenoses 'string-of-beads ' appearance relate medial FMD , tubular focal type , clearly relate specific histological lesion ( unclassified FMD ) . Aneurysms dissection consider complication FMD frequently arise individual FMD . Therefore , presence without direct evidence FMD suffice diagnose condition . 2 . Presentations The prevalence symptomatic renal artery FMD 4/1000 prevalence cervical FMD probably half . Renovascular hypertension common manifestation renal artery FMD . Multifocal stenoses 'string-of-beads ' appearance observe angiography 80 % case , mostly woman age 30 50 year ; generally involve middle distal two-thirds main renal artery case also renal artery branch . Spontaneous renal artery dissection rare frequently coexist FMD . Cervical FMD complicate dissection headache , Horner 's syndrome ischemic stroke , associate intracranial aneurysm . As intracranial aneurysm may rupture lead subarachnoid haemorrhage , American Heart Association recommend perform magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) intracranial artery patient cervical artery FMD . Mesenteric iliac artery examine renal artery angiography cervical artery systematically examine use ultrasonography . In European Georges-Pompidou Hospital ( HEGP ) cohort ( unpublished result ) , cervical artery systematically examine . The prevalence diagnose multi-site FMD 28.0 % Zurich University Hospital study 16.4 % HEGP patient . This probably bottom estimate cervical artery FMD lesion affect C1-C2 segment carotid artery , segment difficult examine use ultrasonography . In order estimate study power number patient need , prevalence consider multi-site FMD 20-25 % . 3 . Diagnosis The presence renal artery FMD document follow non-invasive test , increase order accuracy : Doppler ultrasound , gadolinium-enhanced MRA , compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) . Vasbinder et al . ( 2004 ) prospective multicenter comparative study find CTA MRA reasonably good specificity detect renal artery stenosis due FMD ( 92 84 % , respectively ) . There publish comparative study non-invasive test detect cervical artery FMD , although Doppler ultrasound may disclose irregular pattern stenosis suggestive . CTA MRA probably effective ultrasonography detect lesion middle distal portion carotid vertebral artery may also document rule associate intracranial aneurysm . The commonly accept gold standard diagnose renal artery FMD intra-arterial angiogram digital subtraction . However , invasive test reserve patient clinically justify proceed revascularization procedure . Stenosis quantification , however , frequently difficult medial FMD `` string-of-beads '' appearance multiple web-like defect often present patient FMD , contribute clinically significant stenosis may apparent angiography . 4 . Management The value treatment establish renal artery FMD without hypertension . The management hypertension associate renal artery FMD involve revascularization and/or antihypertensive medication . Current recommendation reflect knowledge acquire concern atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension , although indication balloon angioplasty wider FMD atherosclerotic renovascular disease BP outcome angioplasty favourable FMD atherosclerosis . Revascularization recommend patient hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis - i.e . bilateral stenoses unilateral stenosis cause 60 % reduction luminal diameter - accelerated hypertension , resistant hypertension , malignant hypertension , hypertension unexplained unilateral small kidney , hypertension intolerance medication . It also useful young patient recent-onset hypertension hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis due FMD : case goal cure hypertension . The standard revascularization procedure balloon angioplasty bailout stent placement necessary . Surgical reconstruction indicate patient complex FMD extend segmental artery macroaneurysms . Antihypertensive drug treatment indicate patient long-standing hypertension persistent hypertension follow revascularization . Data management patient symptomatic carotid vertebral artery FMD scarce . Carotid vertebral artery dissection usually treat anticoagulation . In rare patient expand symptomatic pseudo-aneurysm , percutaneous angioplasty surgical repair consider . 5 . Progression FMD Renal artery FMD may progress severe stenosis renal atrophy , and/or stenosis affect artery within outside renal vasculature . The risk progression assess available study probably overestimate documentation progression obtain angiography , procedure routinely undertaken patient favourable clinical biological outcome . The disease progressive , however , Slovut Olin overview ( 2004 ) state patient FMD undergo yearly duplex ultrasonography detect progression disease , restenosis , loss kidney volume . There data prognosis patient symptomatic carotid vertebral artery FMD . The risk arterial disease progression time unknown . The risk ischemic stroke range 0 3 % per year study assess issue . 6 . Best Clinical Practice Published recommendation include : - Screening cause secondary hypertension - include renal artery FMD - case juvenile , grade 3 , malignant resistant hypertension - Irrespective severity hypertension , screen renal artery stenosis case clinical clue condition , presence paraombilical bruit asymmetrical kidney - Screening cervical intracranial FMD case renal artery FMD - Renal revascularization case hemodynamic stenosis associate hypertension patient age 30 less , associate accelerate , malignant resistant hypertension , associate small kidney treatment intolerance - In case document renal artery FMD , provide follow-up blood pressure ( BP ) , renal function kidney height use ultrasonography yearly basis case hypertension persistence recurrence follow revascularization , case poor control BP . In case renal artery FMD progression , renal imaging test renal revascularization may consider accordance indication revascularization . The investigator also consider document progression renal artery FMD indication screen new lesion progression pre-existing lesion cervical artery . 7 . Genetic factor FMD appear familial disease 10 % case ( OMIM # 135580 ) . The occurrence renal FMD sib pair identical twin first suggest possible inheritability . Our retrospective analysis 104 patient renal FMD show prevalence 11 % familial case , i.e . 11 % case least one sibling angiographic evidence renal artery FMD . Using high-resolution echo-tracking , elevate echo-tracking score carotid artery first-degree relative index case also find . FMD diagnose earlier , renal artery lesion frequently bilateral , FMD lesion frequently find extra-renal artery familial apparently sporadic case . The presence underlying genetic disease could therefore associated disease progression FMD . The investigator already collect lymphocyte DNA assess baseline characteristic , include renal artery morphology , 400 patient renal artery FMD give inform write consent familial study renal artery FMD ( Sponsor INSERM , RBM # 00-028 , CPP Paris-Cochin ) . Data patient include previous study use extend case-control study . 8 . Justification extend genome-wide study As indicate , several argument exist presence susceptibility gene FMD . Despite evidence , limited negative candidate gene study conduct , probably low frequency disease , phenotypic heterogeneity absence large national international collection affect subject . In meantime , knowledge acquire structure variation human gene Human Genome Project possibility rapidly genotyping hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) high-throughput technology facilitate large case-control study . Case control study indeed powerful method investigate implication genetic SNPs complex trait . It apply either candidate gene microarray technology . With technique , test three five hundred thousand SNPs ( 300 500K ) along human genome ( genome-wide association ( GWA ) study ) . Compared candidate gene , GW-SNPs type offer advantage new pathway uncover . Whereas strategy usually require large number case control complex trait , also use success categorical trait experimental setting investigate small number well characterized subject . To knowledge , GWA study never perform FMD . The collection 400 FMD HEGP together national prospective study make objective realistic . 2 . Objectives ARCADIA registry 1 . To collect standardized clinical , radiological , biological data patient FMD national registry . The prospective collection clinical , radiological biological standardize record lead short period time unique source well-phenotyped FMD case could help standardize diagnostic therapeutic procedure national level . This unique database collaboration centre greatly stimulate basic , clinical therapeutic research help identification new pathophysiological mechanism . This collection symptomatic patient establish centre dedicate hypertension care ( renovascular lesion ) cerebrovascular disease care ( cervical lesion ) . It expect recruit 400 patient present renovascular lesion 100 patient present cervical FMD three year . 2 . To estimate prevalence multiple sit disease , i.e . prevalence cervical artery FMD patient renal artery FMD vice versa . As indicated , screen cervicocranial FMD currently recommend patient renal FMD . Although similar recommendation screen renal artery FMD patient cervical FMD , screen require least patient high blood pressure , i.e . clue renovascular disease . It also useful case without definite hypertension presence renal artery FMD lesion would also help confirm FMD nature cervical lesion . The investigator therefore consider non-invasive investigation renal artery patient probable suspected cervical FMD reasonably fall within best clinical practice . 3 . To identify susceptibility gene renal artery FMD polymorphism could play role disease progression ass potential phenotype-genotype correlation . 4 . To organize clinical , radiological biological database biobank constitute unique resource initiate clinical research . Our goal share common anonymous standardized database , item accept participate centre , serve unique national FMD database available Hypertension Reference Centres ( ESH Hypertension Reference Centres ) vascular neurologist involve study . The creation development database unique tool future national study stimulate similar initiative European level .</detailed_description>
