	<brief_summary>Prospective data collect approximately 250 patient sustain BCFx without additional fracture ( ) symphysis . Patients follow accord standard ( routine ) approximately 6 week 3 month treatment . Data collection include fracture detail ( i.e . classification , mechanism injury ) , treatment detail , functional patient-reported outcome , anticipate procedure-related adverse event ( i.e . complication ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fractures condyle occur around one third patient sustain mandibular fracture . Bilateral fracture report around one fifth one third fracture mandibular condyle often combine fracture mandible facial skeleton . The treatment condylar fracture , particular bilateral condylar fracture ( BCFx ) , complex due many different fracture pattern , surgeon 's preference , local constraint health care system patient characteristic . Briefly , BCFx treat use either closed treatment ( CTx ) ( e.g . intermaxillary fixation [ IMF ] and/or functional therapy ) surgical treatment ( i.e . open reduction internal fixation [ ORIF ] ) fracture , combination close treatment ORIF . The relationship treatments final outcome remain elusive , since available literature report specific data patient sustain BCFx ignore inadequately report patient-reported outcome . Consequently lack clinical evidence assist decision-making process . Therefore , purpose registry collect data standardize manner regard treatment , clinical patient-oriented outcome , complication BCFx .</detailed_description>
