	<detailed_description>Beyond first 6 month anticoagulation , patient first episode unprovoked venous thromboembolism high risk recurrence stop anticoagulation ( 10 % one year 30 % 5 year ) . Extending anticoagulant therapy additional 18 month associate major reduction recurrent VTE ; however benefit tend lose stop anticoagulation follow-up period two year . This well demonstrated double-blind randomize PADIS PE trial compare 2 year 6 month anticoagulation follow-up two year study treatment discontinuation . This risk recurrence likely continuously increase year well risk chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( pulmonary embolism ) risk post-thrombotic syndrome ( deep vein thrombosis ) . In addition , risk factor complication remain uncertain . The first aim PADIS-EXTENSION trial estimate risk 6 year follow-up patient initially treat 6 month 24 month ( patient include PADIS PE PADIS DVT trial ) . Secondary aim identify risk factor complication long-term follow-up .</detailed_description>
