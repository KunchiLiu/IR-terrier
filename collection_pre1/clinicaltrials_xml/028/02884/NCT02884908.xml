	<brief_summary>The primary study objective determine efficacy pregabalin administer orally period 12 week reduce risky drinking symptom posttraumatic stress disorder select genotype gamma-amino butyric acid transporter receptor gene . The secondary objective ass safety tolerability pregabalin participant alcohol use disorder co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder select genotype gamma-amino butyric acid transporter receptor gene . The investigator utilize large diverse sample African-Americans include gender individual different type trauma . All participant receive standardize bi-weekly Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment ( BBCET ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nearly 60 % individual posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) comorbid alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . This comorbidity associate severe PTSD symptom , high rate psychosocial medical problem , high relapse rate , poorer treatment outcome . Pre-clinical study indicate PTSD AUD share common molecular underpinnings . Particularly , adaptation brain neuro- transmitter system chronic excessive drinking evident alcohol withdrawal share similarities PTSD cluster B E symptom ( characterize symptom re-experiencing hyper-arousal ) , initiate cycle relapse excessive drinking worsen PTSD symptom . Excessive glutamate reduce gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) neurotransmitter concentration find various brain region individual co-morbid PTSD/AUD . The anticonvulsant pregabalin ( high affinity alpha-2-delta auxiliary site voltage gate calcium channel ) modulate effect GABA transporter ( GAT-1 ) increase density GABA , show preliminary efficacy reduce drink AUD comorbid generalize anxiety disorder , improve outcomes PTSD . Large scale study ample statistical power VA setting community population , diverse combat non-combat related trauma , warrant evaluate promising preliminary evidence pregabalin improve outcome AUD PTSD . An important personalized medicine approach optimize pregabalin efficacy would select individual AUD PTSD genetic variation GAT-1 transporter match potential therapeutic effect specific type individual . In African-Americans , variant SLC6A1 gene promoter region insertion ( i.e. , non-insertion/insertion insertion/insertion ( NI/I I/I ) compare Non-insertion/Non-insertion ( NI/NI ) type significantly high level GAT-1promoter activity . The investigator , therefore , segregate target sample genetic variation GAT-1 transporter . Because low allelic frequency individual double copy insertion , investigator combine one group single copy ( i.e. , NI/I/II ) . This study test pregabalin efficacy reduce AUD PTSD Clusters B E 2 treatment group medication ( pregabalin , placebo ) x 2 genetic variant ( NI/I/II vs. NI/NI ) double- blind , placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial set target quit-date ( TQD ) drinking . The investigator utilize large diverse sample African-Americans include gender individual different type trauma . Pregabalin dose placebo titrate maximum dose baseline week 6 use double-dummy procedure ensure equivalence capsule receive . The TQD set week 6 . The split design ( post-TQD vs. pre-TQD ) allow study separately examine whether pregabalin 's therapeutic effect reduce drink prevent relapse post cessation whether cessation drinking result improve PTSD cluster B E symptom carrier specific GAT-1 transporter genotype . All participant receive standardize bi-weekly Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment ( BBCET ) follow-up post treatment 3 month assessment . The specific aim follow : Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis AUD patient treat pregabalin non-insertion/insertion insertion/insertion ( NI/I I/I ) variant SLC6A1 gene GABA transporter ( GAT-1 ) predictive ability drink heavily pregabalin-treated patient NI/NI genetic variant placebo-treated patient . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis AUD patient treat pregabalin non-insertion/insertion insertion/insertion ( NI/I I/I ) variant SLC6A1 gene GABA transporter ( GAT-1 ) efficacious reduce PTSD cluster B E symptom ( ) pregabalin-treated patient NI/NI genetic variant placebo-treated patient .</detailed_description>
