	<brief_title>Comparison Two Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Interventions Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) highly prevalent health condition , leading cause year live disability globally Denmark . In majority patient CLBP , underlie pathology cause identify CLBP acknowledge multifactorial . CLBP define symptom last period longer three month . The high prevalence CLBP cause substantial impact patient family , community health-care system , well financial burden . Besides pain disability people CLBP often experience psychosocial consequence sign anxiety depression effect social , leisure , work life . Recognition physical , psychological social consequence CLBP lead development widely accept biopsychosocial model understand manage CLBP . The World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) provide framework apply biopsychosocial model clinical practice , especially rehabilitation . By emphasize , disability dynamic interaction dimension body function , activity , participation , environmental personal factor , ICF help treat patient rather low back pain address biopsychosocial dimension disability . Disability arise complex multi-factorial mechanism therefore , rehabilitation process define complex health intervention undertake complex environment . Rehabilitation rather process treatment specific action , multidisciplinary team effectively manage complex problem see rehabilitation . Rehabilitation many potential active ingredient , combine different component whole sum part . There continue challenge offer evidence-based rehabilitation patient CLBP . A systematic review Kamper identify assess risk bias 12 randomize control trial ( RCT 's ) compare two multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention . In March 2016 perform updated literature search PubMed identical review identify one additional RCT compare two multidisciplinary intervention . Risk bias additional study assess use Cochrane risk bias tool ( The Cochrane Collaboration ) identical review . Nine 13 study disability pain primary secondary outcome . The multidisciplinary intervention compare varied across nine study content and/or time frame . As study heterogenic , pool comparison description possible . Overall nine study show multidisciplinary rehabilitation positive effect disability pain short medium term , discrepancy study whether effect maintain long term . A literature search identify two study follow-up care . One study test effect multidisciplinary rehabilitation subsequent booster session conduct telephone within 12 month discharge , find slight advantage , statistical significance booster session . The study compare 3-month exercise follow-up program routine follow-up patient CLBP complete 3-week outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program . Favourable outcome one year observe group , patient attend exercise follow-up program improve disability . There lack study adequate follow-up approach maintain successful treatment . No early study assess positive treatment effect multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention maintain intervention alternate inpatient intervention home-based activity . Aim To assess novel multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention effective maintain successful treatment 6 month , usual multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention patient chronic low back pain . The novel intervention 14-week program alternating total three week inpatient intervention home-based activity . This alternation allow participant time opportunity adapt transfer inpatient learn activity participation environment interaction everyday life situation surroundings . Furthermore , novel intervention consist high degree patient involvement usual intervention . Usual care four-week inpatient intervention . Objectives ( ) To compare change two multidisciplinary rehabilitation group disability , pain , pain self-efficacy , quality life , anxiety/depression exercise capacity . ( ii ) To examine association change disability versus change pain , pain self-efficacy , quality life , anxiety/depression exercise capacity . Hypotheses ( ) The intervention group experience five point large improvement Oswestry Disability Index compare usual care . Furthermore , intervention group experience large improvement pain , pain self-efficacy , quality life , anxiety/depression exercise capacity compare usual care . ( ii ) There negative association change disability quality life , pain self-efficacy exercise capacity , respectively . There positive association disability pain anxiety/depression , respectively . The strong association disability pain self-efficacy . Materials method Study set All participant recruit , treat tested Sano Aarhus , Denmark . A rheumatologist perform selection participant base clinical problem referral . Randomization An independent administrative assistant perform randomly allocate computer-generated randomization participant either intervention control group . Stratified randomization basis Oswestry Disability Index score 40 used order achieve approximate balance disability two group . 1:1 allocation block 6 use . Due wait time , randomization take place average 5-6 month study start . Blinding As intervention perform physical setting time , blind participant intervene clinician possible due knowledge content duration intervention participant allocate . Intervening clinician involve treatment group assess physical status participant . In order raise equal expectation , participant blind study hypothesis tell RCT intend compare two equal multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention meet current scientific standard appropriate improve health status . The researcher involve statistical analysis blind treatment group . Sample size Oswestry Disability Index use sample size calculation . Based data literature pilot study 25 patient CLBP Sano , mean change estimate 10 intervention group 5 control group , standard deviation change estimate 10 . Using 80 % power significance level 0.05 , 64 participant require group . A dropout rate 25 % estimate , reason plan recruit total 160 participant . Interventions The content intervention describe detail study protocol recommend complex intervention . Both group manage multidisciplinary staff physical setting time . Participants two group inevitably meet , thus multidisciplinary staff opportunity compare discuss different rehabilitation intervention . Despite possible overflow two rehabilitation intervention , present parallel design prefer rather staggered design wait time external circumstance would different two group . Data collection Demographics PROMs collect randomization ( visitation time point ) , due 5-6 month wait time begin inpatient rehabilitation intervention ( baseline time point ) . Exercise capacity test perform trained physiotherapist use standardize protocol , clinical neurological finding collect experienced rheumatologist use standardized examination protocol , collect first inpatient contact . Follow-up data collect end inpatient rehabilitation intervention , follow-up ( intervention group ) 6 month . Participants drop ask fill PROMs 6 month . Participants enter data directly database via link . In order minimize miss data reminder send via email one week . If participant unable fill electronic version , independent administrative assistant enter data paper copy questionnaire . Perspective The present study emerge field patient , clinician researcher intersect consequently highly clinically relevant . If positive treatment effect maintain even improve long term , result may serve inspiration design multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention clinical practice ; valuable future patient CLBP .</detailed_description>
