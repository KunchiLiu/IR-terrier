	<brief_title>Improving Surgical Outcomes Patients With Low Grade Gliomas Using Advanced Pre- Intra-operative MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low grade glioma often locate near infiltrate important part brain involve language motor function . During surgery remove tumour , fine balance try remove much tumour possible limiting damage functionally important part brain , particularly young patient , may result impairment rest life . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) use identify functionally important cortical area diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) use identify important subcortical deep white matter tract connect region . The use advance image technique perform pre-operatively plan surgery commonplace however role guide actual operation limit occurrence 'brain shift ' , deformation contour brain parenchyma occur tumour resect . This result inaccuracies pre-operative advanced MRI data use neuronavigational system guide surgery . The main aim study determine optimal method provide update , spatially accurate data location functionally important area brain neurosurgeon intra-operatively . In study , two different technique compare . The first acquisition real-time fMRI DTI acquire intra-operatively tumour resection . The second use intra-operatively acquire structural diffusion sequence perform non-rigid co-registration fMRI DTI data acquire surgery . The feasibility accuracy two technique evaluate . The second aim study well understand effect tumour surgery language function important implication plan surgical approach , counsel patient possible risk surgery help decide long term treatment . This achieve performing advanced MRI scan , particular extensive language fMRI paradigm pre-operatively post-operatively patient gliomas undergoing surgery . This combined clinical testing language function . Greater understand neural plasticity functionally important system could allow great , maximal resection .</detailed_description>
