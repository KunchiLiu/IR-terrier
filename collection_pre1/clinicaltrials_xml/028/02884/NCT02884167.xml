	<brief_summary>Constipation symptom base disorder prevalence 15 % adult population management remain challenge . Although life threatening , constipation associate impaired quality life , increase healthcare cost excess work absenteeism . Constipation represent heterogeneous disorder multifactorial pathogenesis . Several risk factor suggest lead condition divide 3 main category : ) physiological , b ) environmental c ) demographic . To date , lack large epidemiological study propose aetiological factor constipation , especially study assess propose risk factor constipation together . The overall aim study investigate multidimensional ( physiological , environmental demographic ) predictor constipation use multivariate analysis statistical model . This large single centre case control study compare constipate adult healthy individual match age , gender ethnicity . The duration study 2 week total include screen visit , 2 week run-in period baseline visit end run-in period . Transit time constipate healthy individual assess baseline visit . Differences gastrointestinal symptom , dietary intake well difference stool output ( e.g . stool frequency consistency ) constipate healthy individual assess baseline period ( week baseline visit ) . Differences female sex hormone level well stool marker marker fermentation ( e.g . fecal water , stool pH , short chain fatty acid ) constipate healthy individual assess baseline visit . Furthermore , difference environmental measure ( physical activity , anxiety , smoke ) difference demographic measure ( age , gender , body mass index ) patient suffer constipation healthy individual also assess baseline visit .</brief_summary>
