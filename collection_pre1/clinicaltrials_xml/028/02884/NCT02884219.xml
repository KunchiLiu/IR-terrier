	<brief_summary>Much controversy exist optimal management patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) preterm infant , especially born gestational age &lt; 28 week and/or birth weight ≦1000 gram due lack evidence different approach . A PDA associate serious complication . However , common find medical and/or surgical treatment PDA seem reduce risk mortality major morbidity . This might relate fact substantial portion preterm infant treat unnecessarily , ductus arteriosus ( DA ) might close spontaneously without specific intervention . An expectative approach gain interest , although convince evidence still miss . The objective study investigate whether preterm infant &lt; 28 week ' gestation PDA expectative management inferior early treatment regard composite mortality and/or necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) postmenstrual age 36 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Treatment Versus Expectative Management PDA Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtainment inform consent first echocardiographic evaluation perform postnatal age 24-72 hour . In absence exclusion criterion patient randomize PDA present , transductal diameter measure &gt; 1.5 mm blood flow pattern predominantly left-to-right shunt observe . Randomization assign neonate either medical treatment ( COXi ) arm expectative PDA management arm . It essential neonatal management similar arm exception prescription COX-inhibition routine echocardiographic examination course COXi medical treatment arm . Medical treatment arm When patient allocate medical treatment arm COX-inhibition prescribed start soon possible , later 3 hour echocardiogram . The investigator prefer use Ibuprofen ( IBU ) COX-inhibition study . Aside mention reason investigator confront actual lack availability indomethacin center Netherlands Belgium . However , Indomethacin ( INDO ) prescribe medical ductal closure prefer participate center . The dose scheme IBU INDO accord local guideline . For first week life birth weight use calculation COXi dosage . After postnatal age 7 day actual weight use dose calculation , except actual weight still less birthweight . The treatment describe consider standard care many NICU 's worldwide . It note modification commonly advise usage IBU study . There report suggest high dose IBU might effective ductal closure preterm infant , especially less 27 week ' gestation . However , systematic review one refrain recommendation regard high dose IBU limit number patient enrolled study . The preferred route administration IBU intravenously . However , disposal attend physician , since enteral administration appear least effective . Echocardiographic reevaluation perform least 12 hour last ( 3rd ) dose first COXi course . If ductus arteriosus find close , analysis treatment need regard ductus arteriosus . A ductus arteriosus consider close ca n't visualize use color Doppler imaging transductal diameter measure less 0.5 mm . When ductus arteriosus n't close , second course COX-inhibition start least 24 hour third dose first course . COXi dosages similar first course . Twelve 24 hour last dose second course ( 6th gift ) echocardiography perform . If ductus arteriosus find close , analysis treatment need regard ductus arteriosus . When duct fail close two course COXi ( 6 dos total ) PDA judge still hemodynamically significant , ductal ligation consider , so-called 'ligation criterion ' met . Expectative PDA management arm Patients randomize expectative management arm receive COXi PDA management group characterize `` watchful waiting '' . This unique approach , since restrictive approach towards PDA increasingly use many center worldwide without observation increase risk neonatal mortality morbidity , severe chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) , NEC retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) . It essential neonatal management similar study arm exception prescription COXi echocardiography end drug course medical treatment arm . It upmost importance NO extra intervention undertaken intention conservatively prevent treat ( suspect ) PDA expectative arm , fluid restriction diuretic reason . Moreover , note insufficient evidence fluid restriction and/or diuretic benefit patient ( suspect ) PDA . When first week attend physician opinion patient danger , 's deprive treatment COXi , open label treatment consider 'open label criterion ' met .</detailed_description>
