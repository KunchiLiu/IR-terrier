	<brief_title>A Combined Nerve Block Elderly Patients Subjected Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The elderly patient poor tolerance anesthesia total hip replacement severe surgical trauma much blood loss . General anesthesia primary anesthesia method use previously total hip replacement elderly many limitation , example , interfere physiological function elderly patient . The organic function compensative ability elderly often weaken vary degree cardiovascular disease , pulmonary disease diabetes mellitus , thus nociceptive stimulus anesthesia surgery greatly influence stress . Stress refers organism 's non-specific reaction various nociceptive stimulus , i.e. , stressor , many factor involve . It stimulate sympathetic nerve , strengthen function hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , cause change various metabolism , thereby play important role maintain intraoperative vital sign recover postoperative immune function . Different anesthesia method produce different effect organism 's immune function . Effects anesthesia immune function closely related complication , postoperative infection . In addition , immunity elderly relatively poor normal healthy population . Therefore , rational anesthesia method important clinical significance safe surgery postoperative recovery elderly . A combined nerve block reportedly suitable total hip replacement elderly safety reliability . Previous related study focus primarily onset time anesthesia postoperative complication . To best knowledge , study report effect combine nerve block intraoperative stress postoperative immune function elderly patient subject total hip replacement . Therefore , study innovative mind . Adverse event If severe adverse event include expect unexpected symptom occur , information include data occurrence , type adverse event , measure take related treatment adverse event report project manager institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access Data collection : accord trial design type requirement , table develop record trial data . The recorded data input electronic database use double-data entry strategy train professional staff . Data management : information accuracy check recruited patient follow . The database lock researcher charge alter . All information relate trial preserve Qinghai University Affiliated Hospital , China . Data analysis : The electronic database make available professional statistician statistical analysis . An outcome analysis report make statistician submit lead researcher . An independent data monitoring committee supervise manage trial data goal ensure scientific stringent trial process , result accurate complete data . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish http : //www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician use SPSS 19.0 software follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , standard deviation , min , max . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median , upper quartile ( q3 ) . The Mann-Whitney U test use compare fast blood glucose level , serum cortisol concentration , hemorrheological index immune function-related index experimental control group . The Mcnemar χ2 test use compare incidence adverse event experimental control group , accept significance level α = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
