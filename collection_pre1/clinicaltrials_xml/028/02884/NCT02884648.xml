	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Ovarian Cancer Patients With Disease Second-look Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , participant receive bevacizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 every 21-day study cycle . Study Visits : Their first study visit 5-7 week second-look surgery time recover . The study doctor tell start study visit . During cycle : - They physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine testing . If become pregnant doctor think need , part routine blood sample may use pregnancy test . During Cycle 3 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 6 , 9 , 12 , ) , MRI CT scan . Length Treatment : They may continue receive bevacizumab long study doctor think best interest . They longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Their participation study end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 7 day last dose bevacizumab : - They physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine testing . If become pregnant , part sample use pregnancy test . This investigational study . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer , include ovarian cancer . However , consider investigational use bevacizumab treatment cancer find second-look surgery . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 35 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
