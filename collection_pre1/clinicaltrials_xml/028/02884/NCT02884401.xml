	<detailed_description>This prospective case series study aim radiographically assess change alveolar bone width height placement SLActive implant ( implant modify surface stimulate bone formation ) 12 month load post-menopausal osteoporotic woman . The null hypothesis : post-menopausal osteoporotic woman significant change peri-implant alveolar bone placement SLActive implant 12 month load term width height assess use CBCT image . The aim include 20 post-menopausal osteoporotic woman requirement tooth replace . However , consider potential drop-out rate 10 % , investigator plan increase recruitment trial 22 postmenopausal woman . They recruit Rheumatology Department Radiology Department Barts Health NHS Trust , amongst patient attend consultation osteoporosis specialist take Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . Before start visit , post-menopausal woman meet inclusion criterion ask study examiner agree quickly screen presence intercalate edentulous area ( edentulous area teeth ) may interested take part study . If agree , quick dental examination perform study examiner ( qualified dentist ) visit . The patient would qualify enrolment receive information study , patient information sheet consent form , together letter give General Dental Practitioner ( GDP ) order refer Centre Oral Clinical Research . The patient qualify enrolment receive report oral screen case require dental treatment . Once referral letter arrive Centre Oral Clinical Research , Barts Health , patient contact answer question book appointment attend enrolment visit , wish . The study consist 8 visit perform minimum period 15 month Centre Oral Clinical Research School Dentistry Queen Mary University London ( QMUL ) : 1 . Enrollment visit : - Signing informed consent ; - Recording concomitant medication ; - Confirmation participant eligibility pertain presence intercalate single edentulous area fulfil inclusion criterion ( wisdom teeth second molar exclude ) - Basic Periodontal Examination ( BPE ) recording ; - Clinical measurement periodontal parameter teeth adjacent area implant place ( Probing pocket Depth , PPD ; Recession , REC ; Plaque Index , PI ; Bleeding Probing , BOP ) - Exit participant eligible , arrangement full-mouth debridement treatment outside study protocol ( need ) refer GDP dental problem ( caries endodontic infection ) . If patient agrees , letter send General Practitioner ( GP ) inform participation study . 2 . Full-mouth debridement ( within 90 day enrolment ) : - Recording Adverse Event ( AE ) concomitant medication ; - Oral hygiene instruction supra sub gingival debridement teeth ( necessary ) use ultrasonic hand instrument indicate . Local anaesthesia may use required ensure pain control participant . In case participant require periodontal treatment , arrange outside study protocol . No implant place condition periodontal health ( pocket ≥5 mm ) reach . • In order plan implant placement accord clinician 's judgment complexity case , either Cone Bean Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scan peri-apical intra-oral x-ray , limited area implant placement , take . 3 . Implant placement ( within 120 day visit 2 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Implant placement . If require , simultaneous horizontal guide regeneration ( GBR ) alveolar bone collagen membrane ( Collprotect® , Botiss® , Zossen , Germany ) bovine osteoconductive graft ( Cerabone , Botiss® , Zossen , Germany ) perform ; - Recording maximum torque placement ; - Healing cap screw semi-submerged healing ; - Resonance frequency analysis ; - Standardized CBCT scan limit implant area No sinus lift case take consideration . 4 . Suture removal ( 7 day + 3 day Visit 3 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Clinical evaluation soft tissue healing ( visual inspection surgical site report complication ) ; - Suture removal ; - Resonance frequency analysis ; - Standardized CBCT scan limit implant area ( perform day implant placement ) . 5 . Implant impression ( 6 week ± 7 day Visit 3 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Implant impression ; - Resonance frequency analysis . In case horizontal GBR perform simultaneously implant placement , implant impression perform 11 week ( +7 day ) implant placement . 6 . Implant loading ( 8 week ± 7 day Visit 3 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Clinical measurement periodontal parameter teeth adjacent implant ( PPD , REC , PI , BOP ) ; - Implant load occlusion control ; - Resonance frequency analysis ; - Peri-apical X-ray In case GBR perform simultaneously implant placement , implant impression perform 12 week ( +7 day ) implant placement . 7 . 6-months follow-up ( 6 month ± 14 day Visit 6 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Clinical measurement periodontal parameter teeth adjacent implant ( PPD , REC , PI , BOP ) implant - Polish oral hygiene instruction ; - Resonance frequency analysis ; 8 . 12-months follow-up ( 12 month ± 14 day Visit 6 ) : - Recording AE concomitant medication ; - Clinical measurement periodontal parameter teeth adjacent implant ( PPD , REC , PI , BOP ) implant ; - Polish oral hygiene instruction ; - Resonance frequency analysis ; - CBCT scan evaluation implant survival success . Photos teeth/implant may take facilitate case documentation . The photo strictly limit implant/teeth area subject identifiable . At study completion , letter send patient 's GDP inform treatment provide highlight need treatment .</detailed_description>
