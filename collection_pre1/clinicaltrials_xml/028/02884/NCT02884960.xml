	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Embozene Microspheres compare Embosphere Microspheres treatment symptomatic uterine fibroid . A total 118 patent symptomatic uterine fibroid enrol 6 site . Symptom severity , health-related quality life , appearance fibroid assess prior treatment . Patients undergo uterine fibroid embolization procedure either Embosphere Microspheres Embozene Microspheres , randomly assign . Clinical outcome assess 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month procedure , image outcome obtain 3 month procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The uterine fibroid embolization ( UFE ) procedure accept , minimally invasive treatment option patient symptomatic uterine fibroid . Studies evaluate outcomes procedure establish use polyvinyl alcohol particle Embosphere Microspheres associate best clinical imaging outcome . Embozene Microspheres represent new embolic agent evaluate use treatment symptomatic fibroid . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness Embozene Microspheres compare Embosphere Microspheres treatment symptomatic uterine fibroid . A total 118 patent symptomatic uterine fibroid enrol 6 site . A questionnaire design assess symptom severity health-related quality life patient administer patient time enrollment . In addition , contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examination perform confirm diagnosis fibroid . Patients undergo uterine fibroid embolization procedure . The embolic agent use procedure ( Embosphere Microspheres Embozene Microspheres ) randomly assign . Patients see 1 month , 3 month , 6 month contact 12 month procedure questionnaire use assess clinical outcome . In addition , MRI perform 3 month procedure determine image response treatment .</detailed_description>
