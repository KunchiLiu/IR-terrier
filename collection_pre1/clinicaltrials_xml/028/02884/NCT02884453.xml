	<brief_summary>Some cancer oesophagus stomach express excessive copy either cMYC ( Myelocytomatosis oncogene ) gene , HER2 ( Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) gene . These gene may potentially contribute growth spread cancer.Ibrutinib drug already use treatment certain cancer immune system . There preclinical evidence show activity gastric stomach cancer cell over-expressing cMYC HER2 gene . The iMYC study ass activity ibrutinib cancer oesophagus stomach over-express gene previously treat standard chemotherapy . Any anti-cancer activity see measure correlate metabolic change FDG ( 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ) - PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan , change DNA circulate tumour cell blood , molecular change cancer use optional repeat tumour biopsy . If effect see could provide justification research group patient . Patients eligible advanced cancer oesophagus stomach treat least one line prior therapy . The study conduct Royal Marsden Hospital Sutton Chelsea sit . It involve initial group 17 patient . Screening , recruitment follow last 3 year total . Patients wish take part must consent cancer biopsied test cMYC HER2 amplification , well number image blood test . There optional tumour biopsy whilst study . Patients treat ibrutinib progression disease unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof-of-concept Study Ibrutinib c-MYC HER2 Amplified Oesophagogastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm phase II study . Patients receive standard dose single-agent ibrutinib deliver orally dose 560mg daily continuously 4 weekly cycle disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . Single arm , open label mean researcher participant know treatment administer , participant trial receive study drug ibrutinib . A Phase 2 study choose information efficacy toxicity drug specific group patient need prior consider large phase 3 study . Eligible patient advance unresectable metastatic oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma treat least 1 prior chemotherapy advance metastatic disease . In case HER2 positive tumour , previous treatment chemotherapy without HER2 target agent allow . There two step enrollment process : 1 . Enrollment prescreening establish cMYC HER2 status ( may occur 1st line treatment progression 1st line treatment ) 2 . Enrollment randomisation treatment The patient first give prescreening participant information sheet ( PIS ) inform consent form ( ICF ) approve Ethics Committee . They study explain give opportunity ask question . If agree take part , ask sign approve consent form , keep copy sign consent form . Prescreening If participant agrees take part prescreening study previously obtain sample cancer ( usually diagnostic biopsy ) take storage send trial laboratory tissue test cMYC HER2 amplification . If archival tumour sample available exist tumour sample insufficient quality , patient give option consent pre-screening biopsy obtain fresh sample . A blood test take plasma DNA analysis include circulate tumour cell number , c-MYC copy number variation ( digital droplet PCR ) blood-borne biomarkers . It take 4 week get result try pre-screen patient avoid delays treatment . When patient 's disease progress 1st line treatment suitable candidate second line treatment team confirm space available study accord patient cMYC HER2 status . If space available give main study PIS ICF approve Ethics Committee . They study explain give opportunity ask question . If agree take part , ask sign approve consent form , keep copy sign consent form Screening If participant agrees take part main study , assessment make make sure he/she eligible study . Some assessment may already do part participant 's standard care , case , result test may use . The assessment do describe : Disease status Tumour sample detail , c-MYC HER2 status re-tested Medical/surgical history Pregnancy test female patient World Health Organisation ( ECOG ) performance status Physical examination ass condition current ongoing . Vital sign : height , weight , pulse , systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure ECG Tumour biopsy* Tumour assessment ( RECIST v1.1 ) , consist either stag CT MRI image FDG-PET scan* Concomitant medication . Adverse event Blood test clinical biochemistry haematology Urinalysis Blood test DNA analysis include Circulating Tumor Cell ( CTC ) number , c-MYC copy number variation ( digital droplet PCR ) bloodborne biomarker analysis* *These procedure carry criteria trial entry meet . If result screen test confirm patient take part study ask return clinic see doctor assessment detail study treatment period . Study treatment period During treatment period patient see regularly clinic.The treatment oral capsule give per day every day cycle last 28 day . Patients see day 1 , 8 15 first cycle treatment day 1 every cycle ( every four week ) remainder study duration . When stop treat within study 30 day follow visit follow every 8 week , although contact telephone . Before treatment cycle , patient examine safety blood test make sure safe proceed treatment mention . Patients different procedure do different time study treatment period include : Measurement rest blood pressure pulse rate every treatment ( study visit ) . Physical examination begin cycle ( every four week ) . Documentation change medication take whether patient problem discomfort since last visit ( study visit ) . An ECG baseline completion study , timepoint clinically indicate Blood sample check haematology clinical chemistry result ( every 4 week clinically indicate ) Blood sample plasma DNA analysis include CTC number , c-MYC copy number variation ( ddPCR ) bloodborne biomarker analysis . These take cycle 1 day 15 , cycle 3 day 1 every 8 week ( alternate cycle ) . Blood sample assess pharmacokinetics ibrutinib cycle 1 day 8 ( predose , 2 hour , 6 hour post dose ) one sample cycle 1 day 15 . Assessment status disease use CT MRI image week 8 every 8 week . Assessment PET CT scan baseline , day 14 week 8 correlate tumour response genetic change see Health related quality life questionaires patient fill begin cycle ( every 4 week ) As mention , biopsy time screen mandatory entry trial . As part trial optional biopsy offer patient : day 14 ( patient ibrutinib ) week 8 ( patient respond ibrutinib ) discontinuation study treatment ( patient progress ibrutinib ) Treatment discontinuation visit : When patient withdraws study treatment permanently discontinue , need attend clinic visit follow assessment carry : Changes medication take problem discomfort since last visit document . If patient side effect final study visit withdrawal visit study doctor may wish contact ask , completely resolve . The study sponsor may also ask study doctor information . When patient complete study , doctor decide whether require treatment outside study . They continue follow within study every 8 week document cancer treatment may may take document overall survival . This contact may clinic attend hospital telephone . Timeline Final Report The study plan recruit 24 month 12 month follow final report plan within 12 month last patient 's last visit .</detailed_description>
