	<brief_summary>Title : Evaluation last version PMD200TM NoL index patient undergo laparotomy intraoperative epidural analgesia Objectives : Measure NoL Index variability nociceptive stimulus various intravenous remifentanil infusion rate . To compare result obtain PMD200TM gather previous study PMD100TM clinical condition . Study Design : Prospective observational study Subject Population : Adults schedule undergo elective abdominal surgery laparotomy general anesthesia epidural analgesia Sample Size : 30 patient Study Duration : Starts April 2016 - Ends September 2016 Study Center : Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital , Montreal , Quebec , Canada Adverse Events : None expect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Evaluation Last Version PMD200TM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The motivation behind actual observational propose study validate ability new PMD-200TM system accurately detect nociceptive stimulus might occur anesthesia surgery ( e.g . laryngoscopy tracheal intubation , incision , standardized electrical stimulation use previous study do HMR… ) . The NoL index also record period time without stimulation call baseline value NoL standard anesthesia . The PMD100TM early prototype pain monitor device develop Medasense Biometrics Ltd ( Ramat Yishai , Israel ) , use center Montreal recently complete clinical trial . This device base software integrate computer analyze different criterion multi-parametric index name NoL estimate nociception level general anesthesia incorporate heart rate , heart rate variability ( 0.15-0.4 Hz band power ) , plethysmograph wave amplitude , skin conductance level , number skin conductance fluctuation ( NSCF ) , time derivative , use non-linear regression technique . The rationale use skin conductance NSCF presence physical stressor lead sympathetic-mediated filling palmar sweat gland , thus change ion concentration skin conductance . It show correlate clinical stress score intubation less reactive tetanic stimulation remifentanil perfused1 . With Medasense device PMD100TM , five variable obtain single non-invasive finger probe connect finger patient computer . Only signal patient record . No signal sent patient PMD100TM . The NoL Index obtain display Medasense PMD100™ computer single number 0 100 , low score propose represent less painful stimulation . The PMD-200TM system advanced configuration product final stage development , introduction several enhancement relate Hardware ( HW ) Software ( SW ) platform : 1 . Enhanced finger probe - include 4 new sensor ( slightly different sensor use PMD-100 efficient term quality signal ) 2 . Improvement signal acquisition board - HW module convert analog signal sensor digital data 3 . All one system - enables integrate view record signal NoL index touch base user interface ( previous interface PMD100 computer screen ) 4 . A new Graphic user interface user The purpose new prospective observational study finalize PMD200TM device evaluate response multi-parameter index ( Nociception Level [ NoL ] Index ) patient combine general anesthesia/epidural anesthesia laparotomy subject standard painful stimulus ( laryngoscopy intubation classical dose remifentanil 1mcg/kg i.v . bolus 0.05 mcg/kg/min i.v . infusion intubation ; incision remifentanil bolus 0.3mcg/kg + remifentanil i.v . infusion 0.05mcg/kg/min ) . Also surgery , standardized electrical stimulation ulnar nerve ( 70 mA , 100 Hz 30 second ) different dos remifentanil steady state infusion ( 0.005 mcg/kg/min ; 0.05 mcg/kg/min ; 0.1 mcg/kg/min ) perform previous study HMR Scientific Ethic Committee approval 2015 . This study resemble observational study do 2015 team PMD100TM . The purpose study validate quality signal obtain new finalize PMD200TM device equivalent well signal receive PMD100TM equivalent clinical condition ( see previous study register CT.gov ) . Studying effect different dos infuse remifentanil new finalize version NoL Index PMD200TM device patient subject standardized painful stimulus general anaesthesia would help validate final version compare result prototype use center previous study . Primary Aim : Measure NoL Index variability value nociceptive stimulus various intravenous remifentanil infusion dos , NoL take final version device PMD200TM . Secondary Aims : Establish correlation NoL Index variability and/or value infuse dose remifentanil PMD100TM . Measure sensitivity specificity study index detect painful stimulus . Also , end surgery , still record NoL index PMD200TM device . And also record first pain score patient extubated PACU . This do observational manner . We evaluate whether last NoL index record general anesthesia end surgical procedure ( last stiches ) patient still control ventilation correlate first pain score PACU .</detailed_description>
