	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Musculoskeletal disorder report second large contributor year live disability worldwide , osteoarthritis ( OA ) hips knee among prevalent ( 1 ) . The diagnosis hip OA base radiographic finding symptomatic evidence ( 2 ) , prevalence 5.8 % report Norway ( 3 ) . OA increase age , every person 60 year show sign osteoarthritis least one joint ( 3 ) . The dominant factor OA pathogenesis loss articular cartilage accompany joint deformation , bone sclerosis , capsule shrinkage , muscle atrophy vary degree synovitis ( 4 ) . Physical activity restrict pain , patient tend become increasingly unfit diminished muscle strength . Intra-articular change accompany compensatory adjustment body posture muscular tension , include decrease lumbar lordosis thoracic kyphosis asymmetry pelvis trunk ( 5 ) . Symptoms compensational movement adjustment consequences patient ' daily movement functioning , social life self-confidence ( 6 ) . A substantial increase primary hip insertion last 20 year show Norway data Norwegian Arthroplasty Register ( 7 ) . The 2014 Annual Report show 8.099 primary hip prosthesis , 1284 revision , arthroplasty frequent woman men ( 8 ) . The risk revision decrease year due less aseptic loosening prosthetic component ( 9 ) , infection still challenge ( 10 ) . The impact overweight obese Being overweight obese increasingly recognize important risk factor OA weight bear joint ( 11,12 ) . The evidence association obesity development hip OA , however , conflict ( 3,13,14 ) . Reduction body fat overweight obese people still recommend order reduce mechanical biochemical stressor contribute joint degeneration ( 15-17 ) . Recommendations non-surgical management hip OA . There insufficient high-quality evidence regard non-pharmacological nonsurgical intervention hip OA ( 18-21 ) , clinical guideline rather similar recommendation ( 19,21,22 ) .The European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) recommend broad range topic like patient education , lifestyle change , exercise modality , weight loss , assistive technology adaptation , footwear work modification , along biopsychosocial approach assessment treatment individualize treatment plan ( 21 ) . Patient education ( PE ) Empowerment patient information counsel important element up-to-date conservative treatment plan . PE develop Sweden Klässbo et al . ( 23 ) aim empower patient , call Better Management Patients Osteoarthritis ( BOA www.boaregistret.se ) . In Sweden PE implement country , participation require total hip arthroplasty offer ( Socialstyrelsen 2012 ) . In Denmark , PE ( Good Life osteoarthritsis Denmark , GLA : D ( www.glaid.dk ) combine six week individualize supervise neuromuscular exercise . Even good result show program regard pain BOA ( 24 ) . A study examine supplementary effect supervise exercise vs. education alone presently carried patient severe hip OA ( 25 ) . A PE call ActiveA ( active living lower limb osteoarthritis ) also try patient hip knee OA Oslo ( 26 ) . PE base ActiveA principle establish `` Lærings- og mestringssenteret '' , Haukeland University Hospital ( HUS ) patient hip knee osteoarthritis Hordaland County . Exercise therapy hip OA Underlying mechanisms beneficial effect non-surgical treatment hip OA scarcely understand . Irrespective joint , evidence effect exercise pathogenesis OA ( 27 ) . It suggest exercise work stabilize surround musculature OA-affected joint . As muscle weakness dispose osteoarthritis , exercise may halt progression disease . Endurance train enable patient manage weight loss , improve general physical functioning . Beckwée et al . ( 28 ) propose neuromuscular , peri-articular , intra-articular , general fitness health , psychosocial component might explain exercise induced improvement pain function.The scientific evidence recommend therapeutic exercise hip OA examine several systematic review meta-analysis ( 18 , 29-35 ) . Strong evidence claim beneficial effect land- water base aerobic strengthen exercise program adults mild moderate OA ( 35 ) , apply mainly short-term effect . Some RCTs able show difference long-term change pain patient receive PE combine traditional exercise manual therapy , versus PE alone ( 36 , 37 ) sham therapy ( 38 ) . Svege et al . ( 39 ) demonstrate , however , PE exercise combine might postpone arthroplasty . Recommendations make therapeutic exercise program hip knee OA focus strengthen entire low limb use non-weight bearing exercise question ( 32 ) . Neuromuscular training recommend , aim restore neutral functional alignment low extremity , improve dynamic motor control functional stability ( 24 ) . Although physical exercise program primarily recommend patient early phase OA , presently moderate quality evidence preoperative exercise improve function prior THA ( 40 , 41 ) . How Basic Body Awareness Therapy ( BBAT ) beneficial effect patient hip OA ? Empowering patient movement awareness learning consider important transform dysfunctional movement functional movement habit ( 42-44 ) . Concrete strategy use BBAT improve quality movement daily life . Long-lasting condition , hip OA , affect multiple aspect person ' ability move function . Integrated BBAT program aspect four perspective human movement ; biomechanical , physiological , psych-socio-cultural existential , movement awareness consider prerequisite movement quality . Basic element human movement relate ground vertical axis , free breathe find appropriate amount energy require task , implement BBAT . Movements carry lying , sit , stand , walk also interplay another person ( 45,46 ) . Between Basic Body Awareness Therapy session , patient encourage practice movement ) implement train program home , b ) implementing quality movement daily life situation . BBAT organize group intervention ( 47 , 48 ) , focus participant ' search optimal balance , core stability , free breathing awareness , address movement coordination whole body . Evaluation therapy progress do continuously physiotherapist together patient . Pilot study A pilot study seven patient hip OA , take part Patient Education ( 2 hour ) Basic Body Awareness Therapy ( 12 time 1.5 hour weekly ) , undertaken 2014 . After four month , four seven patient demonstrated clinical significant less pain walking . At follow-up six month later , three five patient still report clinical significant less pain walking ( two drop-outs unrelated hip problem ) . One patient report unchanged one bad , minimum joint space = 0 . Only patient report worse motivate surgery 10 month . Aim RCT study : To examine supplementary effect BBAT patient hip OA , compare effect Patient Education alone Patient Education BBAT combine . METHOD Design The randomized control trial include patient primary hip OA randomize one two study arm ; 1 ) Patient Education Basic Body Awareness Therapy , 2 ) Patient Education . Participants Patients verify hip OA ( x-rays clinical symptom ) recruit among patient refer Primary Health Care Orthopedic department Haukeland University Hospital participate Patient Education `` Lærings- og mestringssenteret '' . Written inform consent prerequisite participation . Sample size Pain Numeric Rating Scale ( scale 0-100 ) : The expected difference change group 17 point 0-100 Numeric Rating Scale , consider minimum important difference improvement ( 53 ) . Based previous study ( 54 ) , investigator assume between-participant standard deviation change 30 point . The required sample size , 80 % power type I error 0.05 44 group . Allowing 15 % drop-out , total 100 patient require . Disability HOOS ADL subscale ( 0-100 ) : Seventy four patient need detect clinically significant change 10 point HOOS ADL subscale SD=30 , power=0.80 alpha= 0.05 ( 55 ) .100 patient accordingly sufficient sample size HOOS . Randomization blinding : A computer-generated block randomization schedule use allocate participant one two group 1 ) give write informed consent participate study , 2 ) fill questionnaire test blind assessor , 3 ) participate PE . A research coordinator involve randomization procedure , prepare opaque envelope allocation group . Interventions Patient Education : The overall focus Patient Education empowerment patient increase knowledge hip OA condition learn deal . The patient ' experience hip OA active share group forefront . Basic Body awareness Therapy ( BBAT ) : BBAT implement group therapy ( 48 ) . A group include 5-10 patient , lead specialist physiotherapist qualify BBAT , offer week . Each session last 90 minute , include movement practice ( 70 minute ) follow talk ( 20 minute ) let group member share movement experience . The participant consecutively admitted class , participate 12 session . In way experienced participant share experience motivate novice . BBAT offer group therapy Primary Health Care . Analysis RCT : Comparison change randomize group perform linear regression ( ANCOVA ) analysis , control baseline score . Per protocol intention-to-treat analysis perform . Ethical consideration : The project conduct conformity `` Declaration Helsinki '' . Approval Regional Ethical Committee recived September 2015 .</detailed_description>
