Inclusion criterion establish : participant age 18 year people discomfort pain handgrip . Moreover Exclusion criterion consider : muscle pathology skeletal hand , wrist elbow last 6 month , presence material osteosynthesis endoprosthesis area application , peripheral neurological disease neuropraxias nervous cut , skin disorder application area , burn , wound , scar , apprehension fear application electrotherapy , non-completion evaluation protocol / intervention design studio away , sign consent participation . 3 stage conduct study designate . Stage 1 call `` The Sample Phase '' , duration one week . This Phase consist implementation survey student , follow analysis collect information registration first filter potential participant . The survey apply course Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences . The first filter give survey question specifics question inclusion exclusion criterion . Participants meet characteristic participation invite join study . The student contact personally . Students interested explain detail study ask give write consent . Informed consent reflect 4 principle bioethics safeguard integrity person . The second stage design call `` Evaluation Phase '' last 5 day . In phase ability perform hand grip participant accord protocol establish investigation assess . The strength assessment probe condition work study . At level , people explain everything concern characteristic electrical stimulation use , applicable . This stage mark second filter instance dismiss student discomfort inability perform handgrip . After phase final number participant make final sample study , give way step 3 . The stage call `` Experimentation Phase '' duration 3 week . The sample randomly establish three work group , group call `` Cathode Stimulation '' , another group call `` Anode Stimulation '' third group call `` Control Group '' . The group `` Cathode stimulation '' include 48 participant , `` Anode Group '' 52 participant `` Group Control '' 50 participant . The designation group participant , conduct director study , simple randomization process , Microsoft Excel® program . This allowed decrease selection bias . After process director conduce student box force evaluate . A first evaluator ( Evaluator 1 ) analyze demographic characteristic group , include age , body mass index ( BMI ) , gender , allow determine characteristic per group . This would establish comparison end work , take result . This information obtain survey . The participant 3 group evaluate another evaluator ( Evaluator 2 ) , record average maximum handgrip force develop dominant limb participant . Grip strength evaluate accord evaluation protocol propose manual torque test , register kilogram ( kg ) force develop understand . The evaluation include 3 execution leave rest interval 15 second attempt ( measurement protocol ) . The evaluator 2 record Excel spreadsheet initial 3 attempt , leave best maximal force value definitive . This consider maximal handgrip Force value prior intervention . After director derive participant accord particulary group , Cathode , Anode Control . The design feature participation three therapist , one work group . Therapist know data obtain evaluation strength , student belong group . Physiotherapists executor familiar application electric current . Each therapist work use direct current 500 COMBI GYMNA® equipment company . In application work one channel team , apply electrode engine flexor muscle forearm dominant point electrode closing circuit side face opposite arm . It take described motor point SENIAM corporation , recommend specific motor point application surface electromyography . For Cathode group black electrode use forearm muscle flexor dominant side anode group red electrode use forearm muscle flexor dominant side , control group black electrode use musculature . The first two group give current intensity 2mA ( base safety recommendation apply direct current ) , control group apply current . With parameter current density 0,04mA /cm2 obtain . ( rubber electrode coal rectangular area 48cm2 ) . Each therapist mask output color channel electrode black tape , know black red electrode . The treatment time group 10 minute , accord protocol establish investigation . This generate dose current 5mA/min . Participants three group instal wooden stretcher sit Fowlers position maintain 45 ° angle . The electrode place side dominant limb device screen face towards foot participant , person could display current value set . After application current , participant leave room intervention lead director force assessment room . In room would register best post maximum grip strength . The evaluator record three attempt , leave time 15 second . The evaluator 1 record average 3 value Excel spreadsheet . This value designate post test ( maximal strength post intervention ) . After complete measurement two week available sort data analysis record information . This task drive research director responsible store sort data receive evaluator . The Microsoft Excel program use process register data . Descriptive statistic maximum strength represent form average , frequency standard deviation . This information also represent graphs box compare IMC , gender age per group . Inferential statistic development Shapiro Will test determinate normally distribute data , use ANOVA test T-test . For data normally distribute Kruskal-Wallis test apply . The statistic perform de STATA program . Once statistical analysis do within 3 week analysis result , approach discussion result consider . 2 . Measurement handgrip strength protocol pre post electrotherapy Measuring handgrip strength conduct laboratory physiotherapy , room 401 , 4th floor , build C5 University Andres Bello ( UNAB ) , Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences , Campus Casona , Las Condes , Street Fernández Concha Nº700 , Santiago , Chile . Initially , participant instruct sit straight chair dimension 42cm high , 46 cm wide 40 cm long , back tilt 10 ° dimension 43 cm high 46 cm wide , participant shall place foot flat floor , erect trunk contact back , head neck neutral position , shoulder adduct , neutral rotation , elbow bent 90 , forearm prone neutral supination , unsupported surface wrist position neutra.67 test , hydraulic hand dynamometer model Dynatron® weight 600g , dimension 26 cm long 13 cm wide , read use dual measurement scale 200lbs / 90kg , also five level manual adjustment , set second level . The estimated time measure participant 2 minute . The handgrip strength measure 3 occasion , break measurement 15 second , take estimate 54 second net force measurement participant time . Participants instructed position correctly workstation apply maximum force 3 second work maximum effort test return marker measure instrument 0 lbs / measurement kg . The evaluator register average maximal handgrip strength 3 attempt . For data registration use Microsoft Excel® program . The division consist 3 category participant , Cathode Group , Anode Group Control Group . The pre electrotherapy application data record immediately measurement palmar force dynamometry . 2 . Electrotherapy Protocol The intervention take place laboratory physiotherapy , room 401 , 4th floor , build C5 University Andres Bello ( UNAB ) , Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences , Campus Casona , Las Condes , Street Fernández Concha Nº700 , Santiago , Chile . After initial force measurement participant place particular station apply electrotherapy , participant instruct position sit position 45º stretcher fix two body , dimension 190cm long 70cm wide 80cm high , participant must support trunk top table , incline 45 degree , elbow , forearm arm bare skin , well support stretcher .
