	<detailed_description>Mouthrinses contain essential oil 21 % - 26 % alcohol claim potent inhibitor plaque formation , although recently publish study suggest otherwise . Recently , new product series mouthwash introduce additional antimicrobial agent , Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate , derive lauric acid arginine add standard essential oil alcohol . Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate act cationic surfactant wide spectrum activity Gram positive - negative bacteria , yeast fungi act modify permeability membrane . Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate use multi-functional component formulation cosmetic toiletry product , claim act anti-static agent surfactant antimicrobial property . The Scientific Committee Consumer Safety , evaluate safety use ingredient consider Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate safe product use maximum concentration 0,15 % oral dental product . The manufacturer Essential Oils Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate claim Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate prevents formation biofilms , represent totally new way combat biofilm-diseases like caries , gingivitis periodontitis . Moreover , manufacturer announces product reduce plaque colonization dental surface 42.6 % bleed 50.9 % 4 week . Few clinical study new mouthwash publish , although informational material cite marketing pamphlet . Thus , Aim present study test clinical plaque- gingivitis inhibit capacity Essential Oils Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate , without mechanical oral hygiene , use modify experimental gingivitis model , 21.6 % hydroalcoholic sterile water control . The HYPOTHESIS test solution equally effective prevent dental plaque placebo solution Experimental gingivitis model . The present study design parallel , split-mouth , double mask , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical study . The experimental gingivitis model , modification Preus et al . use induce gingival inflammation supervise condition throughout study . The study approve Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics , South East Norway , 2015 follow Consort 2010 guideline . The study population comprise seventy-four dental , medical , dental hygienist student , well clinical teacher , volunteer participate project . An information meeting arrange volunteer prior start study , participant receive information oral rinsing product general Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate/Essential Oils Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate product well information study ahead , particular . Fifteen subject withdraw personal reason time , mostly become aware could brush teeth 1st quadrant 21 day , result fifty-nine participant sign informed consent form . Mean age 25 +/- 3.2yr 78 % female . The study period 21days , comprise special academic , religious ethnic feast event could jeopardize collective behavior study population . All information , administration data collection perform Department Periodontology , Institute Clinical Odontology , Faculty Dentistry , University Oslo , Norway . Inclusion criteria &amp; Exclusion criterion list `` inclusion Exclusion criterion '' . The test solution commercially available mouthwash product Essential Oils Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate contain essential oil Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate 21.6 % alcohol . The first control true placebo solution ; hydro-alcohol solution make 96 % ethanol dilute sterilized water final concentration 21.6 % . The second control solution , plain sterilized water , use negative control use control study test effect Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate product . Both control solution enrich 0.2 % Fluorid order prevent development early carious lesion course study . The test solution fluoridate since could change activity active ingredient . The three solution fill identical , label ( 1,2 3 ) bottle . Randomization carry use computer generate random allocation table assign participant three study group 20 test subject group 2 3 . Group 1 contain 19 participant . They carefully instruct rinse 30 second twice day content designate mouthwash . 30 second recommended manufacturer test solution therefore recommend control well . The statistician perform randomization whereas project leader distribute rinse solution instruction list generate described . Setting baseline dental plaque score zero do give participant professional tooth clean rubber cup , pumice paste dental floss prior start study first day study period . Passing baseline , participant give test solution subsequently instruct rinse , supervise project leader ( ) , describe allocated test solution . This do since Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate claim inhibitor biofilm formation , therefore apply immediately follow removal biofilm . Individual plastic tooth guard produce fit teeth upper right quadrant participant prior baseline . Together individual tooth guard , participant give identical prophylaxis pack contain medium texture tooth brush , inter-dental floss dentifrice . They instruct substitute daily oral hygiene remedy one give , attach tooth guard toothbrush , provide rubber string , initially use tooth guard always remember use brush . The participant instruct insert tooth guard Quadrant 1 every time brush teeth perform mechanical oral hygiene routine twice day three quadrant . After brush properly , instruct rinse 30 second water remove tooth guard . And rinse 30 second water without mouth guard . Following procedure participant rinse , instruct , solution randomly assign . This oral hygiene routine repeat 21 day . The study design stringency logistics ensure study participant serve control , one quadrant expose chemical rinsing ( quadrant 1 ) upper leave quadrant ( Quadrant 2 ) receive traditional tooth brush inter-dental cleaning addition chemical rinsing . Following last scoring day 21 , participant receive professional tooth clean score end study . A team four people trained procedure inform participant , receive test person evaluation , questionnaire clinically monitor visit . The principal investigator project manager manage contact participant outside score room . In appointment project team keep touch test person text message e-mail . The success service evident zero no-shows clinic , case also previous study design . Preceding every examination , project manager interview participant compliance receive verbal complaint description subjective side-effects . Before enter score room order participant refrain conversation score scientist inside . The recorder instruct likewise . In score room , two researcher obtain clinical data . At day 7 14 clinical recording base clinical appearance adverse effect respective solution . Moreover , visit also think important follow protocol participant . At day 21 plaque index ( primary endpoint ) secondary endpoint gingival index ( secondary endpoint ) record mesial , buccal , distal palatal aspect teeth 16 , 15 , 14 , 13 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Adverse event like discoloration observe clinical examination ( yes/no ) clinically visible oral mucosal reaction register . In addition , Quigley Hine plaque index ; Turesky modification , register follow score method die Quadrant 1 Quadrant 2 . All clinical registration perform experienced periodontist , leave colleague register recording especially design chart . The clinical crew keep blind group allocation participant time , one access code-book statistician participate clinical event . Statistical analyse The total number participant 59 , 19 subject group 1 , 20 subject group 2 3 ( use two-sided t-test 5 % significance level ) ; test power detect true mean difference Gingival - Plaque index 80 % . This power analysis base variable delta plaque , mean difference mean plaque 1st 2nd quadrant ( test minus control quadrant ) . When compare mean variable delta plaque two group , two-sided independent sample t-test use , 5 % significance level . In present study sample size 15 patient group . Average standard deviation DP three group 0.40 . It may show test power detect mean difference least 0.40 present study compare two group 78 % . As 80 % test power generally consider acceptable clinical study difference mean variable Delta Plaque group 3 group 1 0.49 , calculation suggest study acceptable test power . Interval estimate primary efficacy variable construct use 95 % level confidence overall significance level 5 % used statistical test . All test perform two-sided . The statistical analysis conduct use software Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Windows , Version 16.0 . The difference group day 7 , 14 21 test use independent sample t-test . One-way Anova analysis use analyze outcome variable , consider interesting compare Alcohol - ( group 2 ) Essential Oils Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate - ( group 3 ) reference water group ( group 1 ) . The distribution outcome variable check hindsight , find sufficiently close normal distribution allow use t-test .</detailed_description>
