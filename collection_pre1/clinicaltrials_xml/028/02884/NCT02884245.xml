	<detailed_description>With advanced age , ovarian reserve decrease , follicular cohort become heterogeneous influence high FSH rise late luteal phase . It show estrogen ( E2 ) take late luteal phase homogenize follicular cohort inhibit inter cycle FSH peak , inhibition immediately reversible discontinuation treatment . E2 give late luteal phase also extend beyond onset menses period least eight day start stimulation , allow schedule stimulation order limit oocytes retrieval weekend . A prospective randomized study compare E2 schedule schedule show difference birth rate population normo-responders woman . While patient , number oocyte different two arm , recent pilot study found significant increase number oocytes retrieve E2 luteal phase priming compare absence prim population poor responder . In 2013 , report French governmental BioMedicine Agency warn thrombo-embolic risk associate use contraceptive pill IVF scheduling , especially woman 35 . Administration corifollitropin alfa , FSH extend release kinetics , seem particularly interesting synchronous recruitment follicle homogenization cohort . In Pursue study , equivalent efficacy show daily administration 300 IU FSH corifollitropin alfa patient 35 year . The objective study evaluate impact response ovarian stimulation corifollitropin alfa E2 schedule versus schedule woman 38 year , age decline ovarian reserve usually begin . The management patient term organization center also evaluate . The schedule IVF cycle represent double benefit . On one hand , enable `` synchronization '' follicular cohort best response high number mature oocytes . On hand , efficient organization center ( avoid retrieval weekend public holiday , organize distribute equally activity , reduce cost operation ) couple ( personal professional organization ) . This do pills controversial data impact chance birth . It show estrogen schedule provide opportunity success equivalent absence scheduling patient good prognosis . If study confirm initial hypothesis , show less favorable public profit benefit schedule estrogen organization attempt chance pregnancy well ovarian response .</detailed_description>
