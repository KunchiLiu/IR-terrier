	<detailed_description>Background : Cognitive side-effects antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) important component treatment tolerability , although physiologic mechanism associate cognitive effect poorly understood . Quantitative EEG neurophysiologic measure sensitive indicator central AED effect old AEDs , slow consistent diffuse encephalopathy , tend covary neuropsychological performance . EEG change generally sensitive neuropsychological test AEDs , demonstrate oxcarbazepine , phenytoin , carbamazepine , lamotrigine , levetiracetam . Recent evidence demonstrate cognitive effect agent explain simply diffuse reduction neuronal excitability . Older AEDs associate mild-to-moderate generalized cognitive effect decrease psychomotor speed , also accompany encephalopathic EEG pattern include increase spectral EEG power lower frequency band . Several new AEDs demonstrate pattern . Some reduce cognitive effect ; however , one new AEDs , topiramate ( TPM ) , also possess EEG encephalopathic pattern , actually produce great cognitive deficit many old AEDs . Although new AEDs tend favorable cognitive profile , TPM , indicate partial primary generalize epilepsy well migraine prophylaxis , increasingly prescribe wide range neuropsychiatric disorder include bipolar disorder , weight loss even eat disorder despite carry high risk neuropsychological impairment prominent effect verbal fluency . Although TPM 's effect verbal fluency may reflect widespread disruption frontal lobe function , TPM 's effect verbal fluency also interpret reflect general effect language . TPM multiple mechanism action include modification Na+ Ca2+ dependent action potential , enhancement gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -mediated receptor , inhibition kainate-mediated conductance glutamate receptor alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid ( AMPA ) /kainate type . In addition , TPM carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) II inhibitor , although function CA central nervous system ( CNS ) well-established , least CA isoenzymes ( CA II ) heavy human brain concentration oligodendrocytes myelin . Because TPM unique neuropsychological effect accompany quantitative spectral EEG component , generalize reduction neuronal excitation insufficient account TPM 's neuropsychological profile . Therefore , investigator investigate whether physiologic mechanism underlie TPM 's negative cognitive effect reflect altered pattern neuronal EEG connectivity follow single dose . TPM 's inhibitory effect carbonic anhydrase suggest mechanism cognitive impairment may relate white matter dysfunction alter neuronal connectivity . If true , TPM 's effect great generative fluency semantic-decision due disruption intentional system connectivity frontal lobe anterior cingulate brain region . Semantic-conceptual process semantic-decision unaffected . However , TPM multiple mechanism may contribute cognitive effect . If generalize `` frontal lobe '' effect present , similar TPM effect present work memory activation . EEG provide opportunity explore differential change functional connectivity associate AEDs function task . In addition , TPM appear significant selective effect word find verbal fluency minority patient n't manifest AEDs . As Goldstein et al point recent review , type heterogeneity response may part explain gene involve metabolism central response TPM . The investigator hypothesize physiological effect TPM cognition manifest functional network level , great reduction connectivity expect verbal fluency . The primary objective project characterize TPM 's effect work memory verbal fluency quantitative EEG record healthy volunteer . This study provide pilot data 1 ) demonstrate viability approach examine physiological effect AEDs relate language function , 2 ) perform formal power estimate calculation support longer-term connectivity study use stochastic modeling technique include power , coherence , Granger causality metric analyze AED effect quantitative EEG . The primary research goal project establish relationship single dose TPM quantitative cognitive EEG order investigate physiological mechanism underlie cognitive effect AEDs . Investigators examine neuronal network connectivity potential pharmacokinetic relationship individual physiological response . Specific Aim 1a . To determine change functional EEG connectivity follow single dose TPM compare placebo work memory task . The secondary research goal project collect preliminary data genetics TPM metabolism genetic influence TPM-induced change verbal fluency work memory . Specific Aim 2 . To investigate association genotype change verbal fluency work memory result take single 100 mg TPM versus placebo . Design : This double-blind , placebo-controlled , double crossover study design investigate physiologic effect single dose TPM ( 100 mg ) placebo cognition work memory . Subjects undergo cognitive EEG recording , neuropsychological test blood draw . Informed Consent : The nature research study possible risk explain potential subject . The subject make aware medical care contingent participation . Written inform consent obtain subject one co-investigators . Design Overview : On study day , subject initially direct University Florida ( UF ) Neuroinformatics Lab J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department Biomedical Engineering : - After sign informed consent , subject randomly assign study treatment sequence . All medication purchase UF Pharmacy . Subjects ask abstain alcoholic beverage over-the-counter medication least 48 hour prior test though permitted consume caffeinated beverage day assessment part standard morning routine . - After ask consent study , brief demographic , medical medication history take first visit assure subject currently medication interact either TPM . - Vital sign record . - Subject fit EEG electrode . On 2nd 3rd visit , study medication consume prior electrode placement . - After complete EEG record session ( approx . 2.5 hour ) , electrodes remove , Blood drawn serum concentration ( genetic sample take time first visit ONLY separate consent obtain ) . - The subject give small snack brief neuropsychological assessment ( ~ 20 minute ) administer blinded tester . This procedure repeat least one week apart study condition obtain . All test perform approximately time day . Subjects required arrange transportation home day follow completion experiment . EEG RECORDING AND WORKING MEMORY TASK The EEG portion project conduct Neuroinformatics Lab J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department Biomedical Engineering University Florida .
