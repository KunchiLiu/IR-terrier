	<brief_summary>The exact incidence subepithelial tumor ( SETs ) gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract unknown , prevalence gastric SETs detect routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy 0.36 % . GI SETs may include leiomyoma , GI stromal tumor ( GIST ) , schwannoma , lipoma , cyst , ectopic pancreas . Surgical resection principal diagnostic therapeutic method SETs , especially large symptomatic one . Preoperative pathological diagnosis SETs may facilitate clinical decision making , conventional endoscopic forceps biopsy yield adequate amount subepithelial tissue definitive diagnosis . Although endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) best image modality evaluation SETs , substitute histopathological diagnosis . EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) may provide adequate amount tissue diagnosis SETs , always afford adequate sample immunohistochemical analysis often small number cell obtain aspiration . Since SETs , especially GI mesenchymal tumor GIST schwannoma , vary morphologic appearance , diagnosis use small biopsy straightforward , immunohistochemical analysis strongly advisable , essential . EUS-guided Trucut biopsy ( EUS-TNB ) may overcome limitation EUS-FNA procuring sufficient core tissue specimen . Although EUS-TNB accurate EUS-FNA diagnosing GI mesenchymal tumor , rigidity 19-gauge ( G ) caliber mechanical friction fire mechanism produce torqued echoendoscope limit use SETs locate gastric antrum duodenum . Therefore , needle facilitate adequate histological core sample easy maneuverability need establish . A 19G EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy ( EUS-FNB ) device ProCore reverse-bevel technology recently introduce . A multicenter study reveal histological sample could successfully obtain use needle patient GI SETs , diagnostic accuracy &gt; 80 % .10 However , technical difficulty needle gastric antrum duodenum , FNB device recently develop 20 G platform coil sheath . This prospective , multicenter study aim evaluate feasibility , yield , diagnostic accuracy newly develop 20 G ProCore needle coil sheath patient GI SETs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients Methods Patients newly diagnose GI SETs prospectively enrol 8 university hospital Korea May December 2016 , meet follow criterion : hypoechoic mass submucosal and/or proper muscle layer basis EUS tumor &gt; 2 cm size . Exclusion criterion : SETs locate submucosal and/or proper muscle layer EUS ; EUS reveal characteristic finding lipoma , cyst , vessel extraluminal lesion ; platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 prothrombin time &lt; 50 % ; patient provide consent undergo study . This study approve Institutional Review Board hospital conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki amendment Good Clinical Practice guideline . All enrol patient provide write informed consent participate study . Technique EUS-FNB All procedure perform use linear array echoendoscope ( Olympus UCT-140 , UCT-240 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan PentaxEG-3870UTK ; Pentax , Tokyo , Japan ) patient place left lateral decubitus position conscious sedation . Before study commence , participate endosonographers discuss procedural step detail . Technical detail standard tissue-acquisition protocol follow . After target lesion endosonographically visualized region scan SETs use color pulse Doppler , FNB perform esophagus , stomach , duodenum rectum , depend lesion location . The needle advanced target tissue endosonographic guidance . After penetrate lesion , endosonographer move needle to-and-fro 10 15 time within lesion assistant simultaneously pull stylet slowly continuously 20 achieve minimal negative pressure within needle ( slow-pull technique ) . Finally , needle withdrawn lesion . At least three needle pass perform use designate needle , diagnostic technical failure encounter , patient switch alternative needle accord judgment endosonographers . Preparation histological analysis Because pathologist absent endoscopy , FNB sample recover stored subsequent processing endosonographers . The specimen express onto slide use stylet flush air needle assembly , harvest core sample needle . The endosonographers carefully inspect material slide presence tissue core define whitish piece tissue apparent bulk , measure lift slide place formalin bottle . The core sample macroscopically assess definite tissue core ; suspicious tissue core mixed blood clot ; blood scarce sample without tissue core . The former two sample type consider macroscopically optimal core sample . If tissue core obtain , fix formalin stain hematoxylin eosin evaluation pathologist . Samples tissue core grade optimal suboptimal : optimal , material allows satisfactory assessment histologic architecture immunohistochemical evaluation , c-kit , CD34 , S-100 , smooth muscle actin , indicate , suboptimal , histological core inadequate abovementioned assessment . Because morphological characteristic mesenchymal tumor nonspecific , positive diagnosis EUS-FNB consider true positive immunohistochemical analysis conclusive . Conventional cytological analysis additionally perform case core sample unavailable . Cytological material sent cytologist fix air-dried slide . The gold standard histopathological assessment resect specimens patient underwent endoscopic resection surgery , assessment FNB sample . Outcome parameters The primary outcome parameter diagnostic sufficiency . Diagnostic sufficiency define proportion patient histopathological diagnosis could establish within three needle pass . The percentage case pathologist classified quality sample optimal histological evaluation also evaluate . The secondary outcome measure rate diagnostic failure , technical failure , complication . Diagnostic failure define failure obtain sufficient core sample even three pass , technical failure define malfunction needle three needle pass . Complications define deviation clinical course EUS-guided sampling , observe endosonographers recovery suite nurse , report patient . Excessive bleeding site puncture , perforation , hypotension , need reversal medication document .</detailed_description>
