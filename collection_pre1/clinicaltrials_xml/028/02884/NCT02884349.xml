	<detailed_description>Ninety patient clinic single consultant orthopaedic surgeon , list total hip arthroplasty recruit study . They surgery perform participate consultant per standard practice target study patient . This involve use Excia T cementless stem , ceramic femoral head , Plasmafit Plus cementless liner Biolox delta acetabular cup B Braun Medical Ltd . The participate consultant routinely use computer aid orthopaedic surgery ( CAOS ) techniques implant stem acetabular cup study patient surgery use technique . Participants standard in-patient care rehabilitation . Standard hospital practice hip arthroplasty patient return hospital post-operative review three month . During appointment review member arthroplasty team two radiograph take , anterior/posterior view full pelvis lateral view index hip . Study participant return three month post-operative review see arthroplasty team standard , two radiograph take . Instead , compute tomography ( CT ) scan take full pelvis . In addition standard clinical outcome data collect , Participants also complete Harris Hip Score range motion questionnaire . Study participant also additional assessment part three month post-operative review . In movement analysis laboratory Golden Jubilee National Hospital , undergo RoM assessment use clinical movement analysis technique . During assessment , participant ask fully flex/extend hip joint , fully abduct/adduct , fully internally/externally rotate finally fully circumduct . While perform task , hip joint movement track number infrared camera identify small reflective marker attach body . A computer convert data three dimensional RoM data analysis . At end three month post-operative review , participant 's involvement study complete . The computer use CAOS capable measure on-table range motion ( RoM ) hip . This data collect purpose study . Mathematical method use determine theoretical RoM hip CT scan . The data movement analysis session give actual RoM . The CT scan analyse determine inclination version acetabular cup torsion femoral stem . From , combine anteversion ( CA ) cup/stem system determine . Comparison make CA actual RoM determine extent , , CA influence RoM . Comparisons make on-table RoM theoretical RoM , actual RoM ass accuracy method use determine on-table theoretical RoMs .</detailed_description>
