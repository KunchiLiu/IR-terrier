	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize airflow obstruction , induce flow limitation . As consequence , observe patient increase end expiratory lung volume positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEPi ) end normal expiration . Patients breathe high pulmonary volume : concept static hyperinflation . This worsen breathe pattern situation , work breathing increase dyspnea increase . The application continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) show improve static hyperinflation decrease work breathing . Sleep deteriorate COPD patient , causal factor include static hyperinflation , cough , depression . Moreover , normal physiological change occur sleep COPD patient lead deterioration gaseous exchange . The purpose study assess effect nocturnal CPAP sleep quality functional respiratory parameter .</detailed_description>
