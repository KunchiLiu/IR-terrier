	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect multiple dos itraconazole , potent cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYP3A ) inhibitor , pharmacokinetics PF-06648671 follow single dose administration healthy subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label , 2 Treatment Period , Study To Study The Drug Interaction Between Repeated Doses Of Itraconazole And Single Dose Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Of PF-06648671 In Healthy Adults .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based vitro data , PF-06648671 predominantly metabolize CYP3A therefore potential risk PF-06648671 PK affect co-administered drug inhibit CYP3A activity . This clinical drug interaction study evaluate potential drug interaction human . In study , healthy volunteer take single dose 25 mg PF-06648671 period 1 follow least 7 day washout . In period 2 , subject take 200 mg itraconazole oral solution day 3 day , follow co-administration 200 mg oral solution single dose 25 mg PF-06648671 day 4 dose approximately one hour apart itraconazole give first . The PF-06648671 PK collect 0-48 hour dose period 1 0-240 hr period 2 . Safety also monitor throughout period .</detailed_description>

Screening supine blood pressure &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , follow least 5 minute supine rest . If blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , BP repeat two time average three BP value use determine subject 's eligibility . 8 . Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating correct QT ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec QRS interval &gt; 120 msec . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . 9 . Subjects ANY follow abnormality clinical laboratory test Screening AND Day 0 , assess study specific laboratory confirm single repeat , deem necessary : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) / serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) &gt; 1x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Total bilirubin &gt; =1.5 x ULN ; subject history Gilbert 's syndrome may direct bilirubin measure would eligible study provide direct bilirubin ULN . 10 . Fertile male subject unwilling unable use highly effective method contraception outline protocol duration study least 28 day , long base upon compound 's half life characteristic , last dose investigational product . 11 . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose investigational product . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos 1 g/day . Limited use non prescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit case case basis follow approval sponsor . 12 . History hepatitis positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) , hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb ) hepatitis C antibody ( HCV ) .
