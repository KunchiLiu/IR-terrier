	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well carboplatin paclitaxel without atezolizumab surgery work treat patient newly diagnose , stage II-III triple negative breast cancer . Monoclonal antibody , atezolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving carboplatin paclitaxel without atezolizumab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Atezolizumab Before Surgery Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed , Stage II-III Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis combination chemotherapy atezolizumab increase tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) percentage compare chemotherapy alone patient newly diagnose triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis combination chemotherapy atezolizumab increase pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate compare chemotherapy alone patient newly diagnose TNBC treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential biomarkers response chemotherapy combination atezolizumab patient newly diagnose TNBC . II . To evaluate impact chemotherapy combination atezolizumab immune response patient newly diagnose TNBC . III . To evaluate impact chemotherapy combination atezolizumab neoantigen-specific T cell responses patient newly diagnose TNBC . IV . To evaluate impact chemotherapy combination atezolizumab long-term clinical endpoint overall survival ( OS ) disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient newly diagnose TNBC . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute , paclitaxel IV 1 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , within 3-6 week , patient undergo mastectomy lumpectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
