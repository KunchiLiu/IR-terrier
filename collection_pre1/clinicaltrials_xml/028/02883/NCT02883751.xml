	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus major public health problem estimate 300 million individual affect year 2030 . Non-diabetic ulcer one frequent complication disease , untreated , lead amputation lower limb . Thus , grow interest use light emit diode ( LED ) device accelerate tissue repair process low cost ulcer treatment population . The Mandaqui hospital complex general , tertiary , teach hospital reference center revascularization surgery endovascular treatment Brazil . The aim propose study evaluate action LED therapy complete heal ulcer follow minor amputation patient Diabetes mellitus . Methods : A single-center , randomize , control , double-blind , clinical trial two parallel group conduct follow criterion CONSORT Statement . The project register www.clinicaltrials.gov . The sample compose 40 patient diagnosis Diabetes mellitus follow vascular clinic Mandaqui hospital complex meet inclusion criterion . The control group ( n = 20 ) receive traditional rayon bandage essential fatty acid secondary coverage gauze , change weekly basis . The treatment group ( n = 20 ) submit LED therapy ( 635 nm ; 4 J/cm2 ; 10 minute ) weekly application ulcer also receive traditional bandage treatment describe . The patient follow complete closure ulcer , primary outcome . The ulcer examine weekly basis researcher awareness regard allocation individual different group ass , sign infection , edema , redness , heat presence gangrene . Photographs ulcer also take subsequent determination area . Another researcher knowledge regard allocation participant measure surface ulcer aid ImageJ software program . The data submit appropriate statistical analysis . After closure ulcer , patient follow period six month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phototherapy DM Amputation Ulcers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification Various study demonstrate phototherapy ( laser LED ) effective enhance skin wound . The biological effect form similar related increase fibroblast , stimulation angiogenesis , increase collagen synthesis , formulation granulation tissue reduction inflammatory cell . Moreover , form phototherapy increase heal area shorter period time , LED demonstrate late-onset effect heal process . In patient partial foot amputation , time crucial fitting prosthetic , consequently , begin physical therapy early locomotion . Diminishing treatment time , patient observe gradual progression heal process experience consequent increase quality life , could transform factor avoid recurrence ulcer avoid amputation . Hypothesis Alternative hypothesis : LED therapy effective potentiating complete closure ulcer short time follow minor amputation individual Diabetes mellitus . Hull hypothesis : LED therapy effective potentiating complete closure ulcer short time follow minor amputation individual Diabetes mellitus . Methods A single-center , randomize , control , double-blind clinical trial two parallel group conduct accordance criterion contain Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT statement ) . The sample compose patient diagnose Diabetes mellitus medical follow vascular outpatient clinic Mandaqui Hospital Complex SÃ£o Paulo . Twenty patient analyze group , estimate surgical treatment vascular surgeon one-year period Mandaqui Hospital Complex . Randomization formation group Patient allocation perform researcher contact patient main researcher . Randomization conduct block four balance distribution experimental group . For , lottery 40 number conduct use free program available http : //www.randomization.com , version March 29 , 2013 . Opaque envelop identify sequential number . A piece paper contain information correspond group determine randomization process ( control LED ) place envelope . The envelope remain sealed numeric order secure location time treatment post-amputation ulcer . The researcher charge randomization process preparation envelop involve aspect study . Immediately follow surgery , main researcher , surgical ward , open envelope without alter numeric sequence perform procedure indicate ( active LED + bandage placebo LED + bandage ) . The 40 patient allocated experimental control group equal fashion .</detailed_description>
