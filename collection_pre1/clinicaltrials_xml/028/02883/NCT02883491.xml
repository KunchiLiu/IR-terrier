	<brief_summary>The overall goal clinical research study prospectively assess primary outcome related pulmonary embolism ( PE ) occur immediately ( within 5 day ) within 30 day . The secondary goal compare validate prediction model modify European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) approach primarily right ventricle dysfunction ( RVD ) driven clinical risk assessment secondary , primary outcomes clinical deterioration within 5 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Embolism Short-term Clinical Outcomes Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator wish develop Pulmonary Embolism Short-term Clinical Outcomes Registry ( PE-SCOR ) . The investigator also wish determine incidence death circulatory respiratory deterioration , administration reperfusion therapy within 5 day PE patient . The study also evaluate sensitivity , specificity positive negative predictive value RVD assessment option . The investigator also derive prediction model PE patient primary outcome within five day . Finally , investigator determine functional outcome PE patient 30 day PE .</detailed_description>
