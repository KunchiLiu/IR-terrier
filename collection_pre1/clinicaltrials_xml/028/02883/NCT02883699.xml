	<brief_title>Individually Tailored Training Prescriptions Cancer Patients : The TOP Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TOP Study two-stage study individually tailor endurance resistance training prescription breast prostate cancer patient end primary therapy order optimize training effect . The TOP Study Part I aim identify appropriate way individual intensity prescription . In descriptive cross sectional study , 20 breast 20 prostate cancer patient perform singe endurance resistance training session prescribe mean different method intensity prescription . The appropriate method intensity prescription identify consider predictability/homogeneity physiological response well perceive exertion enjoyment . The TOP Study Part II aim investigate effective training method term enhance physical fitness endurance strength training . The design exploratory four-arm 12-week randomize controlled training intervention trial 60 breast 60 prostate cancer patient . In two endurance arm , vigorous continuous training compare polarized program consist moderate training aerobic high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) . Similarly , two resistance training arm , standard machine base hypertrophy training compare training follow daily undulating periodization design .</detailed_description>
