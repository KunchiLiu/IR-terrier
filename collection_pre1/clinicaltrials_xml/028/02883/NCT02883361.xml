	<brief_title>Motivational Enhancement Therapy Improve Adherence Aromatase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The use Aromatase Inhibitors ( AIs ) among breast cancer ( BC ) patient hormone receptor-positive disease reduces recurrence 41 % mortality 31 % . Despite efficacy AIs , one-quarter BC survivor fail take AIs prescribed first year another one-fifth discontinuing later treatment . There variety reason non-adherence , include low motivation , poor patient-provider communication , low self-efficacy , low perceive risk , experience side effect . One promise intervention improve treatment adherence motivational interviewing ( MI ) , broad set patient-centered technique design enhance motivation behaviour change . Objectives : To conduct parallel-group , double-blind , randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate efficacy MI improve 12-month adherence AIs relative attention control ( AC ) . The primary outcome medication adherence measure use pharmacy record calculate medication possession ratio ( MPR ) . Secondary outcome include self-reported adherence , motivation self-efficacy . Methods : A community sample BC survivor newly prescribe AIs recruit local cancer centre pharmacy 6-month medication adherence observation period . The investigator choose recruit new AI user significant number ( i.e. , 20-35 % ) expect discontinue medication within 12-months . MPR calculate follow observation period patient meet inclusion criterion deem non-adherent ( MPR &lt; 80 % ) enrol trial , randomly assign MI AC , schedule baseline appointment . Recruitment continue 128 ( 64 per group ) non-adherent BC survivor identify . Four MI AC session deliver 3-month interval ( 0-,3-,6-,9-months ) , last 30-45 minute . A final assessment occur 12-months . Baseline final assessment conduct assistant affiliate trial . Given long-term adherence AIs poor , lack adherence lead clinically meaningful increase BC recurrence , morbidity mortality , one publish intervention study relate AIs date , trial represent top priority prevention treatment BC .</detailed_description>
