	<detailed_description>Hypo-fractionation ( several large fraction radiation treatment ) breast cancer irradiation common forty 50 , successful achieve tumor control , find leave significantly inferior cosmetic result due severe fibrosis telangiectasia compare obtain multiple fraction regimen ( 38-40 ) . These complication due use large field , inclusion large proportion uninvolved skin tissue surround tumor . Based assumption , large fraction safely deliver breast cancer provide 1 ) target volume sufficiently small 2 ) radiation technique assure maximum spar surround normal tissue . Conformal RT tumor bed T1 breast cancer satisfy requirement .</detailed_description>
