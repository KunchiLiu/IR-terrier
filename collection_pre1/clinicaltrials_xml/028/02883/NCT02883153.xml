	<brief_title>Zirconium-89-girentuximab PET/CT Imaging Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More advanced imaging method need reliably distinguish benign small renal mass ( SRM ) renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) prevent invasive biopsy unnecessary surgery . Similarly , improve imaging method need unambiguous detection lesion suspect metastatic relapse RCC follow-up . Girentuximab antibody Carbonic Anhydrase IX ( CAIX ) , antigen express cell surface 95 % clear cell RCC ( ccRCC ) . Zr-89-girentuximab PET/CT may valuable image technique diagnosis patient RCC . The aim present study show impact Zr-89-girentuximab PET/CT clinical management ccRCC patient . Thirty patient include conventional diagnostics inconclusive . During multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) hypothetical next step clinical process note ( e.g . diagnostics , treatment active surveillance ) . Subsequently , patient Zirconium-89-girentuximab PET/CT perform . Patients receive single intravenous dose 5 mg Zirconium-89-girentuximab ( 37 MBq ) . A PET/CT scan acquire 4 5 day injection . The Zirconium-89-girentuximab PET/CT read clinician extensive experience radiolabeled girentuximab imaging . The result PET/CT discuss MDT use decide next step clinical process . This step compare hypothetical next step MDT scan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order participate study , subject must meet following criterion : 1 . His clinician face diagnostic dilemma ; e.g . patient renal mass unknown origin , patient primary renal mass unclear whether metastatic disease , patient history clear cell RCC suspicion relapse metastatic disease . 2 . Minimum age 18 year 3 . Signed informed consent History CAIXnegative non clear cell RCC . Administration tyrosine kinase inhibiters within 1 month prior inclusion . Any medical condition present opinion investigator affect patient ' clinical status . Administration radioisotope within 10 physical half live prior study enrollment Pregnancy lactation . Known hypersensitivity HACA ( human anti chimeric antibody ) Girentuximab .</criteria>
