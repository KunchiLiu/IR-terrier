	<brief_summary>Capillary malformation ( port-wine stain ) consist abnormally develop capillary blood vessel skin . To date , laser therapy widely accept treatment modality capillary malformation , therapy suboptimal effect approximately 50-60 % patient . Intralesional bleomycin injection ( sclerotherapy ) common effective treatment option vascular malformation blood vessel large diameter . However , bleomycin inject adequately small sized vessel capillary malformation . The use electric field tissue ( electroporation ) may solve problem : increase cell membrane permeability therefore promote localized delivery drug , within ( endothelial ) cell . Electroporation combination bleomycin sclerotherapy ( 'electrosclerotherapy ' ) may therefore offer new therapeutic option capillary malformation . This proof principle study aim explore effectiveness , safety feasibility potential treatment option within-patient-controlled pilot study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Capillary malformation congenital abnormality capillary skin . These abnormally develop blood vessel cause red color skin ( also know 'port-wine stain ' ) , often combination cobble-stone like aspect skin . Currently , widely accept treatment option laser therapy , abnormal blood vessel target photocoagulation . However , approximately 50-60 % patient , treatment outcome laser therapy suboptimal . Furthermore , re-darkening capillary malformation often occur laser therapy . Hence , need alternative treatment option - especially treatment-resistant recurrent capillary malformation . Intralesional bleomycin injection ( sclerotherapy ) common treatment option vascular malformation blood vessel lymphatic vessel large diameter ( venous lymphatic malformation ) . According literature , treatment effective approximately 80-90 % patient . Unfortunately , diameter capillary blood vessel small , therefore adequate localized injection bleomycin possible capillary malformation . 'Electroporation ' physical phenomenon cause alteration structure cell membrane exposure cell short intense electric field ; modification cell membrane increase permeability . After electroporation , molecule normally cross cell membrane , either diffusion active transport , reach intracellular environment . Therefore , electroporation ideal method localize drug delivery , particular localize bleomycin delivery . The combination electroporation bleomycin already use variety skin lesion , squamous cell carcinoma , surprisingly high rate complete remission . Especially vascular tumor , Kaposi sarcoma , extremely high percentage complete remission ( 90 % ) , since combination bleomycin electroporation cause 'vascular lock ' intravascular thrombosis tumor vascularization , lead tumor regression . This phenomenon ( intravascular thrombosis lesion regression ) exactly intend effect capillary malformation treatment . The investigator therefore hypothesize intralesional bleomycin injection combine electroporation ( electrosclerotherapy ) alternative treatment option capillary malformation . This proof principle study aim explore feasibility potential treatment option small patient sample .</detailed_description>
