	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy Severe Asthma Oxyhydrogen Generator With Nebulizer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The oxyhydrogen generator nebulizer ( treatment group ) control group apply randomly patient severe asthma study , therapeutic effect treatment control group analyze evaluated verify safety effectiveness.This study multi-center , randomize , double-blind study . Each patient expect participate trial 104±3 day.The screening period 14±1 day , subject would continue apply previous asthma treatment scheme . The primary objective collect baseline data relate subjects.The patient would receive 30±1 day treatment product ; , observation 60±1 day required.Total patient number 150 case , 75 case treatment group others control group.All case respectively distribute 5 clinical hospital .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age range : ≥18 year old ≤65 year old ; sex unlimited ; 2 . The subject require suffer asthma 6 month least clinical diagnosis respirologist base international standard ( GINA2012 ) .There support one follow objective evidence screen treatment five year treatment : It positive reaction methacholine provocative test ( patient apply inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) require PC20 &lt; 8mg/mL PD20 &lt; 0.7mg ; patient apply ICS require PC20 &lt; 16mg/mL PD20 &lt; 1.4mg ) ; The airway reversibility test , positive reaction , define asΔFEV1.0 % basis FEV1.0≥200mL 30 minute 400μgsalbutamol aerosol ( miststoring bottle might use deliberately ) inhale ; ③ The peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) aberration rate &gt; 20 % ( , difference average value maximum minimum PEFs time 100 ) ; measure seven day successively ; The reaction record asthma maintenance treatment one course treatment ( e.g . four week ) ( define ΔFEV1.0 absolute value≥200mL ) ; 3 . According severe asthma diagnosis : The drug therapy require Level4 5 asthma accord GINA Guide past year ( The large dose ICS combine LABA leukotriene modifier/theophyline ) , systemic corticosteroid treatment last ≥50 % time prevent `` uncontrollable '' asthma ; `` uncontrollable '' asthma still occur even treatment . The uncontrollable asthma meet one follow requirement least : Symptom control difference : ACQ &gt; 1.5 , ACT &lt; 20 ( `` Nongood control '' GINA Guide ) ; Frequent severe attack : Receiving systemic corticosteroid treatment twice past year ( three day time ) ; ③ Serious attack : Hospitalizing ICU mechanical ventilation least past year ; ④ Airway limitation : After bronchodilator stop properly , FEVl.0 % &lt; 80 % ( FEV/FVC decrease less low limit normal value ) . The controlled asthma deteriorate decrement large dose ICS systemic corticosteroid ( combine biologic agent ) ; 4 . The subject legal agent could understand trial objective , demonstrate compliance trail scheme , sign Informed Consent Form . 1 . The subject body mass index＞38kg/m2 , weight＜40kg ; 2 . The subject ' smoking amount &gt; 10 package time year number ( e.g . number cigarettes × number year smoking/20 ) ; 3 . Based clinical interview , experience screen inspection result , subject participate trial improperly doctor responsible trial believe risk participate trial , research result affect ; 4 . The subject recreational drug abuse history allergic history , doctor responsible trial believe subject limited history could participate trial ; 5 . The woman subject pregnancy suckle period , six week least delivery , stop breastfeed six week . If woman subject find pregnant receive one inspection , , inspection data item reject analysis ; 6 . The subject ever participate study new drug drug , within 3 month first administration , every participate one research involve invasive operation within 3 month . Any research evaluation put three month later first administration invasive operation participate research . It approve steer committee subject participate research include trial group continue participate research ; 7 . The investigator believe subject show risk noncompliance research procedures ; 8 . The subject mental disease history result loss active ability recent period ; 9 . The following disease history evidence demonstrate within two week baseline assessment subject suffer upper low respiratory infection relate symptom ( include common cold ) ( assessment put ) ; 10 . The subject change asthmatic drug within four week screen ; 11 . The subject suffer asthma attack month prior ( administer systemic corticosteroid temporarily increase oral corticosteroid three day stable base dose least ) ; 12 . Other important diagnosis possibly similar asthma complicate asthma , especially respiratory dysfunction , panic attack evident social psychological problem ( diagnosis see patient 's main symptom rather symptom except severe asthma ) ; 13 . Other severe primary pulmonary disease , especially pulmonary embolism , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial pulmonary disease lung cancer ; 14 . The subject emphysema bronchiectasis exclude diagnosis consider main symptom rather symptom except severe asthma ; 15 . The subject diagnose chronic inflammatory disease ( inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis ) except asthma .</criteria>
