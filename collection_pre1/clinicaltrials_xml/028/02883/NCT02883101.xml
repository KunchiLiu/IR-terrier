	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY Type study - Randomised control trial ( RCT ) Study period - March 2014 July 2016 Place study - Department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep Disorders , All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi Study group - Bronchiectasis attributable Cystic fibrosis - Group 1 - Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) - Group 2 - Standard care Sample size - 20 arm The study require patient attend pulmonary rehabilitation program twice week 8 week . Consent take patient prior enrollment . Exacerbations bronchiectasis define follow criterion : At least four follow clinical sign symptom suggestive acute exacerbation bronchiectasis two consecutive day : - Increase sputum quantity - Change sputum colour - Change sputum viscosity - Increase cough - Increase dyspnoea - Increase fatigue/lethargy - Fever ( self-reported ) - Episode haemoptysis The number acute pulmonary exacerbation per year previous year record . All patient attend patient department pulmonary department All India Institute Medical Sciences screen recruitment study . Baseline evaluation All patient qualify study undergo detailed evaluation . This include demographic data , complete medical history clinical examination include anthropometry . Baseline assessment include follow parameter : i. Anthropometry ii . Pulmonary Function Tests Respiratory muscle strength iii . Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( CPET ) iv . Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) v. Severity dyspnoea ( Dyspnoea scale ) vi . Limb muscle strength vii . Inflammatory marker serum - C-reactive protein viii . Quality Life The participant randomly assign receive either standard care alone pulmonary rehabilitation . The randomisation complete creation random number table . Intervention Standard care group Candidates randomize `` standard care group '' receive standard care bronchiectasis accord current guideline . These participant receive instruction review airway clearance therapy ( ACT ) . Each participant provide write information bronchiectasis education regard self-management condition . Participants previously instruct ACT teach active cycle breathing technique . These participant receive supervise exercise training . Pulmonary rehabilitation group Participants randomise Pulmonary Rehabilitation group receive exercise training regular instruction self-management ACT along standard care . Patients enrol pulmonary rehabilitation programme , Department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep disorder , All India Institute Medical Sciences . The total duration programme would 8 week , thrice weekly session exercise train 1 hour duration . Of session , least 2 supervise one home . The patient ask maintain personal log record date , time , duration type exercise perform ensure compliance , regularly review monitor . The Rehabilitation Programme include follow : . Patient education ii . Exercise training iii . Ventilator breathe exercise Outcome Assessment The patient reassess end 8 week training programme . Primary outcome measure : - Maximum exercise capacity - measure 6MWT ( primary outcome great distance walk ) CPET ( VO2 max ) - HRQoL measure St. George Respiratory Questionnaire Secondary outcome measure : - Change Leicester Cough Questionnaire - Change C- reactive protein - Change lung Functions - Change anxiety depression score - Change hand grip dynamometry</detailed_description>
