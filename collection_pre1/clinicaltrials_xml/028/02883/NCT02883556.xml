	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab First Line Therapy Patients With Unresectable Squamous Cell Carcinoma Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Agents block Programmed Cell Death 1 ( PD1 ) /Programmed Cell Death 1-Ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) pathway demonstrate objective , durable tumor regression patient advance solid malignancy efficacy link PD-L1 expression . PD-L1 expression tumour cell strongest single predictor response anti-PD1 therapy ( J Taube , R Anders et al , Clin Cancer Res 2014 ) . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) high-affinity humanized monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody . It lead dual PD1-ligand blockade PD-L1 PD-L2 may reactivate immune surveillance elicit anti-tumour response . It antitumor activity melanoma NSCLC ( phase III trial ) . Pembrolizumab might interest unresectable squamous cell carcinoma skin ( SCCS ) . Approximately 20 % 30 % non-melanoma skin cancer SCCS . Most patient primary SCCS excellent prognosis , SCCS progress advance stage impossible treat surgical excision radiotherapy . Few therapeutic option available tumor . Conventional chemotherapy , cisplatin-based combination , efficacy , toxic effect combination often prohibit use elderly patient . Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGFR ) signal antagonist activity subset patient . New therapeutic option need patient advanced SCCS . No trial evaluate pembrolizumab human SCCS ongoing . Investigators hypothesize : ) PD-L1 express SCCS HNSCC ii ) pembrolizumab may effective single agent patient unresectable SCCS iii ) Efficacy pembrolizumab correlate PD-L1 expression SCCS . Investigators therefore intend determine efficacy safety single agent pembrolizumab patient patient PD-L1-positive unresectable SCCS naïve chemotherapy EGFR inhibitor .</detailed_description>

Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week 5 halflives ( minimum 14 day ) , whichever short , prior first dose treatment . Has receive prior therapy either chemotherapy target therapy present tumor Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has receive radiation therapy within 4 week prior study Day 1 Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment .

Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , Fluenz tetra® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has know additional malignancy . Exceptions include ) basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , ii ) history another non blood malignancy undergone potentially curative therapy without recurrence 2 year . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least eight week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability .
