	<detailed_description>Asthma common disorder cause great deal distress patient , occasionally result premature death . Approximately 10 % people asthma severe disease help current treatments; The Investigators need find new treatment patient urgently . Patients asthma , distinct feature characterise asthma.The Investigators therefore hypothesise asthma single disease , syndrome result several distinct underlying disease process know endotypes . There approximately 30,000 gene human , gene responsible production particular protein . Using technique call `` whole genome expression profile '' The Investigators undertake small study look activity 30,000 gene airway tissue people asthma .
