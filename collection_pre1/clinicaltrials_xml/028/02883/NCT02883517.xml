	<brief_summary>To evaluate possibility detect cell-free circulate tumoral DNA potentially aggressive primary cutaneous lymphoma , investigator opt search representative tumor sample mutation blood patient , digital PCR . Patients mycosis fungoides , primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma helper follicular phenotype primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , leg-type include 4 blood sample collect 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary cutaneous lymphoma represent second extra nodal localization lymphoma , constitute T-cell B-cell phenotype lymphoma . Mycosis fungoides , T-cell epidermotropic lymphoma , frequent . Its clinical behavior usually indolent patient aggressive evolution . Among B-cell cutaneous lymphoma , primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , leg type ( PCDLBCL-LT ) aggressive . Cytogenetic molecular study tumours lead genetic characterization entity . Therefore , biologic marker help monitoring lymphoma . In solid tumor , mutation exhibit tumour tissue detect plasma patient , assess possibility detect cell-free circulate tumoral DNA blood sample , correlation clinical characteristic metastatic outcome . The concept liquid biopsy , allow detection tumour mutation plasma validate nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . That 's purpose evaluate possibility detect cell-free circulate tumoral DNA primary cutaneous lymphoma , use highly sensitive method ( digital PCR ) , combine next generation sequence panel tumour sample .</detailed_description>
