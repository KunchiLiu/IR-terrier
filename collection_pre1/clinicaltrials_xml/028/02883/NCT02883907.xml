	<brief_summary>The utility conventional imaging development new treatment osteoarthritis ( OA ) hinder : 1 . Difficulty non-invasively evaluate initial response potential new treatment option . OA typically develop long time period , evaluate efficacy new treatment option timeframe relevant experimental medicine study difficult . 2 . Inadequate method disease quantification stratification . OA heterogeneous condition identify subgroup patient likely benefit new treatment crucial . Novel magnetic resonance ( MR ) image acquisition analysis techniques potential solve problem . However , reliability need fully establish knowledge likely effect size require inform sample size consideration longitudinal/interventional study . This study aim help address issue : 1 . Calculating effect size MR measurement inform sample size calculation future study . 2 . Assessing reliability multiparametric MR protocol assessment knee joint . The investigator examine single knee initial 15 participant MR . Participants draw two group : ( 1 ) 10 participant age 40-60 year old clinical x-ray feature OA ( 2 ) 5 control subject ( match case age , sex body mass index 1:2 ratio ) clinical feature OA . Participants undergo initial ( baseline ) MR examination , follow repeat MR examination approximately 1 month 1 year follow baseline examination . This allow u assess reliability MR measurement expect progression MR measurement OA subject absence disease-modifying intervention .</brief_summary>
