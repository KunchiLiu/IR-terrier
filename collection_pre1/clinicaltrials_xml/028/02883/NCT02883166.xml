	<brief_summary>Abiraterone selective inhibitor androgen biosynthesis potently irreversibly block CYP17 , crucial enzyme testosterone estrogen synthesis . A pro-drug abiraterone , abiraterone acetate ( Zytiga® ) , develop overcome poor bio-availability fully convert active moiety abiraterone . Abiraterone acetate tablet administer fixed oral dose 1000mg QD fast state combination 10mg prednisolon daily . Abiraterone acetate low solubility aqueous medium low permeability . The bioavailability abiraterone acetate significantly influence ingest food . Ingesting abiraterone acetate low fat high fat meal result respectively 5- 10-fold increase AUC0-∞ . The high low fat FDA meal use food effect study differ largely breakfast take everyday life ( ca . 800-1000 cal ) . A continental breakfast contain 160 320 calorie 25-50 % fat , compatible normal lifestyle therefore easily sustainable daily practice . However , effect continental breakfast absorption abiraterone unknown yet . Furthermore , increase healthcare cost grow concern developed country . Therefore effort invest keep anticancer treatment affordable . A food intervention result good absorption enhance exposure abiraterone , lead reduce dose , could significantly impact health care cost tumor prevalent metastatic prostate cancer . Therefore investigator want perform bioequivalent study investigate dose abiraterone continental breakfast equal dose 1000mg take fasted condition .</brief_summary>
