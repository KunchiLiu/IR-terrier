	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial , follow evaluate 120 kidney transplant recipient one year . There two group : control group intervention group . The dietitian visit happen monthly first six month twice last six months.The intervention group receive high-protein low glycemic index diet ( 1,3g/kg/day protein ) control group keep follow hospital standard protocol . The study assessment ( weight , anthropometry biochemistry ) perform visit one year randomization period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect High Protein Low Glycemic Index Diet Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation great renal replacement therapy , compare dialysis , associate well quality life reduce cost time . However , well know significant weight gain obesity common kidney transplantation , mainly first year transplant . Besides , obesity risk factor development cardiovascular complication , new-onset diabetes transplantation associate graft loss . The use immunosuppressive medication , break dietary restriction associate dialysis period improvement appetite acceptable cause weight gain . However , lack evidence effective nutritional intervention prevent weight gain kidney transplant . In context , well know high-protein low glycemic index diet effective body weight loss subsequent weight maintenance . Moreover , protein generally exert well satiety effect carbohydrates lipid . So , consider need develop effective intervention minimize negative impact weight gain obesity kidney transplant outcome , randomize clinical trial , evaluate effect high protein low glycemic index diet ( nutritional intervention ) likely effective prevent weight gain kidney transplantation . This study randomize clinical trial , follow evaluate kidney transplant recipient one year transplantation . There two group : control group ( 60 patient ) intervention group ( 60 patient ) . The dietitian visit happen monthly first six month twice last six month . The study assessment ( weight , anthropometry , body composition biochemistry ) perform visit . Potential participant identify initial two month follow transplantation . Eligible transplant recipient invited participate , give detailed information trial , agreeable , ask provide write informed consent . Participants randomize receive either nutrition intervention high-protein low glycemic index diet standard nutrition protocol . This randomization perform statistical consultant use randomization.com site . The length study 1 year patient , assessment anthropometry , include measure weight ( monthly ) body composition ( every three month ) perform one specialist renal dietitian . Laboratory staff perform laboratory test , include serum urine creatinine ( monthly ) , glycemia , cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , glycated hemoglobin uric acid ( three month ) , high-sensitivity C- reactive protein ( baseline 6th month ) 24-h urine test albumin , protein , creatinine urea excretion ( every three month intervention group baseline , 3rd , 6th 12th month control group ) . Demographic clinical data assess first dietitian visit . Body weight height patient obtain body mass index ( BMI ) ( kg/m2 ) calculate . Waist circumference measure midway low rib margin iliac crest , flexible , nonstretched fiberglass tape . This evaluation make every visit ( monthly first 6 month twice last 6 month ) . Body fat percentage ( assessed three month ) measure use tetrapolar bioimpedance basal metabolic rate evaluate indirect calorimetry baseline 6 month later . All anthropometric assessment perform patient fasting , wear light clothing , without contact metal without shoe . The prescription diet calculate use nutritional table software version . It consider 1,3g /kg/day protein glycemic index estimate glucose standard food . Energy intake assessed 24-h recall day dietitian visit research dietitian . Diet composition also analyze use nutritional table software make every visit . Satiety level assess three month intervention group baseline control group use visual analogue scale appetite .</detailed_description>
