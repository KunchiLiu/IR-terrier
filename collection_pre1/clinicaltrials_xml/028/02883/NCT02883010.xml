	<brief_summary>Surgical Site Complications ( SSC 's ) responsible increase morbidity patient undergo surgery result prolonged length stay hospital increase treatment hospital cost dramatically . Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) use close incision report literature reduce SSC 's include Surgical Site Infections ( SSI 's ) , many promise study general surgery , include study use single use NPWT . However , date , randomise control trial ( RCT 's ) use intervention . When use PICOTM ( NPWT ) indication , patient may discharge hospital earlier , negative pressure incision management place . This implication term cost saving health care system enable patient able return normal daily routine quickly . The hypothesis study PICO NPWT reduce frequency SSC 's , 30 day follow period , compare standard care patient undergoing colorectal procedure .</brief_summary>
