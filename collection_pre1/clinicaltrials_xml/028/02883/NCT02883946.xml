	<brief_summary>Hairy-cell leukemia rare indolent lymphoid disorder , represent 2 % case lymphoid leukemia . Treatment hairy-cell leukemia relies mainly purine analog , cladribine pentostatin , show similar efficacy constitute gold standard care either front-line therapy relapse patient . However , despite remarkable response rate obtain purine analog therapy , patient eventually relapse efficacy agent seem decrease line treatment . The addition new molecule purine analog may improve response rate prevent relapse . Rituximab chimeric IgG1 kappa-type monoclonal antibody direct CD20 molecule . It first use relapsed patient hairy-cell leukemia 10 year ago several series patient treat rituximab monotherapy publish follow decade , report response rate range 25 % 80 % .</brief_summary>
