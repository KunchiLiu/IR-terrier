	<detailed_description>Objective To evaluate impact intradialytic physical training program level disability physical performance patient subject hemodialysis . Materials method 18 patient subject hemodialysis , whose age range 54 84 ( 10 woman ) include study . Nine patient participate combined training program , last 12 week , train session carry within dialysis session , work session involve warm-up period , aerobic exercise pedal , strength exercise base free-weight depend training stage . The Borg scale heart rate reserve use control train intensity . The disability level evaluate begin end study World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II , six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , quadriceps strength , Kt/V , serum level potassium creatinine . Outcomes One subject belong experimental group complete training due problem venous access 1st month training . 8 patient experimental group show significant improvement 6MWT , quadriceps strength decrease level disability . No change observe control group . No significant change find serum level potassium creatine . Conclusions An Intradialytic physical training program achieve substantial decrease level disability , improvement aerobic capacity muscle strength . The study fund extension office Austral University Chile .</detailed_description>
