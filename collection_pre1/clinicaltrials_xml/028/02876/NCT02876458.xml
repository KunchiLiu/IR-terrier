	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) remain major public health issue low survival rate . The common cause SCD acute coronary artery occlusion . Several registry base study suggest coronary angiography ( CA ) perform admission follow necessary coronary angioplasty improves in-hospital long term survival . Recent guideline recommend perform immediate CA survivor SCD obvious non cardiac cause arrest . However lack randomize data topic . Several retrospective study show post-resuscitation electrocardiogram ( ECG ) show ST segment elevation , probability find acute coronary artery lesion CA high ( 70-80 % ) . In contrast , ST segment elevation present probability low ( 15-20 % ) . Performing immediate CA survivor SCD challenge . It require admit patient center intensive care unit facility allow 24/24 7/7 CA . It may increase delay perform therapeutic modality CT brain thorax scan determine cause SCD . Performing CA 48 72 hour admission would facilitate management difficult patient . However cause arrest coronary artery occlusion delay reperfusion , rate post-arrest shock mortality may increase . Therefore randomize study compare immediate versus delay ( 48 72 hour ) CA survivor SCD obvious non-cardiac cause arrest warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design consist multicenter national randomize open parallel group trial . All eligible patient SCD include randomized Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) one 2 follow arm : immediate CA v delay CA . Patients randomize immediate CA group admit directly catheterization laboratory . Patients randomize delay CA admit intensive care unit CA plan 48 72 hour admission . Investigators perform CA delay group &lt; 48 hour follow event appear : - ST segment elevation new leave bundle branch block ECG - Shock unresponsive inotropes - `` Electrical storm '' ( repeat Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT ) /Ventricular Fibrillation ( VF ) ) - Segmental hypokinesia akinesia echocardiogram Echocardiography assessment neurological status do discharge form Intensive Care Unit , hospital discharge follow-up visit ( 90 180 day ) .</detailed_description>
