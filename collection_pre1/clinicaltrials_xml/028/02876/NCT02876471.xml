	<brief_summary>Emerging evidence suggest causal link obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) hypertension . Patient syndrome exhibit several characteristic : high prevalence , frequent non-dipper status , diastolic nocturnal predominance , related clinical subclinical organ damage heart brain . However , influence OSA nocturnal hypertension development yet clarify . Blood pressure variability ( BPV ) play role vascular damage , independent blood pressure . Apnea overload autonomic cardiovascular control system may influence BPV , classify different time interval , include beat-to-beat , hour-to-hour day-to-night change long-term , example day , week , month , season , even year . All BPV abnormality associate increased incidence cardiovascular event mortality . The investigator pre-experiment estimate BPV ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) , unable capture BP fluctuation accurately apnea event . The small study exam beat-to-beat BP OSA，and investigator ca n't couple event blood fluctuation , also incapable calculate correlation . This study aim use pulse transmit time ( PTT ) base blood pressure measurement useful continuous monitoring blood pressure monitor nocturnal beat-to-beat blood pressure fluctuation OSA without hypertension , investigate degree relevance hypoxia , AHI , nocturnal hypertension development BPV . Besides investigator also evaluate effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) blood pressure nocturnal beat-to-beat BPV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : Between March 2016 December 2016 , investigator initially recruit 450 individual report severe habitual snoring . Primal evaluation include office blood pressure , Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score ( ESS ) , antihypertensive medicine demographic anthropometric data . Then overnight polysomnography perform . Of them,100 severe OSA ( AHI &gt; 30 episode/h ) hypertension , agree stop take antihypertensive medicine . The investigator calculate time stop base half-life patient take oral drug last time administration time . The subject withdrawal time le three day enrol study . These patient hospitalize close monitoring blood pressure , blood pressure three time great 180/110mmHg appear dizziness , headache clinical syndrome , investigator give timely clinical intervention get rid study . The control group consist 100 subject severe OSA whose blood pressure normal . The investigator record nocturnal blood pressure , oximetry , beat-to-beat BPV , AHI , BP event calculate . Screening 40 newly diagnose patient hypertension subject poor blood pressure control , investigator would give one-night continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) compare AHI , mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure , number blood event short-term CPAP therapy , compare AHI , mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure , number blood event short-term CPAP therapy .</detailed_description>
