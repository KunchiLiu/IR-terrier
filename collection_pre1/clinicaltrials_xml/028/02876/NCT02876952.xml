Methods/Design : One hundred fifty people suffer acute MI perform different assessment evaluate clinical history , physical , biochemical nutritional condition , quality life 16-week follow-up . All participant receive Mediterranean diet recommendation randomly assign attention control group ( diet physical activity recommendation ) exercise group ( diet recommendation plus high-intensity aerobic interval exercise ) . Participants assign exercise group train 2 days/week supervision ( day 1-treadmill day 2-bike protocol ) . There two aerobic exercise group : 1 ) high-intensity interval training high-volume ( HV-HIIT ) group , 2 ) high-intensity interval training low-volume ( LV-HIIT ) group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Aerobic Interval Training With Mediterranean Diet Recommendations Post-Myocardial Infarct Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) continue undergo major change , remain major cause death disability worldwide . Myocardial infarction may first manifestation coronary artery disease may occur , repeatedly , patient establish disease . The term `` myocardial infarction '' may major psychological legal implication individual society . It indicator one lead health problem world outcome measure clinical trial . Coronary heart disease chronic condition patient high risk new event premature death . Several evidence-based intervention improve prognosis . Lifestyle change explain proposed patient discharge , include cessation smoking , blood pressure control , advice regard diet weight control , encouragement physical activity . Exercise therapy long used rehabilitation purpose benefit regular physical exercise also well establish . 1 The intensity aerobic exercise training key issue cardiac rehabilitation programme . Exercise intensity directly link amount improvement exercise capacity risk adverse event exercise , intensity range aerobic train prescription design include several guideline publication regard secondary prevention cardiac rehabilitation . Aerobic fitness recognize robust indicator cardiovascular health well-established predictor total cardiovascular mortality subject without coronary heart disease . Direct measurement peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) ventilatory threshold consider gold standard reference evaluation aerobic metabolism function , consequently , aerobic exercise intensity assessment design . The increase VO2peak period exercise training depend component frequency , intensity , time volume , type modality ( FITT principle ) , constitute key achieve safe exercise training effect . Endurance aerobic training typically perform continuous train moderate to-high exercise intensity steady-state condition aerobic energetic yield . However , interval training ( i.e. , repeat bouts short-duration , high severe- severe extreme-intensity exercise , separate brief period lower-intensity ) propose effective continuous exercise improve exercise capacity . Adding , health-related adaptation low-volume high intensity interval training present . This type training characterized session involve relatively small total amount exercise high-intensity ( i.e. , â‰¤10 min ) . To knowledge , study compare HIIT different volume exercise patient suffer MI . On hand , relevance overall high-quality food pattern , rather focus single nutrient food , emerge powerful paradigm address diet assess potential cardiovascular disease preventive effect . The Mediterranean Diet , represent dietary pattern usually consume among population border Mediterranean sea , widely report model healthy eat contribution favourable health status well quality life , reduce overall mortality cardiovascular disease . Considering mention MI population : 1 ) combination Mediterranean Diet exercise seem critical great reduction mortality cardiovascular disease improve cardiovascular biomarkers , 2 ) previous study compare effect combine dietary recommendation specific people MI exercise training high intensity interval train different volume ( i.e. , high- low-volume ) .INTERFARCT study design investigate effect different 16-week aerobic INTERval exercise program Mediterranean Diet recommendation people suffer acute myocardial inFARCTion . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To assess effect different program high intensity aerobic interval train Mediterranean Diet recommendation clinical condition , cardio-respiratory fitness , biomarkers , ventricular function perception quality life myocardial infarction . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . To analyze difference study variable two high intensity aerobic interval training program ( high volumen vs low volume ) Mediterranean Diet recommendation observe effect exercise volume . 2 . To analyze whether treatment recommendation ( exercise diet ) effective secondary prevention cardiovascular disease compare supervise exercise .</detailed_description>
