	<brief_summary>Defibrotide anti-inflammatory anti-coagulatory agent approve treatment veno-occlusive disease . Although clinical use almost 30 year , exact mechanism action never fully elucidate . Thus , effect defibrotide investigate human endotoxemia model order gather information action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defibrotide Human Endotoxemia Model -- ‐ Exploratory Trial Investigating Effects Mechanisms Defibrotide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Defibrotide ( DF ) highly complex polydisperse mixture single-stranded phosphodiester oligodeoxyribonucleotides derive controlled depolymerization porcine intestinal mucosal DNA . The entire mode action remain unknown . Its action may summarize pro-fibrinolytic , anti-inflammatory anti-coagulatory action . To good define mechanisms Defibrotide effect substance investigate well-established endotoxemia model . Sixteen healthy volunteer randomize receive LPS±defibrotide/placebo four subject randomize receive Placebo± defibrotide/placebo single center , randomize , double blind , placebo control , two-way crossover trial . Immediately 2h infusion 6,25mg/kg bodyweight defibrotide placebo LPS bolus 2ng/kg bodyweight infuse . Analyses perform blood sample pre-defined time-points .</detailed_description>
