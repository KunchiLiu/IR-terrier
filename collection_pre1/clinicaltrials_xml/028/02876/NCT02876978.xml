	<brief_title>Anti-GPC3 CAR T Recurrent Refractory Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center , open-label pilot study determine safety , tolerance engraftment potential CAR-GPC3 T cell subject GPC3+ positive lung squamous cell carcinoma . Primary objective : Observe determine safety tolerance escalate dose infusion CAR-GPC3 T cell ( CAR T cell target GPC3 ) transduce lentiviral vector , survival CAT-GPC3 T cell vivo , refer engraftment potential . Secondary objective : The follow index monitor curative effect CAR-GPC3 T cell lung squamous cell carcinoma : 1 . Objective response rate ( ORR ) , define ratio patient diagnose partial remission ( PR ) complete remission ( CR ) accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . 2 . Progression free survival ( PFS ) , define duration baseline PD ( audit confirm independent imaging ) , day death event . The early one shall prevail . 3 . Time tumor progression ( TTP ) , define duration baseline disease start get bad spread part body . 4 . Overall survival ( OS ) , defined time period 1st day treatment day death reason . For patient still alive data analysis day , OS data subject last confirmed time survival patient .</detailed_description>
