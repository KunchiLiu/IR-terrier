	<brief_summary>The postnatal diagnosis Long QT Syndrome ( LQTS ) suggest prolonged QT interval 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , strengthen positive family history and/or characteristic arrhythmia confirm genetic testing . However , several reason LQTS test perform successfully birth . First , fetal ECG possible direct measure fetal QT interval magnetocardiography limit few 10 site world-wide . Second , genetic testing perform utero , risk pregnancy fetus . Third , although fetus present arrhythmia easily recognize LQTS ( torsade de pointes ( TdP ) and/or 2Â° atrioventricular ( AV ) block , uncommon , occur &lt; 25 % fetal LQTS case . Rather , common presentation fetal LQTS sinus bradycardia , subtle rhythm disturbance often unappreciated abnormal . Consequently , majority LQTS case unsuspected undiagnosed fetal life , dire consequence . For example , maternal medication commonly use pregnancy prolong fetal QT interval may provoke lethal fetal ventricular arrhythmia . But significant consequence miss opportunity primary prevention life threaten ventricular arrhythmia birth infant suspect LQTS birth . The over-arching goal study overcome barrier prenatal detection LQTS . The investigator plan develop algorithm use fetal heart rate ( FHR ) discriminate fetus without LQTS . Immediate Goal : The investigator propose multicenter pre-birth observational cohort study develop Fetal Heart Rate ( FHR ) /Gestational Age ( GA ) algorithm cohort fetus recruit 13 national international center one parent know prior genetic test mutation one common LQTS gene : potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 ( KCNQ1 ) , potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 ( KCNH2 ) , sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 ( SCN5A ) . The investigator choose population 1 ) These mutation common genetic cause LQTS , 2 ) Offspring high risk LQTS inheritance LQTS gene mutation autosomal dominant . Thus , progeny parent know mutation high ( 50 % ) risk parental LQTS mutation . The algorithm develop use FHR measure serially throughout pregnancy . All offspring undergo postnatal genetic test parental mutation gold standard diagnose presence absence LQTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ascertainment LQTS , inherit arrhythmia disorder group condition know channelopathies , challenge birth . Recently , retrospective study report gestational age dependent bradycardia allow much high recognition genotype positive LQTS standard obstetrical gestational age independent definition bradycardia ( Mitchell 2012 ) . However , fetal heart rate pregnancy maternal paternal LQTS diagnose prior pregnancy evaluate prospectively first trimester birth . Nor known fetal heart rate /gestational age profile might mutation specific . In addition , use fetal heart rate successfully distinguish LQTS normal fetus pregnancy parent know mutation test . The investigator believe fetuses LQTS mutation bear family mother father LQTS mutation slow heart compare fetus , show birth family mutation . If investigator hypothesis correct , finding could apply general population pregnant woman prospectively identify fetus LQTS without know family history . Since fetal proband lead identification unsuspecting family member , prospectively identify affected fetus would increase ascertainment life-threatening mutation age ( Cuneo 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
