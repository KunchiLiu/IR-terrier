	<brief_summary>Many old adult get enough zinc , vitamin C vitamin D , relate decreased ability fight infection . The purpose research study determine take multivitamin/mineral supplement every day 12 week increase ability immune cell blood kill bacteria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Combinatorial Nutritional Supplementation Immune Function Healthy Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamins C D mineral zinc consider immune modulating micronutrient , specific effect immune system , especially use combination , relatively unknown . Deficiency micronutrient frequently observe age adult may contribute age-related decline immune status . Based prior publish study , investigator hypothesize supplementation old adult combination vitamin C , vitamin D , zinc increase innate ability neutrophil kill invade bacteria variety mechanism , include increase phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptide expression change reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) production . Therefore , study design investigate effect Redoxon VI , supplement consist combination vitamin C , vitamin D , zinc functional marker immune system healthy , old adult compare match placebo . To accomplish , investigator recruit 40 healthy adult age 60 75 randomize either Redoxon VI identical , inactive placebo control supplement take twice day 12 week . Since neutrophil-mediated kill crucial defense Staphylococcus aureus infection decline age , serve primary outcome study . Using blood collect individual supplementation , investigator measure ability neutrophil clear S. aureus cell , compare kill activity individual receive vitamin mineral supplement receive placebo . The investigator confirm change immune cell function also measure phagocytic activity neutrophil , well ability produce ROS . As secondary measure immune function , investigator also determine circulate level neutrophil , monocyte lymphocyte , measure cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide ( also know hCAP18/LL-37 ) level , determine change circulate level inflammatory cytokine . Based previous study , investigator expect increase functional immune status correspond change vitamins C , D zinc status individual . The investigator expect result study provide foundation future study investigate combination supplement immune function extensive study use micronutrient restore decline immune function observe old adult .</detailed_description>
