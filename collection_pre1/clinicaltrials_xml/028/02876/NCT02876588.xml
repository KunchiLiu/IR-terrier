	<brief_summary>Currently , least 70,000 U.S. physician use computerized provider order entry ( CPOE ) place order . This number expect rise sharply hospital continue take advantage federal incentive adopt electronic health record ( EHR ) technology . Although CPOE associate reduction medical error , order place electronically certain type error , include place order wrong patient , may occur frequently . The mechanism multiple patient record open simultaneously lead wrong-patient error may relate ease user toggle patient record similar look computer screen . The magnitude risk need establish help Health Information Technology ( IT ) leadership decide safely implement CPOE system . There study demonstrate whether multiple record increase risk wrong-patient error , much , increase dependent number record open . This research project important first step quantify risk.This first study achieve follow aim : 1 . Assess relationship number record open time place order risk place order wrong patient . 2 . Compare incidence wrong-patient order `` restrict environment '' limit provider one record open time `` unrestricted environment '' user open maximum four record . 3 . Use result inform larger-scale health IT implementation research project evaluate balance wrong-patient error risk potential efficiency gain multiple record open , rigorous research methodology . 4 . Disseminate result help inform decision safely implement EHR system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In randomize controlled trial conduct Montefiore Medical Center , investigator propose randomize inpatient outpatient provider maximum one record open time order ( restrict mode ) maximum four record open time order ( unrestricted mode ) . Assignments make prior start study , remain constant throughout study . A computer programmer work IT , investigator study , use Microsoft Excel generate random number assign one number provider . Providers assign odd number restrict cohort , assign even number unrestricted cohort . Providers join Montefiore start study assign random number Excel assign new user log electronic health record ( EHR ) computer programmer affiliate study , add appropriate group base assign random number . At start randomize controlled trial , investigator explain purpose study clinical staff via email directly within IT system , use message craft study team . The message assure clinicians data keep confidential cooperation carry risk . Montefiore use EPIC EHR system . EPIC implement Retract-and-Reorder ( RAR ) tool , automate method identify wrong-patient electronic order , well capture number record open time place order . This study examine effect EHR system restrict mode vs. unrestricted mode RAR event . The goal obtain estimate effect size intra-class correlation provide preliminary data larger-scale health IT implementation research project . The unit analysis order . First , RAR event rate order place restrict vs. unrestricted mode calculate , test difference rate use rank sum test . Next , relationship RAR event rate restrict vs. unrestricted mode subset provider setting examine determine whether specific type provider setting carry increase risk . Finally , mixed-effects logistic regression model fit RAR event outcome mode EHR system ( restrict vs. unrestricted ) independent variable interest . The model include random effect provider order-session level previous work suggest substantial within-provider within-session correlation . Orders nest session session nest provider . To address threat confounding , model include fixed-effects variable include provider , patient , order-session , order level covariates . To safeguard possibility intervention actually worsen ( increase ) RAR event rate , prevent unnecessary continuation study already conclusive , data safety monitoring committee conduct one interim review data randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
