	<detailed_description>1 . Intro Pain recently define distress experience associate actual potential tissue damage sensory , cognitive , emotional , social component . Pain see perceptual marker within physical exercise . Individuals report number perceptual marker change exertive pain show distinct source information report PE cycle instance . The perceptual marker pain still little investigated within exercise setting . From another side , best understand exertive pain , one need consider several dimension pain include sensory-discriminative , affective-motivational , cognitive-evaluative dimension . Several number study within exercise science focus sensory-discriminative dimension pain . Results suggest linear relationship pain perception power output diverse effort setting include cycling , static dynamic handgrip squeezing , incremental treadmill run . Indeed , comparison ratio leg pain arm pain cycling run also demonstrate ratio leg arm pain increase across high intensity . Most extant work however centre pain PE group-based standpoint lead group-based conclusion . Traditionally , within exercise science , variable measure distinct , low-frequency time point , either average course trial report measured time . In turn , practice make difficult measure dynamic feed-forward feedback control mechanism inherent variable . Taken together , study pain discomfort individual , case-by-case standpoint , high-frequency time point set , may present unique benefit . Considering physiological psychological variable ( e.g. , PE ) present fluctuation heavy constant-power cycle report measurement frequency 15 seem plausible assume pain location also fluctuate . Consequently , may useful distinguish amongst differential type spatiotemporal pain fluctuation pattern exercise . Mapping dynamic help predict individual-specific fatigue course exercise . The functional role fluctuate dynamic already study psychological ( e.g. , volitional state , think process ) kinematic variable constant-power exercise perform volitional exhaustion . These approach important suppression intra- individual variability perform statistical averaging may hide property individual system . In vein , tend study delineate individualize pain discomfort pattern exercise . The purpose study study individual spatiotemporal structure dynamic topologically define area perceive body discomfort pain exercise . 2 . Methods 2.1 Participants To determine sample size study power analysis conduct use G*Power 3.1 . In study think process large effect size report . Thus , use effect size = 1.0 , α &lt; 0.05 , power ( 1 - β ) = 0.80 , sample size n = 11 emerge . Caucasian physical education student ( age range : 18 - 30 year ) undergo regular aerobic exercise recruit participate voluntarily study . Students receive oral write information regard study . They additionally encourage ask question would still ambiguities . 2.2 Materials procedure Completion study take total three session , separate one-week interval , approximately 30 minute . At week one , participants complete baseline incremental cycling run test determine workload velocity value correspond RPE ( 6-20 Borg 's scale ) = 15 ( i.e. , heavy ) . At time , participant also familiarize use body map report procedure . At week two three , participant complete constant-power cycling constant velocity run task , respectively , counter-balanced assigned order . 2.2.1 . Monitoring Discomfort Pain Every 15 exercise , upon researcher 's prompt , participant report bodily location discomfort pain body map scale . 2.2.2 . Constant-power Cycling Task The task include incremental warm-up session constant-power cycling perform volitional exhaustion . The constant-power cycling begin participant report RPE = 15 incremental warm-up cycling task last volitional exhaustion . The end set participant wo n't able cycle longer fix cadence five consecutive second sit position . 2.2.3 . Constant-velocity Running Task The task include incremental warm-up ( identical running baseline test ) constant velocity run perform volitional exhaustion . The constant velocity run start participant achieve report RPE = 15 incremental warm-up last volitional exhaustion could longer able maintain impose velocity . 2.2.4 . Commitment check Upon completion test procedure participant answer question complete commitment measure commitment level report task ( ) commitment task ( b ) , 11-point Likert-type scale anchor range 0 ( ) 10 ( greatly ) . 2.3 Data collection analysis All location participant transform binary vector . Investigators analyse effect time step use repeated measure ANOVAs . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) use reduce dimensionality local discomfort and/or pain data ( obtain 50-item pain map ) . The data time test session report list . All data reconstruct participant .</detailed_description>
