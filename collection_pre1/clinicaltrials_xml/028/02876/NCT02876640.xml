	<brief_title>Retinoid 9cUAB30 Producing Biologic Effect Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare molecular analysis pre- post-treatment tissue sample breast cancer patient treat 14-28 day oral retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) -selective retinoid 9cUAB30 ( 9 c-UAB30 ) demonstrate significantly reduce proliferation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 14-28 day oral RXR-selective 9c-UAB30 treatment increase apoptotic index , measure TUNEL assay . II . Examine difference gene expression baseline post-exposure breast cancer sample use custom gene panel Nanostring Technologies . OUTLINE : Patients receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 14 28 day . Patients undergo tumor resection surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 7 day 4-5 week .</detailed_description>
