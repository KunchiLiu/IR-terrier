	<brief_title>A Comparision Collagen Matrix Connective Tissue Graft With Modified Coronally Advanced Tunnel Root Coverage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gingival recession define displacement soft tissue margin apical cementoenamel junction may affect single multiple root surface . Gingival recession know compromise esthetic appearance , hind plaque control , result high susceptibility hypersensitivity root caries . It result different predispose anatomic feature thin gingival biotype , buccal prominence teeth , lack keratinize tissue , high frenal attachment , patient related factor vigorous brush chronic gingival inflammation . Recessions may localize generalize . Alternatively classify four class basis extent . Miller 's Class I Class II recession defect mainly occur multiple buccal area main etiologic factor include trauma tooth brushing . Miller 's Class III Class IV recession usually involve whole mouth often related plaque associate chronic inflammatory periodontal disease . Because traumatic etiology , multiple recession frequent . It extensively demonstrate Miller 's Class I II single recession , complete root coverage predictably achieve various technique . On hand , treatment multiple adjacent gingival recession still challenge clinician case management soft tissue become difficult wound heal may compromise various factor width avascular surface , limited blood supply , difference recession depth position teeth . The ultimate goal root coverage procedures complete coverage recession defect , good esthetic harmonious integration cover tissue minimal probe depths treatment . A variety surgical procedure use cover exposed root surface Laterally Positioned Flap , Coronally Advanced Flap , Modified Coronally Advanced Flap , Coronally Advanced Tunnel , Modified Coronally Advanced Tunnel , Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft ( SCTG ) , Acellular Dermal Matrix ( ADMA ) Guided Tissue Regeneration . Coronally advance flap ( CAF ) SCTG predictable technique , achieve 100 % root coverage . CAF alone various modification use widely successfully . Studies state SCTG high percentage mean root coverage also least variability . In spite promising result , SCTG limitation , lack graft availability , need second surgical site , proximity palatine neurovascular complex unesthetic contour recipient site . In case , harvest connective tissue may difficult presence flat palatal profile thickness masticatory mucosa appear thin . The additional chair time must also consider compare need perform CAF alone . But note various study CAF alone effective CAF CTG , lead attempt find alternative CTG benefit none drawback . Variants membrane , biologic modifier , allograft develop test substitute CTG . Collagen matrix ( CM ) , compose non-crosslinked porcine collagen , one substitute . The matrix intend support 3D soft tissue regeneration favour blood clot stabilization early vascularization excellent tissue integration . It consist superficial cell occlusive layer , deeper porous layer . The primary importance CM lie function almost well CTG procedure root coverage perform increase dimension keratinize gingiva , time avoid negative latter . The additional advantage CM influence heal cascade reduce scar retraction . Also lead increased thickness keratinize gingiva thus remedy one etiolgical factor gingival recession . The advent material could revolutionary impact within field periodontics . But merit research study direction clarify position collagen matrix substitute CTG periodontal plastic surgery . Therefore need study evaluate efficacy collagen matrix definitive alternative CTG able supplant CTG effective method treat gingival recession . Tunnel technique perioplastic surgery first introduce Allen 1994 , follow modification Zabalegui ( 1999 ) , Modified Coronally Advanced Tunnel ( MCAT ) , Microsurgical CAT . All technique show remarkable success root coverage . MCAT technique certain advantage CAF/ Modified CAF vascular supply coronally advanced component compromise due avoidance vertical/ horizontal incision . Recently porcine derive bioresorbable collagen matrix show predictable outcome augment keratinzed gingiva , improve wound healing , recession coverage localize gingival recession multiple recession coverage . However randomize control clinical trial literature compare collagen matrix versus CTG management MRTDs . To best knowledge one RCT compare MCAT+CTG MCAT+CM management multiple gingival recession . Thus aim study compare effectiveness collagen versus CTG management Millers class I II multiple gingival recession . The use collagen matrix combination Modified Coronally Advanced Tunnel surgical technique compare recession coverage .</detailed_description>
