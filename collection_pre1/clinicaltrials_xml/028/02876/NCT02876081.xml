	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death France , Europe world . 50 % lung cancer adenocarcinoma subtype . 60 % patient present metastatic disease ( stage IV ) time diagnosis . Approximately 10 % patient present mutation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) require EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) , namely erlotinib , gefitinib afatinib . For majority chemotherapy-naïve patient without addictive mutation , platinum-based chemotherapy , frequently platinum - pemetrexed doublet , provide disease control rate 70 % improve survival approximately 4.5 best supportive care alone 15 month . However , patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) usually relapse within 4 6 month benefit second-line chemotherapy . Authorized drug set pemetrexed , docetaxel erlotinib . The prescription erlotinib unselected patient whose tumor harbor EGFR mutation questionable . In second line setting , docetaxel provide less 10 % partial responses progression-free survival 10 12 week . There standard option follow failure two previous line standard chemotherapy . In view modest result , new agent therapeutic strategy greatly need patient population . Neurotensin ( NTS ) 13 amino acid peptide , present biologically active central nervous system periphery . At peripheral level , NTS release endocrine cell intestinal mucosa meal act endocrine hormone involve postprandial regulation motor function gastrointestinal tract . The effect NTS mediate three subtypes receptor : NTSR1 NTSR2 exhibit high low affinity NTS , respectively , belong family G protein receptor ; NTSR3 single transmembrane domain receptor . Exogenous activation NTSR1 lead cell proliferation , survival , mobility invasion cancer cell diverse origin . These effect result activation kinase effector , PKC , MAPK , FAK , RHO-GTPase , RAS Src . The PKC activation may induce MAPK direct stimulation Raf-1 , transactivation EGFR . The activation MAPK via NTSR1 mainly associate uncontrolled cell growth . Both NTS NTSR1 express 40 % lung tumor , whereas never express normal tissue . NTSR1 high expression negative prognostic factor stage I III operate lung adenocarcinoma . Sustained stimulation NTSR1 result activation MMP1 , release EGF `` like '' ligands HB-EGF well neuregulin 1 NGR1 ( specific ligand HER3 ) follow EGFR , HER2 HER3 overexpression activation . Accordingly , xenografted tumor express NTS NTSR1 show positive response erlotinib , whereas tumor void NTSR1 expression detectable response . Afatinib ( BIBW2992 ) small molecule , selective irreversible erbB family blocker . In preclinical model effectively inhibit EGFR , HER2 HER4 phosphorylation result tumour growth inhibition regression establish subcutaneous tumour derive four human cell-lines know co-express ErbB receptor . Our claim patient harbour NTS/NTSR complex , without EGFR mutation , respond afatinib due sustain activation EGFR/HER2 neurotensin activation . Presently , EGFR mutate tumor eligible receive EGFR TKI represent 10 % lung cancer patient . The aim study evaluate efficacy afatinib , EGFR TKI , lung adenocarcinoma , EGFR wild-type , bear NTS/NTSR1 complex high level expression . This subpopulation patient represent approximately 20 % lung adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
