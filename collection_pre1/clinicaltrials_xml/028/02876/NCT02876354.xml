	<brief_title>Risk Factors Vascular Calcifications Hemodialysis Patients : What Extent Vitamin K2 Deficiency Involved ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The majority patient reach end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) dialysis vascular calcification . Those vascular calcification tend increase mortality specific population . It show high score vascular calcification healthy patient cardiovascular risk factor lead high mortality rate compare someone ≥3 risk factor without calcification . In hemodialysis ( HD ) patient , cardiovascular risk factor numerous include traditional one age , smoking , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia specific chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) instance hyperparathyroidism . All fact compel argument look seriously treatment vascular calcification . Therefore 2009 Kidney disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) Clinical Practice Guideline Diagnosis , Evaluation , Prevention , Treatment Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disorder ( CKD-MBD ) suggest measure vascular calcification score lateral abdominal radiograph cost-effective alternative standard compute tomography-based imaging . In order lower prevent vascular calcification chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient , many intervention study past . They include treatment statin , non-calcium-based phosphate binder cinacalcet . So far , non-calcium-based phosphate binder show significant benefit mortality none study manifest solid beneficial effect vascular calcification . In last year , remarkable data emerge concern association vascular calcification plasmatic level dephosphorylated-undercarboxylated MGP ( dp-ucMGP ) . dp-ucMGP inactive form Matrix gla protein ( MGP ) . MGP small protein know act locally tissue calcification inhibitor vitamin K dependent . High dp-ucMGP level reflect low activity MGP . Vitamin K2 deficiency one factor increase dp-ucMGP . There several report also show dp-ucMGP level increase gradually age 40 significantly high old 65 , patient diabetes , aortic stenosis , heart failure vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) . They also extremely high ESRD patient dialysis . Moreover combination VKA dialysis increase incidence calciphylaxis . Since high dp-ucMGP level suggest vitamin k2 deficiency associate vascular calcification , supplement high-risk patient especially CKD patient vitamin k2 ( menaquinone ) seem promising . Vitamin k2 provide patient pill specific food diet . Food seem affect dp-ucMGP level include natto ferment cheese camembert , goat cheese gouda . Vitamin K2 supplementation analyze several European HD cohort . In 2012 , Westenfeld et al . demonstrate vitamin k2 supplement hemodialysis patient lead dose-dependent decrease plasma dp-ucMGP level . This reproduce Caluwé al 2014 show dose 360 μg /d low dp-ucMGP 30-33 % . Studies patient normal renal function show high decrease dp-ucMGP ~50 % 180 μg /d menaquinone could explain many way . Either vitamin K2 deficiency profound CKD particularly dialysis patient dp-ucMGP reflect vitamin k2 deficiency patient . High dp-ucMGP could associate risk factor calcification chronic kidney disease phosphate , calcium parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . Middle-Eastern diet different European country MGP activity well vitamin K2 supplementation yet study dialysis population part world . Therefore study conduct Lebanese hemodialysis center patient receive vitamin k2 4 week . The investigator ass first rate decrease dp-ucMGP supplementation vitamin K2 correlation rate decrease AC24 score . They analyze well factor associate high level dp-ucMGP . Finally define rate decrease dp-ucMGP VKA withdrawal small subgroup include study . Methods design Trial design , participant data collection This prospective , pre-post intervention clinical trial . All patient single dialysis center old 18 year chronic hemodialysis since one month include . Patients take VKA stop ( heart valve replacement case ) exclude . The total expected trial duration 4 week . Data demographic , comorbidities , medication laboratory result collect patient ' medical record . Variables study : age , gender , month dialysis , residual diuresis , BMI , urea reduction ratio ( URR ) , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , hyperlipidemia , calcium non-calcium-based phosphate binder , cinacalcet , alfacalcidol , AC-24 score , dp-ucMGP level , albumin , coronary artery disease , mean calcium , phosphorus parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . Calcium , phosphorus , PTH , LDL cholesterol serum albumin level collect medical record patient . Calcium phosphorus measure monthly routine basis ; mean last 12 measurement calculate . PTH measure every 4-6 month ; PTH level patient collect since start dialysis order obtain mean PTH level . Definitions Coronary artery disease define history coronary artery disease treat medically interventionally . Diabetes hypertension define take antidiabetic treatment antihypertensive treatment respectively . Normal phosphate calcium define respectively 3.5-4.5 mg/dL 8.4-9.5 mg/dL . Non-calcium phosphate binder available sevelamer lanthanum . The active vitamin D patient take alfacalcidol . Ethical consideration The study approve ethical committee Saint-Joseph University-Beirut complies Declaration Helsinki 1975 . All patient give write informed consent participate . The supplementation vitamin K2 put patient risk hypercoagulability previous prospective cohort 35000 healthy subject supplement vitamin K show increase ischemic stroke event . Intervention : Patients eligible trial sign inform consent . All patient receive 360 μg menaquinone daily . Menaquinone provide Omicron , Lebanon . The chosen dose trial establish two previous trial do hemodialysis patient . A daily dose 360 μg Menaquinone reduce amount inactive MGP 30-33 % hemodialysis patient . The dose day dialysis give center ensure least compliance towards half dose per week . Before start trial , patient vitamin k antagonist prevention vascular access thrombosis withdraw VKA include study stabilization dp-ucMGP level . The investigator assess average time necessary reach stable level dp-ucMGP VKA withdrawal . Patients assign receive 360 μg menaquinone daily . Analysis dp-ucMGP AC-24 score measurement dp-ucMGP measured twice , vitamin k2 supplementation second four week treatment . Pre-dialysis venous blood sample process laboratory . Circulating dp-ucMGP quantified use dual antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay provide Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd , United Kingdom . Lateral abdominal X-ray lumbar aorta perform inclusion study . For patient abdominal aortic calcification estimate use Aortic Calcification Severity ( AC-24 ) score . The AC-24 score calculate two independent physician . If difference one point , high score record . If difference one point third opinion seek mean three level retain . Clinical data Follow-up Patients pre-dialysis blood pressure measure 15 min rest record begin end study use validate automated electronic monitor . Their blood pressure level check also 4 week period three time per week dialysis center . Assessment adverse event Patients evaluate side-effect dialysis session , especially regard vascular access patency thrombotic event . Statistical analysis Descriptive statistic use represent important variable know risk factor , exposure treatment option . Continuous variable normally distribute present mean standard deviation . Otherwise median range appropriate method . Student test one way ANOVA use parametric variable comparison Mann Whitney U Kruskal Wallis non parametric variable . Categorical variable present count percentage . Χ2 fischer exact test logistic regression use compare two categorical variable respectively . Pearson correlation calculate investigate association vascular calcification score dp-ucMGP level well potential covariates . A stepwise multivariable linear regression employ adjust association MGP calcification score presence significant covariates . P &lt; 0.20 consider valid inclusion model . A 2-sided P &lt; 0.05 consider significant . To determine effect vitamin K2 intake dp-ucMGP , pre- post-levels compare use match t-test . All analyse do use SPSS statistic ( 22.0 version , SPSS Inc , Chicago , III ) .</detailed_description>
