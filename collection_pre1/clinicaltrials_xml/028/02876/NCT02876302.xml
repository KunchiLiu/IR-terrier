	<brief_summary>This research study study Ruxolitinib possible treatment Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( IBC ) . The Following drug use combination Ruxolinitinib . - Paclitaxel ( also call Taxol ) - Doxorubicin also call Adriamycin - Cyclophosphamide , also call Cytoxan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Ruxolitinib ( INCB018424 ) With Preoperative Chemotherapy For Triple Negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Ruxolitinib Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( IBC ) , approve us . Ruxolitinib newly discover drug show block pathway ( call IL6/JAK/Stat pathway ) may important cancer , include triple negative inflammatory breast cancer . Ruxolitinib bring protein group together , result gene ( DNA ) change . These DNA change may stop cancer cell grow . Paclitaxel ( also call Taxol ) , Doxorubicin Cyclophosphamide ( also call Adriamycin Cytoxan , ( `` AC '' ) ) drug FDA approve breast cancer patient . They show result death cancer cell give preoperative treatment woman inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) . Laboratory study show Ruxolitinib may make Paclitaxel effective . In research study , investigator evaluate Ruxolitinib combination Paclitaxel follow standard chemotherapy , AC . Researchers also evaluate IL6/JAK/Stat pathway affect combination drug study biopsy surgical specimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer . All histologic subtypes eligible . Patients must know ER , PR , HER2 status define triplenegative breast cancer ( TNBC ) , define : ER PR &lt; 10 % immunohistochemistry , HER2negative ( define IHC 0 1+ , FISH ratio &lt; 2.0 ) . Patients must clinical diagnosis inflammatory breast cancer evidence onset sign symptom note within 6 month timeperiod : Erythema breast Edema skin breast Enlargement breast Age ≥ 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ruxolitinib participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine 01.3 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal Patients must without evidence visceral bone involvement metastatic cancer physical exam diagnostic study . Extensive nodal involvement allow . Both men woman allow . The effect ruxolitinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry completion chemotherapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . LVEF &gt; 50 % calculate echocardiogram ( ECHO ) MUGA Patients may bilateral breast cancer long one breast meet criteria inflammatory breast cancer , neither breast cancer receive prior therapy Participants may receive investigational agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients evidence metastatic disease involvement viscera bone . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ruxolitinib . Participants receive medication substance potent inhibitor CYP3A4 , include grapefruit juice ineligible . Participants receive fluconazole also ineligible . ( Please refer Appendix B full list potent inhibitor washout period ) . Chronic corticosteroid use excess equivalent prednisone 10 mg daily . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Known HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy eligible long meet criterion . Known HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy eligible individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome . Patients may receive paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide antineoplastic therapy .</criteria>
