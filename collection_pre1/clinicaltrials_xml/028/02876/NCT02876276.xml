	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Periodontal disease , trauma , treatment periodontal diseases iatrogenic cause lead papillary tissue loss interproximal area.1 Management soft tissue deformity interproximal space advocate several surgical non-surgical technique . The non-surgical approach - orthodontic , prosthetic restorative procedure modify interproximal space , thereby alter soft tissue morphology . The surgical technique aim recontour , preserve reconstruct soft tissue teeth implant . Surgical technique , due invasive unpredictable nature limit blood supply/ minimal access make regeneration deficient papilla highly sensitive procedure.2 Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) high molecular weight polysaccharide play vital role function extracellular matrix , include mineralize non-mineralized periodontal tissue . HA help tissue hydrodynamics , cell migration/ proliferation , anti-inflammatory role facilitates healing.3 HA show anti-inflammatory , anti-edematous anti-bacterial effect treatment gingivitis periodontitis.4 Deviating utility , HA also play important role non surgical facial rejuvenation bioengineered hyaluronic acid derivative . The exquisite role bioengineered hyaluronic acid derivative soft tissue augmentation gingival deficiency research enough . Based beneficial effect HA dermatology , present triple blind split mouth randomise clinical trial plan evaluate injection HA dermal filler minimally invasive treatment modality reconstruction lose interdental papilla . The aim present study evaluate efficacy hyaluronic acid dermal filler interproximal papillary augmentation Nordland 's Class I Class II5 interdental papillary recession defect . MATERIALS AND METHODS : PARTICIPANTS : 15 adult patient out-patient department Department Periodontology , Krishnadevaraya College Dental Sciences , Bangalore , India , age 25-75 year recruit among seek treatment esthetic maxillary anterior region due interdental papilla recession , July 2013 September 2014 . The detail study procedure explain patient institutional review board approve informed consent obtain patient , affiliate Rajiv Gandhi University Health Sciences ( ACA/DCD/SYN/KCODS - B/PG/2012-2013 ) ( 02_D012_36683 ) . INTERVENTIONS Papillary augmentation HA dermal filler consider test group compare saline injection ( placebo ) control group . The study conduct full accordance declare ethical principle ( World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki , version VI , 2002 ) approve Institutional review board Krishnadevaraya College Dental Science Hospital , affiliate Rajiv Gandhi University Health Sciences , Bangalore . This study conduct 2 investigator one operator , one investigator operator blind . The unblinded investigator perform randomisation allocation test control group , whereas study measurement assessment perform blinded investigator operator . The patient informed way decipher test control group . Both investigator assess follow clinical outcome . STUDY DESIGN The design study unicenter , triple blind , placebo control split mouth randomise controlled clinical trial accord Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) criterion , 2010 ( Fig 1 ) . All patient complete initial therapy include oral hygiene instruction scale root planning . 2 similar site patient i.e . total 30 interdental papillary recession area select treat . One patient fail complete follow visit hence exclude study . DATA COLLECTION Data collection include baseline clinical measurement photograph take perpendicular site baseline , 3 week , 3 month 6 month . The radiograph take use position device intraoral periapical radiograph grid baseline 6 month . Study impression sit take baseline.2 At baseline subsequent study visit mention clinical parameter record examiner use standardize acrylic stent University North Carolina ( UNC 15 ) probe , i.e . papillary recession depth ( distance contact point gingival margin measure near millimeter— CP -GM ) ; Interproximal width ( distance mesial height contour distal height contour interproximal tissue—IPW ) ; Width keratinize gingiva ( schiller 's potassium iodide solution—KTW ) ; Facial gingival recession two adjacent teeth11 ; Radiographic Analysis papilla height ( vertical distance tip interdental papilla , use radiopaque material mark tip crest alveolar bone ) 12 ; Plaque index ( PI ) 13 ; Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) 14 ; Gingival Index ( GI ) 15 photographic analysis intraoral photograph take use Image analysis software . ( Digimiser∗ ) 6 OUTCOMES : Two different treatment method compare , HA filler ( n=15 ) saline ( n=15 ) . The primary outcome assess study papillary recession reduction ( pRecRed ) . pRecRed calculate millimeter percentage papillary coverage ( PPC ) . The percentage complete papillary coverage ( CPC ) group assess . The formula use calculate percentage papillary coverage follows- Baseline ( CP-GM ) - 6 month ( CP-GM ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- x 100 Baseline ( CP-GM ) The primary outcome also assess photogrammetric analysis use Digimiser software∗ . Image analysis consist several step : image identification , image scaling , calibration , measurement . The ideal image select scaled standard ( 1:1 ) magnification . The photograph calibrate standardised actual clinical dimension feed know clinical dimension ( 1mm marking UNC-15∗∗∗periodontal probe photograph ) software . Determination distance contact point gingival margin do ( CP-GM ) .The ideal height interdental papillary recession measure distance line join apical tip papilla contact point teeth . The primary outcome measurement i.e . papillary recession depth assess use computerized software tool . The following secondary outcome also measure change interproximal width2 ; width keratinize gingiva9 ; facial gingival recession two adjacent teeth11 ; radiographic height papilla height using12 ; Plaque index13 ; Gingival Bleeding Index14 Gingival Index15 . PRE-TREATMENT PROCEDURES : Initial therapy include scale root planning complete prior treatment procedure.10 The patient demonstrate ≤ 20 % O'Leary Plaque Index subject study protocol.2 Occlusal interference identify eliminate occlusal adjustment , hard acrylic bite guard construct patient parafunctional habit . The study design extraneous factor oral hygiene compliance control within subject . RANDOMIZATION : Randomization sequence generate computer program . Allocation concealment achieve use seal coded opaque envelope contain treatment specific subject . The unblinded investigator open seal envelope contain treatment assignment Test site ( treatment HA filler ) Control Site ( treatment placebo ) prior treatment procedure allot case operator accordingly . The patient investigator operator blind treatment perform . PROCEDURE : 6 week initial therapy , patient schedule procedure.16 Local Anesthetic solution ( 2 % Lignocaine HCl adrenaline 1:80000 ) administered.17 About 0.2 ml commercially available hyaluronic acid base gel injected 2-3 mm coronal apical tip recede interdental papilla ( Fig 2 ) . Injections perform use 23 gauge X 25mm intraoral injection needle . The concentration HA gel use 20 mg/ml.6 The area gently massage ensure filler uniformly distribute . Care take fill papilla full correction ( 100 % defect ) . After treatment individual patient syrinx cap stored refrigerator patient name detail . The needle discard . Patients see three week initial treatment augmentation still deem necessary , another injection 0.2ml inject three times.6 In control site protocol perform , however saline . Patients recall clinical radiographic parameter record three month six month . SATATISTICAL ANALYSIS : A sample 14 recession group ( test control ) , include . The analysis perform blind examiner . Statistical analysis undertaken SPSS ( version10.0.5 ) package . Normality data test use Shapiro-Wilk test . The intergroup comparison do use student 't ' test chi square test , Mann Whitney U test post hoc test . Intergroup comparison different recall visit do use Mann Whitney U test . The intergroup comparison photogrammetric analysis ; mean papillary recession reduction test control baseline 6 month compare use student 't ' test Mann Whitney U test post hoc test . Intragroup comparison baseline follow visit value do use one ANOVA test Kruskal Wallis test . Comparison clinical analysis image analysis do use chi square test . DISCUSSION The attempt use dermal filler papillary augmentation scarcely report existing literature . Only one study evaluate effect HA filler interdental papilla reconstruction note injection hyaluronic acid gel safe significantly decrease interdental black triangle esthetic zone.3 Application non-invasive technique use commercially available hyaluronic acid gel replace conventional invasive method . This split mouth clinical study consist 15 patient Nordland Tarnow 's Class I Class II6 papillary loss treat either HA gel ( test ) saline ( control ) papillary augmentation . Significantly 28.6 % sit test group show CPC whereas site control group show CPC . The result agreement Becker et al . 2010 achieve 21.4 % CPC similarly injection HA gel papillary augmentation.3 CPC note Nordland et al 200818 , use microsurgical technique reconstruct lose interdental papilla , Tinti C et al . 200219 use Ramp mattress suture augment papilla , Carnio et al . 200420 - interpose subepithelial connective tissue graft Geurs et al10 show 57.9 % CPC . Various author also report CPC different techniques.21-24 55.4 % PPC achieve HA augmentation , similar 42.1 % PPC achieve Geurs et al . 201210 used micronized acellular dermal matrix allograft papillary reconstruction . Another similar study show significant papillary fill post operatively.2 No significant difference note group regard interproximal width . A similar trend note Mcguire &amp; Scheyer 2007.2 There significant change dimension keratinize gingiva group . Image analysis system measure change root coverage also successfully employ previous literature.26 Identification anatomic CEJ , accuracy determine probe pocket depth/ papillary height/ width etc . subject manual error . Calibrated photogrammetric analysis reduce subjective measurement error . The current study report significant difference clinical photogrammetric analysis . 26 Literature review reveals split mouth randomise control clinical trial duration equal 6 month assess complete papillary coverage primary outcome papillary reconstruction papillary recession defect rarely document . However , frequent reporting primary outcome variable like PPC , pRecRed , change papillary index score casual mention significant papillary gain . Due inconsistent insufficient data available regard papillary reconstruction , difficult compare result current trial . Hyaluronic acid gel§§§ generate Streptococcus specie bacteria chemically cross-linked concentration 20 mg/mL . Hyaluronic acid filler less allergy prone produce favourable results.27 Hyaluronic acid form natural physiological constituent ground substance connective tissue gingival mucosa , hence consider treatment papillary deficiency . Patients blood thin agent might experience mild bruising , therefore eliminate blood thin agent least 7 day injection preferred.28 HA act matrix , provide lubrication increase volume aqueous pliable framework suspends adhere collagen , elastin numerous protein like fibrinogen , fibrin , fibronectin collagen bind HA.29 HA integrate well adjacent gingiva excellent esthetic result . Microcirculatory perfusion enhance HA.30 The plumping interdental papilla inject defect HA filler could explain fact HA unique rheological property highly hydrophilic bind upto 1000 time water molecular-weight.31 HA injection show increase denovo collagen synthesis , hypothesize result fibroblast stretching . As HA degrade novel collagen synthesis replaces HA result longer last correction.32 CPC achieve maintain current trial attribute hydrophilpic nature collagen synthesize property HA filler . The cross link prevents degradation body . The high level cross link alters ability water bind HA thereby create tissue lift.28 HA increase cell division tubulin concentration help proliferation fibroblast cell cycle.33 HA also act biomaterial scaffold molecule , BMP-2 PDGF-BB.4 Smooth-gel dermal filler like HA offer longer-lasting correction defect bovine collagen etc . The insoluble gel portion persist skin gingiva injection amount HA contribute clinical effect.34 The product trial smooth gel HA dermal filler offer long last correction achieve natural look post injection.35 Nearly subject achieve optimal correction single injection 0.2ml HA dermal filler.6 The commonly employ injection technique dermal filler ( serial puncture , linear threading , fan cross hatch ) employ current trial owing limited area minimal access interdental papillary region . The product use current study 1.8 % sodium salt hyaluronic acid . It successfully use treatment nasolabial fold adverse events.36 Results study evaluate use commercially available injectable gel correct deficient papilla teeth successful promise minimally invasive . This study follow period 6 month compare study Becker et al . 20106 follow period 6-25 month base patient compliance . It interesting note patient consider treatment painless . Traditional gingival augmentation use epithelial/ connective tissue graft harvest palate cause considerable discomfort patient successfully avoid HA dermal filler . Randomized clinical trial longer follow time period large sample size undertaken justify use HA dermal filler augmentation papillary deficiency .</detailed_description>
