	<brief_summary>Bring element understand study brain organization bodily representation . The body organize multiple , distinct level representation . The body schema unconscious dynamic representation body , update constantly , result convergence multiple sensory information , articulate motor system participate genesis action . The self-image corresponds abstract representation body , cover symbolic imaginary aspect draw emotional life individual . Finally , body another person engage simultaneously share differential representational system allow understanding action others preserve identity agent responsible action . These various body represent subtly interact participate equilibrium , self-awareness building curious , social acting . Brain organization bodily representation remain fundamental question still poorly explored major scientific interest influence identity social construction , serious repercussion problem , also individual society . This project aim deepen hypothesis use methodology combine functional image awake surgery . The richness project lie innovative method investigation , plurality discipline ( neuropsychology , neurophysiology , neuroimaging neurosurgery ) team ( clinical research ) group wear . The subject enrol study candidate patient awaken provide surgery therapeutic reason , volunteer participate experiment . Awake neurosurgery patient glial tumor , also brain metastasis intra-parenchymal cavernomas . A first experimental session hold pre-operative period . Patients realize functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain define precise functional mapping cortical structure , include lateral occipital , involve body representation . The second experimental session conduct neurosurgical intervention , practice one four week later . This dual approach combine functional stimulation cortical area ( image ) functional inhibition ( surgery ) allow make extremely robust scientific argument causal relationship link structure function</brief_summary>
