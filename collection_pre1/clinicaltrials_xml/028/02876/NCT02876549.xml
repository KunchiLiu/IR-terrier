	<brief_summary>This single-arm observational cohort study . Malaria patient Plasmodium vivax meeting study inclusion criterion , give consent enrol study , G6PD status measure CareStartâ„¢ G6DP rapid diagnostic test ( G6PD RDT ) , primaquine prescribe accord result . According G6PD RDT result , primaquine prescribe 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day ( normal patient ) 0.75mg/kg weekly eight week ( deficient patient ) . All receive treatment chloroquine clear asexual stage infection . Patients review day 2 , day 7 day 14 . At visit patient undergo brief clinical assessment small blood sample take repeat haemoglobin measurement dry blood spot carboxyprimaquine measurement ( day 7 day 14 ) . In general , antimalarial treatment unsupervised reflect field condition . However subset 25 G6PD normal patient single site day primaquine treatment administer observed treatment centre . This determine calibration curve primaquine pharmacokinetic study . Dried blood spot store appropriately . Day zero sample genotyped Bangkok ( MORU , Dr. Mallika Imwong ) DNA extraction . PCR-RFLP use detect allele associate Mediterranean variant G6PD deficiency . In addition DNA extract send systematic genetic test know G6PD variant exist collaboration Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute . The day 7 14 dry blood spot sample analyse MORU pharmacology laboratory primaquine carboxyprimaquine concentration , adherence primaquine determine retrospectively , use subset 25 patient receive directly observe therapy calibrate result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G6PD Assessment Before Primaquine Radical Treatment Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Screening All patient register outpatient service outpatient department undergo routine investigation . When malaria suspect , thick thin blood smear obtain microscopic diagnosis Plasmodium vivax malaria RDT undertaken . After diagnosis confirm microscopically , assessment make see patient fulfils study inclusion exclusion criterion . The following clinical screening procedure perform . The age , gender , ethnic group , contact detail subject record source document . In medical history , history chronic disease include previous history haemolysis anaemia note along history allergy medication ( include chloroquine primaquine ) . Pregnancy contraindication primaquine woman consider risk pregnancy undergo urine pregnancy test prior enrolment . A pregnancy test do routinely Afghanistan , consistent National Treatment Guidelines . Vital sign ( axillary temperature degree Celsius , heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure , weight kilogram ) record . The physician perform general system examination . 2 . Consent Patients fulfil study inclusion exclusion criterion approach informed consent . 3 . Procedures enrolment Once informed consent give , second capillary blood sample ( finger prick ) take : - CareStart RDT G6PD test . The RDT read appropriate time ( 10 minute ) result note source document . The RDT label retained future reference . It also analyse host parasite genotype . - Baseline haemoglobin measurement via HemoCue system . This generally involve use micropipette HemoCue microcuvettes . - Collection dry blood spot ( FTA card ) label individual barcode . - If malaria RDT use diagnosis also label keep possible future analyse G6PD parasite genotyping . - Biosensor recording also make subset patient day 0 day 14 , device becomes available . These result influence patient management base RDT result . 4 . Antimalarials Chloroquine provide aim dose 10 mg/kg day 0 &amp; 1 5mg/kg day 2 , ( Afghanistan NMLCP guideline ) . Primaquine also provide . ( See dose table ) The target dose primaquine : - 0.25 mg/kg/day 14 day ( G6PD normal patient ) - 0.75 mg/kg weekly eight week ( G6PD deficient patient ) . For small child , accurate drug dosage ensure crush whole 15mg tablet mix 10 ml water ( sugar possible ) prior oral administration 1-4 ml via syringe ( see Table 2 ) . For old child small adult tablet split near quarter ( see Appendix dos also crush administration necessary ) . Primaquine daily dose This dose table provide daily dose 0.19 0.33 mg/kg primaquine ( total dose 14 day 2.6 - 4.7 mg/kg ) . Children offer sweet drink drug administer minimize chance vomit . Parents child show measure dose allow accurate home administration . Treatment generally unsupervised reflect field condition . Sufficient primaquine give last next visit . From investigator work others similar population , adherence population good , checked pharmacological assessment carboxyprimaquine level . A subset 25 G6PD normal patient one site primaquine treatment observe day treatment centre qualify member staff designate principal investigator . Study patient observe 60 minute drug administration vomit . Any patient vomit first half-hour observation period retreat dose drug observe additional 30 minute . If patient vomit second period receive half drug . This simply noted dos primaquine give day ; dose give next day onwards normal . A slightly extended case record form ( CRF ) use record timing administration primaquine dose tabular format . 5 . Patients G6PD deficiency discover baseline Patients judge G6PD deficient receive counselling term diagnosis mean , avoid certain drug show G6PD card every time buy drug pharmacy/drug store visit doctor . They provide G6PD deficiency card list drug avoid . 6 . Follow-up Prior go home day 0 , Patients also provide clear verbal instruction term self-monitoring feature haemolysis , advise attend occur . All patient advise return experience side-effects . The Patient Information Sheet explain specifically refers symptom dark urine . The patient re-attend follow-up day 2 , day 7 day 14 follow information record - Medical medication history - Physical examination include vital sign - Capillary blood sample ( finger prick ) - Haemoglobin measurement - Dried blood spot ( d7 d14 ) primaquine carboxyprimaquine . - Day14 G6PD activity measure Biosensor ( subset patient ) - Adverse event assessment focus patient require hospitalisation 7 . Haemolysis stop primaquine Based extensive work already undertaken G6PD RDT , appropriate care , primaquine-induced haemolysis significant problem study . However , important stop primaquine individual sign haemolysis , whatever result initial G6PD RDT . Haemolysis likely manifest early first 48 hour commencement primaquine . The main symptom dark urine ( macroscopic haemoglobinuria ) weakness / tiredness due acute fall haemoglobin . The following criterion use define episode haemolysis require primaquine stop ( reintroduce ) : - Either drop haemoglobin concentration 2g/dl compare baseline - Or absolute haemoglobin concentration le 7 g/dl time The healthcare worker may also stop primaquine administration reason outside criterion . If necessary patient admitted management , refer / transfer elsewhere , per local practice .</detailed_description>
