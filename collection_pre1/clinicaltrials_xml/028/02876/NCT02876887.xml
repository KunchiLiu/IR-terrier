	<brief_title>Cocoa Improve Walking Performance Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic property target pathophysiologic impairment PAD . These therapeutic property include improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial function , increase skeletal muscle capillary density , favorable change skeletal muscle level myostatin follistatin increase muscle mass strength . Cocoa also protect ischemia-reperfusion injury , improve endothelial function , reduces oxidative stress . In summary , epicatechin-rich cocoa target reverse several pathophysiologic process common PAD associate functional impairment functional decline PAD . However , effect chronic daily cocoa consumption functional decline study old people PAD . The COCOA-PAD trial pilot study 44 PAD participant age 65 older : double-blind , randomize control pilot clinical trial provide preliminary data address hypothesis chronic daily epicatechin-rich cocoa improve low extremity function old people PAD improve mitochondrial oxidative metabolism , increase calf muscle capillary density , promote calf skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis , improve endothelial function . In primary aim , investigator determine whether PAD participant randomize epicatechin-rich cocoa beverage great increase small decline six-minute walk performance 6-month follow-up , compare randomized identical appear placebo drink comparable caloric composition . In secondary aim , investigator determine whether PAD participant randomize cocoa improve treadmill walk performance , improve brachial artery flow-mediated dilation , favorable change calf muscle biopsy measure mitochondrial function , mitochondrial biogenesis , follistatin , myostatin , capillary density , increase calf skeletal muscle regeneration reduce oxidative stress , increase MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion . Outcome measure carefully time relative last intervention dose distinguish acute vs. chronic effect cocoa-epicatechin . If hypothesis correct , result use design large , definitive randomize controlled trial epicatechin-rich cocoa improve low extremity function prevent mobility loss large grow number old people disable PAD .</detailed_description>
