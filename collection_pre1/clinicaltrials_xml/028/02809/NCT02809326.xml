	<detailed_description>Background : Troop deployment OIF/OEF extensive past five year Among return veteran , 18.5 % diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . In addition positive symptom ( intrusive thought , reexperiencing , hyperarousal , avoidance ) , PTSD associate social maladjustment , poor quality life , medical comorbidity , general symptom severity . Social emotional problem include social avoidance , guilt , anger , unemployment , impulsive violent behavior , family discord . A majority ( &gt; 90 % ) veterans seek treatment PTSD also seek disability compensation debilitate occupational impairment virtually administrative research data indicate veteran recover PTSD . Exposure therapy , operate long-established fundamental principle behavior therapy , offer hope acute symptom alleviation , may address severe social impairment . Objectives/Hypothesis : To test hypothesis Trauma Management Therapy ( TMT ) , combine individual virtual reality ( VR ) assist exposure therapy group social emotional rehabilitation skill training ( superior treatment consist VR- exposure group psychoeducational group therapy . Outcome assess use relevant clinical , process , cost outcome . Additionally , assess potential olfactory stimulation trigger PTSD symptom intrusive thought re-experiencing . Therefore , proposal integrate clinical neurobiological assessment study design understand role factor etiology , maintenance , treatment PTSD . Specific Aims : There three specific aim : First , evaluate efficacy Trauma Management Therapy ( TMT ) treatment PTSD OIF/OEF determine TMT ( combine exposure social/emotional rehabilitation ) improve social/emotional functioning compare comparison group ( exposure plus psychoeducational group therapy ) . Second , explore olfactory activation pattern may aid understand brain mechanism PTSD . Third , determine TMT 's cost efficacy use treatment expense resource utilization measure . Study Design : In prospective randomized clinical trial test superiority TMT OIF/OEF veteran PTSD compare exposure therapy plus psychoeducational group therapy . TMT combine VR assist exposure therapy ( VR-EXP ) social emotional rehabilitation ( SER ) . In addition clinical , process , cost outcome relevant PTSD population , include fMRI assessment central olfactory system order document hypothesize role fear acquisition maintenance . Relevant outcome domain reassess mid-treatment , post-treatment , 3- 6-month follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Veterans active duty military personnel combatrelated PTSD result deployment Iraq Afghanistan . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Personnel acute cardiac difficulty ( angina , myocardial infarction , severe hypertension ) initially exclude study due concern intensive EXP , often accompany temporary increase heart rate blood pressure , may pose risk exacerbate cardiac status . They include cleared cardiologist . 2 . Veterans comorbid Axis I psychotic disorder acute substance abuse disorder initially exclude study eligible substance abuse control least two week . Additionally , Axis II diagnosis antisocial personality disorder reason exclusion . 3 . Because PTSD typically accompany high rate comorbid psychiatric disorder ( Keane &amp; Wolfe , 1990 ) , patient comorbid depressive disorder , anxiety disorder , personality disorder Antisocial Personality Disorder include . Also , veteran diagnosis mild Traumatic Brain Injury include , order sample representative OIF/OEF veteran possible . We address issue comorbid mTBI data analysis . In case include , PTSD must consider primary disorder . 4 . Patients must symptom duration least 6 month . 5 . Patients benzodiazepine give opportunity discontinue benzodiazepine least two week prior begin study . This exclusion base empirical evidence suggest efficacy EXP anxiety disorder may attenuate benzodiazepine ( Gray , 1987 ; Wardle , 1990 ) . Patients SSRI antidepressant medication PTSD ( Ballenger et al. , 2000 ; Brady et al. , 2000 ) include medication regimen stabilize least 2 week . SSRI medication dosage must remain stable throughout course study .</criteria>
