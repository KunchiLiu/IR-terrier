	<detailed_description>The Dix-Hallpike Test ( DHT ) Canalith Repositioning Maneuver ( CRM ) use diagnose treat Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo ( BPPV ) . BPPV process evidence base clinical practice guideline level . The DHT gold standard test DHT CRM support numerous randomize controlled trial systematic review . The problem BPPV process substantially underutilized . This study look increase use BPPV process within community ED set implement theory-based educational intervention . The unit randomization target intervention hospital . After initial observation period , six community hospital undergo intervention five wave ( small two hospital pair ) . The order randomize . This partner research project local physician engage best practice implementation . Sample Size The trial start initial intervention period approximately 4 month follow randomize stagger intervention new hospital enter approximately every 2 month , finalize approximately 4 post-intervention month result approximately balance number 867 visit occur without intervention 933 visit occur ( post ) intervention . This calculation assume average anticipated total patient visit rate 100 patient per month . Based pilot study literature expect DHT CRM procedure do 5 % patient intervention . With expect number visit calculate , able detect increase DHT CRM rate 9 % 90 % power two-sided test significance level 5 % . We expect much big difference 5 % vs. 20 % pre- vs. post-intervention DHT/CRM rate , respectively . Under expect difference , power exceed 99 % . In fact , order magnitude small visit rate 10.4 patient per month would sufficient 90 % power anticipate difference . The reserve power use provide power fine-tune multivariate mixed regression model associate secondary analysis . Data Analyses The intervention deliver hospital . Intervention binary variable two level , pre-intervention ( intervention ) , post-intervention ( intervention ) . The primary analysis use binary logistic regression include covariates hospital , month ( handle secular trend ) , intervention ( see ) . For set new patient visit , binary random variable DHT/CRM/referral yes/no serve primary response . Patient visit supply patient- , hospital- provider-level covariates well calendar time variable model secular trend , intervention yes/no variable measure whether visit occur intervention . To take hospital- provider-specific unmeasured feature account , hospital provider categorical variable include analysis . Due fact number hospital provider much small number patient visit , adjust hospital provider effect way categorical variable lead bias . Secondary analysis explore alternative approach use random effect ( Gaussian ) model . A two-sided model-based test intervention variable use test primary hypothesis significance level 5 % . The secondary analysis ( safety ) numerically summarize 90-day stroke rate - cumulatively stratify stroke diagnose index dizziness visit post index visit stroke ( delayed diagnosis ) patient see EDs without intervention . This anticipated rare . The intervention target improve stroke diagnosis . However , evaluate index visit stroke diagnosis rate delay diagnosis rate allow determination major change . We anticipate index visit stroke diagnosis rate approximately 2 % delay diagnosis rate approximately 1 % .</detailed_description>
