	<brief_summary>Background : The gas mask use protect aiways respiratory hazard ( CBRN agent ) . Within CBRNE committee , speculation unprotected lung would look like COPD patient post-exposure CBRNE agent . The aim study evaluate impact gas mask respiratory pattern indexes respiratory effort . Methods : We complete study 9 COPD patient evaluate breathe pattern , index respiratory effort blood gas . Three condition test randomized order : 1x baseline 2x different canister , without mask ( C4 , Airboss Defence , Bromont , Canada ) . Airway pressure , inspiratory expiratory flow measure . An esophageal catheter introduce begin study measure esophageal pressure ( Peso ) calculate index respiratory effort ( PTPeso , WOB ) . SpO2 continuously measure capillary blood base draw end condition . Each condition last 10 minute , data last 2 minute steady state consider analysis . Results . We compile data processing analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gas Mask Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) : New Understanding Respiratory Index Impact ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal way penetration CBRNE agent respiratory system . The current technology gas mask use protect respiratory system far back First World War . That originate Dr Cluny Macpherson 's initiative Canadian military physician . The military gas mask part respirator classification owe specific feature . Conventionally , military gas mask cover large spectrum protection aspect match specific canister . Consequently , gas mask usually study separately respirator Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus ( SBCA ) . While study gas mask technology , no-study address regard impact bad airway protection consequence respiratory system . The gas mask design component may lead respiratory load issue . At rest different resistance , would impact work breathe gas exchange ? In order avoid hypoxemia hyperoxia , would optimal mean restore proper oxygenation ? We hypothesise : . Heightened WOB respiratory demand related wear gas mask ; ii . An occurrence hypoxemia manifest continuous period . Our goal measure impact work breathe gas exchange gas mask user also COPD patient . We also measure optimal mean correct hypoxemia subject . 9 COPD patient participate comparison single-blind randomize experimental study . That approve Ethical Review Committee . A write consent obtain subject prior acceptance . No rejection happen recruit far . The eligibility criterion : i. COPD diagnosis mild-to-severe FEV 30-80 % ) . The exclusion criterion : i. Refusals relate wear oesophageal catheter capillary puncture ; ii . Claustrophobia ; iii . Oesophageal wound background ; iv . No coronary background stroke history ; v. No face morphology incompatibility mask . Spirometry usual health screening also do start clinical trial . Design comprise three 10-minute test condition split two part . All rest sit chair : i. Baseline without gas mask ; ii . Gas mask Canister A ; iii . Gas Mask Canister B . Between condition 5-minute wash-out take place . Three five-minute period follow record blood pressure pulse condition . SpO2 continuously measure Free O2 . Capillary puncture do end condition . Comfort also assess . Our main measurement WOB perform continuous record Peso pressure respiratory volume . Software Acknowledge , version 3.9 serf acquisition data system analysis achieve 4.2 version free-trial WOB calculus system , name RESPMAT . That obtain Maynaud al. ( 2014 ) . As power source , use BIOPAC ( MP100 , Santa Barbara , Californie , USA , 200 Hertz ) , four differential sensor ( Validyne : 1x MP45±100 cmH2O ; 2x MP100±5 cmH2O ; 1x MP100±100 cmH2O ) four Carrier D-Modulators ( Validyne , CT-15,120 Volt , 60 Hertz , 5Watts , Model CD15-A-2-A-1 ) . Single esophageal catheter ( Type Cooper , French caliber # 5 ) disposable pneumotachs use . Lidocain spray K-Y gel apply insertion catheter . Its placement do 37.6±5.7 cm across subject Mueller test perform subject . In regard spontaneous breathing , Hudson mask use C-4 Gas Mask canister employ ( Manufacturer : Airboss Defence , Bromont , Canada ) . Canister A B respectively C7A1 ADB81 trademark . Prototyped Free O2 System employ correction hypoxemia .</detailed_description>
