	<brief_summary>The investigator propose one-year , repeated measure , within-subject design examine impact improve caregiver depression child asthma outcome . A cross-lagged panel modeling ( CLPM ) longitudinal data fit use maximum likelihood structural equation model ( SEM ) order explore longitudinal mediation asthma outcome ( asthma control , spirometry , quality life ( QOL ) ) depressive symptom . CLPM test whether caregiver improvement precede child asthma improvement , SEM test whether improve adherence and/or decrease child anxiety/depression mediate effect . The investigator consider randomized control trial , would ethically acceptable withhold medication caregiver diagnose Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) propose one-year duration study . It unlikely potential participant study would find acceptable .
