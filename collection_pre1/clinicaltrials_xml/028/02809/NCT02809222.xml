	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) group heterogeneous life threaten disease characterise clonal evolution dysplastic myeloid hematopoietic stem cell . This evolution initially associate excess apoptosis follow excess proliferation , accumulation cytogenetic mutation , transformation acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) appear . Evolution MDS also associate increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . In MDS mouse , perturbation metabolism ROS associate increase number cytogenetic mutation . Ascorbic acid ( AA ) actor regulation oxidative metabolism human body . In vitro study show supplementation AA change proliferation status MDS cell . Guinea pig phenotype excess ROS supplement AA less somatic mutation less MDS . Adjuvant treatment AA associate beneficial effect evolution MDS AML . To knowledge study demonstrate variation parameter oxidative metabolism evolution MDS . The present study aim describe variation plasmatic ascorbic acid concentration healthy volunteer patient diagnose MDS treatment recently diagnose follow-up 12 month . During follow-up collection plasma volunteer patient create later analysis .</detailed_description>
