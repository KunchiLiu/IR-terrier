	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral entrapment neuropathy involve compression median nerve carpal tunnel . Rather progressive disease , CTS characterize remission recurrence . Although many conservative management CTS , effectiveness method insignificant persist short duration . Recently , ultrasound-guided perineural injection 5 % dextrose widely use entrapment neuropathy positive benefit . However , current study entirely prove effect perineural injection peripheral neuropathy study enrol small number patient lack controlled design . The investigator design randomize , double-blind , control trail ass effect ultrasound-guided perineural injection 5 % dextrose patient CTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent , patient clinically diagnosed CTS randomize intervention control group . Participants intervention group receive one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection 5 % dextrose control group receive one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection normal saline . No additional treatment injection study period . The primary outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) secondary outcome include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) median nerve , sensory nerve conduction velocity median nerve , finger pinch strength . The evaluation perform pretreatment well 2nd , 4th , 8th , 12th , 16th 24th week treatment .</detailed_description>
