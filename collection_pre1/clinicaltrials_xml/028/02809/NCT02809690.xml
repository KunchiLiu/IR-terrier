	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well fluorine F 18 d-FMAU ( 18F-FMAU ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work diagnose characterize prostate cancer . A PET/CT scan image test use small amount radioactive tracer give vein take detailed picture area inside body tracer take . Radiotracers 18F-FMAU may help find cancer see far disease spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FMAU PET/CT Diagnosing Characterizing Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform prospective clinical image evaluation 18F-FMAU PET/CT addition multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) standard transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided 12-core biopsy detection localization primary tumor 40 men suspect prostate cancer base elevated/rising prostate specific antigen level , abnormal digital rectal exam , prior negative standard biopsy return standard care follow-up . II . To examine association PET derive image parameter , serum PSA , mpMRI parameter ( apparent diffusion coefficient [ ADC ] , Ktrans ) biopsy histopathology parameter . OUTLINE : Patients receive radiotracer F 18 d-FMAU intravenously ( IV ) 1 minute undergo 18F-FMAU PET/CT day 1 . Patients undergo standard care multiparametic MRI standard care transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24-96 hour .</detailed_description>
