	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate PEMF Therapy Experimentally Inducted Pain Subjects With Painful Peripheral Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled crossover clinical trial conduct subject painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy . Eligible subject include 22 80 year age Type 2 diabetes persistent pain , numbness , tingle , and/or burn least one foot . Pain threshold , tolerance thermal stimuli pressure response induce pain stimulus measure three time point use five standardized experimental pain measure : baseline , single 30 minute treatment active PEMF sham treatment second 30 minute treatment active PEMF sham treatment . Eligible subject painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy undergo Diabetic Screening ( Nerve Conduction Velocity , Skin Perfusion Pressure , Ankle-Brachial Index , Vibratory Testing ) index foot prior randomization . Following Diabetic Screening test , subject return research center Enrollment/Randomization Visit complete measure pain complete Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) functional assessment . Subjects randomly assign one two group ; control ( sham ) experimental ( active ) device research assistant blind device status . Patients also randomly assign sequence order experimental induce pain test . The ischemic pain testing ( SMET ) always conduct last . Patients return research center within 7 day Enrollment/Randomization Visit cross treatment assignment randomly assign sequence order experimental induce pain test extremity previously randomize .</detailed_description>
