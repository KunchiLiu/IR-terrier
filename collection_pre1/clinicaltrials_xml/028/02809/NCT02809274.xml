	<brief_title>Incidence Iron Deficiency Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) Association With Disease Features</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Within intestinal epithelial cell , import iron incorporate ferritin storage form . A fraction iron take intestinal lumen pass cell , export across basolateral membrane enter body . Ferroportin , metal ion transporter , serve basolateral iron exporter . Hepcidin regulate basolateral iron export bind ferroportin trigger internalization lysosomal degradation . Each day , normal adult need 25 mg iron support hemoglobin production mature erythrocyte . This amount much great iron absorb daily intestine . Obviously , iron need erythropoiesis must acquire supply already exist body . The primary source plasma iron reticuloendothelial macrophage system , recovers iron senescent damage erythrocyte . Other significant site iron exchange liver . Dietary iron absorption enhance response insufficient iron store , increase erythropoietic demand hypoxia . It diminish response iron surfeit inflammation . Based observation , four different `` regulator '' define functionally : 1 ) The store regulator modulates absorption several fold , increase iron deficiency decrease iron overload . 2 ) The erythroid regulator potent—it increase iron absorption 6- 10-fold erythropoiesis become iron -restricted , result either iron deficiency accelerate production erythroid precursor . 3 ) The hypoxia regulator mediate increase iron absorption response hypoxia , allow production hemoprotein bind carry oxygen . 4 ) An inflammatory regulator also exist , act decrease iron absorption response inflammation . All regulator act common , humoral effector coordinate intestinal iron absorption macrophage iron recycle . Hepcidin play major role iron metabolism . It produce liver , cleave large precursor molecule secrete plasma . Circulating hepcidin attache ferroportin express enterocytes macrophage , cause ferroportin internalize cell degrade lysosomes . Hepcidin induced response iron overload inflammation . It turn response iron deficiency , ineffective erythropoiesis hypoxia . Polycythemia vera ( PV ) one myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) characterize marrow hyperplasia increase number erythrocyte , leukocytes platelet peripheral blood . Several study show iron deficiency common PV patient significantly influence quality life . These complication result expansive erythropoiesis , addition phlebotomy and/or gastrointestinal bleeding . The role JAK2V617F pathogenesis iron deficiency PV also intrigue . Kinase JAK2 involve signal transduction via erythropoietin receptor . EPO one hepcidin synthesis regulator . Some data confirm JAK2 mutation may involve regulation iron status myeloproliferative disorder . There several report literature thrombotic complication iron-deficient adult . Secondary thrombocytosis implicate many case . In addition increase thrombotic risk associate high platelet count , decrease antioxidant defense iron deficiency may cause increase oxidant stress , turn may result tendency toward platelet aggregation . The abnormal platelet count function observe iron deficiency anemia could act synergistically promote thrombus formation . Iron deficiency may contribute hypercoagulable state affect blood flow pattern within vessel reduce deformability increase viscosity microcytic red blood cell . Purpose : Incidence effect iron deficiency patient PV well characterize . The study assess incidence iron deficiency diagnosis course PV , assess effect iron deficiency patient symptom correlation disease feature .</detailed_description>
