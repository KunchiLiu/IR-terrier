	<brief_summary>Apixaban anticoagulant increasingly use prevent stroke atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Phase III clinical trial demonstrate apixaban efficacious safe overall AF population ; however , patient older age 85 , creatinine clearance &lt; 40mL/min , weigh &lt; 50kg poorly represent trial , yet commonly see real-world clinical scenario . Advanced age , poor renal function , low body weight associate elevated drug level , elevate drug level associate increase risk bleeding . Therefore , clinician concern risk bleed unsure best treat patient population . Although anticoagulant available , apixaban attractive low rate bleeding , low dependence kidney clearance , require frequent ongoing monitoring dose adjustment . This study include patient take apixaban well-represented phase III trial - age &gt; 85 , creatinine clearance &lt; 40mL/min , weight &lt; 50kg - also increase risk elevate drug level due clinical characteristic . Participants apixaban level measure , persistently elevate level dose reduce . Drug level measure dose reduction determine level reduce without become dangerously low .</brief_summary>
