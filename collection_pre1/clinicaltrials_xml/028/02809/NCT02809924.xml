	<brief_summary>This study compare use simulation-based just-in-time training video train learn neonatal endotracheal intubation . Half participant train use simulation-based just-in-time training half use video training . The hypothesis Primary hypothesis : In Neonatal Intensive Care Unit , use simulation-based just-in-time training , compare video training , increase rate successful clinical endotracheal intubation 20 % . Secondary hypothesis : The investigator expect simulation-based just-in-time training prior clinical endotracheal intubation decrease time successful intubation rate endotracheal intubation related adverse event , namely mucosal trauma , oesophageal endobronchial intubation . In addition , investigator expect simulation-based just-in-time training increase resident ' confidence level perform clinical endotracheal intubation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study prospective randomize controlled trial , take place NICU CHU Sainte-Justine Montréal , Quebec , Canada . Simulation-based just-in-time training Simulation-based just-in-time training , complete perform endotracheal intubation , consist view short video show neonatal glottis similar gestational age patient intubate followed practice mannequin ( Laerdal® Neonatal Intubation Trainer , Laerdal Medical , Toronto , Canada ) supervision feedback senior provider ( low fidelity simulation ) . The videos neonatal glottis locally create , parent consent , use live recording endotracheal intubation perform C-MAC videolarygnoscope ( Karl Storz GmbH &amp; Co. KG , Tuttlingen , Germany ) . The low fidelity simulation perform situ physician meeting room neonatal intensive care unit . Senior provider instruct also educate resident different aspect related procedure : indication , contraindication , anatomy , equipment , personnel , potential complication , appropriate aftercare common pitfall . Video train Residents watch 5 minute video regard endotracheal intubation , cover follow topic : indication , contraindication , anatomy , equipment , personnel , procedural step , potential complication , appropriate aftercare common pitfall . Definitions 1 . Intubation success endotracheal tube place trachea vocal cord . It define accord usual clinical norm : change color carbon dioxide detector , vapour endotracheal tube , thoracic expansion , assessment bilateral lung air entry , absence air entry stomach auscultation , improvement patient 's clinical parameter : heart rate arterial oxygen saturation . 2 . Time intubation define time insertion laryngoscope blade patient ' mouth pull . 3 . Oesophageal intubation diagnose absence clinical sign successful endotracheal intubation possibly air entry stomach auscultation . 4 . Right bronchial main stem intubation diagnose chest x-ray . 5 . A trial count attempt insertion laryngoscope blade patient 's mouth .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All resident register three first year general paediatrics program University Montreal approach participate study . All endotracheal intubation procedure attempt paediatric resident neonatal intensive care unit CHU SainteJustine include study , regardless patient weight gestational age . Trainees : No exclusion criterion . Patients major oral , cervical upper airway malformation , urgent endotracheal intubation inability prepare Justintime train material , unexpected difficult endotracheal intubation ( need assistance anaesthetist ) .</criteria>
