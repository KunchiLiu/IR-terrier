	<brief_summary>Relapsed acute myeloblastic leukemia ( AML ) require remission prior allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) optimal survival , disease poor response chemotherapy . Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) haploidentical , Natural killer ( NK ) enrich peripheral blood cell infusion show safety patient poor prognosis AML . Though powered assessment , trial show promising statistically significant trend remission rate . NK cell therapy limit small number NK cell attainable leukapheresis . We demonstrate large number NK cell propagate ex vivo small volume blood draw , obviate need donor leukapheresis . The purpose trial determine feasibility maximum tolerate dose expand NK cell estimate toxicity treat relapsed/refractory AML fludarabine + high-dose cytarabine + G-CSF ( FLAG ) chemotherapy follow haploidentical expand natural killer ( NK ) cell . The first NK cell dose cohort well currently-established safe dose pheresis-derived NK cell , expand NK cell may increase toxicity activate phenotype . In order avoid accrue patient suboptimal dos , dose escalation schema base principle accelerate titration design use study allow expeditious advancement current safe dose NK cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While grow NK cell blood lab , mismatch T cell may also grow , cause reaction normal tissue call graft-vs-host disease ( GvHD ) . In lab , T cell remove cell product use special magnet antibody-coated magnetic bead . The drug aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ) add NK cell improve function . The aldesleukin wash cell product give . The NK cell donate family member certain genetic type blood call HLA partly match . If agree take part study , assign dose level NK cell base join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue 6 dose level high tolerable dose NK cell find . One ( 1 ) 10 participant treat dose level . The day receive first NK cell infusion call Day 0 . The day receive NK cell infusion call minus day ( D- ) . The day receive NK cell infusion call plus day ( D+ ) . Study Drug Administration : On Day -7 , admit hospital give fluid vein hydrate . On Days -6 , -5 , -4 , -3 , -2 , receive fludarabine vein 30 minute . About 4 hour later , receive cytarabine vein 1 hour . If 60 year old old , `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy ) Day -2 . On Day -1 , rest . Three ( 3 ) time week 2 week , receive NK cell vein 30 minute . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . You receive filgrastim injection skin 1 time day , start Day -7 continue white blood cell level high enough . Filgrastim design help growth white blood cell . Study Visits : Before treatment start : Your medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Before NK cell infusion : Your medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . The amount oxygen blood measure place sensor tip finger . Twice week , blood count low , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Once blood count high enough , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test week Day +56 . Once blood count high enough around Day +28 ( whichever earlier ) , bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease DNA test check cell bone marrow NK cell donor 's . To collect bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test genetic makeup function infuse NK cell check status disease : Before treatment start . Before 1-3 hour NK cell infusion . Once day Days +14 , +16 , +18 , +21 , weekly Day +56 . Length Study : Your participation study Day +56 . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , enough NK cell collect , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Cytarabine , fludarabine , filgrastim FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . The investigational part study find best dose NK cell give goal help prevent cancer come back . The way researcher process NK cell investigational FDA approve . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol Cellular Therapy Center ( HCPA )</detailed_description>
