	<brief_summary>This research clinical trial study high definition single cell analysis blood tissue sample patient colorectal cancer spread liver . High definition single cell analysis allow doctor study property cancer cell sometimes find blood patient determine gene protein may change time . Studying sample patient colorectal cancer laboratory may help doctor learn cancer spread , well predict disease outcomes patient cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine level correlation solid tumor touch preparation liquid biopsy ( circulate tumor cell [ CTCs ] ) patient surgically resect colorectal cancer ( CRC ) metastases liver use single-cell high-content analysis , include gene copy number variation ( CNV ) establish one bio-signatures represent liquid solid biopsy correlation patient patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate technical validity reproducibility bio-signatures compare two pre-resection liquid biopsy sample draw one week prior day surgery . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare biosignatures pre-surgical post-surgical blood sample . II . Compare biosignatures resect metastatic liver tumor tissue , primary colon tumor tissue ( available ) , pre-surgical blood sample . III . Compare biosignatures blood sample prior resection obtain resection time recurrence . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood collection 1 week prior surgery , surgery day , 1 week 3 month surgery . Patients also undergo tissue collection surgery . Blood tissue sample process high definition single cell analysis include whole-genome CNV profile , protein expression , cell morphology . After completion study , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
