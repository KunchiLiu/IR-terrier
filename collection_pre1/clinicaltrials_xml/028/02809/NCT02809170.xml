	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial disease occur due inadequate energy production . In addition , nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency occur mitochondrial disease . The endothelial layer blood vessel function maintain blood vessel patency produce NO relaxes vascular smooth muscle therefore maintains patency blood vessel adequate blood perfusion . In mitochondrial disease , endothelial cell fail perform normal function maintain patency blood vessel ( endothelial dysfunction ) inability produce enough NO . Endothelial dysfunction result decrease blood perfusion different organ contribute complication see mitochondrial disease . The amino acid arginine citrulline act NO precursor increase NO production . In study hypothesize due inability produce enough NO patient mitochondrial disease endothelial dysfunction improve arginine citrulline supplementation . The investigator assess endothelial function use peripheral arterial tonometry arginine citrulline supplementation . The investigator expect arginine citrulline supplementation improve endothelium function . This support therapeutic use arginine citrulline mitochondrial disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator study 10 child mitochondrial disease 10 healthy control child . The investigator study control child able compare result child mitochondrial disease control healthy child . Therefore , investigator study control child compare result result child mitochondrial disease baseline . To assess effect arginine citrulline child mitochondrial disease , investigator need assess child mitochondrial disease four time . First time baseline . Then child mitochondrial disease randomize receive either oral arginine citrulline dose 500 mg/kg/day divide 3 dos daily 2 week second assessment perform . Oral arginine citrulline discontinue two-week washout period another baseline assessment do . After , child start oral citrulline ( participant receive arginine first time ) arginine ( participant receive citrulline first time ) dose 500 mg/kg/day divide 3 dos daily 2 week fourth assessment do .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis mitochondrial disease multiorgan disease involve neurological and/or muscular system . 2 . The diagnosis must confirm either molecularly ( identify mutation know associated mitochondrial disease ) respiratory chain assay abnormality . 1 . Have acute illness physical disability interfere ability undergo study procedure . 2 . Known factor know result endothelial dysfunction include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes .</criteria>
