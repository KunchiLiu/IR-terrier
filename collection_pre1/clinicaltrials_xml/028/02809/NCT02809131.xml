	<detailed_description>1.0 Background The number cardiac implantable electronic device ( CIEDs ) implant year grown rapidly past two decade , largely due expand use implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) device capable deliver cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) . CIEDs increasingly utilized old patient multiple medical comorbidities . As result CIED infection , define infection involve generator implant site ( pocket ) and/or intravascular lead , become increasingly prevalent , rate growth infection outpace CIED procedure . The increase incidence CIED infection outpace growth device implantation , large part due medical complexity today 's CIED patient . These devastate complication associate significant cost , morbidity , mortality . The odds short term long term mortality least doubled patient suffer CIED infection , long term survival particularly poor woman . Patient-specific risk factor CIED infection examine multiple registry case-control study . For patient least two risk factor , report incidence CIED infection 2-3 % . Management infection complex expensive . The cornerstone management complete removal infect hardware whenever possible , pose significant risk patient . Therefore prevention infection crucial . Best practice reduce CIED infection active area research . Since infection occur result bacterial seeding time device implantation revision , careful attention strict sterile technique mandatory . Optimal skin preparation perioperative intravenous antibiotic associate reduced rate CIED infection randomize controlled study . Additionally , several recent retrospective study suggest important role minocycline rifampin impregnate TYRX antibacterial envelope reduce infection . The device consist 2 polypropylene mesh sheet join 3 side 3mm seam available 2 size accommodate pacemaker ICD pulse generator . This polypropylene envelope release minocycline rifampin bioresorbable polyarylate polymer approximately 7 day , directly CIED generator pocket . Aside optimal skin preparation perioperative intravenous antibiotic , practice reduce risk CIED infection vary widely . Many operator use antibacterial solution ( e.g. , polymyxin-B/bacitracin ) irrigate pocket device implantation . Additionally , many center adopt routine use prophylactic postoperative antibiotic reduce risk CIED infection . However , neither strategy evaluate randomized clinical study . Antibacterial irrigation solution expensive , oral antibiotic associate small yet clinically important risk adverse effect , include Clostridium difficile infection . Therefore , prospective randomize study need evaluate efficacy , safety , cost-effectiveness intraoperative antibacterial rinse postoperative oral antibiotic . Summary significance : CIED infection constitute major complication device implantation revision become increasingly prevalent . Infections associate increased morbidity , mortality , cost , difficult treat . Recent study explore way reduce incidence CIED infection , use TYRX antibacterial envelope emerge potential strategy prevention . Other strategy include intraoperative antibacterial irrigation postoperative oral antibiotic commonly use despite lack prospective study document efficacy , safety , cost-effectiveness . We others report low incidence ( &lt; 1 % ) CIED infection high-risk patient receive TYRX antibacterial envelope . One intriguing possibility antibacterial envelope use instead intraoperative antibacterial rinse postoperative oral antibiotic . Therefore , important knowledge gap exist best practice prevent CIED infection high-risk individual . 2.0 Rationale Specific Aims SPECIFIC AIM : test hypothesis use TYRX antibacterial envelope alone noninferior strategy use antibacterial envelope intraoperative antibacterial irrigant postoperative oral antibiotic reduction cardiac implantable device infection patient ≥2 risk factor infection . CIED infection devastate yet potentially preventable complication . We previously conduct retrospective study TYRX antibacterial envelope find use device patient ≥2 risk factor CIED infection associate markedly decreased infection rate ( 0.4 % device versus 3 % without , adjust odds ratio [ 95 % confidence interval ] : 0.09 [ 0.01 0.73 ] , P =0.02 ) . All patient previous study intraoperative irrigation device pocket polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution receive routine postoperative oral antibiotic consistent local practice . However , whether use intraoperative irrigant postoperative antibiotic reduces risk infection evaluate prospective , randomized trial . Moreover , unknown whether treatment offer incremental benefit use TYRX antibacterial envelope alone . Given significant cost polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution concern unnecessary use oral antibiotic emerge resistant microorganism , critically important establish whether treatment offer incremental benefit patient high risk CIED infection receive TYRX antibacterial envelope . The Specific Aim study prospectively test hypothesis infection risk-reduction strategy use TYRX antibacterial envelope alone noninferior strategy use envelope intraoperative antibacterial irrigant postoperative oral antibiotic patient undergo CIED procedure least 2 CIED infection risk factor . 3.0 Previous Animal Human Studies The TYRX antibacterial envelope effectively prevent CIED infection animal model . In animal model direct bacterial inoculation device pocket , TYRX antibacterial envelope show excellent activity Staphylococcus epidermidis , Staphylococcus capitis , Escherichia coli , Acinetobacter baumannii . Importantly , systemic level minocycline rifampin undetectable . Use TYRX antibacterial envelope associate reduced incidence CIED infection retrospective study high-risk patient . In multi-center trial , use TYRX antibacterial envelope associate low risk CIED infection ( 0.5 % ) . However , relatively short follow-up period ( mean : 1.9 month ) lack control arm limit interpretation study 's result . We conduct retrospective control study TYRX antibacterial envelope patient least 2 CIED infection risk factor institution . Among 260 TYRX envelope recipient , incidence CIED infection mean 18.7 month follow-up period 0.4 % , compare 3 % 639 high-risk control receive envelope ( adjust odds ratio : 0.09 , 95 % confidence interval 0.01 0.73 , P =0.02 ) . Another retrospective study high-volume center find prevalence CIED infection decrease 1.5 % 0.6 % TYRX antibacterial envelope institute practice ( P =0.03 ) . Based study , Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope CIED Infection Prevention Trial ( WRAP-IT ) conceive . This landmark trial prospectively evaluate efficacy TYRX-A antibacterial envelope . However , propose study complementary WRAP-IT trial specifically evaluate whether TYRX-A antibacterial envelope alone offer ample protection CIED infection without use intraoperative antibacterial solution postoperative oral antibiotic . 6.0 Study Procedures Device implantation follow-up . CIED procedure perform accordance establish practice guideline . Perioperative procedure reduce risk CIED infection include optimal skin preparation intravenous antibiotic ( cefazolin vancomycin ) apply patient . All patient receive TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope . Patients randomize intraoperative antibacterial irrigant/postoperative oral antibiotic ( control ) arm undergo irrigation device pocket 1 liter polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution . Patients control arm also receive 3 day postoperative oral antibiotic ( cephalexin 500mg 3 time daily , clindamycin 300mg 3 time daily , levofloxacin 500mg daily ) per investigator routine order practice discretion per individual patient . Patients randomize experimental arm receive intraoperative antibacterial irrigation ( allow 1 liter sterile saline irrigation ) , post-operative oral antibiotic . All patient follow procedure accord establish practice guideline . At minimum , patient see 4 week procedure wound check , 6 month , every year frequently dictate patient 's clinical status . A digital photograph device pocket capture 4-week postoperative visit . In addition , study nurse telephone patient 3 month implantation ass symptom sign infection . For purpose study , patient continue follow minimum 6 month procedure , additional follow-up data six month may collect continuously study close . Ascertainment primary endpoint : CIED infection minimum 6-month follow-up period . The primary study endpoint CIED infection result complete CIED system removal , antibiotic therapy patient candidate system removal , death due CIED infection . To avoid detection bias prospectively apply criterion definition primary endpoint ask treat physician thoroughly document objective finding . Examples objective sign CIED infection . Objective finding CIED infection - Fever leukocytosis without alternative explanation ( e.g. , urinary tract infection pneumonia ) - Tenderness , erythema , warmth pulse generator site - Purulent discharge pulse generator site ( incision fistula ) - Positive blood pulse generator site culture - Vegetation adherent CIED hardware - Purulent material within pulse generator pocket upon reoperation A digital photograph device pocket capture routinely postoperative visit whenever CIED infection consideration . In case suspect CIED infection , treat physician strongly encourage obtain peripheral blood culture prior initiation antibiotic therapy intraoperative culture CIED system removal . A panel 3 physician coordinate center blind study assignment ( experimental versus control ) independently adjudicate outcome `` real time '' vote whether criterion CIED infection meet . A minor superficial infection incision involve generator pocket , result systemic symptom sign , treat either observation short course oral antibiotic , count CIED infection consider secondary endpoint . Study oversight : The principal investigator study sight responsible aspect study respective site . To ensure fidelity study protocol , independent study coordinator Vanderbilt University directly involve study review upon initiation study first patient enrol site , random selection ( 10 % ) patient record site ( include Vanderbilt University ) continuous basis set monitoring agreement throughout duration study , quarterly prepare report study 's principal investigator .</detailed_description>
