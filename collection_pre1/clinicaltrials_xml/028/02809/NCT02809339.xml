	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer major cause cancer relate death among woman . The disease usually advanced diagnosis , specialist referral delay due vague nature present symptom . Primary treatment successful , patient experience recurrence . Complaints due disease therapy overlap . Furthermore treatment schedule similar response rate survival rate . Toxicity therapy score physician best document , varies depend type chemotherapy . Moreover knowledge acquire clinical trial daily practice . Patient report outcome ( PROs ) concern effect symptom , velocity relief quality life ( QoL ) different regimen sparce . Also unknown symptom best relieve . Most trial take account progression survival primary endpoint often symptom relief , especially important patient recurrent disease , without chance cure anymore . Knowledge rating problem need patient recurrent ovarian cancer ( ROC ) support course disease need come evidence base patient center treatment choice together patient . Physicians frequently use Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) scale grade side effect treatment , discrepancy patient experience high . Routine collection PROs may therefore improve patient expectation management . In project investigator intend augment knowledge PROs different chemotherapy schedule recurrent ovarian cancer order improve share decision make physician . Objective : primary objective project explore relief symptom due ROC , speed occur different chemotherapy schedule development complaint due regimen chemotherapy . Secondary investigator intend ( 1 ) ass preferential symptom relief patient , ( 2 ) correlate toxicity symptom disease tumor assess response chemotherapy ( 3 ) correlate symptom relief psychosocial context .</brief_summary>
