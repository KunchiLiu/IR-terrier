	<brief_summary>In proof concept study , investigator aim determine supplementation coconut oil cause increase cholecystokinin cholecystokinin receptor expression airway smooth muscle lean asthmatic , whether change correlate change airway stiffness ( estimate bronchodilator reversibility , airway reactivity , airway resistance ) symptom control . The investigator propose 5 week , single center trial 20 lean patient mild asthma ( take inhale corticosteroid ) age 18 old . Subjects supplement usual diet 3 tablespoon coconut oil , commercially available oil high dodecanoic acid content , 3 week . To quantify change airway smooth muscle cholecystokinin cholecystokinin-receptor expression , subject undergo bronchoscopy endobronchial biopsy coconut oil ingestion . For secondary analysis , subject also complete spirometry bronchodilator testing , methacholine challenge , body plethysmography , Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) dietary intervention . This information use compare change airway smooth muscle cholecystokinin cholecystokinin receptor expression change bronchodilator reversibility , airway reactivity , airway resistance , symptom control . In exploratory aim , investigator correlate change airway smooth muscle cholecystokinin cholecystokinin receptor expression change FEV1 peak flow measurement . The investigator therefore hope elucidate information mechanistic role cholecystokinin airway smooth muscle stiffness contraction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>20 lean ( BMI &lt; 25 ) nonsmoker least 18 year age mild asthma recruit Asthma Research Center database . A sample size 12 asthmatic need 80 % power detect 3-fold increase cholecystokinin ( CCK ) post dodecanoic acid ingestion alpha level 0.05 , assume standard deviation ≤2.25 cycle scale . To account probable incomplete retention , 20 subject recruit . While calculated standard deviation 1.775 , investigator choose base calculation large standard deviation small sample size . Study subject ask come 5 visit , describe detail . Visit 1 : Eligibility Screen Pre-screened Volunteers ask take short act bronchodilator ipratropium within 6 hour visit . They complete medical history include detailed information past current asthma medication , ACQ , physical exam weight/BMI check spirometry bronchodilator test . They undergo body plethysmography measure baseline airway resistance . Visit 2 : Eligibility Screen , methacholine challenge Subjects return point 1-4 week allow visit 1 3 . They tell take short act bronchodilator ipratropium within 8 hour visit avoid caffeine ( coffee , tea , cola drink , chocolate ) day visit . This visit short , comprised methacholine challenge , measure baseline airway reactivity . Visit 3 : Bronchoscopy Eligible subject ask take aspirin , anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin ) antiplatelet ( e.g. , clopidogrel ) medication 7 day prior second visit . They also tell eat drink within 6hrs visit . At begin visit , subject instruct use peak flow meter . Baseline peak flow measurement record . They undergo bronchoscopy endobronchial biopsy . The investigator perform laser capture biopsy sample isolate smooth muscle cell quantify cell ' CCK cholecystokinin receptor ( CCK-AR ) content via quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The study participant instruct supplement usual diet 3 tablespoon coconut oil ( 21.6g dodecanoic acid , 375 calorie ) daily three week . The oil consume uncooked chemical form unaltered . It swallow tablespoon mixed into/spread food . The investigator recommend take place fatty food rather add subject 's diet , subject ' overall daily caloric intake increase ( subject gain weight ) . The average adult ingest 0.8g dodecanoic acid daily , accord 2004 NHANES report . Dodecanoic acid present particularly high concentration coconut oil ( 50 % dodecanoic acid weight ) . While degree ingest dodecanoic acid reach plasma airway smooth muscle cell unknown , prior trial confirm rise plasma concentration similar fatty acid ( include gama linolenic acid , stearidonic acid , alpha linolenic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ) supplementation little 0.25-4g daily 3 week . The investigator choose maximize supplement dose ( 20g ) possible effect dodecanoic acid airway smooth muscle miss . The 3 week duration model aforementioned study . The investigator provide subject Drug Diary peak flow meter . Subjects instructed keep track daily coconut oil ingestion peak flow measurement . They tell measure peak flow daily 5 11 , prior use morning inhaler , call study coordinator experience change asthma symptom measurement drop 20 % baseline . In addition , study investigator call subject weekly encourage compliance ensure subject question adverse event . Visit 4 : Followup exam , ACQ , pulmonary function test After 3 week coconut oil ingestion , subject return repeat physical exam weight/BMI check methacholine challenge . They fill second ACQ continue supplement diet coconut oil visit 5 . Visit 5 : Followup pulmonary function test , second bronchoscopy Subjects return 1-3 day later visit 5 . They tell take aspirin , anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin ) antiplatelet ( e.g. , clopidogrel ) medication 7 day prior final visit , eat drink within 6hrs visit . The investigator formally review subject 's Drug Diary peak flow measurement . Eligible subject undergo spirometry , bronchodilator reversibility testing , body plethysmography , bronchoscopy endobronchial biopsy . The investigator process sample compare post-fatty acid ingestion outcome baseline value .</detailed_description>
