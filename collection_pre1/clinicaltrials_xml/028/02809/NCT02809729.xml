	<brief_summary>Breast cancer frequent malignancy female population Brazilian , except non-melanoma skin tumor . Surgery play important role regional spot disease control definition parameter adjuvant treatment indication . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) define wound infection occur follow invasive procedure , correspond 14-16 % infection nosocomial hospitalized patient , common among patient surgical . SSIs examine potential wound contamination surgical , understood number micro-organisms body / tissue operate . Considering aspect , cancer surgery breast classify potential contamination clean . The use antibiotic prevent SSI mastectomy standardize Handbook National Health Surveillance Agency due effectiveness undocumented prophylaxis Thus use antibiotic may vary among service . So randomized clinical trial evaluate influence use Prophylactic antibiotic SSI rate oncological breast surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>KIND OF STUDY : Primary , clinical , prospective , randomize , two-parallel-group , double-blind , control , interventional , analytical . SAMPLE CALCULATION : base proportion observe previous study without antibiotic use breast surgery ( VEIGA-Filho , 2010 ) number calculate patient per group 62 , significance level 5 % power 80 % test . SELECTION : select Mastology outpatient clinic 124 female patient undergo breast surgery malignancy . The selection patient divide two group PLACEBO ( N = 62 ) : receive 0.9 % saline 100 ml intravenously CEFAZOLIN GROUP ( N = 62 ) : receive 2 g cefazolin dilute 0.9 % saline endovenous . In group pass standardized manner , sterile swab soak saline standard 5cm 10cm area determine field fenestrated sterile filter paper . Preoperatively default collection region high interquadrantes breast operated immediately areolopapilar complex , include designated area collection . At end surgery also first postoperative day , sterile field position fenestration wound . Tha material Standard microbiological method use identify microoganismos . 0.2 ml aliquot sample plat agar medium hypertonic mannitol , selective Staphylococcus sp , Sabouraud agar chloramphenicol ( 0.05mg / ml ) , selective fungi , agar EMB Teague , selective enterobacteria , agar blood , presence hemolytic colony . After 48 hour , read number colony form unit hold microbiologist . Patients regularly monitor occurrence infection , week first 30 day single surgeon . They use definition surgical site infection classification adopt CDC</detailed_description>
