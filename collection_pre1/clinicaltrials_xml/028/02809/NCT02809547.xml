	<brief_summary>It important patient suffer Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) disease monitor early stage , well establish . Presently , patient assess mean disease activity score blood test , must attend hospital appointment , difficult patient live far clinic . It would beneficial able monitor reliably define report disease 'flare ' home . Quite often , time patient attends appointment , flare ups subside . This study evaluate possibility patient take blood sample comfort home , transfer finger prick blood droplet dry blood spot sample ( DBSS ) card . Patients would send card laboratory test clinically relevant protein marker . The feasibility 'remote ' monitoring patient 's disease explore .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RADAR1- Trial New Blood Sample Method ( Remote Arthritis Disease Activity MonitoR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In arthritis patient population live distance hospital , collection series blood sample monitor disease activity timely fashion difficult . The ability monitor marker inflammation , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) gauge patient 's response treatment via disease activity score ( i.e . DAS28-ESR ) important early stage disease also patient establish disease . Patients chronic disease tend lose self-confidence manage condition substantial proportion suffer recurrent disease flare- ups . These flare-up costly term appointment GP specialist clinic result significant work disability . Being able reliably define report disease 'flare ' arthritis currently problematic objective measure available patient home . The clear definition flare , determine blood test would help justify increase immunosuppressant dose course steroid . Currently , patient make visit GP hospital clinic , 6 week interval best . In reality , mean opportunity monitor CRP active 'flare ' often miss inform intervention ( medication adjustment ) possible . Home monitoring constrain cost make phlebotomist available make frequent home visit patient . Also markers unstable ambient temperature , blood sample need refrigerate rapidly transported laboratory analysis . Thus ability patient collect blood sample home send ambient temperature laboratory would enable 'remote ' timely monitoring chronic disease . The investigator recently complete Arthritis Research UK fund clinical study demonstrate number clinically relevant protein relate flare ( i.e. ? ) reliably collect , store less three month extract dry blood spot ( n=20 arthritis patient ) . The paper card use collect blood droplet pre-treated stabilise protein minimise haemolysis contamination ( caused burst breakdown red blood cell ) . Our result across 20 arthritis patient reveal 90 % recovery rate achieve dried blood spot sample ( DBSS ) store room temperature 3 month ( relative match -20 ' C frozen plasma sample ) . The inflammation marker proteins include C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumour necrosis factor alpha Immunoglobulin G. Without pre-treatment DBSS paper , 53 % protein recover . For patient , use DBSS mean GP hospital visit take blood carry test could reduce . With minimal training , sample would obtain simply home patient , six week period transport room temperature use conventional post . Proteins could analyse central lab . In future , technology could accompany patient assessment disease activity complement ongoing study focus wearable sensor measure joint movement stiffness ( UU Data-glove project ) . For hospital trust , use novel technology could obviate need patient attend clinic blood sampling . Soon prescribe new treatment , clinician could use DBSS monitor treatment efficacy reduce inflammation . This technology therefore offer earlier opportunity currently available titre dosage switch ineffective drug treatment associated adverse event . Furthermore , feedback monitoring information provide DBSS could give patient , via example smartphone application , potential improve adherence treatment plan .</detailed_description>
