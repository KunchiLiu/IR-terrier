	<brief_title>A Pilot Study MSCs Iufusion Etanercept Treat Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) chronic , progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease involve primarily sacroiliac joint axial skeleton . The main clinical feature back pain progressive stiffness spine . Oligoarthritis hips shoulder , enthesopathy , anterior uveitis common , involvement heart lung rare . The current understanding pathogenesis disorder limited.It mainly hereditary susceptibility ( eg HLA-B27 ) , infection autoimmunity . Although traditional drug , Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs methotrexate , salicylazosulfapyridine OR thalidomide ) steroid use treatment AS , however , many study indicate overall response drug satisfy . Addition , severe side effect drug also observe . The management AS patient therefore remains unsatisfactory targeted therapy need . Although application TNF alpha receptor inhibitor ( Etanercept ) get success early treatment ankylose spondylitis , tolerance biological agent make therapy disease rather difficult . Recently , own immunoregulatory , immunosuppressive , stimulating hematopoiesis tissue repair property , infusion human MSCs isolate human bone marrow promise effective treatment AS patient . This study evaluate safety effectiveness MSC transplantation AS patient compare efficiency Etanercept treat AS patient . This study last 2 3 year . Participants randomly assign receive either MSC transplant therapy ( experimental group ) Etanercept therapy ( control group ) . Patients undergo MSC transplant start study Day 0 . The experimental group receive infusion per week first 4 week every two week second 8 week , totally 12 week . After 3 month , patient receive second MSC transplantation . After 12 week ( Phase I ) 48 week ( Phase II ) first transplantation , patient evaluate .</detailed_description>
