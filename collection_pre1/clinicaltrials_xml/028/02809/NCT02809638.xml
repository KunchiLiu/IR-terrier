	<brief_summary>In clinical practice , compression ultrasound ( CUS ) become easy reliable noninvasive tool diagnosis deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . Currently validate method assess biological age venous thrombus , date onset thrombosis . One potential technique age DVT ultrasound elastography ( UE ) . UE noninvasive technique measure tissue hardness , well know thrombus harden age . The aim study assess ability UE distinguish acute chronic DVT . The investigator evaluate prospectively consecutive outpatient present clinically suspect unprovoked DVT low limb , previous diagnosis DVT schedule 3 month visit follow-up , period one year . All enrol patient undergo CUS low limb , time ultrasound elastography physician expert vascular ultrasound . The specialist perform examination unaware time onset DVT ( acute chronic ) . Then patient divide two group ( group A : patient acute DVT ; group B : patient chronic DVT 3rd month follow-up ) . Each examination ( CUS ultrasound elastography ) repeat three time patient visit , assess reproducibility technique . The demographic data , medical history , physical examination result CUS ultrasound elastography collect case report form ( CRF ) another investigator perform examination . The blinded CRF submit dedicated committee statistical analysis .</brief_summary>
