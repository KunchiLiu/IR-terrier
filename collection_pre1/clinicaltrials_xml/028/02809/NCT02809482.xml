	<brief_summary>Peripheral tissue ( e.g . liver , adipose , muscle ) express self-sustained circadian clock coordinate daily metabolic rhythm . The timing clock rhythms peripheral tissue highly sensitive feeding-fasting signal across sleep-wake transition . Nutritional insults high fat overfeed ( HF-OF ) show attenuate clock gene expression peripheral tissue result deleterious re-programming circadian metabolome . Studies humans superficially investigated circadian clock machinery impact nutritional signal . The overall goal pilot project take first step toward develop translational method investigate link change energy flux circadian system human tissue . Using innovative ex vivo cell culture approach investigator examine impact 3-days HF-OF compare eucaloric ( EU ) feed expression core clock gene human subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT ) . The Investigators hypothesize compare EU , amplitude clock gene expression SAT measure 24hrs attenuate follow short-term HF-OF . This pilot project serve launch point design future study effect diet exercise circadian control metabolism adipose tissue depot well tissue ( e.g . muscle ) .</brief_summary>
