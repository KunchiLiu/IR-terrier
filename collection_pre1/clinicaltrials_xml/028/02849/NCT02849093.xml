	<brief_summary>The primary aim study investigate whether optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) may useful tool investigate in-vivo histology ocular structure patient tear film pathology . In epiphora investigator image proximal lacrimal system . In dry eye syndrome investigator image lacrimal gland also buccal mucosa . The secondary aim study investigate appearance normal cornea conjunctiva OCT imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) safe non-invasive method high resolution cross-sectional imaging tissue microstructures use infra-red radiation . It first describe Huang et al 1991 . The principle OCT image similar ultrasound ; infra-red light shone tissue interest reflectivity layer within tissue give rise signal enables cross-sectional picture tissue construct . In contrast ultrasound however , possible use timing reflect pulse light infer distance reflect surface . This extremely high velocity light ( 3x10^8 ms^-1 ) , would require detector temporal resolution ten femtoseconds order provide spatial resolution 10 micron within tissue observation . therefore , interferometry apply infra-red light source order determine distance reflect light travel . OCT currently wide range application include image retina , anterior chamber eye endothelium coronary artery ( use intravascularly ) . It also use preclinical cancer research image tumour . IT resolution 1-20µm penetrate approximately 1-2mm tissue . Dry Eye Syndrome : Sjögren 's common cause dry eye syndrome . Currently biopsy lacrimal gland require establish diagnosis . In study investigator explore whether possible distinguish lacrimal gland Sjögren 's patient normal lacrimal gland use OCT imaging . The investigator also image buccal mucosa suspect Sjögren 's patient compare result previously publish image normal mucosa . Epiphora : Punctal anatomy clinically relevant management epiphora punctal stenosis one many cause condition . However , currently routinely use imaging modality objective quantitative assessment system proximal lacrimal system . OCT seem ideally suit image punctum due high resolution non-invasive nature . The investigator recently complete study demonstrate feasibility OCT image proximal lacrimal system cohort subject normal ocular anatomy symptom epiphora . In study investigator examine practical clinical application OCT image pre post-operatively patient undergo punctoplasty conjunctivoplasty treat epiphora . Asymptomatic Patients : The investigator aim establish normal OCT appearance conjunctiva cornea ; also aim establish normal appearance lacrimal gland buccal mucosa .</detailed_description>
