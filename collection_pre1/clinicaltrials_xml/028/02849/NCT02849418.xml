	<criteria>Aged &gt; =20 year time signing informed consent Subject urinary incontinence result neurogenic detrusor overactivity period least 3 month prior screen result spinal cord injury multiple sclerosis , determine document subject history . In addition : 1 . Spinal cord injury subject must stable neurological injury level T1 ( cervical injury exclude ) occur &gt; =6 month prior screen . 2 . Multiple sclerosis subject must clinically stable investigator 's opinion , &gt; =3 month prior screen Expanded Disability Status Scale score &lt; =6.5 Subject NDO period least 3 month prior screen , determine documented subject history . The presence involuntary detrusor contraction ( IDC ) must also demonstrate urodynamic assessment screen period Day 1 ( prior randomization ) . Subject adequately manage one medication ( i.e. , anticholinergic beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist ) treatment urinary incontinence due NDO . Not adequately manage define : An inadequate response least 4week period medication ( ) urinary incontinence due NDO optimize dose ( ) , i.e. , subject still incontinent despite medication ( ) urinary incontinence due NDO , Limiting side effect ( i.e. , condition subject reduce dosage discontinue medication due side effect ) least 2week period medication ( ) urinary incontinence due NDO optimize dose ( ) Subject &gt; =6 episodes urinary incontinence , one urgency incontinencefree day 3day subject bladder diary complete screening phase Subject currently use willing use clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) empty bladder ( indwell catheter permit ) . Subjects currently CIC willing maintain CIC schedule least 3 time per day throughout study . Caregiver may perform CIC . Body weight &gt; =40 kilogram ( kg ) screening Males females： 1 . Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication study exit : Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . Male condom plus partner use one follow contraceptive option : Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet standard operate procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception 2 . Female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : • Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . • Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication study exit . This list highly effective method ( approve Japan ) provide , apply FRP sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis : Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ; Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Subject give sign informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol ( e.g. , complete bladder diary questionnaires , able collect volume void per micturition measurement 24hour period , attend study visit opinion investigator ( subinvestigator ) . Subject history evidence disease , functional abnormality bladder surgery , NDO , may affect bladder function include limited : 1 . Bladder stone ( include bladder stone surgery ) within 6 month prior screen confirm occurrence bladder stone screen phase 2 . Surgery ( include minimally invasive surgery ) within 1 year screen stress incontinence pelvic organ prolapse 3 . Current use electrostimulation/neuromodulation device treatment urinary incontinence . Note : Use implantable device prohibit within 4 week prior initiation Screening phase throughout study period . Use external device discontinue least 7 day prior start screen phase 4 . Current use baclofen pump 5 . History interstitial cystitis , opinion investigator ( subinvestigator ) 6 . Past current evidence hematuria due urological/renal pathology uninvestigated hematuria . Subjects investigate hematuria may enter study urological/renal pathology rule satisfaction investigator ( subinvestigator ) 7 . Past current history bladder cancer urothelial malignancy , positive result urine cytology uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology result Screening phase . Suspicious urine cytology abnormality require bladder cancer urothelial malignancy rule satisfaction investigator accord local site practice . 8 .

Chronic stable hepatitis B C ( example , presence hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] positive hepatitis C antibody [ HCVAb ] test result within 3 month prior first dose study treatment ) acceptable subject otherwise meet entry criterion QTc &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block result ECG screening . Notes : 1 . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , and/or another method , machineread manually overread 2 . The specific formula use determine eligibility discontinuation individual subject determine prior initiation study . In word , several different formula use calculate QTc individual subject low QTc value use include discontinue subject trial Subject hemophilia clot factor deficiency disorder cause bleed diathesis Subject change initiate discontinues anticholinergic , beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist medication therapy treat urinary incontinence due NDO , within 6 day prior start screen phase Subject treat intravesical pharmacologic agent ( e.g. , capsaicin , resiniferatoxin ) urinary incontinence due NDO within 12 month prior initiation Treatment phase 1 ( Week 0 ) Subject previous current use botulinum toxin therapy serotype treatment urological condition Subject previous use within 12 week prior initiation Treatment phase 1 ( Week 0 ) current use botulinum toxin therapy serotype nonurological condition beauty care Subject immunize botulinum toxin serotype Subject withhold antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy medication anticoagulative effect 3 day prior initiation Treatment phase 1 ( Week 0 ) . Some medication may need withhold &gt; 3 day , per clinical judgment investigator ( subinvestigator ) . Subject without urinary tract infection ( UTI ) determine urinalysis urine culture and/or investigator opinion , initiate prophylactic antibiotic medication 1 3 day prior initiation Treatment phase 1 ( Week 0 ) .
