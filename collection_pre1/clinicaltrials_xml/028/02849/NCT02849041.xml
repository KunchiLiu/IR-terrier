	<brief_summary>Tobacco smoke common source exposure carcinogens human . Indeed , smoke contains 1010 particle per ml 4800 chemical compound , least 66 carcinogenic . Tobacco smoke lead preventable cause cancer human since responsible lung cancer , upper aerodigestive tract ( mouth , pharynx , larynx , esophagus ) , nasal cavity sinus , stomach , pancreas , liver , bladder , kidney , uterine cervix , myeloid leukemia . This study aim evaluate combine effect scanner search circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) screen tobacco-related cancer , accompany smoker cessation address psychological impact approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : The study take two line research : 1 - Imaging Research circulate tumor cell : The main objective evaluate diagnostic value couple scanner low intensity speed search circulate tumor cell ( CTC-LDCT ) screen population high risk lung cancer . The secondary objective : 1 . / compare added diagnostic value dual-CTC LDCT screen screen LDCT use alone use NLST study lung cancer screening ; 2 . / assess interest ass diagnostic value research circulate tumor cell identify extrapulmonary cancer associate smoking ; 3 / evaluate psychological effect screen ( see psychological study ) . 2 - Psychological Study The main objective study emotional psychosocial consequence LDCT screen specific context circulate tumor cell . This identify 1 / specific mechanism fear , anxiety mental distress , 2 / adaptation strategy could beneficial patient , 3 / specific stressor cause device screen / medical information give patient . The secondary objective adjust improve communication skill health professional order develop appropriate framework support emotional psychological aspect involve screen process ( ) use daily clinical practice . Study Design 1 . - Imaging Research circulate tumor cell This prospective cohort study , multicenter ( hospital attach University Paris Descartes ) , open , non-randomized , single arm . Each subject enrol study undergo three screening procedure . Patients cancer prevalent first exam offer treatment balance sheet . Only subject cancer first examination return actual screening study search incident case . The sequence evaluation repeat year 2 year . 2 . - Psychological Study To achieve objective , qualitative study base ground theory ( `` ground theory '' ) build . Grounded theory research methodology study psychosocial process make model theoretically . Since method involve small sample subject , promote flexibility data collection detail analysis case study .</detailed_description>
