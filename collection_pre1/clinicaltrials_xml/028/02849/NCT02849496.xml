	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well veliparib atezolizumab work either alone combination treat patient stage III-IV triple negative breast cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , atezolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It know whether give veliparib atezolizumab either alone combination would work good patient triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib Atezolizumab Either Alone Combination Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) veliparib combination atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A ) advance triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) harbor homologous deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair ( HDR ) breast cancer gene ( BRCA ) 1/2 mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate ( ORR ) veliparib ( ABT-888 ) combination MPDL3280A advance TNBC harbor HDR BRCA 1/2 mutation . II . Determine duration response ( DoR ) ABT-888 combination MPDL3280A advance TNBC harbor HDR BRCA 1/2 mutation . III . Determine change extent mutational burden BRCA 1/2 mutate tumor baseline progression . IV . Evaluate characterize change extent program cell death ligand-1 ( PD-L1 ) expression tumor immune infiltrates . V. Retrospectively evaluate tumor limit immune infiltrate ( e.g . `` non-inflamed '' ) determine poly ( adenosine diphosphate ) ribose polymerase inhibitor ( PARPi ) increase immune infiltration . VI . Determine immune-related best overall response ( irBOR ) ABT-888 combination MPDL3280A advance TNBC harbor HDR BRCA 1/2 mutation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate change candidate neoantigen profile immune/inflammation signatures use DNA ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) -sequencing serial tumor biopsy . II . Evaluate characterize immune parameter peripheral blood/ peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . III . Test hypothesis DNA repair status affect tumor-immune interaction . IV . Characterize mechanism action PARP inhibitor ABT-888 ( veliparib ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-21 atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
