	<brief_summary>Introdution : The Kangaroo Mother Care perinatal care model preterm low weight newborn . The Kangaroo Position main feature method . The infant lightly dress , prone position upright torax parent . Researches provide evidence Kangaroo Position induces increase myoelectric activity preterm newborn . However , unknown long newborn remain kangaroo Position ocurr change electromyographic . An increase electromyographic activity observe 24 hour submission Position Kangaroo , however period low submission Position Kangaroo evaluate yet . Also unknown physiological mechanism cause muscle response . One hypothesis would increase temperature cause skin skin contact could improve circulation small vessel direct influence infusion nutrition muscle tissue . Objective : Evaluate immediate effect Kangaroo position electromyographic activity microcirculation preterm newborn . Method : It randomize control trial August 2016 February 2017 newborn preterm admit Kangaroo Unit , IMIP . Newborns eligible accord inclusion exclusion criterion randomize two group : Kangaroo Group ( experimental group ) Not Kangaroo Group ( control group ) . The data electromyographic activity microcirculatory parameter assess record three stage : Kangaroo position , one three hour continuous submission Kangaroo Position ( group case ) Kangaroo position , one four three assessment ( control group ) . In control group , preterm newborn submit Kangaroo position completion last third evaluation . The acquisition electromyographic signal conduct equipment electromyography Miotool 400® brand ( Miotec Equipamentos Biomédicos - Brasil ) . To assess microcirculation use white light spectroscopy method drive moorVMS-OXY® . The project submit approve Ethics Committee Research Human Beings IMIP ( 52381915.5.0000.5201 ) . This study part anchor project approve Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico- CNPq ( process 458163/2014-7 ) .</brief_summary>
