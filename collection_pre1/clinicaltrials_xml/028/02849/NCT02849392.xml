	<detailed_description>Primary Research Objectives : 1 . To examine effect diet rich pistachio body composition 2 . Examine incorporation healthy fat red blood cell ( RBC ) membranes 3 . Determine change blood lipid , inflammatory marker marker bone turnover pistachio consumption 4 . Assess diet quality/micronutrient quality satiety pistachio consumption Methods Investigators employ crossover design two 12-week treatment period ( pistachio add no-pistachio control diet ) , separate 15-week washout period , 30 healthy student campus . Subjects Female student enrol CP-SLO CP-P invite participate study . The first 30 qualified female enrol study site . A screening questionnaire determine eligibility . The interview take ~5 minute . This sample size provide adequate power ( 80 % ) detect individual change . Recruitment Female student enrol CP-SLO CP-P invite participate study . Potential subject notify flyer , email , add marquee , peer recruitment summer school class . The information flyer email approve Institutional Review Boards contain information regard inclusion/exclusion criterion , length study , risk benefit . Participants ask contact either Dr. Laura Hall ( CP-SLO ) Dr. Bonny Burns-Whitmore ( CP-P ) potential participant ask fill screen questionnaire determine eligibility . Study Design &amp; Methods We employ randomize crossover design two 12-week treatment period : pistachio add ( 20 % kcals ) no-pistachio control diet ) , separate 15-week washout period , 30 healthy female student campus . The first treatment period Fall 2012 second treatment period Spring 2013 . Randomization treatment ( pistachio ) habitual ( control ) diet 24-hour recall Randomization do utilize www.randomization.com list random appointment either treatment group first control group first . Materials Procedures : Study visit : Participants come CP-SLO ( n=30 ) CP-P ( n=30 ) site week Fall quarter 12 week Spring quarter 12 week pick pre-measured pistachio total 24 total study visit . At initial visit , half participant give pistachio include diet snack meal ( 20 percent kcals ; intervention group ) half continue normal diet ( control group ) . During , Spring , half participant switch consume pistachio first half . Diet counsel also give visit compliance study protocol evaluate count number pistachio package look participant 's Unusual Diet Diary . At baseline end treatment period , participant height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , body composition measure blood drawn site . At CP-SLO also bone density measure ( DXA ) . At CP-P site fatty acid analysis perform examine monounsaturated fatty acid incorporation red blood cell ( RBCs ) . Calculation/Distribution Pistachios Initial/Weekly Study Visits During lead-in period participant meet initially train keep food record Registered Dietitian ( RD ) . During week keep 3-day food record turn immediately . The researcher calculate many pistachio participant need base initial 3-day food record . This amount substitute 20 percent usual caloric need pre-measured daily individually-wrapped serving . The research meet participant weekly give week 's supply pre-measured packet pistachio ( one day ) . They ask bring use wrapper weekly counseling meeting . At weekly counseling meeting , participant show incorporate pistachio diet ( either snack recipe ) isocaloric diet , check participant 's unusual diet diary food record accuracy , review 'MyPlate ' guideline check empty pistachio wrapper compliance . Participants also get email/text reminder meeting reminder instruction prepare study visit . Data Collected sit Fall 2012 ( wk 1 wk 12 ) &amp; Spring 2013 ( wk 1 wk 12 ) : Anthropometric Measurements : Body weight measure use calibrate scale record nearest 0.1 kg . Height measure use stadiometer record near 0.1 cm . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight ( kg ) divide height ( ) square . Waist circumference measure use flexible measuring tape middle bottom rib iliac crest ( top hip bone ) record near 0.1 cm . Hip circumference measure use flexible measuring tape around large part hip ( i.e . buttock ) record near 0.1 cm . Measurements take twice average . We also calculate waist-to-hip ratio . Protocols base NHANES III standardize procedure student volunteer thoroughly trained protocol ( see link-NHANES ) Blood Pressure : Blood pressure take use automatic blood pressure monitor . Protocol base Mayo Clinic standardize procedure student volunteer thoroughly trained protocol ( see link-Mayo Clinic ) . Body Composition Measurement : Body fat percentage assess bioelectrical impedance analysis use Tanita Body Composition Analyzer Scale ( model TBF-310 ) ; Tanita Corporation , ( Tokyo , Japan ) . It also use measure weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , percent body fat , impedance , fat mass ( TBF ) , fat free mass ( FFM ) , total body mass ( TBM ) , total body water ( TBW ) . The participant need fast 12 hour study visit ( i.e . caffeine morning 1.5 cup water prior visit encourage ) . Food Records/Unusual Diet Diary ( ie . Dietary Adherence &amp; Compliance ) : Adherence compliance assign diet assess use Unusual Diet Diary ( develop CP-P ) , fill participant unusual quantity food accidental pistachio consumption occur , medical treatment require , suspect allergic reaction/side effect occur pharmaceutical consume . If participant experience allergic reaction pistachio tell call 911 contacting researcher , remove study limit risk . Food record administer treatment obtain information regard subject 's diet determine subject adhere treatment protocol . Participants thoroughly trained keep accurate food record . Participants ask perform 9 randomly select food record throughout study . Investigators use Nutrition Data System Research ( NDSR ) University Minnesota campuses diet analysis software ( see NDSR link ) . Satiety Hunger rating : Participants rate hunger use rating scale ( 1-10 ) , snack meal directly 9 require food record treatment , use validate visual analog scale ( VAS ) rate hunger consume snack meal pistachio intervention group randomly choose snacks/meals control group . Participants give binder food record form VAS questionnaire randomly choose date instruction list . Completed form check accuracy collect weekly visit binder . Physical Activity Questionnaire : Participants ask recall physical activity level precede week ( 7 day recall ) use 2002 International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) short form . Participants encourage maintain usual level physical activity . Chem Panel/Iron Panel/Blood Lipids : Blood drawn campus Health Center week 1 12 examine lipid panel , standard chem . panel iron status . The participant need fast 12 hour blood draw , however , consume 1.5 cup water morning encourage . Inflammatory Markers : Blood drawn campus Health Center week 1 12 examine inflammatory marker ( ie , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFa ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) ) . The participant need fast 12 hour blood draw , however , consume 1.5 cup water morning encourage . Markers Bone Turnover : Blood drawn campus Health Center week 1 12 examine marker bone turnover . Data Collected Cal Poly , SLO site : Body Composition/Bone Mineral Density ( DXA ) : Full-body DXA ( iDXA , General Electric Healthcare ) use determine body fat mass , body fat percentage , lean body mass bone mineral density subject . A pregnancy test give participant test ensure safety fetus . If positive , participant ask terminate participation study . Data Collected Cal Poly , Pomona site : Erythrocyte Membrane Incorporation ( Lipomics ) : Erythrocytes membrane measure fatty acid . Erythrocytes pack dry ice ship overnight Lipomics Technologies , West Sacramento , California 95691 . Data Analysis : A statistician consult statistical analysis conduct use Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS version 9.2 ) . Time-repeated analysis variance ( ANOVA ) perform comparison variable two time point ANOVA 's performed two treatment group . Spearman 's correlation use examine association variable . Debriefing Participants : Subjects consent study aware purpose study . All subject give copy consent form . Results Dissemination Plan The dissemination plan result project include limited : - Publication peer-reviewed journal ( i.e . Journal Nutrition , The Journal Clinical Nutrition , The Journal Academy Nutrition Dietetics ( AND ) , American Journal Public Health , Journal Family Consumer Science ) . - Publication newsletter article research bulletin - Publication Cal Poly Pomona web site , Agriscapes , e-mail announcement , presentation poster session - Presentation scientific meeting ( i.e . Experimental Biology ) .</detailed_description>
