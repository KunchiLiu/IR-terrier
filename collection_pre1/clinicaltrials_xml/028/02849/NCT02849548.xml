	<brief_title>Suvorexant Sleep 's Benefits Therapeutic Exposure Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) include exposure trauma memory consider first line treatment PTSD . However , approximately 1/3 patient complete CBT PTSD achieve remission , hyperarousal symptom include sleep disturbance less responsive CBT PTSD symptom . Despite limitation , CBT outcomes generally superior outcome pharmacotherapy . It , therefore , imperative identify strategy improve effectiveness treatment PTSD , particularly hyperarousal symptom . Disturbed sleep common PTSD . Studies PTSD anxiety mood disorder show impaired sleep psychotherapy predict less favorable response . Sleep implicate learn process key adaptive processing trauma memory extinction learn generalization extinction . Our recent PTSD study show preserve slow-wave sleep ( SWS ) , less increase rapid-eye-movement ( REM ) density , reduce wake sleep onset ( WASO ) sleep follow even session write narrative exposure ( WNE : write one 's traumatic experience ) associate great PTSD symptom reduction . These finding suggest increase nocturnal arousal compromise sleep 's benefit emotional processing trauma memory . Identifying strategy reduce nocturnal arousal promote sleep characteristic associate emotional adaptation could enhance PTSD treatment outcome . Orexins neuropeptides implicated regulate sleep/wakefulness emotional behavior , include anxiety . Inhibiting orexin system promote slow-wave pattern reduce wake animal model . The first orexin receptor antagonist ( suvorexant ) recently approve treatment insomnia . Suvorexant reduce WASO latency persistent sleep increase SWS REM sleep human insomnia . In addition , administration orexin-A increased anxiety-like behavior rodent , administration orexin receptor-1 antagonist mouse facilitate extinction condition fear , animal model recovery PTSD anxiety disorder . Objective : To examine effect block orexin system suvorexant WNE sleep , PTSD symptom , intersession habituation . The investigator utilize WNE paradigm participant PTSD write traumatic experience even morning session intervene sleep . Suvorexant placebo administer even WNE , sleep record . The investigator hypothesize 1 ) Suvorexant promote sleep characteristic associate favorable treatment outcomes emotional adaptation ( e.g. , increased SWS REM sleep , reduce WASO ) compare placebo ; 2 ) Participants give suvorexant great PTSD symptom reduction intersession habituation indexed reduction maximum pulse rate compare participant give placebo ; 3 ) The great PTSD symptom reduction intersession habituation suvorexant group account effect medication sleep .</detailed_description>
