Females sexually active able conceive exclude currently use agree continue use duration study effective method contraception determine investigator 2 . Females pregnant intend become pregnant participation trial • Females capable childbearing must negative pregnancy test time screen visit pregnancy test must repeat enrollment do &gt; 14 day prior 3 . Presence condition opinion investigator impair participant 's ability use system ( e.g. , visual impairment interferes ability read display ) 4 . Unable unwilling use study device follow study procedure include meal exercise/ activity challenge CRC . 5 . A current condition would prevent use study device , include blood glucose meter ( BGM ) , continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) insulin pump ( CSII ) 6 . Current participation within last 60 day another clinical research study involve intervention • Participation research study involve data collection exclusion ( e.g. , T1D Exchange Registry ) 7 . Anticoagulant therapy aspirin 8 . Severe hypoglycemia result seizure OR loss consciousness within 30 day prior enrollment 9 . Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) require treatment healthcare facility within 30 day prior enrollment 10 . Current use ( define within last 3 month ) medication intend low glucose insulin ( e.g. , use Metformin , Liraglutide , would exclusion ) 11 . Current use ( define within last 3 month ) medication accord dose , frequency , route administration may result hyperglycemia investigator 's judgment ( e.g. , current use oral steroid ) • Regular use inhale intranasal steroid permit 12 . Presence significant renal disease evidence presence following : Current dialysis therapy Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL within 30 day enrollment For screen purpose , serum creatinine level test participant meet follow criterion : A≥10 year history T1D Are ≥ 45 year age 13 . Presence history clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , pacemaker , acute coronary syndrome , therapeutic coronary intervention , coronary bypass stenting procedure , atrial ventricular fibrillation , treatment arrhythmia , stable unstable angina , episode chest pain cardiac etiology associate ECG change positive stress test/ cardiac catheterization , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular event ) 14 . ECG finding indicate participation plan exercise/ activity session would contraindicate determined trained personnel respective clinical center ( ) • For screen purpose , ECGs must complete within 30 day enrollment participant meet follow criterion : A ≥ 10 year history T1D ≥ 20 year age Are ≥ 45 year age 15 .
