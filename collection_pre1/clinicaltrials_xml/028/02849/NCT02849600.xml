	<brief_title>Retrospective Cohort Study Vital Pulp Therapy Young Permanent Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike fully develop teeth , root canal treatment young permanent teeth particularly complex difficult due large apical opening , short root length thin canal wall . In modern endodontics , vital pulp therapy ( VPT ) , biological base procedure design restore functional pulp-dentin complex promote continue root development , consider alternative treatment modality . Mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( MTA ) recommend us VPT preliminary study , show promising result . However , lack high level evidence trial , inconsistent treatment protocols follow-up period , heterogeneous selection criterion , result VPT unreliable difficult reach consensus efficacy MTA . Therefore , propose retrospective cohort study two specific aim . The first aim focus treatment outcome different VPT protocol young permanent tooth . The second aim determine MTA suitable material VPT related factor potentially influence prognosis . Subjects study identified patient receive VPT Department Dentistry National Taiwan University Hospital 1999 2014 return tooth follow least one year treatment . Treatment outcomes judge analyze clinical radiographic data , evaluate 3 independent dentist . The radiograph evaluate use geometrical image program-NIH Image J , calculate percentage increase root length width . Statistical analysis apply use SPSS program ass treatment 's success rate various follow-up period . The difference statistically analyze perform chi-square test , Fisher exact test , t-test , use statistical significance p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects ASA I health person 2 .
