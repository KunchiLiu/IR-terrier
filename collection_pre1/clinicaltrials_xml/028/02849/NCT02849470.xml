	<brief_title>AGA Biocellular Stem/Stromal Hair Regenerative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : The cosmetic discipline hair restoration root numerous landmark study progressive medical science medical literature . , , , , With advent advance theory science within scope regenerative medicine , numerous report note literature . , , , , , use biological modality , e.g. , HD-PRP concentrate define &gt; 4-6 time patient circulate baseline , stimulation scalp tissue hair follicle androgenetic alopecic ( AGA ) . Design study intend prospective , randomize , multicenter trial blind outcome independent observer , clinical provider patient observation/satisfaction study . The study propose adipose-derived ( AD ) biocellular material mixed platelet high density concentrate ( HD-PRP ) offer potential advantage markedly effective therapeutic profile area follicular miniaturization , tissue age relate senescence , effect decrease vascular capability stimulation vasculoneogenesis . The benefit use autologous adipose-derived stem/stromal cell ( ADSCs ) population cell proliferation vasculogenesis intrinsically link native immunomodulatory capacity . Reports describe safety efficacy biocellular combination report peer review literature . , In second third arm study , use regenerative protocol currently utilized treatment degenerative musculoskeletal condition employ . These protocol feature use emulsify AD-tSVF emulsify cell enrich AD-cSVF contain full heterogeneous stem/stromal cell population matrix inject region scalp contain microenvironment ( niche ) hair follicle . In Arm 3 , cellular enrichment emulsify AD-tSVF accomplished via semi-automated , close sterile system ( Healeon CentriCyte 1000 system ) isolate concentrate AD-cSVF . The AD-cSVF mixed high-density platelet rich plasma ( HD-PRP ) concentrate emulsified AD-tSVF tissue ( AD-tSVF ) prior scalp injection . This injected cell-enriched product contains native adipose tissue scaffolding , autologous HD-PRP , enrich adipose stem/stromal cell-enriched concentration stromal/stem cell ( AD-cSVF ) . The goal study demonstrate safety efficacy HD-PRP + AD-tSVF + AD-cSVF biocellular injection scalp men woman diagnosis non-scaring alopecia , full reporting AE SAE ( adverse event ) . The biocellular material inject 3-5 mm depth within mid-reticular dermis upper subcutaneous fat layer scalp purpose regenerate miniaturize hair follicle , deliver milieu stromal/stem cell facilitate regenerative change within tissue site . In addition provide tissue scaffolding , great number stromal/stem cell tissue surround follicular niche , novel use emulsification AD tissue cell-enriched biocellular material permit ergonomic facilitation layer injection pattern scalp small gauge ( 25-27 gauge ) needle This emulsified AD Biocellular methodology reduces injection pressure requirement use small gauge needle . When clinically compare use much large needle require inject non-emulsified AD-tSVF , improvement current technique . Successful stem/stromal cell-enrichment AD-tSVF HD PRP biocellular mixture report numerous peer-reviewed publish clinical experience injection structural tissue augmentation plastic surgery , chronic wound therapy , ultrasound guide musculoskeletal treatment orthopedic surgery . A `` retrograde '' fill technique create potential space subsequently inject space biocellular material needle withdrawn advance study . All patient undergo venipuncture obtain HD-PRP concentrate follow FDA approve Emcyte II manufacturer 's guideline . Those patient biocellular treatment also undergo small volume close syringe microcannula lipoaspiration acquire AD-tSVF tissue , emulsify via Healeon ACM System per manufacturer 's guideline . Cellular test sample Arm 2 Arm 3 perform flow cytometry ( ORFLO , MoxiFlow , Ketchum , ID , USA ) viability cell concentration . The trial include biocellular mixture HD-PRP + emulsify AD-tSVF ( Arm 2 ) and/or , HD-PRP + emulsify AD-tSVF + AD-cSVF ( Arm 3 ) . Study utilize standardize high-density PRP concentration system patient volume . The definition HD-PRP concentrate minimum =/ &gt; 4 time patient circulate platelet count . A detailed patient medical history , informed consent , screen evaluation determine eligibility candidacy study . Each patient undergo small volume lipoaspiration ( define &lt; 100 cc ) local anesthesia , without , oral sedation . Candidates assign one three treatment ARMs . The treatment ARMS : ARM 1 : HD-PRP + Matristem Matrix ( A-Cell ) ( control ) ; ARM 2 : HD-PRP + emulsify AD-tSVF ; , ARM 3 : HD-PRP + emulsify AD-tSVF + cell-enriched AD-cSVF . All patient receive standard ring block local anesthesia scalp treatment area , follow retrograde injection pattern biocellular material . Recording platelet baseline treatment concentrate , flow cytometric examination cell viability , cell count AD-cSVF complete patient . Biocellular injection treatment give two ( 2 ) separate procedure three ( 3 ) month apart . Follow clinical examination perform 6 month 1year period completion outcome analyse include independent observer , clinician , subject satisfaction . The volume HD-PRP concentrate standardized volume trial ARMs . Immediate reporting study group AR SAR document record safety record directly Ken Williams , DO , Principal Clinical Investigator . This Clinical Trial sample size 60 patient six ( 6 ) center utilize protocol , equipment reporting requirement .</detailed_description>
