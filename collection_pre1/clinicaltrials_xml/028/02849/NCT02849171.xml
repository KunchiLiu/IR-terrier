	<brief_summary>This pilot study . The purpose study test image tracer , approve FDA , call 18F-Fluorocholine ( 18F-FCH ) useful evaluate type cancer . This tracer use perform PET scan . The researcher want see 18F-FCH PET scan , use study tracer 18F-FCH , improve upon usual scan diagnose monitoring type cancer . In patient high-grade glioma , change standard MRI brain may reflect true tumor growth inflammatory change response treatment , call pseudo-progression . It important distinguish true tumor growth inflammation since inflammation indicate tumor respond treatment . With standard MRI , difficult determine change follow treatment due tumor growth inflammation early . Researchers hope learn investigational tracer , 18F-FCH , able distinguish true tumor growth inflammation accurately standard MRI 18F-FDG PET scan .</brief_summary>
