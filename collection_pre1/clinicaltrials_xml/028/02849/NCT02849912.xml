	<brief_summary>Non Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) 5th cancer France . Advances NHL therapy result improved cure rate 5 year relative survival rate estimate 55 % 5-year prevalence estimate 27,750 case . Since 2000 , addition anti-CD20 antibody standard treatment regimen compose cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ( CHOP ) lead first time decline specific mortality . After treatment , patient NHL experience elevated risk therapy-related leukemia , several solid tumor late toxicity cardiovascular neuro-psychiatric disease impact quality life . However little known concern long-term toxicity class new agent call `` target drug '' anti-CD20 . The primary objective cohort study estimate long term toxicity NHL patient ( i.e . 10 20 year ) use data already collect ( i.e . internal analysis ) compare drug consumption control ( i.e . external analysis ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The French public healthcare system perspective develop unique SNIIR-AM ( interregimens National Information Health Insurance system . ) data base contain 18 TeraOctet medical consumption data ( consultation , exam drug prescription hospitalization , yes/no ) . Its main limitation detect disproportionate consumption cancer care lack data available socio-demographic , pre-diagnostic patient disease characteristic . The LYSA ( Lymphoma Study Association ) national cooperative group world pioneer NHL treatment novel agent . Patient 's bio clinical demographic characteristic ( n=10.000 ) fully monitor stock data base register 2006 French National Cancer Institute ( INCA ) . The cooperative network 100 LYSA centre allow follow patient long term ( 20 year diagnosis ) . Then , mixture two source data offer unique material nation scale detect signal late onset disease , possibly link initial cancer treatment . Statistical Methods Disproportionate reporting drug consumption field neuro-psychiatric trouble , cardio-vascular disease , anti-cancer agent , antibiotic antiviral agent extract French public healthcare database ( external analysis ) . An economical study embed . As LYSA data contain fully monitor patient ' bio clinical demographic characteristic , special attention pay addition new agent , particular anti-CD20 antibody , cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens conjunction well-known risk factor ( e.g . tobacco , obesity , comorbidities ; internal analysis ) . Data report accord initial NHL treatment strategy cross-validated long-term medical consultation . Multivariate analysis compute account compete risk . Results No study yet publish France use care issue long remission cure cancer . There international publication subject lack statistical power follow . The present project follow recommendation French Medicine Academy March 15 , 2011 decision call rigorous follow new agent Oncology . In addition , project concordance name `` plan cancer 2 '' INCA aim focus sequel cancer survivor . If result study relevant , investigator run consumption care , good objective ( unbiased ) indicator heal Health-related quality life ( HRQL ) cancer survivor . Such indicator could help learn survivor recovery cancer , without difference accord patient characteristic , initial location cancer , treatment possible iatrogenic complication .</detailed_description>
