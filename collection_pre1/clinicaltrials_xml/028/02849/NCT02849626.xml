	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , single-arm study child ( age 4 less 12 year ) inadequately control POS PGTC . The study consist Core Study Extension Phase . The Core Study consist follow 2 phase : Pretreatment Treatment Phase . The Pretreatment Phase , participant assess eligibility , consist 4-week Screening/Baseline Period . The Treatment Phase consist 3 period : 11-week Titration Period ( dose titration basis individual clinical response tolerability ) , 12-week Maintenance Period ( continuation perampanel oral suspension daily dose level achieved end Titration Period ) , 4-week Follow-up Period ( participant roll Extension Phase ) . The Extension Phase consist 29-week Maintenance Period 4-week Follow-up Period . All participant complete schedule visit include Visit 9 Treatment Phase eligible participate Extension Phase study . During Maintenance Period Extension Phase , participant continue optimal perampanel dose ( i.e. , dose level complete Core Study ) . Participants continue Extension Phase prematurely discontinue study enter 4-week Follow-up Period .</detailed_description>
