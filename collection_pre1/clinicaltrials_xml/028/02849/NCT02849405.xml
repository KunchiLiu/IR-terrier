	<brief_summary>Arteriosclerosis degenerative dysmetabolic disease arterial wall . It known principal cause coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Arteriosclerosis impact entire vascularization include microvascularization . The retina nervous tissue support microvascularization . Therefore , systemic disease affect nervous cardiovascular system susceptible manifestation retina . Retinal sign associate risk develop CAD ( qualitative appreciation ; diameter appearance arteriole ) suggest . A quantitative approach would strengthen interpretation evaluation . The Metabolic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera ( MHRC ) - experimental instrument - capacity identify quantify variety biomolecules specific retina optic nerve . The purpose pilot study determine MHRC capacity detect specific hyperspectral signature retinal arteriole subject suffer arteriosclerosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Capacity Camera Identify Signs Arteriosclerosis Retinal Arterioles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , main goal evaluate capacity Metabolic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera ( MHRC ) - experimental instrument - identify presence specific hyperspectral signature retinal arteriole subject suffer arteriosclerosis signature present retinal arteriole control subject consider healthy without arteriosclerosis risk factor . The study open , non-controlled without randomization placebo . 30 subject group enrol study total 60 subject . Recruitment take place Montreal Heart Institute ( Montreal , Quebec , Canada ) lead research team Principal Investigator . Specific inclusion/exclusion criterion differentiate subject group . Once subject fitting inclusion/exclusion criterion identify , enrol ask sign inform consent form approve Research Ethics New Technology Development Committee ( Montreal Heart Institute ) . Following step , ophthalmic examination perform . During examination , eyes evaluate order detect presence eye pathology ( advanced cataract , venous occlusion , age-related macular degeneration glaucoma ) could interfere analysis MHRC optical imaging result . The ophthalmic examination consist first slit-lamp evaluation secondly optic coherence tomography ( OCT ) plus color image fundus ( standard instrument commonly use ophthalmology clinic ) follow instillation eye drop dilate pupil . The whole examination last 45 minute ( take 15 20 minute pupil sufficiently dilate carry examination ) . If ophthalmic examination reveal exclusion criterion , next minute , subject ask undergo baseline MHRC examination . This baseline image session last maximum 15 minute . All data accord light signal spectrum analyze subsequently . Only depersonalized data , identify solely subject number , use investigator . Risks associate subject 's participation research project evaluate . Pupil dilation necessary obtain quality image retina use conventional imaging technique ( OCT fundus ) MHRC . The subject 's pupil remain dilated 4 6 hour afterward , may cause significant glare area light strong.. The MHRC research instrument image retina non-invasively Health Canada authorization obtain use context study . The foreseeable harm connect use discomfort connect injection light eye . The power monochromatic light source calculate well recommended exposure limits.. Very rigorous verification make accord parameter fix `` American National Standard safe use laser '' ( ANSI 136.1 ) laser radiation exposure . Finally , conflict interested declare protocol inform consent form . Measures place mitigate order maintain research data analysis integrity .</detailed_description>
