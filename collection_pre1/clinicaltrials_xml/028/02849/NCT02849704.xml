	<detailed_description>Reduced exocrine pancreatic function pancreatic insufficiency ( RPF/PI ) contribute poor clinical outcome number disease condition . The incidence , mechanism substantial adverse clinical outcome pancreatic insufficiency ( PI ) well know patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , life sustain role pancreatic enzyme medication CF care well establish . Much less known incidence impact RPF/PI patient chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) . Reliable non-invasive screening diagnostic test acceptable patient burden available RPF/PI . This cohort study subject CP evaluate pancreatic enzyme medication ( Creon36™ ) administration . A cohort healthy subject serve comparison group evaluate . Subjects CP receive Creon36™ , pancreatic enzyme medication , fat energy absorption evaluate use three method : MBT , CFA , BC administration Creon36™ . Many patient CP risk RPF/PI yet rarely undergo diagnostic testing . Pancreatic enzyme medication likely improve clinical outcome quality life RPF/PI . A cohort healthy volunteer evaluate three method provide essential comparison data optimize understanding interpretation finding three method RPF/PI cohort CP . There intervention healthy cohort .</detailed_description>
