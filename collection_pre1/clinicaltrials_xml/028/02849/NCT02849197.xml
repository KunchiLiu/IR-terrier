	<detailed_description>Pilonidal sinus disease ( PSD ) common chronic disease generally affect young adult age 45 . It commonly observe inter-gluteal region , though may also affect site like umbilicus inter-digital area , particularly among barber . The disease long think either congenital acquire ; although recent year widely view acquired disease . The etiology PSD fully understand , however , important cause believe fall hair accumulate within skin fold implant within skin . The skin become prone maceration , sweat bacterial contamination , facilitate implantation fall hair , create necessary condition development disease . Although PSD benign disease , produce symptom pain discharge , adversely affect patient quality life . There many approach treatment disease , include several surgical method limit large excision , primary closure , flap technique , many non-surgical method . However , consensus reach regard ideal treatment method . An ideal surgical treatment reduces recurrence complication rate , allow minimal hospitalization rapid return daily activity . Among patient treat use limited excision primary closure method , presence natal cleft associate high morbidity , result recurrence rate 7-42 % . For technique use flap approach , rate decrease 0-3 % . In patient undergo Rhomboid excision Limberg flap technique , require large surgical area compare limited excision primary closure method , complication rate low , length hospital-stay time return work reduce . However , use classical Limberg flap technique , maceration scar formation due suture inter-gluteal sulcus , accumulation hair midline may result recurrence . Application modify Limberg technique include lateralization middle line help reduce wound complication recurrence rate . Several publication report contradict result regard surgical outcome use technique , may attributable difference practice surgeon . Therefore , logical explore superiority type surgical technique perform surgeon surgical treatment pilonidal sinus disease .</detailed_description>
