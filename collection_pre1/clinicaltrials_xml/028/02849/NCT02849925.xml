	<detailed_description>Background problem statement . Traditionally , caries treatment base restorative procedure perform dentist use dental biomaterials . Besides high cost , canonical approach caries therapy limited coverage small proportion population satisfy high demand . The latter especially critical develop country . Available evidence show caries lesion , either cavitated non-cavitated , may treat placement sealant . This minimally invasive treatment cost-effective restorative approach allow good coverage . Sealants place active lesion hamper lesion progression , likely inhibit nutrient uptake invading associate microbiota . The commonly use material clinical practice resin sealant . Despite advantage simplicity use , material highly sensitive contamination saliva ubiquitous oral fluid . Furthermore , adhesion enamel compromise tissue immature . This pitfall technique particularly crucial come treat lesion erupt molar child . Hence , glass ionomer cement ( GI ) sealant emerge potential alternative resin sealant . GI sealant suitable use non-ideal clinical condition , presence humidity lesion immature erupt molar . Although exists vast evidence use sealant preventive agent , study deal biomaterial therapeutic agent caries lesion limit scarce . In regard material , clinical study unclear conclusion available . This proposal , therefore , seek compare progression caries lesion treat either resin GI sealant , occlusal cavitated lesion ( Code 3 , ICDAS ) permanent molars 6 12 year-old child . Methodology . A randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) propose . Once approve Bioethics Committee obtain sign informed consent parent , volunteer child invite participate . Two hundred caries lesion ( Code 3 , ICDAS ) randomize one two arm study , resin GI sealant . The material choose conduct study would Concise Ketac Molar , respectively , 3M , St. Paul , MN . Sample size estimate use 95 % significance level . Based caries prevalence population study perform investigator , number volunteer estimate one hundred volunteer gather require two hundred lesion . Three evaluation conduct every six month completion eighteen month follow-up . All exams control perform Dental Clinics University Talca one train calibrated examiner . Sealants place follow manufacturer 's instruction . Participants randomly allocate either study arm , regardless clinical indication , selection bias avoid . Material retention lesion progression primary end-point control . Likewise , caries incidence untreated teeth secondary outcome study .</detailed_description>
