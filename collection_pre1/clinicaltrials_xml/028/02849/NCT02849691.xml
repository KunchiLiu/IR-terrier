	<brief_summary>Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) important regulator incretins inflammation , participate pathophysiological process acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . However clinical data DPP4a AMI patient sparse . This study investigate role plasma DPP4 activity ( DPP4a ) patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . This analysis consecutive patient conduct tertiary referral center January 2014 October 2015 . The investigator include 747 STEMI-patients , treat PCI January 2013 October 2015 . Blood sample collect immediately admission . The patient divide four group accord DPP4a quartile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) acute manifestation coronary heart disease , remain frequent cause death.A well understanding risk factor pathogenic mechanism underlie STEMI may help improve prognosis life quality patients.Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) exopeptidase express surface diverse cell , cleave amino-terminal dipeptides either L-proline , L-alanine serine penultimate position . As cell surface protein , participate immune regulation , signal transduction apoptosis . DPP4 also circulate soluble form plasma . Soluble DPP4 come either membrane type clearance secrete cell like endothelial cell , enzymatic activity . Plasma DPP4 activity ( DPP4a ) elevate several disease , include type 2 diabetes , obesity , atherosclerosis osteoporosis . Basic study show DPP4 inhibition lead improved survival heart function cardiac ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury , partly due activation AKT ( pAKT ) , pGSK3 ANP pathway . Also inhibition DPP4 alleviate atherosclerosis heart failure . Accordingly , one could hypothesize high DPP4a may worsen myocardial I/R injury , cause poor cardiovascular outcome . However , study evaluate whether DPP4a associate adverse clinical outcome STEMI patient .</detailed_description>
