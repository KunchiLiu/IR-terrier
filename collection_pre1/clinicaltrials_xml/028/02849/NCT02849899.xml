	<brief_summary>Post-transplant diabetes affect 15 20 % renal transplant patient contributes increase morbidity reduce survival transplant patient . Corticosteroids , anti-calcineurin mammilian Target OF Rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor major diabetogenic impact greatly contribute increase diabetes prevalence transplantation . There date study concern pharmacological prevention post-transplant diabetes . Hecking et al . recently report short treatment insulin , administer immediately transplantation , reduce incidence de novo diabetes one-year post-transplant . This study include 50 renal transplant patient show three month treatment ( Neutral Protamine Hagedorn ) NPH insulin decrease HbA1c . The occurrence diabetes , secondary end-point , reduce 73 % treat group . No pharmacological strategy develop date . Relevant experimental evidence suggest gliptins could use pharmacological prevention post-transplant diabetes . These drug inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) , inactivate incretins , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) . DPP-4 inhibition cause increase GLP-1 GIP concentration induce insulin secretion inhibition glucagon secretion . The gliptins approve treatment type 2 diabetes . Beyond effect blood glucose , gliptins pleiotropic effect include protective effect β cell anti-inflammatory effect . The additional cost associate new-onset diabetes transplantation could also significantly reduce efficient prevention . A US study find , period 1994 1998 , newly diagnose diabetic patient cost $ 21,500 medical expense 2 year transplantation . Moreover , transplantation result one best increase patient ' quality life , estimate essential treatment evaluation population .</brief_summary>
