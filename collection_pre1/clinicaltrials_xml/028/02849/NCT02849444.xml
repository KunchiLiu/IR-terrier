	<brief_title>A Study Assess Renal Function Response Treatment Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Creatinine Clearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , multicentre , post-authorisation observational study . Study population : Patients relapse multiple myeloma CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 , investigator decides start new line anti-myeloma treatment per normal clinical practice . The decision prescribe treatment clearly disassociate decision include patient study . 300 patient expect recruited ( 225 Group 1 75 Group 2 ) 40 site ( approximately 7-8 patient site ) . Patients include consecutively study . The inclusion stratify ensure presence stage renal impairment ( RI ) two group : Documentation 300 patient plan ( maximum 225 group 1 minimum 75 group 2 ) 40 site ( approximately 7-8 patient per site ) . The patient include study consecutive manner . In order ensure correct stratification sample group real time central registry keep patient include group . Once required number patient one group complete , inclusion group close site , keep inclusion group open , entire sample size complete . Primary objective : To assess response renal function clinical practice anti-multiple myeloma therapy patient relapse MM creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2 ) . The prospective follow-up period cover two phase : 1 . Treatment phase : cover entire time patient receive first anti-myeloma treatment relapse* he/she include study . 2 . Follow-up phase : A 36-month extension period end first anti-myeloma treatment relapse he/she include study . - Any change therapeutic regimen , example , discontinuation addition drug ( except change dose initial drug ) mark end treatment phase pass patient follow-up phase . In case temporary interruption treatment 30 day ( duration reason interruption toxicity ) patient continue treatment phase , provide initial treatment regimen relapse resume . Secondary objective : - To describe clinical demographic characteristic patient relapse multiple myeloma CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 . - To assess response rate renal function clinical practice anti-multiple myeloma therapy patient relapse multiple myeloma CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 . - To assess response renal function base therapeutic regimen administer . - To explore concordance kidney function response myeloma clinical practice anti-myeloma treatment consecutive relapse patient . - To assess time-dependent response parameter . - To analyse safety treatment administer clinical practice . - To describe use resource associate anti-myeloma therapy clinical practice measure financially , explore possible difference various therapeutic regimen administer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients gender , age equal 18 year . 2 . Patients document relapsed multiple myeloma accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion . 3 . Patients document renal damage define creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml / min / 1.73 m2 ( CrCl &lt; 50ml / min / 1.73m2 ) . 4 . Patients researcher decides initiate antimyeloma treatment relapse one agent accord clinical practice * . 5 . Patients consent write clearly explain nature purpose study ( write inform consent ) . 6 . Subject follow characteristic ( least one 2 follow option must Yes ) : Subjects previously participate study Subjects previously participate study , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion apply , whose current relapse consecutive relapse prompt initial inclusion study . The decision prescribe treatment clearly dissociate decision include patient study Clarification provide aim study , encompass relapse subcategories include International Myeloma Working Group consensus document publish 2006 . Therefore , patient clinically relapse multiple myeloma , relapse follow complete response progression ( include refractory case ) define point 8.1 table 4 protocol , consider eligible candidate participation EPAMIR 50 study , long meet criterion 1 . Patients participate interventional clinical trial * refuse participate study . 2 . Patients CrCl &lt; 50 ml / min / 1.73m2 due cause multiple myeloma properly document discretion investigator * . The inclusion patient participate another observational study permit .</criteria>
