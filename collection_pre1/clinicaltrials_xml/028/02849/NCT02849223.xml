	<brief_summary>The primary aim study assess magnitude transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) -induced cognitive functional change patient mild traumatic brain injury . This study also attempt identify biomarkers associate treatment response . Last , acceptability tolerability procedure assess . To accomplish aim , randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled , parallel group , pilot study conduct participant assign 24 session tDCS sham stimulation offer concurrent work memory training . Neural efficiency measure electroencephalogram ( EEG ) pre post-intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) safe , non-invasive neuromodulation technique show promise intervention technique . The primary aim study assess magnitude tDCS-induced cognitive functional change patient mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . In double-blind , sham-controlled , pilot study , 24 veteran mild TBI randomize tDCS sham condition . Stimulation administer StarStim neurostimulator 2 milliamps ( mA ) 20 minute . The anodal electrode place leave dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex . Twenty-four session stimulation administer concurrent 20 minute work memory training . Participants continue additional 40 minute work memory train post-stimulation . Participant experience neuromodulation assess self-report questionnaire list common reaction tDCS . Participant perception value neuromodulation procedure assess week 4 8 . A second aim identify biomarkers treatment response . Resting state electroencephalogram ( EEG ) collect three time point : prior first tDCS training session , immediately first training session , post-intervention . This study provide preliminary evidence efficacy provide tDCS intervention enhance cognitive functional outcome individual mild traumatic brain injury . Furthermore , result study also increase understand mechanisms tDCS enhances cognitive performance . This knowledge potential provide insight underlie therapeutic process well guide development next generation intervention . In addition , acceptability intervention monitor identify potential barrier administer tDCS clinical practice .</detailed_description>
