	<brief_summary>This study authorize California Legislature ( Assembly Bill 266 , Medical Marijuana Regulation Safety Act ( 73 ) help detection drive influence cannabis . One hundred eighty healthy volunteer inhale smoke cannabis either 0 % ( placebo ) , 5.9 % , 13.4 % Δ9-THC beginning day , complete driving simulation , iPad-based performance assessment , bodily fluid draw ( e.g. , blood , saliva , breath ) cannabis smoking number time subsequent 6 hour cannabis smoking . The purpose determine ( 1 ) relationship dose Δ9-THC driving performance ( 2 ) duration drive impairment term hour initial use , ( 3 ) saliva expire air serve useful substitute blood sample Δ9-THC judicial hearing ( 4 ) test use iPad serve useful adjunct standardize field sobriety test identify acute impairment cannabis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Field Performance Test iPad Evaluate Driving Under Influence Cannabis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several study suggest high dos whole-blood Δ9-THC concentration associate increase crash risk crash culpability . However , attempt define cut-off point blood Δ9-THC level proven challenge . Unlike alcohol , level reasonably measure use breathalyzer ( confirm blood test ) , detection cut-off point intoxication relate Δ9-THC concentration elude scientific verification . Recent evidence suggest blood Δ9-THC concentration 2-5 ng/mL associate substantial drive impairment , particularly occasional smoker . Others counter level lead false positive , particularly heavy cannabis user inasmuch THC may detectable blood specimen 12-24 hour inhalation . Given 12 24 hour well beyond likely period drive impairment , would appear justifiable objection per se cut-off point Δ9-THC concentration indicative impairment . Maximal drive impairment find 20 40 minute smoke , risk drive impairment decrease significantly 2.5 hour , least smoke 18 mg Δ9-THC le , dose often use experimentally duplicate single joint . Other study , however , report residual MVA crash risk cannabis use within 4 hour prior drive . The roadside examination use Standardized Field Sobriety Test ( SFST ) proof cannabis-related impairment ideal alternative blood level . Originally devise evaluate impairment influence alcohol , SFST comprise three examination administer standardized manner law enforcement officer . The 'Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus ' ( HGN ) , 'One Leg Stand ' ( OLS ) 'Walk Turn ' test ( WAT ) require person follow instruction perform motor activity . During assessment , officer observe record sign impairment . In one study , Δ9-THC produce impairment overall SFST performance 50 % participant . In separate study involve acute administration cannabis , 30 % people fail SFST . This discrepancy rate failure think part due participant 's cannabis use history . The reported frequency cannabis use vary week every 2-6 month study failure SFST 50 % participant . The study include frequent user smoke cannabis least four occasion per week . Based upon , another mean need help law enforcement officer discern drive influence cannabis . One future possibility development performance-based measure cannabis-related impairment . This include test critical tracking , time estimation , balance visual spatial memory learning . The investigator select brief measure order practicably administer repeatedly short time period , well test potential translate tablet-based format , benefit possibly include future performance-based measure use field law enforcement officer ( e.g. , cannabis-focused field sobriety test ) .</detailed_description>
