	<brief_summary>In recent year show catheter ablation symptomatic atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) superior antiarrhythmic drug therapy regard effectiveness clinical outcome . Atrial fibrillation common cardiac arrhythmia , high rate concomitant heart failure , stroke mortality . During ablation procedure , patient manage intravenous sedation General Anesthesia ( GA ) . Within set , General anesthesia associate improved procedure time cure rate compare sedation . Airway management GA achieve laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) endotracheal tube ( ETT ) . The use LMA compare ETT show different surgical population decrease procedure recovery time , improve hemodynamic stability reduce anesthetic requirement . It also show decrease airway complication , postoperative nausea/vomiting important factor affect overall patient satisfaction . Although general anesthesia electrophysiology procedure associate high cure rate , report increase airway trauma.Additionally , believe volatile anesthetic may associate increase ventricular action potential duration well prolonged QT interval . The increased usage opioids general anesthesia also think interfere electrophysiology study affect vagal tone . At Virginia Commonwelath University ( VCU ) Health system , Anesthesiologists successfully use LMA ( General Anesthesia ) ablation PAF eligible patient five year . The investigator plan perform retrospective review patient underwent catheter ablation PAF Virginia Commonwealth University Health System January 2014 - December 2015 . The primary endpoint evaluate procedure time . Other data collect include demographic , cardiac history , type anesthesia , amount intra-procedure opioids , time discharge post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , total length hospital stay , intra-procedure hemodynamics , intra-procedure ionotrope/chronotrope/pressor requirement . atrial fibrillation recurrence 3 month follow-up .</brief_summary>
