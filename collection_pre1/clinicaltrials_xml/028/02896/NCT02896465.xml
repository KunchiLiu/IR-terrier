Children either sex fully partially breastfed one week enrolment ( since breastfed child receive naturally HMO , inclusion ORS/zinc HMO/ORS/zinc arm would critically interfere study question ; depend child 's age 30 50 % mother would icddr , b ) . However , unblinded reference group constitute agematched child breastfed moment hospitalization acute diarrhea mother want continue breastfeed study ward ( breastfeed exclusion randomize group ) . 2 . Suspected confirm cholera detect positive DF examination stool collect admission . ( The large volume quick evacuation stool could interfere product presence gut ) 3 . Symptom duration &gt; 48 hour screen . 4 . Vomiting severity likely make administration retention test product impossible . 5 . Severe malnutrition define ( use zscores ) : severe stunting ( SS ; heightforage zscore &lt; −3.00 ) ; severe underweight ( SU ; weightforage zscore &lt; −3.00 ) , severe wasting ( SW ; weightforheight zscore &lt; −3.00 ) , use World Health Organization reference value . Moderate malnutrition define follow : moderate stunting ( heightforage zscore −3.00 &lt; −2.00 ) ; moderate underweight ( weightforage zscore −3.00 &lt; −2.00 ) ; moderate wasting ( weightforheight zscore −3.00 &lt; −2.00 ) . We consider child wellnourished zscores weightforage , heightforage weightforheight zscore form −2.00 +1.00 . Children moderate malnutrition enrol since develop higher frequency PD ) . 6 .
