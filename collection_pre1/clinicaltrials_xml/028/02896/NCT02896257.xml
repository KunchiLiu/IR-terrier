	<brief_title>De-implementing Inhaled Steroids Improve Care Safety COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) among common medical diagnosis among Veterans . Approximately half carry diagnosis COPD prescribe inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , despite ICS role among patient without fix airflow obstruction ( AFO ) limit role among . Guidelines explicitly state ICS COPD patient limit severe AFO frequent exacerbation . Even benefit come cost , ICS use show multiple randomize controlled trial increase rate pneumonia . After prolonged exposure , ICS also associate high bone fracture risk , incidence cataract poor diabetes control . Among patient without disease mild-moderate AFO low risk exacerbation , ICS demonstrate efficacy , retain risk harm . For reason , evidence-based guideline specifically recommend use mild-moderate AFO . The goal project improve delivery safety care de-implementing ineffective use ICS among Veterans diagnosis COPD otherwise lack clinical indication medication . The primary aim reduce ICS use among Veterans limited clinical indication medication . Investigators test intervention de-implement unnecessary use inhale corticosteroid Veterans chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) pulmonologists assume responsibility support COPD patient . The investigator compare substitution approach use proactive patient-tailored electronic consult ( E-consult ) compare usual care single-session education outreach , represent non-intensive unlearning approach . The investigator target intervention Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) provider randomize either receive intervention receive intervention . For patient within intervention PACTs , project clinician leverage VA 's integrate healthcare informatics system use specialist support proactive patient-tailored electronic consults ( E-consult ) inputting unsigned order behalf Primary Care Providers ( PCPs ) recommend facilitate de-implementation ICS . Primary care provider final say accept ( sign ) , modify , decline recommendation .</detailed_description>
