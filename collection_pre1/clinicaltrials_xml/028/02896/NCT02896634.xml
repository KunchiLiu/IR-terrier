	<brief_summary>Dried Blood Spot DBS collection blood capillary drop spot dried filter paper use different bioanalysis . In comparison conventional blood testing , DBS offer practical , analytical , clinical financial advantage . This less invasive sampling already use infectious disease screen useful person poor venous ( baby , drug user elderly ) . Mass-spectrometry-based analysis allow protein quantification low amount blood sample . In project combine two approach measure DBS blood protein clinical relevance -including many FDA approve biomarkers ) . The detection relevant clinical analytes validate available patient sample accordance clinical norm ISO15189 requirement CE IVD mark .

	<detailed_description>Analyses blood spot dried matrix ( DBS ) , use since 1960s clinical chemistry neonatal screening . Since , many clinical analytes , include nucleic acid , small molecule lipid , successfully measure use DBS . DBS collection fact less invasive classical venous puncture , carry patient home ship regular mail particular risk contamination . The use DBS routine detection transmissible disease , well follow-up chronic disease like diabetes , represent safer less costly evolution clinical biology society . However routine use DBS yet limit . The major limitation use DBS represent small blood volume associate DBS sample ( 5-10 μL ) limit possibility detect peptides protein . In program , address issue adapt DBS mass spectrometry ( MS ) quantification proteins/peptides . This rely detection distinctive proteotypic peptide ( peptide sequence specific unique protein ) . The specificity assay use triple quadrupole mass spectrometer base capability detect peptide three molecular characteristic : retention time , precursor ion mass ( m/z ) fragment ion mass ( m/z ) . The combination precursor ion mass fragment ion mass z , highly specific , call transition . This approach name several peptide detect single run `` multiple reaction monitoring '' MRM . Using approach , direct analysis trypsin digest blood sample possible without additional sample fractionation . In series preliminary experiment , could detect single DBS puch 6mm diameter , 35 plasma protein . Several protein clinical relevance apolipoprotein A , B , C , ceruloplasmin , haptoglobin , plasminogen , transthyretin ( prealbumin ) serum albumin . We extend range blood protein detect MS. Focus put select biomarkers generate clinically relevant panel use patient monitoring , nutrition monitor follow-up frailty elderly people . Innovative workflow obtain rapid , efficient costless detection develop . We also evaluate new type DBS card ( Noviplex™ ) collect plasma instead whole blood , expect achieve well clinical concordance result DBS classical sampling . The detection relevant clinical analytes validate available patient sample accordance clinical norm ISO15189 requirement CE IVD mark . This allow commercial development ( kit , protocol ... ) realize industrial partner Spot-to-lab . This start-up already put market DBS analyse result previous collaborative research . Being able measure peptide/proteins DBS parallel clinical analytes also develop Spot-To-Lab ( vitamin D , HbA1c… ) represent breakthrough give major perspective use DBS clinical chemistry disease detection monitoring .</detailed_description>
