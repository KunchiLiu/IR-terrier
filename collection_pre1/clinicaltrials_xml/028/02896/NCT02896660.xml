	<brief_summary>HITLAB conduct crossover study wherein participant ask wear actigraphy device continuously 12 week . The first four week study participant continue previously schedule treatment regimen , prior receive Probuphine implant . Following four week activity sleep baseline monitoring use actigraphy device , participant receive Probuphine implant part regularly schedule treatment plan . Observation participant 's activity level continue eight week follow implantation Probuphine .

	<detailed_description>HITLAB conduct crossover study measure activity level sleep quality patient treatment Probuphine order determine whether Probuphine offer additional benefit improve energy level treatment , distinguish opioid dependency treatment . HITLAB researcher meet participate site physician prior study recruitment order administer `` Physician Baseline Questionnaire , '' brief semi-structured baseline questionnaire assess initial physician expectation actigraphy device . Per physician guideline , patient must stable treatment least 1 month prior study enrollment . If physician determines Probuphine appropriate treatment method study subject , physician meet subject explain purpose actigraphy . Upon enrollment , physician administer `` Participant Baseline Questionnaire , '' assess general well-being , physical activity level , sleep pattern , technology usage . At time , participant ask begin wear Actigraph continuously 12 week . The first four week study patient continue previously schedule treatment regimen , prior receive Probuphine implant . Following four week activity sleep baseline monitoring use actigraph device , participant receive Probuphine implant [ day 30 ] . At visit , clinician administer four clinical assessment : Assessment Withdrawal Opioids Scale ( SOWS ) , Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale ( COWS ) , Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) , Measures Morning Desire use/need use tool Braeburn Pharmaceuticals ( HS-11-421 ) , well baseline quality life assessment ( WHOQOL-BREF ) . Observation participant 's activity level continue total eight week follow implantation Probuphine . Actigraphy measurement include total time asleep , total time awake , sleep efficiency , time mobile . At midline 60-day visit participant , part regular monthly treatment appointment , physician repeat administration four clinical assessment ( The Assessment Withdrawal Opioids Scale ( SOWS ) , Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale ( COWS ) , Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) , Measures Morning Desire use/Need use tool Braeburn Pharmaceuticals ( HS-11-421 ) ) , well quality life assessment ( WHOQOL-BREF ) . At participant endline visit [ 90 day ] , physician administer repeat quality life questionnaire ( WHOQOL-BREF ) , four clinical assessment : Assessment Withdrawal Opioids Scale ( SOWS ) , Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale ( COWS ) , Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) , Measures Morning Desire use/need use tool Braeburn Pharmaceuticals ( HS-11-421 ) . In addition , five participant randomly select participate short qualitative interview time site endline visit . Participant interview , person via telephone , assess experience use actigraph device treatment , perspectives activity change sleep quality . Patient perspectives activity change sleep quality serve point triangulation actigraphy data . HITLAB conduct baseline site visit , site visit 30 day , 60 day , 90 day ( endline visit ) study period collect questionnaire assessment data analysis . Actigraphy data upload day 30 , 60 90 . At endline site visit , participate physician ask complete brief , semi-structured `` Physician Endline Questionnaire '' ass satisfaction actigraphy device help improve outcome quality life patient Probuphine treatment . A HITLAB researcher also conduct brief qualitative interview physician endline site visit . The in-person physician interview ass whether actigraphy data inform patient experience way improve efficacy Probuphine administration treatment .</detailed_description>
