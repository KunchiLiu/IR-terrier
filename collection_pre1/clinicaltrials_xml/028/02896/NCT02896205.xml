	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis multisystem disease involve lung form ILD . Lung involvement common cause death patient . The present study perform study efficacy oral mycophenolate mofetil treat early mild ILD patient SSc . The efficacy side effect mycophenolate mofetil compare oral placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Compare Efficacy Mycophenolate Mofetil Systemic Sclerosis Related Early Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung involvement lead cause death among patient systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . Treatment immunosuppression drug help retard progression interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) improve morbidity mortality among patient . Presently , cyclophosphamide show useful stabilize lung function among patient systemic sclerosis ILD . But use cyclophosphamide also associate many adverse effect include infection , cytopenia , gonadal dysfunction malignancy . Use oral mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) SSc-ILD recent study show effective retard progression ILD among patient well side effect profile compare cyclophosphamide . Contemporary expert opinion dictate treatment SSc-ILD need individualize . Generally , intense immunosuppression require patient FVC &lt; 70 % predict . In patient FVC &gt; 70 % predict , need high dose immunosuppression clear varies center-to-center . The present study design determine efficacy oral MMF patient SSc relate early ILD . The subject study give either oral MMF placebo monitor response adverse event . Informed consent take subject include study .</detailed_description>
