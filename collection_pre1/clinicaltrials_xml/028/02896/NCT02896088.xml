	<detailed_description>Currently , real scope sealant ( AS ) poorly document temporary dentition effectiveness demonstrate . Yet seem reasonable AS temporary dentition could slow specific development carious lesion early childhood . In addition , non-invasive approach could delay conventional food thus save financial cost complex treatment . Finally , installation AS could afford , demonstrate adult teeth , lower cariogenic bacteria prevalence engage caries process . Main objective : To evaluate effect AS caries incidence deciduous dentition obtain period three year , take account risk caries establish initially . Secondary objective : 1 . To assess prevalence caries attack site end year 2 . Estimate retention rate ( partial complete ) AS study 3 . Determine cost saving treatment trial period</detailed_description>
