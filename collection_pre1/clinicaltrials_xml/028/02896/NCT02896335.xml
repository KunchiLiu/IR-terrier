	<brief_title>Palbociclib In Progressive Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . - This study design evaluate efficacy safety palbociclib recurrent brain metastasis . Palbociclib study use treatment broad range cancer . This type drug inhibits cell growth cell call cyclin-dependent kinase promote tumor cell proliferation . - The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve palbociclib participant specific disease approve us</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm disease solid tumor Participants must measurable disease CNS , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ≥10 mm . Participants must progressive CNS lesion , define one following : Patients may multiple progressive CNS lesion , treat SRS surgery . Patients eligible one untreated ( surgery SRS ) progressive lesion measurable . Patients measurable residual progressive lesion surgery . Patients prior WBRT and/or SRS eligible need unequivocal evidence progression least one lesion treat radiation ( e.g . tissue diagnosis ) . Biopsy consider definitive diagnosis . Patients previously treat systemic therapy CNS metastases eligible . Age ≥ 18 year . The toxicity palbociclib child unknown . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal OR &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal allow direct bilirubin within normal range . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . baseline QTc &lt; 480ms The effect palbociclib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 6 month completion palbociclib administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Tissue prior craniotomy biopsy genetic sequencing ( least one FFPE block 15 unstained slide ) . Patients previously assess genetic sequencing meet requirement section 9.2.1 need additional tissue available prospective genetic sequencing . Presence alteration CDK pathway ( amplification CDK4 , CDK6 , CCND1 , CCND2 , CCND3 CCNE1 loss CDKN2A ) Patients progressive extracranial disease exclude . Stable corticosteroid least 7 day Prior treatment CDK4/6 inhibitor Participants chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent Participants receive concurrent chemotherapy immunotherapies cancer ( except patient receive letrozole , anastrozole , exemestane , tamoxifen , fulvestrant , trastuzumab , bisphosphonates , ovarian suppression therapy ) Leptomeningeal involvement cancer History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition palbociclib ( include abemaciclib ) Participants receive medication substance moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A isoenzymes ineligible . Lists include medication substance know potential interact CYP3A isoenzymes provide Appendix C , also find within section 5.4 . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequentlyupdated list http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ; medical reference text Physicians ' Desk Reference may also provide information . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study effect palbociclib develop fetus unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother palbociclib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated palbociclib . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction palbociclib . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Current use drug know prolong QT interval ( See Appendix C ) Unable undergo MRI scan . QTc &gt; 480 msec ( base mean value triplicate ECGs ) , family personal history long short QTc prolongation , Torsade de Pointes ( TdP ) . Uncontrolled electrolyte disorder compound effect QTcprolonging drug ( eg . hypocalcemia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia</criteria>
