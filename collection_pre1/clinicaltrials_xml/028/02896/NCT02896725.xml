A participant consider slow heal venous leg ulcer ulcer area large 5 cm2 and/or ulcer present six month . Participants receive four visit research nurse - visit 1 screen eligibility , visit 2 consent randomise participant , visit 3 4 collect outcome data . District nurse continue visit participant ( weekly frequently require ) provide routine care research nurse visit . Block randomisation use , stratify study centre prognostic index ( ulcer size great 5cm2 and/or ulcer duration great 6 month ) ensure balance participant within study centre participant likely slow healer . Research nurse input information inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion , relevant clinical history consent participant via tablet computer . The allocation generate information enter . Randomised participant receive allocate treatment reference ulcer heals data collection complete , whichever occur sooner .</detailed_description>
