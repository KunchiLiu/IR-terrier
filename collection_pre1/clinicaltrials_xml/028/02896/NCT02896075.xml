	<brief_summary>The purpose study first investigate effect control intervention comedy video pain tolerance social set quantitatively measure laughter young healthy population experience delay onset muscle soreness . The comedy intervention compare control watch documentary . The second aim examine extent various method elicit pain would cause physiological response confound interpretation pain stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic pain affect 116 million people , total affect cardiovascular disease , cancer , diabetes combine . Chronic pain least large negative impact quality life chronic disorder , United States alone , cost chronic pain exceed $ 635 billion per year . Interventions effectively manage chronic pain become increasingly important elderly population , often suffer osteoarthritis low back pain , rise . Pain sensitivity tolerance impact variety affective factor . The laughter therapy one discuss often controversial strategy management pain . There preliminary uncontrolled study report pain tolerance increase acutely humor laughter . Accordingly , primary aim present study investigate effect highly control intervention comedy video pain tolerance compare control watch documentary video . Quantitatively measure laughter chest stress-strain gauge intervention allow investigator look possible dose response relationship . The investigator use pain soreness felt delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) healthy subject simulate condition individual suffer chronic pain . This study serve precursor eventual study specifically individual chronic pain . If proven pain tolerance increase healthy population possible intervention great affect chronic pain population . Using healthy subject delay onset muscle soreness allow investigator easily recruit control diseases disorder may accompany chronic pain individual . There number different technique use assess pain tolerance . The mode stimulate pain use previous study laughter humor pain tolerance remain controversial . These study utilize cold pressor test inflation blood pressure cuff elicit pain . Both method know elicit mark cardiovascular response along pain response . An important part pain regulatory process human functional interaction cardiovascular pain regulatory system . The brain region underlie control cardiovascular system know overlap substantially contribute anti-nociception . Accordingly , difficult determine much pain tolerance affect cardiovascular reflex . Thus , secondary aim present study test much cardiovascular response elicit variety method elicit pain ( pump blood pressure cuff , cold pressor test , application blunt force muscle ) . The application blunt force use elicit pain without cause systemic response involve cardiovascular reflex see cold pressor inflation blood pressure cuff . The investigator believe vast cardiovascular response may cause pain tolerance truly measure . It infer blunt force apply within second local , specific spot quadriceps stimulate systemic cardiovascular response thus pain tolerance measurement accurate independent cardiovascular response . Pressure force application widely use experimental pain stimulus , utilized context laughter pain .</detailed_description>
