	<brief_title>Cyberknife After Breast Conservative Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The large majority local recurrence breast cancer breast conserve treatment close original tumor site . This evidence suggest restrict radiotherapy target surgical cavity select patient . Consequently , short fractionation strategy focus tumor bed small cuff surround subclinical disease , i.e . accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) , develop . Stereotactic radiotherapy thought , consist short course intense treatment focus target tissue . There little experience CiberKnife early breast cancer . This study prospective non-randomized study design ass acute , sub-acute , late toxicity , cosmesis globally feasibility CyberKnife ( CK-APBI ) . From June 2013 June 2018 go enroll 80 patient consider eligible present study . All patient follow least 2 year . A first enrollment 20-25 patient schedule first assessment . Breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) aid mammography ultrasound examination confirm best selection patient . For assessment acute toxicity , cosmetic result three different observer ( physician , patient , external observer ) , medium term late toxicity , patient evaluate result record immediately radiotherapy , 1 month , three , six , nine , twelve , twenty-four month . The toxicity correlate main radiotherapy treatment dosimetry delivery record .</detailed_description>
