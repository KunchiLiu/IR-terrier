	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , common non-traumatic cause neurologic disability young adult , affect mobility ambulation majority patient . Nearly 50 % person MS require assistive device ambulate within 10 year diagnosis . A subgroup MS Primary Progressive MS , manifest gait disturbance 80 % patient long term . In addition alter gait , nearly 70 % patient experience cognitive deficit course disease . Therefore , action facilitate patient involvement find solution personalize management disease disability need . Although immunomodulatory drug offer benefit type Multiple Sclerosis , currently effective treatment Primary Progressive MS. A fundamental goal management person MS maximize ability ambulate perform safe effective transfer everyday life . In last decade , research increasingly center effect robot device rehabilitation patient neurological disease . This lead development new robot-assisted gait device engender virtual-reality system , several study demonstrate positive effect device gait endurance quality life patient neurological disease disability . The aim project develop study effect novel , cognitively intensive virtual-reality -based rehabilitation software application simulate real-world environment person walk . The virtual-reality application upgrade version synchronize robotic device , GEO System . The second aim compare cognitive motor effect robot-assisted gait training application train robot-assisted gait training without virtual reality . The experimental group receive robot-assisted gait train virtual-reality application control group receive robot-assisted gait train All subject undergo train 6 week ( 2 sessions/week ) total 12 session . Assessments train , training , follow-up perform use clinical instrumental test compare effect train . Successful completion study may help patient alleviate impact disability , increase independence activity daily life , improve quality life . Through new rehabilitative strategy combine cognitive motor training involve high brain function motivation , patient stimulate walk reality-based environment .</brief_summary>
