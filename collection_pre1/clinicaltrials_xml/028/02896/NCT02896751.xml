	<brief_summary>This small pilot study look feasibility create customized sleep mask use Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) similar treatment sleep apnea . The participant three dimensional ( 3D ) picture face take special camera . The picture send 3D printer mask create base participant 's face contour . The participant use mask 6 month . The study measure amount use sleep increase report comfort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use 3D Printer Make Custom Sleep Masks Positive Airway Pressure Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study improve adherence effectiveness noninvasive ventilation decrease side effect commonly see noninvasive ventilation . Studies show even though noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) positive airway pressure ( PAP ) successful treat obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation , individual poor compliance therapy . The reason poor compliance numerous , one significant continually report reason poor mask fit . A poor mask fit uncomfortable , frequently cause side effect dry eye , congestion , skin irritation breakdown , ineffective ventilation inadequate pressure due air leak around mask . Pediatric patient tend especially difficult fit conventional mask small facial feature lack mask develop pediatric use . In study , patient fit custom make NIV mask follow facial image 3D camera ( Artec 3D Scanner ) . The facial image use construct NIV mask model use computer design software create use 3D printer .</detailed_description>
