	<brief_summary>Pelvic fracture integrate acetabulum fracture represent risk traumatic injury sciatic nerve trunk stretch section ( 1 ) : Judet Letournel report complication rate around 6 % ( 1 ) . Fractures acetabulum strictly speak also provider neurological complication rate , significant , recently precisely detailed cohort study publish Lehmann et al . ( 2 ) : In series 2073 patient , author report overall complication rate neurological relate initial trauma order 4 % . In series , 1395 patient operated rate iatrogenic neurological complication 2 3 % . Regarding first route ( therefore type fracture ) , Kocher-Langenbeck path path lead great number neurological complication : 3 4 % series ( 2 ) . However , cohort study specify truncal achievement . Obviously violation posterior acetabular preferentially provider sciatic injury violation prior acetabular provider obturator femoral lesion . But always case . Moreover , study specify type severity neurological involvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology Design : This interventional study routine care , prospective , single-center . Main objective / secondary : Primary objective : To evaluate sensitivity neurophysiological monitoring combine two specific new procedure detect intraoperative complication sciatic trunk ( measure potential somatosensory storied collection P15 electromyographic record potential sciatic nerve popliteal fossa ) . secondary objective Frequency neurophysiological change intervention acetabulum . An anomaly retain : - Interval prolongation N8-P15 &gt; 10 % - And / decrease amplitude ratio P15 / N22 &gt; 50 % - And / elongation latency nerve potential &gt; 10 % value-operative Opr√© - And / reduce amplitude nerve potential &gt; 50 % Correlation impact change neurophysiological intraoperative - The occurrence postoperative neurological deficit : - motor deficit - / sensory deficit - territory sciatic trunk Correlation incidence intraoperative neurophysiological modification : - The type surgery - The type fracture</detailed_description>
