	<brief_summary>Some cancer patient report experience mild problem think follow chemotherapy . Symptoms include problem concentrate , slow thinking , gaps memory difficulty perform complex multi-tasks . These symptom often soon disappear treatment . However patient , may persist year significant effect quality life . The reason symptoms well understood . This study propose examine effect chemotherapy brain change brain affect one 's ability move one 's arm finger . By good understand negative consequence chemotherapy brain nervous system , hope help pharmaceutical company develop safe cancer treatment drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy ( CTh ) establish postoperative treatment often prescribed cancer patient reduce risk relapse . However , great proportion patient report experience cognitive , psychomotor , functional impairment associate CTh . Some symptom may persist year treatment dramatic consequence cancer survivor ' quality life . Despite numerous study report various symptom during/after CTh treatment , mechanism underlie symptom well understood . Recent animal human brain imaging study suggest CTh may direct neurotoxic effect brain , particular brain white matter ( WM ) . However , date , longitudinal study do examine effect CTh cortical/subcortical WM integrity human patient . Furthermore , effort yet make correlate give WM structure correspond neurophysiological function ( NPF ) behavior . This study propose longitudinal experiment woman diagnose breast cancer examine effect CTh corpus callosum ( CC ) corticospinal tract ( CST ) ( Aim 1 ) , NPF directly depend quality CC/CST structure , psychomotor behavior critically rely CC/CST function ( conductivity ) ( Aim 2 ) . The relationship CC/CST structural integrity correspond NPF psychomotor behavior also examine ( Aim 3 ) . The general underlying hypothesis study ( 1 ) CTh direct neurotoxic effect CC CST , result microstructural degeneration ( 2 ) structural damage CC CST impair relevant neurophysiological function behavior . This research expect yield significant information regard neural structural physiological cause CTh-related side effect ; know information would help effectively manage symptom . By demonstrate direct evidence detrimental consequence CTh central nervous system , hop evidence would encourage pharmaceutical company develop safe cancer treatment drug .</detailed_description>
