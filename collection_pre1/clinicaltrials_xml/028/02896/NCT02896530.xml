In 60 % case , vascular complication deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Several study show patient IBD risk venous thromboembolic disease ( VTE ) increase 1.5 3.5 . This risk closely related disease activity . However , association IBD arterial thromboembolic event case myocardial infarction , stroke , aortic thrombus , mesenteric ischemia , peripheral arterial disease member senior , describe less remains subject debate . These arterial complication occur young subject accountability IBD remain debated , clear pathophysiology . Here investigator describe series 6 case patient IBD develop severe arterial complication , whose cause retain digestive inflammatory underlying disease . This study report six ( 6 ) case describe</detailed_description>
