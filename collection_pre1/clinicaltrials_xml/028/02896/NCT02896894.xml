	<detailed_description>The study consist pragmatic randomized control trial ( RCT ) nest comparative effectiveness arm ass value intervention extension , concurrent Realist Evaluation . The pragmatic randomized trial ass whether intervention ( Big White Wall ) work introduce public health clinical setting , i.e. , real life condition . The qualitative realist evaluation ass contextual influence strategy Big White Wall adopt reject . 1 . Pragmatic Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) nest comparative effectiveness arm : The RCT include delay treatment crossover control . The immediate treatment group ( ITG ) get access BWW time enrollment continuous access period 3 month . The delayed treatment group ( DTG ) access first 3 month , receive access BWW 3 consecutive month . A 2:1 allocation ratio use randomized participant ITG DTG . After 3 month intervention , ITG participants opportunity opt-in intervention extension arm . Those opt-in randomized 1:1 ratio receive additional 3 month BWW additional intervention . Objective : To determine incremental benefit cost-effectiveness BWW patient mental health problem seek care hospital-based mental health program . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize user BWW experience increase mental health recovery orientation evidence use standardized recovery assessment tool . The investigator also hypothesize improvement observe symptom depression anxiety , along quality life community integration . Recruitment/Study Setting : A total 1000 study participant recruit 3 large mental health setting Ontario : Ontario Shores Mental Health Sciences , Lakeridge Health , Women 's College Hospital ( WCH ) .

Services BWW include peer support , self-guided facilitate self-help resource , psycho-educational material interactive creative activity . All participant maintain anonymity site unique non-identifiable user identifier ( ID ) . All participant receive unique access code BWW . Use BWW participant dependent , ability log utilize service frequency . Data Collection : Baseline socio-demographic data collect following consent . Self-report data outcome collect via questionnaire baseline , 3 month 6 month . Baseline outcome questionnaire complete 1 3 way : 1 ) web survey ( default ) ; 2 ) phone ; 3 ) in-person hard copy . All questionnaire administer web-based survey . Data Analysis : Data analysis do study completion , data collect . Analysis blind treatment allocation . Initially , descriptive analysis conduct variable . The primary outcome , The Recovery Assessment Scale-Revised ( RAS-r ) 3 month , analyze intent-to-treat analysis use ANCOVA control baseline RAS-r score well treatment group , unadjusted adjusted baseline Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , baseline Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) , age , sex , education , relationship status , household income , duration episode , recruitment setting . In sensitivity analysis , investigator repeat use marginal structural model account attrition . The analysis repeat secondary outcomes 3 month control baseline score treatment group . In subset ITG participant opt nest extension study , investigator examine outcomes 6 month treatment group . Analysis primary secondary outcome repeat described , control score baseline 3 month . The first exploratory analysis examine subset ITG group PHQ-9 GAD-7 score least 10 baseline . Participants categorize 'responders ' 'non-responders ' base whether achieve least 50 % reduction PHQ-9 GAD-7 3 month relative baseline . Second , investigator examine engagement BWW among ITG participant . The number logins total time site separately predict age , gender , education , relationship status , live situation , household income , baseline belief treatment credibility outcome expectancy , baseline PHQ-9 GAD-7 score , duration current episode , recruitment set outpatient mental health visit . In term economic evaluation , combination program cost , out-of-pocket cost cost health care system use determine total cost associate participant program . Incremental cost-effectiveness assess use incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculate difference cost DTG ITG divide difference outcome group . 2 . Qualitative Realist Evaluation Protocol The Realist Evaluation occur alongside pragmatic randomize trial describe , include two key method . The first qualitative interview key stakeholder involve implementation use BWW , second observation introduction use virtual care intervention among health care provider participant . Objective : The objective qualitative realist evaluation component study ( ) understand perspective mental health care provider regard appropriateness BWW patient , ( b ) explore participant ' perspective usability acceptability BWW online community , ( c ) examine key issue associate scale BWW across Ontario .

The qualitative research team purposefully sample pool interested ITG participant consent contact interview study enrollment . The investigator aim interview 4-6 participant site , span different age category , total 12-15 patient participant . Qualitative interview complete 5-7 health care provider site ; 2-4 organizational leader site ( example , clinical manager ) ; 5-7 health system decision maker Ontario . These participant identify clinical site lead use snowball sample process identify key informant . Data Collection : Patient interview conduct via telephone personal video conferencing .

Participants opt intervention extension arm study ask whether interested participate qualitative interview . Participants identify willing contact may may participate qualitative interview first phase study , purposefully sample interview 2-4 week re-randomization process manner initial interview . The investigator recruit 2-3 participant 3 site total 12-15 patient participant extension arm . Healthcare provider also invite participate interview 1-2 week post-education session BWW . Health care provider interview take place location work via telephone . Organizational leader invite participate interview person via telephone 3 4 month post BWW implementation .

The finding qualitative data use develop statement relationship ( ) key contextual factor , ( b ) mechanism effect implementation virtual care intervention , ( c ) impact outcomes intervention . These statement use develop understanding ( ) specific mechanism BWW effective user , ( b ) strategies inform future implementation BWW and/or similar intervention large scale .</detailed_description>
