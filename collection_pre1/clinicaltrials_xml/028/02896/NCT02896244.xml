	<brief_summary>During antibiotic treatment , antibiotic residue impair intestinal microbiota ( gut flora ) lead adverse effect emergence bacterial resistance occurrence antibiotic-associated diarrhoea ( AAD ) include antibiotic-induced C. difficile infection ( CDI ) . The spread resistant Gram-negative bacteria increase number severity CDI consider worldwide public health threat . Da Volterra biotechnology company develop novel product , DAV132 ( medical device Europe ) , intend prevent antibiotic adverse effect . Da Volterra planning carry phase 2-3 randomized control trial ( RCT ) DAV132 prevention antibiotic-induced CDI . The RCT involve hospitalize patient age ≥50 year old treat predefined antibiotic class know increase risk CDI . The incidence CDI population unknown , yet , incidence important determinant require sample size . Therefore , main objective current study ass CDI incidence patient ≥50 year age treat predefined antibiotic class . In addition , optimise target population DAV132 RCT , effect predefined antibiotic agent intestinal microbiota assess . Furthermore , biomarkers predictive CDI occurrence might help identify patient high risk disease , could optimise RCT . No validate biomarkers describe literature yet . Assessment potential biomarkers another aim present study .</brief_summary>
