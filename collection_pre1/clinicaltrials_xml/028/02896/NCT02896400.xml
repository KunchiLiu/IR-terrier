	<brief_summary>The investigator propose innovative full-factorial design cohort 1056 adult smoker urban emergency department ( ED ) , test efficacy four key intervention component : motivational interviewing , medication , quitline referral , texting . At trial 's completion , mixed-methods approach use identify component efficacious within propose cost constraint , along feasibility acceptability provider subject . The investigator assemble intervention maximizes efficacy , give cost-effectiveness constraint finding qualitative analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose optimize identification treatment adult smoker see hospital ED . To Multiple Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) employ develop multicomponent intervention consist combination follow : ( 1 ) Brief Negotiation Interview ( BNI , variant motivational interview ) , deliver train research assistant ; ( 2 ) provision 6 week nicotine patch gum research participant , application first patch ED ; ( 3 ) active referral Connecticut Smokers ' Quitline ; ( 4 ) enrollment SmokefreeTXT short-messaging service ( SMS ) texting program mobile phone . Using MOST principle , first phase study use 2x2x2x2 full-factorial design identify component likely efficacious combination . Although factorial design require allocation participant 16 different combination 4 component ( Table 1 ) , evaluation individual component perform compare receive component receive component , make efficient design . For instance , evaluation BNI component compare randomize arm 1 8 arm 9 16.The second phase consist design propose 2-arm randomized clinical trial compare efficacy multicomponent intervention package usual care ; conduct future application . The specific aim propose study : Aim 1 . To conduct fully power factorial randomize trial 1056 adult smoker test efficacy 4 key component ED-initiated tobacco treatment : BNI , NRT , QL referral , SMS texting . Aim 2 . To identify efficacious component intervention , within fix constraint cost effectiveness feasibility/acceptability provider subject . Aim 3 . To lay groundwork future randomize trial test previously identify component , deliver package , control arm new cohort adult ED smoker . Our associated hypothesis : 1 . At 3 month , least 1 intervention component yield biochemically verify tobacco abstinence rate least 5 % great control condition . Carbon monoxide breath test use biochemical verification . 2 . At 3 month , least 1 intervention cost-effective , use societal perspective . 3 . At 3 month , least 1 intervention acceptable feasible provider subject .</detailed_description>
