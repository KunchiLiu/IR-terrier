	<detailed_description>The goal study explore SynPhNe system use easily home people suffer stroke . With study , also investigate SynPhNe system use could improve hand function use session research therapy . SynPhNe non-invasive device . It consist piece worn around forearm , head component communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth computer provide subject feedback perform motor task hand . The head cap record brain activity give feedback help relax exercise . We combine use device research orient rehabilitation program supervise environment . The SynPhNe system approve U.S. Food Drug Administration . Subjects randomize chance ( like coin toss ) one two group : lab-based upper extremity research therapy alone lab-based upper extremity research therapy addition SynPhNe system home-based exercise . - The lab-based upper-extremity research therapy content similar regular occupational therapy focus exercise movement arm hand . - The group test SynPhNe system home system lent cost . The study last 12 week involve 22 session total : - Up 3 session test arm movement ( baseline , research therapy 1 month follow-up ) . - 18 research therapy session . 10 do Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital therapist 8 , home .
