	<brief_summary>The path patient depend largely health care network , say interrelationship health professional involve throughout career . At hospital , transition point care process vulnerable time patient regard continuity medication . These transition point intake , transfer outlet . In town , health system must able build inter-city hospital , warranty essential guarantee continuity care . However , often breakdown relationship less serious consequence range simple dissatisfaction patient , realization duplicate examination use unjustified emergency re-hospitalization . Medication error occur , result incomplete information poorly communicate city hospital interface . The city hospital dysfunction mainly organizational , hospital rather specialized therapeutic approach center pathology medicine city instead focus patient 's overall approach . The involvement pharmacist hospital , city interesting axis develop . In town , pharmaceutical nomadism , include major city remain low , patient generally dedicate pharmacy treatment serious chronic pathology . The development pharmaceutical dossier today allow pharmacy access history entire therapy patient prescribed town different specialist general practitioner , last 4 month . Its recent availability within hospital Group allow u consider use fully optimize patient 's drug monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Securing Optimizing Patient 's Drug Therapy With Cancer : Clinical Pharmacy Articulation With City</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis The involvement hospital pharmacist admission patient oncology department release , comprehensive review treatment anticipation therapeutic need return home joint organize community pharmacist doctor , reduce rate drug discontinuity thus improve therapeutic management . Goal We want integrate evaluate clinical pharmacist activity different stage patient care process transition point : - The admission drug conciliation determine exhaustively medication history observe difference , assess patient 's treatment adherence , consider revision treatment necessary - During stay daily pharmaceutical validation drug prescription make DxCare play drug iatrogenic participate definition pharmacotherapy , - In preparation release drug per patient reconciliation inform advise patient treatment communicate relevant information city health professional . 1 . / DRUG RECONCILIATION TO ENTRY - Rational We remember , share different hospital function , least one example Event Junk Medicated ( EIM ) suffer patient participate management medication error . The frequency Adverse Event Graves ( SAEs ) exclusively relate health product estimate 1.7 per 1000 SAE avoidable hospital day , 1 SAEs per day 1,000 bed hospital . This study show strong exposure preventable SAEs among elderly vulnerable . Indeed , promote factor occurrence iatrogenic injury population manifold : multi-pathologies , polypharmacy , organic impairment , cognitive impairment , inadequate mode administration . Some therapeutic error result poor communication city hospital , lead hospitalized patient take home treatment exhaustively know . It also estimate 67 % drug history patient one medication errors 46 % error occur time draft new order entrance exit patient 's hospital . The EQUIP study show risk prescription error increase 70 % intake phase patient hospital phase . On hand , report 60 % cancer patient use complementary alternative medicine , must vigilant take medication potentially iatrogenic ( MAC-AERIO study 2010 ) . Goal Detect differences prescription city hospital establish complete exhaustive list treatment take patient hospitalization , avoid medication error , appearance start point EIG . procedure The hospitalization Medical Oncology Service 20 bed ( 14 traditional hospital bed six week hospital bed ) average rate entry per day 3-4 patient , 1 2 per week new patient . Patients see hospital pharmacist within &lt; 24h admission , &lt; 72 h late entry Friday , Saturday , Sunday morning . 1 . / The reconciliation begin review treatment call Bilan Medicated Optimized ( BMO ) . The list drawn regard medication take patient whether prescribed . To formalize , necessary conduct interview patient / entourage well city health professional care facility . The first source information exploit patient 's pharmaceutical record ( open ) , accessible via vital card resume treatment provide last 4 month . If drug bring home patient , another useful source information . BMO This achieve 2 way : - Proactive Patient enter Sunday Thursday . The draft first order service yet take place , BMO use prescriber draft Ordinance Medicinal Products admission ( OMA ) . Accordingly , error drug therapy intercept take place . This option require conciliation pharmacist make early patient 's care hospital . - Retroactive patient already prescription hospital Â© DxCare follow admission . BMO establish draft OMA . It discrepancies conciliation allow intercept correct . It follow write additional information new prescription correct detect difference . 2 . / The difference observe may unintentional ( medication error ) correspond involuntary treatment change likely generate adverse event patient , intentional document correspond voluntary change treatment , reason indicate patient file . It may addition , modification interruption medicament . This lack information likely generate medication error later . The characterization difference result 3 step : - Each drug line characterize medical decision seem take . The drug thus consider stop , suspend , continue state , continue amendment , substitute add . - Then search annotate medical decision patient 's file show decision document . When , treatment line validate . When , conclude discrepancy . - At late stage , physician participation mandatory describe degree intent undocumented divergence : divergence characterize intentional unintentional . Following implementation reconciliation rule , three decision possible drug line study : - The drug validate online - In case undocumented intentional discrepancy , medical decision explain filling patient file - In case unintended discrepancy , prescription correct , medication error . Any deviation must document BMO . The lack information leave wrong think discrepancy intentional , hence importance document prescription medical decision explicit . By con , gap properly call unintentional must correct : drug error cause harm patient caught . 3 . / The finalized conciliation document validate hospital pharmacist end embedded patient record reuse transfer discharge .</detailed_description>
