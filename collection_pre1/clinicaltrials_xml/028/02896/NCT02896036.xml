	<brief_summary>Purpose : The primary objective compare time require adequate intraperitoneal insufflation ( skin incision reach intraperitoneal pressure 15 mmHg ) . Also number attempt need successful entry achieve . The secondary objective evaluate rate secondary outcome measure ; fail entry , extra peritoneal insufflation , vascular injury , visceral injury , gas embolism , solid organ injury , omental injury two technique . Study design : prospective randomize control trial Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize participant 's undergoing laparoscopic surgery benign Gynecologic indication TGH undergo laparoscopic entry technique Veress needle entry concomitant CO2 insufflation require less time achieve 15 mmHg intraperitoneal pressure oppose Veress needle entry subsequent CO2 insufflation , require less number attempt achieve successful entry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject Recruitment Consent : All female patient age 18-70 schedule benign gynecologic laparoscopic surgery TGH participate attend surgeon recruit . Each participant educate study ; objective , potential benefit risk , research team obtain informed consent . Plan enroll 90 participant . Materials Methods : This randomize control trial participant randomly assign laparoscopic entry Veress needle connect CO2 tube concomitant insufflation versus Veress needle entry subsequent connection CO2 tube insufflation . The investigator inform patient two entry technique pre-operative office visit . Participants consent participate study prior surgery study research coordinator pre-operative visit . Patients consent study still undergo schedule procedure standard entry technique clinically indicate provider . Randomization occur operating room surgery start . The healthcare provider perform procedure open next sequentially numbered envelope , within piece paper indicate entry technique perform . This record study log . The study log include enrolled participant , assign study number range 001 minimum number participant require study indicated sample size calculation ( see ) . The participant position dorsal lithotomy position prepped draped standard fashion . Preoperative antibiotic provide per standard indication procedure . For group participant randomize concomitant CO2 insufflation ; Veress connect CO2 tubing , skin incision make scalpel , follow start CO2 gas insufflation insertion Veress needle . If opening pressure less equal 10 mmHg , process insufflation allow continue . In case high opening pressure , Veress withdrawn reinserted 3 time . A failed entry call peritoneal cavity insufflate 3 attempt . For group patient randomize subsequent CO2 insufflation ; Veress needle connect CO2 tubing , skin incision make scalpel , follow insertion Veress needle . The gas insufflation start open pressure note . If opening pressure less equal 10 mmHg , process insufflation allow continue . In case high opening pressure , Veress needle withdrawn reinserted 3 time . Each time needle reinserted , CO2 insufflator switch location Veress needle felt adequate . The time record incision time take achieve intraperitoneal pressure 15 mmHg . In addition primary secondary outcome study , participant demographic information , procedure specific variable outcomes collect record study log ( See data collection sheet ) . Common laparoscopic complication also record , include follow : - Vascular injury : tear injury intraabdominal blood vessel . - Visceral injury : serosal ( superficial ) full thickness ( deep ) injury small large bowel . - Gas embolism : entrapment carbon dioxide injure vein , artery solid organ , result blockage right ventricle ( RV ) pulmonary artery - Solid organ injury : injury solid abdominal pelvic organ include limited , liver , spleen uterus . - Failed entry : failure establish pneumoperitoneum 3 attempt Veress insufflation . - Extraperitoneal insufflation : insufflating preperitoneal space carbon dioxide . - Omental injury : injury great omentum result bleed omental insufflation . Sample size : 90 patient recruit base sample size calculation already perform .</detailed_description>
