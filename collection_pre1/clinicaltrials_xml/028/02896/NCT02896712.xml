	<detailed_description>Drug addiction chronic , devastate , treatable disorder , exist grow armamentarium evidence-based intervention , include pharmacotherapies psychotherapy . A core principle drug addiction treatment , however , state single treatment appropriate everyone ; rather , treatment need adjust base patient characteristic response order maximally effective . Ideally , clinician would identify sequence intervention work best across different stage addiction treatment , abstinence initiation relapse prevention . Adaptive treatment intervention use successfully inform sequential clinical decision-making process . For cocaine use disorder ( CUD ) , potent intervention currently available initiate abstinence behavior therapy use contingency management ( CM ) procedure . Intensive CM show produce initial cocaine abstinence rate 40 % , unmatched form behavioral pharmacological treatment , make prototypical first-line therapy CUD . Importantly , achievement initial abstinence predict future abstinence . For clinician , research finding translate straightforward question : Can investigator drive CM response rate even higher targeted adjunctive intervention ? The propose sequential , multiple assignment , randomize trial ( SMART ) provide data need answer question . First , investigator determine whether Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) combination CM increase initial treatment response rate . The investigator hypothesize four week treatment ACT+CM produce high abstinence rate initial treatment combine standard Drug Counseling CM ( DC+CM ) . The hypothesized synergism ACT+CM primary treatment mechanism experiential avoidance reward sensitivity , respectively , examine . Second , patient respond initial treatment , investigator examine whether dopamine-targeted pharmacotherapy effective augmentation strategy . Specifically , investigator hypothesize continued ACT+CM treatment modafinil augmentation effective promote abstinence relative treatment combination involve continued DC and/or placebo . Third , patient respond initial treatment , investigator assess relative benefit continue treatment ACT+CM , compare DC+CM , prevent relapse . ACT emphasize goal-directed action base value intrinsically motivate , thereby expect effective intervention extend duration abstinence follow initial treatment intensive CM .</detailed_description>
