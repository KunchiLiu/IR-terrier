	<detailed_description>Estimates sleep disruption traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) reach 81 % , incidence nature , course effect recovery TBI well understood TBI sleep study include mixed TBI severity sample vary time post injury . In early rehabilitation phase recovery moderate-to-severe TBI , sleep disturbance estimate 78 % associate presence post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) ; transient period disorientation , confusion inability store memory occur TBI . Individuals TBI PTA severe memory dysfunction significantly impair ability benefit verbal instruction , often confusional state agitate behavior . They require 24-hour , highly structure environment safety PTA resolve . PTA last day week , time individual his/her family significantly distress . Its duration also practical implication term resource , length hospitalization cost . There appear relationship sleep disturbance PTA early recovery TBI , nature relationship fully understood . Sleep disturbance associate delirium non-TBI medical patient , sleep deprivation associate significant negative effect attention , reaction time , visual-motor performance , language function , memory process , executive function normal population . Sleep disturbance appear negatively affect cognitive function medical normal sample . In TBI population , sleep disruption could exacerbate already compromise cognitive function prolong PTA . The relationship sleep disruption PTA present potentially significant therapeutic opportunity PTA largely consider fix immutable therapeutic option . Therapeutic effort improve sleep may reduce length PTA . The propose study begin address gap knowledge nature , incidence effect sleep disturbance recovery moderate-to-severe TBI early rehabilitation period . It also pilot sleep hygiene protocol improve sleep individual early rehabilitation phase TBI . It employ 24-hour per day sleep observation actigraphy characterize incidence type sleep disturbance early rehabilitation phase TBI . In addition , study serially test participant multiple time week Orientation Log ( OLOG ) Confusion Assessment Protocol ( CAP ) closely monitor change alertness , orientation , attention , memory function behavior emerge PTA . The sleep observation actigraph information compare cognitive measure PTA examine relationship sleep quantity quality cognitive function recovery PTA . The randomized controlled trial minimization allocation ( RCT ) pilot component study first therapeutic attempt aware ; normalize sleep cycle sleep quality individual TBI sleep disruption early rehabilitation . Twenty individual TBI low sleep efficiency actigraphy initial night time screen randomize comprehensive sleep hygiene protocol ( SHP = 10 ) standard care ( SOC = 10 ) protocol three week . Both group access rehabilitation facility , therapy , service program . The difference group systematic attempt improve sleep SHP five principle component : 1 ) improve night sleep environment , 2 ) increase daytime activation , 3 ) enhance circadian stimulus , 4 ) morning ADL routine individually adjust pre-injury biological sleep pattern 5 ) caffeine intake . In SOC group , systematic effort influence circadian rhythm , daytime activation nighttime sleep environment . Participant 's sleep group monitor 24-hour actigraphy staff rating sleep-awake period throughout 24 hour period Makley Sleep Scale ( MSS ) four week . Additionally , nurse staff rate agitation Agitated Behavior Scale therapy staff monitor cognitive functioning Orientation Log ( OLOG ) Confusion Assessment Protocol ( CAP ) emergence PTA . The sleep data , cognitive test behavioral information group enable examination relationship sleep PTA potential benefit SHP normalize sleep enhance cognitive recovery , include resolution PTA .</detailed_description>
