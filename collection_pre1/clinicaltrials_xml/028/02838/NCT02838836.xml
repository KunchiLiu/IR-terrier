	<brief_title>Tumor Cell DNA Detection Blood , Urine Bone Marrow Patients With Solid Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients resectable solid primary cancer even limit number metastasis potentially curable . However , patient develop recurrence despite surgery . Circulating disseminate tumor cell ( CTC/DTC ) circulate cell-free ( cf ) DNA isolation blood , urine bone marrow increase understand cancer spread advance knowledge develop individualized therapy . Hypothesis Rationale : CTCs/DTCs cfDNA isolate blood , urine bone marrow cancer surgery undergo pheno- and/or genotype change . CTCs/DTCs potential dissemination tumor growth vivo . Investigating biology liquid biomarkers blood , urine bone marrow significantly increase understand cancer biology . Specific Aims : CTCs/DTCs cfDNA isolate cancer patient characterize genetic alteration expression key signaling/proliferation biomarkers grow vivo nude mouse . Study Design : 100 patient undergoing solid cancer surgery recruit perioperative CTC/DTC/cfDNA isolation blood , urine bone marrow innovative technique . In addition , 10 patient undergoing similar surgery benign disease also include control . CTCs/DTCs , cfDNA cancer tissue pheno- and/or genotype analysis perform different innovative technique . Furthermore , CTCs/DTCs enrich , culture characterize . Tumor growth potential study nude mouse . Relevance : This translational cancer trial address fundamental aspect cancer disease cause death 1 4 person US . Innovative CTCs/DTCs characterization shed light tumor biology , identify therapy target . Results study fundamentally important understand cancer spread development personalize therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects older 18 year . Subjects genders ethnicity . Subjects diagnosis solid cancer ( n=100 ) stage include ( lung , esophageal , stomach , bile duct/pancreas , colorectal , melanoma , sarcoma ) . Ten patient present suspicion previous history cancer ( except basal cell cancer skin ) undergo surgery benign indication serve control ( n=10 ) . In patient undergo surgery cancer histopathology preferably pathologically proven previous novel biopsy . Yet , patient high cancer suspicion radiology clinical picture undergo cancer surgery exclude . No additional biopsy , test intervention perform purpose study medical treatment require . Subjects must capable give informed consent . Pregnant woman . Subjects concurrent diagnosis active secondary ( synchronous ) malignancy besides basal cell carcinoma skin exclude , evidence disease burden patient currently treat chemotherapy . Subjects hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dl morning procedure exclude . In subject require intraoperative transfusion &gt; 4 unit red pack blood cell ( RPBCs ) , blood drawn CTC/DTC/cfDNA analysis surgery postoperative day 1 . In patient coagulation disorder could lead significant bleeding ( hemophilia , significant thrombocytopenia ) require prophylactic administration coagulative product , bone marrow aspiration perform .</criteria>
