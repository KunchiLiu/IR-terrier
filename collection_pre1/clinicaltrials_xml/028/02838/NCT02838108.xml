	<brief_title>The Relationship Between GOLD Risk Group Clinical Outcomes Community-based COPD Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design collect information current level symptom ability breathe , treatment outcome patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . This information use researcher well understand impact COPD patient . It also help researcher study current recommendation treatment COPD . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) represent grow public health problem third lead cause death United States . The risk exacerbation , hospitalization death patient COPD tend increase increase severity airflow limitation . However , correlation force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , symptom , health-related quality life weak . The shortcoming use airflow limitation alone assess clinical severity COPD lead Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) committee develop potentially clinically meaningful approach assess impact COPD patient . The GOLD committee subsequently propose model pharmacologic therapy patient stable COPD ( i.e . currently experience COPD exacerbation ) accord GOLD risk group . The therapeutic recommendation propose GOLD widely cite strategy select therapy even though model predominantly base expert opinion . This study acquire data community-based cohort patient COPD classify GOLD risk group A-D enrollment follow longitudinally . This study assess frequency change GOLD risk group 5 year follow-up , look use COPD medication cohort provider-selected therapy COPD compare GOLD-recommended pharmacologic therapy thus address critical knowledge gap scientific community .</detailed_description>
