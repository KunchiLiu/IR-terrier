	<brief_summary>The goal project identify strategy reduce wound complication woman undergo cesarean delivery Pfannenstiel skin incision . Currently , many Pfannenstiel skin incision close subcuticular suture follow either placement Steri-Strips Dermabond . Either Steri-Strips Dermabond place wound cover unclear may reduce wound complication rate . The hypothesis study Dermabond result reduction wound complication rate compare Steri-Strips . Previously publish study non-obstetric population identify Dermabond potential intervention reduce wound complication . The eligible population study include woman NorthShore University HealthSystem Evanston Hospital University Chicago Hospital undergo primary repeat cesarean delivery via Pfannenstiel skin incision . Women study randomize receive either Steri-Strips Dermabond . The primary outcome evaluate wound complication include wound infection ( cellulitis subcutaneous infection ) , wound separation ( partial complete ) , wound seroma/hematoma . Secondary endpoint investigate include cosmetic outcome , patient satisfaction , cost comparison , difference total time application .</brief_summary>
