	<detailed_description>Background Dry Needling ( DN ) skilled intervention use acupuncture filiform needle insert myofascial trigger point tissue underneath skin [ Dunning ] . Trigger point spot taut muscle fiber produce local radiate pain irritated , example press upon . Several theory etiology trigger point exist , local energy crisis increase acetylcholine release due mechanical muscle overuse [ Bron ] . The existence trigger point widely accept [ Hong ] , although also vocal opponent [ Quintner 2015 , Quintner 1994 ] . The aim DN treat myofascial neuromusculoskeletal pain improve movement impairment . The mechanism DN purportedly work subject debate many year . It generally accept needle inserted trigger point , produce local muscle twitch response consequently 'inactivate ' trigger point [ Dunning ] . Some propose quick muscle contraction induces normalization tissue pH reduction biochemical neurotransmitter stimulate pain receptor - local response [ Shah ] . Others suggest DN interrupt trigger point 's ongoing nociceptive input dorsal horn - segmental response [ Fernandez-de-las-Penas ] . Others submit , trigger point affect limbic dorsal hippocampus activity , DN might central response [ Niddam ] . The efficacy DN also completely clear , show trend . One early literature review meta-analysis conclude DN significantly superior placebo control regard pain decrease [ Tough ] . However , since several systematic review meta-analyses [ Tekin , Kietrys , Boyles ] determine evidence suggest DN trigger point-derived pain likely effective approach , superior decrease pain compare stretch percutaneous electric nerve stimulation least effective manual trigger point release needle treatment . One literature analysis support use DN immediate , also short-term effectiveness reduce pain patient upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome [ Kietrys ] . Controlled trial assess DN efficacy either use 1 ) sham control ( inactive treatment ) 2 ) treatment ( lidocaine injection , non-local DN , `` usual care '' , stretch exercise ) comparison group . A blunted needle penetrate skin good sham treatment [ Streitberger ] recommend adequate control . As discuss elsewhere [ Streitberger ] , every needle penetration , trigger point , induce physiological response appropriate use control . Srbely et al . find one intervention trigger point stimulation DN evoke palliative effect area innervate spinal segment . They dry needled trigger point supraspinatus assessed pressure sensitivity change infraspinatus ( segment , C5 ) gluteus maximus ( different segment , L4/5 , S1 ) . Their result suggest pain pressure threshold increase 3 5 minute DN area supply C5 segment , area supply L4/5 , S1 . The name study assess immediate pain-related change due intervention ass functional improvement . The investigator study able find article investigate phenomenon low extremity . This project use similar set study , subject receive sham DN , real DN non-trigger point tissue ( , explain , still elicit physiological effect could segmental influence ) name study . In addition , investigator explore functional improvement subject receive DN . Consequently , investigator propose perform follow control study explores question 'Does site specific trigger point dry needle evoke segmental neuromodulation lower extremity , change make impact subject 's disability ? ' . The aim : I ) Regarding Pain 1 . Assess pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) decrease muscle receive DN 2 . Assess PPT decrease muscle receive sham DN ( perforate skin ) 3 . Assess low back pain decrease treatment group compare sham group II ) Regarding Functionality 1 . Assess level disability due pain lower one week treatment subject receive DN 2 . Assess level disability due pain significantly low subject receive DN compare receive sham III ) Regarding Mechanism 1 . Assess specific trigger point DN evoke segmental neuromodulation lower extremity ; mean trigger point muscle innervate certain segment DN , trigger point segment exhibit decrease PPT well . 2 . Assess PPT associate trigger point infraspinatus change DN low back Our hypothesis : I ) - H1 : PPT decrease gluteus maximus/medius one week DN - H2 : Trigger point receive DN sham needle ( perforate skin ) exhibit amount decrease PPT compare trigger point DN actual treatment DN II ) - H3 : Low back pain decrease treatment group compare sham - H4 : The level disability due pain decrease one week DN treatment - H5 : The level disability due pain significantly low subject receive DN treatment compare subject receive sham treatment III ) - H6 : Specific trigger point dry needle evoke segmental neuromodulation lower extremity ; mean investigator DN trigger point gluteus maximus/medius , innervate L4/L5 , trigger point segment ( i.e . multifidus segment L4/5 ) exhibit decrease PPT well - H7 : PPT associate trigger point infraspinatus change DN low back Subjects refer Peaks Performance Physical Therapy ( Baton Rouge , Louisiana ) diagnosis 'trigger point gluteal muscle ' , 'myofascial pain ' , 'neuromuscular pain ' 'low back pain ' ( similar ) demonstrate painful taut band tight muscle tissue gluteal muscle infraspinatus complain radiate pain point pressure exert onto tight muscle tissue . Methods Prospective subject undergo physical examination co-author PC identify inclusion exclusion criterion . The main inclusion criterion presence painful trigger point gluteals ( gluteus maximus medius ) infraspinatus side . The painful trigger point define distinct hypersensitive taut band within muscle begin radiate diffuse pain adjacent area sustain pressure . In keep study conduct Srbely et al . investigator include trigger point baseline ( pre-intervention ) pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) value 35 N less order improve reliability detection . The precise location trigger point mark skin use non-toxic marker ease follow-up identification . If patient deem eligible study , investigate PT explain study prospective subject he/she ask he/she want participate . The PT explain subject might get actual DN technique , instead sham . If subject decline he/she receive treatment 'normal ' . If he/she agrees , he/she receive inform consent read sign . If study-related question answer . After subject fill intake sheet demographic information , modify Oswestry Disability Questionnaire ( mOSW ) [ Copay ] well pain map visual analog scale ( VAS ) low back pain . The subject determine his/her group allocation draw piece paper opaque envelope . This envelope contain 40 piece paper ; 20 specify 'dry needle A ' ( treatment ) , 20 specify 'dry needling B ' ( sham ) . The rest physical therapy treatment pragmatic ; subject receive mobilization ( grade 5 : high velocity low amplitude ) , exercise indicated DN one week ( 2-3 visit ) . Grade 5 mobilization ( manipulation ) exclude treatment option believe elicit neurophysiological effect , similar DN , might skew result . Study flow/ data intake 1 . The investigator measure pressure sensitivity via algometer gluteal muscle , ipsilateral multifidus level L4/5 ipsilateral infraspinatus . 2 . The investigator dry needle trigger point find gluteal region one side ( e.g . right ) document muscle twitching ( would signify appropriate needle insertion ) OR sham dry needle ( blunt needle , actual penetration skin occur ) 3 . Exercises perform need ( pragmatic , manipulation ) . This regimen follow maximally one week , ( less , pain abolish ) . 4 . At end week PPT measure , VAS , mOSW 15-point Global rating change scale ( GRoC ) [ Kamper ] questionnaires give result document . Data Analysis PPT reading normalized baseline score focus percent change , absolute change value . - H1 : baseline PPT measurement gluteus maximus/medius 20 subject receive DN compare post PPT measurement , take one week DN analyze use pair t-test - H2 : change PPT gluteus maximus/medius 20 subject receive DN compare change PPT 20 subject receive sham DN analyze 2-sample t-test - H3 : VAS score change 20 subject receive DN compare VAS score change 20 subject receive sham DN analyze 2-sample t-test - H4 : The baseline mOSW score 20 subject receive DN compare post treatment score mOSW analyzed pair t-test - H5 : The change mOSW GRoC scale score 20 subject receive DN compare change mOSW GRoC scale score 20 subject receive sham DN analyze 2-sample t-test - H6 : Pre- post treatment change PPT gluteus maximus/medius compare change measure multifidus segment L4/5 analyze pair t-test - H7 : Pre- post treatment change PPT gluteus maximus/medius compare change measure infraspinatus analyze pair t-test All significance level set 0.05 . The minimally clinically important difference ( MCID ) VAS 2 point [ Childs ] , OSW 12.8 point [ Copay ] 'important improvement ' GRoC 5 point [ Kamper ] .</detailed_description>
