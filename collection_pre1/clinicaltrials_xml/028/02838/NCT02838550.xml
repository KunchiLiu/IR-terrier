	<brief_title>Increasing Physical Activity Through Motivational Online Intervention Using Pedometers Sedentary Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular practice physical activity ( PA ) show benefit physical mental health . However , level PA low general population . Pedometers motivational online intervention ( MOI ) use increase PA level sedentary population . In spite find positive outcome PA level theoretical construct derive theory behavior change Internet use guide pedometer-based intervention , intervention incorporate variable together analyze short-term mid-term result . The main objective study analyze effect short self-administered Motivational Online Intervention ( MOI ) use pedometer increase PA level ( primary outcome ) change different theoretical construct relate PA behavior ( positive decisional balance , self-efficacy , process change , stage change , enjoyment ) ( secondary outcome ) sample sedentary student 3-weeks intervention ( post ) 3-months ( follow-up ) . It compare three condition : MOI+PEDOMETER condition ( access MOI use pedometer new generation ) ; MOI condition ( access MOI use blind pedometer ) ; CONTROL condition ( use blind pedometer ) . Hence , two condition include component `` Transtheoretical Model Change '' intervention , facilitation decisional balance , increase self-efficacy , use experiential behavioral process change ( e.g. , consciousness raising , counterconditioning , reinforcement management , stimulus control ) , one condition receive feedback pedometer allow self-monitoring behavior .</detailed_description>
