	<brief_summary>The incidence type II glycogen-storage disease ( Pompe disease ) vary depend ethnicity geographic region . As 2010 , nine study publish document incidence Pompe disease . It common within African American population , incidence 1 14,000 . In U.S. broadly speak , combine incidence three variant disease 1 40,000 . These estimate rely frequency three mutation gene acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) , lead variant disease . Criteria inclusion study often non-selective ; many case , molecular genetic screen do birth . With high prevalence Pompe disease report , expect large university medical center specialize neuromuscular disease would see high incidence Pompe disease among patient . From comparable Italian multicenter study , appear Pompe disease account 3 % patient present proximal weakness without CK elevation . This study measure incidence Pompe disease base manifest laboratory abnormality , namely low GAA enzyme activity . Analysis GAA enzyme activity determine blood sample 4 mL . The study seek measure epidemiology Pompe disease symptomatically screen patient present symptom hitherto undiagnosed proximal weakness without elevation muscle enzyme , creatinine kinase ( CK ) , elevation CK alone , thirteen academic tertiary neuromuscular practice throughout United States Canada . Total recruitment expect ~1,500 participant . It anticipate number incident Pompe case cohort would 3-5 % , i.e . 45-75 newly diagnose case Pompe disease .</brief_summary>
