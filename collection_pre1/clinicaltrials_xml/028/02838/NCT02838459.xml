	<brief_title>Can Prediction Models Triage Trauma Patients More Accurately Than Clinicians ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title Can prediction model triage trauma patient accurately clinician ? Background Nearly 5 million people die trauma year . Hence trauma , define external injury combine body 's associated response , major contributor health issue globally . Trauma 's time sensitive nature differentiate health condition . Therefore , prioritisation crucial treat urgent trauma case first . This prioritisation generally refer triage . Henceforth , formalize non-formalized triage system distinguish , former define explicit triage consciously perform accord priori determine criterion , latter decision prioritisation clinicians subconsciously take absence formalize triage . There two conceptually different method currently use triage trauma patient . Triage may do clinician . Triage perform clinician may affect human factor tiredness experience , yet may view morally appropriate method triage trauma patient . Algorithms , statistical algorithm , may also construct triage purpose . To predict possibility certain outcome use statistical method call prediction modelling . Algorithms exclude human factor triaging patient . However , algorithmic triaging may seem morally inappropriate due absence human connection clinician patient . Formalised triage system frequently use trauma care high income country . Such system believe improved trauma care hence trauma patient outcome . However , 90 per cent death due trauma occur low- middle income country , formalised triage system uncommon non-existing . Formalized triage system may help strengthen trauma care low - middle income country . However , research lack whether algorithms clinician perform accurate triaging patient . Aim To compare performance prediction model clinician trauma patient triage . Method Study design Prospective cohort study Setting A prospective cohort study conduct India , low middle income country . India account 20 per cent global trauma death per year , hence effort strengthen trauma care India urgently need . Data collect four urban hospital : one Mumbai , one Kolkata , one Delhi , one Nellore . The collection data begin 11th July , however hospital situate Kolkata . Once ethical permission formally provide data collect remain hospital continue desire study size reach ( see study size ) . Data collect full-time project officer mention hospital . Participants Individuals present emergency department ( ED ) trauma participate hospital . The individual include study arrive ED . The project officer one include individual . The participate individual visit project officer still hospitalize 30 day . Otherwise , follow do per phone . Variables Models : RTS ( Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , Glasgow coma scale ( GCS ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) ) The Gerdin et al . model ( SBP , heart rate ( HR ) , GCS ) GAP ( age , SBP , GCS ) KTS ( SBP , GCS , RR , number serious injury ) Clinical judgement ( Clinicians assign triage category trauma patient categorise four color cod group . The group green , yellow , orange , red . The color intend represent trauma severity soon patient need treat , green correspond least severe patient red severe patient . ) Other descriptive variable : Sex , mechanism injury Outcome variable : Mortality within 30 day Study size 200 trauma patient mortality outcome patient survive time period . Mortality within 30 day assume 15 % , base past study . Thus , 1350 patient desire study size . The estimated time need collect desire data two month ( four project officer , one per hospital . A project officer collect data first ten patient per shift , 5 day per week . Thus , data collector collect data 50 patient per week 200 patient per month . The total collected data per month 800 patient . Two month collect data 1600 patient . Consequently , take two month reach desire study size . ) Quantitative variable Quantitative variable treat original study . In word , quantitative variable categorise non linear method use original study . Statistical method The performance prediction model clinician evaluate compare term discrimination , calibration reclassification . First , score obtain prediction model use assign patient green , yellow , orange red category . Discrimination assess calculate area receiver operate characteristic curve original score color grouping base score . Calibration assess calculate mortality color group , assume linear association increase severity high mortality . Finally , reclassification assess compare patient end group , depend whether group base prediction model clinician . Only patient complete data analyse . All analysis conduct use R statistical environment , use standard 95 % confidence interval 5 % significance level .</detailed_description>
