	<brief_title>Assessing Progression Type-2 Diabetes ( APT-2D ) : A Prospective Cohort Study Expanded From BRITE-SPOT ( Bio-bank Registry StratIfication Targeted intErventions Spectrum Of Type 2 Diabetes )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective open cohort study . The study comprise follow period : Screening â€¢ Complete screen checklist informed consent form Procedures . - Following screen visit , subject require return undergo follow : - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) ass glucose tolerance beta cell function - Frequently-Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance test ( FSIVGTT ) ass acute insulin response glucose - Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp ( EHC ) obtain insulin sensitivity index assess insulin action - The Disposition index ( DI ) quantify relationship insulin sensitivity insulin secretion , determine result obtain FSIVGTT EHC determine subject 's risk Type 2 diabetes . - OGTT repeat every 6 month assess conversion Type 2 Diabetes . Plasma C-peptide , glucose measure 7 time point OGTT minimal model assessment beta cell function - FSIVGTT EHC repeat within 3 month conversion Type 2 Diabetes , 3 year recruitment , whichever come sooner . Normoglycemic Subjects : 800 Pre-Diabetic Subjects : 1500</detailed_description>
