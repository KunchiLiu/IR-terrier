	<brief_summary>Though physician believe identify frail patient , frailty poorly characterize complex clinical syndrome . Frailty categorize four dimension de Vries et al : 1 ) physical ( physical activity , nutrition , mobility , strength energy ) ; 2 ) biochemical ( nutritional inflammatory biomarkers ) ; 3 ) psychological ( cognition mood ) ; , 4 ) social ( social contact support ) . 1 However , pathophysiology frailty remain unclear . Two broad hypothesis propose . Deficit accumulation model : This hypothesis assume frailty occurs due accumulation additive effect multiple deficit , occur across various domain . The deficit person , likely person frail . Frailty paradigm thus measure identifying number positive factors/ deficit list . This used create proportional index deficit , express ratio deficit present total number deficit consider . Many study use modify frailty index ( MFI ) 11 factor , show correlate well patient outcome surgery . Phenotype model : Fried et al 2001 propose phenotype base model , identify various clinical feature define frailty clinical syndrome . This criterion , know Fried index , consist 5 factors- shrinking , weakness , exhaustion , slowness , low physical activity level . The Fried index commonly use phenotype-based assessment tool evaluate frailty . An advantage ease-of use preoperative visit . Measurement factor perioperative set characterize Makary et al 2010 , basis Hopkins Frailty Score ( HFS ) . Currently , exist gold standard assessment frailty , especially perioperative setting . In absence well-accepted gold standard , measurement frailty would predict adverse postoperative outcome would useful . However , study compare prognostic ability HFS MFI , non-cardiac surgery . All adult patient present pre anesthesia evaluation clinic ( PACE ) Cleveland Clinic main campus include prospective observational cohort study . Frailty would evaluate prospectively use HFS component MFI obtain Cleveland Clinic Perioperative Health Documentation System registry ( PHDS ) .</brief_summary>
