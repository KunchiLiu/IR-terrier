	<brief_title>Insight Into Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipedema syndrome painful fatty enlargement buttock , hip thighs primarily woman lose diet , exercise bariatric surgery . Arms affect 80 % woman lipedema vary degree . The etiology lipedema know evidence-based treatment work majority individual except excision subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT ) liposuction risk . Millions woman affect lipedema yet grossly under-diagnosed , mobility issue develop lymphedema . The goal project well understand etiology lipedema SAT , find different non-lipedema SAT , improve ability identify abnormal SAT determine response tissue therapeutic image biomarkers . People diffuse Dercum 's disease ( DD ) appear lipedema plus tissue inflammation cause illness pain . People SAT disorder similarity lipedema also include protocol . More research need determine fatty disorder similar different obesity distinguish clinically laboratory test imaging . Since painful fatty disorder associate SAT growth , research focus disorder may provide unique insight mechanism obesity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Ambulatory male and/or female race able understand consent process . 2 . 1970 year age . 3 . Diagnosis lipedema , Dercum 's disease familial multiple lipomatosis similar fat disorder . 4 . Individuals without fat disorder ( match age , sex , race body mass index individual `` 2 '' ) . 5 . Weight stable past three month within 10 pound range per personal report subject . 6 . Overweight obese ( BMI &gt; 26 kg/m2 ) order able get enough SAT biopsy . 7 . Individuals BMI &lt; 26 kg/m2 may participate aspect study protocol except SAT biopsy . 8 . Thyroid level normal range confirm TSH level . May treat hypothyroidism stable 6 month . 1 . HIV infection ( associate lipodystrophy fatty growth [ lipomas ] ) . 2 . Subjects exclude SAT biopsy history scleroderma , keloid formation skin condition would result substantial scar biopsy , history recurrent cellulitis , history bleeding diathesis would place subject great risk persistent bleed biopsy/liposuction , history major complication previous biopsy include requirement blood transfusion , hospitalization , failure heal , major infection , require intravenous antibiotic , anyone whose skin tissue would put risk infection biopsy per assessment study staff principal investigator . These individual may participate remainder protocol , SAT biopsy . 3 . Use immunosuppressant corticosteroid medication . 4 . Use antiinflammatory medication NSAIDs , aspirin , histamine ( H ) 1 blocker , H2 blocker , tetracycline corticosteroid within five day study procedure visit . 5 . Use medication might cause weight gain ( e.g. , second generation antipsychotic ) . 6 . Blood donation le 56 day prior screen visit . 7 . Tobacco marijuana use may alter inflammation body . 8 . Any antibiotic within last month . 9 . Barium enema last week would affect gut bacteria MRI . 10 . Pregnancy due risk associate fat biopsy area fetus pregnancy alter hormone level .</criteria>
