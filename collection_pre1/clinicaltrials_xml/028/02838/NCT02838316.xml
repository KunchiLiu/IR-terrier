	<brief_title>Autologous Muscle Derived Cells Gastro-Intestinal Repair ( AMDC-GIR ) Tongue Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This preliminary , prospective , dose escalate clinical study evaluate safety potential efficacy Autologous Muscle Derived Cells Gastro-Intestinal Repair ( AMDC-GIR ) treatment tongue dysphagia ( TD ) develop follow treatment head neck cancer . Surgery , chemo- radiotherapy induce significant TD result long-term TD . Therefore , augment tongue muscle function may beneficial patient . Autologous muscle cell therapy , involve isolation cell skeletal muscle biopsy , ex vivo expansion , subsequent injection tongue , may serve potential durable therapy . In animal study , muscle derive cell successfully integrate within tissue improve tongue strength function . Intramuscular injection AMDC-GIR expect produce localize tissue change near injection site expect produce systemic effect . Patients receive single treatment intramuscular injection 1 2 dos AMDC-GIR . Patients quantitative qualitative measure dysphagia assess treatment various time treatment . The study treat 20 patient 1 clinical site . Enrollment expect complete within 2 year initiate study . Patients follow 24 month post-treatment . The first 3 patient dose must reach 1-month follow-up subsequent patient treat . Male female patient least 18 year age undergone surgery and/or chemo- radiotherapy primary treatment oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer present symptom finding TD eligible participation . Eligible patient muscle tissue harvest use needle biopsy technique outpatient procedure . The harvested muscle tissue transport manufacturer cell processing . The muscle derive cell ( MDC ) isolate expanded culture several week . After reach desired concentration , isolate expand AMDC-GIR frozen ship back investigate physician . The physician thaw AMDC-GIR dilute sample approximately equal volume physiological saline . Under direct vision , result suspension inject patient 's tongue brief outpatient procedure . Patients assess improvement TD symptoms 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month follow treatment . Adverse event assess visit , well follow-up call 1-2 day , 1 week , 15 month , 18 month 21 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male Female , least 18 year old , primary symptom TD follow surgery and/or chemo and/or radiotherapy treatment squamous cell carcinoma oropharyngeal cancer . Treatment must complete least 24 month prior enrollment , TD diseasefree status confirm medical history clinical symptom , include focus head neck examination evaluation , swallow fluoroscopy , high resolution pharyngeal manometry . 2 . TD severity moderate define Functional Oral Intake Scale ( FOIS , provide Appendix C ) . Individuals must FOIS 3 good . 3 . Patient fail achieve acceptable resolution symptom follow conservative therapy . Patient Historybased Criteria : 1 . Simultaneously participate another investigational drug device study complete followup phase primary endpoint previous study le 30 day prior first evaluation study . 2 . Previously treat investigational device , drug , procedure TD within 6 month prior sign consent . 3 . Has ever treat cell therapy TD . 4 . Symptoms aspiration pneumonia prior enrollment . 5 . TD neurogenic etiology uncorrected congenital abnormality lead TD . 6 . Neuromuscular disorder ( e.g. , Parkinson 's disease , muscular dystrophy , multiple sclerosis ) could lead TD . 7 . Moderate severe fibrosis likely injection site . 8 . Morbidly obese ( BMI â‰¥ 35 ) . 9 . Uncontrolled diabetes . 10 . Compromised immune system due disease state , chronic corticosteroid use , immunosuppressive therapy . 11 . Medical condition disorder may limit life expectancy may cause clinical investigation plan ( CIP ) deviation ( e.g. , unable perform selfevaluations accurately report medical history , symptom , data ) . 12 . History bleed diathesis uncorrectable coagulopathy . 13 . Known allergy hypersensitivity bovine proteins allergen , gentamicin sulfate , ampicillin medically warrant exclusion determine physician . 14 . Any nonskin cancer necessitate treatment within past 24 month . Patient 's Current Statusbased Criteria : 1 . Evidence know high risk recurrent persistent cancer determine physician screening . 2 . Tests positive Hepatitis B ( required test : Hepatitis B Surface Antigen [ HBsAg ] AntiHepatitis B Core Antibody [ AntiHBc ] ) , Hepatitis C ( require test : Hepatitis C Antibody [ AntiHCV ] ) , HIV ( required test : HIV Type 1 2 Antibodies [ AntiHIV1 , 2 ] ) , and/or Syphilis . . Tests perform certified/authorized test laboratory use licensed/approved test perform blood sample collect within 30 day prior muscle tissue procurement . 3 . Can , willing , maintain current treatment regimen exist conservative therapy ( e.g. , swallow therapy ) . 4 . Requires prophylactic antibiotic chronic infection , require 2 course antibiotic infection 2 month prior sign consent . 5 . Any condition , include current infection , could lead significant postoperative complication . 6 . Refuses provide write informed consent . 7 . Not available , willing comply , baseline followup evaluation require CIP . 8 . Pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course study .</criteria>
