	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Recombinant Humanized Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This mono-center , open-label , phase 1 study evaluate humanize anti-PD-1 antibody JS001 , monotherapy patient triple negative breast cancer fail previous routine systemic treatment . The study conduct 2 part : dose escalation cohort expansion . In first part , nine patient injected different dosage humanize anti-PD-1 antibody ( 1mg/kg 3mg/kg 10mg/mg , three patient one group ) observe carefully follow 4 week . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) occur , inject every 2 week disease progress unacceptable toxicity occur . This part confirm DLT , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose ( RD ) . In second part , 6-12 patient enrolled dosage group inject humanize anti-PD-1 antibody every 2 week disease progress unacceptable toxicity occur . This part analyze safety efficacy humanize anti-PD-1 antibody .</detailed_description>
