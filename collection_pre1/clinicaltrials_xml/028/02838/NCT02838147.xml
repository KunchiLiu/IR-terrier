	<detailed_description>Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) define carbohydrate intolerance first diagnose pregnancy [ 1 ] . It associate adverse pregnancy outcome mother , fetus consequence regard future health development neonate . Maternal consequence include increased rate operative cesarean delivery , hypertensive disorder pregnancy future risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) well aspects metabolic syndrome , obesity , cardiovascular morbidity recurrent GDM [ 2-4 ] . Also , child bear mother affect gestational hypertension find high body mass index ( BMI ) , systolic blood pressure , glucose insulin level [ 5 ] ; risk extend adulthood , 8-fold increase risk type 2 diabetes among young adult expose gestational diabetes fetal life [ 6 ] . Of type diabetes , GDM account approximately 90-95 % case [ 4 , 7 ] . It complicate 14 % pregnancy . Its prevalence increase parallel rise incidence type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide [ 3,4 ] . Risk factor develop GDM pregnancy include obesity , previously GDM , glycosuria , family history , ethnicity hypertension [ 5,6 ] . It clearly demonstrate intensified management achievement establish level glycemic control use memory-based self-monitoring blood glucose , glyburide treatment need multiple injection insulin , diet , interdisciplinary team effort associate enhanced pregnancy outcome [ 8-10 ] . The recommendation support routine use self-monitoring blood glucose management pregnancy compromise diabetes . The recommendation American Colleague Obstetrics Gynecology recently publish [ 11 ] four-times daily glucose monitoring preform fast either 1 2 hour meal possible modification make diet-controlled GDM patient reach well control glucose level . The role self-monitoring blood glucose intensify therapy non-pregnant pregnant woman become standard achieve target level glycemic control . Yet , self-monitoring blood glucose may disadvantage . It painful perform . Another shortcoming use reflectance meter glucose determination represent sole glucose value day , `` snap shot '' glucose value . Recently , several company attempt develop new technology measure continuous glucose . Some technique non-invasive others minimally invasive . Continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) employ four different approach : transdermal , glucose electrode , micro-dialysis open-flow micro perfusion . Currently , two commercially available . The transdermal approach ( Glucowatch ; Cygnus , CA , USA ) employ reverse iontophoresis apply low voltage current skin surface cause interstitial fluid ( contain glucose ) pas skin [ 12 ] . Glucose measure oxidase reaction . This data also contain information skin temperature sweat include calculation process . The MiniMed CGM System ( Sylmar , CA , USA ) compose disposable subcutaneous glucose-sensing device electrode impregnate glucose oxidase connect cable lightweight monitor wear clothing belt [ 13 ] . The system measure glucose level every 10 second , base electrochemical detection glucose reaction glucose oxidase , store average value every 5 minute , total 288 measurement per day . The glucose measurement perform subcutaneous tissue interstitial glucose level range 40-400 mg/dl . The data store monitor later download review personal computer . The patient unaware result sensor measurement monitor period . Glucose value obtain CGMS show correlate laboratory measurement plasma glucose level [ 14 ] home glucose meter value [ 15 ] . The CGMS study non-pregnant patient demonstrate clinical usefulness enhance decision-making detect previously unrecognized postprandial hyperglycemia nocturnal hyper-and hypoglycemia [ 16 ] . Scientific evidence HbA1c-reducing effect CGMS use limit [ 17 , 18 ] . Although study evaluate effect CGMS use biochemical endpoint , HbA1c level , data clinical endpoint like diabetic complication , lack . The usefulness CGMS use pregnancy hardly evaluate [ 18 ] . There limited randomize clinical trial assess usefulness CGMS reduce rate diabetes related pregnancy complication conflict result [ 19 , 20 ] . Murphy et al . [ 19 ] show 71 pregnant woman Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus intermittent ( 4-6 week interval ) CGMS result significant reduction HbA1C 32-36 week gestation , low birth weight , reduce risk macrosomia ( odds ratio 0.36 , 95 % confidence interval 0.13 0.98 , P &lt; 0.05 ) compare standard antenatal care . However , study hamper small sample size study group differ composition ( e.g . 5 set twin intervention group oppose none control group ) . In contrast , recently publish study [ 20 ] 154 pregnant woman preexist diabetes mellitus randomize either real time CGM 6 day 8,12,21,27 33 week gestation routine care show neither improvement glycemic control , reflect similar rate hypoglycemia event HbA1C level , reduction large gestational age neonate rate CGM group . In recent study , Wei et al . include total 106 woman GDM gestational week 24-28 randomly allocate antenatal care plus CGMS group self-monitoring blood glucose group [ 21 ] . The author show The proportion GDM woman excessive gestational weight gain low CGMS group self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) group ( 33.3 % vs. 56.4 % , P=0.039 ) , woman initiate CGMS earlier gain less weight ( P=0.017 ) . In addition , investigator show mode blood glucose monitoring ( adjust OR 2.40 ; 95 % CI 1.030-5.588 ; P=0.042 ) independent factor weight gain . Since obstetric complication diabetic pregnancy , especially macrosomia large gestational age newborn , seem relate glycemic control , investigator hypothesize additional use reduce adverse pregnancy outcome related pregnancy complicate gestational diabetes . Aims : This trial evaluate clinical effectiveness , cost cost-effectiveness Continuous glucose monitor use FreeStyle Freedom Lite CGMS use aim optimize glycemic control pregnancy outcome pregnancy diagnose GDM relative standard control method .</detailed_description>
