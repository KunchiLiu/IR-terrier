	<brief_title>Preoperative Nutrition With Immune Enhancing Nutritional Supplement ( Immunomodulation )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : The primary objective study determine optimal effective dose preoperative nutritional supplementation immunomodulators immune function perioperative outcome follow pancreaticoduodenectomy pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Primary Endpoints : The primary endpoint effect immunological profile ( circulate Myeloid derive suppressor cell , circulate B cell , NK cell , CD4 CD8 cell ) , serum arginine level , immunological milieu tumor ( tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ) , overall morbidity rate infectious complication rate . Secondary Endpoints : - Monitor Safety Tolerability - Hospital Length Stay - Readmission rate - One-year event free survival - Effect nutritional parameter ( serum total protein , prealbumin , albumin transferrin ) - Effect acute phase reactant ( CRP , IL6 , TNF alpha ) Study Design : This 1:1:1:1 four-arm single center prospective randomize feasibility study compare preoperative nutritional supplementation enhance formula contain immune-modulating agent ( IMPACT AR ) 5 day 1,2 3 can versus 5 day 3 can comparable iso-caloric iso-nitrogenous supplementation ( Boost ) patient resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Number Patients 20 ( 5 arm ) Eligibility Criteria : Patients 18 year age , histologic and/or radiologic evidence pancreatic adenocarcinoma head pancreas , deem resectable , able give inform consent , eligible Exclusion criterion would include Active uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection within 21 day study entry OR Inability take oral , nasojejunal jejunostomy tube nutritional supplement OR patient chronic steroid therapy ( i.e . great 3 month ) Nutritional Supplement intervention : Patients randomized TEST intervention receive Impact Advanced Recovery™ formula , commercially available oral nutrition supplement drink supply 237mL container . Each serve provide 1.4 kcal/mL ( 340 kcal/serving ) 22 % kcal derive protein ( 18.1 gm protein/serving ) , addition regular diet . Patients randomize CONTROL Boost® High Protein Drink consume regular diet 4 can Boost per day 5 day preoperatively ( maintain equivalent supplementation term calorie protein group receive high dose Impact AR ) . Study procedure : Screening/baseline assessment perform prior first treatment within approximately four week treatment include detailed medical history physical examination , standard Care Laboratory test ( CBC , CMP ) , tumor marker : indicate : CEA CA19-9 ; coagulation ( baseline clinically indicate ) : INR , PTT , PT . Imaging confirm respectability would include high quality tri-phasic CT scan 0.7mm cut Dynamic MRI contrast confirm absence metastatic disease Study specific test include pre-treatment post treatment ( Office visit/ pre-anesthesia visit , Morning surgery , postop day 5 ) - Nutritional parameter acute phase reactant : serum prealbumin , albumin , transferrin , CRP , IL6 , TNF alpha - Serum arginine , - MSDC ( myeloid derive suppressor cell ) assay fresh blood Arginase I expression Study procedure time surgery : Semi-quantitative assay Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte tissue block tumor obtain time surgery . Tumor tissue also bank post hoc test need . During follow visit history physical examination , performance Status evaluation Standard care Laboratory Tests ( CBC , CMP , Tumor Marker Assessment clinically indicate per discretion investigator would do approximately every three month ) . Imaging follow include CT/MRI disease status ( approximately every three month follow-up ) Adverse Event Monitoring Concomitant Medication monitor do 90 day</detailed_description>
