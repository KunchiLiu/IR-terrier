	<brief_summary>About 15 % 30 % patient venous leg ulcer peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) associate . The compression band still controversial issue context . It allow reduction venous hypertension edema , could potentially degrade arterial infusion high level compression . The French High Authority Health ( HAS ) define mixed ulcer IPS 0.5 0.9 . Investigators distinguish mixed ulcer blood predominance IPS 0.5 0.7 ; mixed ulcer predominantly venous blood moderate involvement IPS value 0.7 0.9 . Several study show IPS &gt; 0.8 allow high compression , 30 40 mmHg . In case mixed ulcer IPS 0.6 0.8 , HAS recommend use light compression , bit elastic band ( exercise low power compression rest ) medical supervision , inform patient remove bandage pain aggravation . It therefore necessary adapt compression therapy case venous ulcer associate arterial disease provide low compression 30 mmHg short stretch . For HAS , IPS &lt; 0.6 indicate compression . A recent study show compression bit elastic band could improve venous return , would also increase distal arterial flow patient population mixed ulcer . In study , 25 patient IPS 0.5 0.8 ; certain patient threshold 0.6 indicates compression accord HAS . To knowledge study examined effect compression blood perfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : - Principal : Study distal arterial infusion patient population mixed ulcer compression leg little elastic band - Secondary : To evaluate safety little compression elastic band mixed population patient leg ulcer Methodology : - Study non-interventional prospective single-center evaluate professional practice 25 patient mixed leg ulcer follow vascular medicine department St. Joseph Hospital Group Paris . - Applying bit compression elastic bandage pressure level 30 40mmHg . - Anonymous data report grid standardize collection , number system 1 30 captured computer file - Age , risk factor cardiovascular history patient , - Age , ulcer description - Palpation pulse - morphological vascular profile patient arterial venous Doppler dating less year , - Series follow data installation , 10 minute application 24 hour installation inelastic compression : Evaluation tolerance : - measurement pain numeric scale ( NS ) - description skin condition leg dermatologist , seek sign suffer skin application compression : possible appearance erythema , cyanosis , purpura . A search particularly area bony prominence bank ulcer . distal arterial pressure compression carrier leg : - IPS ( systolic pressure index ) : ankle arm pressure measure cuff continuous Doppler . GPI calculate divide low pressure ankle ( dorsalis pedis posterior tibial artery ) humeral pressure . - Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure ( TcPO2 ) Measuring pressure exert low elastic bandage KikuhimeÂ® system . In case bad tolerance compression time installation , compression remove study stop patient question . Poor tolerance define increase pain equal 2 point digital scale . expect benefit patient : - Demonstration good tolerance , define worsen skin condition lack increase pain associate inelastic compression . - Demonstration worsen arterial infusion inelastic compression . - Evidence improve distal arterial hemodynamics ( increase IPS tcpO2 ) little elastic compression , validate result study ever conduct subject .</detailed_description>
