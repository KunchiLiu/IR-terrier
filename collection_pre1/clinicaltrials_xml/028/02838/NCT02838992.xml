	<brief_title>ATG Combined With Cyclophosphamide And Cord Blood Transfusion Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aplastic Anemia ( AA ) , set bone marrow hematopoietic dysfunction cause variety cause , hyperplasia bone marrow hematopoietic cell reduce whole blood cell peripheral blood characteristic clinical main performance anemia , bleed infection . According severity bone marrow failure progress clinical course , divide Severe Aplastic Anemia ( SAA ) Non - Severe Aplastic Anemia ( NSAA ) .Severe Aplastic Anemia divide two category : Very Severe Aplastic Anemia ( VSAA ) Severe Aplastic Anemia ( SAA ) , characteristic rapid progress , refractory , poor prognosis , high mortality .The natural course six month , patient die year . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation immunosuppressive therapy two main treatment . The former far possible cure . It recommend first-line treatment , patient match sibling donor . The recommended age limit 40 year old . But sibling donor patient older 40 year old , recommend immunosuppressive therapy . The investigator already summarize effectiveness rabbit antithymocyte immunoglobulin ( ATG ) , cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) cyclosporine , A ( CsA ) combination umbilical cord blood infusion SAA/VSAA patient without suitable donor , short duration , without long-term immunosuppressive therapy history . The total effectiveness rate improve 88 % , short immunosuppressive maintaining therapy , rapid hematopoietic reconstruction , few complication . The aim study explore whether solution accelerate hematopoietic reconstruction SAA/VSAA patient clinical curative effect security . This study scheme approve Jinan military region general hospital medical ethic committee .</detailed_description>
