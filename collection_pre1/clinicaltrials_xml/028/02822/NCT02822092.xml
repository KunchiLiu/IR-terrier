	<brief_summary>This observational neuroimaging treatment study . This study involve examine neural circuitry control treatment patient present first-episode psychosis risperidone . Patients present treatment first psychotic episode schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis eligible undergo treatment risperidone offer participation study . Clinical rating , neuropsychological testing , neuroimaging EEG conduct baseline . Additionally , subject undergo assessment week 12 determine treatment-related biomarkers . Clinical rating , include neurocognitive testing , conduct blind raters study visit treatment . Healthy control ( N=50 ) also recruit scanned twice ( 12-week interval ) control effect time practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In propose study , study examine treatment-related effect functional brain circuitry first episode schizophrenia . Converging line evidence suggest key role striatal disconnectivity pathophysiology psychosis . The propose study utilize rest state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs-fMRI ) , well fMRI task derive Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) framework , : 1 ) develop validate prognostic biomarker predict antipsychotic treatment response ; 2 ) model underlie neural circuitry change associate state change psychotic symptomatology . As prognostic biomarker , neuroimaging assay striatal connectivity potentially provide clinically useful tool advance goal precision medicine . As longitudinal index symptom change , model serve objective index measure potential efficacy newly develop antipsychotic treatment . A large , well-characterized cohort patient present first episode active psychosis ( regardless DSM diagnosis ) recruit , along match control . The study utilize two well-validated fMRI task capture two portion positive valence system : probabilistic category learn reward responsiveness ; task design interrogate dorsal ventral corticostriatal circuit , respectively . The design longitudinal , two scanning session perform patient : baseline , 12 week treatment . Treatment standardized across patient reduce potential confounds , healthy control also scan baseline 12 week order control effect time practice . Level psychotic symptomatology ( hallucination , delusion , think disorder ) measure regular interval use comprehensive battery rating scale . As secondary measure , electroencephalography ( EEG ) perform coincide neuroimaging subset patient provide consent . We utilize Kaplan-Meier estimator hierarchical linear model examine association baseline striatal connectivity , change connectivity time , clinical response psychotic symptom antipsychotic treatment . Deliverables include baseline longitudinal biomarkers subsequently test broad , heterogeneous population patient psychosis .</detailed_description>
