	<brief_summary>High dietary phosphate intake general population associate high risk develop kidney disease cardiovascular disease increase overall mortality . Whereas effect high phosphate intake general health become clearer , almost nothing known underlying mechanism . More recently , investigator others find animal model FGF23 stimulate renal NaCl cotransporter NCC , target thiazide diuretic , increase NCC activity may increase blood pressure . The investigator could also show increase dietary phosphate intake mouse , increase FGF23 NCC activity within 3 day . Thus , objective single-centre observational cross-over study include 20-45 year old healthy male probands elucidate role dietary phosphate blood pressure regulation renal handling sodium chloride healthy subject . Further impact dietary phosphate intake regulation phosphaturic hormone factor regulation blood pressure investigate . In addition , investigator examine whether phosphate intake modulates gut microbiome composition . The primary outcome study change blood pressure healthy subject low-phosphate diet compare healthy subject high-phosphate diet . In addition , ass change NCC activity main mechanism phosphate-sensitive blood pressure regulation , renal sodium chloride excretion administration hydrochlorothiazide measure . The secondary outcome study : change renal phosphate , calcium potassium excretion , change phosphate regulation hormone 25-OH-Vit . D , 1,25- ( OH ) 2-Vit . D , PTH , FGF23 , dopamine plasma urine , change plasma urinary aldosterone level , change sodium/chloride-cotransporter NCC NaPi-IIa assess urinary exosomes , change stool phosphate excretion gut microbiome composition .</brief_summary>
