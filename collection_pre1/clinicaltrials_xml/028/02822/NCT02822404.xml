	<detailed_description>Cisplatin ifosfamide commonly use drug chemotherapy . They know involve renal toxic threat child give immature kidney . This toxicity increase especially nephrectomy and/or concomitant radiotherapy . In pediatric oncology , evaluation renal function carry accord clinical trial protocol center practice . To date , standard method ( eg . creatinine clearance ) , well available predictive formula ( eg . Schwartz formula ) well adapt monitor child renal function . Indeed , reliability method depend several parameter diet muscle mass could restrictive perform child . To circumvent practical difficulty , investigator intend use cystatin C biological marker renal toxicity child treat cisplatin / ifosfamide . This cysteine protease witness upsurge interest endogenous glomerular filtration rate marker could good candidate ass tubular toxicity measure urine . This study aim describe kinetic appearance urinary cystatin C explore propriety early cost-effective marker glomerular tubular renal toxicity child . In addition , method could allow enhance calculation model routinely use glomerular filtration rate .</detailed_description>
