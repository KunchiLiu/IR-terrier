	<brief_title>Relation Between Emotional Stress Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many speculation regard decline human fecundity believe related environmental factor , include life style . Among many factor , perceive psychological stress suggest alter male female fertility . There many way ass stress , one do filling questionnaire . DASS-21 , 21-item questionnaire , set three self-report scale ( Depression , anxiety , stress scale ) . The negative emotional state depression , anxiety stress measure use DASS21 . Each three DASS scale contain 7 item . Each item rat four-point scale severity . By use DASS scale , stress anxiety level subject monitor different situation life . Another way asses stress do measure peptide secrete acute chronic stress , one cortisol . Cortisol glucocorticoid class steroid hormone ; produce human zona fasciculate adrenal cortex within adrenal gland . It quantify marker hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis reactivity . In human , cortisol level increase stress , depression , select systemic disease Cushing 's syndrome well response low blood-glucose concentration well response psychosocial stress . The experience chronic adversity stress well-known associate range negative effect health . A crucial neuroendocrine axis involve mediating effect hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis lead secretion glucocorticoid cortisol . Measurement long-term endogenous production cortisol do take urine , saliva serum sample , measurement advantage limitation . All method require multiple sample provide assessment cortisol level prolong period time important note measure reflect acutely circulate cortisol level integrate cortisol secretion examine sampling period . Another aspect acute cortisol level fluctuates markedly depend many factor circadian rhythmicity , acute stress , cigarettes smoking , alcohol , exercise . Another strategy measure cortisol repeat sample different time day several day . But , order strategy effective , large number sample point day need . Taking together , real assessment long term cortisol secretion difficult , thus new technique develop use hair . Positive association hair cortisol accumulate salivary free cortisol see , conclude hair cortisol reflect long term cortisol secretion . In infertile couple come evaluation face stressful time cause even reduction fecundity , investigator measure long term cortisol secretion understand effect stress cortisol infertile couple .</detailed_description>
