	<brief_summary>The present clinical trial perform field vascular surgery . The aim study economical clinical comparison two different access way femoral artery intention endovascular repair aortic aneurysm . The usual access surgical cutdown femoral artery compare percutaneous access close via suture mediate device ( Perclose ProGlide , Abbott ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Economic Comparison Percutaneous ( pEVAR ) vs. Open Access EVAR .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Endovascular repair aortic aneurysm ( EVAR ) routine procedure vascular surgery associate less perioperative complication compare open aortic repair . Continuous improvement endovascular technique crucial sufficient patient care , especially elderly serious comorbidities . Percutaneous access ( pEVAR ) femoral artery associate less wound complication perform suitable patient . Prospective data economic feasibility exact duration technique compare open access surgery miss . Methods data collection : The primary endpoint prospective randomise single center trial cost time difference open vs. percutaneous access . Each Patient enrol study receive percutaneous one side surgical access side groin femoral artery access . The punction site close use Perclose ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System manufacture Abbott Vascular . This device work stiff wire guide deliver monofilament suture femoral artery punction site . After finish endovascular procedure aneurysm repair , thereby lay suture tighten achieve hemostasis . This system suitable sheath size 21 F ( .28 inch ) . Open access side perform cutdown femoral artery closure finish procedure , polypropylene suture . Patients undergo endovascular aortic repair Department Vascular Surgery Wilhelminenspital Vienna recruit study inform consent fulfil inclusion criterion . Included men woman age 18 - 90 year indication endovascular aneurysm repair ( thoracic , infrarenal aortic iliac artery aneurysm , combination ) . Indication aneurysm repair part study set accordance international guideline . Women childbearing year could include detailed explanation special risk pregnancy EVAR proof negative pregnancy test . Exclusion criterion occlusive aortic disease , aneurysm femoral artery , diameter &lt; 5mm severe calcification , patient keloided inguinal site , adipositas per magna demented patient . Due prior power analysis optimum number 50 case determine . Randomization perform lot ( patient draw envelope contain either leave right side do pEVAR ) . Data collect preoperatively case report form ( CRF ) include detailed health information patient . During surgery , femoral artery access wound closure time measure separately side ( minute ) . Material cost also document separately side ( â‚¬ ) . Postoperative data wound heal pain inguinal side collect descriptive use CRF . Data management analysis anonymous use random patient number form . Main target study cost time difference percutaneous open access technique . Possible difference group analyze use Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test . Postoperative data evaluate descriptively . In case cost advantage percutaneous access , study economically legitimate use suture mediate closure system therefore contribute establishment minimally invasive endovascular aortic repair .</detailed_description>
