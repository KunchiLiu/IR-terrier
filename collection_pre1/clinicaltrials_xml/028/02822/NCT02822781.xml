	<brief_title>Chronic Rhinosinusitis Classification Proposal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) debilitate disease remain ( smell , nasal patency , flow ) currently treatment protocol available u limited efficacy . For many year , practitioner try identify universal therapeutic protocol . It turn treatment ( functional endoscopic surgery , antifungal therapy , medical treatment antibiotic / corticosteroid ) resolve symptom effectiveness variable one patient another . The plausible explanation term `` rhinosinusitis '' include various different pathophysiological mechanism entity , require different treatment . Like certain skin lung disease , chronic inflammation sinus may different origin , allergic extrinsic ( infectious ) . It therefore important determine type inflammation responsible adapt management . First , important determine form CRS ( without polyp ) , associate allergic inflammation infectious one . The presence absence polyp appear determine factor type inflammation . However , criterion - allergy asthma - could provide guidance allergic mechanism . The study aim distinguish different phenotype CRS accord clinical , anatomical criterion biological criterion . Clinical classification obtain would assess predict finely treatment response target accord phenotype , best support . Surgery one therapeutic option treatment rhinosinusitis , term satisfaction heal patient comfort variable , finer precise distribution patient allow u good predict success surgery therefore offer targeted patient . Primary objective : To assess response surgical treatment rhinosinusitis outcome patient order highlight predictor success surgery . Secondary objective : Assess chronic rhinosinusitis phenotype score SNOT 22 ( importance symptom ) assess average severity different group Assessing future non-operated patient</detailed_description>
