	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Study H3N2 M2SR Monovalent Influenza Vaccine Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy adult subject screen objective randomize 96 subject low level H3 hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) titer meet inclusion/exclusion criterion sign informed consent . Subjects rank order low high base HAI titer . Subjects assign treatment base randomization either active vaccine placebo . The first two subject dose dose cohort serve sentinel receive active IP ( randomize ) . Subjects receive single dose inoculation H3N2 M2SR seasonal monovalent influenza vaccine administer intranasally liquid formulation , placebo ( saline ) . The sentinel subject vaccinate dose cohort 1 safety monitoring committee ( SMC ) conduct review safety data , tolerability , reactogenicity , clearance infectious virus prior dose remain subject cohort active placebo . After last subject cohort follow least 7 day SMC conduct another review safety data prior proceed next high dose level : Cohort 2 . The process sentinel subject dose SMC review conduct Cohorts 2 3 .</detailed_description>
