	<brief_summary>Orofacial impairment follow stroke frequently involve reduced chew performance dysphagia . This study investigate sensitivity oral tissue follow stroke potential impact chew efficiency . The following two Null-hypotheses ( H0 ) test : i. Post-stroke patient show reduce intra-oral sensitivity compare healthy control . ii . Intra-oral sensitivity correlate chew efficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Tactile Sensitivity Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material Methods : Ethical approval grant ( Psy11-259 , Psy 11-032 ) write informed consent obtain participant and/or legal guardian . Patients screen recruited Division Neurorehabilitation , Department Clinical Neurosciences , University Hospital University Geneva , Geneva , Switzerland senior consultant neurologist ( BL ) . Patients include hospitalized stroke rehabilitation , able undergo psychophysical testing present facial impairment accord House-Brackmann criterion ≥2 15 . They exclude present acute pain oro-facial sphere ( nominal question ) additional neuro-muscular disease . For experiment , in-depth oral examination perform number functional premolar unit ( OU ) note . A premolar tooth occlude antagonist count one OU whereas molar consider two OU ( include third molar ) . Participants ask simple dichotomic question perceive dry mouth . Food-hoarding Food-hoarding assess ordinal Likert scale . Participants ask currently `` lose '' foodstuff oral vestibule : Never ( score 0 ) , rarely ( score1 ) , occasionally ( score2 ) , frequently ( score 3 ) , frequently ( score 4 ) always ( score 5 ) . Maximum voluntary bite force Maximum voluntary Bite Force ( MBF ) assess mean Occlusal Force-Meter GM 10® ( Nagano Keiki , Higashimagome , Ohta-ku , Tokyo , Japan ) , 8.6 mm thick bite element . The gauge place in-between first molar participant ask bite three time hard possible three second . The MBF test independently right leave side . For analysis , peak MBF side note . Maximum voluntary lip force For lip force measurement oral screen ( Dentaurum `` Ulmer Modell `` maxi , DENTAURUM GmbH &amp; Co.KG , Ispringen , Germany ) connect Dynamometer ( ZP50-N , IMADA , Toyohashi , Japan ) . It place anterior oral vestibule horizontal pull force apply whilst participant try withstand force long possible . Per size , three peak recording average analysis . Tactile detection thresholds The tactile detection threshold ( TDT ) mechanoreceptors evaluate use psychophysical test method . A touch sensation elicit use von Frey filament ( OptiHair , MARSTOCK nerv test , Schriesheim , Germany ) 16 . This test kit consist 11 monofilaments vary stiffness , calibrate apply define force 0.25 - 512 mN ( ±10 % ) . The filament push vertically 1 second different test site side ( ipsi- contra-lesional stroke-patients right- left side control ) . The test start supra-threshold stimulus , consecutively lower patient feel filament anymore . Following filament low perceived pressure , apply force re-increased patient recognize touch . This procedure repeat twice session find threshold stair-case-method . The final threshold calculate mean three infra- three supra-thresholds . If patient felt even low stimulus available ( 0.25mN ) , infra-threshold set 0.125mN . Two-point discrimination To determine patient ' tactile spatial resolution , static two-point discrimination threshold ( 2PD ) investigate 17 . The small distance two simultaneously present punctiform stimulus evaluate use medical calliper ( Schieblehre Zürcher Modell , 125mm , Hammacher Instrumente , Germany ) . The separation two tip range 0 15 mm ; cut-off set 15 mm . A staircase method use descend distance . The participant ask indicate whether he/ sense one two point correspond distance note . The mean two distance consider individual minimum 2PD . The 2PD test sit extraoral surface lip ( approximately half way philtrum oral commissure ) dorsum tongue oppose second premolar . For TDT , mucosa cheek oppose second premolar linea alba use additional test site . Whereas test site evaluate side , 2PD test additionally apply tip tongue without side discrimination . For one particular analysis TDT reading per participant average ( TDT.global ) . Chewing efficiency Chewing efficiency assess previously develop validate colour-mixing ability test , bolus-kneading test , use chew gum 18 . The specimen use study develop produced 8020 Promotion Foundation ( Japan ) specifically assess masticatory performance research setting ( Lotte™ , Tokyo ) similar originally describe method 19 . The gum compose two individually pack bead ( pink azure colour ) similar hardness Shore Scale OO , Ø 2.4 mm , 1.11 N , pink bead : mean depth indentation 0.2±0.01mm , mean Durometer 93.7 ; azure bead mean depth indentation 0.1±0.02mm , mean Durometer 95.1 ) . The two bead manually stick together dimension 18.8x14.2x3.9 mm ; place participant 's tongue . The task chew specimen twenty cycle whilst monitor operator ( ED ) . The gum bolus retrieve oral cavity , place plastic bag , press 1 mm thick wafer side scan 300dpi ( Epson Perfection V750 Pro , Seiko Epson Corp. , Japan ) . The compound image side subject colourimetric evaluation use custom-built software ViewGum© ( dHAL Software , Greece , www.dhal.com ) . The software transpose image HSI colour space calculates hue value pixel picture semi-automatically segment gum wafer . If colour mixed , two well-separated peak hue axis present gradually converge increase colour mixture . `` Hue '' angle HSI colour space , thus circular variance hue define 1 minus length average vector . ViewGum© display standard deviation colour peak take square root : SD = sqrt ( Variance Hue ) 20 . For consistency , term Variance Hue ( VOH ) use 18 ; consider measure chew performance context test - low VOH indicate high colour mixture therefore well chew efficiency . Statistical analysis Normality numerical variable reject empirical cumulative distribution function QQ-plots . Therefore , result report median value ± standard deviation . The two group ( stroke , control ) compare exact Wilcoxon- , Mann-Whitney-tests numerical data Fisher 's exact test categorical data . Numerical linear regression model compute analyse impact investigate parameter VOH . The relationship variable numerical end-point measure Spearman correlation coefficient correlation test . In case binary variable end-point transform categorical variable separate value median . Odds Ratios OR 95 % Confidence Intervals ( 95 % CI ) calculate analyse result 2x2 contingency table . All statistical test perform R 3.2.2 ( R Project Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) senior bio-statistician .</detailed_description>
