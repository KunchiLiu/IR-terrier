	<brief_title>Uterine Artery Spiral Artery Doppler Parameters Patients With Postmenopausal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective Cross-sectional Observational study conduct Department Obstetrics Gynecology , Banha University , Egypt period start January 2014 . The study protocol approve Local Ethics Committee write informed consent obtain patient study commence . Seventy patient postmenopausal bleed include study verbal consent . They recruit patient attend gynecologic clinic Banha University hospital . All patient subject following : For included woman follow do : 1 . Full history take . 2 . Complete general , abdominal , local examination . 3 . Ultrasonographic assessment uterus All data perform patient lithotomy position empty bladder use 7.5 megahertz transducer single operator . 1 . Using colour Doppler 2D mode , flow velocity waveform obtain ascend main branch uterine artery right leave side cervix longitudinal plane enter uterus . 2 . The gate Doppler position vessel good colour signal identify screen . Pulsatility index uterine artery calculate electronically similar consecutive waveform good quality obtain average uterine PI . Pulsatility index ( PI ) : This index , also know mean pulsatility index , distinguish peak peak pulsatility index , express : PI= ( S-D ) / Mean Where S peak systolic velocity , D end diastolic velocity velocity time average maximum velocity cardiac cycle ( 1 ) . 3 . Blood flow velocity waveform evaluate spiral artery sub endometrial region within 1 mm originally define myometrial-endometrial contour ( 2 ) . Histopathological diagnosis endometrium obtain biopsy gold standard diagnosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Endometrial thickness â‰¥ 5 mm measure twodimensional transvaginal ultrasound . 2 . Pap smear negative malignancy . 1 . Postmenopausal woman hormon replacement therapy . 2 . Transvaginal examination possible ( Vaginal stenosis patient refuse transvaginal ultrasound ) . 3 . Adnexal pathology . 4 . General cause bleed e.g : Hemophilia , anticoagulation therapy</criteria>
