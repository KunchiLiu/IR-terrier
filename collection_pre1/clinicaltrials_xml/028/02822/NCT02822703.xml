	<brief_summary>Tobacco use one significant cancer control public health challenge US today . Half smoker US attempt quit tobacco year , fully 95 % attempt quit reverse decision within 12 month choose transient , albeit immediately reward activity smoke cost much large long-term reward future health long life . This project seek improve scientific knowledge decision-making process potentially improve treatment tobacco dependence examine feasibility use brain stimulation technique , repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation rTMS improve efficacy exist evidence-based relapse prevention intervention . rTMS FDA-cleared treatment medication resistant depression examine treatment variety disorder . This study utilize intensity duration rTMS well within safety parameter similar location intensity use previous study smoker reduce cigarette consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Relapse Prevention Smoking Cessation With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project seek improve scientific knowledge decision-making process smoker improve tobacco dependence treatment . The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) influence decision-making integrate inhibitory mechanism emotionally charge information limbic region , thereby exert inhibitory influence seductive , immediately reward option long-term cost , smoke . Delay discount degree one de-values delay outcome , future health long life . Converging evidence indicate choose delay option large reward associate increased activity DLPFC . This study propose choose smoke make decision quit reflect situation DLPFC insufficiently activate exert inhibitory influence immediately reward option smoking . Preliminary study indicate stimulation DLPFC 20 Hz high frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) reduce delay discounting ( i.e. , cause individual choose delayed , high value option ) ; reduce cigarette consumption smoker intend quit ; improve executive function , learning , memory , attention ; promising adjunct cognitive-behavioral treatment disorder ; likely improve efficacy exist cognitive-behavioral treatment tobacco dependence . The goal study make inform recommendation , base measure feasibility , whether intervention test efficacy . A double blind , randomize between-subjects treatment ( active sham ) design employ subject expose relapse prevention material rTMS stimulation . Aim 1 : Examine feasibility combine high frequency rTMS evidence-based , self-help , cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention intervention use multiple feasibility indicator ( demand , acceptability , practicality , limited-efficacy testing , adequate blinding ) . Aim 2 : Examine difference delay discount active sham condition 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 week quit day . Aim 3 : Use latency relapse comparison calculate estimate effect size intervention abstinence .</detailed_description>
