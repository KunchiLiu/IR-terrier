	<brief_summary>Alcohol misuse affect 5 million people France . Even though elderly also concerned pathology , much information chronic alcohol misuse population particular . Biological marker like gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ( GGT ) , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) carbohydrate deficient transferrin ( CDT ) usually use detect alcohol abuse . As biological marker alcohol misuse , specificity CDT know superior GGT well . However , come elderly , alcoholism diagnosis tool base research young population . This study aim evaluate benefit CDT detect chronic alcohol use elderly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefit Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin Detect Chronic Alcohol Abuse Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Problematic alcohol misuse frequent tend decrease age . According French Alcohology Society , 10 % adult population alcohol abstinent 65 year old , 40 % abstain alcohol . On hand , French Alcohology Society also report regular daily alcohol consumption old people increase risk dependence alcohol . For elderly , biological disorder related polymedication condition related age process , make difficult diagnose alcoholism age people . For study , three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT-C ) submit : - every patient admit Hospital Mulhouse ( France ) least day Geriatrics Department - every patient enter General Practitioner Support Association Alsace , France ( translate French `` RAG '' ) . When score AUDIT-C reach least 1 point , study collect result GGT MCV perform routine practice add CDT blood test .</detailed_description>
