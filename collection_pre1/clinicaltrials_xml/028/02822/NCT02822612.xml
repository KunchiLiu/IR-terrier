	<brief_summary>Ophthalmology among technology driven medical specialty , advance medical imaging device - specialise computer software - increasingly adopt routine clinical use . While many device capable complete specific task , lack `` usability '' prevents widespread adoption ( i.e. , device easy learn remember , efficient subjectively please use ) . Moreover , device difficult use expose patient clinical risk result human error usage . With introduction new medical technology , essential , therefore , deep understanding patient , need , value , ability , also limitation . Human factor usability testing , also know `` human factor engineering '' , deal formal study people 's interaction environment ( case , binocular OCT device ) . Structured , patient-centred , usability test essential design , clinical validation , regulatory approval , widespread implementation , new medical device . This particularly case putative binocular OCT system - device intend automate use visually impaired , often elderly , population . Although binocular OCT already advance stage hardware development , EASE study facilitate iterative process operate software workflow modification optimize device use population .</brief_summary>
