	<brief_summary>Postmenopausal woman often seek non-pharmacologic intervention protection bone health . Previous research human rodent indicate dietary dry plum consumption may beneficial bone health , especially postmenopausal woman . However , unknown quantity dry plum need consume benefit mechanism dry plum act impact bone health . Therefore , purpose study evaluate impact 52 week dry plums consumption vary quantity bone mineral density ( BMD ) , bone geometry , estimate bone strength postmenopausal woman . The investigator also seek evaluate mechanism underlie effect dry plum dietary supplement assess polyphenols bioavailable conjugate metabolite urine postmenopausal woman take different dos dietary dry plum . The investigator aim investigate mechanism dry plum action bone measure marker bone metabolism response dry plum consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given current high incidence osteoporosis , reduce risk osteoporosis development essential . Recent estimate , base 2010 US Census , indicate approximately 10.3 million people age 50 old osteoporosis . By 2030 prevalence osteoporosis woman 50 year older project reach 13.6 million . Postmenopausal osteoporosis characterize hypoestrogenism , also increase production reactive oxygen specie , oxidative stress , inflammatory response . Current first line strategy treatment osteoporosis pharmacologic approach . Complementary recommendation include maintenance calcium ( Ca2+ ) vitamin D ( VitD ) intake meet current recommendation . Although anti-resorptive therapy effective also associate array negative side effect , reduce patient compliance use therapy . Non-pharmacologic option reduce risk bone loss become attractive many postmenopausal woman . The phenolic bioavailable conjugated metabolite find dry plum propose modulate inflammatory signal pathway potential influence bone formation bone resorption , thus modulate risk bone loss . The investigator conduct 52 week dose range randomize control trial build upon previous rodent human work address experimental design limitation previous work , assess bone outcomes clinical ( BMD ) mechanistic ( bone geometry , bone metabolism marker , inflammation marker ) technique . Additionally , study include detailed assessment phenolic dry plum explore relationship compound bone outcome . Participants participate 1-2 week screen period follow 1-2 week baseline period . At end baseline randomization 1 3 group occur ( Ca2+ VitD ; 50g Dried Plums/day Ca2+ VitD ; 100g Dried Plums/day Ca2+ VitD ) . Dried plum Calcium/Vitamin D supplement provide participant duration intervention . At begin 52 week intervention participant begin consumption dry plum give run period number dry plum consume per day increase slowly minimize side effect felt participant . The dried plum consume snack morning , midday , even . Participants visit laboratory test every 4 week 52 week intervention , test occur week 12 , 24 , 36 , 52 test period . At test period visit participant ask complete following : body weight measurement ; blood sampling ; 24-hour urine collection ; stool sample collection ; DXA scan ; peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) scan ; completion health , physical activity , nutrition questionnaire ; completion supplement/symptom , diet , physical activity log . A total 300 participant enrol screed expect randomization 79 participant per group . The investigator anticipate 20 % drop-out rate baseline week 52 , thus anticipate final sample size 63 participant per group complete study . This sample size provide 80 % power detect difference primary BMD , bone geometry , bone strength variable .</detailed_description>
