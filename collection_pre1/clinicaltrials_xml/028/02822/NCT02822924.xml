	<detailed_description>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , non-malignant enlargement prostate , common condition among elderly men prevalence increase age . When sufficiently large , hyperplastic nodule compress urethral canal cause obstruction urethra interfere normal flow urine , lead symptom urinary hesitancy , frequent urination , increase risk urinary tract infection urinary retention . While medication often prescribe first treatment option , often adequately restore normal urine flow . Many patient treated medication may achieve sustain improvement symptom , may stop take medication side effect , therefore form treatment may necessary . Although surgery transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) benchmark BPH treatment , involve insertion endoscope insert penis , removal prostate piece piece . While consider safe technique mortality rate 0.25 % , without adverse event . The frequent complication ejaculatory disorder ( 80 % ) , early urinary incontinence ( 30 40 % ) , acute urinary retention cause blood clot ( 2 5 % ) , sexual impotence ( 5 % ) , need blood transfusion ( 0.4 7 % ) . Patients undergone TURP require surgical retreatment low urinary tract symptom 3 14.5 % case . Others include infection urethral stricture . Therefore TURP recommend complicate severe BPH due adverse effect . Prostatic artery embolization ( PAE ) potentially promising , minimally invasive alternative procedure BPH . Results early study show PAE might safe effective treatment BPH .</detailed_description>
