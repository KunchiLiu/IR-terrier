	<brief_title>TSEB Brentuximab Treatment Mycosis Fungoides &amp; Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 2-cohort , open-label , phase 1B trial evaluate cutaneous toxicity , overall toxicity , treatment response associate administer concurrent low-dose TSEB brentuximab vedotin patient mycosis fungoides Sézary Syndrome . Duration complete skin response , DOCB , tumor response lymph node blood also evaluate . Additionally , skin-related QOL neurotoxicity assess . Patients enrol 1 2 cohort base disease stage . Cohort A include patient earlier stage disease ( select Stage IB patient one previous course low-dose TSEB ) Stages IIA IIIA [ N0-1 ] ) . Cohort B include patient advanced disease ( Stage IIA IIIA [ N2-3 ] , Stage IIIB , Stage IVA , transform CTCL ) candidate low-dose TSEB and/or systemic therapy . A standard dose brentuximab vedotin administer patient intravenous infusion 3 week prior initiation low-dose TSEB every 3 week total 3 cycle . Cohort A patient complete brentuximab vedotin 3 cycle ; patient Cohort B continue brentuximab vedotin disease progression unacceptable toxicity , whichever occur first . In absence progression unacceptable toxicity , patient may receive brentuximab vedotin 2 year study participant . A total 12 Gy TSEB ( ie , low-dose TSEB ) administer cohort per standard protocol 6 fraction ( 2 fraction per week ) begin 3 week first dose brentuximab vedotin . The Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool ( mSWAT ) ( 16 ) , complete investigator , use determine skin involvement baseline skin response treatment begin administration 3 dos brentuximab vedotin low-dose TSEB . Skindex-16 , patient-completed form measure symptoms perception toxicity patient skin disease use assess skin-related QOL . Additionally , Form NTX complete patient Cohort A ass symptom CIPN side effect brentuximab vedotin . The sample size study maximum 15 patient total 12 evaluable patient 6 patient Cohort B . However , number patient severe toxicity exceeds establish acceptable incidence , accrual end reach sample size goal 12 evaluable patient .</detailed_description>
