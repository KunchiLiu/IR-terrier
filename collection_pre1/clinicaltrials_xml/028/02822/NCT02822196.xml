	<detailed_description>RESEARCH STRATEGY 1 . Background Breast cancer potentially deadly disease affect one eight woman . [ 1 ] Majority undergo mastectomy along different modality treatment like chemotherapy , radiotherapy hormonal treatment . Since mastectomy main commonly preferred treatment breast cancer surgery , raise focus frequently study complication persistent pain follow surgery [ 8 , 9 ] The incidence pain syndrome six month post-breast cancer surgical treatment 52.9 % . [ 7 ] A multivariate analysis presence chronic pain breast cancer survivor reveal risk factor include invasive surgery , radiation therapy surgery , clinically meaningful acute postoperative pain . Each risk factor independently predict intense chronic pain three month surgery . [ 8 ] A 20 % prevalence rate Post Mastectomy Pain syndrome find . Women experience syndrome report chronic , stable pain long duration begin shortly surgery . [ 10 ] The syndrome important recognize debilitate pain . Studies indicate post mastectomy pain interfere activity daily live like drive , take care child , leisure time , sex , result poor quality life . It also note woman survive treatment breast cancer , chronic pain often cause mood change , difficulty work , reduction physical activity . This especially noted woman whose pain spread area body . [ 14 ] There various anesthetic technique available management mastectomy . The effectiveness technique widely study regard pain control , requirement rescue analgesia , side effect , post-operative hospital stay development persistent pain follow breast cancer surgical treatment . Belzarena SD et al compare effectiveness thoracic epidural block general anesthesia oncologic mastectomy . Patients divide two group either receive GA thoracic epidural anesthesia primary anesthetic . [ 10 ] The result show quality postoperative analgesia well epidural group , also present low consumption analgesic . The length hospitalization group also low . They conclude epidural block advantage compare general anesthesia consider anesthesia option oncologic mastectomy axillary lymph node dissection . Newer regional anesthesia technique develop improve pain control patient satisfaction . These include epidural block ( thoracic cervical ) , single injection thoracic PVB intercostal nerve block . PVB breast cancer surgery report decrease acute pain opioid consumption immediately follow surgery multiple randomize clinical trial [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] superior epidural block due low complication rate . A thoracic PVB well-established anesthetic technique proven safe mastectomy . The recent advancement anesthetic technique mastectomy SPB . The SPB novel technique first describe Fajardo et al 2012 [ 2 ] . A single injection block many dermatomes . This technique could effective alternative PVB thoracic epidural , consider feasible , safe thoracic epidural result low complication rate . But long term randomize study prove efficacy SPB . R. Blanco et al study novel ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic technique provide analgesia follow surgery thoracic wall four volunteer . All volunteer report effective block provide long-lasting paresthesia ( 750-840 min ) . There side-effects note initial descriptive study . They suggest confirm preliminary result large clinical trial . [ 12 ] Currently single major clinical trial compare effectiveness SPB PVB Breast Cancer Resections conduct Ghada M N Bashandy , National Cancer Institute , Egypt . [ 13 ] 2 . Protocol/Experimental Design/Flowchart/Primary Secondary End Points Criteria Ages Eligible Study : 18 Years 80 Years Genders Eligible Study : Female No . subject group : 50 . ( Total = 100 ) Informed consent procedure take . Patients educate use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) evaluate pain level print copy VAS scoring provide take home . After completion preoperative assessment OR nurse , patient randomize either SPB group PVB group . The block perform pre operatively . To reduce patient anxiety improve comfort , midazolam 0.02mg/kg IV give except patient &gt; 70 year age . Standard ASA monitor apply include pulse oximetry , noninvasive blood pressure , electrocardiogram . Procedure : Serratus Anterior Muscle Plane block ( SPB ) The US probe place mid-axillary line level 5th intercostal space . The latissimus dorsi ( superficial posterior ) , teres major ( superior ) serratus muscle ( deep inferior ) identify . Using in-plane approach , block needle ( 22 G , 50 mm ) insert tip visualized serratus anterior muscle intercostal muscle . As extra reference point thoracodorsal artery use aid identification plane superficial serratus muscle . After negative aspiration blood , local anesthetic ( 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine ) inject visualized real-time . [ 11 ] Procedure : Paravertebral Block ( PVB ) Patients place sit position , lean forward . After skin disinfection use chlorhexidine solution , target spinous process T1- T5 identify parasagittal plan 2.5 cm , skin wheel raise use 1 % lidocaine . A 20-gauge , bevel needle advanced transverse process locate . The depth skin transverse process marked/identified needle marking . The needle withdrawn 1-2 cm angle ( walked transverse process ) . The needle re-advanced 1cm past initial marking . After negative aspiration , 4-5 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine slowly inject . The procedure repeat level T2 T6 ensure total dose bupivacaine exceed maximum dose recommend . [ 13 ] After block perform , subject receive induction general anesthesia fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg , propofol 1-2 mg/kg suxamethonium 1 mg/kg . After induction trachea intubate 7.0 mm ID endotracheal tube . For analgesia patient receive 1 gm intravenous acetaminophen . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane oxygen air . To minimize PONV , every patient receive ondansetron 4mg end surgery . Fentanyl 25 mcg bolus use rescue analgesia intra operatively . When extubation criterion meet trachea extubated patient take PACU . PACU phase I For VAS &gt; 6 , 0.5 mg intravenous hydromorphone every 10 min 2 mg rescue analgesia For VAS &lt; /=6 , patient give tramadol 100 mg. PACU phase II Prior discharge patient receive tramadol 50mg require pain medication phase I . At discharge , patient prescribe Norco ( 7.5/325 ) every 4 hour prn VAS &gt; 4 . Reinforcement previous education VAS score do part discharge instruction discharge nurse . The following parameter record group . - Duration block analgesia - time peak pain/return sensation surgery record - Dermatomal distribution sensory loss obtain block test ice . - Assessment static dynamic VAS score 0 ( arrival PACU ) , 6 , 12 , 24 48 hour , 3 month 6 month surgery additional set question assess neuropathic pain . ( painDETECT ) - Time 1st rescue analgesia - Total dose rescue analgesia receive first 24 48 hr 3 . Sample size statistical analysis Statistical analysis plan StatistiCall create randomization list use software ClinStat ( St. George 's Hospital Medical School , Version date 08.05.96 ) . The treatment name 1 SPB Block , 2 PVB block part study list . Block randomization X block X patient use . Since valid data compare 2 block , unable construct realistic power analysis hypothesis difference 2 procedure potentially minimal yet statistically prove . Therefore , initial investigation 100 subject clinically logistically feasible analysis provide statistical guidance necessary additional study . The investigator responsible analyze study data , analyst blind patient ' group assignment execution study . For purpose final analysis , official clinical database unblinded medical/scientific review complete investigator assure data complete . Before perform analysis , distribution variable examine appropriateness distribution assumption . Descriptive statistic summarize variable include demographic , duration analgesia , VAS score rest surgery , time 1st rescue analgesia , total dose rescue analgesia receive 24 hrs side effect . Mean Â± SD report continuous variable frequency ( percentage ) report discrete variable . Analysis variance Kruskal-Wallis test appropriate use analyze compare primary endpoint VAS among two group well secondary endpoint . Chi-square test extend Fisher 's exact test appropriate use comparison incidence chronic pain well side effect . All analysis perform use SAS 9.3 ( Cary , NC ) p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
