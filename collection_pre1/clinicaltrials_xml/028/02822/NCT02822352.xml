	<brief_summary>Colitis inflammation large bowel often cause condition know ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease . In condition , body exaggerate inflammatory response bowel - body attack bowel . Patients colitis affect large bowel 8 year increase risk cancer large bowel . In view , many national gastroenterology organisation recommend patient regular colonoscopy detect pre-cancerous area even early cancer large bowel . Early detection area , lead early treatment thereby reduce risk develop significant large bowel cancer . These regular colonoscopy know surveillance colonoscopy . Official international guideline surveillance patient ulcerative Crohn 's colitis advise take 4 random sample large bowel tissue ( biopsy ) every 10 centimeter suspicious area . Recent study show spray dye indigo carmine ( type food dye ) help highlight abnormal area could harbor pre-cancerous cell . This technique time-consuming , tedious . There set standard consider satisfactorily complete dye spray colonoscopy . The uptake technique UK uniform . Therefore virtual chromoendoscopy study alternative method improve detection pre-cancerous tissue patient longstanding colitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT : HDWL vs Virtual Chromoendoscopy Detection Intraepithelial Neoplasia Longstanding Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Virtual chromoendoscopy system enhance specific characteristic line large bowel surface pattern mucosal vasculature . This theoretically increase detection pre-cancerous tissue compare high definition white light endoscopy alone . Narrow-band image NBI ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , Blue Laser ( Fujinon , Tokyo , Japan ) OE scan ( Pentax , Tokyo , Japan ) use optical light filter select particular narrow spectrum red , green blue light relative decrease proportion red light . The Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy ( FICE ) system use post hoc computer algorithm , apply different filter store endoscopic image enable theoretically endless number combination filter use . The Pentax I-SCAN system also allow post hoc modification image . It provide ability enhance mucosal surface well highlight mucosal change . These new image technique theoretical advantage , extendedly use sale purpose far proven surveillance precancerous early cancer large bowel patient longstanding colitis .</detailed_description>
