	<detailed_description>The study design two-arm , randomize , control trial . The control arm consist standard conventional perioperative care . The intervention arm consist protocol-driven ERAS program . All patient know suspected gynecologic malignancy schedule open abdominal surgery gynecologic oncology clinic screen study eligibility . Those eligible study approach participation study provide write informed consent . Once enrol , study participant randomize two arm ( control group ERAS group ) use block randomization ( block size=6 ) . Block randomization perform use online randomization generator access http : //www.sealed envelope.com/simple randomizer /v1/lists . Due requirement active patient provider participation , possible perform study blind participant care provider . Study investigator responsible data collection outcomes assessment blind randomization assignment . Once randomize , patient see preoperative clinic give specific preoperative instruction dictate study group . On day surgery , patient receive perioperative care per protocol , base assign group . During postoperative care , patient ask fill daily diary document recovery progress , assess ability meet study milestone , note ( e.g . pain ambulation ) . Patients eligible discharge meeting pre-defined discharge criterion , include : tolerating oral fluid diet , pain control oral pain regimen , return bowel function ( flatus ) , self-caring ( able dress , shower , groom ) , mobilize independently . Assessment parameter make gynecologic oncology clinician . After discharge , patient follow-up gynecologic oncology clinic 2 week 6 week postoperatively . Both arm study protocol-driven , checklists patient , nursing staff , house staff help compliance . Teaching session dry run hold trial commencement clarify point confusion reduce protocol violation . Data collection subject perform throughout duration enrollment study . Data abstract medical record chart Enterprise Data Warehouse corroborate Power chart ( Northwestern Memorial Hospital ) , EPIC ( Northwestern Memorial Hospital Medical record system ) , Surginet ( Northwestern Memorial Hospital Surgical Medical Record System ) . In addition demographic clinical information abstract medical record , subject also complete validate Quality Recovery Survey ( QOR ( Quality Recovery-40 question survey ) 2 week post-surgery . Lastly , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) level determine blood collect pre-operatively ( coincide schedule pre-operative clinic visit ) post-operative day 1 ( POD # 1 ( post operative day ) ] , coincide schedule POD # 1 blood draw ) . Blood sample collect provide , 10ml red top vacuum collection tube ( anti-coagulant ) . After collection whole blood , blood allow clot leave undisturbed room temperature 30 minute . Clot remove centrifugation 2,000 x g 10 minute 4Â°C refrigerate centrifuge . Using Pasteur pipette liquid supernatant ( serum ) immediately transfer collection tube apportion 0.5 ml aliquot freeze liquid nitrogen . Samples batch process CRP IL-6 level ELISA accord manufacturer instruction ( affymetrix eBioscience Catalog Numbers : 88-7502 88-7066 ) .</detailed_description>
