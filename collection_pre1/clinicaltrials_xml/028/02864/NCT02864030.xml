	<brief_summary>On March 17th , 2011 , European Commission issue market authorization valid throughout European Union Eribulin mesylate ( Halaven ; Eisai Limited ) , treatment patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer progress least two chemotherapic regimen advance disease . As use Eribulin widespread tumor setting , good knowledge safety profile outside clinical trial warrant . Indeed possibility select patient risk develop Eribulin-induced neuropathy , allow exclusion treatment patient harbour specific single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) . Given Eribulin toxicity often result treatment discontinuation , ability anticipate patient experience severe toxicity could allow either early intervention even possibly prophylactic therapy , selection patient treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PAINTER : Polymorphism And INcidence Toxicity ERibulin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study primarily aim survey tolerability profile Eribulin unselected population patient metastatic breast cancer relation toxicity already describe clinical trial , neurotoxicity particular . The secondary objective trial include : - To study relationship specific genetic polymorphism incidence severity peripheral neuropathy - To describe treatment efficacy term duration treatment impact survival . All toxicity collect classify accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology criterion Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.0 monitor treatment period 30 day therapy discontinuation . In particular , evaluation incidence outcome grade AEs already record previous clinical trial collect , follow : - asthenia/fatigue , - neutropenia , - alopecia , - nausea , - peripheral neuropathy - constipation Any unexpected AEs shall evaluate likewise . Patients must follow AEs every ongoing Eribulin-related/unrelated toxicity AE resolve , Investigator assess `` chronic '' `` stable '' end trial , whichever come first . For patient begin new anticancer therapy last study drug administration , AEs report period end time new treatment start . For determination polymorphism , routine blood collection two tubes 3-5 ml blood perform . The sample collect time participant 's first two treatment cycle . Blood collect Vacutainer contain ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . Immediately blood collection , tube invert ( least five time ) store - 20Â° C .</detailed_description>
