	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) versus docetaxel participant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive tumor experience disease progression platinum-containing systemic therapy . The primary hypothesis study pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) prolong overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare docetaxel participant PD-L1 positive tumor</brief_summary>
