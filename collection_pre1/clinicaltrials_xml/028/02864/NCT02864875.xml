	<brief_summary>The objetive study compare treatment two group politrauma patient fibrinogen deficiency ( Fibtem &lt; 9 ) diagnose thromboelastography ( ROTEM ) clinical laboratorial sign coagulopathy emergency room admission . One group receive fibrinogen concentrate ( Haemocomplettan ) control group clinically follow . If group show clinical sign coagulopathy treat anesthesiologist decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coagulation defect relate severe trauma , trauma-induced coagulopathy ( TIC ) several related factor , include : blood loss extensive consumption coagulation platelet factor , dilutional coagulopathy administration crystalloids colloid maintain blood pressure , addition main cause pathophysiological indicated activation fibrinolytic system secondary hyperfibrinolysis activation protein C. The presence TIC reflect extent severity injury directly correlate mortality ; The fibrinogen play important role coagulation . The concentration fibrinogen plasma high coagulation factor , acute phase protein undergoes elevation plasma level inflammation . In final phase coagulation , large amount fibrinogen capture activated platelet glycoprotein IIb / IIIa receptor . Especially maximum value thrombus firmness influence number platelet plasma fibrinogen level . Recent study suggest thromboelastography would appropriate monitor hemostasis earlier traditional laboratory method ( prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , serum fibrinogen ) . This method able provide information polymerization fibrin presence platelet activity , fibrinogen deficiency evaluation , factor XIII deficiency hemofilia . Fibrinogen find human plasma , cryoprecipitate fibrinogen concentrate ( HeamocompletanÂ® ) ; The amount fibrinogen cryoprecipitate per milliliter cryoprecipitate much high plasma , justifies use cryoprecipitate place plasma goal offer patient Fibrinogen . However , study deserve perform compare use cryoprecipitate fibrinogen concentrate . This study aim compare classical approach await sign clinical coaguloplatia proactive approach fibrinogen replacement perform early use concentrated fibrinogen . Objective evaluate possible decrease amount concentrate transfuse RBCs anticipatory approach . This study show important original , prospective , since shortage world literature comparative study regard .</detailed_description>
