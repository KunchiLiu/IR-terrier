It enable use data real-time routine practice present QoL score physicians simple graphical histogram transversal longitudinal measurement ensure reliable data collection . Objectives The main objective collect analyse QoL gynecologic cancer patient prospective pragmatic cohort study . The primary endpoint QoL assess European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-C30 ( Core Quality Life Questionnaire ) , follow targeted dimension : global health , emotional , social functional role fatigue The secondary objective assess endpoint : - participation rate - acceptability use CHES tablet computer - use QoL result physicians - occurence type miss data - attrition Study population All adult patient gynecologic cancer ( ovarian , endometrial cervical cancer ) , treat University hospital Besançon , give inform consent , prospectively include . Patients well understand French , cognitive impairment social insurance include . Data collection Socio-demographic , socio-economic ( occupational group , attain education , income ) , behavioural ( physical activity ) , previous history familial history cancer , clinical , medical data , biomarkers , therapeutic strategy , toxicity QoL prospectively collect inclusion throughout follow-up . As context pragmatic clinical practice , visit base usual follow-up gynecologic cancer patient . QoL assess use EORCT QLQ-C30 questionnaire specific module QLQ-CX24 ( cervix ) , QLQ-OV28 ( ovary ) QLQ-EN24 ( endometrium ) , use time-driven design . These auto-questionnaires administrate CHES help clinical research associate inclusion , treatment , 3 week treatment `` routine '' follow-up visit least 6 month . If patient want use tablet computer , `` pen-paper questionnaire '' administer . Statistical analysis Usual statistical method use description socio-demographic , socio-professional , clinical patient inclusion QoL throughout follow-up . Those characteristic describe consider cancer localization stage use therapeutics/surgeries . We also describe participation rate . The acceptability use CHES tablet computer use QoL result physicians qualitatively describe . Missing data describe assess profile patient miss data , occurence miss data QoL item , incomplete QoL questionnaire rate type miss data ( miss random , miss completely random , miss random ) .</detailed_description>
