Leapfrog ACO movement along nonprofit group Institute Health Care Improvement place quality cost effectiveness spotlight clinician ICU beyond . While clinician always focus evidence base therapy little concern cost , new era healthcare understand cost , value effectiveness therapy key improve patient outcome institutional solvency try economic time . Vanderbilt elect enroll CMS valve bundle trial . The Leadership team heart vascular institute identify importance electronic medical record include display utilization key driver quality success across continuum care ( Preoperative assessment discharge 90 day ) bundle payment model care . A multidisciplinary team develop conjunction nurse , midlevel provider , multi-specialty physician , case manager , informatics specialist , performance improvement representative develop electronic pathway care use evidence base best practice cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multidisciplinary team consist physician , pharmacist , nutritionist , social worker , bedside nurse , physical therapist , mid-level provider develop structure key element milestone pathway . The Vanderbilt University Informatics Team develop electronic version consensus milestone . The pathway encompass 17 phase begin pre-procedure evaluation continue perioperative period three-month follow-up post procedure . The nursing staff perform documentation pathway stag index hospitalization , milestone stage display door patient 's room . The milestone stage discuss multi-disciplinary bedside round ICU , patient could progress next stage nurse would document reason failure progress . In study , investigator compare patient underwent valve surgery milestone pathway place , patient underwent valve surgery without milestone pathway place . Patients adjust accord baseline characteristic demographic , procedure , proceduralist collect electronic medical record Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) database . The investigator primary clinical outcome mortality , secondary clinical outcome include incidence re-intubation within 48 hour , acute kidney injury define Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome ( KDIGO ) criterion , delirium , major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , infection rate catheter central line associate infection well sternal wound infection . In addition investigator examine financial outcome include variance direct total cost , direct total cost per patient .</detailed_description>
