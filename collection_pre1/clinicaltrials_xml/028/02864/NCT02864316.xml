	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic unresectable solid tumor standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . The primary site metastatic unresectable tumor must arise within previously irradiate site consider radiationinduced tumor . Pretreatment tumor specimen available . Patients available archived specimen must willing undergo pretreatment tumor biopsy . Measurable disease . Progressive disease study entry . Received adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy develop recurrent metastatic disease within 6 month complete therapy . Age &gt; 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . Life expectancy great 3 month . Adequate organ marrow function define : White Blood Cell &gt; 2,000/per microliter Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/per microliter Platelets &gt; 100,000/per microliter Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) Aspartate Aminotransferase ( SGOT ) /Alanine Aminotransferase ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 X institutional ULN Creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional ULN OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min patient creatinine Levels institutional normal ( calculated use CockcroftGault formula ) Female Creatinine Clearance = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male Creatinine Clearance = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation 31 week last dose nivolumab . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior start nivolumab . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Biopsiable disease time enrollment biopsy progression require participation . Any active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Requiring continuous supplemental oxygen . Chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study unresolved toxicity due agent administer 2 week earlier . Uncontrolled brain metastasis . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition nivolumab . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . Pregnant currently breastfeed . Receiving anticancer therapy . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA 4 antibody therapy , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway . History Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate ongoing acute chronic infection . Requiring systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration .</criteria>
