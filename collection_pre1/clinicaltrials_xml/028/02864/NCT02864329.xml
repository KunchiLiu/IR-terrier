	<brief_summary>Basic clinical research reveal various noncoding small RNAs play important diverse role germ cell development quality , include X/Y silence meiosis , gene regulation , DNA damage response , protection genome transposable element . Indeed , mammalian germ cell know harbor multiple small RNA specie , include small interfering RNAs ( siRNA ) , microRNAs ( miRNA ) , germline- specific PIWI- interacting RNAs ( piRNA ) . However , mechanistic role gametogenesis human infertility largely uncharacterized . The goal study elucidate role small RNA pathways event give rise viable euploid gamete . Four project three core include study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project 2 ( PI : Dr. Darius Paduch ) : Role Small RNAs male infertility . The lead hypothesis project base extensive preliminary result obtain group show 70 % miRNA express human testis highly conserve human rodent . The investigator hypothesize differentially express miRNAs men infertility lead change level target messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) involve key regulatory pathway cell biology . The result project lead well understanding miRNAs ' role male reproduction strong potential enable development new miRNA-based miRNA-regulating therapy . This project help develop new transgenic animal study miRNA vivo implication infertility , also biology testicular cancer . Derived RNA base therapy potential less invasive , less toxic , effective treat serious increasingly prevalent condition . Core A ( PI : Dr. Paula E. Cohen ) : Administration Core . The main objective Administrative Core ( Core A ) provide structure support mechanism entire Center Reproductive Genomics ( CRG ) . The Admin core facilitate interaction across Ithaca Manhattan campuses Cornell University , encourage research small RNA biology , reproductive medicine across clinical discipline , promote strong training reproductive medicine encourage translational focus . In general , Admin core focus effort three major philosophy : translational innovative research , teaching , outreach . Core B ( PI : Dr. Andrew Grimson ) : RNA Sequencing Core . The main objective RNA Sequencing Core ( RSC ) provide user efficient high quality access cutting-edge sequence technology . These sequence technology use member P50-proposal , make available P50-centers . Importantly , member P50 rely access technology achieve project goal . By centralize sequence RSC , sequence perform low cost great efficiency would possible individual user . Core C ( PI : Dr. Peter Schlegel ) : Outreach Core The goal outreach core two-fold : ( 1 ) provide scientific technical resource clinician interested embark research involve small RNA biology physiological system interest , ( 2 ) provide outreach community mean state- of-the-art lecture series . The Innovation Seminars Reproductive Technologies Series ( InSeRT ) , order educate patient late advance understand genetic epigenetic basis human disease .</detailed_description>
