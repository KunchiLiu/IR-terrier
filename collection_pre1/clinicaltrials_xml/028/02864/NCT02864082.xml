	<brief_summary>Congenital ichthyosis ( CI ) large , heterogeneous family inherit skin disorder cornification result abnormality skin keratinization , scale thicken skin . Treatment option include keratolytic agent , abruptly lead extensive shed peeling scale . PAT-001 primarily act keratolytic agent ; thus , make potential drug candidate treatment skin disorder associate hyperkeratinization , CI . The current study intend evaluate safety tolerability PAT-001 patient CI either Lamellar X-Linked subtypes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Topical PAT-001 Congenital Ichthyosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management CI life-long endeavor , remain largely symptomatic ( i.e. , emollient without keratolytics agent ) commonly focus reduce scale and/or skin lubrication systemic topical treatment . A first-line therapy include hydration lubrication accomplish creams ointment contain low concentration salt , urea , glycerol , increase water-binding capacity horny layer . Addition keratolytics agent use decrease corneocyte cohesiveness , promote desquamation , dissolve keratin lipid ( e.g. , Î±-hydroxy acid , salicylic acid , high dose urea , propylene glycol , N-acetylcysteine , retinoids ) . Systemic retinoid treatment reserve patient refractory topical agent long-term adverse effect teratogenicity . This two part , Phase 2 , multicenter , proof-of-concept ( POC ) study safety tolerability PAT-001 treatment Congenital ichthyosis ( CI ) patient age 12 year age old . Part 1 double-blind , randomize , vehicle control , bilateral comparison two treatment ( PAT-001 [ 0.1 % 0.2 % ] vs. vehicle ) eight ( 8 ) week . Part 2 double-blind , active treatment comparison two PAT-001 concentration ( 0.1 % 0.2 % ) additional four ( 4 ) week . Subjects option participate PK portion study .</detailed_description>
