	<brief_title>Adherence Study COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common disease substantial associate morbidity mortality . COPD third lead cause death US claim 133,965 US live 2009 . In 2011 12.7 million US adult estimate COPD . However , approximately 24 million US adult evidence impair lung function , indicate diagnosis COPD . COPD also potentially harmful economic impact . In 2010 , COPD result 10 million office visit , nearly 1.5 million emergency department visit , 700,000 hospitalization , 133,575 death US . In 2010 , US total medical treatment cost attribute solely COPD ( i.e. , exclude comorbidities ) estimate $ 32.1 billion additional $ 3.9 billion COPD cost result worker absenteeism . Even industrialized country US , anti-smoking initiative relatively successful , legacy past smoke behavior age population ensure COPD burden unavoidably continue climb next 20 30 year . Adherence rate inhale combination therapy poor ( average 3.9 refill per year ) . COPD patient low adherence tend high overall healthcare cost , demonstrate 24 month study 33,816 patient US , find : Patients continue therapy low cost care $ 3764 compare patient cease take maintenance therapy . COPD patient higher adherence prescribe regimen experience few hospitalization low Medicare cost ( - $ 2185 ) exhibit low adherence behavior . Given poor adherence inhale combination therapy see patient COPD , associate morbidity/mortality economic cost , present study conduct see medication reminder use improve adherence population .</detailed_description>
