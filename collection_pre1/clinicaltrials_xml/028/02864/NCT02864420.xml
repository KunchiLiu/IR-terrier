	<brief_title>Hospitalization Home : The Acute Care Home Hospital Program Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospitals standard care acute illness United States , hospital care expensive often unsafe , especially old individual . While admit , 20 % suffer delirium , 5 % contract hospital-acquired infection , lose functional status never regain . Timely access inpatient care poor : many hospital ward typically 100 % capacity , emergency department wait protract . Moreover , hospital care increasingly costly : many internal medicine admission negative margin ( i.e. , expenditure exceed hospital revenue ) incur patient debt . The investigator propose home hospital model care substitute treatment acute care hospital . Studies home hospital model demonstrate sizeable proportion acute care deliver home equal quality safety , 20 % reduce cost , 20 % improved patient experience . While standard care several developed country , 2 non-randomized demonstration project conduct United States , highly local need . Taken together , home hospital evidence promise fall short due non-robust experimental design , failure implement modern medical technology , poor enlistment community support . The home hospital module offer medical component standard care acute care hospital . The typical staff ( medical doctor [ MD ] , register nurse [ RN ] , case manager ) , diagnostics ( blood test , vital sign , telemetry , x-ray , ultrasound ) , intravenous therapy , oxygen/nebulizer therapy available home hospital . Optional deployment food service , home health aide , physical therapist , occupational therapist , social worker tailor patient need . Home hospital improve upon component typical ward 's standard care several way : - Point care blood diagnostics ( result bedside &lt; 5 minute ) ; - Minimally invasive continuous vital sign , telemetry , activity tracking , sleep tracking ; - On-demand 24/7 clinician video visit ; - 4 1 patient MD ratio , compare typical 16 1 ; - Ambulatory/portable infusion pump worn hip ; - Optional access personal home health aide Should matter emergent ( , require in-person assistance less 20 minute ) , 9-1-1 call patient return hospital immediately . In previous iteration home hospital happen 2 % patient . Clinical parameter measure discretion physician nurse , treat participant follow evidence-based practice guideline , usual care set . In addition , investigator track wide variety measure quality safety , include measure tailor primary diagnosis .</detailed_description>
