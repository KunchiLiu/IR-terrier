	<detailed_description>Syphilis disproportionately impact gbMSM : Syphilis remain important cause morbidity gbMSM . Up 75 % early syphilis infection occur gbMSM - population syphilis rate nearly 10-fold high HIV negative . In Canada 's urban centre , 2/3 syphilis case HIV-positive gbMSM , re-infection remains high . HIV co-infection syphilis important implication HIV management . Syphilis may increase HIV viral load level virologically suppress individual , genital ulcer increase risk HIV transmission acquisition . The era novel , biomedical prevention technology : Significant advancement shape past two decade HIV care . Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) substantially reduce HIV-associated morbidity mortality extend life expectancy near-normal level . With reduced morbidity mortality associate HIV , gbMSM may also change sexual behaviour . Seroadaptive strategy , serosorting ( select sexual partner serostatus ) seropositioning ( select sexual position minimize risk HIV transmission ) common among gbMSM . While may mitigate risk HIV transmission acquisition , evidence suggest decrease condom use may contribute rise syphilis bacterial STIs high-risk population . Further , new evidence emerge demonstrate efficacy HIV PrEP prevent HIV acquisition . The combination use tenofovir/emtricitabine show Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Initiative ( iPREX ) trial reduce risk HIV acquisition 44 % HIV-negative gbMSM take daily PrEP . Among detectable drug level , risk reduction &gt; 90 % . A role PrEP STIs ? The exciting development HIV prevention encourage investigator expand strategy prevention STIs , modality previously show acceptable gbMSM . A recent pilot study randomize participant receive either antimicrobial doxycycline daily monetary incentive remain STI-free throughout study period . After 48 week , receive doxycycline significantly less likely diagnose STI ( odds ratio : 0.27 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.09-0.83 ) . Though also trend toward benefit doxycycline specifically prevent syphilis , significance achieve outcome . The first large-scale syphilis PrEP study : Given rise rate syphilis disproportionate impact HIV-positive gbMSM , urgent need replicate study broad scale . This propose study contribute field - investigator ' knowledge - first large-scale , methodologically rigorous trial syphilis PrEP , potential provide completely novel innovative tool syphilis prevention armamentarium . It provide insight whether daily doxycycline efficacious PrEP intervention prevention syphilis bacterial STIs , well shed light issue relate feasibility prevention tool , include safety , tolerability , well individual adhere , impact development antimicrobial resistance . These outcome directly line plan output study , potential drastically shift people think manage syphilis STI prevention gbMSM . The investigator ' primary objective : 1 . Determine efficacy daily doxycycline prevent new case syphilis HIV-positive gbMSM . Anticipated output : A significant reduction syphilis incidence doxycycline arm . 2 . Determine safety daily doxycycline prophylaxis . Anticipated output : No significant difference adverse event discontinuation doxycycline placebo arm . The investigator ' secondary objective : 1 . Determine efficacy daily doxycycline prevent new case bacterial STIs . Anticipated output : A significant reduction chlamydia gonorrhoea doxycycline arm . 2 . Measure adherence doxycycline . Anticipated output : Adherence ≥80 % . 3 . Monitor impact prolong daily doxycycline prophylaxis rate antimicrobial resistance . Anticipated output : No significant difference antimicrobial susceptibility profile trial arm .</detailed_description>
