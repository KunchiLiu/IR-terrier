	<brief_summary>This randomized Phase II , three arm control trial patient Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) 2/3 high grade cervical dysplasia . Patients CIN 2/3 meeting eligibility criterion cervical biopsy specimen centrally review study pathologist confirm diagnosis . HPV DNA test HPV 16/18 genotyping perform endocervical cytobrush sample determine HPV status associate dysplasia . Patients CIN 2/3 HPV+ disease enrol study . Patients randomize one three arm : observation ( control ) , imiquimod , imiquimod + 9-valent HPV vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study follow : - To determine treatment efficacy define histologic regression CIN 1 less week 20-24 ( 4 8 week end imiquimod treatment ) HPV Vaccine + Imiquimod group compare control , - To determine treatment efficacy define histologic regression CIN 1 less week 20-24 ( 4 8 week end imiquimod treatment ) Imiquimod group compare control . The secondary objective study follow : - To assess complete regression ( i.e. , histologic remission ) week 20-24 ( 4 8 week end imiquimod treatment ) group , - To assess HPV clearance group , - To assess treatment tolerability . In addition primary secondary objective study , additional exploratory/correlative objective . The exploratory/correlative objective follow : - To assess T cell infiltration post-treatment cervical biopsy endocervical cytobrush sample , - To assess HPV16 E7 immunity CD4/CD8 T cell .</detailed_description>
