	<brief_title>Living Donor Liver Transplantation Unresectable Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) lead cause cancer-related mortality worldwide . Approximately half patient develop metastasis , often liver lung . Surgical treatment liver metastasis ( LM ) curative treatment option ; however , estimate 20-40 % patient candidate liver resection . Surgery offer distinct survival advantage : 5-year survival liver resection LM around 40-50 % study versus 10-20 % 5-year survival chemotherapy alone . In case colorectal metastasis isolate liver `` unresectable '' , total hepatectomy result liver transplantation would remove evident disease . CRC LM consider absolute contraindication liver transplantation ( LT ) center recent report LT colorectal LM single center Oslo , Norway demonstrate 5-year survival 56 % . The Norway study stringent inclusion criterion pre-transplant chemotherapy , transplant patient whose tumor actively grow . As result many participant develop disease recurrence quite rapidly follow transplant . The investigator hypothesize tight criterion would result improved outcome . Unfortunately , lack decease donor graft investigator exist transplant patient , investigator utilize decease donor graft study . Therefore investigator explore Living Donor Liver Transplantation ( LDLT ) . Furthermore , LDLT elective surgery , allow control pre-transplant chemotherapy tumor monitoring . This study offer live donor liver transplantation ( LDLT ) select patient unresectable metastasis 1 ) limit liver 2 ) stable ( non-progressing ) standard chemotherapy . Potential participant evaluate liver transplant suitability must also willing , healthy living donor come forward evaluation . Those participant undergo LDLT follow survival , disease-free survival quality life 5 year compare `` control group '' participant drop study prior transplantation due reason cancer progression .</detailed_description>
