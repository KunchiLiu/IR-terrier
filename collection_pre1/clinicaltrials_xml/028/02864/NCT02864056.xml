	<detailed_description>Amongst people age 65 , people dementia ( PWD ) much likely fall , injure , without dementia . Being injured fall main reason old people attend hospital A &amp; E department . PWD often experience longer hospital stay follow fall , may become confused stressful carer; considerable cost NHS . There evidence exercise programme help prevent fall . Can Tai Chi exercise programme prevent fall among PWD live home ? We investigate whether practise Tai Chi several month improves dynamic postural balance ( good indicator likely someone fall ) . People mild moderate dementia live home eligible take part regular care-giver 'pair ' . We recruit 150 pair , i.e . 150 people dementia informal caregiver ( 300 people total ) . The PWD must age 65 year old must willing able stand Tai Chi . At baseline , researcher visit pair home ass participant ' balance , memory skill , general well-being . Pairs randomly assign either Tai Chi usual care ( intervention ) usual care ( control ) . Pairs intervention group practice Tai Chi together weekly group class hold locally , home , complete diary much time spend Tai Chi six month . All participant complete diary show often fell whether fall caused injury . The baseline assessment repeat six month . A researcher collect feedback pair see whether intervention could ( ) tailor need PWD carers . The change ability balance six month compare PWD group .</detailed_description>
