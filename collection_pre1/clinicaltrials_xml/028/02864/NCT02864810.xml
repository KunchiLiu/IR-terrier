	<criteria>Patient ≥ 19 year age male female race/ethnicity . Patient sign symptom acute DVT leg , acute PE ATE ; arterial intervention surgery , endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair preferably within 14 day prior plan study [ 18F ] GP1 . Patient thromboembolic focus/foci confirm standard imaging modality within 5 day prior administration [ 18F ] GP1 . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 time screen . Patient clinical laboratory test within follow range , determine within 7 day prior administration [ 18F ] GP1 : White blood cell count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L ; Platelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/L ; ALT AST ≤ 3.0 time upper limit normal ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal A patient exclude study patient fulfill inclusion criterion , follow condition observe : Patient patient 's legally acceptable representative provide write informed consent . In case acute DVT PE , patient previous history objectively diagnose DVT PE . Patient pretreatment glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor within 15 day administration [ 18F ] GP1 Chemotherapy schedule give patient within 24 hour administration [ 18F ] GP1 . Female patient pregnant nursing . Patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease cancer ( e.g . congestive heart failure , acute myocardial infarction , severe pulmonary disease , chronic renal hepatic disease could compromise participation study ) judgment investigator . Patient relative investigator , student investigator otherwise dependent . Patient involve another investigative clinical study involve administration investigational drug precede 4 week 24 hour administration [ 18F ] GP1 . Patient previously include study . Patient condition personal circumstance , judgment investigator , might make collection complete data difficult impossible . Additiverelated precaution : This investigational product contain sodium bisulfite , sulfite may cause allergictype reaction include anaphylactic symptom lifethreatening less severe asthmatic episode certain susceptible people . The overall prevalence sulfite sensitivity general population unknown probably low . Sulfite sensitivity see frequently asthmatic nonasthmatic people .</criteria>
