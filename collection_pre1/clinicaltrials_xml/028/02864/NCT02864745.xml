	<detailed_description>Background . Functional disability , natural consequence weakness , frequent long-lasting complication survivor critical illness . Over recent decade , mortality acute critical illness decrease consequent increase number ICU survivor . Understanding post-ICU morbidity experience survivor become increasingly important . The great burden survivor critical illness face relate neuromuscular dysfunction neuropsychological maladjustment . In particular , neuromuscular abnormality critical illness common , median prevalence 57 % . In patient chronic critical illness survivor severe critical illness , neuromuscular weakness may substantial persistent , result important decrement physical function quality life year discharge . In past , routine feature general care provide ICU include liberal use sedation immobilization patient , think necessary facilitating intervention normalise physiological function artificial mean . Recently , paradigm shift away approach towards conservative treatment philosophy patient ICU . This paradigm shift consistent observation long-term physical problem survivor critical illness , particularly respiratory failure , may result protracted ICU stay period immobilization patient receive organ support essential survival . In line , daily interruption sedation policy widely adopt proven beneficial early mobilization culture spread quickly across ICUs . Indeed , strategy , together early physical therapy safe effective intervention prevention long-term neuromuscular disability survivor intensive care . It stress study , early rehabilitation define start day 2-5 ICU stay activity begin ICU discharge . Standard early rehabilitation start early enough , functional electrical stimulation-assisted cycle ergometry may solution dilemma.The first week ICU critical muscle mass function lose quickly . Immobility-associated muscle loss evident early within18-48 hour onset acute critical illness severe injury great first 2 3 week critical illness . Up 40 % loss muscle strength occur within first week immobilization , daily rate strength loss 1.0 % 5.5 % A 10-14 % decrease cross-sectional measurement rectus femoris muscle observe within first week ICU stay . Conventional rehabilitation first day ICU indeed limit patient sedate mechanically ventilate , typically consist passive limb movement , without use stretch reflex provide early ( within 48 hour intubation ) large dose rehabilitation ( 26Â±14 min day patient mechanical ventilation ) report improvement physical function hospital discharge , measurement beyond . Active rehabilitation delay neurological condition patient improve enough facilitate participation . In sick patient , particular risk develop ICUAW , sedation immobility may prolong well beyond first week , establish damage muscle already occur . In order achieve maximum efficacy , passive cycling neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) deliver simultaneously synchronise produce coordinate pattern movement . The technique call FES-CE ( functional electrical stimulation-assisted cycle ergometry ) . There large body experience method rehabilitation patient stroke spinal cord injury . The method effective preventing loss muscle mass show improve anabolic resistance insulin sensitivity quadriplegic patient . In critical illness , pilot study show NMES ( without synchronization use bicycle ) safe , feasible effective maintain muscle strength mass . The study FES-CE critically illness pilot trial Parry et al. , feasibility safety FES-CE demonstrate small cohort critically ill patient ( 8 patient receive FES-CE intervention , versus 8 control ) . Patients intervention group show significant improvement Physical Function Intensive Care Test faster recovery functional milestone ( e.g . time stand lie , walk spot ) . Hypotheses H1 : As damage structure function skeletal muscle occurs first week , intensified rehabilitation , include FES-CE start within 48 hour ICU admission , improve functional outcome ICU survivor 6 month compare routine standard care . H2 : Intensified early rehabilitation compare routine standard care , shall preserve muscle mass improve muscle power ICU discharge . H3 : Intensified early rehabilitation compare routine standard care shall increase insulin-mediated whole-body oxidative glucose disposal mitochondrial functional index . Sample size calculation : In study critical illness outcome 6-months use 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) score , standard deviation vary 10-13 point . In order 80 % power detect 5 point difference SF-36 score control intervention level significance p &lt; 0.05 population standard deviation ( SD ) 13 , would need 108 subject ( 54 arm ) . In order allow death dropout , plan randomize 150 subject . Randomization . As soon possible , always within 48 hour admission , participant randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive either standard care intervention use offsite-independent randomization protocol ( www.randomization.com ) . Randomization stratify accord presence absence sepsis availability biopsy baseline . Concealed allocation perform use sequentially number opaque seal envelope accessible research personnel involvement trial . Once consent/assent obtain , prior randomisation ; participant refer study physiotherapist administer baseline test muscle mass/cross-sectional area ( CSA ) use diagnostic ultrasound ( US ) , baseline blood sample take Both group receive usual best medical nursing care ICU , include daily sedation hold applicable delirium management usual routine practice . Respiratory physiotherapy also deliver without alteration . The routine standard care arm undergo mobilisation/rehabilitation deliver personnel involve study usual , routine way . Details physiotherapy treatment record protocolled standard care arm . Intervention group In intervention arm , early rehabilitation protocolled accord patient ' condition degree cooperation pre-defined safety criterion , accordance current recommendation active rehabilitation critically ill ventilate adult . Whilst safety criterion bind study physiotherapist , rehabilitation protocol delivery physical exercise alter accord actual patient 's condition . However , alteration reason record . The intervention start soon possible always within 48 h ICU admission , continue ICU discharge . Supine cycling deliver per protocol supine cycloergometer attach neuromuscular stimulator Surface electrodes applied gluteal , hamstring , quadriceps calf muscle leg . The intensity muscle stimulation deliver level able cause visible contraction ( confirm palpation uncertain ) muscle group without cause undue pain discomfort participant , accord regime specify Parry , 2012 . Once patient alert , able participate , provide standardized encouragement engage therapy . To increase intervention workload , resistance increase incrementally cycle cadence . If participant readmitted intensive care , intervention re-initiated . Study Procedures The ICUs paperless fully computerize , vital function physiological parameter monitor data routinely store secure hospital data base via protect dedicated network . This include data nutritional intake urinary output . Urine sample collect daily , surface toluene store deep freeze facility later determination nitrogen content 3-methyl histidine level ( calculate muscle catabolism rate nitrogen balance ) . In addition , study patient undergo assessment study physiotherapist , include measurement rectus muscle cross-sectional area leg whenever patient regain consciousness , also muscle power Medical Research Concil ( MRC ) score ( standardized test muscle power [ 0-5 ] 12 muscle group 4 limb , give score 0-60 ( 60 suggest normal muscle power ) . Blood take , plasma separate frozen -80 C later analysis cytokine hormone level . This assessment repeat 7-day interval ICU discharge . At ICU discharge , patient relative ask provide contact detail follow . After 6 month , patient family contact structured interview require SF-36 questionnaire , collect use Research Development Organization ( RAND ) methodology . Whilst participant intervention physiotherapist blind group allocation , research staff assess outcome separate clinical department thus remain blinded treatment allocation . Complementary Studies : Insulin resistance mitochondrial function These study perform addition study procedure subgroup patient , give specific consent . First measurement perform baseline prior randomization , ideally next morning admission . Second measurement day 7 ICU stay , i.e . least 5 day intervention . Muscle biopsy . Will perform vastus lateralis muscle needle biopsy technique . The sample separate three part ( 50-100mg ) . One part immediately frozen liquid nitrogen analysis protein/DNA ratio protein expression study . The second part frozen liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane muscle fibre type immunohistochemistry analysis . The third part put culture medium ice preparation homogenates measurement citrate-synthase activity , spectrophotometric analysis activity respiratory complex I-IV western blot analysis respiratory complex . In fresh muscle homogenate , investigator use high-resolution respirometry determine function individual respiratory complex cytosolic context measure basic functional metabolic index . investigator specifically look degree mitochondrial uncoupling , respiratory chain capacity function individual complex , include glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle . Frozen muscle sample store deeply frozen analysis DNA/protein ratio , messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) proteins involve regulation proteolysis , substrate oxidation anabolic pathway skeletal muscle well immunohistochemistry type muscle fibre . In addition , investigator look change index seven day critical illness influence intervention vs. standard care . investigator look correlation parameter muscle power ( i.e . compare bioenergetics profile skeletal muscle develop ICUAW ) insulin resistance . Insulin sensitivity substrate oxidation measure overnight fast hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamp .</detailed_description>
