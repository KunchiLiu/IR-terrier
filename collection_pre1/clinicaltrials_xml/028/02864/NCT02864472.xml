	<brief_title>Comparison PDT Combination With Ranibizumab vs. Ranibizumab Monotherapy Persistent PCV With Initial Loading Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCV generally recognize subtype wet AMD characterize presence aneurysmal orange-red polypoidal lesion without branch vascular network ( BVN ) choroidal vasculature observe indocyanine angiography ( ICGA ) , represent 13 % 54.7 % newly diagnose patient neovascular AMD . Fifty percent PCV persistent leakage recurrent bleed poor visual outcome , leave untreated . And EVEREST study show synergistic effect anti-VEGF vPDT combination : vPDT strongly regress polyp anti-VEGF control up-regulation VEGF induce vPDT compare ranibizumab monotherapy newly diagnose PCV patient . Additionally , combination offer opportunity individualize treatment potentially few treatment less cost . Therefore , aim study compare efficacy early intervention PDT combination compare consecutive monthly treatment intravitreal ranibizumab injection PCV patient show insufficient response initial loading dose .</detailed_description>
