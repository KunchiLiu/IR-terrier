	<brief_summary>Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma ( GBM ) complete partial surgical resection , CMV seropositive patient eligible enroll 2-arm randomization trial . Following standard care chemoradiation , eligible subject consent randomized cycle either 5-day standard care post-radiation temozolomide ( TMZ ) 21-day dose-intensified TMZ . Subjects receive tetanus-diphtheria ( Td ) pre-conditioning day 22 first post-radiation cycle TMZ follow day , receive first 3 every week via intradermal ( i.d . ) injection study drug cytomegalovirus peptide ( PEP-CMV ) , vaccine mixture comprise 2 component ( refer Component A Component B ) . The subject resume cycle TMZ , result ~35-day delay cycle 1 2 , continue PEP-CMV vaccination every month cycle TMZ monthly maximum 20 vaccine unless progression occurs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients may enrol follow radiation therapy prior initiation post-radiation therapy cycle TMZ provide meet eligibility criterion ( screen consent obtain CMV screen confirm eligibility , do prior chemoradiation ) . At time enrollment , sign consent , patient undergo immune monitoring blood work Tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination 0.5 mL Td ( tetanus , diphtheria toxoid , adsorb ) randomize receive ( 1 ) standard TMZ ( 150-200 mg/m^2/day day 1-5 28 day cycle ) vaccination Day 23 ( ±1 day ) TMZ cycle , ( 2 ) dose-intensified TMZ ( 75-100 mg/m^2/day day 1-21 28 day cycle ) vaccination day 23 ( ±1 day ) TMZ cycle . Each arm 18 patient . In order randomize 36 goal 26 evaluable patient primary outcome , 45 consent . For arm , patient must screen Duke within 3+/- 1 week completion standard care radiation . For 5-day arm , initial cycle TMZ begin 3 ( ±1 ) week complete radiation therapy ( RT ) standard target dose 150-200 mg/m^2/d 5 day . For 21-day arm , initial cycle dose-intensified dose 75-100 mg/m^2/d 21 day . All patient receive tetanus pre-conditioning injection right groin ( describe ) day 22 ( ±1 day ) follow day receive vaccine prepare follow : 500 µg PEP-CMV Component A mixed Montanide ISA-51 ( Incomplete Freund 's Adjuvant ) intradermally administer right groin 500 µg PEP-CMV Component B mix 150 µg Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) intradermally administer leave groin . Vaccines # 2 # 3 give 2 week interval , result ~35-day delay start TMZ cycle 2 . An unacceptable toxicity define follow toxicity attribute vaccine : Grade 3 toxicity attributable TMZ disease progression resolve baseline within 2 week , Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction require steroid , Grade 4 toxicity , include neurologic event due progressive disease , life threatening-event attributable concomitant medication , co-morbid event , disease progression . The prevalence unacceptable toxicity occur vaccination administer concurrently temozolomide continuously monitor . If 25 % accrued patient experience unacceptable toxicity , accrual suspend report toxicity carefully review determine modification protocol treatment occur . Peptide vaccination employ GM-CSF Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant generally well tolerated human patient numerous phase I-III trial . Treatment Plan : Patients vaccinated conjunction subsequent 28-day TMZ cycle total 6 12 cycle TMZ RT . Cycles may give every 5 ( ± 1 ) week order adjust slight delay startup 28-day cycle total number cycle give discretion treat oncologist . During TMZ cycle , vaccination occur day 23 ( ±1 day ) cycle arm : ( 1 ) standard TMZ ( 150-200 mg/m^2/day day 1-5 28 day cycle ) vaccination Day 23 ( -1 day , + 2 day ) TMZ cycle , ( 2 ) dose-intensified TMZ ( 75-100 mg/m^2/day day 1-21 28 day cycle ) vaccination day 23 ( ±1 day ) TMZ cycle . All vaccine give i.d . approximately 10 cm inguinal ligament bilaterally ( Component A administer right groin Component B administer left groin ) . A target six cycle maximum twelve cycle TMZ may give discretion treat neuro-oncologist . Vaccines continue completion TMZ cycle begin 5 ( ± 1 ) week completion last TMZ cycle maximum number 20 vaccine ( unless tumor progression occur ) . Patients image contrast-enhanced MRI pre &amp; post-surgical resection ( prior initiation chemoradiation ) , post-chemoradiation every 2 month start TMZ . The modified Revised Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion use assessment pseudoprogression patient demonstrate definitive progression remove study . Any patient remove prior immune monitoring post vaccine 3 replace immunologic endpoint . Clinical endpoint comparison make amongst patient successfully randomize adjuvant TMZ treatment arm . Prior post-RT TMZ cycle 1 upfront Td booster immunization , blood immune monitoring obtain . In addition blood immune monitoring obtain prior vaccine 1 ( Td per-conditioning visit ) , clinic visit second cycle TMZ , prior vaccine 4 , 6 . Finally , blood immune monitoring obtain tumor progression ( feasible ) . As part standard care patient , upon tumor progression , participant may undergo stereotactic biopsy resection . As research procedure , consent obtain separately . Patients procedure do Duke University Health System , may approach participate Duke Brain Tumor Center Bio-repository study ( Pro00007434 ) . Tissue obtain patient consented Duke Brain Tumor Center Bio-repository use assess immunologic cell infiltration , antigen expression , bio-markers immunologic response .</detailed_description>
