	<detailed_description>Cognitive remediation ( CR ) physical exercise separately show promising result schizophrenia cognitive improvement , despite , impact improve functionality still limit . Physical exercise increase Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) level , promote neuronal cognitive plasticity , maximize impact CR . The aim project study efficacy intensive program ( 3 month ) combine CR physical exercise randomize control trial 74 patient chronic schizophrenia randomize two group : 1 ) CR plus physical exercise ; 2 ) CR plus control activity ( health promotion ) . Primary outcome measure cognitive performance , functional outcome , negative symptom BDNF level . Measures blindly assess baseline , 3 month follow 15 month follow . The investigator expect : ) CR plus physical exercise superior CR plus control activity improve cognition , functional outcome , negative symptom increase BDNF level short medium term ( 3 15 month ) ; ii ) change BDNF level CR plus physical exercise adequate biomarker cognitive improvement obtain treatment .</detailed_description>
