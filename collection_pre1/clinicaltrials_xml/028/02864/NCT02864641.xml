	<brief_title>Mobile Technology Online Tools Track Adherence Chronic Illness Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances medical treatment option past several decade translate substantially high survival rate suffer chronic illness . Consequently , prevalence chronic illness risen significantly recent year , one every four youth United States currently live chronic illness . The health well-being youth directly impact degree adhere treatment regimen . However , treatment regimen chronic illness highly complex , make adherence problematic , particularly combine deficit memory executive function concomitant many chronic illness . Adherence also tend deteriorate time ; youth 's motivation commitment treatment may decline symptom improve negative side effect occur . With low adherence come worsen symptom significantly great risk serious medical complication mortality young adulthood . The cost associate low adherence , need additional care , also substantial patient society . While number factor find impact treatment adherence , risk non-adherence—across varied form chronic illness—is markedly elevate youth lack disease- treatment-related knowledge parent provide little supervision carry regimen task . With nearly 90 % youth chronic illness expect survive therefore transition pediatric care adult-focused healthcare system , critically important empower youth take ownership healthcare . To , tool need provide accessible , affordable tool effectively increase patient ' skill knowledge manage illness support on-going adherence treatment regimen . The purpose project test efficacy Planet K , mobile web-based technology infrastructure specifically design ( ) enhance youth ' chronic kidney disease- treatment-related knowledge interactive game-based educational material ; ( b ) support adherence treatment regimen customize task prompt via mobile web-based delivery ; ( c ) promote patient-provider communication real-world data collection feedback loop . Investigators examine effectiveness Planet K mobile app website improve treatment adherence , disease-related knowledge , transition readiness , condition management , psychological correlate variable adolescent young adult chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . All participant complete study measure pre- post-assessment time point . In total , participant take part study approximately 2 month pre- post-assessment . Families recruit participate either treatment condition control group . Families treatment condition receive Planet K app access associate website full duration study ( 4 month ) pre-test post-test . Families control group receive access app website instead ask complete series online questionnaires two data collection time point ( pre-test , post-test ) . Investigators hypothesize great use ( i.e. , dosage ) prolong use Planet K : increase disease-related knowledge , treatment adherence , self-efficacy management CKD , current CKD self-management behavior , perceive severity CKD , readiness transition independent self-care , perceive benefit CKD treatment , also decrease perceive barrier CKD treatment . Moreover , investigator believe improvement outcome use Planet K result positive mental health outcome participant , include low depression higher report quality life . Investigators expect treatment condition well outcome control group measure midpoint post-assessment time point . Finally , investigator expect participant report high usability , quality , value Planet K mobile app website positively rate experience Planet K .</detailed_description>
