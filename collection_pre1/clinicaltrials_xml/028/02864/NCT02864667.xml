	<detailed_description>Koning Breast CT ( KBCT ) approve FDA PMA . The X-ray detector originally use Koning Breast CT PaxScan 4030CB . Recently , Koning Breast CT use modify X-ray detector PaxScan 4030MCT . The modified detector essentially identical previous model except different detector housing allow narrow dead-space active area top housing . The benefit modify detector allows Koning modify patient exam table , achieve flat surface center . The flatter surface increase patient comfort improve workflow . Meanwhile , flat surface may also affect patient position coverage breast . The adequacy overall image quality new table/detector verified radiologist . Images ten ( 10 ) female patient ( case ) different breast size evaluate 3 independent board-certified , MQSA-qualified radiologist ( reader ) . The image acquire separate clinical trial use KBCT system new table/detector . Two reader independently evaluate image quality case choose `` accept '' `` reject '' case . If disagreement certain case , third reader independently evaluate case give final result .</detailed_description>
