	<brief_summary>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) present long-lasting decline cognitive function follow surgery . Recognized important neuropsychological complication anesthesia surgery , POCD occur predominantly elderly patient , even minor procedure . It affect 41 % patient age 60 year one week major noncardiac surgery , persist third postoperative month 13 % case . POCD adverse impact quality life , may result prolonged hospitalization increase health care cost , associate risk leave labor market prematurely dependency social transfer payment , well increase one-year mortality . Elderly patient particularly risk . Other risk factor include pre-existing cognitive impairment , cerebral , cardiac vascular disease , diabetes , alcohol consumption low level education . The occurrence postoperative delirium seem predispose patient POCD . However , POCD associate development dementia . The pathogenic mechanism lead POCD remain unclear . Numerous etiologic pathway suggest : cerebral ischemia due impair intraoperative cerebral perfusion and/or oxygenation , systemic inflammation effect proinflammatory cytokine brain , alter cholinergic neurotransmission , anesthetic neurotoxicity , hormonal change induce surgical stress , sleep circadian disturbance , genetic factor . Several study explore possible association specific genotype POCD ; however , predominantly perform patient undergo cardiac surgery carotid endarterectomy . Previous report primarily focus analysis apolipoprotein E genotype predispose factor POCD . Results study pool recent meta-analysis . Other study investigate polymorphisms human circadian clock gene HPER3 , complement , cytochrome P450 , platelet glycoprotein IIIa , phosphodiesterase 4D , P-selectin , C-reactive protein , inducible nitric oxide synthase promoter . The primary aim retrospective study available cohort data investigate specific genotype identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) may predispose elderly patient undergo major noncardiac surgery POCD .</brief_summary>
