	<brief_summary>Alcohol use almost ubiquitous college campus first-year student particularly high risk alcohol-related harm first make transition college . Peers important agent socialize healthy unhealthy behavior , despite clear role peer behavior maintenance college problem drinking , effort measure effect individual change reduction alcohol-related risk broader student body . That , despite importance social connection induce maintain alcohol use youth , intervention approach measure capitalized potential social influence change problem behavior . It essential understand indirect effect individual intervention impact intervention social structure social connection . The best way evaluate effect use research design experimentally manipulate drink use best available intervention measure effect social network member . The purpose research investigate whether use establish individual Brief Motivational Intervention ( BMI ) administer small number influential network member embed social network significantly reduce heavy drinking alcohol consequence among close peer receive intervention ( investigator call indirect intervention effect ) . In addition , investigator investigate putative social influence mechanism transmit effect , investigate specific type network connection relationships moderate indirect intervention effect , investigate effect intervention network position structure . First-year student Brown ( N = 1,280 ) enrol assess early fall 2016 academic semester . Using baseline data , dormitory ( N = 10 ) match size randomly assign one two condition : BMI natural history control ( NHC ) . Heavy drinker dormitory top quartile betweenness centrality , social network construct reflect high connectivity potential influence , either receive BMI serve control , accord dormitory 's intervention assignment . All participant assess 5 12 month baseline measure change behavior peer tie entire network first-year student . The long-term objective research understand peer influence function social network order leverage mechanisms reduce problematic alcohol use heavy drinking population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose design network analytic method allow investigator investigate extent intervention conduct careful attention network connection transmit others ( Aim 1 ) , effect occur ( Aim 2 ) , condition effect likely ( Aim 3 ) , connection change function intervention ( Aim 4 ) . AIM 1 . To investigate efficacy target Brief Motivational Intervention reduce heavy drinking alcohol consequence network member receive intervention . The investigator expect heavy drinking participant reside dormitory assign BMI receive intervention show lower frequency heavy drinking alcohol consequence follow-up comparison group NHC dormitory ( n = 480 ; 240 condition ) . AIM 2 . To identify social influence mechanism intervention effect convey . The investigator expect reduction follow social influence mechanism mediate indirect intervention effect : ( 1 ) behavioral model heavy drinking ; ( 2 ) social reinforcement drink drinking ; ( 3 ) offer provision alcohol ; ( 4 ) perception peer heavy drinking ( descriptive norm ) ; ( 5 ) perception peer approval heavy drinking ( injunctive norm ) . AIM 3 . To identify network relationship feature moderate intervention efficacy . 3A . Proximity Intervention . The investigator expect heavy drinking network member : ( 1 ) first-degree tie ( i.e. , direct tie ) intervention recipient , ( 2 ) high proportion intervention recipient close network ( i.e. , high exposure transmit intervention effect ) , ( 3 ) intervention recipient roommate show strong indirect intervention effect . 3B . Quality Peer Relationships . The investigator expect strong relationship intervention recipient measure : ( 1 ) best-friend status , ( 2 ) high perceive relationship closeness , ( 3 ) high perceive social support , ( 4 ) reciprocate network nomination , relate great indirect intervention effect . AIM 4 . To investigate intervention effect personal-level network position drinking-based selection network . 4A . Network position . Differences intervention recipient BMI NHC group follow-up investigate : ( 1 ) betweenness centrality ( often participant fall short path two others ) ( 2 ) prestige ( number nomination participant others ) . There little literature network position change follow behavioral intervention , directional hypothesis propose . 4B . Drinking-based selection . At follow-up , investigator expect less drinking-based selection BMI group compare NHC group .</detailed_description>
