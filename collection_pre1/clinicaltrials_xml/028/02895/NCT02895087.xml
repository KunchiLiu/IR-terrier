	<detailed_description>Undetectable low circulating level HIV virus blood result people diagnose HIV-infection adhere HIV AntiRetroviral Therapy ( ART ) regimen . However , ART eradicate virus body individual cease ART rapidly revert well-controlled state show high level HIV virus blood . The HIV virus show unique ability hide within human gene inside human cell tissue , remain 'silent ' rapidly reactivate [ wake ] ART stop . Efforts underway explore novel way entirely eradicate HIV individual , people HIV-infected stop treatment still undetectable HIV viral load remain well despite HIV treatment . There number way measure silent HIV reservoir , include common research-based laboratory test call Cell-Associated UnSpliced ( CA-US ) HIV RNA . This early marker HIV virus reactivate . It often use test well new drug develop eliminate silent virus might work . Recently investigator involve another clinical study , unexpected observation note group HIV study participant ART CA-US HIV RNA level time blood collection . Levels CA-US HIV RNA appear low blood sample collect earlier morning . However , time observation , investigator unable establish whether discrepancy could due ( ) diurnal variation ( ii ) unknown stress factor may experience study participant . It previously demonstrate individual untreated HIV infection variation HIV RNA level time day . However , effect external factor time day stress CA-US HIV RNA level individual ART previously examine . This study hop explore answer question ( ) Does diurnal variation play role regulating level CA-US HIV RNA blood individual diagnose HIV receive ART ( ii ) Does stress affect level CA-US HIV RNA . Understanding factor affect level CA-US HIV RNA may provide new perspective way eliminate silent virus .</detailed_description>
