	<brief_summary>In patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) lifestyles low physical activity level show increase risk hospital admission shorten survival rate . An established process increase activity level undergo pulmonary rehabilitation class . The investigator wish identify whether use activity monitor , provide feedback activity level , increase physical activity level patient COPD outside supervise pulmonary rehabilitation session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity Monitor Use COPD Patients Undergoing Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research proposal develop conjunction Respiratory Physicians Physiotherapy team deliver pulmonary Rehabilitation session . The investigator want address provide patient monitor record activity level give feedback activity level data enhances effect standard pulmonary rehabilitation program . The investigator want pay particular attention level activity outside duration rehabilitation class - see high level activity reach . This aim feasibility study do small scale issue compliance wear device monitor closely . Compliance review one week trial wearing device prior start rehabilitation session . It also enable study participant get routine wearing device , charge etc . Analysis data data collect weekday , choose 4 weekday minimum 8hrs wearing time waking hour . If device worn le 8 hour , day wear-time device select . This method choose robust statistically validate method assess activity level patient COPD . All study participant ask wear activity monitor minimise bias collect data . Subjects randomise whether receive feedback . The choice activity monitor use consider . Requirements wrist-worn data collect device able download associate computer software/ '' app '' . Wrist worn device choose compliance wear device would maximize - worn way normal wrist watch would . A model brand `` Fitbit '' select base criterion . This justified previous study show Fitbit good validity usability measure energy expenditure COPD patient . As participant study partake pulmonary rehabilitation session deviation standard care project . Analysis activity download , week , device session subject randomise receive feedback 10 minute session dedicate . There risk subject exacerbation condition/chest infection period pulmonary rehab . If subject unwell attend rehabilitation session receive feedback next attendance . Any subject hospitalise study withdrawn .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed COPD diagnosis spirometry : Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) /Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 70 % Optimised pharmacology intervention Referred Pulmonary Rehabilitation FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict Clinical instability Exacerbation precede 6 week Other clinical condition prevents mechanical exercise ( therefore participation session ) due pain/discomfort ( Arthritis etc . ) None compliant use activity monitor . Compliance assess 1 week start pulmonary rehabilitation programme ( time collect baseline data activity ) . Compliance define wear activity monitor least 85 % time allow time take charge . Recurrent chest infection &gt; 3 past 12 month . Unable consent</criteria>
