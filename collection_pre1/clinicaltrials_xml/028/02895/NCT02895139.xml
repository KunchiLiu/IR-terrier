	<detailed_description>The study divide multiple appointment investigator assess performance orthotic insole participant use . Screening Appointment ( 1 hour ) : The participant ask come orthotics department Royal Blackburn Hospital . A clinician perform routine clinical foot assessment , include take photographs foot , ensure safe participant participate study . If participant eligible able participate study , affect participant normal orthotic care . If participant eligible , information shape foot take use 3D foot scanner allow investigator produce suitable insole . Supply Appointment ( 1 hour ) : When insole ready participant come supply appointment investigator check insole shoe participant receive correct shape , design suitable wear . At appointment investigator measure pressure foot whilst walk wear insole check insole work correctly . This do use thin layer flexible sensor go participant shoe . The participant receive insole take home wear normal . After participant supply orthotic insole , member National Health Service ( NHS ) clinical team contact telephone . This week first 4 week month six month . The call last 15 minute participant ask general health , NHS foot care service may use orthotic insole . In addition 3 6 month participant receive orthotic insole ask come back clinic review appointment take approximately 1 hour . At appointment investigator measure pressure foot , use thin layer flexible sensor go participant shoe top orthotic insole . The investigator also ask participant would willing take part focus group discussion allow detailed question ask participant experience wear orthotic insole . The participant decide whether involved independent primary trial . These hold Royal Blackburn Hospital .</detailed_description>
