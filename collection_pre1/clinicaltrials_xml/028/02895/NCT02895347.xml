	<brief_title>Proficiency Based Robotics Training Curriculum : Skill Acquisition &amp; Transferability Skills Live Porcine Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project define optimal learn environment protocol dvSS® simulation activity use medical student robotic-naïve research participant . We propose accomplish goal follow aim : Specific Aim # 1 : investigate total training time total number repetition require participant achieve proficiency ( define dvSS® 91 % ) select exercise select dVSS activity . Specific Aim # 2 : measure transferability skill acquire robotic simulation live porcine model compare nonintervention control . Our study compare effect training dVSS similar nonintervention control grade suturing procedure live porcine model . Findings generate study provide new insight efficacy dVSS simulation- base train tool medical practitioner . Collectively , work build upon narrow knowledge base develop nationally accredit simulation-based robotics curriculum . Our study undoubtedly furthers GWU SMHS mission education , research , heal . The study seek understand learn curve student achieve simulation-based training directly apply train safe vivo model order determine training intervention inform robotic curriculum locally GWU throughout country . Additionally , study innovative first kind correlate skill acquire robotic-simulation gynecology base tool live porcine model . Our study seek enhance current GWU GYN robotics- curriculum assist development specific curriculum within next year . Although immediate goal plan toward gynecology robotic curriculum , result study could also inform development robotic program discipline general surgery urology . Considering , limit development simulation-based robotics curriculum , refine curriculum would allow GWU continue `` globally recognize medical center embrace challenge of…transforming health care , expand research enrich improve life serve . '' It also serve `` leverage SMHS brand enhance opportunity recognition , distinction.. &amp; marketing . '' Preparing generation well-trained confident gynecologic surgeon allow u provide safe care woman .</detailed_description>
