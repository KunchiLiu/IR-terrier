	<detailed_description>The study prospective , rater-blinded , randomize , trial , examine effect off-site self-directed training group versus individual training open surgical skill . Setting The study conduct Copenhagen Academy Medical Education Simulation , Rigshospitalet , Denmark . The study period twelve month August 2016 July 2017 . Basic open surgery training programme Copenhagen Academy Medical Education Simulation ( CAMES ) develop course basic surgical skill open surgery . The course aim junior resident start career surgery . The current course six-week course consist didactic instruction experience surgeon , expert-guided self-training self-directed training home . Each class consist eight participant . One week course start participant meet introduction . At introduction participant provide train material consist portable knot tie suture kit Ethicon , Surgical Care , Johnson Johnson write material description instrument , instruction different technical skill theoretical knowledge open surgery . The following six week participant meet week one half hour on-site class open surgical technique . The on-site class hold traditional classroom set CAMES consist didactic instruction follow expert-guided self-training . The content on-site class predefined . The participant instruct read write material on-site class . The first on-site class focus simple open surgical technique knot tie introduction instrument use . The following on-site class focus suture technique . In end course , participant introduce complex task open surgery , theory abdominal opening closure , dissection haemostasis ( Appendix B ) . The participant instructed practice technical skill present classroom home , use portable knot tie suture kit . If participant reach predefined level proficiency examination test , hold within one week last on-site class , allow participate operative course basic open surgery technique follow week . During operative course basic concept laparotomy , ligation dissection practice . The majority operative course focus practical training sedate pig . Groups three trainee supervise experienced surgeon . Participants randomize self-directed training home pair ( forty participant ) self-directed training home individually ( forty sixteen participant ) . All participant follow regular course basic surgical skill open surgery . Randomization en-bloc , participant follow course , eight participant course , randomize follow instruction . Participants inform expect take part classroom on-site class , decide much time spend practice task present classroom practice . Technical skill test At introduction participant 's technical skill open surgery assess pre-test . The test use examination end course ( post-test ) . The test compose five basic task perform simulated skin model . The task design explore technical skill three different knot-tying technique , five different suture technique knowledge select right instrument suture . The examination instruction present write format ( Appendix C ) . Participants give twenty-five minute complete task . Participants instruct distribute time task . Unlimited time give test start read instruction carefully select suture need . Tests record video . The camera place hand trainee operation field show video . Audio delete allow blind rating . To pass course , trainee must achieve predefined proficiency level correspond fifty percent ( 15 point ) maximum score ( 30 point ) post-test . The test perform CAMES assure optimal height light set every test session . Task 1 : The participant instruct close five cm wound use far-far near-near run suturing technique , 3-0 monofilament , nonabsorbable suture , anatomical forceps , start end suture use two hand knot tie technique . Task 2 : The participant instruct close five cm wound , skin model simulates fascia , ask use absorbable suture , De Bakey forceps one hand knot tie technique start end suturing . Task 3 : The participant instruct close five cm wound use subcuticular suturing technique , 4-0 absorbable suture , anatomical forceps , start end suture use instrumental knot tie technique . Task 4 : The participant instruct demonstrate three far-far near-near interrupted suture five cm wound , use 4-0 monofilament , nonabsorbable suture , anatomical forceps close suture one hand knot tying technique . Task 5 : The participant instruct close five cm wound use simple interrupted suturing technique . The participant decides suture , instrument knot tie technique use . Participants instruct show kind suture choose task camera . Training log Participants ask keep training log detail time spend train number training session . The training log contain information type task practise training perform pair . Also time spend operation room , assist perform open surgery register ( APPENDIX D ) . Every week participant meet on-site class hold CAMES , train log copy , ensure participant fill train log correctly regularly . Expert assessment Two expert surgery rating base video-recordings . One rater blind randomization ( dyad-training versus individually train ) perform video-recording . The rater teach on-site class rate examination test , therefore blind randomization post-test . However , rater still blind randomization pre-test rating perform video-recording . The Objective Structured Assessment Technical Skills ( OSATS ) use primary endpoint study . OSATS validate assessment tool evaluation general surgical skill [ 15 , 16 ] . OSATS consist five-point global rating scale ( GRS ) task specific checklist [ 15 ] . Only GRS use assessment , full procedure perform test . A modified GRS use , audio delete videos assistant available testing . Using modified GRS trainee evaluate follow category : 1 ) respect tissue , 2 ) time motion , 3 ) instrument handling , 4 ) knowledge instrument , 5 ) flow operation forward plan 6 ) knowledge specific procedure ( Appendix E ) . Handling adverse event test During test risk adverse event . They handle follow : The practical equipment fails : Testing stop . If equipment fail repairable test session , test restart point stop . If , test session see fail test session use count attempt . A new test perform . The simulated skin model become detach table : The participant allow fix simulate skin model table continue finish task . If possible , score zero give . Other interruption test : Testing stop . If interruption overcome test session , test restart point stop . If , test session see fail test session use . A test session fails due adverse event use final analysis new test session arrange . Study participants Participants medical doctor surgical interest medical student relevant job relate surgery ( internship , research year ) participate course basic surgical skill open surgery . Eighty trainee ' , sign current course basic open surgical skill , enrol study . Note : Base-line testing ( pre-test ) 15 participant carry august 2016 . These participant randomize accord protocol . No change make protocol , data analyze , since post-testing carry . The data first 15 participant obtain analyze post-test end september .</detailed_description>
