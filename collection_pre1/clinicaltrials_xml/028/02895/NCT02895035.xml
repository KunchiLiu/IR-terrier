	<brief_summary>The objective study compare maintenance intraoperative mydriasis cataract surgery two drug : epinephrine , routinely use decade , Omidria , newly FDA approve combination drug phenylephrine ketorolac . Patients undergo cataract surgery enrol trial randomly receive one drug one eye , eye receive drug subsequent cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Epinephrine Phenylephrine/Ketorolac ( Omidria® ) Additives With Regards Intraoperative Pupil Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract remain leading cause correctable blindness worldwide . Over 3.5 million cataract surgery United States 20 million cataract surgery worldwide perform every year . Cataract surgery perform make small incision , remove cataractous lens , often process phacoemulsification , replacement intraocular lens . Like surgery , adequate exposure field view vital safe effective surgery . In cataract surgery , field view limit diameter pupil . Several different drug , cyclopentolate , tropicamide , phenylephrine , epinephrine utilized maintain dilation ( mydriasis ) pupil surgery . There currently two prospective randomize controlled trial compare phenylephrine/ketorolac placebo publish literature . Both study demonstrate phenylephrine/ketorolac superior placebo maintenance mydriasis cataract surgery . Epinephrine standard care intraoperative mydriasis . Phenylephrine/ketorolac ( Omidria ) newly FDA-approved additive maintenance intraoperative mydriasis , currently publish study compare epinephrine phenylephrine/ketorolac maintenance mydriasis cataract surgery . While drug show superior placebo maintenance mydriasis , significant cost difference epinephrine , use many year , phenylephrine/ketorolac , gain FDA approval 2014 . One 4 mL vial Omidria® utilize one cataract surgery , cost $ 465 . The primary endpoint measure study mean area curve change baseline pupil diameter time end cataract surgery . Secondary endpoint maximum intraoperative pupil constriction , subject pupil diameter le 6.5 mm surgery , subject pupil less 6.0 mm cortical clean-up , subject great 2.5 mm pupillary constriction time surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients older 18 year age Patients plan undergo bilateral cataract surgery Patients baseline IOP 5 22 mm Hg Medicare insurance* There significant cost difference two study drug . Therefore , Medicare insurance part inclusion criterion , passthrough reimbursement place cover cost phenylephrine/ketorolac . Other insurance ( example , Aetna Better Health , Highmark Freedom , Gateway ) variable poor coverage phenylephrine/ketorolac , would leave medical center responsible cost . Patients never hold responsible cost medication include `` cover service '' cataract surgery billing . Patients plan undergo unilateral cataract surgery Patients plan undergo cataract surgery another surgical procedure operation ( eg . combine cataract glaucoma surgery ) Patients concurrent clinically significant disease , connective tissue disease , abnormal blood pressure screening , narrowangle unstable glaucoma treatment prostaglandin , uncontrolled chronic eye disease active corneal pathology scar Patients history iritis trauma iris damage Patients recent eye surgery ( nonlaser surgery within 3 month laser surgery within 30 day prior study surgery ) Patients clinically significant hypersensitivity study medication Patients use pilocarpine ( pupil constrictor ) within 6 month prior surgery</criteria>
