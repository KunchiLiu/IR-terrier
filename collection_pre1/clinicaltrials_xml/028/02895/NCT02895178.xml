	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect exercise program health-related physical fitness biomarkers among breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyles Of Health And Sustainability Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients survivor breast cancer present impair physical fitness various complication include acute chronic pain , severe fatigue , limited range motion , bone loss attributable anticancer treatment . Therefore , regular exercise follow cancer treatment recommend enhance physical capability relieve side-effect severity , lead improve quality life . Despite know general benefit patient cancer , effect exercise cancer-related biomarkers modulators remain unclear . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether 12-week exercise intervention improve component health-related physical fitness measure cardiorespiratory fitness , muscular exercise capacity flexibility breast cancer survivor . II . To determine whether 12-week exercise intervention improve risk parameter metabolic disease measure change body composition , waist circumference , blood pressure , circulate level glucose , insulin , lipids component C-reactive protein breast cancer survivor . III . To determine whether 12-week exercise intervention conduce change cancer-related biomarker measure serum level dickkopf-related protein 1 ( DKK1 ) , secrete frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , sclerostin , osteoprotegerin , osteopontin , growth differentiation factor 15 ( GDF-15 ) , insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) , IGFBP-3 breast cancer survivor . IV . To determine whether 12-week exercise intervention result improvement inflammatory cytokine adipokines measure serum level interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β ) , IL-10 , IL-11 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) , leptin adiponectin breast cancer survivor . V. To determine whether 12-week exercise intervention conduce change myokines measure serum level brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , IL-8 , IL-15 , fatty acid-binding protein 3 ( FABP3 ) , leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) , follistatin , fractalkine , fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF-21 ) , osteonectin irisin breast cancer survivor .</detailed_description>
