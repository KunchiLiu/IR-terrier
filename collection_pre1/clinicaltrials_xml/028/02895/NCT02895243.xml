	<brief_title>Prehabilitation Adults With End Stage Renal Disease Kidney Transplant Waitlist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prehabilitation enhancement functional capacity patient improve ability withstand future stressor . The investigator primary objective demonstrate feasibility prehabilitation Aim 1 test whether number prehabilitation session associate increased physical activity . The investigator formally test whether prehabilitation associate reduction short term long term KT outcomes part Aim 2 . The investigator test whether effect prehabilitation short-term ( KT length stay &gt; 2 week , early hospital readmission delay graft function ) long-term ( acute rejection ( within first year ) , 1 year patient graft survival ) outcomes compare standard care control . Participants follow 3-6 month receive kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
