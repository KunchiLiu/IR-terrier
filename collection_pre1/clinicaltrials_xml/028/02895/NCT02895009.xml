	<brief_title>Hemostatic Compression Patterns After Transradial Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radial artery occlusion ( RAO ) , infrequent serious complication transradial coronary intervention ( TRI ) , prevents subsequent use radial artery coronary angiography intervention . Comparing overseas counterpart , Chinese medical worker put emphasis prevention postoperative puncture site bleeding , long compression hemostasis time apply prolonged compression may underestimate even ignore increase risk RAO . Therefore , study intend compare short term TR Band compression routine long term one transradial coronary occlusion transradial coronary intervention . Participants allocate control group receive routine long term postoperative puncture site compression via TR Band . In control group , TR Band deflation commence 2nd hour successive 5 mL air release 2 hour interval bladder empty 6th hour , TR Band remove 24th hour . Participants allocate experimental group receive short term postoperative puncture site compression via TR Band . In experimental group , TR Band deflation commence 1st hour 3 mL air release , 2nd hour 5ml , 3rd hour remainder air bladder , TR Band remove 12th hour . At 24th hour , RAO incidence , postoperative puncture site bleed incidence patient comfort level evaluate .</detailed_description>
