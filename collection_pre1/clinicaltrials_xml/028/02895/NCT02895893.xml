	<brief_title>PrEP SMART Phase I Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal Phase I study conduct proof-of-concept trial contingency management ( CM ) target adherence oral HIV antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) administer via smartphone-based medication adherence platform ( PrEP SMART , `` app '' ) . PrEP provide strong preventative benefit individual at-risk HIV . While oral PrEP adherence highly correlate efficacy clinical trial , adherence rate variable range 29-80 % . In real-world practice setting , PrEP adherence may even low . As , intervention need improve sustain adherence oral PrEP , thereby maximize preventative benefit at-risk population . CM behavioral intervention involve systematic use reinforcement dependent occurrence predefined behavior . CM improve adherence antiretroviral therapy post-exposure prophylaxis , CM yet apply PrEP adherence . The investigative team recently develop smartphone-based platform medication adherence integrate CM . Given mobile technology smartphones increasingly ubiquitous , CM-based program administer via smartphone may practical intervention augments PrEP adherence . In proposed research , PrEP SMART provide medication reminder ; monetary incentive daily , verify adherence PrEP ; education oral PrEP ; assess potential adherence barrier . This 4-week open-label , stage I trial community sample young men sex men ( YMSM , n = 12 ) already prescribe take oral PrEP ( age 18-30 ) . YMSM select high risk group experience increase HIV incidence U.S . The investigative team particularly well-positioned expertise development mobile apps improve medication adherence , include context HIV care ; oral PrEP efficacy trial ; conduct research use `` parent version '' PrEP SMART ( mSMART ; Mobile App base Personalized Solutions Tools Medication Adherence Rx Pill ) platform another clinical context . The primary aim study conduct proof-of-concept trial PrEP SMART . - Aim 1a : User interaction app allow evaluation feasibility ( e.g. , number app uses/day ) - Aim 1b : Acceptability assess via self-report rating qualitative interview - Aim 1c : Medication adherence evaluate via daily smartphone camera-based medication event assessment establish preliminary data impact mSMART future efficacy trial . - Aim 1d : Adherence barrier evaluate mSMART follow missed dos .</detailed_description>
