	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common problem old people often cause significant problem think memory . Abnormal accumulation within brain protein call amyloid felt contribute impair think memory PD . Excessive accumulation protein also involved Alzheimer disease ( AD ) may influence think memory otherwise healthy old people . Recent evidence suggest change amount another brain chemical , serotonin , influence amount amyloid accumulating brain people PD otherwise healthy old people . The purpose study determine change brain serotonin affect accumulation amyloid brain . The investigator use brain imaging method measure amount serotonin amyloid brain individual PD otherwise healthy old people . PD participant undergo repeat brain image assess amyloid accumulation 2 year first brain imaging session . All participant undergo examination ass motor function , ask question assess mood thinking .</detailed_description>
