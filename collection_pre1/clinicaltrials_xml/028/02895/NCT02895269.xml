	<brief_title>COllaborative Shared Care IMprove Psychosis Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient psychotic disorder receive care traditional faith healer ( complementary alternative provider , CAPs ) set COSIMPO ( Nigeria , Ghana ) . Treatment modality healer include use herbs ritual may also involve potentially harmful practice shackle scarification . The objective COSIMPO compare effectiveness collaborative share care program CAPs PHCP improve outcome patient psychosis care CAPs facility compare usual care . A cluster randomize control trial design implement Nigeria Ghana . Patients control arm receive usual care enhance training PHCP arm , structure formal collaboration implement . Primary hypothesis : Patients present CAPs facility engage collaborative share care PHCP well outcome psychosis compare patient enhance usual care 6 month follow entry trial measure significant mean reduction symptom rat Positive Negative Syndrome scale ( PANSS ) . For purpose study , 7-point difference PANSS total outcome score two group regard clinically meaningful difference . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Persons psychosis receive treatment CAPs collaborative care program less likely receive harmful treatment subject human right abuse ( chain , beating , starve , scarification , isolation , force prolonged fasting ) receive care usual . 2 . Persons intervention arm less likely experience victimization abuse caregiver . Victimisation define act action exploit treat patient unfairly . 3 . The patient intervention arm significantly less disability control arm 4 . The provider ( CAPs PHCPs ) collaborative care program well attitude knowledge psychosis ( enhance ) care usual . 5 . Collaborative share care cost effective usual care . Setting location RCT Nigeria : The study site Nigeria Ibadan , one large city Africa . The inhabitant mostly Yoruba mix religious practice prevalent . Ibadan cosmopolitan city five eleven local government ( district ) urban remain six rural semi-urban . The population Ibadan last census 2006 1,338,659 , ( Census 2006 ) . There average 10 PHCs local government traditional health practice facility ubiquitous . All eleven local government area around Ibadan include study Ghana : The Ashanti Region locate south Ghana third large 10 administrative region . With population 3,612,950 , region account 19.1 percent Ghana 's total population ( 2010 census ) ( Awuah-Nyamekye , Samuel , Paul Sarfo-Mensah , 2012 ) . Seven district select study Ashanti basis size population require study accessible research center . Sampling frame The sampling frame cluster local government area ( LGAs ) district area select study . For purpose study , cluster consist PHC clinic neighbor CAP facility . That , cluster one PHC neighbor CAP facility , number latter determine distance , ease contact , administrative consideration . A CAP facility link one PHC PHC may one CAP facility link . A PHC well least one neighbor CAP facility must agree participate trial cluster include sample frame randomization . Power Calculations Sample size potential power trial : The primary outcome consider symptom severity assess PANSS score . Based previous study , include naturalistic follow-up study investigator , estimate mean difference 7 unit total PANSS outcome score two arm represent clinically significant difference . With target 0.33 SD , uninflated sample size 145 patient per arm require provide power 80 % alpha 0.05 . Drawing experience gain formative study , estimate , course 12 month , 10 patient per cluster recruit . To take account cluster design , estimate cluster size inflate 1+ ( ( k-1 ) *ICC ) ) k cluster size analysis ICC intra-cluster correlation coefficient . In absence previous data , conservatively estimate ICCs 0.05 ( also include between-provider clustering ) . Using result design effect 1.45 , result inflated sample size 420.5 ( 290*1.45 ) . With estimate attrition 20 % six month , total 505 need recruit . At expect recruitment rate 10 per cluster , 50 randomize cluster need trial . Informed consent participation trial : Information nature purpose study administer patient , caregiver CAPs local language aid understanding research study . All relevant consent form translate process iterative back translation local language . The language speak catchment area Yoruba Nigeria Akan-Twi Ghana . Only participants able speak either local language recruit study . The investigator particularly mindful need take extra care issue multi-site study subject otherwise vulnerable individual . With cooperation CAPs , measure take ensure privacy consent screen patient facility . For purpose confidentiality , record data store locked file room key keep site data manager . Only authourised person allow access data . Regular training ( monthly de-briefing ) research personnel issue confidentiality conduct help prevent staff violate confidentiality . Data store securely study site ( Kumasi Ibadan ) . THE COLLABORATIVE SHARED CARE The collaboration CAPs PHPCs tap skill type care provider management patient psychosis . The patient treat collaborative effort access orthodox medicine one hand complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) hand . It important note , design COSIMPO , patient belong CAPs primarily PHCP act advisory supportive capacity patient management . This patient present primarily CAPs , part , see manage CAPs facility either inpatient outpatient basis . Every aspect col-laboration therefore design enhance CAP 's acceptability delivery well care . The role PHCP help CAP provide safe , acceptable care patient , include promotion respect human right avoidance harmful practice . The PHCP also assist CAP accept provision evidence-based care patient , PHCP determine indi-cated . This collaboration promote mutual respect , trust , support , referral advice among CAPs PHCPs . Evidence-based medication prescribe trained health care person-nel . CAPs intervention arm commit implement enhance patient care collaborative arrangement PHCPs . This commitment explicitly obtain CAP prior inclusion trial . In regard , agree commit utilize arrange-ment avoid practice potentially harmful abusive engage PHCPs overall care patient refer . The frequent visit research team also use encourage reinforce commitment . As described Section 7.2.4 , CAPs intervention arm refuse implement collaborative arrangement persist use harmful/abusive ap-proaches exclude participation trial . The entry point treatment patient traditional healer faith healer ( i.e. , CAPs ) . The CAPs take responsibility patient commence treatment . The contract care pa-tient therefore lie CAP . The discretion seek clinical support refer PHCP lie CAP . The PHCP turn provide necessary support assistance need . In provide clinical support CAP , PHCP may engage CAP , patient , caregiver patient . Beyond specific referral consultation , PHCP maintain regular weekly schedule personal contact CAPs part collaboration , use contact reinforce information best clinical practice , provide information patient rehabilitation , attend clinical issue CAPs may bring attention PHCP . Main component collaborative share care The main component collaborative share care group two : 1 . Clinical support respond medical need psychotic patient : This involve provision medical care patient , especially condition acute psychotic disturbance , PHCP follow request CAP . 2 . Clinical support improve service continuous basis : This involve engagement inter-actions PHCP CAP former provide latter specific in-formation improve service , organize rehabilitation patient , generally provide good care . This interaction involve provision specific information PHCP CAP schedule regular visit full documentation . These two activity , describe , form basis evaluation collaborative care regard fidelity implementation well impact effectiveness . Clinical support respond medical need psychotic patient Intervention deliver collaboratively provider intervention arm ( CAPs PHCPs ) The intervention presume start time TP consent participate study discharge treatment ( either CAP PHCP ) . ( Patients enter study monitor evaluate outcome end primary outcome six month irrespective whether discharged treatment earlier ) . Intervention initiate CAP facility may subsequently involve PHCP facility medical facility , depend whether patient refer facility base agreement CAP PHCP . It consist treatment modality determine CAP PHCP call CAP routine engagement visit CAP . That , eligible consent patient recruit intervention arm COSIMPO treatment initiated CAP present . Some continue treatment CAP seek input PHCP care patient . Some patient CAP seek input PHCP receive treatment prescribe PHCP addition whatever treatment CAP also offer . When PHCP involve care particular patient , PHCP assess patient CAP facility , provide feedback CAP , initiate treatment accord Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide ( mhGAP-IG ) . The PHCP continue monitor patient regular visit determine clinical need patient ( example , administration specific medication may require dai-ly visit monitor effect ) . If patient herbal medication , PHCP take con-sideration administer medication . PHCP may refer patient see physician specialist , judge necessary , consultation CAP . Specified reason consultation PHCPs CAPs Based information derive formative study , COSIMPO specify follow specific reason healer consult PHCP : - Very disturbed , agitated aggressive patient - Patients risk abscond - Patients risk self-harm harm others - Patients side effect medication - Patients get well despite effort healer - Patients comorbid physical condition , fever , injury , breathe dif-ficulties ( breathlessness ) , severe throb headache , urinate excessively either day night , drink water excessively , previously diagnose hypertensive diabetic condition require medical attention . Care PHCP Once PHCP consult CAP assistance care patient , PHCP follow guideline management patient psychosis lay mhGAP-Intervention Guide figure 11 12 . The provider conduct assessment offer treatment accord procedure Guide adapt COSIMPO . Referral level care , need dictate Guide , decide PHCP implement approval CAP . The PHCP keep record interaction treatment patient ' record note book provide COSIMPO research team keep PHC facility PHCP base . The record form patient clinical narrative entry typically collect PHCPs , supplement specific form checklist capture activity include collaborative care program , design COSIMPO , form abstract study data base . The checklist include de-tails include date , time , duration visit ; psychosocial advice intervention provide ; counsel harm reduction give ; perceive receptiveness cooperativeness CAPs . Space provide write detailed note experience visit include suggestion improve collaboration . Duration treatment period follow-up This research project impose specific treatment duration period . PHC worker CAPs free select treatment duration line usual standard practice , may may influence guideline collaborative share care package . Thus , client attend primary care clinic CAPs receive usual treatment , line routine standard practice , may may influence guideline collaborative share care , whatever duration prescribe PHCP worker CAP . However , primary outcome assess 6 month follow entry study , irrespective whether patient still treatment , final ( secondary ) outcome assessment conduct 12 month recruitment . Instruments The following instrument use baseline outcome assessment : The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis disorder Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) World Health Organization 's Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 ( WHODAS 2.0 direct patient version PROXY VERSION ) Internalized Stigma Mental Illness Life Chart Schedule ( LCS ) Service Utilization Questionnaire Checklist harmful practice CAPs : Knowledge Schizophrenia Interview ( KASI ) Checklist victimization abuse caregiver : Family Burden Interview Schedule Blinding : TPs blind patient ' treatment arm ( impossible conceal fact collaboration lack patient ) . There shall two group train RAs : conducting baseline assessment conduct outcome evaluation . While former blind patient trial arm ( give RA 's conduct assessment recruitment facility get know fact collaboration lack ) , latter keep blind trial allocation . In view possibility patient may still admission facility ( recruitment occur ) 3-month assessment point , may difficult conduct particular assessment blind RAs . However , main outcome measure ( 6 12 month ) administer outcome assessor ( RAs ) independent intervention blind allocation treatment . TPs instruct disclose detail care receive outcome assessor . The primary outcome measure ( PANSS ) always complete first order minimize risk bias event unmasking assessment , occurs , point unmasking record . Sensitivity analyse carry assess effect unmask primary outcome . The intervention outcome assessment team interaction trial separate physical location administrative management . Table 13 show summary blind treatment allocation COSIMPO team member . Risks potential discomfort COSIMPO Human Subjects Protection Procedures human subject ' protection research follow guideline policy Institutional Reviews Boards ( IRBs ) -- sponsor organization , University College Hospital/University Ibadan , ethical review board College Health Science , Nkrumah , Ghana NIMH DSMB . The site investigator complete Human Participant Protections Education Research Teams sponsor National Institutes Health , U.S. Department Health Human Services . Definition Adverse Events ( AE ) Even though possibility adverse event , directly relate intervention low , critical incident register maintain study record specific serious adverse event ( SAEs ) Other Adverse Events ( OAEs ) . SAEs include : Death , due cause Any suicide attempt Any violence towards others Harmful abusive treatment practice Victimization ( violence TP ) Hospital admission due psychiatric problem Hospital admission due serious medical emergency Incarceration Events may require extraordinary response , high risk suicide attempt , rapid severe clinical deterioration Stigmatization ( due intervention ) Sexual abuse , include rape An event find potential become international incident Other Adverse Events ( OAEs ) Other adverse event ( AE ) , medical occurrence trial patient necessarily causal relationship treatment , identify . This may include follow : 1 . Clinically significant problem require hospitalization extraordinary response 2 . Onset worsen medical problem require hospitalization 3 . Other event meet criterion serious adverse event , example , report suicidal ideation without risk suicide attempt Other foreseeable risks/discomforts mitigation strategies This research study little risk discomfort . However foreseeable risk associate COSIMPO trial describe every prospective subject part standard information consent provide . Also steps mitigate risk every subject category research team would describe different category subject applicable . Response SAEs When RA detect SAEs , require information collect systematically tablet ( electronic data collection ) outcome assessment . In addition immediately report research supervisor turn report trial management , immediately inform PI within 24 hour .

Contamination Contamination minimize geographical spread randomize cluster make possibility patient move control intervention CAP facility unlikely also publicize availability collaboration intervention arm CAPs . Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis Initial analysis compare baseline characteristic individual consent consent participant could could complete baseline assessment , comparison distribution potential confounding factor . Findings report per CONSORT guideline cluster randomize control trial ( Campbell , Marion K. , Diana R. Elbourne , Douglas G. Altman , 2004 ) include trial flow chart . This include flow cluster participant stage trial , include number eligible , randomly assign , receive intend treatment , complete study protocol analyze primary outcome . The outcome measure summarize baseline , 3 month , 6month 12 month follow-ups intervention arm overall . These summarize mean ( SD ) , median ( IQR ) number proportion appropriate ( include age , gender , baseline outcome score ) , adjust cluster . For continuous outcome , histogram within arm plot order ass closely scale follow normal distribution determine describe outcomes properly inferential analysis . The cluster describe term gender , education , country site , profile CAPs ( e.g. , small vs. large ) . Outcome analyse The primary analysis intention-to-treat 6-month follow-up visit adjust baseline measure . That , randomization , patient analyze accord study arm allocation irrespective treatment actually receive . These analysis also disregard adherence intervention withdrawal trial . Random-effects logistic regression use analyze binary outcome , adjust country site cluster size random-effects variable . Analyses continuous outcome use random-effects linear regression , additionally adjust baseline value outcome . Adjustments also make a-priori defined set potential confounding variable randomization achieve balance two arm baseline . Missing data The number ( % ) complete data report . In instance method deal miss data recommend scale , use . When recommendation available , investigator employ multiple imputation fully conditional model base Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) . Imputed data use secondary analysis .</detailed_description>
