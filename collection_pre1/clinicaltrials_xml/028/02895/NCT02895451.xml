	<brief_title>Behavioral Interventions Improvement Adherence Exercise-based Cardiac Rehabilitation ( ECRA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patient include coronary care unit ( CCU ) , Linköping University Hospital , Sweden . Physiotherapists ask patient informed consent CCU book appointment exercise-based CR 2-3 week discharge baseline test . After baseline test patient randomize either extend intervention routine care . Randomization stratify submaximal exercise capacity . Patients randomize extended intervention group receive additional appointment physiotherapist within week . Thereafter patient group start exercise-based CR program , include aerobic exercise resistance exercise , 3 times/week 16 week , accord international guideline exercise-based CR . The extended intervention base component behavioral medicine include : specific goal-setting , self-monitoring feed-back . Changes endpoint variable measure baseline first ( 16 week end intervention ) second ( 12 month index event ) follow-up visit . Sample size calculation base previous clinical data similar exercise-based CR setting ( n=50 ) difference aerobic exercise capacity measure submaximal exercise test ( watt ) v finish exercise-based CR . With power 80 % two-sided significance level p &lt; 0.05 least mean difference 10 watt ( SD 20 watt ) calculate loss follow-up 20 % , estimate sample size 160 patient .</detailed_description>
