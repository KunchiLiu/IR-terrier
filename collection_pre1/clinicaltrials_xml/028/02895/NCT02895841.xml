	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn way mobile technology integrate inpatient care help well track pain level use mobile technology patient sickle cell disease , oncology patient , bone marrow transplant patient . The study ass whether daily mobile monitoring wearable accelerometer ( device detect movement well heart-rate ) monitor manage medical treatment last positive impact outcomes patient chronic disease . The investigator hop learn way mobile technology integrate inpatient care . Specifically , investigator look help patient well track pain , use wearable technology track physiological measure ( example , heart rate , sleep quantity quality ) , integrate data point medical care patient provide information provider . This study first gather information regard feasibility acceptability use technology inpatient unit . This help study team refine technology mobile app logistics integration . Following , investigator complete second phase study , select patient pilot intervention . This follow third final phase , patient randomly assign active intervention standard care . This phase approach enable study team refine intervention , rely feedback patient provider , subsequently test utility compare standard care random assignment .</brief_summary>
