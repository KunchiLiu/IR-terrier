	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Reduce Lymphedema After Breast Cancer -an Explorative Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphedema ( LE ) potential complication primary breast cancer treatment influence LE quality life well-established . To date establish treatment reverse lymphedema . Patients dependent compression garment manual lymphatic drainage prevent progression LE worsen discomfort , pain , upper limb dysfunction/sensation , skin problem infection . As development treatment tissue damage radiation treatment HBOT use treatment radiation induce mandibular necrosis , hemorrhagic cystitis proctitis follow pelvic radiation . The pathology , correlate effect HBOT include neovascularization , well organization reduction fibrous tissue , new evidence also show increase number lymphatic vessel irradiate oral mucosa . Some study find HBOT might also reduce arm edema breast cancer patient , evidence inconsistent mainly base chronic long exist lymphedema long term BC survivor . The investigator argue possibility remodel mature fibrotic tissue less pronounced lymphedema present prolong period year , limit possibility treatment success . Although HBOT lengthy time-consuming treatment , document safe aspect little risk side effect , potential health gain treatment immense . This explorative HBOT trial design generate hypothesis condition HBOT effective reduce lymphedema , reveal new aspect role tissue composition effectiveness HBOT . The early initiation HBOT key factor set , different previous study field . To able , participant randomize controlled exercise trial ( LYCA ) , develop lymphedema first year surgery invite participate HBOT trial . This trial accept regard experimental use medical oxygen pressure chamber treatment lymphedema National Health Medicines Authority 2015 ; protocol number R96- A6604-14- S22 , EUDRACT : 2015-000604-25 . Aims hypothesis The primary aim explorative trial examine whether HBOT effective treat early LE . Secondly , aim examine importance condition HBOT effective treating LE . Effects HBOT ( primary endpoint ) evaluate objective measurement affect contralateral arm volume assess DXA scan Light perometry . Changes lymphatic clearance rate HBOT ( secondary endpoint ) measure lymphoscintigraphy biomarkers inflammation collagen level blood sample . Other secondary endpoint patient report outcomes symptoms lymphedema , physical psychological function , fatigue , quality life , assess questionnaire . It hypothesize HBOT reduce volume symptom persistent LE patient receive treatment , clinically non-significant level . Furthermore , hypothesize HBOT cause reduce patient report symptom lymphedema fatigue increase physical psychological function quality life . Method The LYCA HBOT trial explorative observational study , offer participant exercise trial , develop lymphedema , treatment course HBOT . In addition , equal number match control subject without lymphedema exercise trial include blood sample DXA scan . It plan start September 2016 end last follow ( 6 month ) last participant , May 2018 . Patients invite 12 month follow-up LYCA exercise trial present follow criterion lymphedema persist 4 week : - swell arm operate side , correspond &gt; 3 % increase inter limb volume change baseline measurement - score 2 point numeric rating scale self report swelling , heaviness tightness - clinical exam 2 follow 4 criterion must present ( i-iii compare unaffected side ) : ) decrease visibility subcutaneous vein ventral low arm dorsal hand ii ) loss normal contours region medial side elbow/distal end upper arm iii ) thicker skin subcutis palpation iv ) pit edema The HBOT component : HBOT include compression 2.4 Bar ( ATA ) multi-place hyperbaric chamber Rigshospitalet . Patients breathe 100 % oxygen via transparent hood total 100 minute include two 5-minutes period de- ascent . The course treatment comprise total 40 pressure exposure , distribute 5 day week 8 continuous week . The woman encourage continue exercise 3 time week throughout treatment period , adherence exercise promote mobile phone text message . Analysis For explorative trial , power calculation carry , due explorative focus generate hypothesis . Descriptive statistic use look possible tendency , association difference . Arm volume time compare , limb volume difference woman carry progressive resistance training compare woman receive usual care control condition evaluate . Furthermore , possible association effect HBOT amount exercise examine , increase level muscle strength , symptom burden , body composition , physical function , health relate quality life . In analysis blood sample HBOT participant control subject , level biomarkers question compare contrast , baseline ( HBOT ) change time ( HBOT ) . Within group control HBOT participant , individual LYCA-exercise intervention arm .</detailed_description>
