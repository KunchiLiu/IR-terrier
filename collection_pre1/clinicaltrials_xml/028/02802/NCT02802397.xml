	<brief_summary>Early ovarian reserve decrease one main cause infertility woman 35 year . The relationship decrease exposure chemical , include persistent endocrine disruptors organic solvent , little studied . However , several vivo vitro experimental study suggest chemical may impair ovarian function . The main objective study relationship early ovarian reserve decrease exposure persistent organic pollutant . The secondary objective study relationship early ovarian reserve decrease exposure organic solvent heavy metal . Multicenter case-control study . This project permit increase knowledge concern etiology early decreased ovarian reserve . Considering exposure interest frequent , result may important public health perspective . If association observe study , result may encourage prevention strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cases control benefit , usual France concern infertility etiology examination , follicle antral count transvaginal ultrasound AMH measurement . At baseline , physicians complete short questionnaire check inclusion criterion , result measurement follicle count hormone measurement ( include AMH ) . Cases control respond self-administered questionnaire inclusion information medical history , demographic , tobacco alcohol consumption , occupation product handle workplace . Blood sample ( measure persistent organic pollutant heavy metal ) urine ( measure metabolites glycol ether ) collect baseline . Occupational exposure solvent define use job exposure matrix .
