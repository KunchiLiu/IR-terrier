	<brief_summary>The management distal radius fracture state evolution past 30 year . Treatment become increasingly focused obtain stable , internal construct quick return normal , daily activity . With advent volar locking plate , wrist fracture stable patient leave operate room . As surgical plate screw construct become stable , need cast splint may less . The presumptive `` next step '' operative management distal radius fracture away postoperative splint . A review available English language literature fail reveal study evaluate use postoperative splinting patient outcomes . This prospective , randomize study design investigate use temporary plaster splint versus removable over-the-counter split versus soft dressing post-operative treatment extra-articular intra-articular distal radius fracture . The patient follow 12 month evaluate maintenance fracture reduction patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective study use multiple surgeon multiple center ( Community Regional Medical Center Sierra Pacific Orthopaedic Center ) investigate post-operative management extra intra articular distal radius fracture treat volar locking plate . Post-operative management 2 week immediately follow surgery consist place 1/3 patient short arm , custom-made , plaster splint , 1/3 removable Velcro wrist splint , 1/3 soft dressing . The Velcro wrist brace group ask wear brace much possible two week soft dressing may remove patient third day surgery . - The custom plaster splint historical standard . The surgical incision dress non-stick gauze , 4x4 gauze pad , cotton padding , plaster splint apply palmar surface palm forearm , cloth wrap keep place . - The Velcro wrist brace commercially available over-the-counter splint initially fit thin layer non-stick gauze , 4x4 gauze , cotton padding . - Patients soft dress group non-stick gauze , 4x4 gauze , cotton padding , cloth wrap . It dress custom splint without plaster slab . Patients randomize use REDCap Randomization module consent participate study primary investigator sub-investigator . Each investigator option and/or surgery remove patient group randomize treat see appropriate . These patient would document remove study follow . Patient satisfaction evaluate subjectively PRWE ( Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation ) well Quick Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand ( Quick-DASH ) score . Radiographs take 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 week postoperatively measure fracture alignment healing . Patient report pain level , range motion , grip , pinch strength record visit well final 1 year follow-up visit . Any complication note . All visit part standard care . The additional part visit would brief survey include QuickDASH PRWE complete orthopaedic surgery resident visit . In addition first follow appointment 2 week post-surgery , patient ask satisfaction mobility wrist Velcro brace ask often wore brace .
