	<brief_summary>This single-arm pilot proof concept , open-label clinical trial . Twenty-five subject enrol 6 site . Metastatic breast cancer patient disease progression bevacizumab-alone maintenance treatment potential candidate . Bevacizumab maintenance consider six week bevacizumab treatment monotherapy last dose chemotherapy context bevacizumab plus chemotherapy first-line regimen . When progression bevacizumab-alone maintenance treatment occur , patient enter trial start receive DURVALUMAB 750 mg ( equivalent 10 mg/kg Q2W ) IV infusion , ≥ 30 kg , every 2 week together bevacizumab 15mg/kg IV infusion every 3 week . The patient undergo tumor biopsy first dose DURVALUMAB , one month combine treatment - blood sampling continue monthly basis . The treatment continue disease progression maximum 50 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abrogation Chronic Monoclonal Antibody Treatment-induced T-cell Exhaustion With DURVALUMAB Advanced HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired resistance chronic administration monoclonal antibody antiangiogenic agent like bevacizumab breast cancer cause fraction patient immune reprogramming . The immune reprogramming detect elevated count Tregs peripheral blood , aberrant pattern cytokine , elevate concentration kynurenine immunosuppressive/vasodilator prostaglandin . The addition DURVALUMAB bevacizumab-based treatment would delay abrogate change therapeutic interest scenario .</detailed_description>

Confirmed diagnosis advanced/metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer . 4 . Patients previously treat regimen contain chemotherapy plus bevacizumab first line treatment , switch maintenance treatment bevacizumab alone disease progression treatment . At least 6 week ( two dos ) must pass since last chemotherapy administration , treatment bevacizumab alone , order consider bevacizumab monotherapy maintenance therapy . Any disease progression accord RECIST 1.1 criterion timeframe consider progression bevacizumab maintenance . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 6 . Life expectancy &gt; 24 week . 7 . Adequate normal organ marrow function define : Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm3 ) .
