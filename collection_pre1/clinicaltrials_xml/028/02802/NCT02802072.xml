	<brief_title>Enterprise Stent Implantation Treatment Carotid Artery Stenosis With Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis chronic degenerative disease cause intracranial carotid artery stenosis , lead cause ischemic stroke . The currently use intervention carotid artery stenosis ischemic stroke include internal medication , carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) carotid angioplasty stenting ( CAS ) . Internal medication carotid artery stenosis mainly perform reduce risk factor cerebrovascular disease , include anti-platelet aggregation , anticoagulation , lower blood lipid blood pressure , control blood glucose improve live habit . As patient mild carotid artery stenosis , internal medication generally recommend . Carotid endarterectomy confirm gold standard treatment carotid artery stenosis . However , also limited factor include sophisticated technique , great trauma , general anesthesia , severe stroke , 9 % fatality rate , 7.6 % cranial nerve injury . In addition , carotid endarterectomy suitable patient high-position tandem carotid artery stenosis carotid artery stenosis complicate contralateral carotid artery occlusion . In recent year , CAS increasingly use treatment carotid artery stenosis patient ischemic stroke minimally invasive procedure , rapid recovery process wide indication . Enterprise stent system U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved closed loop recoverable self-expanding stent confirm highly effective treatment intracranial aneurysm . Existing evidence use Enterprise stent system intracranial artery stenosis patient ischemic stroke mainly focus case series case report . There lack randomize control trial evidence regard long-term effect Enterprise stent implantation treatment carotid artery stenosis ischemic stroke . The exist related report case series case report caveat like non-randomized , non-blinded design small sample size . Therefore , study , investigator design double-blind , randomize , drug control trial investigate efficacy Enterprise stent implantation treatment carotid artery stenosis patient ischemic stroke . Enterprise stent system novel close loop self-expanding stent make Ni-Ti alloy show favorable flexibility ease use , use approve 2009 China . The current clinical evidence regard use Enterprise stent system mainly address aneurismal treatment . In study , investigator use Enterprise stent system treat carotid artery stenosis patient ischemic stroke , important clinical significance secondary prevention ischemic stroke . In addition , long-term follow-up evidence regard Enterprise stent implantation carotid artery stenosis ischemic stroke , 3-year follow-up perform study . In study , simple antiplatelet drug use control investigate superiority Enterprise stent implantation combination antiplatelet antiplatelet medication treatment carotid artery stenosis . Outcomes study add objective , rigorous , double-blind , randomize , control long-term follow-up trial evidence Enterprise stent implantation treatment carotid artery stenosis ischemic stroke . Adverse event Possible adverse event associate Enterprise stent implantation include puncture site hematoma , vascular spasm , bradycardia , hypotension , cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome , device shifting , local ischemia , vascular occlusion , ischemic stroke , intraoperative hypertension , postoperative hypotension hypoglycemia . If adverse event occur , detail event include date occurrence , measure take related treatment , causal relationship treatment treatment adverse event report principal investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access All data collect case report form collate . Collated data input electronic database use double-data entry strategy train professional stall . Information accuracy check included patient follow . The collect data lock researcher charge alter later review . All data relate trial preserve Beijing Chao-yang Hospital , Capital Medical University , China . The electronic database fully know professional statistician statistical analysis . Anonymized trial data publish http : //www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis All data statistically analyzed statistician blind randomization use SPSS 17.0 software . The successive normally distribute variable express mean Â± SD . The non-normally distributed variable express median quartile . Classification variable express count percentage . Two-sample t-test ( normally distribute data ) Mann-Whitney U test ( non-normally distribute data ) use comparison NIHSS score Barthel index stent implantation drug group . Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use comparison carotid stenosis rate two group . A level P &lt; 0.05 accept statistically significant . Auditing Trial progression report ethic committee Beijing Chao-yang Hospital , Capital Medical University , China every 1 year trial 's status update registration database . Confidentiality Trial data include paper electronic form . Electronic data preserve dedicated password-protected computer manage data management professional . Data report paper preserve secure , locked place future viewing .</detailed_description>
