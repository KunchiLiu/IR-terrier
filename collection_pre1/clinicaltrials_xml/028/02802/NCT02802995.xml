	<brief_title>Safety And Efficacy Of Topical Platelet Rich Plasma And Thrombin Coagulum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale In normal wound healing , platelet activate macrophage produce endogenous platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) growth factor responsible would heal . In chronic wound , macrophage activation suppress lead inappropriate growth factor response cause failure positive autocrine feedback loop normally control heal process . The regular application exogenous PRP Thrombin , chronic wound , restores autocrine feedback loop tissue repair appear accelerate normal cascade tissue repair Objectives - To evaluate safety tolerability PRP/Thrombin mixture treat chronic venous ulcer - To evaluate efficacy PRP/Thrombin mixture treat chronic venous ulcer</detailed_description>
