	<brief_summary>Anorexia common symptom cancer patient associate increased morbidity mortality . However timely detection objective tool necessary establish diagnosis anorexia assess magnitude change time . The anorexia pathophysiology clearly understood treatment option limit . Anecdotal historical benefit smoke marijuana nausea , pain anorexia lead study marijuana synthetic cannabinoids Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , main active agent marijuana . The endogenous cannabinoid system receptor CB1 CB2 regulate appetite four functional level : ( 1 ) limbic system ( hedonistic quality ) , ( 2 ) hypothalamus ( appetite stimulant ) , ( 3 ) intestinal , ( 4 ) tissue adipose . Nabilone , synthetic analogue THC approve Mexico nausea vomit induced chemotherapy also use palliative care unit clinical improvement increase appetite patient terminal stage , however , clinical trial demonstrate benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Mexico world . Malnutrition often associate type cancer appear 40-50 % patient diagnosis make , affect quality life prognosis , well increased toxicity cancer treatment . Cancer anorexia characterize loss appetite main cause reduce food consumption lung cancer patient . Anorexia occur 25 % case . Unfortunately , current therapy available treat anorexia / cachexia associate cancer provide partial result , mainly intervention delay development early effective intervention still look . In patient , malnutrition associate hyporexia secondary production pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , lead increase metabolism appetite loss . Nabilone synthetic cannabinoid derivative widely use oncology antiemetic adjuvant effect pain . Although widely use treatment anorexia palliative care , randomize clinical trial demonstrate effect cancer-associated anorexia , however , animal model , stimulation cannabinoid receptor , mainly CB1 receptor modulate hypothalamic circuit brain stem , turn regulate food intake satiety . Moreover cannabinoids able block effect TNF nervous system , associate appetite change cancer patient . Additionally , agonist cannabinoid receptor attenuate weight loss murine model anorexia . Additionally , diagnosis anorexia The Anorexia-Cachexia scale ( A/CS-12 ) The Functional Assessment Anorexia-Cachexia therapy ( FAACT ) questionnaire relate difference symptom severity , assign value 0-4 12 item . A 2010 consensus special interest group CACS ESPEN ( The European Society Clinical Nutrition Metabolism ) order unify criterion , propose score ≤24 A/CS-12 would enough establish diagnosis anorexia . The administration Nabilone patient anorexia associate Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) expect increase appetite , nutritional status quality life . Methods : randomize double-blind clinical trial assess Nabilone effect non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient unresectable stage III/IV NSCLC , ECOG performance status ( ECOG PS ) 1-2 anorexia ( main criterion : score Anorexia Cachexia scale ( AC/S-12 ) Functional Assessment Anorexia Cachexia Therapy ≤24 ) . Patients randomize Nabilone 0.5mg 1mg , placebo , give daily orally 8 week . Changes evaluate baseline week 2 , 4 , 8 . Time Assessment Dose T0 Baseline 0.5mg T1 2 week 1 mg T2 4 week 1 mg T3 8 week 1 mg Sample size : To determine sample size consider effect cannabinoid ( dronabinol , 2.5 mg / 22 day ) appetite cancer patient difference proportion 34 % placebo , require 32 patient per group plus 20 % loss give u total 39 patient per group , power 90 % α 0.05</detailed_description>
