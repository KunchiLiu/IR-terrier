	<brief_title>Phase 0 Study Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine Letrozole HR+/HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer Patients ( VENTANA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VENTANA phase 0 multicenter , window opportunity , three-arm , randomize clinical trial oral metronomic vinorelbine ( VNB ) letrozole versus either treatment alone postmenopausal woman newly diagnose untreated HR+ HER2-negative , stage I-III operable breast cancer . Other eligibility criterion include primary tumor size 1 cm ( cT1-3 ) N0-1 , ECOG PS 0-1 evaluable diagnostic tumor sample . Primary objective test Oral Metronomic Vinorelbine Letrozole induce superior anti-proliferative effect either drug alone patient early breast cancer define Luminal PAM50/HER2-negative . This evaluate measure expression 11 proliferative gene contain PAM50/Prosigna® array ( BIRC5 , CCNB1 , CDC20 , CDCA1 , CEP55 , KNTC2 , MKI67 , PTTG1 , RRM2 , TYMS UBE2C ) , surrogate biomarker anticancer activity . By evaluate breast cancer-related gene signature ( 560 gene ) , antiangiogenic immunogenic potential treatment arm compare gene regulate treatment-specific manner identify . These analysis perform different PAM50-defined subtypes ( Luminal , LuminalA LuminalB ) . Clinical efficacy safety treatment also evaluate . Patients first undergo screen mandatory collection core tumor biopsy study analysis . Patients randomize ( 1:1:1 ) receive Letrozole 2.5mg daily , oral Vinorelbine 50mg 3 day week Letrozole 2.5mg daily oral Vinorelbine 50mg 3 time week . After 3 week treatment , patient undergo surgery , pre-treatment post-treatment surgery sample analyze . Alternatively , surgery delayed , tumor core biopsy collect . Anyway , post-treatment sample collect within 5 day end treatment order observe biological response . Axillar mammary surgery do accord local standard ; however , sentinel lymph node biopsy previous surgery permit . Following surgical excision , adjuvant treatment per investigator´s choice local standard care outside scope protocol . End study 28 day ( ±3 day ) last study drug dose safety follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
