	<brief_summary>Children Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) undergo several needle-related procedure outpatient visit hospital stay . It common child CF display distress behavioural problem invasive procedure . Children chronic disease low threshold pain compare non-chronic patient . Effective management needle distress child CF critical . Although pharmacological non pharmacological method use needle -related procedure low painful stimulus nearly patient CF experience anxiety . Distraction show effective technique direct child 's attention away noxious stimulus . The application Virtual Reality ( VR ) medical field show successful already 15 year ago . VR find use medication burn patient undergo cancer treatment whereas far study publish assess efficacy reduce needle relate pain distress child none child CF . Objectives To assess efficacy VR reduce pain distress venipuncture child CF compare routine care . Project description Randomized control parallel trial 1 1 allocation ratio . The use VR compare standard care venipuncture child CF ( age 6-18 year ) attend outpatient clinic CF Centre Florence compare period 1 year . Patients randomly assign arm A use VR procedure , patient assign arm B receive routine care . Anticipated output Determination efficacy VR lower pain distress venipuncture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan : Background , Specific Aims Rationale Background Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , common lethal genetic disorder Caucasians , affect 80,000 patient worldwide . Its incidence calculate occur one every 2,500 living newborn . Advances care CF patient associate impressive increase survival last 30 year . The mean life expectancy patient diagnose newborn screening approach 40 year approximately 47 % Italian patient 18 year age old . This striking result mainly due well treatment bacterial lung infection , main cause pulmonary deterioration early death patient . To efficacious early diagnose treatment fundamental importance patient routinely visit tested several time year . Tests include also collection blood sample detect monitor infection general health condition . This mean diagnose CF , child undergo least 1 blood sample per year among sample collection sputum throat swab . Antibiotic intravenous treatment uncommon patient involve position peripheral venous catheter ( pvc ) , midlines central venous access . As show previous study common child CF display distress behavioural problem invasive procedure . Like child chronic disease child CF low threshold pain compare non-chronic patient show data publish research group . In fact common belief among nurse healthcare professional child , subject repeat procedure , feel less pain high pain threshold compare child sporadically visit hospital . This misconception may lead professional low attention prevention treatment pain child chronic disease . The purpose study Bisogni compare pain perceive behavioural distress show standardized venipuncture child chronic disease already expose venipuncture , group child never previous experience venipuncture . The result show chronic child report median pain score 8 Wong numeric scale , non-chronic child report median pain score 2 . The result statistically significant indicate child subject continue venipuncture procedure low pain threshold child sex age experience venipuncture first time . This find show daily clinical practice always necessary promote effective validate technique support patient reduction pain distress especially chronic child need lifelong treatment anticipatory distress common . In fact nearly patient CF experience anticipatory pain . Anticipatory anxiety may explain condition precedes event action one think painful experience even actual painful stimulus occur . This lead child live high concern fear periodic hospital visit lead react fight , flight freeze mode acute stress response affect also parent nurse behaviour . Different pharmacological non pharmacological method already widely use needle related procedure try low pain distress . Specific Aims Rationale The primary aim study assess efficacy VR distraction technique procedure venipuncture blood test child CF regard anticipatory distress pain . The parent rating child 's fear pain nurse rating child 's distress cooperation also assess . Distraction show effective non pharmacological technique often define strategy—whether cognitive behavioral— draw child 's attention away noxious pain stimulus . Kleiber Harper draw distinction define distraction cognitive cop strategy passively redirect subject 's attention actively involve subject task . Despite widespread use , `` universally accepted theory explain function distraction '' . VR put patient different dimension allow immerge different dimension shut go around . Patients able choose among age appropriate choice VR apps . VR believe hold advantage distraction technique virtue cocoon-like equipment engage immersive nature . Set enclose headset , VR provide opportunity mental escape strategically draw individual alternative world . By control perceptual environment , patient redirect multiple sens hospital environment one involve positive entertaining activity . The application VR medical field show successful already 15 year ago . VR find use medication burn patient undergo cancer treatment whereas far study publish assess efficacy reduce needle relate pain distress child none child CF . Koller review conclude VR complex costly method hold promise effective intervention . However today cost device affordable start 6 euro cardboard device 80 Euro sophisticated headset , make technique easily implement . Several author call large sample size heterogeneous participant determine VR use effectively .</detailed_description>
