	<brief_summary>Coronary arterial disease risk factor bariatric surgery might predictor later major adverse coronary event . Diagnosis coronary arterial disease would thus desirable obese patient , however percutaneous angiography invasive procedure associate certain morbidity obese patient . In study investigator would like ass whether dual source CT angiography use diagnosis coronary arterial disease severely obese patient settings yield best image quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ECG Triggered Dual Source CT Non-invasive Pre-operative Cardiac Imaging Morbid Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity major health problem many country major risk factor cardiovascular disease . Extreme obesity treat surgery , however procedure associate certain surgery-related morbidity increase comorbidities , particular coronary disease . Thus , preoperative cardiac risk assessment would desirable , however percutaneous coronary angiography invasive procedure problem complication obese patient . A non-invasive alternative would coronary dual-.source CT angiography ( CCTA ) , however little experience exist application CCTA morbid obese patient . This study would like address follow issue : 1 . Comparison image quality coronary CT angiography use dual source CT obese patient use special protocol ( 140 kV , 350 mAs ) image historical control normal weight patient standard protocol ( 120 kV , 330 mAs ) . 2 . Prediction major adverse coronary event . Patients coronary stenosis CCTA follow major adverse coronary event ( detail see Outcomes ) 3 . Is possible detect myocardial fat reduce CT density . Images obese patient compare historical control normal patient . Furthermore , myocardial CT density correlate BMI obese patient ? 4 . Optimisation scan protocol . Increasing scan angle beyond standard 90° reduce signal noise cost temporal resolution . Various scan angle test optimal combination signal noise temporal resolution . 5 . Does long QT-syndrome improve bariatric surgery ? It assume long QT-syndrome consequence fatten myocardium . Is possible see reduction myocardial fattening thus improvement long QT-syndrome CT follow-up bariatric surgery ?</detailed_description>
