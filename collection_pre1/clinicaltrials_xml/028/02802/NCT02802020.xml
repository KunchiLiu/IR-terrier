	<criteria>Age 18 old Willing able comply study procedure followup schedule provide write informed consent participate study Chronic pancreatitis induce stricture Cremer Type IV , namely distal dominant stricture upstream ductal dilation . For patient one prior plastic pancreatic stent : VAS Pain Score Frequency Pain sector Izbicki pain scale time placement plastic stent . Availability narcotic dosage least one month prior baseline visit patient prior plastic stent availability one month prior placement prior plastic stent , applicable . VAS Pain Score 20 time study stent placement patient history pancreatic stenting . VAS Pain Score 20 time initial plastic pancreatic stent patient history one prior plastic pancreatic stent indwell 3 month less . VAS Pain Score capture via Izbicki pain scale . Pain occuring weekly frequently ( assessed Frequency Pain sector Izbicki pain scale ) . Minimum 5 mm diameter dilate duct immediately upstream pancreatic duct stricture Prior clearance pancreatic stone need If pancreatic duct stone clearance prior placement study stent include ESWL , plastic stent place immediately ESWL procedure instead leave indwell 13 month . If new pancreatic duct stone require ESWL form time intend study stent placement , patient receive study stent exclude study . Further treatment patient provide per standard practice outside study . In case study stent place session plastic stent remove , pain score need collect prior study stent placement . Prior endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy ( EPS ) , historically provide time SEMS placement applicable . Pancreatic periampullary cancer without pancreatic duct stricture cause malignancy Biliary stricture cause chronic pancreatitis Perforated duct . Ansa pancreatica Presence pancreatic cyst suspect cystic tumor require transmural drainage Duodenal/groove pancreatitis Pancreatic duct stenosis locate head pancreas Failed access attempt ERCP prior date investigational center History prior sidebyside multiple pancreatic plastic and/or history prior pancreatic metal stent ( ) Reported recent history acute relapse pancreatitis Patients endoscopic technique contraindicate . Patients currently enrol another investigational study would directly interfere current study , without prior write approval sponsor Inability refusal comply followup schedule include patient live distance investigational center attend followup visit would unusually difficult burdensome</criteria>
