	<detailed_description>Introduction : The advent endosseous implant restoration drive increase need alveolar bone preservation and/or augmentation strategy . Urist 's experiment ( 1960 's ) suggest possibility extracellular matrix protein influence bone induction ( BIP ) . Later research expand concept whole library biologics . Investigations explore physical scaffold effect wide variety bone graft material graft material offering less attractive surface bone deposition . The seed scaffold biologically active material seek enhance `` osteoconductive '' effect influence temporal sequential step result desire end product-new bone . The final desired construct graft compartment seem involve : active cell , `` conductive '' physical scaffold secondary scaffold consist mixture extracellular , structural bioactive component . Alveolar socket graft common example preservation technique . They accept procedure maximize retention alveolar bone post extraction tooth . The basic technique involve conservative approach tooth removal ( minimal traumatic extraction ) maximum retention bone socket wall . This follow curettage fibrous /infected soft tissue irrigation normal saline water . The socket fill variety calcify graft material act passive scaffold clot retention subsequent bone regeneration . ( Left ungrafted : 25 % decrease width bone first year tooth loss overall 4 mm decrease height may occur maxillary arch fourfold great loss may observe mandible . Reference Book - Contemporary Implant dentistry 3rd edition , 2008 ; Author : Misch ) . Adding secondary soft tissue scaffold ( e.g . endothelial seeding ) influence quality rate activity recent variation aim promote induction heal process might stimulate addition know bioactive agent . The current pilot research project explore addition know Bioactive Agent : Platelet Derived Growth Factor ( PDGF ) complete `` socket graft '' test impact heal response . Histomorphometric qualitative assessment utilized microscopic slide material derive core trephine initial step osteotomy preparation placement endosseous dental implant . Null Hypothesis : There difference heal response socket use A Bioactive Agent complete socket graft versus placebo . M &amp; M : Design : Split mouth RCT ( Randomized control trial ) Patient evaluation selection : Inclusion criterion : Patients select pool periodontal patient BUSDM ( Boston University School Dental Medicine ) treatment plan two extraction least one tooth apart either arch ( maxilla mandible ) follow delay 3-4 month dental implant placement . Subjects age group 20-80 year age . Exclusion Criteria : Patients know systemic disorder affect bone Example - Osteoporosis , Diabetes Mellitus , Hyperthyroidism , Arthritis , smoker pregnant woman exclude . Procedures : Standard clinical evaluation include limited pre-operative radiograph periodontal charting require . After acceptance entry study separate inform consent acquire along indexed radiograph photographs test control sit . The side assign test control decide open seal envelope side active list . Envelopes prepare advance number sequentially . After graft procedure , indexed radiograph photo take immediately extraction/graft placement , time core acquisition/implant placement , time implant abutment ( usually 3-4 month post placement ) . Patient follow clinically 1 year monitor post op sequela . Graft Procedure : At time extraction site ask rinse 0.12 % Chlorhexidine , anesthetize 2 % lidocaine 1/100,000 epinephrine . Extraction do usual standard care preserve socket wall . Sites require socket wall repair time extraction exclude study . Sockets measure 4 line angle depth periodontal probe , Buccal-Lingual dimension measure prior graft placement . Graft material ( mineralize cortical/cancellous Bone Powder 250-1000µ ) use site . Volume graft use record . Both site fill slightly marginal bone level ( 1mm ) . Test site inject Bioactive Agent . At 3 level apical 1/3rd , middle 1/3rd coronal 1/3rd . Control site inject saline ( vehicle ) level . Occlusal orifice close Collagen plug adjust depth meet free gingival margin suture 4-0 Polyglactin ( Vicryl ) Post op care : Sites check photographed 1 week , 2 week ( suture remove ) clinical photo take monitor clinical sign inflammation heal . A 3-month post op radiograph appointment make 2-week visit . Ct scan may take prescribe treatment plan/ prior implant placement . Implant/core acquisition time Implant placement : Clinical photograph take . ( Post graft radiograph already do 3 month ) Site open standard full thickness flap entry . After soft tissue reflection photo take implant site mark standardized round bur ½ depth bur ( ~ 0.5-1.0 mm ) . Sites require 4 , 5 , 6mm implant trephine core first step osteotomy ( 3.3mm OD-2-8mmID ) Trephine center site mark osteotomy prepare prescribed depth . The trephine core photograph periodontal probe include reference length , apical end mark India ink place 10 % neutral buffer formalin ( NBF ) label patient name , date , record # length core . Details implant placement record size implant insertion torque record . Post-implant care : Standard care post op sequence follow , adequate healing period elapse heal cap screw onto implant remove replace appropriately shaped abutment . The entire procedure photograph usual post abutment radiograph take time . Outcomes : The follow outcome measure : Clinical Observation : Loss particles one week ( measure depth center socket orifice periodontal probe ) Closure socket orifice ( pre post measurement periodontal probe ) Microscopic measure make H &amp; E ( Hematoxylin Eosin ) TRAP ( Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ) 6-u section along vertical axis core contiguous field 100X Quantitative : - Measures Total Mineralized compartment - Total Bone ( TB ) - Measures residual graft material/ area ( GP ) - New bone formation ( NB ) = TB - GP - Measures vascular content - Arteriole , Venule , Area , Size , Number - Osteoclast count - TRAP stain Qualitative : -Measures marrow component ( Cells relative fiber/ fat content , liner cell characteristic . ) Laboratory Preparation : Cores deliver process technician name , location date acquisition , pre -processing measure length crestal/apical orientation . Identity core mask process number technician allow blind evaluation . The coded list store require . Cores decalcify EDTA ( Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid ) , prepare stain H &amp; E Trap . Histomorphometric analysis : Paraffin block cut parallel long axis core 6 micron serial section . The first 500 micron core ( ¼ core diameter ) remove achieve section width 2-2.5mm . This allow slightly 1 field diameter 100X light microscope . The next quarter core cut 3 ribbon 21 section 1rst , 10th , 20th section ribbon mount slide H &amp; E ( Hematoxylin Eosin ) staining . A parallel series three slide use 2nd , 11th , 21st section ribbon mount TRAP stain ( tartrate resistant acid-phosphatase ) . Three ribbon three section per ribbon yield 8-9 section per specimen evaluation maximum distance section 60 u total ~360 u width sample . The remainder block save . The number cod slide submit evaluator measure bone ( total bone area ( TB ) , graft particle area ( GP ) number , area , type blood vessel ( Arteriole vs Venular ) . Qualitative evaluation make marrow content ( Fat vs Fibrous ) status liner cell population ( heavy brick like thin stretch ) osteoclast count do hand count TRAP stain slide move step 100 X evaluate right left side field 200X Measures bone area/field ( New bone = Total bone - graft particle size ) , vascular content ( Vascular content measure type , area , diameter per field ) osteoclasts make contiguous step 1.5-2mm along vertical axis core crestal end apical end . ( This result 3-4 step core along vertical ) Measurements make 100X Image Pro Plus version 4.51 similar bone vascular measure 200x osteoclast . Statistical Analysis Measures After analysis preliminary measure code list accessed patient ID pair identify analysis respective group . Summary descriptive statistic table use comparison display data . Paired test evaluate mean test versus control side continuous data chi-square categorical data .</detailed_description>
