Elderly , especially spouse , informal caregiver also expose common chronic disease associate polypharmacy high risk develop drug-related problem due age negligence health care . These risk increase mainly elderly change pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter related aging , acute chronic disease potentially inappropriate prescription ( PIP ) . Previous study show effectiveness positive impact optimization therapeutic clinical pharmacist reduction drug-related problem , length hospital stay , readmission rate , quality life mortality . The patient 's medication management usually delegate informal caregiver , must also manage treatment . The caregiver may face difficulty therapeutic ( e.g. , inappropriate dosage form , adverse effect patient refusal ) could impact compliance treatment relative . No previous study evaluate impact pharmaceutical collaborative care include personalize interview clinical pharmacist optimization drug prescribing among patient ADRD caregiver . However , many study assess effectiveness non-pharmacological intervention caregiver burden , mood disorder patient institutionalization . Meta-analysis show moderate improvement caregiver burden .
