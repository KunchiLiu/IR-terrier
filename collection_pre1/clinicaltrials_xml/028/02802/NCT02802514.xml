	<brief_summary>The drug effect study single dose 50 milligram ( mg ) albiglutide single dose 10 microgram exenatide , gain insight central mechanism nausea associate Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) agonists . This study explore potential difference expect time maximum concentration ( Cmax ) long-acting ( albiglutide ) short-acting ( exenatide ) GLP-1R agonist brain activation healthy volunteer assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This phase IV , 2-part , 2-period crossover ( session ) , single dose , randomize , single blind ( blind subject image evaluator analyse MRI data ) , placebo- active-controlled study adult healthy volunteer susceptible motion sickness . Part A Part B design , consist screen stage , dosing/assessment stage , follow-up visit . Data Part A inform progression , method , analysis plan Part B . Each sequence include three scan visit : albiglutide plus scan , exenatide plus scan off-therapy -natural history scan 6-9 week washout period dose scan . A total 24 28 subject randomize study ( Part A Part B ) . The cross design divide 2 session schedule follow , Day 1 ( either Session 1 ( S1 ) Session 2 ( S2 ) per , randomize ) subject go off-therapy MRI scan , Day 5 subject receive single dose 50 mg albiglutide albiglutide placebo , Day 8 subject receive single dose 10 microgram exenatide saline placebo follow post-dose MRI scan . At session subject receive one active drug ( albiglutide exenatide ) .</brief_summary>
