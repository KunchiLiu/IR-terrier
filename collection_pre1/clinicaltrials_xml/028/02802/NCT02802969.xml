	<detailed_description>Due close contact lesion neurovascular structure , case skull base chordoma mobile spine , surgery often incomplete . On contrary , surgery sacral region ( block excision often possible ) bring well therapeutic outcome . Radiotherapy high-dose supplement improve outcomes lesion . Intratumoral hypoxia primary factor radioresistance , 's know since long radiation oncologist . [ 18F ] FAZA give image hypoxic volume target . Investigators propose increase radioactive dose hypoxic volume target order succeed , radiation oncologist precisely identify hypoxic volume . Radiation oncologist would increase 10 % radioactive dose allow u improve local control 3 year 15 % without additional side effect .</detailed_description>
