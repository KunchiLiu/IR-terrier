	<brief_summary>This pilot double-blinded placebo-controlled randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate feasibility conducting multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy pre-transfusion furosemide prevent transfusion-associated circulatory overload ( TACO ) hemodynamically stable inpatient age 65 year old receive single unit red blood cell transfusion . Patients randomly allocate receive either furosemide ( 20mg intravenous ) placebo ( saline ) within 60 minute start red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . Randomization stratify centre renal dysfunction ( creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min &lt; 60 mL/min ) . This blinded trial : patient , care-providers ( physician nurse ) , data collector , outcome adjudicator , data analyst aware group allocation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose pilot study assist u determine feasibility conduct definitive multicenter randomize trial across Canada . Rationale : The rationale study include : ( 1 ) TACO lead cause morbidity mortality due transfusion ; ( 2 ) risk factor TACO include old age , renal dysfunction positive fluid balance ; ( 3 ) furosemide diuretic commonly prescribe fluid overload ; ( 4 ) furosemide decrease pulmonary artery pressure ; ( 5 ) clinical uncertainty effect furosemide prevent TACO . The investigator enroll 80 patient pilot study two center . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize 80 patient enrolled trial within 2-month period Justification : If pre-transfusion furosemide decrease rate TACO red blood cell transfusion , clinical practice worldwide would change . Over 800,000 patient Canada receive blood transfusion annually many high risk TACO may benefit simple , low-cost intervention . This intervention could easily generalizable worldwide . There practical challenge relate patient recruitment , adherence trial protocol data collection , TACO-BEL Pilot Trial seek measure . Objectives : The primary outcome trial determine feasibility perform large multi-centre , randomize , placebo-controlled trial conceal allocation blind outcome assessment , adequately powered determine clinically significant effect pre-transfusion furosemide incidence transfusion-associated circulatory overload . Primary outcome measure number patient enrol within two-month period Secondary feasibility outcome measure include : 1 . Proportion patient screen meet eligibility criterion 2 . Proportion eligible patient consent participate 3 . Proportion consent patient receive allocate treatment 4 . Proportion treat patient complete follow-up assessment 5 . Proportion patient blind maintain throughout study Research Method : Patients meet inclusion criterion identify review transfusion order receive blood transfusion laboratory referral order physician ; patient approach study personnel obtain pre-transfusion informed consent . Randomization perform pharmacy time drug preparation . The randomization code generate random block 4 6 , stratify center , renal function time randomization ( creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ≥ 60 mL/min ) use computer base randomization program . Intervention : Patients administer bolus dose 20mg furosemide ( 20mg/2mL ) intravenously within 60 minute prior start red blood cell transfusion . Patients randomize placebo administer equal volume normal saline intravenously immediately within 60 minute prior start red blood cell transfusion .</detailed_description>
