	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy 12-week low-load neuromuscular electrical stimulation volitional contraction ( NMES-VC ) training program improve quadriceps strength activation , adversely affect knee-related pain , activity daily live quality life woman knee pain . The primary outcome change maximal isokinetic knee extensor torque . The investigator test follow hypothesis . In comparison low-load ( 40 % ) resistance training without electrical stimulation , 12-week NMES-VC training program : Hypothesis 1 : Increase maximal isokinetic knee extensor torque Hypothesis 2 : Increase rate muscle force development Secondary question response variable Hypothesis 3 : Not adversely affect knee pain quality life , assess Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire Additional hypothesis woman risk factor incident symptomatic progressive KOA : 1 . Determine extent NMES-VC-enhanced low-intensity resistance training increase quadriceps muscle rate force development 2 . Determine extent NMES-VC enhance low-intensity exercise tolerate ( use numeric rating scale survey `` level pain experience hybrid train 40 % isokinetic exercise '' ) 3 . Determine extent NMES-VC-enhanced low-intensity resistance training increase physical function ( 20m walk , chair stand , stair climb time , KOOS ) 4 . Determine extent NMES-VC enhance low-intensity resistance training increase pressure pain threshold</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Application Electrical Stimulation Volitional Contractions Muscle Strengthening Knee Pain Inhibition ( Seated Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthritis common cause disability United States . Approximately 42.1 % woman 31.2 % men age 60 knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) . KOA associate pain , quadriceps weakness , swell , instability , decline range motion , physical function , quality life ( QOL ) . The presence KOA significantly decrease QOL , quadriceps strengthen ability improve QOL . However , one challenge strengthen knee pain influence muscle strength physical function . Not quadriceps strengthen also reduction knee pain may necessary reduce functional limitation KOA . However , time , insufficient evidence regard effective training increase quadriceps strength also reduce knee pain improve neural function . Thus , need interventional study build observational finding evaluate relationship neural function , knee muscle strength , knee pain , physical function . The critical barrier study whether quadriceps strengthen protective worsen physical function lack effective strengthen program people elevate risk KOA . Factors place old adult elevate risk symptomatic KOA , ( e.g . sedentary lifestyle , obesity , knee pain , knee injury surgery ) , may also contribute reduce tolerance high load quadriceps strengthen program . If well-tolerated effective mean strengthen could identify , may also additional benefit reduce knee pain , improve physical function avoid disability individual risk KOA . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) widely use strengthen muscle improve function people exercise medium-high intensity . For KOA , NMES effective enhance quadriceps strength , knee pain , physical function . Therefore , NMES could contribute decreased neural inhibition knee pain promote muscle function ( e.g . muscle strength , power , contraction speed , co-contraction ) . Recently , report combined application NMES volitional contraction ( NMES-VC ) effective make limitation NMES . NMES-VC could help improve motor recovery . The result recent study suggest hybrid training system utilizes volitional contraction NMES simultaneously , might effective method improve physical function strengthen muscle relieve knee pain people risk incident progressive symptomatic KOA . This line research could significant positive impact public health , lead introduction inexpensive mean well-tolerated safe exercise complete community rehabilitative environment . Successful completion initial investigation enable pursuit research determine whether NMES-VC effective quadriceps strengthen pain relief improve neural function symptomatic progressive KOA . Reduction primary cause disability cost-effective preventive exercise high potential reduce burden disease disablement , thereby improve quality life old adult significantly reduce cost individual society . The specific aim propose research ass efficacy twelve-week , efficient tolerable , low-intensity exercise program NMES-VC improve quadriceps strength rate force development , knee pain physical function woman risk factor incident symptomatic progressive KOA . This specific aim achieve randomize , control trial , compare low intensity exercise without NMES-VC . This research novel first use low load regimen minimize potential adverse load knee joint still high likelihood lead clinically meaningful strength gain , pain relief physical function improvement old adult elevate risk symptomatic progressive KOA .</detailed_description>
