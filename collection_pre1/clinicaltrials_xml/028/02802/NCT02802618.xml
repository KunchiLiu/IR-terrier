	<brief_title>Interactive 3D Visualization Technique Used Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one major health scourge . In 2002 COPD fifth lead cause death estimate show COPD become 2030 third lead cause death worldwide . The dominant cause COPD tobacco smoking . COPD affect men woman almost equally . The common symptom COPD breathlessness , excessive sputum production , chronic cough cause decrease health relate quality life ( HRQL ) . Dyspnea movement limitation also common symptom patient COPD often lead reduced level physical activity , physical capacity HRQL . The Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) valid evaluation tool HRQL patient chronic cough . Currently specific cough questionnaire exist Swedish . Pulmonary rehabilitation include education exercise train improves health . The Physiotherapy department conduct rehabilitation program patient COPD since 1995 . The COPD-program several time update accord exist evidence . Education anatomy , physiology , physical therapy self-training big part physical therapist 's workday . The education impart complex knowledge . It demand mediate education expect raise patient 's desire understand , create opportunity understand leave lasting impression . In effective learning repetition , search information , stimulation , emotional impact experience important factor . Information technology develop rapidly patient 's use technology increase . It therefore essential education adapt new requirement . Interactive 3 dimensional ( 3D ) visualization technique use represent human body . Interactive 3D technique use patient education yet study . A new education material 3D technique develop , integrate 3D technology exist evidence-based pulmonary educational program , enable increase personalized education within group set . The investigator believe educational model lead increase adherence treatment , suggest lifestyle change , turn improve patient ' HRQL In current study investigate whether och difference pulmonary educational program interactive 3D visualization technology conventional technique patient COPD . Furthermore LCQ translate culturally adapt Swedish test validity reliability .</detailed_description>
