	<detailed_description>Introduction Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( PDT ) routinely perform intensive care unit world number indication , : airway obstruction , need long-term respiratory support , improvement trachea-bronchial toilet , prophylaxis head neck procedure , case severe obstructive sleep apnea poor neurological state . Several study show procedure safe economically efficient comparison open surgical tracheostomy operate room . In many place around world customary perform procedure direct vision via bronchoscope prevent damage adjacent structure , ensure correct position tracheostomy tube , avoid damage posterior wall trachea confirm final position tube . However , use bronchoscope depend availability equipment knowledge skill operator . Use bronchoscope procedure may also result complication temporary occlusion trachea hypercarbia increase duration procedure . Maintenance bronchoscope also carry associate cost ( disinfection , replacement , etc. ) . A retrospective review 243 percutaneous tracheostomy do trauma patient January 2007 December 2010 78 ( 32 % ) perform bronchoscope 168 ( 68 % ) without , find difference group 4 . Another retrospective study 5 look percutaneous tracheostomy do without bronchoscopic guidance , analyze 300 PDTs show 26 patient ( 8.6 % ) complication , include : 2 ( 0.6 % ) patient deteriorate neurologically 2 ( 0.6 % ) death observe within 24 h following procedure . The median operating time 3.5 min ( range , 2.5-8 min ) . There cannula placement problem case . A retrospective study look 512 bronchoscopy guide procedure 10 year conclude : Eighteen patient ( 3.5 % ) present procedural complication . Five patient experienced transient desaturation , 4 present low blood pressure relate sedation , 9 present minor bleeding , none require transfusion . No serious complication death associate procedure record . Eleven patient ( 2.1 % ) present post-operative complication . Seven present minor transitory bleed percutaneous tracheostomy stoma , 2 suffer displacement tracheostomy cannula , 2 develop superficial infection stoma . In investigator 's institution number institution country abroad , acceptable perform operation either withdraw endotracheal tube position near vocal cord direct laryngoscopy puncture trachea needle distal endotracheal tube , prior carry PDT , location anatomy palpation neck , alternatively entire procedure bronchoscopic guidance . So far , systematic comparison make two method ie PDT without bronchoscopy versus PDT bronchoscopy .</detailed_description>
