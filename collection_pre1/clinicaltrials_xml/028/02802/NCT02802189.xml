	<brief_title>The Effect Integrated Neuromuscular Inhibition Technique Combination With Therapeutic Exercise Patients With Chronic Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain one common costly musculoskeletal disorder Western society , witness high prevalence repeatability chronicity . In chronic mechanical neck pain , change neck area , due muscular imbalance deep neck flexor ( longus capitis longus colli ) superficial flexor neck ( sternocleidomastoid anterior scalene ) . Therapeutic exercise play key role restoration muscle imbalance , comprise combination resistant endurance training . The integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique ( INIT ) manual deactivation trigger point technique include application ischemic pressure stretch , muscle energy technique Strain-counterstrain technique . The aim research investigate whether application INIT combine exercise reduce time require establish benefit train improve faster great extent clinical figure quality life patient chronic neck pain . Method . Single blind clinical trial last 10 week , 40 participant ( men/women ) chronic mechanical neck pain . Participants divide two group , follow exercise program . The first group ( experimental ) follow exercise programme combination integrate neuromuscular inhibition technique ( INIT ) , second ( active comparator ) apply program exclude INIT technique . The subjective perception pain visual analogue scale , functionality relate neck pain neck disability index , ppt neck muscle pressure algometry , active range motion bubble inclinometer , maximum isometric strength neck muscle hand dynamometer , muscular fatigue flexor neck special test quality life sf-36 questionnaire evaluate , intervention , follow-ups take place one , three six month later .</detailed_description>
