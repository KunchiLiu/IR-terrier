	<brief_summary>To date , valid reliable pressure pain threshold scale use research clinical practice . The exist manual palpation protocol scale limit support literature knowledge advance since scale propose 1990 's . Therefore , purpose investigation develop valid reliable PPTS order provide objective mean assess pressure pain threshold create reliable method communication among clinician individual diagnosis characterize MPS FM . These condition choose base high prevalence among chronic pain condition also dependent upon manual palpation examination diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Pressure Pain Threshold Scale Patients Diagnosed With Myofascial Pain Syndrome Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose investigation develop valid reliable PPTS order provide objective mean assess pressure pain threshold create reliable method communication among clinician . Eighty-four participant ( N=84 ) enrol study assign three group : FM ( N=28 ) , MPS ( N=28 ) , control group ( N=28 ) . Participants recruit three site . All participant age 18 65 year meet inclusion criterion 1 3 group . All participant require read , speak write English need complete form consent . The following criterion group follow : 1 . Control group : Individuals current prior diagnosis consistent MPS FM . No current injury integumentary abnormality designate palpation site . 2 . MPS group : Individuals diagnosis MPS meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) diagnostic criterion FM . No current injury integumentary abnormality designate palpation site . 3 . FM group : Individuals meet criterion diagnosis FM base upon ACR diagnostic criterion . No current injury integumentary abnormality designate palpation site . Prior test , participant fill screen questionnaire question represent exclusion criterion use determine ineligibility study . Participants meet inclusion criterion consent participate enrol study . A California State University Dominguez Hills approve consent read sign participant prior begin data collection . Following consent , participant fill questionnaire provide demographic information include age , height , weight , arm dominance . Following completion paperwork , participant underwent test primary investigator conduct hour 8 2pm . Participants instruct refrain take related medication ( e.g . pain medication ) prior test . All participant underwent test procedure blind examiner 's score participant enrol study . For reliability portion study , total 20 participant ( 10 MPS/FM 10 control group ) undergo 2 day test . Each test session last approximately 45 minute . After reliability portion complete , recruited subject underwent 1 day test last approximately 45 minute . The test process consist 2-parts base upon American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) diagnostic criterion FM . The protocol require examiner apply pressure 18 pre-determined 2 control point 4kg/cm2 rate 1kg per second total 4 second point , one time.12 , 13 For Part I , examiner apply gradually increase pressure use thumb digital pressure sensor pre-determined tender point . For Part II , examiner apply gradual increasing pressure use algometer pre-determined tender point . For Part I II , participant record level discomfort tender point use MTPS VAS pain scale examiner reach 4kg/cm2 pressure maximum level pressure felt . Participants able stop testing time . The examiner simultaneously record patient 's response use PPTS scale tender point . Collected data transfer SPSS v.22 ( IBM SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . Means , standard error mean ( SEM ) , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , range descriptive data group calculate . Group differences calculate use independent t-test . Six clinical question measure investigation require specific parametric non-parametric ( ordinal data ) statistical calculation . The P-value consider significant .05 level use two-tailed test ( Î±2 =.05 ) clinical question .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Control group : Individuals current prior diagnosis consistent Myofascial Pain Syndrome ( MPS ) Fibromyalgia ( FM ) . MPS group : Individuals diagnosis MPS meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) diagnostic criterion FM . FM group : Individuals meet criterion diagnosis FM base upon ACR diagnostic criterion . Current neurologic condition ( e.g . Multiple Sclerosis ) Current metabolic condition ( e.g . Diabetic Neuropathy ) Current systemic condition ( e.g . Rheumatoid Arthritis ) Any skin connective tissue problem ( e.g . Marfan Syndrome ) Current symptom numbness , tingle , burning , coldness , pain back , hand , foot . Any prior surgery may affect ability participate study . A pacemaker electrical implant may affect electronic equipment . Currently take medication may alter subject 's sensation affect ability participate study . Current shingle postherpetic neuralgia . Current open skin wound neck , arm , back , leg Current injury designate palpation site . Currently medical condition limit function might affect participation . The ability tolerate test duration procedure . The ability understand complete consent form questionnaire .</criteria>
