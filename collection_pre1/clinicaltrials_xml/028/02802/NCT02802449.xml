	<detailed_description>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES Three hundred thirty ( 330 ) overweight , pre-hypertensive/controlled hypertensive , African-American participant enrol 8 week study assess effect two administration Vitamin D3 Vitamin D serum responsiveness function clinical , biologic genetic factor . The investigator anticipate least 300 participant complete study . Written , sign date informed consent participate study give participant legally acceptable representative , accordance International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) Guideline E6 applicable regulation , complete study-related activities/procedures . The original sign dated consent keep subject 's research file copy give subject . A copy also place medical record . Blood Pressure Control Controlled High blood pressure entry criterion , outcome . However , investigator want exclude potential participant likely poor BP control study . Therefore , although patient pre-hypertension hypertension eligible enter study , protocol allows enrollment participant well-controlled hypertension define SBP≥ 120 mmHg DBP ≥ 80 mmHg treatment , SBP &lt; 160 mmHg DBP &lt; 100 mmHg regardless whether treatment . BP care manage participant ' primary provider . All participant actively treat hypertension pharmacotherapy receive direction adhere medication follow-up Primary Care Physician . Patients poorly control diabetes define hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8.5 % advanced kidney disease define eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min exclude . After study conclude , participant encourage supported address issue diet exercise may reduce risk hypertension . If BP medication need adjust , participant refer back Primary Care Physician . Visit 1 SCREENING The screening period allow determination appropriateness subject 's inclusion study . Written inform consent subject legally authorize representative would obtain prior study-related procedure perform . In addition sign general informed consent , subject agree participate sub-study fat biopsy sign second informed consent . The subject assign screen number contact regard eligibility screening procedure perform laboratory result receive . The following evaluation assessment perform Screening : inclusion/exclusion criterion , medical history ( include demographic concomitant medication , include prescription , herbal/vitamins , over-the-counter medication ) , vital sign ( sit BP , heart rate ) , mini physical examination ( include height ( cm ) , weight ( kg ) , waist circumference ( cm ) body mass index ( BMI ) calculate clinical heart/lung examination . Blood drawn ( 15 cc ) full biochemistry panel glucose ( mg/dl ) , complete blood count , HbA1c ( % ) , calcium ( mg/dl ) , phosphorus ( mg/dl ) , albumin ( mg/dl ) , pregnancy test 25 ( OH ) D ( ng/ml ) level . After screen information review deem appropriate inclusion study , eligible subject give appointment preparatory instruction Visit 2 ( Baseline/Randomization/Dose # 1 ) include smoke ( smoke ) , eat , drink caffeine least 8 hour prior Baseline Visit . If participant take prescribed medication ask bring advise take prescribed . Visit 2 BASELINE/ RANDOMIZATION/ STUDY DRUG DOSE # 1 ADMINISTRATION If subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize . The participant ask adverse event change medication , include prescription , herbal/vitamin , over-the-counter medication . Vital sign ( sit BP , heart rate ) obtain nutritional survey administer . Blood drawn ( 45 cc ) serum calcium ( mg/dl ) , phosphorus ( mg/dl ) , albumin ( mg/dl ) , iPTH ( pg/ml ) 1-84 PTH/7-84 PTH ratio , pregnancy test , 25 ( OH ) D ( ng/ml ) level ; sample store bio-markers ( e.g . pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic/fibrotic , insulin sensitivity , vitamin D receptor polymorphism ) . Spot urine sample ( 30cc ) collect calcium/creatinine albumin/creatinine ratio well sodium isoprostanes . The fat biopsy perform agree part subgroup . Participants undergo fat biopsy give post biopsy instruction include return appointment 7-10 day . Visit last 30-60 minute participant . At end visit , participant randomize either give two 50,000 IU tablet oral Vitamin D3 [ also know cholecalciferol 25 hydroxy-Vitamin D3 25 ( OH ) D3 ] two tablet Placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) take direct observation . All participant give appointment preparatory instruction Study Visit 3 . They also give introduction avoid vitamin D supplement study period . Visit 3 STUDY DRUG DOSE # 2 ADMINISTRATION ( 2 week baseline ) Visit last 15 minute participant . Participant ask adverse event change medication , include prescription , herbal , over-the-counter medication . Vital sign obtain . Participant give second dose either two 50,000 IU tablet oral Vitamin D3 two tablet Placebo take direct observation . All participant give appointment preparatory instruction Study Visit 4 ( Week 6 ) . Visit 4 ( Week 6 ) During visit participant ask adverse event include possible symptom vitamin D overdose change medication , include prescription , herbal , over-the-counter medication . In addition , follow evaluation assessment also perform : vital sign ( sit BP , heart rate ) . Blood drawn ( 3 tablespoon 45 cc ) full biochemistry panel , glucose ( mg/dl ) , HbA1c ( % ) , complete blood count , calcium ( mg/dl ) , phosphorus ( mg/dl ) , albumin ( mg/dl ) , iPTH ( pg/ml ) 1-84 PTH/7-84 PTH ratio , 25 ( OH ) D ( ng/ml ) level ; store sample bio marker ( e.g . pro-inflammatory/pro- thrombotic/fibrotic , insulin sensitivity , vitamin D receptor polymorphism ) . Spot urine sample collect calcium/creatinine albumin/creatinine ratio well sodium isoprostanes . Urine pregnancy test also do . Participants undergo fat biopsy give post biopsy instruction additional 7-10 day follow-up . Visit 5 End Study ( Week 8 ) At End Study visit ( EOS ) , participant ask adverse event include possible symptom vitamin D overdoes . In addition , follow evaluation assessment also perform : vital sign include sit BP heart rate . The result lab previous visit discuss abnormal lab value , participant refer primary care physician management .</detailed_description>
