	<detailed_description>Background Breast cancer common cancer female , 85 % woman survive disease 5 year . Chemotherapy form significant part many patient 's treatment associate various common , well-characterised adverse effect . For last decade , physical activity emerge viable intervention help many adverse effect chemotherapy . Studies look patient 's preference show majority prefer walking , moderate-intensity , home-based exercise . Previous small study show cancer doctor considerable influence exercise behaviour ; simple recommendation significantly increase activity level newly diagnose breast cancer patient commence treatment . A question study also assess effect exercise marker chronic inflammation blood . Exercise know reduce inflammation may play significant role cancer . Method The study determine provision 12-week tailored walking programme , provide alongside home-based exercise prescription cancer doctor result improved level physical activity patient breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy . Secondary objective assess patient-reported activity , quality-of-life , completion rate chemotherapy , cognitive function , anxiety depression level , body composition well explore role effect specific marker chronic inflammation blood . The investigator recruit 100 patient LRI undergo chemotherapy breast cancer . Participants allocate either intervention standard care group study . Those intervention group receive walk programme various motivational strategy incorporate well discussion benefit exercise prescription cancer team . Those standard care receive intervention material . All woman wear wrist accelerometer ( measure activity level ) 12-week period complete assessment point ( well follow assessment 6 month ) . Assessments include study questionnaire , cognitive testing , measurement body fat blood test . Potential impact The investigator aim show intervention result significantly improve level physical activity , well improve quality life improvement secondary outcome measure . They also predict intervention result significant lower inflammatory marker concentration compare standard care . The study provide important addition evidence exist cancer team encourage patient survivor meet national physical activity guideline . In long term , intervention test propose study potential inexpensive sustainable addition standard care provide cancer patient hopefully lead larger-scale national study .</detailed_description>
