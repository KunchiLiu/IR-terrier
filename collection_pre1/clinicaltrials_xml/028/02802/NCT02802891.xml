	<detailed_description>Objectives : The JOIN project combine health indoor environment research area contribute development validation new asthma diagnosis method exhale VOC analysis . This method sensitive , specific , completely non-invasive . Moreover , JOIN project assess impact exposure indoor environment , namely endocrine disruptors , asthma allergy development child . The specific objective project : 1 . Classify child asthma healthy control use exhale VOC profile ; 2 . Classify asthma phenotype ( alergic v non-alergic asthma ) use exhaled VOCprofiles ; 3 . Evaluate influence ofprolonged exposure exogenous VOCs exhale breath sample ; 4 . Characterize indoor exposure measure concentration set chemical identify EDCs indoor air dust home ; 5 . Evaluate association exposure EDCs indoors child 's health outcome focus asthma/allergies also exacerbation allergy respiratory symptom already sensitize ; 6 . Investigate building material consumer product might contribute child 's exposure ; 7 . Assess association EDCs indoor exposure lung function , airway inflammation responsiveness , exhale urine biomarkers disease . The completion project may contribute validation new asthma diagnostic method way introduce real clinical context . The indoor air quality audit permit well understanding exposure process endocrine disruptors health effect , mainly child . The project also evaluate compare EDCs indoor air child , result exposure . Workplan : 1 . Selection recruitment study population In project , 75 child age 6 18 year old recruit ( legal guardian 's consent ) clinical visit immunoallergology department Hospital S. João . All participant inform aim procedure project ask sign inform consent form . Data collect confidential participant right data remove study time . Upon agreement legal guardian , visit participant ' home scheduled.During visit , EBC urine sample collect , well exhale breath ( non-condensed ) . 2 . Questionnaire survey A self-administered standardized questionnaire , base International study Asthma Allergies Childhood ( ISAAC ) , complete parents/legal guardian home , carry . Socio-demographic economic information , smoke drinking habit , use personal care product , family history disease dietary habit collect . A set question respiratory/allergic health child , current symptoms/diagnosis ( past 3 month ) also include . Simultaneously , feature indoor environment factor , type dwelling , age building , type flooring , ventilation , identify . 3 . Clinical assessment biological sample collection Children attend S. João Hospital Centre immunoallergology clinical evaluation invite participate study . Upon acceptance , data spirometry , fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) skin-prick-tests retrieve participant ' clinical file . Immediately clinical assessment , exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) collect child breathe 10 15 minute exhale air condense system ( portable TurboDECCS ) . The EBC sample store -80ºC laboratory analysis . During indoor air quality audit child home , additional EBC sample collect ( understand significant difference compare sample obtain hospital ) , well exhale air ( non-condensed ) . The exhaled air collect use 1 L Tedlar® bag ( SKC Inc. USA ) previously cleanse 3 nitrogen flush accord manufacturer instruction . The breathing bag serve solely store transport air already develop approve product . The participant ask ingest food flavour beverage 2h prior breath collection . Children instruct cleanse mouth water , inhale , hold breath 5 second subsequently exhale deeply Tedlar bag . Samples urine collect child two moment . The 1st moment day next clinical evaluation S. João Hospital Centre 2nd moment day indoor air quality audit.It previously give participant commercial polypropylene specimen collection container obtain 6-10 mL urine . Urine sample collect home early morning fasting period least 8 hoursto measure urinary EDCs ' metabolite , MBzP , MEP , MEHP . After collection urine sample store -20°C deliver day indoor air quality audit . Subsequently , sample freeze -20ºC analysis . 4 . Building inspection characterization A checklist use get information regard possible indoor source ( consumer cleaning product , furniture , type flooring ) , build characteristic ( e.g . age , ventilation , etc . ) , recent refurbish outdoor source , occupant 's behaviour information presence specific material consumer use also collect . 5 . Indoor air audit EDCs measure indoor air dust indoor air identify important source chemical exposure , house dust demonstrate important exposure pathway . Dust also provide record chemical use home historically since degradation process indoors typically slow . The chemical target analysis include phthalates , bisphenol A , ethanolamines glycol ether . These compound select base evidence endocrine disruption , asthma exacerbation , expect presence indoors consumer product , compatibility analytical method develop household exposure study . EDCs indoor air sample collect use URG personal pesticide sampling cartridge ( University Research Glassware ; chapel HilL , Nc ) , place child bedroom approximately breathe height . At end sample period , URG sampler store -4°c prior ship laboratory . To measure EDCs dust , household vacuum clean bag use . Dust sample collect surface bedroom floor also surface object , shelf , cupboard , doorframe , window frame , TV audio set , personal computer . Dust bag sieve 100µm metal screen store glass jar ( pre-cleaned hexane ) -20°C chemical analysis perform . Indoor air VOCs child bedroom collect active sampling , accord standardized procedure , time clinical assessment order evaluate influence pertinent ambient VOCs clinical test . The sampling perform use 5 L flow control pump ( SKC Inc. USA ) connect stainless steel sorption tube fill 200 mg Tenax TA 60/80 ( Supelco ) . The sample start time clinical assessment program end one hour , give representative sample indoor air VOCs time exhale breath collection . At end sampling , tube seal air-tight cap transport laboratory , store room temperature analysis . 6 . Laboratory analysis Volatile organic compound EDCs analyse SPME-GCxGC-ToF-MS chemistry department University Aveiro . There expense associate analysis human resource provide University Beira Interior Master student . The resultant chromatogram analyse quantified . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) perform create VOC profile discriminant profile establish accordance study group . Classification rate , area ROC curve , sensitivity specificity estimate different model . Furthermore , define discriminant profile , individual VOCs identify ( identifiable ) association asthma pathophysiology study .</detailed_description>
