	<brief_summary>The aim study induce peptide-specific immune response chronic lymphatic leukaemia ( CLL ) patient multi-peptide vaccination patient-individualized peptide cocktail , dependent minimal residual disease ( MRD ) status , immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient-individualized Peptide Vaccination Combination With Lenalidomide After First Line Therapy CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Duration Schedule : The duration trial subject expect 24 month . The duration individual patient include 6 month first-line therapy accord treat physician choice HLA ligandome analyse chronic lymphatic leukaemia cell selection patient-individual multi-peptide vaccine perform parallel , 12 month study treatment 6 month follow-up time . The overall duration trial expect approximately 4 year include preparatory phase . Recruitment subject start 06/2016 . The end study determine date last visit last patient ( Last Subject Out ( LSO ) 01/2020 ) . General Criteria Subject Selection : For screen procedure study , physically fit subject confirm diagnosis chronic lymphatic leukaemia ( CLL ) accord International Workshop chronic lymphatic leukaemia ( IWCLL ) guideline require treatment eligible . First line treatment perform accord treat physician choice . The trial population consist gender . Gender distribution trial suppose reflect distribution real patient 's population ( approximately 60 % male 40 % female patient ) , i.e . prior defined quantitative ratio female male . To assure included patient ability mount immune response , immune response Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) / Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) peptide mix assess screen phase . 60ml blood take prescreening study visit . Peripheral mononuclear cell isolate analysed 12 day IFNy ELiSPOT memory T cell response EBV/CMV peptide mix . Only patient show positive immune response include study . For study treatment , physically fit subject confirm diagnosis CLL accord IWCLL guideline , treat first line therapy accord physician choice . Subjects must achieve least partial remission ( IWCLL guideline diagnosis treatment CLL ) due treatment first line therapy . Study Design : Interventional , open·label , multi-center phase II trial use patient·individualized multipeptide vaccine imiquimod adjuvant without immunomodulator lenalidomide base MRD level individual patient . Blinding : No blinding perform avoid unnecessary complication intradermal injection sodium acid solution . Method bias patient selection : The patient selection document . Reasons refusal assessed.Method bias treatment manualized treatment protocol , monitor treatment report . Method bias data analysis : Monitoring , analysis intention treat ; independent statistician . Chronic lymphatic leukaemia-peptide vaccine ( CLL-VAC ) drug product ( DP ) : Each patient enrol individualized VAC-L-CLL trial receive CLL·VAC DP specifically tailor individual HLA ligandome Cll cell . The DPs compose peptide first manufacture drug substance . A process name CLL-VAC_v1 enables selection drug substance compose unique , patient-individual CLL·VAC DPs . CLL·VAC DPs compose base peptide warehouse consist 40 individual peptide ( drug substance ; 35 HLA class I peptides ( 5 A*01 , 5 A*02 , 5 A*03 , 5 A*24 , 5 B*07 , 5 B*08 , 5 B*44 ) 5 HLA class II peptide . 25 HLA class I peptides 5 HLA class II peptides show immunogenic therefore available vaccine cocktail composition ( 5 A*01 , 5 A*02 , 5 A*03 , 5 B*08 ) . For patient , 5 HLA class I peptides select warehouse base patient individual HLA ligandome analysis CLL cell subsequently formulate personalized drug ; 5 HLA class II peptide include 'peptide vaccine cocktail . All warehouse peptide manufacture BCN PEPTIDES , S.A , Eis Vinyets-Els Fogars 11,08777 Sant Quinti de Mediona ( Barcelona ) , Spain , Wirkstoffpeptidlabor , University Tubingen , Auf der Morgenstelle 15 , 72076 Tubingen , Germany . Both production sit hold certificate production good manufacture practice ( GMP ) grade synthetic peptide . All peptide synthetic peptide , manufacture well·established solid phase peptide synthesis ( SPPS ) procedures use Fmoc chemistry .</detailed_description>
