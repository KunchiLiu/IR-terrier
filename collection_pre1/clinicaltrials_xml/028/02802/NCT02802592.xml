	<brief_title>EPOgen Restrictive Transfusions Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery ( EPORT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study investigate use restrictive transfusion trigger administration single preoperative high dose shot epoetin alfa ( rhEPO ) young ( age &lt; 65 year age ) population undergo cardiac surgery . The investigator believe participant tolerate low Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) . Therefore , control group benefit restrictive transfusion trigger experimental group benefit EPO provide synergistic stimulus erythropoiesis . This propose study potential reduce overall transfusion utilization cardiac surgery improve standard care .</detailed_description>
