	<detailed_description>Objectives Endpoints Primary Objective : To establish one three study arm , R-CHOP/R-DHAP follow ASCT ( control arm A ) , R-CHOP+ibrutinib /R-DHAP follow ASCT ibrutinib maintenance experimental arm A+I ) , R-CHOP+ibrutinib /R-DHAP follow ibrutinib maintenance experimental arm I ) future standard base comparison investigator-assessed failure-free survival ( FFS ) . Secondary Objectives : - To compare efficacy three treatment arm term secondary efficacy endpoint - To determine safety tolerability ibrutinib induction immuno-chemotherapy maintenance compare safety profile three treatment arm term secondary toxicity endpoint Primary Endpoint : FFS define time start treatment stable disease end immuno-chemotherapy , progressive disease , death cause . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : - Overall survival ( OS ) - Progression-free survival ( PFS ) randomization , end induction immuno-chemotherapy patient CR PR end induction immuno-chemotherapy , stag 6 week end induction assessment ( month 6 ) - Overall response complete remission rate midterm , end induction , 3 month end induction immunochemotherapy ( month 6 ) - PR CR conversion rate follow-up end induction immuno-chemotherapy Secondary Toxicity Endpoints : - Rates AEs , SAEs , SUSARs CTC grade ( Version 4.03 ) induction immuno-chemotherapy period follow-up response immune-chemotherapy - Cumulative incidence rate SPMs Exploratory Objectives : - To compare feasibility ASCT arm A+I vs. arm A - To compare minimal residual disease status three treatment group - To determine impact ibrutinib induction immuno-chemotherapy maintenance therapy minimal residual disease status - To determine prognostic value minimal residual disease status - To determine prognostic value positron emission tomography fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose - To determine clinical biological prognostic predictive factor - To determine role total body irradiation ( TBI ) ASCT condition Exploratory Endpoints : - Rate successful stem cell mobilisation ( success : separation least 2x2x10 ( 6 ) CD34-positive cell , include back-up ) - Rate molecular remission ( MRD-negative patient ) midterm , end induction immuno-chemotherapy , stag time-points follow-up patient remission end induction immuno-chemotherapy - Time molecular remission start therapy - Time molecular relapse patient clinical molecular remission end induction immunochemotherapy - RD FDG-PET negative positive patient induction ASCT Exploratory objective may evaluate subset patient accord local standard resource .</detailed_description>
