	<brief_summary>Background : Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) cause cervical , throat , anal , genital cancer . Cancers cause HPV HPV protein call E7 inside cell . In new therapy , researcher take person blood , remove certain white blood cell , insert gene make target cancer cell E7 protein . The genetically change cell , call E7 TCR cell , give back person fight cancer . Researchers want see help people . Objective : To determine safe dose E7 TCR cell whether cell help patient . Eligibility : Adults age 18 66 HPV-16-associated cancer , include cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal , oropharyngeal . Design : Participants list medicine . Participants many screen test , include imaging procedure , heart lung test , lab test . They large catheter insert vein . Participants leukapheresis . Blood remove needle arm . A machine separate white blood cell . The rest blood return needle arm . The cell change lab . Participants stay hospital . Over several day , get : Chemotherapy drug E7 TCR cell Cell growth factor Shots injection stimulate blood cell Participants monitor hospital 12 day . They get support medicine blood lab test . Participants clinic visit 40 day cell infusion . They physical exam , blood work , scan , maybe x-ray . Participants many follow-up visit procedure . At visit , may undergo leukapheresis . Participants follow 15 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E7 TCR T Cells With Without PD-1 Blockade Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Metastatic refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -16+ cancer ( cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal , oropharyngeal cancer ) incurable poorly palliate standard therapy . - HPV-16+ cancer constitutively express HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein , absent healthy human tissue . - Administration T cell receptor ( TCR ) gene engineer T cell induce objective tumor response certain malignancy include HPV-16+ cancer . - T cell genetically engineer TCR target HPV-16 E7 ( E7 TCR ) display specific reactivity HLA-A2+ , HPV-16+ target cell . - Pembrolizumab monoclonal antibody block PD-1 , inhibitory receptor T cell , thereby prevent T cell inhibition . PD-1-blocking drug show clinical activity variety cancer . Objectives : Primary Objective - To determine safe dose E7 TCR cell plus aldesleukin without pembrolizumab treatment metastatic HPV-16+ cancer . Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year old less equal 66 year old metastatic refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer . - Prior first line systemic therapy require unless patient decline standard treatment . - Patients must HLA-A*02:01-positive . Design : - This phase I clinical trial test safety E7 TCR cell administer alone combination pembrolizumab . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow single infusion E7 TCR cell . Cell infusion follow high-dose aldesleukin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Measurable metastatic refractory/recurrent HPV16+ cancer ( determine situ hybridization ( ISH ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) base test ) . 2 . Patients must HLAA*02 low resolution typing , HLAA*02:01 one high resolution type result . 3 . All patient must receive prior first line standard therapy decline standard therapy . 4 . Patients three few brain metastasis treat surgery stereotactic radiosurgery eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable one month protocol treatment . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . 5 . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 66 year age . Prior clinical trial demonstrate safety condition regimen , cell therapy , highdose aldesleukin dose patient 66 year age . 6 . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document . 7 . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . 8 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month treatment . Patients must willing undergo test HPV16 prior become pregnant period . 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . Women childbearing potential defined woman except woman postmenopausal hysterectomy . Postmenopausal define woman age 55 menstrual period least one year . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother E7 TCR transduce PBL , breastfeed discontinue mother treated E7 TCR transduce PBL . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 10 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . a. Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm3 without support filgrastim . WBC great equal 3000/mm3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL b. Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Calculated creatinine clearance ( CCr ) great equal 50 mL/min/1.732 Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL c. More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past three week , long toxicity recover Grade 1 less . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Active systemic infection ( e.g . : require antiinfective treatment ) , coagulation disorder active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 2 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 3 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 4 . Patients autoimmune disease Crohn disease , ulcerative colitis , rheumatoid arthritis , autoimmune hepatitis pancreatitis , systemic lupus erythematosus . 5 . Concurrent systemic steroid therapy . 6 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction cyclophosphamide , fludarabine aldesleukin . 7 . History coronary revascularization ischemic symptom . 8 . Documented LVEF less equal 45 % test . The following patient undergo cardiac evaluation 1 . Clinically significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmia include limited : atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia , second third degree heart block 2 . Age great equal 60 year old</criteria>
