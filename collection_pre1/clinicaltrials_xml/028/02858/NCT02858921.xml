	<detailed_description>The new drug option advance melanoma include oncogene-targeted therapy ( dabrafenib , trametinib vemurafenib ) immune checkpoint blockade ( pembrolizumab , nivolumab ipilimumab ) . These drug show remarkable efficacy regulatory approval metastatic disease . However , patient advance disease eventually progress . It unknown earlier treatment systemic therapy surgery improve long term survival optimal sequence combination therapy . An efficient method assess drug combination human critical , particularly combination molecularly target and/or immune therapy may similar signal efficacy pre-clinical model , recapitulation human immune system animal model limit . Neoadjuvant clinical trial patient resectable bulky stage III/IV melanoma allow rapid evaluation drug activity human utilising multiple clinical endpoint ( metabolic response Positron Emission Tomography [ PET ] , clinical response Computed Tomography [ CT ] imaging , pathological response , relapse-free survival overall survival ) translational endpoint ( morphological , genetic immunophenotyping tumour blood ) . Surgery remain standard care resectable Stage III IV melanoma , despite recent drug therapy advance describe . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently expand approve use ipilimumab include new use adjuvant therapy patient resectable stage III / IV melanoma , low risk relapse follow surgery . Neoadjuvant therapy group patient may also result improved survival rate duration local distant disease control , reduce surgical morbidity potential early elimination microscopic metastatic disease . There emerge rapidly grow evidence base value combine targeted immunotherapy number histological subtypes cancer . The support potential synergy two treatment modality establish , increase toxicity profile . Both single agent BRAF inhibitor combine BRAF MEK inhibitor induce mark clonal T cell infiltrate respond melanoma metastasis early treatment ( day 7-15 ) , transient , present progression . Concurrently , melanoma tumour antigen program death-ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) expression increase early treatment . It unknown whether potential convert subset patient fail either immunotherapy target therapy alone long-term responder treat program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) inhibitor conjunction mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) target therapy . Furthermore , unclear whether PD-1 inhibitor would best combine sequentially concurrently MAPK inhibitor . Mouse model provide clear rational combining treatment upfront , however human tissue evidence guide best combination strategy . The question best maximize clinical outcome via concurrent versus sequential target immune therapy may explore efficiently human neoadjuvant setting , detailed interrogation multiple biopsy early treatment . Immunological , proteomic genetic feature tissue blood provide vivo assessment tumour responsiveness therapy . This may enable selective application therapeutic agent patient likely benefit . Such finding would improve therapeutic index cost effectiveness agent . Earlier systemic therapy prior surgery also mean earlier target distant micrometastases could become source future disease relapse . The rationale study design therefore base hypothesis two week target therapy may sufficient induce enhanced tumoral immunity result high pathological clinical response use 'Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ' ( RECIST ) guideline follow sequentially pembrolizumab , either pembrolizumab alone combination target therapy pembrolizumab upfront . The potential toxicity could affect adherence combine study treatment recognise , additive , overlap unforeseen adverse event may occur triple combination . The adverse event profile safety-related interruption treatment therefore assessed conjunction objective response . The clinical translational finding study potential inform rational decision regard combination treatment metastatic adjuvant setting . This critical study inform future practice future phase 3 clinical trial . The translational research perform tissue biopsy blood provide mechanistic information guide selection optimal combination therapy phase 3 study advance adjuvant setting . This phase II , randomise , open label , three arm , parallel group , clinical trial neoadjuvant combine target immune therapy patient BRAF V600 mutant resectable stage III ( bulky regional stage IIIB-C ) resectable stage IV ( M1a ) melanoma . This translational study explore pathological RECIST response rate 12-week duration neoadjuvant therapy across 3 treatment arm . The key secondary outcome measure include detailed analysis immunologic , proteomic genetic biomarkers tumour tissue peripheral blood week 1 , 4 12 compare baseline correlate clinical , metabolic pathological response neoadjuvant treatment , relapse overall survival adjuvant treatment . In patient relapse within 40 week adjuvant treatment , analysis tumour tissue ( possible ) undertaken . Relapse free overall survival , surgical outcome adverse event profile also determine . Sixty patient randomise one three treatment group 1:1:1 ratio , 20 patient treatment arm : - `` Sequential immunotherapy '' : Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice day + Trametinib 2mg orally day 2 week , follow treatment Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg deliver intravenously week 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , every 3 week week 12 50 week . - `` Concurrent immunotherapy '' : Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice day + Trametinib 2mg orally day + Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously every 3 week 52 week . - `` Immunotherapy alone '' : Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously every 3 week alone 52 week . Allocation treatment conceal prior randomisation perform via web base system permute block stratify BRAF V600E mutation versus non BRAF V600E mutation ( i.e . V600D , V600K , V600R , V600M ) . Neoadjuvant treatment three arm administer 12 week , follow complete resection tumour evidence disease . Surgery follow 40 week adjuvant therapy disease relapse , death , intolerable adverse drug reaction withdrawal patient consent . After 52 week study treatment phase , patient follow 3 monthly relapse ( progression , follow relapse ) survival 5 year . The biomarker component study require blood sample core biopsy tumour tissue follow time point : - Baseline ( PRE ) - Week 1 ( EDT 1 ) - Week 4 ( EDT 4 ) - Week 12 - complete lymph node/metastasectomy dissection specimen ( POST ) - At Relapse ( RELAPSE ) applicable available Surveillance disease 12 week neoadjuvant period undertaken 4 weekly surgical assessment ultrasound affect lymph node basin / metastatic region . CT chest , abdomen pelvis , area know suspected disease ( e.g . extremity , neck ) perform week six , PET whole body . All examination compare baseline investigation .</detailed_description>
