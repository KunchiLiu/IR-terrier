	<brief_summary>This pilot trial study side effect give pembrolizumab together stereotactic radiosurgery treat patient melanoma non-small cell lung cancer spread brain . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Stereotactic radiosurgery specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may cause less damage normal tissue . Giving pembrolizumab together stereotactic radiosurgery may better treatment patient melanoma non-small cell lung cancer spread brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Stereotactic Radiosurgery Melanoma Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety three different stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) radiation arm combination pembrolizumab melanoma non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) brain metastasis ( BM ) patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate intracranial outcome - control treated lesion brain SRS+ pembrolizumab ( i.e . local control ) , development additional site disease brain initially treat SRS ( i.e . anywhere intra-cranial failure ) , intra-cranial progression free survival ( local control area receive SRS anywhere intra-cranial failure ) , extra-cranial disease response ( overall progression free survival ) , rate leptomeningeal dissemination , overall survival . II . To determine overall response rate overall survival combination SRS pembrolizumab compare SRS alone ( historical control ) . III . To determine overall response rate overall survival combination SRS pembrolizumab compare pembrolizumab alone ( historical control ) . IV . To evaluate treatment response un-irradiated extra-cranial site ( i.e . abscopal effect ) three arm . V. To compare difference potential immune biomarkers , pretreatment , treatment , post treatment . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 arm . ARM A ( SRS 6 Gy ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week ( Q3W ) least 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo 5 SRS fraction day 2-15 course 1 . ARM B ( SRS 9 Gy ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV Arm A . Patients undergo 3 SRS fraction day 2-15 course 1 . ARM C ( SRS 18-21 Gy ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV Arm A . Patients undergo 1 SRS fraction day 2-3 course 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week physician 's discretion radiologic image monitor disease .</detailed_description>
