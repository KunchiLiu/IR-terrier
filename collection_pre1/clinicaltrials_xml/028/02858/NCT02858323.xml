	<brief_summary>Background : Platelets blood cell help blood clot . Some people call thrombocytopenia . This mean low blood platelet count . They need platelet transfusion often . Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) alloimmunization occur lot people . They become refractory . This mean platelet level longer increase transfusion . Researchers want study procedure detect HLA antibody . They want test well predict person respond transfusion . They want see good procedure usually use . Objective : To study effect C1q-binding Class I HLA antibody platelet refractoriness people get platelet transfusion . To test method well predicts response platelet transfusion IgG solid phase immunoassay method . Eligibility : People enrol protocols 11-C-0136 , 08-H-0156 , 03-C-0277 , 01-C-0157 , 01-C-0129 : Agreed specimen data use future research Had Class I HLA antibody detect IgG method Had one platelet transfusion NIH first positive HLA IgG antibody result Design : For participant , researcher look small portion archive plasma sample . The sample leave prior HLA antibody test . Participants sample analyze . They test see C1q-binding HLA antibody present . This do solid phase immunoassay . Results compare past result IgG method . Participants data store database protect password .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) alloimmunization common patient undergoing frequent platelet transfusion , important cause immune platelet refractoriness . Management strategy HLA alloimmune platelet-refractory patient include transfusion HLA-matched crossmatched platelet ; however , broadly-sensitized patient , patient uncommon HLA type , antigen-negative epitope compatible donor may difficult find . The Luminex immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G single-antigen-bead ( SAB ) solid phase immunoassay commonly use detect HLA antibody . However , assay specifically detects C1qbinding HLA antibody report identify clinically relevant subset HLA antibodies solid organ transplantation ; one group study utility assay platelet transfusion HLA-alloimmunized platelet refractory patient . We intend evaluate ability C1-binding immunoassay predict response platelet transfusion HLA alloimmune patient .</detailed_description>
