	<brief_summary>This small pilot study compare High Flow Nasal Cannula ( HFNC ) therapy oxygen nasal cannula therapy infant obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) schedule clinically order sleep study call polysomnography ( PSG ) . The HFNC procedure use humidified room air deliver nasal cannula high pressure test HFNC control OSA infant well well low flow nasal oxygen , current clinical standard care . All infant study brief test period 3 4 hour HFNC participant begin standard clinical PSG titration oxygen nasal cannula treatment OSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current standard care treat OSA infant less 6 month frequently 12 month age continuous flow oxygen nasal cannula . This generally refer nasal continuous positive airway pressure NCPAP . A nasal cannula use oxygen low flow 1/4 1 liter per minute ( l/m ) deliver supplemental oxygen reduce oxygen desaturations associate apneic episode provide positive pressure flow maintain open airway . High Flow Nasal Cannula ( HFNC ) therapy non-invasive treatment provide respiratory support . In study , HFNC design administer heat humidified mixture air flow higher patient 's inspiratory flow . There currently single , simple definition high flow . In infant , usually refers flow &gt; 2 l/min child consider &gt; 6 l/min . High flow present several advantage conventional 'low-flow ' oxygen therapy term humidification , oxygenation , gas exchange , breathe pattern . Several study show flow higher patient 's inspiratory flow provide well oxygen delivery low-flow oxygen therapy high-concentration oxygenation mask . This observation explain effect high flow oropharyngeal dead space , wash oxygen deplete gas reduce carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) rebreathing . The extrathoracic dead space proportionally two three time great child adult . It may measure 3 mL/kg newborn become similar adult volume 6 year age ( 0.8 mL/kg ) . Consequently , young child , great effect high flow oxygenation CO2 clearance . This pilot study compare standard care low flow nasal oxygen effectiveness HFNC therapy infant age 12 month young treat OSA . The study intervention occur approximately 3 4 hour immediately prior schedule clinical PSG . Subjects prepared standard clinical PSG asleep , intervention titration room air different pressure flow deliver HFNC system . At end research portion PSG , clinical PSG begin standard care treatment , nasal oxygen titration OSA . The result clinical PSG serve control comparison research intervention .</detailed_description>
