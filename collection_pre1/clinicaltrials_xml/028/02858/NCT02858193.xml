	<brief_title>Single Dose , Two-stage Bioequivalence Study SCMC-Lys Salt 1.35 g Powder vs SCMC-Lys Salt 90 mg/mL Syrup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A. extension line program , Dompé develop new 1.35 g powder oral solution formulation carbocysteine L-lysine salt-monohydrate . The present bioequivalence phase I study need compare bioavailability concentration-time profile new 1.35 g powder oral solution formulation reference compound Fluifort® 90 mg/mL syrup ( 15 mL correspond 1.35 g SCMC- lys ) . The new 1.35 g powder oral solution formulation carbocysteine L-lysine salt- monohydrate expect bioequivalent Fluifort® 90 mg/mL syrup indication : mucolytic , expectorant acute chronic respiratory tract disorder . Primary end-point evaluate bioequivalent rate ( Cmax ) extent ( AUC0-t ) absorption carbocysteine single oral administration test reference . Secondary end-point : 1 . To describe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile carbocysteine single oral administration test reference ; 2. collect safety tolerability data single oral administration test reference . Study Design : The trial design agreement `` Guideline investigation bioequivalence . '' Due lack information PK profile new formulation decide use `` two stage '' bioequivalence study design , allow re-calculation sample size case number subject initially enrol study large enough provide reliable answer question address due underestimation variability mislead estimation point estimate T/R ratio geometric mean . The sample size stage 1 calculate assume point estimate T/R ratio geometric mean 1.053 ( i.e . μR=0.95·μT ) multiplicative coefficient variation ( CVm ) 20 % AUC0-t Cmax . A power 90 % consider , accord Pocock spending function current European bioequivalence guideline , α level set 0.0294 . Fifteen ( 15 ) subject per sequence ( i.e . 30 subject overall ) enrol first stage study . After end study stage 1 , PK parameter calculate ad interim bioequivalence test perform calculated PK parameter Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ . To safeguard overall type I error , α level bioequivalence test set 0.0294 accord Pocock spending function . Should bioequivalence proven result subject first stage , primary objective study would satisfy second study stage take place . Should bioequivalence proven result subject first stage posteriori calculate power &gt; 90 % AUC0-t Cmax , study stop bioequivalence proven . Should bioequivalence proven result subject first stage posteriori calculate power ≤ 90 % AUC0-t Cmax , overall sample size study ( stage 1 plus 2 ) calculate basis ad interim bioequivalence result . The additional subject enrol second study stage . After completion stage 2 , PK analysis bioequivalence test perform pooled subject two study stage . The α level bioequivalence test stage 1 plus 2 set 0.0294 accord Pocock spending function . The second stage perform notification sample size local Ethics Committee central Swiss authority ( Swissmedic ) .</detailed_description>
