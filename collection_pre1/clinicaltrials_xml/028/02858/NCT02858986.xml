	<brief_summary>Introduction : Three-dimensional key-hole surgery ( 'laparoscopic ' ) system prove reduce time required complete task laboratory setting . This benefit derive addition binocular depth perception cue compare two-dimensional ( 2D ) system . This year '4K ' laparoscopic system become commercially available , so-named provide high resolution 2D image four time number pixel 2D full high definition . The improved visualisation likely provide additional non-binocular depth cue . It currently unclear degree improve resolution 2D system compensate binocular depth cue . Aim : To determine whether binocular vision provide 3D laparoscopic system provide benefit simulate task compare monocular vision provide high-resolution 4K system . Methods : Two experiment perform : 1 ) A laboratory assessment 3D versus 4K laparoscopic system industry optical standard , 2 ) A study assess benefit novice expert surgeon use 3D 4K laparoscopic system laparoscopic simulator task . The primary outcome measure number error laparoscopic simulator task . The secondary outcome measure include : objective subjective measure picture quality , task completion time , side effect ( eye discomfort ) cognitive workload laparoscopic simulator tasks Impact : This study unique , first-of-its-kind investigation two new surgical technology , first study involve 4K system . The uptake three-dimensional system curb financial cost limitation early 3D technology . This study aim determine system may safest , quick cost- effective , order guide future investment technological development towards either 3D 2D system . In addition , system may also aid learn curve trainee surgeon .</brief_summary>
