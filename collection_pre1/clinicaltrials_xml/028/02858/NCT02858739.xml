	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION The RUDI FREE REGISTRY polymer-free DES ( BIOFREEDOM ) coronary artery disease investigator-initiated , prospective , multicenter registry all-comers patient indication percutaneous coronary intervention . This Registry enroll 1000 patient approximately 10 site throughout Italian territory BIOFREEDOM regulatory approval commercially available . 2 . BACKGROUND INFORMATION 2.1 Coronary device evolution In 1977 Andreas Grüntzig perform first balloon coronary angioplasty , revolutionary treatment lead birth new specialty , `` interventional cardiology '' . Since pioneer procedure , extensive development advance culminate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) one frequently perform invasive medical procedure clinical practice today . Coronary stenting become widely implement publication landmark BENESTENT trial STRESS evidence indicate stenting safe absence anticoagulation therapy use dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) and/or adequate stent deployment order avoid stent thrombosis phenomenon . By 1999 , coronary stenting perform 84.2 % PCI procedures ; however , despite obvious advantage , associate problem concern . Most notably addition risk thrombosis , iatrogenic problem emerge form in-stent neointimal hyperplasia . The dramatic reduction restenosis rate , see use DES compare BMS , major drive force behind exponential growth PCI treatment patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Even drug-eluting permanent metallic stent , however , short long-term limitation : still unclear duration dual antiplatelet therapy strongly link risk stent thrombosis , although infrequent , ominous event poor prognosis . Durable polymer first-generation DES , trigger hypersensitivity reaction chronic inflammation vessel layer , may indeed promote stent thrombosis . Therefore , order overcome late undesirable effect reduce arterial wall toxicity , new DES platform biocompatible durable polymer , biodegradable polymer polymer-free develop . 2.2 BIOFREEDOM technology The Biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom drug-coated stent ( DCS ) consist stainless steel stent platform textured abluminal surface onto BA9 solvent apply . The drug-coated stent crimp onto delivery system include high pressure , semi-compliant balloon incorporate onto distal tip rapid exchange delivery catheter system . The delivery system two radiopaque marker inside balloon , fluoroscopically mark end stent facilitate proper stent placement . For trial , BioFreedom DCS available 6 nominal stent diameter ( 2.25-4.0 mm ) , seven length ( 8-28 mm ) , dose Biolimus A9 15.6 μg/mm stent length . After implantation , stent thus release anti-proliferative agent directly vessel wall , without use polymer coating , thereby eliminate polymer associate tissue response . BA9 extremely lipophilic , take vessel wall , process 98 % complete 4 week animal model , stent becomes BMS . In pig model 28 180 day , BioFreedom stent associate inflammation score significantly low Cypher sirolimus elute polymer-coated stent , similar observe BMS . It therefore reasonable hypothesize DCS may safety advantage , less dependence prolong DAPT polymer-associated DES . The anti-proliferative efficacy device assess BioFreedom first-in-man trial . Two different BA9 dose BioFreedom stent compare Taxus Liberté stent 182 low-risk patient , 92 % underwent control angiography 4 12 month . DAPT recommend least 6 month patient . The primary endpoint non-inferiority comparison BioFreedom standard dose Taxus mean in-stent late lumen loss 12 month ( P = .001 ) . In addition , median in-stent late loss compare among three group study , result value 0.17 mm standard dose ( 15.6 μg/mm ) , 0.22 mm low dose ( 7.8 μg/mm ) , 0.35 mm Taxus stent ( standard dose v Taxus : superiority P = .11 ) . At 2 year clinically-driven target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) 3.4 % standard dose BioFreedom , 9.9 % low dose 5.0 % Taxus ( n ) . There ST patient 2 year . Based result , standard dose device select clinical evaluation . Recently publish rationale design LEADERS FREE trial : A randomized double-blind comparison BioFreedom drug-coated stent v Gazelle bare metal stent patient high bleed risk use short ( 1 month ) course dual antiplatelet therapy . A total 2456 patient consider high risk bleed randomize double-blind fashion BioFreedom drug-coated stent control arm ( Gazelle bare metal stent ) . Both group treat DAPT 1 month , follow long-term aspirin alone . At 1-year follow-up , primary safety endpoint ( composite cardiac death , myocardial infarction stent thrombosis ) assess non-inferiority analysis , primary efficacy endpoint ( clinically drive target lesion revascularization ) superiority analysis . This trial help well characterize neglected subset PCI patient quantify thrombotic bleeding risk . 2.2 STUDY DEVICE The device use registry Biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom stent ( DCS ) System manufacture Biosensors . The Biofreedom stent refers system consist drug-coated stent crimp onto delivery system ( see IFU detail concern indication use , contraindication , system preparation , precaution , warning ) . 3 REGISTRY OBJECTIVE The aim present registry investigate procedural well long-term clinical result term safety efficacy polymer-free DES technology comer patient indication percutaneous coronary intervention . 4 REGISTRY FLOW AND CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE The RUDI FREE REGISTRY prospective multi-center national registry evaluate safety efficacy terns procedural clinical outcome BIOFREEDOM stent daily use comer patient indication PCI .
