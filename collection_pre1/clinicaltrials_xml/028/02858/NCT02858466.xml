	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain medical condition involve allodynia ( painful perception response stimuli normally ) spontaneous pain ( occur rest , without stimulation ) . This pain secondary nervous system injury affect sensory system . The lesion either nerve ending spinal cord brain . It induce loss sensitivity likely reorganization brain activity cause pain subject study . Previous study functional neuroimaging focus brain area activate allodynic stimulus compare non-painful stimulus . The abnormality report , possible conclude formally . The author fail assess part effect loss sensory afferent ( deafferentation ) basal brain function . Indeed , operation without sensory stimulation know yet initial level activity benchmark study brain function stimulation . The objective study understand cortical system allodynic dysfunctional patient compare control baseline .</brief_summary>
