	<brief_summary>Single center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial use PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) A/P chemoprophylaxis immunization PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) repeat CHMI . A total 30 adult , healthy , malaria naïve volunteer receive three injection Direct Venous Inoculation ( DVI ) either placebo ( n = 10 ) , 51,200 PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) ( n = 10 ) , 150,000 PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) ( n = 10 ) chemoprophylaxis A/P 4 week interval . The placebo NaCl 0.9 % . Ten week last dose PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) immunization , volunteer undergo first CHMI follow asexual blood stage parasitemia , detect quantitative real time PCR ( qPCR ) thick blood smear microscopy . If parasitemic , treated A/P ( use case standard treatment regimen ) . In event parasitemia , volunteer follow Day 28 post-CHMI receive A/P . Forty-four week last immunization , second CHMI administer assess longevity protection . All volunteer follow 28 day post-inoculation . Those develop parasitemia treat A/P .</brief_summary>
