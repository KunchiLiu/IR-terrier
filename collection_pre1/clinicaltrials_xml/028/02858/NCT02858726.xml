	<brief_summary>2 Part Study : Part A assess 3 different dosing level IV CR845 versus placebo patient hemodialysis moderate-to-severe itching due uremic pruritus . Patients receive either CR845 placebo dialysis session eight week . The safety efficacy CR845 monitor throughout study . A sub-group patient also pharmacokinetic assessment complete . Part B study ass one dose IVCR845 versus placebo 12 week patient hemodialysis moderate-to-severe itching . The dose CR845 use Part B base safety efficacy find Part A .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate IV CR845 Hemodialysis Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Pruritus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part study . Patients participate Part A consent trained completion questionnaire severity itch overall health . Patients require complete questionnaire visit dialysis center also home day . Results screen questionnaire assess eligibility study . Additional laboratory test measurement safety also complete screening period . Patients meet criterion entry Part A study randomize receive either one three different dos CR845 placebo . Patients receive study drug eight week IV hemodialysis treatment ( i.e . 3 time per week ) . Assessments intensity itch safety also complete 8 week treatment period . When patient complete treatment , Follow-up visit complete 7 day later . Patients participate Part B consent trained completion questionnaire itch overall health . Patients require complete questionnaire visit dialysis center also home day . Laboratory test measurement safety also complete screening period determine study eligibility . Patients meet criterion entry Part B study randomize receive either CR845 placebo . The dose CR845 use determine base safety efficacy Part A . Patients dose either CR845 placebo twelve week hemodialysis treatment ( i.e . 3 time per week ) . Assessments intensity itch safety complete treatment period also . When patient complete treatment , Follow-up visit complete 7 day later .</detailed_description>
