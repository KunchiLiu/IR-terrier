Study type : Single-blind block randomize control trial . Sampling : Patients sample dermatology out-patient clinic Odense University Hospital . Eligibility criterion : Psoriasis patient age 18-75 year mild-moderate psoriasis . It mandatory patient smartphone basic skill use smartphone . Estimated sample size : To able improve medical adherence , investigator wish detect 8 % difference number application intervention control arm use Enstilar© 4 week treatment period . Confidence Interval ( two-sided ) use 95 % C.I. , power 80 , ratio sample size 1 , mean number application intervention Group 90 % recommend daily application / 4 week , S.D . 15 % , drop-outs maximum 10 % : Total sample size : 128 participant All participant see trial principal investigator study visit . Disclosure inform signed consent obtain inclusion : The patient aware test new equipment , inform monitor purpose study . Randomization : Single-blind block randomize control trial . Procedure : At first study visit trial investigator obtain information regard gender , age estimate use Enstilar© 4 week base involve Body Surface Area ( BSA ) . For randomization investigator use block base 1 ) age 2 ) gender . Procedures baseline study visit : While patient fill Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) questionnaire , trial investigator insert baseline data programme REsearch Data Capture ( REDCap© ) randomize , randomize intervention- control arm . Both intervention- control group receive Enstilar© consultation . To avoid attrition bias prescribe doctor , knowledge regard patient randomize intervention restrict one nurse last study visit . After consultation patient refer nearby room , nurse access see group participant randomize . If participant randomize app group , nurse instruct patient download app smartphone give standard care instruction regard adhere treatment plan . The participant control group reveive standard care instruction nurse regard adhere treatment plan . The nurse disclose patient monitor .

At study visit week 4 patient return EM investigator . Conclusion : If app smartphones EM improve adherence significantly improve secondary outcome measure long-term ( week 26 ) , promise potential implement app clinic .
