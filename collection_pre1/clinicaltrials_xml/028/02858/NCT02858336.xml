	<brief_summary>Background : Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea ( functional HA ) condition woman period stop temporary time . This due improper function hypothalamus . This part brain direct whole reproductive system . Researchers want learn functional HA . They also want learn diet , exercise , factor may change woman menstrual cycle . Objective : To good understand functional HA . Eligibility : Healthy woman age 18 28 year old : Have regular period Exercise 4 hour week Had first period age 11 14 Design : Participants prescreened phone . Participants screen : Blood urine test Medical history Physical exam . Participants 9 10 visit 3 menstrual cycle . These include : Repeat screening test Questionnaires Exercise test Resting energy expenditure test : Participants fast overnight test . They lie back canopy half hour . Body composition test : This do dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . Pelvic ultrasound For two full-day visit , IV insert arm vein . The IV take blood sample every 10 minute 8 hour . Participants keep log : Menstrual cycle log Diet log three 4-day cycle Participants receive test kit complete home : Daily blood urine sample Ovulation Participants take daily iron supplement . They wear wristband monitor activity 24 hour day . Participants stick special diet two 5-day period time . They complete two 4-day exercise program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea ( HA ) reversible form hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( HH ) trigger stressor exercise , nutritional deficit , psychological stress . Dysfunction hypothalamic component reproductive axis play key role functional HA manifest alter pattern luteinizing hormone ( LH ) pulse detectable peripheral blood . There ample evidence support use LH surrogate marker hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) secretion hypothalamus . There also significant evidence woman vary susceptibility stress-induced amenorrhea , point role environmental genetic factor etiology functional HA . However , variation change GnRH pulse frequency response stressor healthy woman define . Data previous work lab suggest rare variant gene associate form HH may also contribute variability see susceptibility functional HA . The long-term goal research examine interaction environment gene HA . In pilot study propose examine inter-individual variability pulsatile LH secretion response standardize neutral deficient energy availability ( NEA DEA , respectively ) normal woman . We relate primary end-point propose predictive factor include past reproductive family history marker current metabolic status response energy availability . Our initial analysis help determine simplified biomarkers translate large study examine potential combined effect energy availability genotype . The propose pilot study single-site , 2-period study healthy female volunteer . The study enroll approximately 50 participant 9 month target study completion 25 subject . Eligible participant female great equal 18 year age . Eligible participant menarche 14 year age earlier age 11 . Eligible participant gynecological age ( year menarche ) 14 year less . The upper age limit vary base subject age menarche fall 25 28 among participant . Eligible participant confirm pre-screening call normal menstrual cycle ( self-reported ) least previous 2 month ovulation confirm menstrual cycle start intervention . The primary outcome change daytime LH pulse frequency , compare NEA v DEA . Secondary measure evaluate past reproductive history , family history , current metabolic status use medical history interview lifestyle questionnaire maximum oxygen uptake ( measure fitness ) . Resting energy expenditure , body composition metabolic stress hormone measure baseline association intervention . Blood sample collect eventual genotyping .</detailed_description>
