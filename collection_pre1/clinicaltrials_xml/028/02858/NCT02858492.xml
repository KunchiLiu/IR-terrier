	<brief_summary>This study first study GSK2982772 , receptor-interacting protein-1 ( RIP1 ) kinase inhibitor , subject moderate severe RA currently treat disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) . The primary objective study investigate safety tolerability repeat oral dos GSK2982772 subject moderate severe RA . In addition PK , number experimental clinical endpoint employ obtain information PD , preliminary efficacy subject active RA . Although formal hypothesis test , endpoint enable broad understand mechanism action potential clinical efficacy GSK2982772 RA . After screen period 30 day , approximately 30 subject randomize receive either GSK2982772 placebo 84 day ( 12 week ) , follow follow-up period ( 28 day ) . The total duration participation study approximately 20 week screen last study visit .</brief_summary>
