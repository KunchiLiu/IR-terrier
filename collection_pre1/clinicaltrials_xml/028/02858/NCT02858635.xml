	<brief_summary>Suicide major health problem cause annually million death worldwide . In stress-vulnerability model , suicidal behavior ( SB ) result interaction individual 's predisposition stressful condition . According model , individual carry suicidal act subject stress factor ( environmental stress , depression , substance ... ) specific vulnerability.These vulnerability consider clinical parameter ( propensity despair , aggressive and/or impulsive trait ) , neurobiological parameter ( dysfunction serotonergic system , ... ) cognitive parameter ( take disadvantageous decision ... ) . Suicidal vulnerability partly underpinned genetic factor . The interest current research identify biomarkers improve opportunity early identification subject risk SB . The four goal project continuity previous work team : 1 . To determine whether combination main serotonin-related gene may better contribute vulnerability SB , consider independently . 2 . To assess whether association gene SB modulate childhood trauma , life event stress response associate environmental factor . 3 . To test value combine clinical , neuropsychological genetic factor suicide prevention , prospective study , particularity impulsivity gene gene interaction . 4 . To investigate association event real life ( use ecological momentary assessment ) emotional response suicidal ideation . The investigator propose use multidisciplinary approach answer question , hence , able identify new prevention strategy SB .</brief_summary>

The first objective study replicate result already obtain regard association serotonergic system gene suicidal behaviour . The allele frequency different marker test suicidal control subject history suicidal behaviour compare . The patient recruit compare control population already recruit another project . Prospective study : 554 patient hospitalize suicide attempt evaluate , 6 month , 2-years period study . Clinical , biological neuropsychological assessment perform . At end inclusion visit , 60 participant assess use ecological momentary assessment ( ESM ) .
