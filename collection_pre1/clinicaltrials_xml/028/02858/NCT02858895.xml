	<brief_title>Convection-Enhanced Delivery ( CED ) MDNA55 Adults With Glioblastoma First Recurrence Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug , MDNA55 , fusion protein comprise genetically engineer Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) link modified version Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A ( PE ) . MDNA55 bind IL-4 receptor ( IL4R ) , over-expressed cancer cell non-malignant immunosuppressive cell tumor microenvironment ( TME ) , delivers potent cell-killing agent , PE . The target , IL4R , ideal under-exploited target development cancer therapeutic , frequently intensely express wide variety human carcinoma . Expression level IL4R low surface healthy normal cell , increase several-fold cancer cell . A majority cancer biopsy autopsy sample adult pediatric brain tumor , include recurrent glioblastoma biopsy , show over-express IL4R . Cells express IL4R biomarker bind MDNA55 , therefore , subject PE-mediated effect . This single-arm , open-label , multicenter study approximately 43 adult primary ( de novo ) Glioblastoma recur progressed failure standard first-line therapy ( accord RANO criterion ) . The study conduct 10 clinical site follow institutional review board approval complete informed consent . Subjects meet study eligibility criterion undergo surgery associate study drug administration . MDNA55 administer locally convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) . Post-treatment follow-up assessment safety perform 14 day CED infusion . Thereafter , efficacy safety assessment perform 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 270 , 360 day CED infusion . Subjects discontinue Day 360 visit undergo procedure schedule Day 360 visit time discontinuation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . ≥ 18 year old , access archival tissue first diagnosis Glioblastoma life expectancy ≥ 12 week 2 . Histologically proven , primary ( de novo ) Glioblastoma recur progress 1 standard treatment regimen include surgery radiotherapy without chemotherapy ( accord local practice ; Stupp protocol , Stupp et al. , 2005 ) 3 . Subjects must evidence first tumor recurrence/progression determine standard RANO criterion : 1 . Includes primary Glioblastoma 2 . Screening MRI must perform within 14 day prior enrollment , subject receive steroid must stable , decrease dose least 5 day prior image 3 . More 12 week must elapse since completion radiation therapy time study entry 4 . Recurrent tumor must solid , supratentorial , contrastenhancing Glioblastoma small 1 cm large 4 cm diameter assess Imaging Core Laboratory base MRI take within 14 day prior catheter placement 5 . If temozolomide receive part first line therapy , subject must recover toxic effect temozolomide least 23 day last dose prior start CED infusion 6 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 7 . Women childbearing potential must negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test document within 14 day prior treatment 8 . Women men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ; hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence , etc . duration study participation 6 month post drug administration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately 9 . Requirements organ marrow function follow : adequate bone marrow function : leukocytes &gt; 2,000/μL ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/μL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/μL adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ; aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN adequate renal function : creatinine exceed 1.5 × institutional ULN creatinine clearance : ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional ULN lymphocytes &gt; 500/μL adequate coagulation function : international normalized ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.4 ; partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ institutional ULN , unless receive therapeutic low molecular weight heparin 10 . Able read , understand , sign inform consent document undergo studyspecific procedure legal representative willing ; subject must register prior treatment study drug 11 . Subjects must able willing undergo multiple brain MRI examinations 12 . Subjects must able willing comply study procedures 1 . Any prior therapy Glioblastoma consider standard care primary Glioblastoma , include limited following : one line adjuvant temozolomide ; temozolomide treatment must complete least 23 day prior CED infusion prior treatment another investigational drug prior treatment bevacizumab ( Avastin ) vascularendothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor VEGFreceptor signal inhibitor prior treatment nitrosoureas prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy Gliadel® Wafers ( carmustine implant ) 2 . Secondary Glioblastoma ( i.e. , Glioblastoma progress lowgrade diffuse astrocytoma AA ) 3 . Unable provide archival tissue first diagnosis Glioblastoma 4 . Tumor brain stem ( include fluidattenuated inversion recovery [ FLAIR ] change ) , infratentorial tumor , multifocal satellite tumor 5 . Tumor clinically significant mass effect ( &gt; 5 mm midline shift ) stable corticosteroid dose 6 . Subjects tumor completely liquefy ( &gt; 95 % cyst ) convection would possible 7 . Tumor geometric feature make difficult adequately cover tumor volume infusate use CED catheter ; tumor include follow : tumor appear wrap around ventricular structure , catheter tip may position &gt; 1.0 cm ventricle large angle ( `` elbow '' `` L shape '' ) tumor shape present convection likely compromise tumor postsurgical enhancement T1 image margin around resection cavity may confuse recur tumor ; subject enhancement exceed 1 cm thickness exclude 8 . Clinical symptom think Investigator cause uncontrolled increased intracranial pressure , hemorrhage , edema brain 9 . Significant heart disease preclude administration anesthesia 10 . Known human immunodeficiency virus positive 11 . Ongoing treatment cytotoxic therapy ; additional antineoplastic therapy plan evidence tumor progression administration study drug 12 . Concurrent history significant medical illness Investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise subject 's ability tolerate study drug therapy and/or put subject additional risk interfere interpretation result trial 13 . Known history allergy gadolinium contrast agent 14 . Presence another type malignancy within &lt; 3 year prior screen visit , except adequately treat carcinoma insitu cervix , prostate cancer actively treat , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin 15 . Unwilling unable comply requirement protocol , include presence condition ( physical , mental , social ) likely affect subject 's return followup visit unspecified reason , opinion Investigator Sponsor , make subject 's enrollment incompatible study objective</criteria>
