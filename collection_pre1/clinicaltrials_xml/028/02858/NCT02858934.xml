	<brief_summary>The standard treatment woman relatively small breast cancer without argument involvement axillary lymph node , breast conserving surgery follow radiotherapy whole breast , often complementary dose operated area ( boost ) . A delay 3-4 week surgery advisable allow wound heal start radiotherapy . Historically , whole breast radiotherapy plus boost deliver 6-7 week . This treatment associate temporary fatigue decrease quality life . Randomized trial show short schedule , deliver slightly dose per day 3 week , equal long schedule . In earlier clinical study , investigator test short schedule show equally safe equally well tolerated conventional scheme . Other hospital examine ( still examine ) safety tolerance even short schedule , deliver radiotherapy 1 week . This clinical study involve deliver radiotherapy 1 week surgery stead follow surgery . In postoperative setting , often debatable volume include boost . Often boost-volumes remain large uncertainty delineation . Preoperative radiotherapy advantage tumor visible imaging . This result small boost volume . The surgery follow shortly termination radiotherapy , result short treatment period . This study open study investigate effect quality life short preoperative radiotherapy early breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Accelerated Preoperative Radiotherapy Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women early breast cancer treat breast conserve surgery ( BCS ) follow whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) complementary dose lumpectomy cavity ( boost ) . A delay 3-4 week surgery advisable allow wound heal start radiotherapy . Historically , WBI plus boost deliver 6-7 week . This treatment associate fatigue decrease quality life . Randomized trial show shorter hypofractionated schedule , deliver radiotherapy 3 week , equal long schedule . The investigator show hypofractionated tomotherapy simultaneous integrate boost oncologically safe , well tolerate less impact quality life conventional scheme . In postoperative setting , often debatable volume include boost . Surgical clip help decrease inter-observer variability , often boost-volumes remain large uncertainty delineation . Preoperative radiotherapy advantage gross tumor volume ( GTV ) visible image . This result small boost volume . The aim study investigate feasibility short preoperative tomotherapy . The potential benefit - decrease overall treatment time - positive effect quality life - precise target delineation - profitable health economics .</detailed_description>
