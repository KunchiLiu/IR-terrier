	<brief_summary>Although vitreous hemorrhage ( VH ) proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) cause acute dramatic vision loss patient diabetes , current , evidence-based clinical guidance treatment method likely provide best visual outcome intervention desire . Intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) therapy alone vitrectomy combined intraoperative PRP provide opportunity stabilize regress retinal neovascularization . However , clinical trial lack elucidate relative time frame visual recovery final visual outcome prompt vitrectomy compare initial anti-VEGF treatment . The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocol N demonstrate short-term trend consistent possible beneficial effect anti-VEGF treatment eye VH PDR , include great visual acuity improvement reduce rate recurrent VH compare saline injection . It possible study long duration follow-up structure anti-VEGF retreatment would demonstrate even great effectiveness anti-VEGF VH avoid vitrectomy attendant adverse event also improve visual acuity . On hand , advance surgical technique lead faster operative time , quicker patient recovery , reduce complication rate may make prompt vitrectomy attractive alternative since result immediate ability clear hemorrhage perform PRP desire , often part one procedure . This propose study evaluate safety efficacy two treatment approach eye VH PDR : prompt vitrectomy + PRP intravitreous aflibercept injection .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; = 18 year Participants &lt; 18 year old include proliferative diabetic retinopathy rare age group diagnosis may questionable . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization criterion 4 . Able willing provide inform consent . 5 . Patient willing able undergo vitrectomy within next 2 week vitrectomy schedule within time frame . 6 . Vitreous hemorrhage cause vision impairment , presume proliferative diabetic retinopathy , intervention deem necessary . Note : Prior panretinal photocoagulation neither requirement exclusion . Subhyaloid hemorrhage alone make eye eligible ; however , presence subhyaloid hemorrhage addition criterion preclude participation provide investigator comfortable either treatment regimen . 7 . Immediate vitrectomy require ( investigator participant willing wait least 4 month see hemorrhage clear sufficiently antivascular endothelial growth factor without proceed vitrectomy ) . 8 . Visual acuity letter score ≤78 ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 ) least light perception . 9 . Investigators use particular caution consider enrollment eye visual acuity letter score 69 78 ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 20/40 ) ensure need vitrectomy potential benefit outweigh potential risk . A potential participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present : 1 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis ( include placement fistula perform preparation dialysis ) kidney transplant . 2 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . 3 . Initiation intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) within 4 month prior randomization plan next 4 month . 4 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participant undergoing elective vitrectomy surgery indicate study . 5 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication study . • Note : participant receive another investigational drug participate study . 6 . Known allergy component study drug drug use injection prep ( include povidone iodine ) . 7 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 diastolic 110 ) . 8 . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , potential participant become eligible . 9 . Systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor provascular endothelial growth factor treatment within 4 month prior randomization . • These drug use study . 10 . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next two year . • Women potential participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . 11 . Potential participant expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center two year . 12 . Evidence traction detachment involve threaten macula . • If density hemorrhage preclude visual assessment clinical exam confirm eligibility , recommend assessment perform ultrasound standard care . 13 . Evidence rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . • If density hemorrhage preclude visual assessment clinical exam confirm eligibility , recommend assessment perform ultrasound standard care . 14 . Evidence neovascular glaucoma ( iris angle neovascularization exclusion ) . 15 . Known diabetic macular edema ( DME ) , define either 16 .

Diabetic macular edema clinical exam investigator believe currently require treatment . 20 . History intravitreous antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment within 2 month prior current vitreous hemorrhage onset onset . 21 . History intraocular corticosteroid treatment within 4 month prior current vitreous hemorrhage onset onset . 22 .
