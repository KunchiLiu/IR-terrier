	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder estimate annual prevalence 4 % Spain risk major depressive episode 10.6 % . Although study available , grow evidence regard fact patient affective disorder higher morbidity mortality relation general population . This mortality would duplicate mainly due suicide also factor increase metabolic risk cardiovascular disease . In Europe , depression one leading cause lose productivity , early retirement absence work due illness first cause disease burden worldwide 2030 accord World Health Organization . Several reason could explain : adverse effect medication , less access health service , unhealthy lifestyle option associate loss quality life relate health . Bipolar disorder serious mental illness affect 2 5 % population . This disease major impact patient function sixth place among disease global cause disability . Depending study , metabolic syndrome present 8 56 % patient bipolar disorder lead increase morbidity mortality affect quality life . Annual incidence rate psychosis 0.2 0.4 per 1000 population prevalence throughout life 1 % , similar men woman although start woman later . The age onset 15 30 year significant economic impact patient , family society general . Schizophrenia psychotic disorder person suffers delusion hallucination disorganize thought speech negative symptom accompany insight . Historically associate great vulnerability high rate physical comorbidity excess mortality . In physical comorbidity highlight cardiovascular disease attribute 60 % mortality together metabolic syndrome , 2-3 time frequent general population . This increase morbidity mortality relate style unhealthy life ( bad eat habit lack exercise ) , use antipsychotic drug disease intrinsic factor . There increase interest study metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) psychiatric patient recent decade . Although description evolve time , define MetS group risk factor ( abdominal obesity , elevate blood pressure , elevate fast plasma glucose , high serum triglyceride low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL cholesterol ) level ) predict onset coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , gallstone , asthma , sleep apnea , fatty liver disease several cancer . The commonly use criterion diagnosis National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP-ATP III 2003 ) , require least three follow risk factor : 1 . Elevated waist circumference : ≥102 cm men ≥88 cm woman . 2 . Elevated serum triglyceride : ≥150 mg/dL drug treatment . 3 . Reduced HDL cholesterol : &lt; 40 mg/dL men &lt; 50 mg/dL woman drug treatment . 4 . Elevated blood pressure : systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mm Hg drug treatment . 5 . Elevated fast glucose : ≥100 mg/dL drug treatment .</detailed_description>
