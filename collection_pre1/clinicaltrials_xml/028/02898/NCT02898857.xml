	<detailed_description>Every year France , 30.000 death due lung cancer 39.500 new case disease diagnose ( INCa 2014 ) . Patients suffer locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , stage IIIa , usually undergo multimodality treatment include chemotherapy platinum compound surgery ( call neoadjuvant chemotherapy induction chemotherapy ) . The reason combined modality treatment really poor prognosis patient present disease already spread lymph node ( classified N2 lymph node carina affect ) . Up till , five-year survival patient underwent surgical resection N2 NSCLC exceed 15 % . NOTCH pathway seem implicate resistance tumor chemotherapy . It known NOTCH play role homeostasis adult stem cell cancer stem cell , include intestine cancer NSCLC . In breast cancer , demonstrate NOTCH 1 play role relapse add treatment inhibitor NOTCH decrease recurrence rate . An activation NOTCH pathway proven human lung cancer cell line ( A549 H460 ) treat cisplatin . Furthermore , HES1 ( Hairy enhance split ) , downstream gene result NOTCH transcription , upregulated patient relapse compare resistant versus non-resistant adenocarcinoma NSCLC patient . It prove , NOTCH pathway associate overall survival NSCLC . Recently , show inhibitor NOTCH combine chemotherapy strongly potentiate anti-tumor effect systemic therapy . Therefore , one hypothesize platinum compound-induced NOTCH activation contribute resistance NSCLC beyond point , tumor progression .</detailed_description>
