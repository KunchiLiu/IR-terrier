	<brief_title>A Study Local Therapy Treatment Brain Metastases From HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast cancer , metastasise brain , main treatment option brain metastasis Whole Brain Radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) Neurosurgery ( NS ) . The purpose study determine : 1. . How likely tumour control treatment local therapy Neurosurgery ( NS ) and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) . 2. . How likely tumour develop new site brain Whole Brain Radiotherapy ( WBRT ) give . This study aim recruit 50 participant HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer 1-5 synchronous brain metastasis , least one metastasis require treatment . The local treatment offer determine participant 's doctor consultation site multidisciplinary team dependent size location brain metastasis . Each treatment perform specialist field , i.e . neurosurgeon and/or radiation oncologist . Neurosurgery : The decision whether recommend neurosurgery make independently research study . The surgery may perform 6 week participant register trial 4 week registration . The complexity length surgery depend size location tumour ( ) . Sometimes stereotactic radiosurgery require deliver cavity leave metastasis remove ( also know cavity boost ) . Timing Cavity SRS discretion treat team . SRS cavity boost must give registration give 8 week NS resection . Stereotactic Radiosurgery : If participant receive stereotactic radiosurgery ( either alone combination neurosurgery ) , Radiation Oncologist organise participant Radiotherapy planning . Treatment commence within 4 week study registration . The size , number location brain metastasis determine dose fractionation schedule radiotherapy . Single metastasis , small equal 2cm , may require 1 fraction . Alternately , multiple metastasis , metastasis brain stem , big 2cm required multiple fraction treat . The dose range study 20Gy/1 fraction 24Gy/3 fraction . Each fraction give separate day . All participant follow 3 monthly interval 12 month complete trial treatment ( i.e . day last SRS treatment neurosurgery , latter two ) . At follow-up visit clinic visit study doctor ass symptom , record current medication and/or surgery , monitor brain metastasis , blood test imaging ( CT scan , bone scan MRI brain ) .</detailed_description>
