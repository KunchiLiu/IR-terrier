	<brief_summary>Levels PCT ( marker bacterial infection ) high sepsis : fact , PCT normally produce C cell thyroid gland . PCT initially study Assicot1 distinguish bacterial meningitis viral meningitis . The CALC-I gene code PCT . In absence infection , extrathyroid mRNA expression CALC-I gene repress , expression restrict neuroendocrine thyroid pulmonary cell . Infection induce ubiquitous expression CALC-I gene . PCT transform calcitonin parenchymatous tissue . In context sepsis , whole body act neuroendocrine gland . Sepsis upregulates PCT mRNA expression much cytokine . PCT use critical care department diagnostic marker , guide treatment ( antibiotic withdraw level fall ) prognostic marker . There data diagnostic use PCT internal medicine department . The available study yield contradictory result one prospective study perform . The objective study PCT non-infectious , inflammatory pathology establish whether PCT could distinguish infection inflammatory pathology patient internal medicine department . In ROC curve analysis , PCT threshold 0.35 µmol/l give great specificity ( 88 % ) sensitivity ( 72 % ) . Other study perform feature small sample size retrospective design . Of various study perform internal medicine department , none include patient present suspected bacterial infection ( accord clinician 's interpretation ) lack information bacterial status . In fact , diagnose core component hospitalisation internal medicine department fever inflammatory syndrome . The investigator intend include patient , include lack information microbiological status ) .</brief_summary>
