	<brief_title>Development Validation Automated Indicators Appropriateness Oral Anticoagulant Prescriptions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appropriateness oral anticoagulant prescription ( Vitamin K Antagonists Direct Oral Anticoagulants ) major challenge improve quality , safety efficiency care . The large targeted population , prescription frequency strong risk severe adverse event , especially healthcare institution , justify importance develop indicator appropriateness oral anticoagulant prescription automate implementation hospital information system . There currently need develop validate indicator integrate hospital clinical practice , part structure approach improve quality safety care . As hospital information system different , investigator want propose transposable tool healthcare institution allow automated construction indicator . The study consist three main step : 1 ) identification indicator appropriateness oral anticoagulant prescription condition appropriateness ( literature review ) , analysis potential utility operational characteristic ( Delphi consensus ) ; 2 ) operational implementation select indicator hospital information system , use tool generalize implementation hospital information system ; 3 ) evaluation metrological performance robustness select indicator . This observation prescription occur without modification change treatment patient . This study never Interventional . Statistical analysis : indicator , criterion validity analyze thanks prevalence appropriateness ( ) oral anticoagulant prescription estimate hospital information system , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , area ROC curve .</detailed_description>
