	<brief_summary>The moderate-to-severe pain many patient experience follow orthopedic surgery often treat opioids , associate side effect nausea/vomiting , sedation , respiratory depression ( risk abuse ) . Potent site-specific analgesia few side effect may provide `` continuous peripheral nerve block , '' involve percutaneous insertion catheter adjacent peripheral nerve ( ) supply surgical site . Local anesthetic introduce via catheter . However , major problem continuous nerve block dramatically limit use outside academic center . Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) `` nerve modulation '' alternative method pain control involve insertion electrical lead introduce needle—obviating open surgical incision placement—followed introduction electric current produce analgesia . This modality use treat chronic pain , evaluate randomize , control study apply acute pain management ( post-surgical analgesia ) . This temporary therapy multiple theoretical benefit exist analgesic , lack systemic side effect ( e.g. , nausea , respiratory depression ) , absence induced muscle weakness , reduce risk adverse event ( e.g . infection ) . The purpose propose randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled , crossover , feasibility study explore possibility treat postoperative pain ultrasound-guided percutaneous PNS , , help power subsequent definitive randomize , control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Written , inform consent obtain use IRB-approved ICF prior study procedure . Lead insertion may occur 2 week prior surgery within CTRI , morning surgery regional anesthesia induction area ( depend subject surgeon preference , well logistical issue time surgery availability investigator ) . Muscle strength measure pressure transducer . Preoperative lead insertion ( approximately 1-3 hour ) . A percutaneous , helically-coiled , insulated electrical lead insert via introducer needle least 2 cm proximal distal perineural catheter location along target nerve use real-time ultrasound guidance : Surgical Procedure Location : Perineural Catheter Location , Electrical Lead Location Shoulder : Interscalene , Interscalene supraclavicular At distal elbow : Infraclavicular , Interscalene , supraclavicular terminal nerve ( ) Foot ankle : Popliteal-sciatic [ adductor canal optional ] , Subgluteal-sciatic [ femoral optional ] Knee distal thigh : Adductor canal [ popliteal-sciatic optional ] , Femoral [ subgluteal-sciatic optional ] It optional conduct probe use prior lead insertion—this allow identification optimal lead tip location relative target nerve pass electrical current via insulated probe . The desired end point pleasant paresthesia distribution target nerve report subject . If use , probe completely withdrawn follow target location identification , lead subsequently insert target location . Following needle removal , percutaneous helical lead electric current pass use SPRINT ( SPR Therapeutics , Cleveland , OH ) pulse generator ensure accurate placement ( pleasant paresthesia distribution target nerve ) . It replace , necessary . Muscle strength measure pressure transducer delivery electrical current . The pulse generator remove lead affixed skin use occlusive dressing . With subject 's permission investigator may photograph videotape procedure describe educational , training , publication purpose . The photos video focus lead insertion site affect limb . Ultrasound image procedure may also collect . Every effort make protect subject 's privacy photo video include subject 's face personal identifier birthmark . Subjects caretaker train device care management , give write instruction well . Following successful lead insertion , perineural catheter may insert , patient desire catheter ( normal saline injection local anesthetic via insert needle ) . This use deliver perineural local anesthetic rescue analgesic method postoperatively case SPRINT system provide inadequate analgesia . Randomization . Within recovery room , surgeon often perform standard neurologic examination ( variable depend surgeon surgical procedure ) , time subject baseline end point measure , include pain score surgical site use Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS , 0-10 ) , pain score ( NRS ) within target nerve distribution , sensory deficit ( measure alcohol pad von Frey filament compare contralateral limb within cutaneous distribution target nerve ) . For first pulse generator— '' Stimulator A '' —subjects randomize one two treatments—current sham—using computer generate list opaque , seal envelope . The stimulator attach lead switch `` '' ( sham stimulator produce current ) . The end point measure per table . Subsequently , stimulator replace alternative ( current sham ) — '' Stimulator B '' . The subject end point measure stimulator replace unit set deliver active current remainder study participation ( `` Stimulator C '' ) . Operating recovery room pharmacologic analgesic requirement record . Of note , lead fails provide paresthesia within target nerve distribution either Stimulator A B ( adjustment stimulator setting allow ) , lead may replace discretion subject investigator . End point collection ( first day within recovery room ; approximately 30 minute ) : Baseline , stimulator A activate ( sham real ) Minutes 1-5 , stimulator B activate ( sham real ) Minutes 1-5 , stimulator C activate ( always real ) Minute 5 30 within recovery room Daily x 14 day Months 1 3 Endpoints include numeric rating scale pain ( NRS ) surgical site rest movement , lead-related NRS ( pain lead site ) , muscle strength , sensory deficit , question `` adequate analgesia ? '' nominal response yes . Of note , data derive chronic pain literature suggest `` carry '' effect follow stimulation : analgesia provide even cessation electrical current . It remain unknown true follow surgery acute postoperative pain period . For subject randomize active current Stimulator A , data collect Stimulator B placebo treatment may lower due carry effect . Therefore , data compare baseline Stimulator A outcome measure . However , valuable data possibly detect quantify carry-over effect initial stimulation . At time , subject may choose perineural catheter bolused local anesthetic perineural local anesthetic infusion begin ( desire catheter subsequent insertion ) . Therefore , subject risk receive inferior analgesia participate study . However , subject also option leave infusion pump use neuromodulation primary analgesic latter prove adequate—the decision completely subject 's may make time prior perineural catheter removal . Subjects caretaker train device care management , give write instruction well . Pain score ( rest dynamic bad average ) collect daily two week , along oral analgesic requirement , perineural local anesthetic use , sensory/motor deficit ( specific previous 24 hour ) . Perineural catheter remove home upon subject request , 3 day , upon local anesthetic reservoir exhaustion , whichever come first ( standard-of-care ) . The electrical lead remove upon subject request , 30 day , whichever come first . The lead remove home subject caretaker ( standard-of-care perineural catheter withdrawal ) investigator , depend investigator subject preference . If remove subject caretaker , picture extract lead tip must texted/emailed investigator , physical lead return investigator inspection . Subjects contact less every 5 day follow initial 2-week period lead remove ; , contact 1 3 month postoperatively end point verbally collect .</detailed_description>
