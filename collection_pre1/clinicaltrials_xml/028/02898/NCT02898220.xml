	<brief_summary>The Multidisciplinary Approach Study Chronic Pelvic Pain ( MAPP ) Research Network establish National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) focus broad approach study Interstitial Cystitis ( IC ) / Bladder Pain Syndrome ( BPS ) men woman , Chronic Prostatitis ( CP ) /Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome ( CPPS ) men , previously undertake . Patients IC CP recruit new study call `` Trans-MAPP Study Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain : Symptom Patterns Study ( SPS ) . This research study recruit Control Participants well understand symptom individual form IC CP . As many chronic pain disorder , IC CP poorly understand , treatment often helpful . The goal study well understand pain felt people IC CP investigator hope study lead improvement treatment IC CP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trans-MAPP II Study Urologic Chronic Pelvin Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes ( UCPPS ) characterize pelvic pain concurrent urinary symptom . Broadly , UCPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder SyndromeBladder Pain Syndrome ( IC/BPS ) men woman , Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) men . IC debilitate bladder disorder characterize urinary urgency , frequency , pain . The presentation symptoms quite variable among patient , suggest IC multi-factorial syndrome several propose etiology , may interrelated.1 BPS define International Continence Society , `` complaint suprapubic pain related bladder filling , accompany symptom , increase daytime night-time frequency , absence proven urinary infection obvious pathology . `` 2 BPS clinical description disease base patient 's symptom , depend urodynamic cystoscopic finding . These symptom may relate IC , although diagnostic criterion still lack entity , relationship BPS IC clear . After initiation phase MAPP SPS Study , become clear many hypothesis propose require well-characterized healthy `` normal '' control lack urologic pain well study related symptoms/conditions . This second phase enrich pre-defined subgroup longer follow-up period allow investigation clinical biologic factor associate worsen and/or improvement report urinary non-urinary symptom .</detailed_description>
