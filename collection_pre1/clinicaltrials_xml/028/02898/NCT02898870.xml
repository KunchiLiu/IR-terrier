	<detailed_description>The link product synthetic chemistry cancer heart much research . Recent work identify use plant protection agent farmer risk factor develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma , include diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) common histology . Different biological model use understand role pesticide lymphomagenesis . To summarize , pesticide act cellular molecular level , different signal pathway . After metabolized cytochrome P450 , compound generally become pro-oxidants . The increase reactive oxygen specie rate ( SAR ) cause activation signal pathway involve cell proliferation survival . But deregulation oxidative status justify specificity impact pesticide specific pathology . Several agent genotoxic effect , others induce activation signal pathway bind transcription factor others immunomodulating property . Among four mechanism pesticide involve lymphomagenesis , two also associate resistance chemotherapy . Thus , genotoxic agent lead implementation process DNA repair , use repair genotoxic lesion induce chemotherapeutic agent evade apoptosis . On hand , survive high level ROS , tumor cell raise level antioxidant defense , maintain redox homeostasis prevent oxidative stress . However , high production antioxidant constitute barrier effectiveness anti-tumor agent effective generation oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
