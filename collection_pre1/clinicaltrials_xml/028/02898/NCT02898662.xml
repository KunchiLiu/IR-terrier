	<detailed_description>Ph2a study plan run approximately 16-18 site 4 EU country ( Denmark , Hungary , Poland Sweden ) enrol approximately 170 patient ensure 70 randomized patient eosinophilic , moderate severe asthma . The study withdrawal design.The patient receive 13 weekly inhale dos study drug ( AZD1419 placebo ) . Treatment initiate 6 dos study drug top ICS/LABA controller medication . Prior 7th dose study drug LABA withdrawn . The follow 3 dos give ICS taper . Dose 7 give top 100 % ICS , dose 8 give top 50 % ICS dose , taper 25 % follow week withdrawn completely prior dose 10 study drug . During last 3 week treatment ( ie last 4 dos ) , study drug give monotherapy . SABA use reliever medication whole study period . Primary endpoint Loss asthma control , define follow criterion : ) An increase ACQ-5 1.5 b ) A reduction 30 % morning peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) baseline 2 consecutive day c ) At least six additional reliever inhalation SABA 24-hour period relative baseline 2 consecutive day ) An exacerbation require systemic corticosteroid When endpoint meet , patient resume regular ICS/LABA controller medication follow additional 4 week , Early Discontinuation ( ED ) Visit thereafter leave study . For patient loose asthma control , full Observational period week 52 , End Treatment Visit ( EOT ) . Study procedures ED EOT Visits .</detailed_description>
