	<brief_summary>Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations ( Pah ) Are Studied As An Indirect Measure Of Access To Primary Care And Of The Interface Between Primary And Secondary Care . A Previous Work Unveils Considerable Geographic Variation In The Rate Of Pah In France And Suggest That Primary Care Organization Might Play A Role In This Variation . However , A Limitation Of This Work Lies In The Lack Of Data On Actual Primary Care Utilization . The Aim Of This Study Is To Analyze The Role Of Primary Care In The Variation Of Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations At Zip Code Level , In The French Region Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyrénées . The investigator implement An Ecological Approach In Which The Geographic Variation In The Rate Of Pah Is Analyzed In The French Region Lrmp , Year 2014 . Age- And Sex-Adjusted Rate Of Pah By Zip Codes ( N=612 ) Is Modeled Using A Spatial Regression Model .</brief_summary>
