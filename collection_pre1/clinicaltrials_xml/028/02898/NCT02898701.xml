	<brief_summary>This study contain two pilot study : 1 ) one study investigate practice dosage postural step task healthy young individual order determine operational definition performance plateau , 2 ) study investigate whether practice beyond reach performance plateau improve learn postural step task healthy old adult , compare discontinuing practice immediately reach performance plateau . The investigator hypothesize group continue practice beyond reach performance plateau learn retain motor task well group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Overpractice Improve Motor Learning ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What ideal amount , dose , practice need person learn motor skill ? Studies suggest `` good , '' optimal dose motor practice unknown . Motor learn define set internal process lead relatively permanent change capability motor skill . Older adult people neurological disorder critical need learn relearn motor skill remain independent , standard clinical rehabilitation currently provide practice dos insufficient result motor learning . Under-dosing practice result sub-optimal clinical outcome , research study dose insufficiently identify between-group difference prone misinterpretation . Therefore , essential clinical care research determine practice dose need optimize motor learning . Performance curve ( i.e. , plots average performance group individual number practice trial block trial ) demonstrate performance improves ( e.g. , error decrease speed increase ) practice , point performance improvement begin plateau . Additional practice provide beyond point individual reach performance plateau term overpractice . Amounts practice insufficient reach plateau tend demonstrate motor learning , overpractice typically result retention practice task . Pilot Study # 1 : The first pilot study include healthy young adult randomly assign practice postural step task one day , five consecutive day practice . The investigator use data determine operational definition ( i.e. , mathematical definition ) performance plateau . This definition use differentiate group Pilot Study # 2 . Pilot Study # 2 : The second pilot study include healthy old adult divide three group : standard care group ( i.e . low dose , overpractice group , overpractice group . All group practice postural step task . The experimental group overpractice ( OVP ) group , participant complete 100 % additional practice trial reach performance plateau . In contrast , two active control group overpractice ( NoOVP ) group ( participant stop practice immediately reach performance plateau ) , standard care ( SoC ) group ( participant perform one block practice ) .</detailed_description>
