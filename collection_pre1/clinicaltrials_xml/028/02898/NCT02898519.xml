	<brief_summary>Leptospirosis zoonotic infection induce pathogen bacteria ( genus : Leptospira ) grow water pollute animal fluid . Due 10 fold occurence French overseas aera , especially Reunion Island , compare metropoly , consider major public health issue . An important inter-individual variability humoral immune response suggest vaccination recommend exposed subject . This cohort study aim determine subject infect leptospirosis 1 7 year still remain immunized , need vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response After Leptospirosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year 500 000 severe form leptospirosis diagnose Reunion Island . The risk mucocutaneous contact contaminate medium remain important due highly aqueous environment . Cured subject infect 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 year enrol . The qualitative quantitative humoral immune response leptospirosis infection also evaluate determine whether still get protective immunization . Leptospirosis immunization evaluate use micro-agglutination test . Graded immune response related severity length infection also investigate . Finally , 3 method use leptospirosis diagnosis compare . It expect study evaluate appropriate condition new vaccination could require prevent leptospirosis infection cure subject .</detailed_description>
