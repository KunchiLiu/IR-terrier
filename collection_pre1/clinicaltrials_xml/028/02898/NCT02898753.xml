	<brief_title>VAL-1221 Delivered Intravenously Ambulatory Ventilator-free Patients With Late-Onset Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol consecutive manner randomize either treatment VAL-1221 positive control ( rhGAA ) cohorts patient : Cohort 1 : VAL-1221 1 mg/kg IV ( n=3 ) every week control ( n=1 ) Cohort 2 : VAL-1221 3 mg/kg IV ( n=3 ) every week control ( n=1 ) Cohort 3 : VAL-1221 10 mg/kg IV ( n=3 ) every week control ( n=1 ) Each patient randomize VAL-1221 receive 7 every week IV infusion VAL-1221 12 week . VAL-1221 cohort enrol sequential fashion . Patients randomize rhGAA maintain current dose regimen Myozyme Lumizyme . The first patient cohort receive VAL-1221 follow safety concern ( include infusion related reaction ) minimum 48 hour remain VAL-1221-treated patient cohort receive infusion . Once patient cohort enrol Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review least one month safety data patient , next cohort may begin enrollment treatment . A final assessment occur approximately 2 week last dose VAL-1221 collect additional safety data . Safety assess continuously throughout study . All patient complete study , include maintain rhGAA , offer inclusion extension study optimal dose VAL-1221 determine .</detailed_description>
