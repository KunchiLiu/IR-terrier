	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTDs ) olaparib Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 ( AT13387 ) administer combination patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity associate olaparib AT13387 administer combination assessed Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 . II . To determine recommended phase 2 dos ( RP2D ) combination olaparib AT13387 . III . To determine plasma pharmacokinetics olaparib AT13387 . IV . To document anti-tumor activity combination olaparib AT13387 assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 progression free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 ( course 0 ) . Beginning course 1 , patient receive olaparib PO BID day 1-28 Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
