	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control trial compare cold compression intervention immediately prior intrauterine device insertion . Inclusion criterion include non-pregnant woman , 18 year age old , present VCU Women 's Health clinic desire IUD placement . Subjects identified time presentation Women 's Health Clinics Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems . A provider ( physician , nurse practioner , nurse midwife ) discus study subject . After time consideration question answer subject consent trial . Consent obtain time ( see attach list engage provider ) . Randomization perform pull sequentially number opaque envelope contain computer randomize individual allocation . This randomization carry research staff initiation study . Information regard basic demographic data , comorbidities may affect patient 's perception pain obtain subject ' chart . This information include : age , race , socioeconomic status , status practitioner , parity , BMI , history prior cervical procedure , history chronic pain . If subject elect participate study randomize cold compression group , cold compress place abdomen five minute prior throughout intrauterine device placement . Visual acuity pain scale commonly use similar study objectively assess procedural pain . In study , validate 10 point visual acuity scale use . Pain assessed pre- post-procedure . The post-procedure question direct pain procedure . Comparable study ass procedural pain consider 30 % reduction pain significant . Based study similarly consider 30 % reduction pain experimental control group significant . With power 80 significance value p &lt; 0.05 , require 69 patient group ( cold compression versus no-intervention ) obtain adequate sample size detect difference group . The study power post-treatment mean control group 2.8 4.0 ( respectively ) , 30 % difference , assume SD=2.8 use two-sample t-test . Paper copy write consent identify information keep secure , lock file . All data collect stored password protect computer file accessible investigator . The primary outcome difference patient 's perception pain intrauterine device insertion . This define base pre post-procedure survey use 10-point visual analogue scale . Additionally , nulliparous multiparous woman stratify previous study show significantly different pain score report two subgroup . The investigator collect data , perform data entry review chart ensure accuracy information provide inserting physician . Periodic review data entry perform ensure completeness accuracy .</detailed_description>
