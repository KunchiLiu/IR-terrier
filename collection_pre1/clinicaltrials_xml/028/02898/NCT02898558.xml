	<brief_summary>This study explore possible implication increase perceive body size rehabilitation motor function . In recent study test motor ability patient stroke improve wear magnify lens , show beneficial effect magnify lens observe patient . In present study , identify 12 patient cohort demonstrate improvement great 10 % one two motor task wear magnify glass . These participant invite take part clinical study undergo training phase : subject wear magnify lens home 30 minute daily 14 day complete jigsaw puzzle ; log keep document participation . Participants ' performance different motor task assess , immediately 1 month training session . Standardized measure motor performance include Action Research Arm test Rivermead Assessment Somatosensory Performance ( RASP ) . In addition , participant undergo grip strength , finger tap task reach grasp task . We expect repeat use magnify lens generate improvement patient ' performance across task effect persistent time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Altering apparent size body part magnify change tactile acuity , tactile distance judgment pain perception . In recent study test motor ability ( grip strength , finger tap reach grasp ) patient stroke improve wear magnify lens . The result study show beneficial effect magnify lens movement observe patient stroke . The present study aim follow result investigate possible use magnifying lenses rehabilitation improve motor control stroke patient . To pursuit aim , identify 12 patient previous study cohort demonstrate improvement great 10 % grip strength finger tap task wear magnify glass . These participant invite take part present clinical study undergo training phase : subject wear magnify lens home 30 minute daily 14 day complete jigsaw puzzle ; log keep document participation . Participants ' performance different motor task assess , immediately 1 month training session . Standardized measure motor performance include Action Research Arm test Rivermead Assessment Somatosensory Performance ( RASP ) . In addition , participant undergo grip strength ( 6 trial ) , finger tap task ( 6 trial ) reach grasp task , inn ask reach grasp 3 different object ( 30 trial ) . We expect repeat use magnify lens generate improvement patient ' performance across task effect persistent time .</detailed_description>
