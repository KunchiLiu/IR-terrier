	<detailed_description>Objectives : The propose research study evaluate feasibility efficacy early parent-focused intervention prevent development PTSD child admit hospital suffer medical injury at-risk develop PTSD . Children present ED injury sufficient warrant admission hospital ( see criterion trauma admission ) , show risk PTSD accord standardized assessment parent approach participate study . After consenting/assenting participate research , child parent randomize receive study intervention treatment usual . The primary goal measure difference study group PTSD diagnosis severity 1- . 3- , 6-months post trauma , well difference comorbid diagnosis ( e.g. , depression ) , global/scholastic functioning , domain target intervention ( e.g. , sleep quality , life stress , social support ) . The secondary goal measure impact parental/ family factor ( e.g. , parental pathology family stressor ) child 's trajectory pathology resilience . The final goal identify salient change methylation level parent child trauma relationship change development symptom maladaptive coping . The study bring together multidisciplinary team medical psychological professional build upon grow literature support use target early intervention prevent PTSD . Specific Aims Hypotheses : 1 . Determine preliminary efficacy parent-focused , early intervention prevent development chronic PTSD trauma-related outcome child expose acute , traumatic injury , parent . Outcomes measured child self-report , parental self-report , parental report child intake follow-up assessment ( 1- , 3- , 6-months post trauma ) . It hypothesize treatment group ( early intervention ) show significantly low rate PTSD symptom associate marker psychological function high well-being follow-up assessment compare treatment usual ( TAU ) group . Also , child parent factor predict development PTSD treatment response . Finally , slope symptom change parent child relate across time group , slope symptom change moderate treatment group , parent child receive treatment show great reduction symptom time . 2 . Evaluate feasibility parent-focused , early intervention prevent development chronic PTSD child expose acute , traumatic injury . Feasibility determine participant enrollment dropout rate , well participant subjective rating satisfaction treatment . It hypothesize intervention well-received participant participant enrollment goal meet . 3 . Understand trajectory epigenetics ( methylation level ) trauma relationship methylation level psychological functioning parent child . The investigator also , investigate impact early intervention epigenetics parent child expose acute injury . Study Design : The propose study utilize longitudinal design measure effect early intervention prevent development PTSD symptom child ( parent ) expose acute traumatic injury . Parent/child dyads enter study initial assessment admission hospital , within approximately 24-48 hour trauma . CHMCA follow recommendation American College Surgeons Committee Trauma determine whether patient 's injury sufficient necessitate trauma admission . Criteria activate Trauma Team response either physiologic ( base HR , blood pressure , mental status , etc ) anatomic ( base extent identify injury , presence fracture , penetrate injury torso/head , chest wall injury , etc ) , combination two . Once trauma team call , patient typically admit minimum 15 hour . As part trauma admission process , patient screen PTSD severity use STEPP . PTSD risk base measure one inclusion criterion study.Those enrol study assign 4 session early intervention treatment usual group . Parent/child dyad assess 1 month , 3 month 6 month post-trauma . The longitudinal design allow prospective measurement effect predictive factor development PTSD treatment response .</detailed_description>
