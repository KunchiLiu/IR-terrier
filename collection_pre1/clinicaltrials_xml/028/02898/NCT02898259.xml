	<detailed_description>Primary : To determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity combination oral ixazomib lenalidomide plus rituximab patient previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma high tumor burden GELF criterion FLIPI 3-5 Secondary : - To determine overall response rate expand cohort MTD follicular lymphoma non-follicular low-grade B cell lymphoma - Duration response , time progression , progression free survival , time treatment failure overall survival - Create tissue microarray paraffin embed tissue future study . - Assessment baseline lymphocyte subset prognostic marker . - Assessment blood flow cytometric evaluation minimal residual disease post-treatment correlation PFS Overview Study Design : This study combine three class agents non-overlapping mechanism action toxicity profile , pair demonstrate clinical evidence benefit without unexpected toxicity . We use lenalidomide-rituximab backbone , feasible active lymphoma , add novel oral proteasome inhibitor potentially enhance efficacy , minimize toxicity limit patient visit treatment . Patients previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma high tumor burden GELF criterion FLIPI 3-5 treated combination oral ixazomib + lenalidomide + rituximab . The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity regimen . The study use standard 3 + 3 design determination MTD cycle 1 . There three dose level escalation , follow two expansion cohort 12 patient MTD , one cohort follicular lymphoma one cohort non-follicular low-grade lymphoma ( SLL , marginal zone , lymphoplasmacytic ) .</detailed_description>
