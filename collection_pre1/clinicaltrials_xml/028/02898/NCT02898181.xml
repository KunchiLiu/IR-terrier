	<brief_summary>Acute Decompensated Heart Failure ( ADHF ) major cause morbidity mortality . It associate increased systemic inflammation . Previous study demonstrate increased level cytokine C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNFα ) patient heart failure ( HF ) . Increased activity sympathetic nervous system ADHF link inflammation . Previous anti-inflammatory drug therapy HF demonstrate significant impact cardiovascular outcome . Low-level vagus nerve stimulation ( LLVNS ) non-invasive way modulate autonomic tone thereby inflammation . Vagal nerve stimulation think increase parasympathetic activity suppress sympathetic activity . Clinical study vagal stimulation chronic HF negative . Recent experimental clinical data suggest low level tragus nerve stimulation ( LLTNS ) may produce desired neuromodulator effect compare LLVNS . It however unknown LLTNS ADHF directly lead reduction level pro-inflammatory cytokine ( CRP , IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-α ) increase level anti-inflammatory marker IL-10.The objective proposal determine impact LLTS inflammatory cytokine patient ADHF . Patients randomize either active stimulation ( ~8 hour daily ) . Serum collect ( post admission day 2 , 3 4 post admission ) use cytokine measurement . This investigation likely establish first evidence effect LLTS suppression inflammation patient present ADHF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Specific aim 1 . To examine effect intermittent ( ~8 hour daily ) LLTS inflammatory cytokine ( CRP , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 TNFα ) patient present Acute Decompensated Heart Failure relative control group . 2 . Patients randomize either active LLTS control group . 3 . LLTS deliver transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) device ~8 hour daily course hospital stay . 4 . Change level inflammatory cytokine compare two group pre-specified time point , use repeat measure ANOVA . These cytokine measure use multiplex immunoassay . Gene expression inflammatory cytokine measure peripheral blood monocyte , use commercially available microarrays . B . Background significance Heart Failure ( HF ) major cause morbidity mortality United States . It estimate approximately 5.1 million Americans suffer Heart Failure number annular discharge heart failure exceed 1 million . Although survival significantly improve patient heart failure absolute mortality date heart failure remain approximately 50 % within 5 year diagnosis.While several clinically proven treatment strategy exist patient chronic heart failure limit data exists patient present ADHF . The quest newer therapy continue . Although clear link establish inflammation heart failure , therapy target inflammatory cascade disappointing . Randomized clinical trial target cytokine use wide array drug therapy fail demonstrate meaningful reduction cardiovascular outcome . None trial enrol patient ADHF variation inflammatory cytokine level uniformly report across study . Inflammation play central role heart failure . The important cytokine implicate progression heart failure CRP , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) , interleukin ( IL ) 1 , IL-6 IL-10 . TNF-α elevate HF patient reduce ejection fraction ( EF ) . Increased concentration IL-6 show circulation ADHF patient . IL-1 along TNF-α generally think prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine . IL-1 demonstrate myocardium patient idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy . IL-10 one important anti-inflammatory cytokine . It known regulate production TNF-α , IL-1 , IL-6 , respectively . In study Kaneko et.al , CRP value 188 patient idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy assess . All patient impaired ejection fraction le 40 % . Those patient die follow period five year significantly high CRP concentration survive . Vagal stimulation ( VS ) appear direct effective way increase vagal tone . To date , 2 clinical study VS human negative . It previously demonstrate similar level VS achieve non-invasively stimulate auricular branch vagus nerve via LLTNS . Low level Tragus stimulation mimic effect direct vagal nerve stimulation . Our group demonstrate LLTNS significantly reduce inflammatory cytokine patient AF undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation . To knowledge data suggest modulate autonomic nervous system via LLTNS ( increase parasympathetic tone reduce sympathetic nervous system activity ) would lead reduction circulate pro-inflammatory cytokine patient admit ADHF . Since concept test previously embark idea use autonomic modulation via LLTNS reduce level systemic inflammation rampant patient admit ADHF . We hypothesize LLTNS lead reduction level pro-inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-α , IL-1 , IL-6 , CRP ) reduce anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 , patient admit ADHF . C. Preliminary study The investigator intend perform first human pilot study determine impact LLTNS inflammatory cytokine patient present ADHF . D. Research design Methods This prospective , randomize , control pilot study . Patients present ADHF OU Medical Center eligible inclusion study . Definition ADHF : Acute Decompensated Heart Failure ( ADHF ) define sudden gradual onset sign symptom heart failure require unplanned office visit emergency room visit lead hospitalization . Regardless underlie precipitant exacerbation , pulmonary systemic congestion due increase left- right-heart filling pressure nearly universal find ADHF . Patients recruit inpatient service University Oklahoma Health Sciences Center . Study coordinator screen patient meet inclusion criterion enrol . Informed consent obtain prior enrollment study . The randomization schedule implement use central computerized system . Blocked randomization use decrease chance imbalance two group time . After informed consent screening procedure complete , patient undergo baseline blood draw inflammatory marker . Patients randomly assign ( 1:1 ) active control group . The clinical coordinator instruct patient proper use device . These study personnel designate address patient ' question concern well record side effect relate use device . Active LLTS perform use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) device electrode attach tragus ear , innervate auricular branch vagus nerve . In active group , ear clip electrode attach tragus active stimulation group . TENS apply continuously 8 hour daily ( 4 hour twice daily ) The clinical coordinator instruct patient proper use device . In patient pacemaker , pacemaker test TENS unit assess interaction . In case interaction ( stimulation artifact TENS unit pick pacemaker ) , patient exclude study . The choice treatment ADHF leave discretion treat physician . The experimental device use addition medication ; word , device use individual continue treatment ADHF . Patients enrol study 12 month ( total duration study ) . During baseline hospital admission complete history physical examination do one investigator . Laboratory data , electrocardiographic data echocardiographic data also review . 20ml blood drawn cytokine analysis . Investigators intend recruit 80 patient . Blood sample ( 20ml ) collect baseline daily AM ( day 2,3 4 ) throughout hospital stay . Samples centrifuge within 30 minute collection ( 2000 rcf 10 min ) , serum store aliquot -80°C assay . Patients ' serum save frozen process batch 6 8 . The investigator perform cytokine assay blind group assignment . All assay run Lab OUHSC . Inflammatory cytokine , include TNF-α , CRP IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 measure use commercially available immunoassay analyze flow cytometer ( multiplex assay ) . In addition , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) isolate use MACS magnetic bead purification . Inflammatory cytokine gene expression profile measure time point , use commercially available microarrays . Finally , investigator determine cytokine response LLTS identify predictor response base baseline cytokine level . It known vagus nerve stimulation attenuate inflammation cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway . If pathway important ADHF , investigator expect decrease cytokine LLTNS . Duration participation : Enrolled patient participate study index hospital admission . Patient enrollment : A maximum 80 patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion enrol study . The enrollment period expect last least 12 month , give average 15 patient ADHF see hospital month assume 1 3 eligible patient would agree participate study . E. Statistical methods The primary outcome study percent reduction inflammatory cytokine hospital stay . Markers inflammation compare group use repeated measure ANOVA , 4 time point ( baseline , day 1 post admission , day 2 post admission discharge day ) 3 term include model ( group effect , time effect , group time interaction ) . Significant interaction follow time trend analyse stratified intervention group . For pair-wise testing , adjust multiple comparison use Tukey 's method . Analyses base intention-to-treat principle . Statistical significance declare 5 % . Sample size power calculation : This first human study test concept LLTNS ADHF . Since pilot feasibility study accurate sample size size calculation perform .
