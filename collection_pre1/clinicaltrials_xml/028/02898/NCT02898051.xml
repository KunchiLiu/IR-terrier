	<detailed_description>Purpose study : The primary purpose study compare pharmacokinetics anti-Xa activity patient cancer patient without cancer treat curative dose low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . The secondary purpose 1/ study correlation anti-Xa LMWH concentration plasma heparanase 2/ evaluate predictive nature anti-Xa activity occurrence thromboembolic recurrence cancer patient treat LMWH VTE . Study design : Multicentre cohort study patient hospitalize VTE : 1 . Observational case-control study compare pharmacodynamics anti-Xa activity patient cancer patient ( n = 50 ) non-cancer patient ( n = 50 ) match ( 1-1 ) age , renal function LMWH 2 . A prospective cohort study include 320 cancer patient 6 month follow-up . Study hypothesis : Venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism common complication cancer . They complicate 10 % cancer cause fatality , morbidity significant impaired quality life . The treatment diseases difficult context . Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) reference molecule long term treatment venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) cancer patient . Outside context , pharmacological property allow administer fix dose without measure anti-Xa activity . In presence cancer , use remains , however , associate high risk recurrent thromboembolism 9 % 6 month treatment . This high rate recurrence may result alteration pharmacokinetics LMWH presence cancer . The synthesis heparanase tumor cell might cause decrease anti-Xa activity LMWH reduce effectiveness . If hypothesis verify , could result change management thrombosis cancer patient lead dose adjustment LMWH measurement anti-Xa activity , may allow reduce incidence thromboembolic relapse treatment . Enrollment ( Target Actual Number Subjects ) : 1 . Pharmacokinetics study In preliminary unpublished study 37 cancer non-cancer subject high concentration anti-Xa activity measure . Included 100 subject ( 50 cancer patient 50 non-cancer ) would detect maximum level difference anti-Xa activity plasma 0.20 cancer patient cancer-with power 90 % risk first kind 5 % . A difference 0.20 seem relevant preliminary data ( median 0.46 vs 0.65 ) , return show cancer patient 70 % chance maximum concentration anti-Xa activity free cancer patient ( nonparametric Wilcoxon test ) . 2 . Cohort study ( cancer patient ) The risk recurrent thromboembolism estimate 5 10 % cancer patient . By include 200 subject , around twenty event would observe corresponds reasonable number subject recruit 18 month ( 50 would already enroll pharmacodynamic study ) . The event rate assess first 100 patient follow 6 month , event rate lower expect , number participant reassess . After 2 year inclusion , event rate lower expect ( 7 % ) . The number subject require therefore reassessed . To reach number 20 event necessary analysis , total 320 cancer subject must therefore include . Target Follow-Up , duration : Study duration : 5 year 6 month ( inclusion : 5 year follow-up : 6 month ) . Duration participation : 3 10 day non-cancer patient , 6 month cancer patient . Performance study : 1 . Pharmacokinetics study Inclusion ( soon diagnosis confirm VTE ) : 1 tube blood take start treatment ( time another blood sample ) determination heparanase . After start treatment : 3 tube blood draw determination anti-Xa activity . Assays centrally perform , blind clinical data group knowledge group patient . 2 . Prospective cohort study cancer patient Followed 6 month consultation 1 , 3 , 6 month ( normal monitoring ) . Follow-up visit : Collection clinical data ( recurrent thromboembolism , hemorrhage , death , tumor progression , cancer treatment since last visit , interruption treatment LMWH , thrombocytopenia , anemia ) , removal 1 tube blood ( time another sample ) determination anti-Xa activity . Thromboembolic recurrence validate centrally independent committee . Prospects : Reduce incidence thromboembolic recurrence cancer patient treat LMWH VTE adapt dose LMWH anti-Xa activity population hypothesis verify .</detailed_description>
