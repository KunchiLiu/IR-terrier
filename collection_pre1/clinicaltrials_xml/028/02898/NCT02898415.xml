	<detailed_description>Rationale : Liver transplantation ( LT ) one curative treatment option patient HCC associate chronic liver disease ( cirrhosis ) . All current international guideline recommend LT HCC within pre-defined criterion . The use restrictive criterion select patient affect HCC LT originally propose Milan criterion . These criterion base pathologic assessment number size HCC nodule explanted liver . Subsequently , many author propose expansion restrictive criterion ( e.g . UCSF , Tumour Volume , Up-To-Seven etc. ) . All attempt , base different combination morphologic parameter , define pathologic stag tumor make remove liver , namely LT , decision treatment treatment could change . Over time , various attempt also make correlate postoperative pathologic finding HCC preoperative clinical stag order anticipate decision-making . Should reliable conversion algorithm correlate pre-operative stag post-transplant prognosis available selection LT candidate base routine radiologic HCC finding would optimise survival patient survival organ resource allocation . Although post-LT pathology / pre-LT radiology correlation improve time , significant bias still affect clinical assessment HCC stage reliable protocol enter clinical practice yet . In addition , robust evidence indicate biological marker aggressiveness ( α-FP level clinical response bridge therapy ) add evaluate pre-operative variable . Another important issue consider deal LT HCC strike progress treat chronic viral infection ( HCV HBV ) achieve last year . Due possibility treat recurrence viral infection transplant liver , condition significantly affect mortality follow LT past . In current scenario , decrease role non-oncologic factor survival patient treat LT HCC enhances need define new prognostic model orient towards cancer-specific survival . These model include , besides conventional morphological parameter , also response bridge therapy deliver pre-transplant setting well biologic marker commonly use clinical practise α-FP level . Although many study conduct , prognostic calculator cancer-specific survival HCC patient undergo evaluation LT yet available . Such model able provide survival estimate base pre-treatment oncologic variable . A tailored assessment cancer-specific prognosis strongly advocate also regulatory authority , optimize allocation/distribution criterion limit source available organ . Therefore , criterion could useful daily practise transplant Centres define different priority level within wait list LT , patient without HCC . Endpoints clinical relevance : The main goal study definition cancer-specific prognostic model base pre-operative feature ( radiologic stag α-FP level ) wide population patient underwent LT HCC . Considering competitive risk cancer-specific mortality death due cause , aim redefine Up-To-Seven criterion , develop base pathologic stag . Primary endpoint : besides conventional outcome endpoint , study aim develop validate prognostic calculator recurrence rate cancer-specific survival HCC patient undergo evaluation LT . The prognostic algorithm base competitive risk analysis cancer-related recurrence survival vs. non-cancer related outcome . Clinical relevance : development on-line available prognostic calculator base pre-operative oncologic factor would provide precise estimate survival . This could help comparison patient different disease stage comorbidities , define progressive priority level apply wait list LT . The final goal provide reliable survival estimate patient different disease stage therefore different priority . This perspective may great clinical impact would allow definition different priority level LT HCC , provide prognosis-oriented treatment patient optimise global outcome population patient eligible LT. Observational period : Retrospective analysis population patient underwent LT HCC January 2000 December 2015 . Study population size : The expected number patient Italian centre 1000 case . If training set allow development cancer-specific prognostic model , least 300 case add set external validation , preferably belong Eastern series ( see ) .</detailed_description>
