	<brief_summary>The aim project measure difference antioxidant capacity different time point consume single dose antioxidant-containing drink ( vitamin C epicatechin ) compare control drink 10 volunteer , match data propose model correspond either homeostasis accumulation . Additionally also determine whether effect change antioxidant capacity response epicatechin vitamin c equal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cross-over Double-blind Intervention Investigate Effects Defined Antioxidant-containing Drinks Time Course Antioxidant Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sample size 10 volunteer . This base estimate number datasets required ensure least datasets show time course suitable demonstration . The trial use cross-over double-blind placebo-controlled design . A participant information sheet give participant read least 24 hour prior screen . Eligibility participant check screen session . The participant anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , body fat ) take Health Questionnaire fill complete . Inclusion Criteria : Healthy adult , BMI 18.5-30 Exclusion Criteria : Any disease medication affect metabolism digestion , smoker , common cold inflammatory illness time bio-sample collection . Any physical mental condition judgement experimenter would mean participation study would undue burden volunteer . At screen session , participant inform relevant detail study . Specifically must avoid consumption fruit , vegetable whole grain product , coffee tea , beer wine 48 hour start intervention 24 hour ( however cola , 7-up similar caffeine-containing drink without real fruit herbs fine ) . After opportunity ask question regard test procedure , happy take part , free ask sign consent form . Antioxidant Intervention Session : Overall , volunteer randomise receive three treatment crossover design , one epicatechin contain drink treatment , one vitamin C another without antioxidant placebo . The volunteer avoid consumption fruit , vegetable whole grain product , coffee tea , beer wine 48 hour intervention 24 hour , intervention administer overnight fast ( 12 hour ) . At test , volunteer consume 360ml drink , either 60mg vitamin C correspond smoothie , 80 mg epicatechin correspond approx . 56g unsweetened bake chocolate ( Bhagwat , 2014 ) antioxidant ( placebo ) contain 13 % sugar ( provide 50g mixture glucose fructose ) relevant flavouring . The optimal timing sample determine use mathematical model result initial study do BBC help Professor Gunnar Cedersund ( Linköping University ) . Capillary blood sample obtain finger prick collect multivette 600 tube ( 600µl per tube ) . baseline , 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 5 , 6 , 8 24 hour post dose . Breakfast serve 1.5 2 hour consumption drink , lunch 3.5-hour sample collect .</detailed_description>
