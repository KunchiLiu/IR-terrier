	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer 5th lead cause cancer-related death Korea . It dismal prognosis low 5-year survival rate , 5 % . Only 10 % pancreatic cancer patient diagnose operable status . So , patient could treat curative resection . Locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( LAPC ) define define surgically unresectable due vascular encasement ( e.g . celiac trunk superior mesenteric artery ) tumor , evidence distant metastasis . In LAPC patient , systemic chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy use standard therapy , therapeutic response poor . Only less 30 % patient show treatment response , median survival LAPC patient 9 month . Thus , effective treatment modality need LAPC patient . Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) soft tissue ablation technique use ultra short strong electrical field create permanent hence lethal nanopores cell membrane , disrupt cellular homeostasis . IRE cause thermally induced necrosis tissue selectivity , adjacent tissue vascular structure preserve . Several clinical trial use IRE perform liver , kidney lung cancer patient . We operate IRE procedure LAPC patient previously receive standard therapy show response , use NanoKnife IRE device . We investigate treatment response safety IRE .</brief_summary>
