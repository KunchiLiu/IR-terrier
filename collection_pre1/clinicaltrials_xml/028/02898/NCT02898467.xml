	<brief_summary>Intraplaque hemorrhage drive force atherothrombotic plaque vulnerability rupture associate clinical complication . Polymorphonuclear neutrophil ( PMNs ) represent 70 % leukocyte may constitute source protease oxidants favour plaque rupture . Our objective evaluate PMN activation atherosclerotic plaque non-diabetic versus type 2 diabetic patient . For purpose , investigator quantify presence cell-free DNA , reflect formation neutrophil extracellular trap ( NETs ) carotid endarterectomy sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherothrombotic plaque type 2 diabetic patient characterize increased neovascularization associate intraplaque hemorrhage relative non-diabetic patient could account major incidence clinical complication . In parallel , Type 2 diabetic patient characterize increased intracellular oxidative stress circulate PMNs lead prim phenotype . PMN priming could trigger via receptor advance glycation endproducts . In particular , glycated albumin may activate NADPH oxidase thus promote production reactive oxygen specie . Under strong activation , PMNs describe release NETs constitute externalized nucleosomes associate DNA , histones enzyme initially present granule ( myeloperoxidase , matrix metalloproteinase 9 elastase ) . Our hypothesis diabetic condition , PMNs could activate within atherothrombotic plaque thus represent trigger plaque rupture . In present study , evaluate PMN activation carotid plaque diabetic vs non-diabetic patient well plasma sample patient . For purpose , patient undergo carotid surgery endarterectomy enrol study blood sample collect day surgery preparation plasma serum . The endarterectomy sample collect , dissect culprit area plaque ( CP ) adjacent non-complicated plaque ( NCP ) , incubate separately culture medium 24h 37°C . The result conditioned medium aliquoted stored -80°C different assessment . A representative section CP save moment dissection histological evaluation ( presence neovessels/intraplaque hemorrhage , calcification , lipid , etc ) . Markers neutrophil activation , intraplaque hemorrhage , glycation oxidative stress quantify conditioned medium plasma .</detailed_description>
