	<detailed_description>Every year , several million red cell concentrate transfuse . For , pretransfusional compatibility test perform . In France , ABO compatibility test patient 's bedside perform , rhesus compatibility yet check . However , rhesus antigen immunogenic could lead Rh incompatibility Rh disease . Rh incompatibility occur woman Rh-negative blood type expose Rh-positive blood cell . This exposure lead sensitization woman develop anti-Rh immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . This immunization one cause hemolytic disease newborn ( HDN ) . HDN result incompatibility mother 's blood fetus ' blood . It happen fetal red blood cell ( RBCs ) present antigen inherit father miss mother . Consequence incompatibility fetal RBCs destruction mother 's antibody . Antibodies could natural , like immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) anti-A anti-B ABO system , immunization . Rh incompatibility result 2 main mechanism . The first one pregnancy Rh-negative woman expose fetal Rh-positive RBCs . Rh incompatibility lead anemia ( mild severe ) ultimately utero death . The second occur Rh incompatible blood transfuse . This subject communication . The investigator previously develop biochip optical device realize automatic ABO compatibility test patient 's bedside ( reference Citation field ) . Based previously project , goal ABORDAGE project develop another biochip base selective blood capture . The ABORDAGE chip specifically capture RBCs accord presence RH1 antigen ( also know D antigen ) surface .</detailed_description>
