	<brief_title>Cardiac Contractility Modulation ( CCM ) Therapy Subjects With Medically Refractory Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study collect efficacy data randomize controlled setting , include New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II III Heart Failure population baseline ejection fraction ( EF ) 25 % 45 % . There previous evidence relate beneficial effect CCM patient baseline ejection fraction &lt; 35 % . While patient EF 35 % 45 % prospectively study original clinical study initially conduct support Conformité Européene ( CE ) Marking OPTIMIZER System , recently available data randomize study include patient show CCM safe effective group patient well . Furthermore , literature support population similar clinical characteristic , practice treat nearly medication , similar underlie mechanisms disease compare patient EF &lt; 35 % . CCM successfully use also patient EF great 35 % routine use FIX-HF-5 study . Since system CE mark since population include patient meet approved indication well population show benefit CCM ( EF 35 % -45 % ) , risk involve perform clinical investigation seem acceptable . The study design substantiate efficacy CCM heart failure patient EFs range 25 % -to-45 % ( inclusive ) . This prospective , randomize study compare CCM plus optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) ( Treatment Group ) OMT alone ( Control Group ) 24 week period . The primary endpoint shall comparison change Peak VO2 , establish objective physiological indicator exercise capacity relevant heart failure device study . To improve accuracy objectivity measurement , double assessment Peak VO2 perform primary time point . Tests perform use upright semi-supine bicycle ergometer use treadmill . In sit one option available , bicycle ergometer prefer option . Treadmill allow case bicycle available site . Each subject shall consistently test use method throughout study . The study design adaptive manner ensure proper statistical significance power primary efficacy evaluation . The study collect additional ( exploratory ) efficacy data difference treatment group control group change 24 week predict survival probability . To evaluate survival probability , two establish model use : Seattle Heart Failure Model ( SHFM ) , Meta-Analysis Global Group Chronic Heart Failure ( MAGGIC ) model . These model use information collect certain time point predict survival probability follow year . The information use prediction include status disease ( NYHA , Left Ventricular EF ( LVEF ) ) , document medical history co-morbidities , document therapy medication , standard blood test value . Additionally , hospitalization data collect medical record site and/or medical record clinics/hospitals patient may treat timeframe 12 month enrollment 24 week Study Start Date ( SSD ) .</detailed_description>
