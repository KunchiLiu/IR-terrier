	<detailed_description>Air pollutant include ozone implicate affect health outcome . In particular , high level ozone exposure show affect pulmonary function cause pulmonary inflammation . Troubling community-based work implicate high ozone level correlate increase pediatric asthma ED visit . Because adverse health effect , EPA standard safe ozone level set , currently 0.07 ppm . Still , estimate 100 million Americans live area ozone level periodically remain EPA standard . And EPA standard set base available data , remain unclear time whether naturalistic low-level ozone exposure , fluctuation 0.06-0.08 ppm throughout day , might affect health well . This group previously examine lung function inflammatory response adult expose low-level ozone , 0.06 ppm exposure 6.6 hour , undergo intermittent moderate exercise . The investigator find response low-level ozone exposure ( 0.06 ppm ) exercise , lung function decline neutrophilic airway inflammation observe . What remain unclear , whether low-level ozone alone - without exercise - cause similar health effect . To mimic exposure ozone typical summer day pollute city , investigator expose subject vary level ozone , form 0.06 ppm 0.08 ppm , rather constant 0.07ppm . The variation 0.06ppm 0.08ppm , back 0.06ppm occur hour .</detailed_description>
