	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) work image lymph node patient stage IIB-IIIC esophageal cancer . Ferumoxytol form small iron particle take cell normal lymph node may work well image patient esophageal cancer pair MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI Imaging Lymph Nodes Patients With Stage IIB-IIIC Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility administer ferumoxytol obtain ferumoxytol enhance magnetic resonance ( MR ) image patient resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer start neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy esophagectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect detailed information location ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide ( USPIO ) -MRI detect lymph node prior neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy prior esophagectomy . II . To determine sensitivity specificity ferumoxytol enhance MR image assessment pathologic lymph node involvement base pathological finding time esophagectomy . OUTLINE : Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI 24-36 hour surgery week 12 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
