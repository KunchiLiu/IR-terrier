	<brief_summary>Achieving optimal concentration cognitively demand task immense human value . Despite understanding important role attention , work memory , fluid intelligence play professional success , huge individual difference construct , modulation cognitive domains rigorously study . From widespread use caffeine , questionable increase use prescription medication achieve peak attention , tremendous interest achieve cognitive performance drive individual experiment , often prescription illegal drug . Herein , aim standardize extend study attention modulate substance , identify blend achieve safe enhancement attention work memory . Specific proposal , aim develop SPRINT , blend natural generally regard safe compound improve attention work memory normal , healthy individual . SPRINT compose caffeine ( 100 mg ) , L-theanine ( 200 mg ) , vinpocetine ( 40 mg ) , L-tyrosine ( 300 mg ) , pyridoxine ( 0.06 mg ) , cobalamin ( 20 mg ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects SPRINT , Combination Natural Ingredients , Cognition Healthy Young Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : There still great need find treatment improve cognitive function people suffer memory attention problem , well healthy , young individual . There various natural ingredient claim improve cognitive function human ( e.g. , caffeine , L-theanine , vinpocetine ) . These ingredient different mechanism action assume general effect brain function . It hypothesize combination natural ingredient may effective improve cognitive performance . In study would like test cognition-enhancing potential mixture different natural ingredient . Objective : Examine effect treatment consist different natural ingredient cognitive performance young healthy subject . These effect compare caffeine treatment , natural ingredient find improve cognition various study . Study design : This study use double-blind placebo control , cross-over design . Study population : Twenty-one healthy subject age range 18-35 year include . Intervention : The subject test three time . At test session receive one capsule ( Placebo , Caffeine , SPRINT ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome measure number recall word verbal word learn task . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The subject include study visit test site four time ( medical screening + practice session , three test session ) . Each test session last 2.5 h. In total subject spend 10 h participate . During three test session subject receive capsule contains placebo , caffeine combination different natural ingredient . These treatment well tolerate . No adverse reaction treatment expect . The subject abstain drink coffee smoking even test day . The result study reveal whether combination different natural ingredient effective coffee improve cognitive function . In light great demand find treatment beneficial old subject suffer age-related cognitive impairment , consider risk minimal considerable potential benefit .</detailed_description>
