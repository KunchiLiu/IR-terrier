	<criteria>1 . Men woman &gt; /= 18 year age 2 . Signed date write informed consent prior study related procedure 3 . Histologically confirm clinically radiologically progress unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma , per AJCC stag system 4 . Patient least one injectable tumor lesion ( ≥1cm3 ) 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 6 . Treatment naïve subject patient relapse prior local systemic anticancer therapy . Note prior adjuvant neoadjuvant melanoma therapy permit complete least 4 week prior randomization , related adverse event either return baseline stabilize . 7 . Measurable disease CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion . 8 . Recent ( less 3 month ) tumor tissue must provide patient stratification biomarker analysis . In order equally randomize , subject must classify PDL1 positive , PDL1 negative , PDL1 indeterminate . If insufficient amount tumor tissue available prior start screen phase , subject must consent allow acquisition additional tumor tissue performance biomarker analyse . 9 . Subjects wildtype BRAF . BRAFmutant include treat , develop toxicity refuse treated BRAFand/or MEKtargeted therapy frontline 10 . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 2 week prior study drug administration . 11 . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 14 day prior randomization : WBC &gt; /= 2000/μL Neutrophils &gt; /= 1500/μL Platelets &gt; /= 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; /= 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl = [ ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 ] / ( 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL ) Male CrCl = [ ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 ] / ( 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL ) AST ALT ≤3.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; liver metastasis AST ALT ≤5.0 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) . 12 . Subject Reenrollment : This study permit reenrollment subject discontinue study pretreatment failure ( ie , subject randomize / treat ) obtain agreement coordinator prior reenrolling subject . If reenrolled , subject must reconsented . 13 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum βHCG pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation treatment . Both sexually active female male ( female partner ) patient must agree use two method effective contraception , one barrier method , abstain sexual activity study least 5 month last study drug administration 14 . Patients must willing able comply visit , treatment , procedure , laboratory test , requirement schedule protocol . 15 . Patient affiliate social security regimen beneficiary 1 . Active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects brain metastasis eligible treat asymptomatic clinical evidence progression within 28 day prior first dose study drug administration . Justification allow patient CNS disease : whereas tumortargeting antibody limit access central nervous system blood brain barrier , immune target antibody generate Tcell mediate antitumor immune response I able cross blood brain barrier . Indeed , antiCTLA4 anti PD1 imAbs show ability induce tumor responses metastatic site body , include brain 2 . Ocular melanoma . Distant metastatic relapse ocular melanoma outside CNS discuss study coordinator case case basis . 3 . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy , interfere interpretation study result . 4 . Prior malignancy active within previous 3 year except locally curable cancer apparently cure , basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ prostate , cervix , breast . 5 . Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . 6 . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid , adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . 7 . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway . 8 . Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection . 9 . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . 10 . History allergy study drug component . 11 . History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . 12 . Pregnancy breastfeed 13 . Patients present coagulation abnormality and/or patient require concomitant treatment therapeutic dos anticoagulant . Prophylactic low dose anticoagulant thromboembolic event allow . Prophylactic anticoagulant shall stop 24h prior deep lesion biopsies/injections . No stop rule biopsies/injections skin subcutaneous lesion .</criteria>
