	<brief_summary>Hirschsprung disease congenital abnormality due lack migration neural crest cell myenteric submucosal plexi bowel wall . The consequence absence parasympathetic control distal bowel anal sphincter various level . The common type Hirschsprung disease alters rectosigmoid ( 80 % ) . The incidence around 1/5000 live birth . This anomaly require surgical ablation aganglionic segment . Regardless surgical complication , patient Hirschsprung disease expose risk Hirschsprung Associated EnteroColitis ( HAEC ) . This variable risk , 4-54 % , responsible major part Hirschsprung disease morbimortality . Its onset frequent first two year life decrease age . Its pathogenesis remain unclear could due intestinal homeostasis breakdown involve microbiota , intestinal barrier , immune system enteric nervous system . This breakdown mutual benefit relation due microbiota bowel anomaly know responsible Crohn 's disease onset . Some study emphasize role microbiota pathogenesis HAEC , techniques methodology small number patient limit conclusion clinical use . We hypothesize microbiota major factor HAEC onset functional bowel problem . Considering HAEC frequent first two year , think intestinal microbiota change time patient . This project innovative use high throughput sequence method analysis microbiome analysis fecal sample multicenter cohort patient various age . Multicentre transversal study . This study potential significantly modify clinical practice Hirschsprung disease patient : good care HAEC functional trouble thanks well understand microbiota , targetted antibiotic treatment HAEC , prophylactic treatment patient high risk HAEC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Characterize intestinal microbiota patient without HAEC . Secondary objective : - Look difference microbiota composition patient without HAEC ; - Study evolution age microbiota Hirschsprung disease patient ; - Study predominant taxonomic classification element group .</detailed_description>
