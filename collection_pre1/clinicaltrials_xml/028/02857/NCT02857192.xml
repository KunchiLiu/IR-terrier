	<brief_summary>Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) frequent vascularitis 50 year age The investigator recently show GCA accompany elevation Th1 Th17 response [ 1 ] . Even though quantitative deficit regulatory TL ( Treg ) show , date data concern precise phenotypic functional characteristic notably ability inhibit Th1 Th17 polarisation . The hypothesis investigator , GCA , quantitative functional deficit Treg . Recently , progress make identification Treg new marker ( CD39 ) , make possible good identify study specific function . In study phenotypic functional characteristic Treg GCA analyse . Better understanding role de Treg GCA lead better-targeted treatment patient GCA , notably via blockage cytokine inhibit differentiation and/or function Treg . The study classify interventional lot blood sample take .</brief_summary>
