	<brief_summary>Certain percent eye proliferative diabetic retinopathymay require par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) due vitreous haemorrhage , proliferative membrane , tractional retinal detachment . This study compare intravitreal injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( ranibizumab ) versus sham injection vitrectomy PDR . The main focus see pre-operative injection ranibizuman reduce peri-operative hemorrahge related complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Injection Ranibizumab Versus Sham Before Vitrectomy Patients With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eyes respond panretinal photocoagulation remain stable decade , incomplete response relapse occur certain percent diabetic patient show proliferative diabetic retinopathy . At present vitrectomy main intervention eye vitreous hemorrhage , proliferative membrane , tractional retinal detachment . And surgical procedure might complicate intraoperative bleeding . And post-operative complication might also involve . Perioperative use intraocular anti-VEGF might associate less hemorrhage related complication well visula acuity . This study compare intravitreal injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( ranibizumab ) versus sham injection one week surgery . The investigator try make sure whether pre-operative injection ranibizuman reduce reduce intra-operative bleeding , reduce frequency use endodiathermy , decrease surgical time , improve microcurculation retina , elevte best-corrected visual acuity .</detailed_description>
