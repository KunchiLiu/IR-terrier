	<brief_summary>What combination ≤ 6 clinical variable give high specificity indicate significant shoulder injury ( fracture dislocation ) set sensitivity ≥ 97 % ? Although shoulder trauma common injury , clinical decision rule determine necessity radiography trauma . With trial investigator aim develop rule reduce amount radiograph without miss significant injury . The primary objective compose set clinical diagnostic criterion predictive shoulder fracture dislocation would reduce amount radiograph without miss significant injury . A second objective determine clinical decision rule applicable triage use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creating Diagnostic Decision Rule Shoulder Injury : CASH-trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CASH ( Clavicle-AC-Joint-Sub-capital-Humerus ) trial design cross sectional interobserver study . It randomize first examiner patient determine applicability triage use use list 19 criterion determine clinical decision rule significant shoulder injury . Method/intervention After admittance ED , consecutive shoulder injury patient assess eligibility study . After informed consent give , patient randomize first observer ( ED physician triage nurse ) examine , mean assess duplo . The patient examine mean score form , contain 19 different diagnostic criterion . The criterion group : anamnesis , inspection , palpation pain/range motion ( ROM ) . After complete list , patient get full set shoulder x-ray : shoulder AP- axial-view , clavicle AP 30 ' cranio-caudal view . The trial participation patient complete point final diagnosis treatment provide ED physician accord his/her finding interpretation radiograph . For study , radiograph reassess one consultant radiologist specialize skeletal trauma .</detailed_description>
