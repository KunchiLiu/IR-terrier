	<brief_summary>The size infarct particularly important prognostic marker . It clearly establish extent infarct correlate mortality , also long-term adverse event . The evaluation infarct size acute phase disease therefore essential clinical tool adapt immediate treatment follow-up patient . It therefore crucial technique effective , precise , reproducible , easily perform acute phase quantify size infarct follow angioplasty . Myocardial scintigraphy cardiac MRI standard examination evaluation infarct size . However , exam difficult perform acute phase infarct owe difficulty monitor unstable patient limited availability apparatus . It reason investigator would like investigate rotational angiography ( RA ) , comparable scanner mode action require transfer patient perform use apparatus use diagnostic coronarography therapeutic angioplasty . RA radiological technique use system employed coronagraph , consist rotate fix C-Arm around patient acquisition series image reconstitute . The investigator propose evaluate size infarct use RA comparison cardiac MRI ( standard examination ) perform soon possible RA investigator hope demonstrate RA allow measurement infarct precisely cardiac MRI .</brief_summary>
