	<brief_summary>Behavioral lifestyle treatment obesity produce clinically significant weight loss correspond improvement disease risk severity deliver via in-person group and/or individual treatment session . Online version develop order reduce cost . These program typically include weekly weight loss lesson tailor feedback patient ' weight loss progress . However , online program often produce suboptimal outcome compare program deliver in-person due insufficient adherence prescribe behavioral strategy , lack objective method behavioral self-monitoring support adherence . One approach monitoring improve adherence involves track patient ' weight loss progress personalize nomogram ( i.e. , graph ) . The nomogram base dynamic energy balance equation depicts expect weight loss time participant adherent prescribe goal caloric intake physical activity . A complementary approach measure intervene adherence involves use mobile technology monitor eat behavior . The Bite Counter wrist-worn device similar wristwatch measure time , frequency , rate , duration eat event monitor `` wrist roll '' motion occur food bring mouth . By use mathematical model `` calibrate '' Bite Counter weight loss nomogram , may possible identify optimal number bite give patient take day order facilitate weight loss . The purpose propose study conduct small randomize controlled trial test feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy add weight loss nomogram Bite Counter establish online weight loss program . A sample 30 participant overweight/obesity randomly assign equal proportion one three 12-week weight loss program : ( ) online behavioral weight loss treatment alone ( OBWL ) , ( b ) online behavioral weight loss treatment plus provision weight loss nomogram weekly feedback tailor nomogram ( OBWL+N ) , ( c ) online behavioral weight loss treatment plus provision weight loss nomogram weekly feedback tailor nomogram provision Bite Counter use alert participant approach maximum number prescribe bite per day ( OBWL+N &amp; BC ) .</brief_summary>
