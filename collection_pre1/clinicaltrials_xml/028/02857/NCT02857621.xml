	<brief_summary>Lymphedema condition characterize excess accumulation protein rich tissue fluid interstitial space . It progressive chronic disease without appropriate management may result serious complication . In Israel , patient refer physiotherapist certify treatment lymphedema . According International Society Lymphology ( ISL ) best treatment holistic , multidiscipline approach . Amongst different method lymphedema management , use compression treatment show effective randomize control trial . The ISL recommend patient lymphedema low limb ought bandage leg multi-layer bandage daily basis period two four week . A new classification system compression bandage recommend ; pressure &lt; 20 mmHg categorize mild , 20-40 mmHg medium , 40-60 mmHg strong ≥60 mmHg strong . In patient leg edema , bandage strong pressure show effective . However , presence venous ulcer lymphatic leg , pressure 35 45 mmHg widely accept range sufficient safe compression . The use measurement instrument currently realistic method determine actual pressure achieve beneath bandage . However , neither economical feasib¬le realistic term time . Recent study show many healthcare professional use inadequate sub-bandage pressure . No study far focused therapist train lymphatic treatment . In spite correct pressure bandage importance , question whether physiotherapist succeed correctly apply leave unanswered . The main purpose study evaluate pressure apply efficiency multi-layer bandaging among physiotherapist Israel treat lymphedema . 34 physiotherapist train lymphatic treatment recruit research . Each volunteer receive questionnaire concern self-perceived competence application compression bandage . Afterwards , two practical trial hold week apart subject ask apply bandage use strong medium pressure . Using PicoPress® , pressure measure directly bandage two hour later . Our hypothesis majority therapists properly apply medium strong pressure lower limb .</brief_summary>
