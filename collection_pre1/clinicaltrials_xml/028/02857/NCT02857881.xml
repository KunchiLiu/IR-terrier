	<brief_summary>Keratoconus symmetrical , bilateral , non-inflammatory , idiopathic corneal pathology , characterize progressive corneal thin . This disease lead bomb cornea , induce strong corneal astigmatism , responsible loss visual acuity sometimes important , non-correctable lens glass . Collagen Cross-Linking ( CXL ) simple corneal de-epithelization two common surgical technics aim slow progression pathology . They consist rigidify corneal structure order stabilize deformation progression . Even though technics commonly perform , none strategy proven efficiency . The effect CXL due superficial scar reaction well effect corneal remodel induce de-epithelization phase CXL procedure , due covalent link collagen fibril , form biochemical reaction result UV-A exposition presence Riboflavine De-epithelization may equally effective treatment , compare CXL , without long term secondary effect . Its association therapeutic photokeratectomy ( PKT , surgical technic use regulate corneal surface , eliminate opacity order recuperate transparency cornea ) aim improve regularity anterior corneal surface , thus allow well epithelial attachment ( adhesion ) may allow stromal inflammatory reaction , favorable improvement corneal biomechanics . PKT reliable technic ; however yet proven efficiency treatment keratoconus . The purpose study describe effect de-epithelization associate therapeutic photokeratectomy patient evolutive keratoconus , show proportion patient lose evolutivity keratoconus , 6 month 1 year , intervention de-epithelization associate therapeutic photokeratectomy .</brief_summary>
