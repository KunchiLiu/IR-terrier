	<brief_title>Corticosteroid Reduction COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The commonly use treatment acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) 5-day treatment corticosteroid moderate-high dose . Some patient receive repeat treatment , although show corticosteroid temporary beneficial effect effect relation serious incident mortality . It find higher accumulated prednisolone dose disable patient due serious side effect , include pneumonia , dysregulated diabetes , bone fracture context osteoporosis , mental disorder adrenal insufficiency etc . However , extent side effect unknown . Recent research show presumably small subset COPD patient benefit corticosteroid therapy . This group identify biomarker `` blood-eosinophils '' already measure AECOPD patient hospitalization . This randomize , control , multi-center , non-Inferiority trial evaluate effect eosinophil guide corticosteroid therapy patient AECOPD . The aim study investigate whether accumulate dose corticosteroid treatment admission AECOPD reduce , include presumed side effect , ( still ) remain optimal treatment effect .</detailed_description>
