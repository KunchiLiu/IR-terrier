	<brief_summary>The prognosis spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( ISLA ) remain serious complication cirrhosis . Rapid diagnosis ISLA key issue improve prognosis . The determination calprotectin ascites , use diagnosis infection ascitic liquid , could allow diagnosis short time ( 30 minute ) . To date , determination calprotectin ascites evaluate properly . The investigator would thus evaluate interest determination calprotectin ascites rapid diagnosis ISLA cirrhotic patient , like , hospitalize decompensation disease . The main purpose pilot study determine optimal threshold calprotectin ascites diagnosis ISLA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calprotectin Rapid Diagnostic Infection Spontaneous Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence ascites cirrhotic patient frequent event ( half patient develop ascites 10 year evolution ) mark evolutionary turn point natural history cirrhosis ( 30 % survival 5 ) . The spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( ISLA ) lead infectious complication cirrhotic patient ( prevalence 10-30 % ) . Half ISLA already present admission patient 20 % infection totally asymptomatic . The delay processing ISLA cause heavy mortality . Even antibiotic treatment start immediately diagnosis ISLA , in-hospital mortality remain high ( 20 % ) mainly relate development severe sepsis , septic shock hepatorenal syndrome ; medium-term prognosis remain severe also survival episode ISLA 30-50 % 1 year . Therefore , survive patient first episode ISLA candidate liver transplantation . Given major prognostic implication asymptomatic nature infection , examination ascites neutrophil count ( ANC ) bacteriological culture still recommend puncture , increase support . This clinicians sensitive process simplify diagnosis ISLA make faster . The measurement calprotectin ascites could major interest rapid diagnosis ISLA . It glycoprotein 36 KDa fix calcium zinc , synthesize neutrophil ( represent 60 % soluble protein cytosol ) well monocytes macrophage low concentration . It anti-bacterial anti-fungal , immunomodulatory pro-apoptotic . Its synthesis increase case inflammation rate reflect , inflammatory bowel disease , severity inflammation bowel wall . Fecal calprotectin allow discriminate inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) functional impairment gastrointestinal tract ( irritable bowel syndrome ) symptomatic patient also seem powerful non-specific marker inflammation ( CRP , sedimentation rate , leukocytosis ) make distinction ; , biological marker allow therapeutic monitoring patient IBD . The reference technique propose laboratory assay BÜHLMANN calprotectin quantitative ELISA stool sample ascites Quantum Blue® Reader offer faster quantitative measure ( 12 minute ) . It consist sandwich immunoassay include speed could advantageously use diagnosis ISLA . However , study evaluate assay plasma calprotectin ascites cirrhotic patient . A high plasma concentration calprotectin could prognostic value alcoholic cirrhosis , high concentration calprotectin ascites decompensated cirrhosis .</detailed_description>
