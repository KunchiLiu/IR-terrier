	<detailed_description>Carcinomas salivary gland ( SGCs ) rare , ( less 1 % cancer head neck include 20 malignant histotypes ) . They occur major minor salivary gland , locally aggressive , demonstrate invasiveness lead involvement facial nerve , skin , bone surround soft tissue . The standard treatment surgical excision , follow radiotherapy select case high-grade histotypes , advance disease neck node diffusion . Loco-regional recurrence occur 16 % 85 % , manage select case surgery and/or radiotherapy , although prognosis patient remain poor . Adenoid cystic cancer ( ACC ) common SGC histotype observe metastatic subject ( 60 % ) , histotypes ( non-ACC ) mucoepidermoid cancer ( MEC ) , salivary duct gland cancer , adenocarcinoma , myoepithelial carcinoma uncommon . Distant metastasis principal cause failure , diagnose 25-55 % patient . Only 20 % patient distant metastasis alive 5 year . First-line treatment palliative chemotherapy typically associate solid data show benefit neither response rate outcome . Very recently phase II trial sorafenib carry 37 subject ( 19 ACC 18 non-ACC ) recurrent and/or metastatic SGCs . Interestingly , response rate 16 % ( 95 % CI 6,2-32,0 ) observe , 11 % ACC 22 % non-ACC case two outstanding response patient high-grade MEC . In one case metastatic lesion evolve cavitation observe antiangiogenic agent . In preclinical model , VEGF seem contribute tumor aggressiveness well distant metastatization SGCs , particular ACC MEC . Remarkably three confirm partial response , one ACC , one renal cancer one lung cancer , 36 patient observed phase I study Inlyta® . These result prompt phase II study test activity axitinib relapse and/or metastatic progressive ACC patient . Results 9 % partial responses 75 % stable disease best overall response . Inlyta® , potent VEGFR specific-inhibitor , approve FDA second line treatment renal cancer . Based preclinical clinical data , believe target VEGFR might represent rational basis test Inlyta® patient relapse and/or metastatic ACC also subject recurrent/metastatic non-ACC . Open-label , monocentric , single arm phase II study evaluate activity safety axitinib recurrent and/or metastatic tumor salivary gland . 26 patient histologically proven relapse metastatic SGC , progress within 6 month study entry enrol two year . A 2-stage Simon design apply : 15 patient enrolled step one least 1/15 response observe , 11 additional patient enrol second step . Axitinib administer orally 5 mg twice daily patient first two week . Patients tolerate axitinib adverse event axitinib-related dose increase 10 mg twice . The drug take progression disease intolerable toxicity . Tissue paraffin block primary lesion metastasis collect CRTC1-MAML2 translocation analysis MEC ; MYB-NFIB translocation analysis ACC ; androgen receptor HER2 analysis SDC adenocarcinoma NOS .</detailed_description>
