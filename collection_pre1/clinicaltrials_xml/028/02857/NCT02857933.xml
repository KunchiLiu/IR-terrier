	<detailed_description>Determining optimal frequency treatment young child cerebral palsy ( CP ) implication shape future pediatric rehabilitation . There wide variation number hour per week treatment current outpatient rehabilitation program child CP , suggest clinical uncertainty . Usual weekly therapy 1 - 2 hour per week 6 month longer commonly implemented frequency dose child CP 6 - 24 month age . However , decision frequency often make base clinical reason scheduling , principle rehabilitation , child development , evidence strongly design randomize control trial . The propose study fill gap directly compare effect 3 frequency level therapy - concentrated daily , intermediate , usual weekly child CP 6 - 24 month age initiation treatment follow patient 2 year . In prospective longitudinal study , child Cerebral Palsy ( n=75 ) , 6 - 24 month age , randomly assign one three group : daily , intermediate , weekly physical therapy . The treatment phase study design 5 month total 40 hour one-on-one therapy group . Level 1 daily therapy 2 hour therapy per day 20 straight weekday . Level 2 intermediate therapy 2 hour therapy per day 3 day per week 6.6 week . Level 3 usual weekly therapy 2 hour therapy one day per week 20 week . Researchers directly compare effect 3 frequency level therapy initiation treatment follow patient 2 year . Results provide quantitative evidence frequency-response , critical inform clinical decision-making , health policy , guideline reimbursement .</detailed_description>
