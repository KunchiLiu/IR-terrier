	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis age associate raise biochemical alteration proteins grouped name `` non-enzymatic post-translational modification `` . They often correspond irreversible binding glucose os ( glycation ) urea derivative ( carbamylation ) proteins lead formation complex compound ( post-translational modification derive product , PTMD ) accumulate tissue responsible deleterious effect . The specific role compound pathophysiology age atherosclerosis remain unknown , molecular cellular mechanism implicate . This project base hypothesis non-enzymatic post-translational modification may cause change genesis complication coronary atherosclerosis PTMD could therefore constitute relevant biomarkers specific clinical situation . To explore potential new biomarkers , investigator design study patient experience acute coronary syndrome follow year . The concentration PTMD assay 0 , 1 , 3 , 12 month , correlate clinical ( severity evolution ) paraclinical ( cutaneous autofluorescence ) data effect cardiac rehabilitation assess . This help identify new ( non-traditional ) biomarkers coronary heart disease determine implicate pathophysiological mechanism .</brief_summary>
