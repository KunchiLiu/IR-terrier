	<brief_title>A Study HMPL-523 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mature B-cell Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two stage study : dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) dose-expansion stage ( stage 2 ) . Dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) : The conventional 3+3 design ( 3 patient per dose cohort , potential add additional 3 patient cohort evaluate toxicity ) apply dose escalation maximum tolerated dosage determination . Approximately 21 36 dose limited toxicity evaluable patient enrol . The actual number patient depend dose limited toxicity situation well maximum tolerated dosage reach stage . Dosing begin 100mg daily . A cycle study treatment define 28 day continuous dose . Dose-expansion stage ( stage 2 ) : This phase evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics anti-tumor activity HMPL-523 recommend phase 2 dosage approximately 20patients relapse refractory Hematologic Malignancies . In stage , approximately 56 patient Mature B-cell Neoplasms enrol recommend phase 2 dosage start dose . The tumor type expansion stage restrict Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) , Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) , Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) Subjects receive HMPL-523 every 28-day treatment cycle disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
