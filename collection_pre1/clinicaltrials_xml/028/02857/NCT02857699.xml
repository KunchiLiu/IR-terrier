	<detailed_description>The main objective phase I dose find study identify recommend phase II dose . The primary endpoint dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) generally measure use NCI common toxicity criterion ( NCI-CTCAE ) grade scale . This scale , develop investigation cytotoxic chemotherapy administer limited number cycle include rest period , well adapt identify drug effect organ dysfunction life threaten event . However may less relevant reflect patient 's feeling regard tolerability treatment study result estimation toxicity . Moreover , targeted therapy specifically one administer orally give long period often continuous schedule . Moderate toxic side effect last long period usually consider DLT . The health relate quality life patient well patient report outcome include symptom scale addition usual NCI CTCAE scale could relevant variable detect intolerable treatment . It study prospectively date phase I trials . A prospective cohort 250 patient solid tumour include phase I clinical trial target agent enrol . Patients treat MTA mono therapy association chemotherapy target agent 4 large phase I center . Patients trial investigate chemotherapy alone include . Patients include phase I trial request fill - questionnaire health relate quality life ( EORTC PAL 15 questionnaire ) - questionnaire symptom ( MDASI ) - questionnaire symptom specific MTA baseline cycle treatment 6 week end treatment . The sponsor therapeutic phase I trial inform present research run interfere investigational protocol . Each phase I center latitude propose health-related quality life research patient include give phase I trial .</detailed_description>
