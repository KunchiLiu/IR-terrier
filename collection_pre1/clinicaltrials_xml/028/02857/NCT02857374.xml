	<brief_title>Intravital Microscopy Identifying Tumor Vessels Patients With Stage IB-IIIC Melanoma Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility intravital microscopy characterize microvasculature sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) melanoma patient require SLN biopsy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify vascular blood flow parameter flow kinetics associated sentinel lymph node vasculature define utility use commonly use fluorescent agent human intravital microscopy correlate clinical outcome ( time recurrence , survival ) , potential basis novel prognostic tool and/or microstaging technique . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship live microscopically-recorded image pathology slide term vessel density vessel diameter . OUTLINE : Patients receive indocyanine green fluorescein sodium injection intravenously ( IV ) undergo intravital microscopic observation 15-20 minute standard care sentinel node biopsy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week every 6 month 5 year every 3 month 2 year every 6 month another 2 year .</detailed_description>
