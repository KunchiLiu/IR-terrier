	<brief_summary>Malnutrition affect 70 % patient hospitalize geriatric 's unit constitute independent risk factor morbidity mortality . Malnutrition also associate increased length stay increase cost , alters quality life . Oral nutritional supplement ( ONS ) play key role prevention treatment malnutrition old people . ONS simple way offer small volume nutritional supply high density calorie protein . The clinical efficiency ONS well demonstrate whether nutritional parameter clinical outcome . However , acceptability consumption ONS frequently suboptimal : geriatrics , 50 % 65 % prescribe volumes ONS consumed . The reason multiple : anorexia , taste change , monotony … also partly patient dislike flavor , taste texture . The respect patient ' preference essential improve therapeutic observance ONS . Generally , ONS deliver patient tell preference orally dietitian . To date , study evaluate effect alternative strategy base preliminary degustation several product effective consumption ONS geriatrics . The study design prospective , randomize , control , open study test strategy old undernourished people hospitalize geriatrics require prescription ONS . This study perform among 220 old people hospitalize two department geriatrics AP-HM ( Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille ) . The main objective compare therapeutic observance ONS product deliver old people accord usual way ( preference announce orally and/or dietitian 's choice ) accord alternative strategy base preliminary degustation several product vary flavor texture always respect medical prescription . The secondary objective compare evolution nutritional status estimate routinely used clinical biological parameter , well main clinical outcome hospital stay . Lastly , nutritional status patient reevaluate clinically 3 month hospital 's discharge . The hypothesis strategy base preliminary degustation , lead informed choice , significantly improve acceptability effective consumption ONS hospital stay , also impact positively nutritional status hospital 's discharge 3 month . The validation hypothesis could allow recommend generalization preliminary degustation ONS time prescription optimize therapeutic observance undernourished old people .</brief_summary>
