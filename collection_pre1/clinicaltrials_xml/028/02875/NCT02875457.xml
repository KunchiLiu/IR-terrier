	<brief_summary>Apatinib approve second-line treatment advance gastric cancer . Several phase III clinical study non small cell lung cancer , liver cancer , colorectal cancer tumor also show apatinib less toxic side effect well patient tolerance . However , clinical application apatinib small cell lung cancer still lack evidence-based medicine . Etoposide cisplatin chemotherapy first-line treatment small-cell lung cancer . The purpose multicenter , randomize , prospective study investigate efficacy safety apatinib maintenance therapy extensive stage small cell lung cancer combine etoposide cisplatin chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
