	<detailed_description>A. BACKGROUIND Current knowledge understanding individual low extremity amputation ( ILEA ) run limited respect biomechanical performance injury risk . ILEA able run running-specific prosthesis ( RSPs ) traditional prosthesis ; however , direct comparison subject run prosthetic design exist . The reported literature examine one design often participants run velocity . Additionally , run velocity similar study , variable rarely investigate . This make comparison RSPs traditional prosthesis exceedingly difficult , drawing conclusion performance injury risk virtually impossible . Furthermore , ILEA run study date investigate muscle activity , run simulation musculoskeletal model generate . These major gap research substantially limit understanding performance injury risk ILEA run different prosthetic design . Gaining knowledge directly inform clinician administrator within Department Defense Veterans Administration system prosthesis prescription run range speed well return duty scenario . Therefore , propose study utilize motion capture , muscle activity , musculoskeletal modeling technique directly compare performance injury risk ILEA run RSPs traditional prosthesis across range speed . The investigator also capture able-bodied control group normative comparison . In , project directly attend OPORA 's goal need multiple level . B . RESEARCH STRATEGY : Subjects Twelve subject unilateral transtibial amputation recruit military , veteran , civilian population . Twelve able-bodied sex , age , height , weight-matched subject serve control group provide normative data comparison . All subject must provide informed consent prior begin portion study option discontinue study time without penalty . All subject must complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) prior begin experiment . If subject fail questionnaire ( respond `` yes '' 7 question ) , allow participate study provide documentation physician clearing participate . Experimental Procedures A randomization computer program determine order prosthetic foot condition ( RSP traditional ) ILEA subject . All subject ( Controls ILEA ) undergo 3D run analysis instrument treadmill . A motion capture system collect kinematic data ( i.e . limb position ; joint angle , velocity , acceleration ) 200 Hz reflective marker place specific body landmark . On amputated limb , shank cluster place laterally socket marker place distal tip socket define long axis residual shank segment . For RSP condition , eight additional marker place prosthesis keel . The marker acute point prosthesis define prosthetic limb `` ankle '' joint . For traditional prosthesis condition , marker place similarly intact foot . An instrumented treadmill collect ground reaction force ( GRF ) data 1000 Hz force platform imbed treadmill . Kinematic ground reaction force data combine standard inverse dynamic technique use calculate joint kinetic data ( i.e . force , moment , power , work ) use Visual3D ( C-Motion , Germantown , MD ) software . Muscle activation data collect sample frequency 2000 Hz use surface electromyography ( EMG ) six bilateral hip trunk muscle . Disposable pre-gelled silver-silver chloride ( Ag-AgCl ) electrodes placed bilateral gluteus medius , gluteus maximus , rectus femoris , biceps femoris , lumbar erector spinae , internal oblique , external oblique muscle . Maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) obtain normalization purpose use manual resistance apply standardized position . All subject ( ILEA use RSPs , ILEA use traditional prosthesis , Controls ) run six prescribed speed ( 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 m/s ) treadmill , present randomized order . ILEA subject complete speed condition wear RSP traditional prosthetic foot . As mention earlier , prosthesis order randomize , speed condition complete one prosthesis prior change second prosthesis condition . This save time maintain similar prosthetic fit speed condition . The study protocol require every subject run 6 specific speed identify . Each treadmill speed condition take approximately 30 second , time need subject stabilize gait speed collection 10 consecutive stride collect . At least 2 minute rest provide speed condition , subject take rest need . After complete treadmill trial , subject complete 3x50m dash foot condition determine maximum speed . Again , least 2 minute rest provide effort , subject take rest need . The order prosthesis use also randomize test , three dash complete consecutively prosthesis condition . To evaluate performance run , primary outcome measure evaluate include peak joint power ; concentric , eccentric total joint limb work ; average vertical Anterior Posterior ( AP ) GRFs ; vertical AP GRF impulses ; 50m dash time/speed . To evaluate injury risk run , primary outcome measure evaluate include average GRF magnitudes load rate , asymmetry GRFs joint moment , normalize EMG amplitude , lumbopelvic kinematics , peak average joint contact force stance . Data measure collect subject compare among three group ( ILEA RSPs , ILEA Traditional Prosthesis , Controls ) . No intervention offer subject follow-up ass biomedical and/or health outcomes conduct . Electromyography Signal Analysis Raw EMG data demean , band-pass ( cutoff frequency10-400 Hz ) band-stop ( cutoff frequency 59-61 Hz ) filter remove movement artifact 60 Hz electrical noise use dual-pass ( zero phase lag ) Butterworth filter . EMG data full wave rectify low pas filter create linear envelope . Peak value extract MVIC trial use normalization run trial express EMG data % Maximum Voluntary Contraction ( MVC ) . Root mean square ( RMS ) muscle 's activity calculate stance swing phase run investigate amplitude difference . Cross-correlation methodology utilized investigate relative timing trunk hip musculature . Comparisons make assess symmetry muscle activation amplitude time intact prosthetic limb side run speed prosthesis condition . Musculoskeletal Model Three musculoskeletal model develop OpenSim . For first model , investigator use generic musculoskeletal model represent non-amputee adult male , previously use assess muscle function non-amputee run . The second third model modify version non-amputee model represent person use prosthesis . The second model include traditional transtibial energy storage return prosthesis , third model include run specific prosthesis . For model , investigator remove ankle muscle residual leg , include medial lateral gastrocnemius , soleus , tibialis posterior , flexor digitorum longus , tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus . Running Simulation Generation The model scale individual subject use manual , uniform scale factor , compute inverse dynamic model base kinematic marker position develop Visual3D ( C-Motion , Inc. , Germantown , MD ) . Then , inverse kinematics solution compute Visual3D use weight least square optimization algorithm . After inverse kinematics solution compute , investigator perform Residual Reduction Algorithm . Once minor change make model kinematic trajectory generalize coordinate , investigator implement Computed Muscle Control algorithm . Once solution individual muscle excitation find use Computed Muscle Control algorithm , investigator compare experimentally-collected electromyographic data . The investigator generate run simulation run speed participant . The result simulation compare group across speed , similar experimental measure analyze study . Joint Contact Force Analysis Once run simulation develop , three-dimensional contact load hip determine joint intersegmental force compressive force muscle cross joint , similar previous analysis amputee walk . In addition , muscle force determine movement simulation use help interpret net contact load . Material Properties Anthropometrics Inertial property prosthetic component intact body segment estimate use inverse dynamic approach . Subject mass measure use force platform . Height body weight subject measure , anthropometric measurement marker position use estimate mass , center mass , moment inertia intact limb segment . Because ILEA subject miss one foot part shank , adjust body mass ( ABM ) use input anthropometric regression equation account miss body segment . For subject amputation , residual limb length circumference knee joint distal end limb measure use measure tape . Residual limb inertial property estimate frustum right circular cone . Residual limb mass estimate calculated geometric volume assume uniform 1.10 g/cm3 tissue density . For RSP condition , inertial property RSP estimate data publish PI . Subsegments within RSP keel define via reflective marker placement inertial property subsegment estimate assume segment rigid trapezoidal cuboid . For traditional prosthesis condition , inertial property prosthesis estimate accord publish literature . C.
