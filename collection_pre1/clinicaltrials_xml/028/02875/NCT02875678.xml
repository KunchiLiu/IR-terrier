	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects ABX-1431 Patients With Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single dose , randomize , placebo-controlled , two period crossover study . This study assess effect ABX-1431 gastric physiology patient functional dyspepsia , clinical evidence impair gastric accommodation meal . All patient undergo screen visit enrollment criterion . Eligible patient treat single dose ABX-1431 HCl placebo follow IGP measurement , measure high resolution manometry probe nutrient volume tolerance test . After washout period least one week , patient undergo identical procedure treatment . This study enroll 12 functional dyspepsia ( FD ) patient .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Dyspepsia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient functional dyspepsia , postprandial distress syndrome ( PDS ) subtype , define Rome III criterion . Patient evidence impair gastric accommodation . Patient 's Rome III Questionnaire result indicate intensity coexist epigastric pain and/or epigastric burning may present , less intensity evaluation postprandial fullness early satiety ( i.e . epigastric pain burn prominent symptom patient 's functional dyspepsia ) . Patient recall symptom gastrointestinal reflux past 8 week 2 episode per week heartburn regurgitation . Patient male female 18 65 year age prestudy/screening visit . Patient Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 18 ≤30 kg/m2 prestudy/screening visit . Patient judge unmanaged significant disease disorder base medical history , physical examination , vital sign measurement , laboratory safety obtain prestudy/screening , within 36 hour prior first administration study drug . Patient clinically significant abnormality ECG perform pre study/screening , prior first administration study drug . Patient willing undergo nutrient volume tolerance test . Patient age legal consent . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Patient personal history clinically significant psychiatric disorder ( include severe affective disorder , anxiety disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder , psychotic disorder druginduced psychosis ) . Patient firstdegree family history schizophrenia , severe affective disorder , severe anxiety disorder , psychosis . Patient take antidepressant include SSRIs , SNRIs , tricyclic antidepressant , atypical antidepressant medication bupropion , mirtazapine , trazodone agomelatine . Patients take type medicine anxiety also exclude . Patients discontinue antidepressant 6 month ago may enrol discretion Investigator . Patients take gabapentin pregabalin buspirone also exclude . Patient mentally legally incapacitate , significant emotional problem time pre‑study/screening visit expect potential mental incapacitation conduct study . Patient gastrointestinal surgery . Those undergone simple appendectomy 1 year prior prestudy/screening visit may participate . Patient acute gastrointestinal illness past 3 month . Patient laboratory test screen within 36 hour first administration study drug outside limit : Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 1.5 x ULN . Patient estimate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≤80 mL/min base CockcroftGault equation . An actual creatinine clearance , measure use 24hour urine collection , may use place , conjunction CockcraftGault calculation . Patients actual calculate creatinine clearance range 7279 mL/min ( i.e. , within 10 % 80 mL/min ) may enrol study discretion Investigator . Patient active prior history neurological disorder , include limited seizure disorder , epilepsy , stroke , neurological disease , cognitive impairment , head trauma prolonged loss consciousness ( &gt; 10 minute ) , migraine headache . Patient history clinically significant neoplastic disease , exception adequately treat localized situ nonmelanoma carcinoma skin ( e.g. , basal cell carcinoma ) cervix . Patient family history long QT syndrome . Patient QTc interval &gt; 450 msec ( male patient ) &gt; 470 msec ( female patient ) .</criteria>
