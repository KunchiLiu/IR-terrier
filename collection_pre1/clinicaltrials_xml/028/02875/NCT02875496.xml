	<detailed_description>Currently , reliable , bedside , non-invasive method assess connectivity change electrophysiological activity brain associate brain-related pathology , e.g. , concussion , ADHD , autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , etc . Event Related Potentials ( ERPs ) , temporal reflection neural mass electrical activity cell specific region brain occur response stimulus , may offer method , provide non-invasive portable measure brain function . The ERPs provide excellent temporal information , spatial resolution ERPs traditionally limit . However , use high-density electroencephalograph ( EEG ) recording , spatial resolution ERPs improve significantly . The paradigm current study combine neurophysiological knowledge mathematical signal processing pattern recognition method ( BNA ) temporally spatially map brain function , connectivity synchronization . The need objective measure help clinician decision-making brain-related pathology recognize . BNA new image modality develop fill gap .</detailed_description>
