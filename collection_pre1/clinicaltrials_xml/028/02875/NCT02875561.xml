	<brief_title>Ultrasonic Aspiration Versus CO2 Laser Ablation Treatment Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incidence Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( VIN ) increase among woman still lack standard care optimal treatment . Current treatment option aim treat symptom associate VIN result high recurrence rate . Due high reoccurrence rate nature current treatment , effective treatment option warrant . An effective treatment target diseased area could potentially decrease recurrence rate . Additionally , conservative treatment modality could contribute reduce risk scar , discomfort , psychosocial sexual distraught . The researcher hypothesize treatment VIN ultrasonic aspiration 60 % reduction recurrence rate 12 month compare CO2 laser aspiration . This study employ randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) design . This phase III study determine effectiveness target treatment therapy VIN ( compare ultrasonic aspiration versus CO2 laser ablation ) . Potential participant identify gynecological clinical practice follow diagnosis high grade VIN randomize ( 1:1 ) one treatment therapy . Randomization stratify multi-focal disease Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) status . Both Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator CO2 laser ablation device FDA approve device treatment vulvar dysplasia .</detailed_description>
