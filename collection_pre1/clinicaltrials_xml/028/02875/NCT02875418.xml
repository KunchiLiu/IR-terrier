	<brief_summary>Background : Identification measurement uterine contraction throughout pregnancy labor crucial well mother fetus . Prematurity one major cause adverse pregnancy outcome , clinical decision-making often rely uterine frequency record tocodynamometer , well method include sonographic cervical length , pelvic examination . Objective : To show use EUM preterm labor effective establish true preterm labor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Two Methods Contractions Monitoring Clinical Decision Making Regarding Treatment Among Pregnant Women With Preterm Contractions .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Currently , three method assess uterine activity exist . The first , tocodynamometry , base mechanical measurement abdominal wall stiffness strain gauge place externally patient 's abdomen . This method mainly display presence contraction , duration frequency contraction . Yet , fail reflect actual quantity baseline tone contraction amplitude due great variability placement gravida 's body habitus . It also unable distinguish true contraction maternal movement maternal Valsalva maneuver coughing , strain sneeze . These main reason technology know unreliable many case show high percentage false positive false negative result [ 1 ] . Another method monitoring uterine contraction internal measurement uterine pressure via Intra-Uterine Pressure Catheter ( IUPC ) . While accurate record intensity , duration frequency contraction , well uterine basal tone , two principle limitation : IUPC use rupture membrane , introduction foreign object uterine cavity may result chorioamnionitis . The third method evaluate uterine activity involve record myometrial electrical activity [ 2 ] . Initially , assess animal model mean invasive uterine EMG [ 3-6 ] , follow noninvasive EMG recording abdominal surface human [ 7-10 ] . Several study attempt correlate term preterm labor uterine EMG , limited success [ 11-17 ] . However , although traditional EMG device use 2 electrode , multichannel , noninvasive EMG device use successfully previous study , preterm term pregnancy , prove safe accurate [ 18-25 ] . Recently , reliability study publish , regard comparison tocodynamomtery , IUPC electrical uterine monitoring , use multichannel EMG , demonstrate multichannel EMG good IUPC ( 'Gold Standard ' ) multichannel EMG IUPC superior tocodynamometry record uterine activity [ 26-27 ] . Study rational Premature labor delivery herald great cost healthcare system , include admission cost , tocolytic treatment side effect neonatal treatment preterm neonate . Unfortunately , accuracy diagnose preterm labor poor , less 10 % woman present preterm labor symptom actually deliver within 7 day symptom ' onset [ 28 ] , 30 % resolve symptom 50 % deliver term [ 29 ] . Since IUPC use woman intact membrane tocodynamometry unreliable , previous report conclude multichannel EMG superior tocodynamomtery comparable IUPC , objective evaluate utility multichannel EMG woman preterm contraction .</detailed_description>
