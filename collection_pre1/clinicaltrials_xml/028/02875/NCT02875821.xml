	<brief_title>Effects Ipragliflozin Excessive Fat Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Treated With Metformin Pioglitazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pioglitazone , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARγ ) agonist increase insulin sensitivity peripheral tissue liver protect non-adipose tissue excessive lipid overload balance secretion adipocytokines . However , PPARγ key transcription factor induces differentiation adipocyte maturation stimulates induction enzymes involved lipogenesis . As result , effect pioglitazone generally accompany weight gain increase amount subcutaneous fat . Obesity would coexist fatty liver disease condition aggravate hyperglycemia diabetes . According recent study , up-regulated PPARγ expression liver report obesity hepatic steatosis implies pioglitazone might induce fatty liver disease . A novel oral antidiabetic drug , sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitor reduce renal glucose reabsorption increase renal glucose excretion thereby promote energy loss . As result , prevents weight gain fluid retention might counteract unfavorable effect pioglitazone treatment . No study conduct additional effect obesity fatty liver ipragliflozin T2DM patient treat pioglitazone metformin . In study , investigator investigate beneficial effect ipragliflozin , newly developted SGLT2 inhibitor , reduction visceral fat area degree fatty liver subject T2DM add metformin pioglitazone therapy .</detailed_description>
