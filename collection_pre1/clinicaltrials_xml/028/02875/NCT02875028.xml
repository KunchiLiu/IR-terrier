	<brief_summary>Vorapaxar recently approve protease activate receptor - 1 ( PAR-1 ) inhibitor . Platelet inhibition may also exert positive result coagulation activation may beneficially influence inflammatory response . Since vorapaxar first available substance new class platelet inhibitor effect human coagulation system inflammatory response assess well-established human endotoxemia model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vorapaxar novel platelet inhibitor inhibit PAR-1 . It first available substance new class platelet inhibitor block activation platelet via thrombin thrombin receptor activate peptide via PAR-1 . As platelet contribute coagulation activation , i.e . provide surface assembly Tenase complex , furthermore inflammatory response releasing store granula contain promotors , inflammation coagulation , want assess effect vorapaxar human endotoxemia model . Sixteen healthy volunteer include randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single center , crossover trial washout period 8 week . This wash period chosen base long elimination half-life vorapaxar prevent carry-over effect . After intake 10mg vorapaxar ( -24h ) degree platelet inhibition assess whole bood aggregometry , case insufficient platelet inhibition , subject may receive another 10mg vorapaxar . A bolus 2ng/kg bodyweight lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) infuse blood sampling perform pre-defined time-points . After washout-period respective treatment give subject .</detailed_description>
