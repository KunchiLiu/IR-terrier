	<brief_summary>This randomize control trial examine whether 12 month monitor exercise intervention improve brain health cognitively normal old adult . This trial also address several important unanswered question : ( 1 ) Are recommend public health guideline 150 minutes/week exercise sufficient improve cognitive performance ? ( 2 ) Does exercise influence brain structure and/or function ? ( 3 ) Is dose-response effect exercise variable great amount exercise bring great benefit cognitive brain health ? ( 4 ) What mechanisms exercise influence brain health ? ( 5 ) What factor attenuate magnify effect exercise brain cognitive health contribute individual variability intervention outcome ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct 12-month , multi-site , randomized dose-response exercise trial ( i.e. , brisk walk ) 639 cognitively normal adult 65-80 year age . Participants randomize ( ) moderate intensity aerobic exercise condition public health recommend dose 150 minutes/week ( N=213 ) , ( b ) moderate intensity exercise condition 225 minutes/week ( N=213 ) , ( c ) light intensity stretching-and-toning control condition 150 minute per week ( N=213 ) . Participants meet 3 days/week site-based exercise home-based activity two day week 12 month . A comprehensive state-of-the-science battery cognitive , MRI , amyloid imaging , physiological biomarkers , cardiorespiratory fitness , physical function , quality life measure assess baseline completion intervention . Specific Aims include : 1 . Cognitive Enhancement : Using comprehensive neuropsychological battery NIH Toolbox , investigator test ( ) whether 12-month moderate intensity exercise intervention improve cognitive performance old adult ( b ) whether improvement occur dose-dependent manner . Hypothesis : PA enhance cognitive performance non-uniformly great effect occur executive declarative memory function . The investigator also predict improvement follow dose-dependent trajectory 225 minutes/week PA demonstrate great improvement 150 minutes/week PA. 2 . Brain Augmentation : The investigator test ( ) whether 12-month PA intervention augments MRI marker brain health ( b ) whether change happen dose-dependent manner . Hypothesis : PA profoundly influence volume , microstructural white matter integrity , cerebral blood flow , connectivity region support declarative memory ( e.g. , hippocampus ) executive function ( e.g. , prefrontal cortex ; PFC ) . Further , investigator predict 225 minutes/week result great effect 150 minutes/week . The investigator predict change brain outcome mediate cognitive improvement Aim 1 . 3 . Biomediators : The investigator test hypothesis cardiometabolic , inflammatory , neurotrophic change mediate improvement brain cognition . Hypothesis : ( 1 ) decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine , ( 2 ) decrease central adiposity , arterial stiffness , insulin resistance , ( 3 ) increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) level statistically mediate change cognitive performance ( Aim 1 ) brain health ( Aim 2 ) , strength mediate relationship might vary function certain apriori moderating variable interest 4 . Moderators : To examine subgroup ( i.e. , individual difference ) attenuate magnify effect intervention cognitive , brain , physiological system well understand factor predict 'responders ' versus 'non-responders ' intervention . The investigator examine three category variable : ( 1 ) demographic ( e.g. , age ) ( 2 ) genetic ( e.g. , APOE ) , ( 3 ) baseline Aβ burden . Hypothesis : The favorable effect PA brain cognition great old individual great Aβ burden , genetic susceptibility accelerate cognitive decline . 5 . Exploratory Aims : The investigator explore ( ) whether baseline brain health metric predict adherence compliance 12-months PA , ( b ) utility multi-modal brain image analytical approach comprehensively understand effect PA age brain .</detailed_description>
