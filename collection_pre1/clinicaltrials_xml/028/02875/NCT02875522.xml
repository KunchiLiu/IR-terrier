	<brief_summary>The primary cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease smoking , lead inflammation lung blood vessel lead secondary problem blood vessel disease , high blood pressure heart disease . Aerobic exercise train show reduce risk heart brain disease ; however , currently unknown whether exercise training affect patient COPD . The aim study investigate eight week aerobic exercise training improve blood vessel heart function brain blood flow patient COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) treatable respiratory condition partially reversible . The primary cause COPD smoking lead airway inflammation oxidative damage lung , link development progression disease . The inflammation isolate lung patient COPD also systemic inflammation link number cardiovascular comorbidities endothelial dysfunction , cardiovascular disease stroke . Evidence demonstrate COPD patient great incidence vascular dysfunction adverse vascular remodeling , worsen disease severity . In fact , patient COPD 35 time great risk develop cardiovascular disease stroke healthy age matched individual . In healthy individual number chronic condition , aerobic exercise training well establish reduce risk cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . The benefit exercise likely improvement endothelial function , systemic inflammation , cardiac cerebral vascular function . However , whether exercise training effect chronic inflammatory condition like COPD study . The purpose study determine effectiveness 8 week aerobic exercise training program patient 's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease determine improvement endothelial function , systemic inflammation cardiac cerebral vascular function .</detailed_description>
