	<brief_summary>The study randomize control trial ( RCT ) tailor smoke cessation intervention target type 2 diabetic patient smoke ( DM intervention ) . The objective : 1. study effectiveness DM intervention achieve ( ) smoking cessation , ( b ) smoking reduction , ( c ) progress high stage readiness quit ; 2. change level HbA1c ( ) intervention group control , ( b ) quitter continue smoker ; 3. predictive factor success outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preventing multiple high-risk behavior important focus diabetes treatment . The investigator find cigarette smoking lead avoidable cause death kill 6,000 people annually , account one every five death Hong Kong . The smoking prevalence among male diabetes ( 27.0 % ) slightly high general male population ( 24.5 % ) 2006 . Smoking long know worsen prognosis diabetic patient increase risks macro- micro-vascular complication also evidence smoking increase insulin resistance , worsen diabetes control [ 5 ] may even induce disease . Smoking cessation natural choice smoking diabetic patient reduce risk morbidity mortality . Smoking addictive behavior quit difficult high chance relapse . Only small percentage smoker quit without professional help . The stage-matched smoking cessation intervention commonly use approach . Current diabetic treatment mostly focus glucose-oriented care strategy , specialize smoke cessation counsel support rarely incorporated routine practice diabetes care . This may due already tight schedule diabetic treatment health care provider often find difficult provide additional smoking cessation intervention patient . Furthermore , smoker diabetes likely pre-contemplation stage quit seem less interest health . Many smoker prepare quit may reject smoke cessation intervention , hence approach highlight relevance salience health information make personally relevant ( tailor ) address specific characteristic diabetic patient ( target ) promote cessation need . The investigator propose stage-matched smoking cessation intervention increase relevance health information respect readiness change individual addressing relationship smoke diabetic complication HbA1c level increase relevance diabetic patient . It hypothesize diabetic patient would likely make change smoke behavior , health risk diabetic complication likelihood increase HbA1c level address simultaneously . The study consist 2 phase , Phase I qualitative study focus group interview Phase II randomize control trial . In Phase I , current smoke ex-smoking patient diabetes recruited DM clinic nine hospital purposive sample focus group interview . Smoking diabetic patient recruit modify pilot survey instrument use Phase II . In Phase II , research assistant determine eligibility patient clinic follow inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) smoke least 2 cigarette daily past 30 day , ( 2 ) diagnose type 2 diabetes least 6 month diabetic condition treatment stable , ( 3 ) age 18 , ( 4 ) communicate Cantonese ; exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) sick receive intervention , ( 2 ) poor cognitive state ( People poor cognitive state refers poor cognitive function unable communicate logically ) , ( 3 ) mental illness , ( 4 ) undergo smoke cessation program , ( 5 ) unstable diabetic ( i.e . poor diabetes condition need hospitalization ) medical condition deem suitable doctor charge . After obtain write informed consent on-site , subject randomly allocate either tailor target smoke cessation intervention ( DM ) group , control group . Randomization do within clinic . For clinic , trained counselor contact consent subject administer baseline questionnaire . The subject randomly allocate either intervention group control group . Based block randomization design , investigator shall generate list computer-based random number use SASÂ® software hospital allocate consent patient intervention control group . Instead distribute random number list counsellor directly , counsellor open serially-numbered sealed-opaque envelop ensure allocation concealment . Counsellors guide patient complete baseline questionnaire open seal envelope assign patient intervention control group . The envelope contain instruction sheet specifies one two group . All participant complete measurement exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) level site . Analysis Data The qualitative data analyze use NVivo software cod . The quantitative data analyze use Statistical Package Social Science . The baseline characteristic two group compare Chi-square test . The effectiveness help smoke patient quit DM intervention Control group evaluate compare percentage participant outcome group use chi-square test intention-to-treat analysis . Independent t-tests use compare change HbA1c level intervention group control . Multiple regression multiple logistic regression use calculate adjust odds ratio quit : stage readiness reduction cigarette consumption ; change health-related lifestyle practice ; intervention control group well quitter non-quitters . For stop rule , futility test perform . It indicate cessation clinical trial soon become clear negative outcome ( Control good intervention ) equivalence treatment likely .</detailed_description>
