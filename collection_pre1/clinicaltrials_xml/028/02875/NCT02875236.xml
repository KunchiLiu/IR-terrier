	<detailed_description>Recently great interest role endothelium pathophysiology sepsis introduce . The endothelium coat `` thick '' endothelial glycocalyx protect become activated prevents capillary leakage . The glycocalyx bind approximately 1-1.5 litre plasma portion circulate blood regulates dynamic exchange intra -and extravascular space , therefore , function barrier mechano transducer . Damage glycocalyx cause major trauma , major surgery , ischemia reperfusion injury , result vascular leakage . Damage endothelium augment resuscitation crystalloids colloid well related bleeding . Thawed fresh frozen plasma may cause `` inflammatory hit '' towards glycocalyx endothelium . The degradation glycocalyx increase endothelial permeability edema formation entitle 'the endothelial leakage syndrome ' , result development hypotension , pulmonary complication , abdominal compartment syndrome , multi-organ failure death . The current strategy maintain intravascular volume patient acute critical illness focus administration crystalloids , Ringer-Acetate , natural colloid . Crystalloids , especially , know extravasate cause edema , associate hypoperfusion compromise vital organ function increase tissue pressure limit oxygen delivery , ultimately leading complication describe . Until recently , synthetic colloid prefer choice fluid patient , Scandinavian study patient severe sepsis septic shock ( 6S trial ) demonstrate increased mortality patient receive synthetic colloid , thereby , establish adverse effect strategy . Consequently , new resuscitation fluid need , preferably support intravascular volume , also support restore endothelial integrity .</detailed_description>
