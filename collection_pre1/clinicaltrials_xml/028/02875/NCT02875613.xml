	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether avelumab , investigational antibody program death-ligand ( PD-L1 ) , effect recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer . Avelumab design block interaction program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) , know immune checkpoint , PD-L1 . By block interaction , immune system may stimulate , allow effectively recognize attack cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avelumab Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , open-label , single-arm phase II trial evaluate efficacy Avelumab patient recurrent/metastatic , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -related nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Upon study entry , patient receive Avelumab 10 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1 15 28-day cycle . Treatment give disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , investigator decision patient withdrawal . Dose interruption may occur per pre-specified criterion grade 3 high toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient histologically/cytologically confirm , nonkeratinizing/undifferentiated , EBVrelated nasopharyngeal carcinoma , amenable curative intent therapy . EBV testing may complete per institutional standard . Patient must least one measurable site disease define RECIST v1.1 , determine investigator review Patient receive least one prior line systemic therapy recurrent/metastatic setting Patient willing undergo fresh tumor biopsy ( core excisional ) correlative analysis ( ie . PDL1 expression ) .The study chair may grant exception mandatory biopsy treat physician deem biopsy feasible unsafe patient , archival tissue available provide study purpose . A conversation study chair require obtain exception . Age ≥ 18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 02 . Patient adequate organ marrow function ( absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 , hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 gram/deciliter ( g/dL ) , platelet count ≥ 75,000 , total bilirubin ≤1.5 time institution 's upper limit normal , AST/SGOT ALT/SPGT ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal , albumin ≥ 2.0 g/dL , serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance ≥ 30 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) accord CockroftGault formula , local institutional standard method ) Female patient childbearing potential negative serum urine pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication Patient currently receive receive another investigational agent within 4 week prior Day 1 study . Patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior Day 1 study . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion radiate . Patient receive prior immunotherapy inhibitor PD1/PDL1 axis . Patient major surgery insufficient recovery surgicalrelated trauma wound heal within 14 day Study Day 1 . Patient prior Grade ≥ 3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive previous immunotherapy agent , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 . Patient known additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Patient know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Patient active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) .Patients vitiligo , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment within past 2 year excluded.Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Patient diagnosis immunodeficiency , receive systemic steroid therapy ( &gt; 10mg prednisone daily , steroid equivalent ) form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose avelumab . Patient known history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . Patient known history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Patient known history chronic interstitial lung disease . Patient active infection require systemic therapy . Patient history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Patient know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Patient pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial . Patient know active Hepatitis B infection ( define presence HepB sAg and/ Hep B DNA ) , active hepatitis C infection ( define presence Hep C RNA ) and/or know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . Patients HIV normal CD4 count ( ≥ 200 ) undetectable viral load exclude . Patient receive live vaccine within 30 day study Day 1 . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
