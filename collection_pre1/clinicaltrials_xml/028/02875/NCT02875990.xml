	<brief_summary>Infection Human Papillomavirus high-risk Human ( HR-HPV ) main factor risk cancer cervix . Recent study show cancer link infection HR-HPV associated immunosuppression lack T cell response Such mechanism would promote progression cancer progression . Various factor increase regulatory T cell , presence myeloid cell suppressor defect signal pathway Toll Like Receptor ( TLR ) may key role immunosuppression mechanism . At stage knowledge , good characterization local systemic immunosuppressive signing cervical cancer need . The result significant medical impact identification new prognostic marker new therapeutic target treatment patient cervical cancer . The aim research project define sign immunosuppressive cancer cervix analyze different mechanism involve immunosuppression .</brief_summary>
