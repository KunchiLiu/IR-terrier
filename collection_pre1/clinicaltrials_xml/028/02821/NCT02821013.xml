	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect patient metastatic melanoma take government approve paid-for PD-1 inhibitor intermittently , take type agent continuously . Researchers want see two way give type treatment work equally well extend life patient melanoma , .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration Anti-PD-1 Therapy Metastatic Melanoma ( STOP-GAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard usual treatment disease receive treatment class agent know PD-1 inhibitor , also names anti-PD-1 therapy , immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitor . PD-1 inhibitor turn immune system , fight cancer cell body . Clinical trial show PD-1 inhibitor ( pembrolizumab nivolumab ) shrink tumour extend life patient melanoma . To-date , PD-1 inhibitor give patient melanoma continuously ( non-stop ) , long remain beneficial , total duration 2 year . The 2 year duration chosen doctor think reasonable , adopted standard usual duration show work clinical trial . However , recent observation suggest PD-1 inhibitor may work well give short time and/or intermittent schedule . Intermittent mean take break receive drug , long , melanoma well . The investigator study interested find whether patient melanoma live long PD-1 inhibitor give continuously ( non-stop ) intermittent schedule ( take break ) . If two way give treatment show good , benefit intermittent schedule may include less clinic visit side effect , good quality life , less cost time Health Care System . However , know present .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Minimum age 18 specified Product Monograph eligible public funding . Histologically confirm melanoma unresectable / metastatic ( stage III stage IV ) . Eligible receive treatment government approve publicallyfunded PD1 inhibitor , accord guidance / indication describe Product Monograph / Provincial Formulary . Patients must evidence unresectable / metastatic disease , consider evaluable investigator follow , measurable disease mandatory . Patients brain metastasis allow , provide stable accord follow definition : Without evidence progression least four week prior randomization evidence new enlarge brain metastasis . Treated surgery without evidence progression prior randomization evidence new enlarge brain metastasis . Treated stereotactic radiosurgery without evidence progression prior randomization evidence new enlarge brain metastasis . In case , patient also 10mg prednisone equivalent . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life health utility questionnaires either English French . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline , prior randomization . Inability ( lack comprehension English French , equivalent reason cognitive issue lack competency ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Patients must randomize prior start , within 3 week initiation PD1 inhibitor treatment . For patient randomized start treatment , PD1 inhibitor start within 2 work day randomization . Patients willing stop antiPD1 therapy , randomize intermittent arm . Patients contraindication PD1 inhibitor , describe Product Monograph Provincial Formulary , and/or eligible receive antiPD1 therapy .</criteria>
