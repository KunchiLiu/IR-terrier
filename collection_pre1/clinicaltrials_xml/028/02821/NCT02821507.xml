	<brief_summary>Chondrosarcoma liposarcoma consist different subtypes wide range patient survival . Current treatment option consist wide surgical resection , however patient local recurrence metastatic disease outcome poor . New treatment option evaluate mouse model show vivo mammilian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibition prevent tumour growth . mTOR kinase present two complex thereby activate multiple pathway . Aberrant mTOR signal know involved cancer cell survival . Several clinical study patient bone soft tissue sarcoma treat mTOR inhibitor conduct show promising result . From study investigator conclude combination mTOR inhibitor cyclophosphamide show promise result chondrosarcoma . With lack treatment option unresectable metastatic chondrosarcoma myxoid liposarcoma Eurosarc consortium ( www.eurosarc.eu ) decide treat patient standardise way accord common protocol combination sirolimus cyclophosphamide use growth modulation index evaluation current clinical study protocol .</brief_summary>
