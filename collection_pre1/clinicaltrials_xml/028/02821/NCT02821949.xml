	<brief_summary>Treatment stage IV NSCLC base chemotherapy require session check clinically , biologically radiologically absence infection . This biological evaluation base CRP rate . Lots infection may occur situation could reduce three patient 's life duration . However important make early possible correct diagnosis infection . CRP rate classically high patient even without infection . In comparison CRP , Procalcitonin ( PCT ) well-known good sensibility specificity infection diagnosis never study case active cancer . The aim study evaluate Procalcitonin basal rate patient suffer NSCLC . It could simple reliable method use . So investigator decide include new patient NSCLC stage IV come first-line chemotherapy without infection sign , realize Procalcitonin dosage start treatment . This sample analyze chemical laboratory result communicate patient physician . A new clinical evaluation realize either hospital phone day 7 search sign infection . In absence infection , patient reevaluate day 14 , 21 30 . In case infection , new Procalcitonin ( CRP ) dosage perform .</brief_summary>
