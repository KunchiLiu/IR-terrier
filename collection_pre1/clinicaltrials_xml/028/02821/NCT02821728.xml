	<brief_title>Sulphate Accumulation Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study provide evidence negative correlation prostate cancer intake cruciferous vegetable broccoli . Preliminary data ongoing intervention trial carry IFR suggest dietary change directly influence metabolic profile prostate tissue . The significant result observe date sulphate accumulation within prostate . The additional sulphate likely drive synthesis 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate , universal sulphate donor , process would consume energy ATP . A significant rise level ADP phosphate also observe prostate tissue study , support potential depletion cellular ATP . Interestingly , data indicate extent ADP accumulation negatively correlated prostate cancer progression . The investigator propose undertake two arm parallel un-blinded study test hypothesis short-term intervention broccoli soup lead accumulation sulphate ADP prostate tissue . A potential increase glutathione metabolites indicate change redox status , therefore functional status , specific gene involve tumour suppression ( PTEN ) also investigate . Furthermore , investigator aim determine whether accumulation sulphate ADP specific prostate gland metabolic analysis prostate non-prostate tissue .</detailed_description>
