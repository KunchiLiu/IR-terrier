	<brief_title>A Study Test Impact Improved Chulha Respiratory Health Women Children Indian Slums</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solid fuel use cook major cause household air pollution . . Recent data India suggest use solid fuel responsible 20 % total death among child age group , 1-4 year . Women , hand , three time likely develop COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) . A particular vulnerable group slum dwell community , financial constraint poor living condition contribute use solid fuel , lack proper infrastructure force household use solid fuel indoor cook Also , slum dwell community extremely crowd open space virtually non-existent force household cook inside house , even dry-season , result even increase exposure . Noting significant health impact use solid fuel traditional cook system ( public ) health indicator , imperative find clean cooking solution urban slum dwell community . While several effort make reduce indoor air pollution India , effort focus `` enhance stave energy efficiency , reduce emission . '' Also , use strict top-down approach community responsible many unsuccessful project . The current project base principle co-creation , involve local community design produce clean cook stove ; scalable sustainable solution fully subsidize effort . The aim find impact locally design manufacture improve stove intervention level household air pollution impact associate respiratory health indicator predictor woman child . The specific objective : 1 . To test PDSA-cycles ( Plan-Do-Study-Act ) improve local design , development implementation cook stove base co-creation . 2 . To know impact improved cooking stove level household air pollution 3 . To know impact improved cooking stave respiratory health woman child ? 4 . To know monitor change behavioural environmental practice slum dweller follow introduction improve cook stove ( ICSs ) ? 5 . To know compliance towards ICS ? 6 . To know perceived barrier facilitator adoption improve cookstove slum dweller ? The study conduct two urban slum Bangalore , India : Peenya Ashrayanagar slum . The study design randomise control intervention trial . The investigator plan pilot study test stove prototype implementing large scale . This pilot study do use PDSA ( Plan-Do-Study-Act ) approach . The study comprise two phases- Phase 1 : PDSA phase Phase 2 : RCT ( Randomised Controlled Trial ) Phase 1 consist iterative process assess impact finalize model improve cook stave health household air pollution participate household test slum Bangalore . This phase take account input participant location , accordingly cook stove undergo modification . Phase 1 planned 6 month may 2-3 PDSA cycle . Following analysis Phase 1 , large longitudinal RCT conduct ( Phase 2 ) large slum similar characteristic test slum . Block randomization perform RCT establish two group : one intervention group receive new improve cook stave act control group . A field team actively recruit household , assess eligibility RCT collect baseline survey data . For Phase 1 , investigator would randomly select 20 household participate PDSA-trials . For Phase 2 , randomize sample 250 household select . At onset Phase 1 Phase 2 , baseline household survey study conduct among eligible household obtain data respiratory health indicators/predictors ( FEV1 , FVC , symptoms respiratory morbidity ) Household Air Pollution [ indoor/ambient Carbon monoxide ( CO ) , Particulate Matter ( PM2.5 ) ] sample population . It also provide socio-demographic data , possible confounders effect modifier , symptom exposure air pollutant burn eye headache . All symptom condition consider relevant participant record . Spirometry would do twice , begin ( intervention ) part baseline data , another end intervention . Data collection perform baseline survey , every 2 month introduction cook stave Phase 1 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month Phase 2 . Data entry analysis do side side . An intention-to-treat analysis conduct order ensure external validity study minimize bias . For miss observation , `` last value carry forward `` method use . Personal , household community characteristic control .</detailed_description>
