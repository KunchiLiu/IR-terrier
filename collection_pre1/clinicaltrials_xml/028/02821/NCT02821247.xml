	<brief_summary>This prospective , observational , multi-center , study . The study conduct approximately 12 ophthalmological clinic practice throughout Greece . It plan collect data treatment wet Age relate Macular Degeneration ( wAMD ) 120 patient decision treat intravitreal aflibercept injection make discretion attend physician , accord his/her medical practice . Visits perform baseline , aflibercept first injection ( different enrollment ) 12 24 month . The 12 24 month comprise data collection visit data generate period precede visit record . All required information purpose study collect use electronic Case Record Form ( eCRF ) . The web-based electronic data capture ( EDC ) application specifically design need study adhere applicable data protection regulation requirement regard electronic record . The study observation period patient enrol study time begin treatment intravitreal aflibercept injection two year discontinuation intravitreal aflibercept injection-treatment due reason include withdrawal consent patient loss follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Observational Study Assess Effectiveness Intravitreal Aflibercept Patients With Wet Macular Degeneration Greece</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale background Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) common degenerative disease macula common cause legal blindness Western world . AMD disease elderly affect 10 % individual age 65 74 year 30 % age 75 85 year . Two form AMD distinguish . The dry form benign account 90 % AMD case , 10 % case blindness due AMD . On hand wet AMD affect 10 % AMD patient . However , aggressive rapidly progress . Wet AMD ( wAMD ) account 80 % case severe visual impairment represent majority case legal blindness . Thus , wet neovascular AMD disease great impact visual acuity patient ' quality life . About 1 % population affect wAMD 65-74 year age , 5 % 75-84 year age 13 % people 85+ year . Given wAMD strongly age-dependent disease prevalence expect significantly increase western country ( include Greece ) near future . Therefore , early diagnosis proper treatment major public health concern . AMD diagnose stereoscopic biomicroscopy additional examination macula , fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , indocyanine green angiography ( ICGA ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The patient 's visual status monitor Snellen chart Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) chart , Snellen chart often use Greece . Wet AMD cause choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) whereby new abnormal blood vessel spread beneath retina . These vessel may rupture cause retinal damage . In addition , vascular leakage may cause thicken oedema retina , think contribute vision loss . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) placental growth factor ( PlGF ) play pivotal role scenario . VEGF-A PlGF member VEGF family angiogenic factor act potent mitogenic , chemotactic , vascular permeability factor endothelial cell . VEGF act via two receptor tyrosine kinases—VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2—which locate surface endothelial cell . PlGF bind VEGFR-1 , also present surface leukocyte . Excessive activation receptor VEGF-A induce pathological neovascularization excessive vascular permeability . PlGF synergize VEGF-A process , also know promote leukocyte infiltration vascular inflammation . Treatment paradigms wet AMD change tremendously since anti-VEGF treatment ( inhibition VEGF-A Isoforms ) introduce . As consequence , previous therapy approach lose significance apply rare case . The pan-anti-angiogenesis treatment ranibizumab first show significant improvement visual acuity patient suffer wAMD , thus become first-choice therapy patient . The phase III clinical trial MARINA ANCHOR show ranibizumab apply every month highly effective improve visual impairment . However , addition small risk endophthalmitis associate intravitreal injection , monthly treatment , may continue patient 's lifetime , extremely burdensome patient , caregiver , ophthalmologist healthcare system . As consequence , clinical practice monthly treatment regimen ranibizumab often alter less frequent dose interval reduce associate treatment burden , although may result notably reduce efficacy . Results observational study WAVE AURA , investigate wAMD patient treat Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) real life set western country , suggest patient treat accord continuous treatment pattern also undertreated result suboptimal treatment effect . In WAVE Study ( n=2587 ) patient receive 4.3 injection first treatment year visual acuity return baseline visual acuity end year . In AURA study ( n=420 ) , German cohort , patient receive 4.3 injection first year 2.1 injection second year . The visual acuity decline year 1 -1.4 letter decline -2.4 letter year 2 compare baseline . In AURA study ( n =365 ) , Italian cohort , patient receive 3.9 injection first year 1.4 injection second year . The visual acuity decline year 1 0 letter decline -2.9 letter year 2 compare baseline . Intravitreal aflibercept next generation anti-angiogenesis treatment also introduce new proactive every-other-month treatment regimen ( 3 monthly injection ) first year , follow individually extend treatment interval afterwards . Aflibercept fusion protein consist portion human VEGF receptor 1 2 extracellular domain fuse Fc portion human IgG1 . It purify formulated solution intravitreal use . As , aflibercept act soluble decoy receptor bind VEGF-A PlGF high affinity naturally occur VEGF receptor . Thus aflibercept competitively inhibits VEGF-A PIGF bind cognate VEGF receptor activation . Intravitreal aflibercept recently approve European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) November 2012 . The aim study collect data effectiveness intravitreal aflibercept evaluate follow-up well treatment pattern treatment naive patient wAMD routine clinical practice Greece treat intravitreal aflibercept injection . Research question objectives The main objective observational study evaluate effectiveness intravitreal aflibercept injection describe routine clinical practice monitoring treatment pattern treatment-naïve wAMD patient Greece . Primary objective The primary objective study : - To evaluate effectiveness intravitreal aflibercept injection assess change best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ; define visual acuity manifest refraction ) baseline 12-month timepoint , treatment naive patient wAMD routine clinical practice Greece . Secondary objective ( ) The secondary objective study : - To evaluate effectiveness intravitreal aflibercept injection assess change BCVA ( manifest refraction ) baseline 24-month timepoint - To evaluate effectiveness intravitreal aflibercept injection assess change visual acuity glass baseline 24-month timepoint - To assess change central retinal thickness 12 24 month - To assess proportion patient fluid 12 24 month - To assess disease activity monitoring pattern treatment pattern use routine clinical practice ( e.g . number evaluation visit , injection visit , combine visit , OCT test , visual acuity test , fundoscopy test , Fluorescein Angiography ( FA ) Indocyanine Green Angiograpy ( ICGA test ) .</detailed_description>
