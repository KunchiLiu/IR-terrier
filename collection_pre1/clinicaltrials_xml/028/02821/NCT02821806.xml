	<brief_summary>Title : Collection Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) Healthy People Expansion T Cells Adoptive Cell Therapy Background : New therapy develop use person immune system fight tumor . Some tumor study include cancer cause virus . Researchers want use healthy cell volunteer perform research study . To , collect lymphocyte leukapheresis . Objectives : To collect healthy cell volunteer research study new cancer therapy . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 old Design : Participants screen standard donor questionnaire . It ask health past medical problem . It also ask risky behavior could increase exposure virus bacteria could transmit transfusion . Participants give blood sample make sure able donate . They physical exam . A finger stick test check hemoglobin , red blood cell , level . They might give urine sample . Participants undergo apheresis . For , needle place vein arm . Their blood take one arm . A machine separate white cell red cell plasma spin process . The white cell remove direct plastic bag . The red cell plasma return needle arm . The entire procedure take 4 6 hour . Participants may donate every 21 day protocol choose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) From Healthy People Expansion T Cells Adoptive Cell Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive T cell therapy use treat patient cancer hematological malignancy . Some therapy require patient T cell expand 100-fold . - This cell expansion accomplish culture autologous T cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) collect healthy subject . This process know Rapid Expansion Protocol ( REP ) make use pool irradiated PBMCs healthy subject . Objectives : - To provide mechanism collection PBMCs healthy subject use expansion autologous T cell patient cancer . - To improve develop new method isolate PBMCs expand T cell adoptive cellular therapy . Eligibility : - Subjects must great equal 18 year old able provide inform consent - Subjects must adequate clinical parameter ( follow ) : - Afebrile ( temperature less equal 37.5 degree C ) - Systolic blood pressure less equal 180 mmHg - Diastolic blood pressure less equal 100 mmHg - Heart rate 50-100 beats/minute - Adequate bilateral antecubital venous access 2 arm apheresis procedure - Females child-bearing potential pregnant Design : - This protocol provide mechanism banking frozen PBMCs use expansion clinical T cell therapy develop new expansion procedure . - The PBMCs collect Dowling Apheresis Clinic process Cell Processing Section ( CPS ) Laboratory locate Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) , Clinical Center follow establish procedure . - After PBMCs collect process , cryopreserved . When need , thaw Cell Processing Laboratory , irradiate , pool used expansion patient T cell 2 3 week . - Up 500 subject PBMC collection enrol study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 18 year old able give consent . Adequate clinical parameter ( follow ) : Afebrile ( temperature less equal 37.5 degree C ) Systolic blood pressure less equal to180 mmHg Diastolic blood pressure less equal to100 mmHg Weight great equal 110 lb . Heart rate 50100 beats/minute Adequate bilateral antecubital venous access 2 arm apheresis procedure Females childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding . Within 30 day pheresis donation , donor must negative infectious disease workup : Antibody screen Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C ; HIV , HTLVI/II , T. cruzi ( Chagas agent ) , West Nile , syphilis ( RPR ) Within 30 day pheresis donation , donor must : Hemoglobin : Women great equal 12.5 gm/dL Men great equal 13.0 gm/dL Platelets great equal 100,000/microliter Total WBC great equal 2 K/microliter EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History medical illness estimation PI DTM physician precludes donation PBMCs . Current psychiatric diagnosis would compromise compliance donation precludes appropriate inform consent . Presence blood transmissible infectious disease clear prior PBMC donation pose unacceptable risk recipient . Active malignancy exclude donor . Any history malignancy consider case case basis accordance NIH/DTM criterion . Donor answer Yes initial screen question</criteria>
