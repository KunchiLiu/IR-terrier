	<brief_summary>The purpose study : quantify amount post-operative effusion hematoma present total knee arthroplasty pre-operatively , post-operative day # 0,1 . Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty undergo MRI operative knee follow time : - Pre-operatively - Post-operative day # 1 ( approximately 16-20 hour post op ) - Post-operative day # 2 ( approximately 36-40 hour post op ) This conduct Loma Linda radiology department per normal protocol . No special imaging procedure undertake . Subjects male female , patient Principle Investigator Co-Investigators practice . Subjects age 18-89 year age . The total participation last approximately 30 day . Subject selection approximately 10 English speaking , male female age 18 89 year age . Subjects recruit Principal Investigators Co-Investigators clinic . There advertise electronic recruiting . The study expect last 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Background rationale study : Total knee arthroplasty one successful orthopedic surgery perform United States , consistently show excellent outcome patient , low complication rate . However , complication happen , range superficial infection repeat deep infection require prosthesis exchange amputation . Another significant complication total knee arthroplasty joint stiffness . Range motion loss also extremely debilitate complication necessitate prolonged physical therapy , return operate theater manipulation even total synovectomy polyethylene exchange . Although currently know post-operative hematoma lead adverse outcome follow total knee arthroplasty , currently literature quantify average size progression intra-articular bleeding post operatively . It would reasonable assume patient develop slight hematoma post operatively . The investigator aim assess size , possible progression intra-articular hematoma follow total knee arthroplasty . OBJECTIVES : The investigator aim : Quantify amount post-operative effusion hematoma present total knee arthroplasty pre-operatively , post-operative day # 0 , 1 . Procedures involve ( Research Interventions ) Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty undergo MRI operative knee follow time : - Pre-operatively - Post-operative day # 1 ( approximately 16-20 hour post op ) - Post-operative day # 2 ( approximately 36-40 hour post op ) This conduct Loma Linda radiology department per normal protocol . No special imaging procedure undertake . No change operative technique post-operative protocol undertaken due study apart image . All image keep LLUMC PACS system . Concise review literature support rationale , objective , methodology propose study .</detailed_description>
