	<brief_summary>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) bacterial lung infection . Typical treatment use anti-TB drug last 6 month . Some people le severe TB might need take drug long . Researchers think PET/CT lung scan along estimate much TB lung might show cured 4 month treatment . Objective : To demonstrate 4 month treatment inferior 6 month treatment people less severe TB . Eligibility : People 18 65 year old TB treatable standard TB drug Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test HIV test Sputum sample : Participants ask cough sputum cup . Chest x-ray Participants start TB drug . They visit week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 6 time 18-month study . Visits include : Sputum sample Physical exam Blood test PET/CT scan 2 3 visit : Participants fast 6 hour scan . Participants get FDG , type sugar give small amount radiation , arm vein . They lie table machine take picture body . Chest x-rays 1 2 visit Participants believe likely cure 4 month randomly assign get either 6 month treatment 4 month treatment . Participants may ask join substudy use sputum sample additional blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Shortening duration treatment patient drug sensitive tuberculosis 6 4 month attempt many time clinical trial thus far failed . These failure reveal incomplete understanding factor drive need extensive treatment . Consistently , trial demonstrate 80-85 % patient successfully cure 4 month therapy , include extensive set study British Medical Research Council ( BMRC ) 1970s 1980 , Tuberculosis Research Unit ( TBRU ) treatment shorten study non-cavitary patient achieve early culture conversion , recent treatment shorten trial use fluoroquinolones like REMoxTB . The current standard care over-treat patient total 6-months avoid relapse small subset patient high risk incompletely understood reason . For decade , clinical investigator attempt establish culture conversion predictor treatment success . Despite appeal logic , real correlation culture conversion surrogate endpoint consistently disappointing . In REMoxTB trial , particular , intensive microbiological data collect reveal unambiguously clearance bacteria sputum sufficiently correlate relapse risk useful surrogate durable cure . An important subset patient , despite clear sputum TB quickly comply medication , still remain high risk relapse active disease stop treatment . Likewise patient clear sputum bacteria slowly nontheless go achieve durable cure . Intuitively make sense : bacteria surface cavity directly open airway seed sputum . Yet full story also heterogeneous lesion within individual patient respond differently treatment chemotherapy . This protocol build upon historical trial several successful small study suggest directly monitor lung pathology use [ 18F ] - FDG PET/CT highly correlate treatment outcome culture status . We prospectively identify patient low risk base baseline radiographic extent disease , refine risk score evaluate rate resolution lung pathology ( CT ) inflammation ( PET ) one month well check end-oftreatment GeneXpert MTB/RIF test sustain presence bacteria . Patients classify low risk randomize receive shorten 4- month full 6-month course therapy . If successful , trial offer badly need alternative culture status trial-level surrogate marker outcome well provide critical information preclinical early clinical effort identify new agent combination potential shorten therapy . Hypothesis : A combination radiographic characteristic baseline , rate change feature one month , marker residual bacterial load end treatment identify patient tuberculosis cure 4 month ( 16 week ) standard treatment .</detailed_description>
