	<brief_summary>Regional Anesthesia procedure numb medication inject around nerve transmit pain area involve surgery . The objective block nerve patient feel pain surgery . Regional nerve block offer many advantage traditional anesthetic technique , include faster recovery time , few side effect dramatic reduction post-surgical pain . The use regional anesthesia breast reconstructive surgery , latissimus dorsi flap , lead major improvement patient care . Today , common regional anesthetic use latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction intercostal nerve block , numb medication inject around nerve supply chest wall . While intercostal nerve block use successfully breast surgery , provide complete nerve block chest wall , nerve unaccounted block contribute patient pain surgery . The mixed pectoral one / serratus plane block ( PECI/SPB ) block another regional nerve block successfully use anesthesiologists The Ottawa Hospital offer complete pain blockade intercostal nerve block , include nerve supply breast . In addition , intercostal nerve block so-called `` blind-technique '' compare PECI/SPB block , accurately guide ultrasound . Blind technique associate high failure rate . Both intercostal nerve block PECI/SPB nerve block use successfully Ottawa Hospital . In study , investigator propose prospective , double blind , randomize control , head head comparison PECI/SPB intercostal nerve block determine block associate best pain blockade patient satisfaction lattissimus dorsi flap surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PECI/SPB v Intercostal Nerve Block Management Postoperative Pain Latissimus Dorsi Flap Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent literature unequivocally demonstrate postoperative pain remain under-treated hospital . While breast surgery remain one common surgery perform hospital today , show 40 % woman still experience meaningful pain postoperatively . It well know poor pain control associate slow recovery , long admission hospital poor patient satisfaction also lead development chronic post surgical pain . In recent year , regional nerve block emerge promise adjunct standard postoperative analgesic ladder protocol . The main advantage regional anesthesia reduction postoperative pain limit amount oral intravenous narcotic use . The reduction postoperative narcotic use advantageous patient caregiver alike reduce common side effect associate medication , drowsiness , nausea , vomit , upset stomach dizziness . Regional anesthesia breast reconstruction surgery commonly include thoracic epidural , intercostal nerve block paravertebal nerve block . To date , remain standard care perioperative pain management usually leave discretion surgeon anesthesiologist involve decide pain blockade preferable case case basis . While paravertebral intercostal nerve block show promising result , provide complete sensory block anterior chest wall , innervation supply thoracic spinal nerve also via medial lateral pectoral nerve brachial plexus . The pectoral nerve block novel interfascial block place plane pectoralis major minor muscle particularly useful reconstructive breast surgery involve subpectoral prosthesis . It associate minimal analgesia postoperatively think particularly useful daycare set . To best knowledge investigator , utility pectoral nerve block pedicled Latissimus Dorsi breast reconstruction investigate . A mixed PEC I/ Serratus Plane Block provide analgesia lateral medial pectoral nerve , lateral anterior branch T2-T4 spinal nerve , long thoracic nerve thoracodorsal nerve , theoretically offer comprehensive block midaxillary intercostal block additional morbidity patient . Furthermore , intercostal nerve block blind technique may associate high failure rate compare precise , ultrasound guide , PECI/SPB block . In study , investigator plan systematically investigate two block latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction order document optimal postoperative pain management .</detailed_description>
