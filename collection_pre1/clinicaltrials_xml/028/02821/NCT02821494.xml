	<brief_summary>A phase I study establish high safe dose induces HPV16 E6-specific T-cell response , use highly promise novel therapeutic vaccine concept name : Hespecta ( HPV E Six Peptide Conjugated To Amplivant® ) induce HPV16 E6-specific T-cell response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hespecta Vaccination HPV+ Tumors Malignant Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) find associate several type premalignant lesion cancer . HPV16 far common HPV type detect tumor premalignant lesion . HPV16 encode two tumor-specific oncoproteins E6 E7 . In human virus clear . However , individual , infection result uncontrolled persistent HPV16 infection due expression viral oncoproteins E6 E7 may lead formation malignancy . Moreover , oncoproteins maintain malignant state transform cell . The virus-specific interferon-γ ( IFNγ ) -producing cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) helper T cell ( Th1 cell ) cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTL ) able recognize peptide process highly immunogenic E6 play critical role elimination and/or control virus . Studies patient HPV associate tumor show spontaneous HPV-specific T-cell response , weak fail sufficiently control tumor outgrowth . Preexisting specific T-cell response E6 E7 patient HPV related tumor associate well outcome treatment . Since HPV16-transformed tumor cell constitutively express two HPV16 encode E6 E7 oncoproteins , viral antigen consider excellent target immunotherapeutic vaccine strategy aim reinforce tumor-specific T-cell response . Previous vaccination study show use first generation HPV16 synthetic long peptide vaccine ( HPV16-SLP ) safe highly immunogenic patient HPV-induced ano-genital lesion . Vaccination patient cervical cancer ( CxCa ) also result induction HPV16-specific T-cell response nature strength induce T cell response sufficient regression tumor . Specifically , conclude polarization T cell response Th1 ( IFNγ-response ) optimal much strong CD8+ T cell response require clinical efficacy . These result initiate development new HPV16 vaccination strategy able polarize induce Th1 response obtain strong CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity . One development consist conjugate two HPV16 E6 SLP Amplivant® synthetic Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 2 ligand . These two peptide cover immunodominant region overlap HPV16-SLP set contain Th CTL epitopes . Peptide conjugate Amplivant® select acknowledged capacity strongly enhance antigen presentation dendritic cell ( DCs ) , enhance T-cell priming cause superior induction effective anti-tumor CTL response mouse tumor model , compare mixture free TLR ligand peptide . In preclinical murine study , Amplivant®-conjugated SLP show 10 100 time high bioactivity compare unconjugated SLP , term induce immune response . In addition , quantity quality human T-cell response , especially HPV16-specific CD8+ T-cell response , cancer patient could markedly enhance ex vivo stimulation Amplivant®-conjugated SLPs .</detailed_description>
