	<brief_title>A Bioavailability Crossover Study Two Formulations Lamotrigine Extended Release Tablets Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , randomize , open-label , single dose , two treatment , four-period , two-sequence , fully replicate crossover design feed state . The study include two treatment : - Treatment-A : One dose Lamotrigine extended-release tablet ( Test ) administer morning 10-hour overnight fast 30 minute start high-fat , high-calorie breakfast . - Treatment-B : One dose Lamictal XR extended-release tablet ( Reference ) administer morning 10 hour overnight fast 30 minute start high-fat , high-calorie breakfast . A total 30 healthy subject dosed ensure least 24 subject complete 4-period replicate design . For treatment period , subject confine day prior dose approximately 48 hour post-dose . Subjects return clinical site remain blood sample . There minimum 14-day washout dos . Subject participation Screening Visit Follow-Up Visit approximately 71 day .</detailed_description>
