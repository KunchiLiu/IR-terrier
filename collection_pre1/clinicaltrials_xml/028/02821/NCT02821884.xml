	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) show improve motor function also increase cortical excitability neural plasticity . Several study demonstrate combination tDCS different treatment effective single tDCS alone . However , effect combination tDCS neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) upper extremity motor recovery patient stroke yet investigate . Taking consideration safety feasibility new medical technology , recruitment healthy subject pilot study . And recruit stroke patient investigate effect combination tDCS NMES upper extremity motor recovery stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) non-invasive electrical stimulation , study prove efficacy tDCS NMES healthy subject stroke patient . However , effect combination tDCS NMES upper extremity motor recovery neural plasticity healthy subject patient stroke yet investigate . Moreover order discover tDCS combine NMES safety feasibility influence neural plasticity motor function , cortical excitability functional recovery measurement ( clinical scale ) take healthy subject stroke . The right-handed subject receive combination tDCS NMES 30 minute . The change hand function cortical excitability probe record movement performance scale upper extremity mapping brain cortex intervention . The patient assign one three group ( A , B , C ) block randomization . All participant receive regular traditional rehabilitation . In addition , three group receive additional 3 week , 5 time per week , 30 minute daily , total 15 session . Group A : tDCS NMES conduct simultaneously 30 minute . Group B : combination tDCS sham NMES Group C : combination sham tDCS sham NMES .</detailed_description>
