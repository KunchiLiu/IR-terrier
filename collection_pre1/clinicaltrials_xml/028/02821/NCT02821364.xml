	<brief_title>Philadelphia Immediate Transport Penetrating Trauma Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The establishment Advanced Life Support emergency medical service ( EMS ) lead increase number procedure carry field . These procedure , intravenous ( IV ) fluid administration endotracheal intubation beneficial rural setting transportation definitive care prolong . In addition , provide benefit patient traumatic brain injury . However , data field procedure carry penetrate trauma patient urban location less convince actually show procedure result bad morbidity mortality , penetrate injury define result gunshot , shotgun stab wound . In fact , study show pre-hospital intubation clearly confer survival advantage penetrate trauma patient urban location . Yet pre-hospital procedure continue perform urban Philadelphia regular basis . In recently publish study Temple University Hospital 2006-2010 , 1,615 gunshot stab wound victim high level trauma activation , 152 ( 9.8 % ) intubate field . In another study carry Temple University Hospital look critically ill penetrate trauma patient require emergency room thoracotomy , 71.8 % patient transport EMS intubate 67.0 % receive IV fluid . This demonstrate procedure carry regularity severely injured penetrate trauma patient . Patient recruitment randomization occur time distress call receive EMS dispatcher ALS crew dispatch . The dispatcher assign patient advance life support current practice immediate transport basic life support current practice base even odd dispatch number . All participate paramedic give face face training conduct trial , provide resource online refresher reminder . Compliance enrollment procedure monitor redundant mechanism include notification hospital arrival , cross reference monthly monitoring EMS report . Subjects randomize study group receive basic life support ( BLS ) level care . This mean pre-hospital procedure endotracheal intubation intravenous fluid administration carry . However , passive oxygen needle thoracostomy , require tension pneumothorax , permit medically necessary . For patient control group , ALS responders perform advanced life support current practice , include intravenous fluid administration endotracheal intubation deem appropriate .</detailed_description>
