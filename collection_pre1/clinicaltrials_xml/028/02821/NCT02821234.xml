	<brief_summary>One-tenth population suffers insomnia , increase risk health problem depression . Self-reported sleep quality historically lead insomnia diagnosis , recently state 24-hour hyperarousal associate insomnia , either physiological ( increased heart rate , high frequency EEG ) predominant cognitive-emotional hyperarousal ( worry , rumination , repetitive thought ) . Strong evidence show suffer insomnia physiological hyperarousal high risk short long term severe health problem inflammation hypertension group without physiological hyperarousal . The neurophysiological basis insomnia phenotypes however barely investigate , although result major consequence limit condition treat . To support development differential diagnosis insomnia , structural functional brain connectivity insomnia patient different level hyperarousal investigate related sleep variable . Investigators compare insomnia group normal sleep control group . Investigators expect emotion processing circuit ( amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex ) ) affect insomniacs compare normal sleeping control b ) directionality effect depend level type hyperarousal insomniac . Further , investigator expect c ) amygdala activity positive correlate physiological hyperarousal level ) prefrontal activity positively correlate cognitive-emotional hyperarousal level . Investigators expect high physiological hyperarousal level reflect affected afferent pathway amygdala towards ventromedial prefrontal cortex investigator expect high cognitive-emotional hyperarousal relate affected efferent pathway ventromedial prefrontal cortex amygdala . Investigators expect sleep quality play mediate role type hyperarousal brain activation pattern insomnia patient normal sleeping control . These data lead definition new insomnia phenotypes new customized effective insomnia treatment , focus improve sleep also change dysfunctional hyperarousal level currently put insomniacs risk numerous severe health problem .</brief_summary>
