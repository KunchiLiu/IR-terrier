	<brief_title>Orkambi Exercise Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances therapy patient care lead dramatic improvement cystic fibrosis ( CF ) survival . Consequently , CF patient live longer vary degree lung function impairment . Dyspnea commonly report symptom CF adversely impact quality life . Recently , lumacaftor/ivacaftor ( Orkambi ) , combination drug therapy , approve Health Canada use CF patient . The purpose study determine various factor cause shortness breath ( dyspnea ) patient CF determine treatment Orkambi manipulate factor improve shortness breath exercise capacity . The investigator hypothesize lumacaftor/ivacaftor reduce dyspnea intensity rating improve exercise capacity . These improvement associate improvement ventilatory response exercise . Exercise capacity important outcome parameter CF strong predictor disease prognosis include survival . While previous study report improved respiratory symptom CF patient take Orkambi , remain uncertain whether translates improvement exercise performance . Furthermore , improvement lung function parameter observe study evaluate Orkambi CF modest compare ivacaftor CF therefore stress respiratory system physiologic limit exercise might provide sensitive outcome measure evaluate response Orkambi treatment option . The objective study perform detail cardiopulmonary exercise test initiation lumacaftor/ivacaftor evaluate effect exertional dyspnea exercise capacity , evaluate potential physiological mechanism improvement patient CF . Experimental Overview : Participants CF report laboratory four separate visit . Visit 1 2 occur participant go drug ( Orkambi ) separate minimum 2 day visit . Visit 3 4 occur 1 month 3 month initiate full dose drug , respectively . On visit 1 , participant complete medical history screening , anthropometric measurement , pulmonary function assessment , symptom limit incremental cycle exercise test determine peak incremental work rate . On visit 2 , participant complete chronic activity-related dyspnea , quality life , physical activity questionnaire , perform pulmonary function test follow constant-load cycle exercise test 80 % peak incremental work rate . Visits 3 4 include chronic activity-related dyspnea , quality life , physical activity questionnaire , pulmonary function test , constant-load cycle exercise test 80 % peak incremental work rate . Detailed physiological sensory measurement obtain exercise test session . Data constant-load cycle exercise test perform visit 2 , 3 , 4 address hypothesis . Exercise Protocol : All exercise test occur Cardiopulmonary Exercise Physiology Laboratory ( CPEP lab ) . The CPEP lab locate 4th floor Burrard Building St. Paul 's Hospital ( Vancouver , BC ) . A symptom-limited incremental exercise test perform visit 1 use electronically brake cycle ergometer ( Ergoslect 200P ; Ergoline GmbH , Bitz , Germany ) accord recommend guideline . The test consist steady-state rest 6 minute , 1 minute warm-up unloaded pedaling , 15 watt stepwise increase work rate every 2 minute symptom-limitation . Constant-load exercise test visit 2 , 3 , 4 include rest warm-up period follow immediate increase work rate 80 % maximal work ( determined visit 1 ) symptom limitation . Pulmonary Function : Spirometry , plethysmography , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) , maximum respiratory pressure , impulse oscillometry perform study visit accord standard recommendation . A commercially available cardiopulmonary testing system use , measurement express % predict normal value . Dyspnea Evaluation : Dyspnea intensity ( define `` sensation labour difficult breathing '' ) perceive leg discomfort evaluate rest , every minute exercise , peak exercise use modify 10-point Borg scale test visit . Participants ask describe dyspnea exercise intensity rating end-exercise use follow 3 descriptor : ( 1 ) `` breathe require work effort '' ( work effort ) ; ( 2 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied inspiration ) ; ( 3 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied expiration ) . None 3 descriptor choose one time . Upon exercise cessation , participant ask verbalize main reason ( ) stop exercise ( i.e. , breathe discomfort , leg discomfort , combination breathe leg , reason ) select qualitative descriptor breathlessness use establish questionnaire . Cardio-respiratory Responses Exercise : Standard cardio-respiratory measure record breath-by-breath basis average 30-second epoch , include minute ventilation ( V ' E ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( CO2 ) , tidal volume , breathe frequency use commercially available metabolic cart . Operating volume ( i.e. , end-expiratory end-inspiratory lung volume ) derive dynamic inspiratory capacity ( IC ) manoeuvre previously describe . For safety purpose , electrocardiography monitor use 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood pressure measure use manual sphygmomanometer , arterial oxygen saturation monitor use pulse oximetry . All exercise test administer experienced exercise physiologist . All exercise test supervise either Dr. Quon , Dr. Wilcox , Dr. Goodwin another qualified physician . Exercise test terminate base establish criterion per American College Sports Medicine guideline . Computed Tomography Phenotyping : Existing chest compute tomography ( CT ) scan , obtain routine clinical practice , use descriptive exploratory purpose examine relationship extent bronchiectasis vs. mucus plug vs. air trap ( base CF-specific CT score ) physiological sensory response exercise patient CF . Clinical Data Collection : The follow clinical data ( collect part routine clinical care ) obtain via chart review : Medication review ( Visit 1 ) , Co-morbidities ( Visit 1 ) , Respiratory microbiology ( Visit 1 ) , Sweat Chloride ( Visits 1 , 3 4 ) . Study Participants : The study include 16 participant total . Participants satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion recruit University British Columbia Adult CF Clinic locate 8th floor Providence Building within Division Respiratory Medicine St. Paul 's Hospital . Statistical Analysis : Data present mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specify . Within-group comparison exercise responses constant-load exercise test perform use pair t-tests Bonferroni correction appropriate , compare exercise response constant-load exercise test perform ( visit 2 ) ( visit 3 4 ) initiate full dose Orkambi . Within-group comparison exertional dyspnea base Borg dyspnea rating take iso-time , defined maximum time achieve constant-load exercise test perform visit 2 , 3 , 4 . An additional analysis include adjustment potential covariates include age , sex , baseline lung function ( FVC DLCO ) . Pearson correlation coefficient use examine association measure variable ( e.g . breathing pattern , ventilatory response , operate lung volume , pulmonary function variable , etc . ) change Borg rating endurance time . Reasons stop exercise qualitative descriptor dyspnea analyzed frequency statistic compare constant -load exercise test perform visit 2 , 3 , 4 use McNemar 's test iso-time . A P-value le 0.05 regard statistically significant . Statistical analysis data perform use Stata v11.2 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) . Sample Size Power Calculation : A sample size 16 per group provide 80 % power detect 1 Borg unit difference group dyspnea intensity standardize work rate incremental cycle exercise , base standard deviation 1 unit , α=0.05 2-tailed test significance . This sample size also adequate detect statistically significant difference outcomes ( operate lung volume ) base previous study human .</detailed_description>
