	<brief_summary>Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarct ( CADASIL ) lethal disease cause gene mutation affect artery brain . Symptoms include migraine , stroke , memory loss , dementia . There treatment . Researchers want study people CADASIL learn . Objectives : To learn CADASIL study people . Eligibility : People age 18-100 diagnosed CADASIL past 5 year make decision Design : Participants screen another NIH protocol . Participants 3 visit 2 year . These may include : - Physical exam - Thinking concentration test - Blood test - Skin biopsy : A small skin punch remove arm leg - Eye exam eye image test - Fluorescein angiogram : A catheter place arm vein . Dye give catheter travel eye . - EndoPAT : A small clamp fingertip measure blood volume . - Cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) : Artery stiffness test blood pressure cuff arm leg . Soft electrodes skin measure heart signal . - Brain MRI MRA : They lie table slide tube take picture . They may get contrast agent vein . It brighten brain researcher see blood flow . - CT scan heart : They lie table slide machine take picture . - They get contrast dye inject catheter . They may get medicine make blood vessel big slows heart rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Small vessel disease condition characterize narrow small artery lead imbalance blood supply upon demand . This result progressive chronic hypoperfusion detrimental outcomes affect organ system patient . Recent advance genetic evaluation identify several genetic variant cause cerebrovascular small vessel disease . These disease common clinical presentation include recurrent stroke , progressive white matter degeneration , debilitate dementia . The link pathology defect tunica medium artery , compose mainly vascular smooth muscle cell ( vSMCs ) . CADASIL ( cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarct leukoencephalopathy ) cause mutation NOTCH3 . The disease slow onset , initial clinical manifestation third fourth decade life , progressive fatal . Predominant clinical feature include migraine aura ( atypical isolate ) , stroke , memory loss , multiple psychiatric symptom include dementia . Currently , CADASIL consider common hereditary subcortical vascular dementia , however , treatment palliative , little prospect future therapy directly address causation block progression . We propose characterize etiology natural history CADASIL subject comprehensive clinical molecular characterization . Subjects see National Institutes Health ( NIH ) year period 2 year ( total 3 visit ) .</detailed_description>
