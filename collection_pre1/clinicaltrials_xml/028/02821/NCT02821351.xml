	<detailed_description>Study Title : Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics DiamondTemp TempeRAture-Controlled Contact Sensing RF Ablation Clinical Trial Atrial Fibrillation : TRAC-AF Sponsor : Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics 2880 Lakeside Drive Suite 250 Santa Clara , CA 95054 Protocol No : DTAF-CZ01 Product : Cardiac Ablation Catheter RF Generator/Pump System Investigational Device : DiamondTemp System ( Inclusive DiamondTemp Ablation Catheter , DiamondTemp Catheter-to-RFG Cable , DiamondTemp GenConnect Cable , DiamondTemp RF Generator , DiamondTemp Irrigation Pump DiamondTemp Irrigation Tubing ) PROTOCOL SUMMARY Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics DiamondTemp TempeRAture-Controlled Contact Sensing RF Ablation Clinical Trial Atrial Fibrillation : TRAC-AF Study Objective : The primary objective study assess safety performance effectiveness DiamondTemp System treatment drug refractory , recurrent , symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) . Investigational Device : The investigational device clinical study DiamondTemp System inclusive - DiamondTemp Catheter ( UPN : CZDT100S , CZDT100L ) - DiamondTemp Catheter-to RFG Cable ( UPN : CZDC100 ) - DiamondTemp GenConnect Cable ( UPN : CZDTGC100 ) - DiamondTemp RF Generator ( UPN : CZDTG100 ) - DiamondTemp Irrigation Pump ( UPN : CZDP100 ) - DiamondTemp Irrigation Tubing Set ( UPN : CZDTS100 ) System Accessories : - Dispersive Indifferent Patch ( DIP ) electrodes - Power Cord - EGM Cable ( supply ) - St. Jude Maestro GenConnect ( supply ) The investigational device use commonly available EP Recording System , Cardiac Stimulator ST. Jude EnSite™ Velocity™ Cardiac Mapping System . There control device study . Study Design/Planned Number Subjects/Number Centers This study prospective , single center , single arm study . A maximum 50 subject enrol study include maximum 5 roll-in subject one investigational center Czech Republic . Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint event trial follow assess safety performance effectiveness DiamondTemp System treatment drug refractory , recurrent , symptomatic PAF . - Primary Safety Endpoint : The safety DiamondTemp System assess evaluate nature frequency serious adverse event ( SAE ) serious adverse device effect ( SADE ) time ablation procedure within 7 day afterwards . - Primary Effectiveness Endpoint : The effectiveness DiamondTemp System evaluate post-ablation demonstration acute procedural success define isolation clinically relevant pulmonary vein demonstration block isolation signal confirm delivery ablation treatment . Depending EP lab protocol , one method chosen . Secondary Endpoints The follow secondary endpoint evaluate support result primary endpoint : • Secondary Safety Endpoint : The chronic safety DiamondTemp System assess evaluate nature frequency adverse event ( AE ) adverse device effect ( ADE ) 30 day , 90 day , 6 month 12 month post-procedure . Study Duration The duration study expect last approximately 4 month first enrollment final report assessment endpoint . An additional 12 month study closeout last follow-up . Key Inclusion Criteria - Suitable candidate intra-cardiac mapping arrhythmia - History recurrent symptomatic PAF WITH ≥2 episode report within 365 day ( 12 ) month prior enrollment - At least 1 episode atrial fibrillation ( AF ) document Holter monitor , rhythm strip , trans-telephonic monitor ( TTM ) , 12-lead ECG prior enrollment - Refractory least one Class I-IV anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) - Eighteen ( 18 ) year age - Competent willing provide write informed consent participate study agree comply follow-up visit evaluation Key Exclusion Criteria - Previous ablation procedure leave atrium - Intracardiac thrombus , tumor abnormality precludes catheter introduction placement - Known severe cerebrovascular disease history cerebrovascular event ( within 1 month ) - Cardiac surgery within past two month . - Short life expectancy ( &lt; 1 yr. ) due illness , cancer pulmonary , hepatic , renal disease - Uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) - Unstable angina acute myocardial infarction within past three month - Bleeding , clot disorder , know thrombosis - Heart valve replacement - Mitral clip ( Evalve ) - Unable unwilling take anti-coagulants Ablation Procedure The ablation procedure consist documentation pre-ablation pulmonary vein ( PV ) potential , conduct PV isolation use DiamondTemp System , provide documentation PV entrance block . Investigator opt perform ablation non- PV focus involve atrial arrhythmia . Follow-up Schedule - Screening visit time six ( 6 ) month ablation procedure - Ablation Procedure ( Day 0 , follow-ups post ablation base date ) - Discharge ( 5-72 hour ) - 7-Day Phone Check ( 7 + 3 day ) - 1-Month Follow-up ( 30 + 5 day ) - Repeat Mapping Procedure - Repeat Ablation Procedure , necessary - 3-Month Follow-up ( 90 + 10 day ) - 6-Month Follow-up ( 180 + 30 day ) - 12-Month Follow-up ( 365 + 30 day ) - Additional Follow-up visit ( determined necessary ) The study consider complete purpose report result regard primary endpoint subject complete 7-Day follow-up . A final study closeout report create last 12-month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
