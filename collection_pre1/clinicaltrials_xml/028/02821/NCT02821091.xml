	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : Determine relationship muscle quality balance performance well association fracture fall history old adult . Muscle quality calculate information muscle strength body composition ( strength/lean muscle mass ) . The investigator compute joint torque functional activates use biomechanical data 3-D motion analysis , whereas lean skeletal muscle mass determine bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) . Clinical functional assessment balance performance also conduct . Fracture fall history prior test record retrospectively . Aim 2 : Identify relationship force usage balance perturbation old adult . Lateral forward/backward perturbation walk use elicit balance recovery response . The degree necessary joint force relate person 's functional capacity specific joint level determine torque demand capacity ratio ( DCR : task demand relative strength capacity ) . The DCR provide joint-specific unified scalar quantity represent balance recovery demand normalize maximum muscle strength capacity individual . It would indicate whether person recover balance extent his/her maximum capacity tax . Aim 3 : Examine effectiveness long-term effect novel 2-month personalized strengthen balance training program improve balance performance old adult . Personalized strengthen balance training exercise personalize base result biomechanical assessment , use Modular Interactive Tiles System ( MITS ) split-belt balance perturbation instrument treadmill . The exercise group receive training 2 time week 2 month age-matched control group maintain usual daily life activity . All assessment perform baseline , 1 week training . Follow-up telephone interview conduct 6 , 9 , 12 month follow training period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomechanics Research Effects Interactive Dynamic Balance Training Postural Gait Control Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging population become global issue . Fall prevalent concern among age adult cause fracture , injury mortality . Identifying factor related fall occur within age population essential development effective regime fall prevention . Studies show muscle quality good posture alignment critical balance control old adult . Older adult often combine muscle weakness ( sarcopenia ) , bone loss ( osteoporosis ) lead increase spine kyphosis cause vertebral fracture poor balance control . Therefore , long-term objective work prevent fall old adult improve function degenerative muscle . The propose research provide need information regard process balance control age population , potentially applied individual poor balance high risk fall . Three specific aim 3 year research project describe follow : Aim 1 : Determine relationship muscle quality balance performance well association fracture fall history old adult . Muscle quality calculate information muscle strength body composition ( strength/lean muscle mass ) . The investigator compute joint torque functional activates use biomechanical data 3-D motion analysis , whereas lean skeletal muscle mass determine bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) . Clinical functional assessment balance performance also conduct . Fracture fall history prior test record retrospectively . Aim 2 : Identify relationship force usage balance perturbation old adult . Lateral forward/backward perturbation walk use elicit balance recovery response . The degree necessary joint force relate person 's functional capacity specific joint level determine torque demand capacity ratio ( DCR : task demand relative strength capacity ) . The DCR provide joint-specific unified scalar quantity represent balance recovery demand normalize maximum muscle strength capacity individual . It would indicate whether person recover balance extent his/her maximum capacity tax . Aim 3 : Examine effectiveness long-term effect novel 2-month personalized strengthen balance training program improve balance performance old adult . Personalized strengthen balance training exercise personalize base result biomechanical assessment , use Modular Interactive Tiles System ( MITS ) split-belt balance perturbation instrument treadmill . The exercise group receive training 2 time week 2 month age-matched control group maintain usual daily life activity . All assessment perform baseline , 1 week training . Follow-up telephone interview conduct 6 , 9 , 12 month follow training period . Translational research nature contribute necessary information critical factor balance control old adult . The research also test clinical innovation exercise train improve long-term prognosis vulnerable age population group . The unique contribution propose research lie integration explicit physical examination biomechanical approach relevant clinical problem within translational model . The finding provide new paradigm treatment approach balance control reduce risk fall fracture . This research potentially applied individual poor balance high risk fall .</detailed_description>
