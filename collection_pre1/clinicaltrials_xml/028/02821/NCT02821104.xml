	<detailed_description>Cardiometabolic disease usually produce significant mortality morbidity adulthood . There clear evidence , however , diseases origin childhood adolescence . With rise incidence obesity associate poorer eat less physical activity child adolescent important investigator study disease early course investigator prevent future cardiometabolic disease . While obesity clearly increase cardiometabolic risk , obese subject increase risk ; approximately 25-30 % obese adult adolescent metabolically healthy . The complement system key physiological component control inflammation recent study indicate complement play important role increase obesity cardiometabolic risk . Adults proven cardiometabolic disease future risk cardiometabolic disease increase level complement component C3 , C3a-desArg , C4 compare healthy , risk , control subject , independent obesity . Increased C3 C3a-desArg level adolescent associate increase cardiometabolic risk independent obesity . Two specific single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) intron C3 , rs11569562 rs2250656 , A &gt; G polymorphism , associate increase serum C3 level , increase variety cardiovascular risk factor . No one investigate C3 polymorphism affect risk factor adolescent . The C4 gene significant copy number variation increase copy number associate increase C4 level . The relationship C4 gene copy number cardiometabolic risk study adults adolescent . The short-term objective study explore difference cardiometabolic risk factor overweight obese adolescent C3 polymorphism also explore C4 gene copy number variation affect risk factor . The investigator overall hypothesis variation C3 polymorphism , C4 gene copy number significant impact cardiometabolic health overweight obese adolescent . Both traditional nontraditional cardiometabolic risk marker , include measure body habitus , blood pressure , lipid , vascular function , insulin secretion sensitivity , inflammation , clot investigate 100 overweight obese adolescent . The investigator propose study help u understand role complement genetics development cardiometabolic risk potentially develop genetic biomarkers adolescent increase risk .</detailed_description>
