	<brief_summary>This phase II study patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck residual disease follow definitive therapy radiation ( without systemic therapy ) . Patients must diagnose residual disease within 24 week completion radiation therapy . Residual disease must biopsy proven patient consent trial , either lymph node neck , primary tumor site . Prior begin study therapy patient evaluate ENT determine disease amenable surgical resection . Both resectable unresectable patient eligible participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine overall response rate base immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) pembrolizumab patient residual disease follow radiation without systemic therapy squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Hypothesis : The use pembrolizumab patient residual disease follow radiation without systemic therapy lead enhance overall response rate due chemoradiation-related prim immune response .</detailed_description>

Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 follow completion RT/CRT . 5 . Have performance status 0 1 2 ECOG Performance Scale . 6 . Demonstrate adequate organ function . Labs value need assess within 14 day study treatment . 7 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 8 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 9 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 10 . Patients must history Stage IIVB SCC head neck arise oral cavity , oropharynx , nasopharynx , larynx , hypopharynx must treat definitive intent radiation ( without systemic therapy ) 11 . Patients must least 6 week ( 42 day ) 24 week ( 168 day ) completion radiation without systemic therapy time registration 12 . Patients must pathological evidence persistent lymph node disease persistent disease primary tumor site viable tumor cell confirm biopsy within 24 week study treatment evidence metastatic disease follow primary radiation without systemic therapy confirm CT scan within 4 week study treatment . 13 . Persistent lymph node disease viable tumor cell determine histological determination tumor viability . In case uncertainty follow characteristic use help support diagnosis viable tumor cell : define tumor cell intact cellular compartment ( i.e . cytoplasm nucleus ) exhibit karyolysis , pyknosis , karyorrhexis hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) stain 14 . All persistent disease must receive least 66 Gy 1.82Gy fraction radiotherapy area residual disease ( biologically equivalent dose give linear quadratic equation : biologically equivalent dose ( BED ) = nd ( 1 + d/ ( α/β ) , n number fraction , dose per fraction α/β ratio tumor 10 . Previous radiation record obtain confirm adequate dosing . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive supraphysiologic dos systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 5 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) acute , nonhematological adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier , unless otherwise approve Principal Investigator . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy , grade dysphagia , ≤ Grade 2 pain , ≤ Grade 2 weight loss , grade hyperpigmentation skin , grade fatigue , grade xerostomia , grade dysgeusia , exception criterion may qualify study . Also please note presence feed tube aid nutrition disqualify patient study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 6 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior first protocol treatment recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) acute , nonhematological adverse event due previously administer agent , unless otherwise approve Principal Investigator . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy , grade dysphagia , ≤ Grade 2 pain , ≤ Grade 2 weight loss , grade hyperpigmentation skin , grade fatigue , grade xerostomia , grade dysgeusia , exception criterion may qualify study . Also please note presence feed tube aid nutrition disqualify patient study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 8 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 10 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 11 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 12 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 13 .
