The sample size calculate WinPepi 11.20 software . Sample size estimate 100 patient , 50 intervention group ( IG ) 50 control group ( CG ) , consider difference 8 mmHg group , standard deviation 14 mmHg , 80 % power , alpha 0.05 . Adding 20 % loss sample 120 patient , 60 group . Hypertension outpatient Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) identify appointment book invite participate study telephone call .

Statistical analysis : Continuous variable express mean standard deviation median interquartile range ( 25 75 percentile ) . Categorical variable express absolute percentage number . Chi-square used association sociodemographic clinical variable score Self-Care Scale . The comparison quantitative variable group conduct Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney test , accord data 's distribution . The value systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) study , well score Self-Care Scale analyze Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) Bonferroni correction . The pressure differences group treatment analyze ANOVA test repeat measurement . Analysis Covariance conduct adjust possible difference regard basal pressure . The 5 % level significance adopt data analyze Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) v.20 ( Chicago , Illinois , USA ) .</detailed_description>
