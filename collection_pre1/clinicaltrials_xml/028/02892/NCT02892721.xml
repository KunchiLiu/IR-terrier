	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) important United Kingdom healthcare issue affect 1 20 individual , half die disease . Late presentation CRC poor prognosis , whereas excellent cure rate ( &gt; 95 % ) see present early . Accurate early diagnosis CRC therefore crucial . In patient achieve via colonoscopy , camera test widely available allows tissue sample take abnormality see procedure . However , non-invasive alternative Computed Tomography Colonography ( CTC ) use X-rays produce image large bowel interpret Radiologists . CTC high sensitivity diagnosis CRC ( comparable colonoscopy ) cancer precursor - adenomatous polyp . Unlike colonoscopy , however , accreditation process CTC infrastructure ensure report Radiologists able adequately , result , wide range diagnostic accuracy . There universally-accepted standard monitor quality ass diagnostic performance , partly know quality marker currently system quantify . Overall , contributes low cancer detection rate , miss cancer inequity patient across National Health Service ( NHS ) . This study aim assess impact structure training programme assessment feedback NHS radiologist performance . If impact positive result significantly improve performance , scheme could adopt accreditation programme CTC English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme ( BCSP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation CT Colonography Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT Colonography test detect early cancer accurately , however , unlike colonoscopy ( mammography breast cancer screen ) currently formalise program help ensure Radiologists interpret CTC accurately . Colonoscopists highly regulate , must accredit ongoing quality assurance metric , base evidence link clinical outcome . Conversely , CTC United Kingdom , accreditation process , little regulatory oversight universally-accepted metric monitor quality diagnostic performance . Radiologists interpret CTC image often inexperienced ; one-third interpreted &lt; 300 case total 20 % report &lt; 100 case per annum ( minimum recommendation ) . Futhermore , clinical practice across NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme ( NHS BCSP ) CTC may 50 % low cancer polyp detection rate colonoscopy . Missed abnormality CTC likely underpin difference , centre highly experienced radiologist ( &gt; 1000 case ) use 3-dimensional interpretation significantly high detection rate . There Quality Assurance ( QA ) framework NHS BCSP ( oversee QA Committee Radiology ) recommendation largely base opinion rather evidence radiologist report CTC , without accreditation ; fact patient representative find extremely disappointing . Prior wide-scale implementation possible accreditation programme justify financial human resource , Public Health England British Society Gastrointestinal Abdominal Radiologists mandate program scientifically proven improve Radiologist performance . Consequently , project investigate training assessment method improve diagnostic accuracy elucidate factor associate high Radiologist sensitivity .</detailed_description>
