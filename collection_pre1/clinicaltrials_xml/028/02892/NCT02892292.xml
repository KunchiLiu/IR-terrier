	<detailed_description>The number patient wait allograft hematopoietic stem cell constantly evolve . Similarly , number voluntary donor hematopoietic stem cell global file exceed threshold 22 million donor since end 2013 . Despite , search match unrelated donor HLA patient remain sometimes long difficult , especially patient rare HLA allele . It important increase number donor global file , increase HLA diversity registrant resolution HLA typing . More HLA typing donor register file accurate , research recruitment donor order achieve allograft patient wait fast . The constant evolution number HLA alleles number ambiguity quickly demonstrate limit current type technique . The study exon intron would significantly refine level resolution HLA typing , reach level allelic resolution . That level resolution would also identify null allele ( allele protein express ) . The search HLA patient make easy reduce financial impact time search . In addition , numerous study show tissue compatibility narrow possible donor recipient allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell improve patient survival reduce incidence severity disease graft host improve engraftment . In addition , analysis capability many sample use technique induce decrease HLA typing cost thus facilitate registration anonymous bone marrow donor national register Biomedicine Agency .</detailed_description>
