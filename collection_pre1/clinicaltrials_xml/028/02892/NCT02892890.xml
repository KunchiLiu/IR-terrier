	<brief_summary>Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) acquire neuropathy characterized inflammatory multifocal segmental demyelination . Due clinical heterogeneity condition lack specific marker reliably identify patient , diagnosis CIDP remain difficult . Similarly , clear factor predict evolution prognosis disease . Current treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) , corticoid plasma exchange ; IVIg therapy commonly use . Responses patient treatment variable . Thus , necessary identify predictive marker therapeutic response CIDP patient treat IVIg . Several potential biomarkers propose recently , none yet validate predictive criterion therapeutic response . It therefore necessary continue investigate several biological parameter identify reliable biological marker . In electromyography , Motor Unit Number Index ( MUNIX ) technique allow measure axonal loss precise count functional motor unit . This method , sensitive measure Compound Muscle Action Potential ( CMAP ) , rarely use CIDP . MUNIX might good tool well characterize patient follow course CIDP . It also might new sensitive reliable marker predictive therapeutic response . Magnetic resonance Imaging ( MRI ) increasingly use assessment neuromuscular disease . A recent study CIDP patient report significant decrease muscle Magnetisation Transfer Ratio ( MTR ) compare healthy subject , correlate clinical parameter . The use advance MRI technique could allow characterize structure composition muscle nerve tissue CIDP patient . It could also mean identify potential new marker , largely unexplored , might sensitive disease course and/or IVIg response . The objective study identify predictive marker treatment response CIDP patient receive IVIg . This prospective observational exploratory study cohort 30 CIDP patient treat IVIg followed-up one year .</brief_summary>
