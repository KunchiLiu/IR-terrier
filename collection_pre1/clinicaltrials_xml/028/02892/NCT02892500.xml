	<brief_title>Investigation Corticosteroid Versus Placebo Injection Patients With Syndesmotic Ligament Injury High Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term `` high ankle sprain '' refers injury syndesmotic ligament ankle . It become much common injury comprise 24.6 % ankle sprain , incidence 2.4 per 1000 athlete exposure . These present significant therapeutic challenge sport physician typically result prolonged morbidity delay return activity . The literature show lack information definitive care athlete . Typical recovery high ankle sprain almost twice long common lateral ankle inversion sprain mean time return play 45 day . There also high incidence residual chronic pain compare high ankle sprain isolated lateral ankle sprain . The current standard treatment injury depend symptomatic treatment initial phase rest protect splint . This follow use NSAID 's graduated rehabilitation program reduce swell , improve range motion , regain strength proprioception ankle . This follow protective tap brace return activity tolerate . Inflammation one body 's first reaction injury . Release damage cell tissue debris occur upon injury . These expel particle act antigens stimulate nonspecific immune response cause proliferation leukocytes . Local blood flow increase transport polymorphonuclear leukocyte , macrophage , plasma protein injured area . A redistribution arteriolar flow produce stasis hypoxia injury site . The result infiltration tissue leukocytes , plasma protein , fluid cause redness , swell , pain characteristic inflammation . Initially , inflammatory reaction serve several important purpose . The influx leukocytes facilitates process phagocytosis removal damage cell particulate matter . Pain tenderness remind patient protect injured area ; however , inflammatory reaction eventually become counterproductive . The mechanism corticosteroid action include reduction inflammatory reaction limit capillary dilatation permeability vascular structure . These compound restrict accumulation polymorphonuclear leukocytes macrophage reduce release vasoactive kinin . They also inhibit release destructive enzyme attack injury debris destroy normal tissue indiscriminately . Additionally , new research suggest corticosteroid may inhibit release arachidonic acid phospholipid , thereby reduce formation prostaglandin , contribute inflammatory process . There previous prospective , randomize study look utilization corticosteroid treatment high ankle sprain . Only anecdotal information available simple case report treatment . There one study look treatment platelet rich plasma injection demonstrate short return play time less long term residual pain .</detailed_description>
