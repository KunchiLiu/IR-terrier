	<brief_summary>Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgical reconstruction knee joint order relieve pain , restore function correct deformity . It common surgical procedure figure show 500'000 arthroplasty perform annually worldwide . Total knee arthroplasty consider one successful type joint reconstruction surgical result usually meet even exceed expectation . Much current literature focus issue relate implant wear potential failure mode artificial knee implant . It suggest knee mobile rotate bearing option , comparative device propose clinical investigation , may survive long fixed bearing knee design great contact surface area possible congruent component unconstrained , mobile component design .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , comparative , randomised , open-label , single center , multiple surgeon clinical study . The Scorpio PS Superflex Scorpio PS mobile bear implanted evaluation study . Patients randomise one two equal size group . In first group patient treat Scorpio PS Superflex , whilst second group patient treat Scorpio PS mobile bear implant . Evaluations consist KSS score , Chair rise stair climb test , radiology assessment , patient questionnaire , multiple timepoints : pre-operative , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 1 year , 2 year 5 year post-operatively .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients require cement primary total knee replacement .
