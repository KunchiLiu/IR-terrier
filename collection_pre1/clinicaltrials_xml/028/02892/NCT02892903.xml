	<brief_summary>A randomise control trial compare two strategy investigation coronary artery disease time angiography . Patients randomise conventional angiography additional , routine pressure wire assessment - measuring fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) - main vessel judge sufficient vessel calibre allow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ( experimental arm ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Management Coronary Artery Disease , Does Routine Pressure Wire Assessment - Time Coronary Angiography - Affect Management Strategy , Hospital Costs Outcomes ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study recruit patient undergo angiography investigation stable angina assessment recent , stabilise , non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome event . Eligible patient provide write informed consent randomise conventional angiography additional , routine pressure wire assessment - measuring fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) - main vessel judge sufficient vessel calibre allow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ( experimental arm ) . The study pragmatic design allow investigator conduct diagnostic therapeutic management accordance prevailing best practice pattern . Study outcome measure examine resource utilisation , patient report quality life clinical event 1 year .</detailed_description>
