	<detailed_description>Currently , standard treatment glioma base surgical resection follow radiation therapy . However patient 70 old , surgery systematic , radiotherapy . Moreover , age , surgery likely less well tolerated general term . The aim study try determine best treatment radiation therapy associate surgical treatment care radiotherapy alone , brain biopsy . This randomize , two arm , multicenter , open study . In two week follow radiological diagnosis lesion highly suggestive high-grade glioma , patient randomize either arm surgery ( partial complete excision ) + radiotherapy radiotherapy alone arm . Within 5 week surgery ( biopsy excision ) , patient receive treatment focal radiotherapy . A central review blade MRI data organize inclusion patient . A maximum 135 patient participate trial .</detailed_description>
