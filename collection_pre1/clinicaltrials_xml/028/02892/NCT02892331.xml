	<brief_summary>African Americans substantially great type 2 diabetes risk compare Caucasians ; however , little data available effect exercise train type 2 diabetes risk factor risk African Americans . The present proposal evaluate effect 6 month moderate versus vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training fitness , insulin sensitivity , mitochondrial capacity , skeletal muscle oxidative/insulin sensitivity marker , adiposity , quality life African Americans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>African Americans much great risk type 2 diabetes compare Caucasians United States . Similarly , recent evidence emerge fitness level , major risk factor type 2 diabetes also tend low African Americans . Many scientific study show exercise train beneficial impact fitness level variety type 2 diabetes risk factor reduction glucose/insulin level , body fat Importantly , study perform mostly Caucasian population suggest exercise training vigorous intensity may promote great improvement type 2 diabetes risk factor compare moderate intensity exercise , may suggest great promise reduce type 2 diabetes risk . However , exercise train study compare health benefit different exercise training program ( exercise intensity ) African Americans , clinically important due great type 2 diabetes risk , fact less likely meet public health recommendation physical activity compare Caucasian counterpart . The High Intensity exercise Promote Accelerated improvement CardiorEspiratory fitness ( HI-PACE ) study evaluate effect exercise intensity cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) insulin sensitivity obese ( BMI : 30-45 ) African Americans ( 40-65 yr . ) least 1 additional T2D risk factor . Participants ( n=60 ) recruit collaboration ECU Center Health Disparities , subsequently randomize moderate intensity ( MOD-INT , n=20 ) high intensity ( HIGH-INT , n=20 ) aerobic exercise training , control group ( CON , n=20 ) 24 week . Supervised exercise training perform heart rate associate ~50 % ~75 % VO2 max MOD-INT HIGH-INT group , respectively exercise volume 600 MET-minutes per week ( consistent public health recommendation ) . The primary outcome change CRF , assess baseline , mid-intervention , follow-up . Insulin sensitivity measure via intravenous glucose tolerance test baseline follow-up . Other secondary measure include mitochondrial oxidative capacity use infrared measurement muscle biopsy ( PGC-1α index mitochondrial content ) , expression protein involve insulin action ( GLUT-4 expression ) skeletal muscle well systemic inflammation , adiposity , quality life exercise enjoyment measure .</detailed_description>
