	<brief_title>Influence Electronic Cigarettes Evaluation Inflammatory Response Patients With Diagnosis COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) illness high morbidity mortality society prevalence 10 % population . Smoking represent main risk factor development COPD associate great decrease lung capacity increase mortality . Therefore , early treatment smoke habit essential therapeutic approach . The first line drug treatment proven effective smoking cessation , hand introduction electronic cigarette bring wide impact society , consider possible replacement patient difficulty quit habit ; however still limited information use addition undesirable effect describe lipoid pneumonia . Recent clinical trial show use electronic cigarette may associate symptom like dry cough , mouth irritation , dyspnea , headache . On hand also associate increase airway resistance , immediate decrease exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) FEV1 . Our study aim ass inflammatory response COPD patient regular consumer electronic cigarette compare conventional cigarette smoker . The inclusion criterion study : male patient diagnose COPD Gold B C accord international guideline regular smoker desire quit smoking habit . Exclusion criterion include serious cardiovascular disease , chronic inflammatory disease , active oncologic disease origin , use corticosteroid drug anti-inflammatory effect finally COPD patient acute exacerbation last twelve week . Patients randomize two group : user conventional electronic cigarette . All patient second group provide type electronic cigarette dos inhale nicotine . We perform complete clinical characterization patient collect data relate smoking habit , daily consumption , test assess degree dependence withdrawal symptom , level dyspnea symptom associate tobacco consumption . We perform complete respiratory functional test include spirometry , diffusion capacity measurement exhale carbon monoxide level . Inflammatory involvement airway examine assess concentration exhale nitric oxide , study percentage neutrophil eosinophil induce sputum general analysis determination inflammatory mediator : IL1B , IL6 , IL8 , factor alpha C-reactive protein tumor necrosis . The result evaluate statistical test . The result obtain provide u information effect electronic cigarette COPD effectiveness smoke cessation .</detailed_description>
