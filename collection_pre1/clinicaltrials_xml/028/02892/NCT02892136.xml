	<brief_summary>This study explore new way use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate pediatric patient cardiovascular disease , congenital heart disease patient age , fetuses undergo clinically indicate MR imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technical Development Pediatric Cardiovascular MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol allow development test new MRI technique suitable evaluate patient cardiovascular disease , congenital heart disease , fetal cardiac structure , function , physiology , fetal organ analysis . Individuals refer Children 's National Medical Center clinically indicate cardiac MRI cardiac catheterization primary refer cardiologist obstetrician , enrol study may also undergo additional research imaging . Since technical development work often depend preliminary study healthy volunteer , protocol also recruit healthy subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically indicate exams 1 . Patients undergo medically indicate MRI scan cardiac catheterization procedure 2 . Patients medically judge contraindication MRI scan 3 . Age inclusion : infant adult 4 . Written inform consent assent , applicable Volunteers 1 . Written informed consent normal volunteer 8 year age old noncontrast , nonsedated cardiac MRI 2 . Normal adult volunteer undergo cardiac MRI contrast agent Fetal exams 1 . Age inclusion:18 year older 2 . Second third trimester ( great 13 week ) 1 . All patient medically judge contraindication ( ) MRI scan exclude . Contraindications include implant metal device contraindicate MRI scanning : Central nervous system aneurysm clip ; Implanted neural stimulator ; Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator ; Cochlear implant ; Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) ; Implanted Insulin pump ; Metal shrapnel bullet . 2 . Exclusion criterion Bicycle Stress MRI Myocardial infarction within 24 hour Active myocarditis Uncontrolled heart failure Severe leave ventricular outflow tract obstruction 3 . Exclusion Criteria adult volunteer undergo MRI administration contrast agent : 60 year age old Renal Disease ; Glomerular Filtration rate ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) determine simple blood test do bedside Use diuretic Diagnosis hypertension diabetes 4 . Exclusion criterion volunteer undergo contrast noncontrast MRI scan : Pregnant woman : 1 . Women childbearing potential require screening urine pregnancy test 5 . Exclusion criterion Pregnant woman 15 additional minute lie flat MR scanner would represent risk ( i.e . severe claustrophobia , congestive heart failure ) Pregnant minor age 18 Less 13 week gestation</criteria>
