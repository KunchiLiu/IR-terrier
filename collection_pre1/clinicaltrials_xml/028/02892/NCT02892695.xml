	<criteria>Male female subject CD19+ B cell malignancy patient available curative treatment option except stem cell transplantation , limited prognosis ( several month &lt; 2 year survival ) available treatment option achieve complete remission prior transplant . Some patient enrol CD19CART cell therapy trial may eligible CD19CART cell produce successfully insufficient T cell allow CD19CART cell make ; T cell inefficiently transduce CAR virus ; CART cell expansion fail . All patient must meet following criterion : 1 . Eligible disease : Acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , Follicular lymphoma , Mantle cell lymphoma , Bcell prolymphocytic leukemia , diffuse large cell lymphoma , previously identify CD19+ . 2 . Patients 3 year age old , must life expectancy &gt; 12 week . 3 . Eastern cooperative oncology group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score high 60 . 4 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test subject must agree use effective method contraception two week last infusion CAR NK cell . 5 . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow laboratory requirement : White blood cell count ( WBC ) ≥ 2500c/ml , Platelets ≥ 50×10^9/L , Hb ≥ 9.0g/dL , lymphocyte ( LY ) ≥ 0.7×10^9/L , LY % ≥ 15 % , Alb ≥ 2.8g/dL , serum lipase amylase &lt; 1.5×upper limit normal , serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 5×upper limit normal , serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL . These test must conduct within 7 day prior registration . 6 . Ability give inform consent . 1 . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . 2 . Active HIV , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection time screen . 3 . Serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include active uncontrolled infection , major cardiovascular , coagulation disorder , respiratory immune system , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease , psychiatric emotional disorder . 4 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity agent include cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , aldesleukin . 5 . Concurrent use systemic steroid . Recent current use inhale steroid exclusionary . 6 . The existence unstable active ulcer gastrointestinal bleeding . 7 . Patients need anticoagulant therapy ( warfarin heparin ) . 8 . Patients need longterm antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin dose &gt; 300mg/d ; clopidogrel dose &gt; 75mg/d ) . 9 .
