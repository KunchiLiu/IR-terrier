	<brief_summary>The purpose research study look efficacy ( effect tumor ) safety ( effect body ) study drug give combination patient metastatic recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative inflammatory breast cancer . This phase II study 2 drug use combination : nivolumab ipilimumab . The combination drug already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat advanced melanoma ( type skin cancer ) . Nivolumab ipilimumab approve FDA patient metastatic recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer , hence treatment consider experimental investigational .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Nivolumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV HER2 Negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) patient newly recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) treat nivolumab ipilimumab accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) accord RECIST criterion v1.1 , patient recurrent IBC treat nivolumab ipilimumab . II . To assess overall survival patient recurrent HER2 negative IBC treat nivolumab ipilimumab . III . To assess safety tolerability nivolumab ipilimumab patient recurrent IBC accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v 4.03 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess predictive value baseline iSCORE program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PDL-1 ) expression use archival tissue sample well standard care tissue obtain study treatment . II . To assess predictive value circulate cell-free tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) immune signature exosome analysis use blood sample baseline . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute every 2 week ( Q2W ) ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 6 week ( Q6W ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week 12 week , every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
