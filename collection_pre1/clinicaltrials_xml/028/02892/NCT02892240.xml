	<brief_summary>In 1965 , Emile Letournel Robert Judet report experience acetabular fracture 5th day Raymond Poincaré Hospital Garches . Classification Letournel still relevant use today . Many study seek determine treatment surgical orthopedic . Although standard treatment displace fracture acetabulum reduction osteosynthesis , advocate THA elderly patient comminute fracture acetabulum , impaction femoral head acetabular impaction affect 40 % articular surface include bear zone . All treatment support studied literature . However study lay total hip remote trauma acetabular fracture osteosynthesis treat conservatively , rich literature . Only article publish recent year . Indeed , recent review literature nearly 11 series focus result remotely hip prosthesis treatment acetabular fracture . These two prospective series 21 63 patient . All author report rate well report complication primary arthroplasty , revision rate range 0 26.5 % . Fractures acetabulum cover service one operator use release technique base stiffening . The objective study determine whether systematic surgical treatment patient experience operator reduces high complication rate .</brief_summary>
