	<brief_summary>Low back pain one frequent reason consultation rheumatology . There strong correlation low back pain , presence type Modic 1 signal MRI . The anomaly Modic 1 result hypointense signal T1-weighted image hyperintense T2-weighted sequence ( include T2 STIR / Fat Sat ) contrast enhancement endplates gadolinium injection ; correspond replacement normal cancellous bone fibrovascular tissue . The origin inflammatory process Modic 1 vertebra still unknown . infectious hypothesis raise , include contamination germ call `` slow-growth '' Propionibacterium acne ( PA ) . Many study interest Bacteriological analysis disc material find presence bacteria ( prevalence 0 54 % ) . A recent clinical trial evaluate efficacy antibiotic treatment compare placebo low back pain Modic 1 ; show effectiveness treatment different clinical parameter evaluate . However skin contamination formally exclude , particularly patient previously infiltrate ( include epidural ) . Our hypothesis slow-growing bacteria involve Modic 1 type disc disease , possible presence PA slow-growing bacteria sample obtain discal posterior approach would relate intraoperative contamination preoperative spinal infiltration The main objective ass prevalence germ slow growth intervertebral disc spinal surgery anterior disc disease type 1 Modic .</brief_summary>
