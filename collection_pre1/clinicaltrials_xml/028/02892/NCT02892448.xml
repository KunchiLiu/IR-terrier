	<brief_summary>There may relationship heart function metal ION level patient undergone total hip replacement . The idea use result clinical cardiac MRI ass heart function sample 20 patient also undergone metal-on-metal hip replacement determine whether undergone procedure may impact heart function . In addition clinically use parameter , image also retrospectively assess use special software ass amount fibrosis early change affect cardiac muscle contraction may indicative impaired heart function . With value compare know , previously collect , hip replacement function data determine whether difference heart work hip replacement relative normal population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There recent concern regard possible systemic health effect result elevated blood cobalt concentration patient cobalt contain hip implant ( 1 ) . To date blood cobalt criterion help guide physician evaluate individual hip implant patient 's risk develop systemic health effect historically little concern systemic cobalt toxicity implant patient . Included within heart function , investigator see need use novel software analyze heart function relative Hip status Metal Ion level . Patients metal metal hip prosthesis subject local systemic release cobalt chromium ion may increase potential locally aggressive ion-induced local tissue reaction pseudotumours , type Adverse Reaction Metal Debris ( ARMD ) ( 2 ) . Although report local toxicity well case cobaltism ( see outbreak Quebec call 'cobalt beer drinker ' cardiomyopathy ) lead cardiac ototoxicity , unclear chronic exposure ion lead impaired cardiac function ( cardiotoxicity ) well-functioning prosthesis . The majority blood cobalt concentration report hip implant patient appear range approximately 0.2 10 Âµg/L , base review available literature , pose increase risk development systemic health effect . The concern systemic health effect small number patient cobalt-containing hip implant markedly elevate blood cobalt concentration . Extensive evaluation 'cobalt beer drinker ' find poor nutrition underlie disease state cause severe alcoholism likely significant contribute factor heart disease particular population . However , remain significant concern cardiac function could affect long term . This especially relevant majority implant put patient le 50 year age . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) gold standard method ass cardiac function patient risk cardiotoxicity . In addition assess cardiac function , CMR enable image inflammation , fibrosis ( may secondary ion deposition ) heart may provide specific information mechanism injury patient . The purpose study look cardiac function patient metal metal hip prosthesis . Recruitment : 20 patient total ( 10 unilateral 10 bilateral ) recruit provide indication relationship either instance heart function , well compare one another . All patient undergo clinical cardiac MRI previously undergone Metal Metal hip arthroplasty . All patient extra image collect MRI image analyze determine relationship heart function possible metal ion level hip implant . As part scan analysis require also 5mL vial blood collect . Ultrasound value retrospectively collect , analysis soft tissue reaction , previous clinically order Ultrasound affect joint .</detailed_description>
