	<brief_summary>Hip fracture common , costly affect old people - Canadians spend 1 billion dollar treat hip fracture year . Unfortunately , many two-thirds hip fracture case suffer complication know delirium , acute confusion . Patients delirium may become frightened agitated . This turn lead serious problem . Having delirium double chance die increase need admission nursing home . People delirium spend extra week hospital average . Using ultrasound locate 'freeze ' block specific nerve stop hip fracture pain almost immediately , use technique know reduce delirium administered Anaesthetists patient time hip operation . Unfortunately , patient hip fracture commonly wait hour even day Emergency Department ( ED ) prior operation . Currently , patient give narcotic pain killer like morphine dull pain , ED physician train use 'freezing ' technique Anaesthetists rarely able leave operate room administer freeze patient ED . The EDU-RAPID study test whether train ED physician use nerve freezing technique reduce number patient develop delirium hip fracture . To study , ED physician train 6 hospital small group every 6 week 18 month . The study look patient treat ED physician train compare patient treat ED physician yet train . Also , study see train motivates ED physician use block regularly . If correct , study could significantly improve comfort , quality life , independence patient suffer hip fracture . In addition , study show reduction delirium rate , could represent significant cost reduction health care system .</brief_summary>
