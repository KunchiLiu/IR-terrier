	<brief_summary>Pain surgery unavoidable , opioid medication cornerstone pain management regimen . However , come cost profound impact gastrointestinal motility , respiratory depression , even long-term dependence . Stimulating external ear cutaneous electrical current similar acupuncture could help improve postoperative pain . The Bridge device ( manufacture Key Electronics [ Jeffersonville , IN , USA ] distribute Innovative Health Solutions [ Versailles , IN , USA ] ) , use success treat opioid withdrawal animal study show increase pain threshold . The investigator propose prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial evaluate auricular neurostimulation improve postoperative pain reduces opioid requirement patient undergo elective colon surgery . pain perception post-operative patient may modulate via auricular branch vagus nerve . This potential reduce use opioid medication , turn reduce incidence postoperative ileus reduce patient need dependence narcotic pain medication . This would enormous economic impact due decrease length hospital stay patient undergo abdominal surgery . In addition , opioid reduction could potentially lessen national crisis opioid addiction .</brief_summary>
