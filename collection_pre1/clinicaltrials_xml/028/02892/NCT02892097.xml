	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect three different rehabilitation training session combine non-invasive brain stimulation ( transcranial direct current stimulation , tDCS ) arm rehabilitation training ( repetitive task-specific practice , RTP ) individual unilateral spatial neglect follow stroke . This study design determine effect tDCS + RTP excitability brain , attention affect side , arm movement ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Task-Specific Practice Post-stroke Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral neglect ( neglect ) common stroke characterized inattention one side body environment . There grow evidence disconnection fronto-parietal neural network lesioned hemisphere cause neglect , also cause network hyperexcited non-lesioned hemisphere . Individuals neglect typically experience motor impairment also since region brain control attention also control movement . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) pair repetitive task-specific practice ( RTP ) potential modulate cortical activity ( fronto-parietal network ) facilitate motor attentional recovery individual neglect since tDCS modulate excitability target cortical region . tDCS form non-invasive brain stimulation RTP gold standard post-stroke motor recovery intervention . It particularly important investigator examine effect RTP + tDCS cortical modulation order understand underlie mechanism intervention determine whether RTP+ tDCS ( parietal primary motor cortex [ M1 ] ) promote great neural modulation RTP alone . Traditionally , electrode place M1 facilitate motor recovery parietal lobe facilitate attentional recovery , however intervention design target impairment ( motor , attention ) enhance cortical modulation fronto-parietal network . Therefore , investigator must also determine optimal electrode montage placement pair tDCS RTP individual neglect . The purpose propose pilot project examine effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) pair repetitive task-specific practice ( RTP ) modulation fronto-parietal network connectivity ( measure transcranial magnetic stimulation [ TMS ] ) , motor impairment ( measure kinematic assessment ) , attentional impairment ( measure Behavioral Inattention Test ) among individual unilateral neglect hemiparesis post stroke . This three day cross-over design study examine optimal electrode placement montage use 3 condition : ( 1 ) tDCS parietal lobe + RTP ( 2 ) tDCS primary motor cortex + RTP ( 3 ) sham tDCS + RTP .</detailed_description>
