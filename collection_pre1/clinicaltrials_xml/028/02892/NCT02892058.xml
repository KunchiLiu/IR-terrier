	<brief_summary>The need tool measure flare lower limb osteoarthritis ( OA hip knee ) justify opportunity development clinical trial target hip knee OA long-term treatment ( slow act drug , disease modify drug ) short-term treatment symptom . Such treatment currently development likely bring important change treatment patient . The development Flare-OA tool would essential capture occurrence flare , implement adapt treatment strategy . This project elaborate aim : 1. define construct development conceptual framework 2. use conceptual framework inform development patient-reported outcome measure , Flare-OA tool , people OA 3. evaluate psychometric property new measure use OMERACT ( Outcome Measures Rheumatology ) filter 2.0 Rasch measurement method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronologically , development Flare-OA ( osteoarthritis ) tool address first part project ( Part 1 ) psychometric validity evaluate second part ( Part 2 ) . Part 1 project : The development Flare-OA tool conduct several step , need multiple proficiency qualitative research ( health psychologist ) , quantitative research ( epidemiologist , psychometrician ) , experience disease ( patient ) , experience care disease ( health care professional ) . Two approach take define construct flare lower limb OA : A review literature , development conceptual framework inform result literature . To help define/conceptualize construct `` Flare OA '' procedure implement identify ( key variable , symptom , get bad ) clarify ( exactly variables described literature , patient , clinician . Participants : 1 . - Patients representative disease spectrum , i.e . prevalent case . They recruit clinical setting epidemiological source . 2 . - Health care professional ( HCP ) include General Practitioners , Rheumatologists , Rehabilitation specialist , Orthopaedic surgeon , Nurse general practice orthopedic ward , Physiotherapists .</detailed_description>
