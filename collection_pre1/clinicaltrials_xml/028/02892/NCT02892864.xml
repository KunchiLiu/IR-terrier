The facial feedback hypothesis could one many explication smile induces positive emotional state feeling well-being . In PFP , patient must cope difficulty smile . Their facial behaviour affect emotional experience . Time required improvement risk sequelae proportional severity paralysis ( speed installation axonal loss ) . Do patient benefit virtual care deadline recovery faster control patient ? Does virtual rehabilitation program , home deliver , target smile improve symmetric movement reduce psychological functional issue ? The main purpose present study determine virtual rehabilitation program relevant compare standard therapy . The second aim characterize efficiency analyse time require obtain stable score 4 Sunnybrook test . A secondary objective decrease functional social repercussion facial paralysis intensive target therapy smile . Furthermore , virtual rehabilitation program implement interactive platform . To end , parallel randomize control trial ( RCT ) two group conduct : standard therapy versus virtual rehabilitation program . RCT involve treatment active participation patient necessary assessment blind . Facial motor skill ( tongue , mouth face motricity ) measure use electronic device , objective subjective evaluation pragmatic field communication , emotion quality life . The severity patient 's facial paralysis appraise House Brackmann scale . This global assessment conduct begin therapy every 3 month 18 month . The patient recruit within ENT service baseline assessment . Simple randomization use order establish therapeutic group 45 patient group . Group A : Patients take care consultation within ENT service provide oro-myo-functional classical rehabilitation . Group B : Patients take care external consultation receive oro-myo-functional rehabilitation virtual rehabilitation program target smile , place live virtual condition . Oro-myo-functional classical rehabilitation ( Diels et al . ) : Neuromuscular retrain problem solve approach treatment use selective motor training facilitate symmetrical movement control undesired gross motor activity ( synkinesis ) . Treatment consist accomplish daily massage facial exercise ( ten minute per day ) . Motivation part patient crucial element success treatment Tools feedback specific mirror exercise provide augmented sensory information enhance neural adaptation learning . Patient education basic aspect therapeutic process . The facial therapist provide train basic facial anatomy , physiology kinesiology pertinent patient 's specific situation . Treatment base functional profile . Techniques use facilitate movement inhibit abnormal pattern refine motor control , coordination complexity movement . The specific objective reeducation mobilize paralyzed hemiface avoid over-investment healthy hemiface via relaxation . Focus : inhibit abnormal over-activity rather strengthen muscle . Although patient 's program differs , common aspect treatment patient . The technique base three fundamental principle : - Slow execution maintain inhibition exercise increase - minimal , incremental movement . Initiating movement slowly gradually allow patient observe modify angle , strength speed excursion occur . As result , new motor control strategies systematically develop learn . - Small movement enough mimic expressive movement decrease overflow . Small movement preserve isolated response facial muscle limit motor unit recruitment muscle target . - Symmetry . Patients instructed symmetrical exercise movement reinforce normal physiological response . Clinic treatment session design identify , develop refine movement pattern great benefit patient . Patients practice movement pattern repeat clinic assure accuracy . Through home program , patient consistently practice strategy learn clinic . Virtual Rehabilitation program : It 's e-health context virtual rehabilitation program consider . E-health recent term healthcare practice support electronic process communication . E-health become solution universal access high quality care . The virtual rehabilitation program computerize rehabilitation , remotely manage therapist . This rehabilitation would meet patient ' therapist ' expectation aim deal lack therapist train specific rehabilitation PFP . It avoid frequent binding travel patient . Indeed , kilometric average paralyzed patient take care ENT service Pitié-Salpêtrière 88 km . This virtual rehabilitation program would meet requirement law `` Hospital , Patient , Health Territory `` July 29th , 2009 . This virtual rehabilitation could also help patient stay motivate involve actively rehabilitation process . In fact , patient autonomous actor rehabilitation . Furthermore , visual feedback provide avatar help execute movement proper way Patient data transfer therapist . At distance , clinician able straighten exercise execute update method wait next patient consultation . The patient front screen avatar produce `` praxies '' accord evolution severity PFP ( House Brackmann scale ) . It recommend observe avatar repeatedly ( three time day two week ) , patient learn appropriate motor scheme . Then , patient apply `` implementation-intention `` technique order find movement circumstance . This technique consist repeat mentally advance deliberate movement , execute spontaneously every-day-life situation . Administration tool present two sector : allow one hand consult record patient ( addition , modification , consultation exercise video , rehabilitation management updating , indication next recommended exercise , addition note next session ... ) . On hand , allow manage exercise include number pose . For every pose , maintain pose time number iteration pose indicate . Digital , still sub-used technology , represent real potential improve professional practice . The patient training tool Windows run-time software connect database downloads exercise session . This connexion involve automatic identification . The software begin message post therapist . Then , simple interface , include half-screen posting see webcam another half-screen showing avatar serve model training session . The patient able record pose try need . In end , message indicate end current session . Statistical Analysis : Between-two-groups analysis conduct order compare target intensive implementation-intention rehabilitation virtual rehabilitation program standard therapy . This virtual therapy consist repeat mentally movement desire , spontaneously execute every-day-life situation . All quantitative variable , Sunnybrook score , bilabial strength , House-Brackmann score , MADRS score Quality Life score described average score , standard deviation , median score , minimum maximum score . Category-specific variable Spielberg stress scale , Mouth-tongue-face motricity assessment describe frequency percentage . Missing data take account calculation Reliable interval 95 % supplied necessary . Percentages group compare Pearson X2 test Fisher test accord distribution . Continuous data compare Student test Mann-Whitney test , accord distribution . P-values must lower 0,05 order consider statistically significant..
