	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Surgery Abdominal Compliance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale . Abdominal laparoscopic surgery widely use . The meet good condition , surgeon need large enough workspace . Carbonic gaz insufflate intraperitoneal space limit induced pressure usually must 15mm mercury ( Hg ) subsequent organ failure . The relationship pressure gaz volume insufflate defines abdominal compliance ( ΔV/ΔP ) . The use neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) often use abdominal laparoscopic surgery order reduce abdominal tonus , create sufficient laparoscopic workspace hence improve abdominal compliance . However , consider good working condition could achieve use NMBA , factor could consider like body weight , length , BMI , surgical abdominal history , parity . Main objective : To compare work surgical condition pneumoperitoinea volume obtain abdominal laparoscopic surgery without initial NMBA use . Hypothesis : The use NMBA improve incidence good surgical working condition . Study Design : Randomized blind clinical trial . Two patient group compare , one receiving NMBA one receiving placebo . Randomisation realise 1/1 ratio block 4 . The primary outcome composite criterion : obtention laparoscopic workspace great 3 liter associate abdominal pressure lesser 15mmHg good surgical rating scale . A statistical analysis reveal 90 patient group need include estimate 90 % satisfy surgical condition NMBA group 70 % placebo group . In placebo group , surgical condition correct ( insufflated volume lesser 3 liter surgeon dissatisfaction ) , NMBA use . This define secondary use NMBA . Methods : Anesthesia induce patient target control infusion propofol sufentanil respectively initial target 6 microgram/ml 0,4 ng/ml . The initial NMBA bolus NMBA group 0,15 mg/kg cisatracurium . A similar volume isotonic saline serum use placebo group . The abdomen inflate 5 , 10 15 mmHg volume pressure level measure order evaluate abdominal compliance . After measure , anesthesiologist unblinded NMBA use . If workspace volume lesser 3 liter , , case surgeon dissatisfaction ( use surgical rating scale ) , NMBA use , define secondary NMBA use . Anesthesia maintain continous infusion propofol sufentanil aim BIS target 40 60 . When use , curarisation maintain continuous infusion cisatracurium ( 0,06 0,12 mg/kg/h ) targetting 0 1 TOF response . Safety issue : During anesthesia induction , ventilation tracheal intubation difficulty happen , anesthesiologist unblinded anesthesia protocol use .</detailed_description>
