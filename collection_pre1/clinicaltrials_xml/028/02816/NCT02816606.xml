	<brief_summary>Following recent advance understand successful anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction , three important factor identify : femoral tunnel positioning , femoral tunnel aperture shape , native remnant preservation . Accordingly , researcher adapt technique address goal . This study design assess feasibility evaluate graft characteristic , post-operative imaging , ability show potential improvement researcher ' technical change . The study plan use three-dimensional computer tomography ( 3D-CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ass property integration graft . In addition , researcher use routine functional score monitor patient ' outcome . If successful , research team hope set-up randomise control trial alternative technique versus conventional method assessment image mediums clinical follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Radiology Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rupture ACL incidence 30 case per 100,000 individual UK . The number reconstruction perform increase patient wish maintain optimum knee function stability , old age-groups , previously see . The research centre ( hospital ) presently perform 100 150 ACL reconstruction year , thus , figure likely continue rise . The ACL performs role prevent anterior translation tibia femur , throughout range motion knee , also provide rotational stability . Inadequate post-injury function , failure , result continue feeling instability ( within knee ) may prevent return employment well recreational activity . This particular importance heavy manual worker competitor change-of-direction sport . Reconstruction ACL commonly involve use autologous hamstring patellar tendon graft implant arthroscopic procedure . Rehabilitation , follow reconstruction , lengthy graft take month incorporate year regain mechanical property . Therefore , patient undergo long period functional rehabilitation , guidance physiotherapist , repeat outpatient surgical follow-up ass recovery detect rare ( important ) complication surgery . As understanding anatomy biomechanics ACL improve , technique use perform procedure evolve accordingly . The goal reconstructive surgery restore stability knee allow patient return employment recreational activity . Research last 5 year increasingly turn define anatomy ligament positioning graft anatomical position . Bony landmarks identify position femoral footprint ACL - intercondylar bifurcate ridge - make position graft accurately possible . Appreciation importance remnant tissue - indication previous attachment conduit revascularisation graft - bony landmarks tibial femoral attachment , ligament , lead change surgical philosophy technique . Of particular interest femoral tunnel . Successful ACL reconstruction clearly show associated femoral tunnel position graft centre original footprint replicates normal biomechanics knee . As degree variation individual , previous method position graft relative structure ( use surrogate measurement ) supersede need identify remain anatomical landmark . Therefore , operative technique focus femoral footprint identification centre graft within area . Standard technique , use 30-degree arthroscope , provide limited view femoral tibial footprint . This due orientation structure within knee - parallel direction arthroscope introduce knee lateral portal . Remnant ACL tissue remove , improve visualisation prevent impingement , felt beneficial . As recognised remnant preservation important , two conflicting challenge exist . The first improve visualisation whilst second preserve ACL stump much possible . Attempts improve view obtain lead surgeon suggest introduce arthroscope medial portal . However , without additional problem instrument overcrowd fluid leak knee . A 70-degree arthroscope increase field vision ( particularly structure parallel scope ) without make additional portal site . Therefore , researcher begin use instrument within team . Although , improve view , researcher think improve positioning graft , difficult ass either intra-operatively post-operative plain radiograph . 3D-CT validated accurate tool assessment femoral tunnel placement post-operative patient . Previous study able use measure position tunnel , tunnel aperture dimension volume tunnel within bone . Visualisation also affect reamer use create tunnel graft . Traditional reamer use rigid wire . In order introduce knee , without cause damage structure , knee must maximally flex . This lead problem flow arthroscopy fluid ( confined space ) may cloud operative field . This may impossible achieve obese well-muscled patient result ream take place without good view positioning . A flexible reaming system use knee less flexed position improve view obtain . In addition , flexible guidewire ( flexible reamer ) enters femoral wall obliquely , aperture create circular reamer oval shape length femoral tunnel may also improve . This potentially mean great volume graft within femur great surface area integration . The aperture shape , length volume femoral tunnel study 3D-CT . This study femoral tunnel characteristic compare intra-operative assessment position size , good correlation , simple technique may use future without need patient CT scan . A single CT study sufficient make assessment parameter study . The research team previously publish novel technique ( use 70-degree arthroscope ) achieve good visualisation footprint give surgeon well chance position graft within desire area ( native ACL footprint ) . Another group publish combine technique 70-degree arthroscope flexible reamer suggest advantage anticipate term tunnel characteristic . The researcher wish formally evaluate success alternative method standard technique . The goal ACL remnant preservation ( placement tunnel within tissue ) show result increase revascularisation graft , increase cell-proliferation , improve proprioception knee post-operatively . However , show whether new technique ( use 70-degree arthroscope flexible reamer ) impact ability surgeon achieve . Therefore , comparison heal rate ligament appearance perform use modify technique versus traditional method interest . MRI sensitive visualisation soft-tissue structure . The researcher , therefore , use modality evaluate graft remnant tissue . This allow research team ass position graft , within remnant tissue , integration graft time . Other group able use MRI way assess revascularisation graft maturation graft material time . As MRI use ass graft integration , need repeat ( throughout follow-up period ) make serial measurement quantify progression . If researcher show feasible replicate previous successful use MRI ( well CT ) , record clear difference use flexible reamer 70-degree arthroscope , lead randomise control trial ( RCT ) technique versus standard method . The researcher hope demonstrate CT MRI use accurately measure graft position , tunnel shape heal also difference technique main trial . As standard technique use surgeon within research team 's department , provide researcher access comparative group . The team able record result arm , provide information conduct full scale RCT . It also allow quantification change researcher expect measure , RCT , aid power calculation require guide recruitment number . The required additional imaging time routine out-patient follow-up appointment .</detailed_description>
