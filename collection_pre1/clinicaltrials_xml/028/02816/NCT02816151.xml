	<brief_summary>Detrusor hyperactivity urodynamic observation define involuntary detrusor contraction vesical filling . Within neurological bladder child , especially related spinal dysraphisms , hyperactivity , associate vesical compliance disorder , involve urinary incontinence obstruct social integration possibly vesical pressure rise intra- potentially generate high urinary tract lesion . Anticholinergic drug possibly associate vesical drain constitute treatment first intention . In approximately 15 20 % case , intradetrusor iterative injection type A Botulinum Toxin propose fault satisfactory result . Largely used accord European consensus 2008 without AM , actual study remain realized small number low level proof . Posology remain discussed pharmaceutical laboratory ( derivative effective maximum amount per adult kg weight ) weaker amount use clinical result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Children Toxine Botulinum Detrusor Injection Neurogenic Vesical Hyperactivity Syndrom : Non Inferiority Multicenter Controlled Therapeutic Study Between Two Reported Weight 's Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim study determine dosages mid -- amount TBA would make possible anticipate not-inferiors result full posology determine benefit ratio/risk improvement . This could lead important reduction treatment cost . This study also aim good identy `` non responder '' patient order refine indication . Thanks participation French urologic paediatric surgery center , study hope homogenize practice use standardized common criterion judgement . Lastly , study appreciate possible bring back posology weight child , detrusor surface allow precise estimation amount manage . A complementary study quality life child treatment carry thanks Child Health Questionnaire ( CHQ 50 ) . The diagram study randomize therapeutic test control not-inferiority aim compare amount full versus half-amount TBA . The population study make child 3 15 year treat detrusor hyperactivity , confirm aurodynamic assessment accord criterion International Society Continence , origin neurological , resistant medical care associate usual accompanying measure .</detailed_description>
