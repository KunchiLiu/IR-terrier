	<brief_summary>This Phase II , single-arm , multicentre study Daratumumab ( 16mg/kg IV route ) adult patient Light-Chain ( AL ) Amyloidosis VGPR well previous treatment . A sample size 40 patient meet eligibility criterion enrol receive study treatment . Patients receive treatment either disease progression toxicity occur maximum plan six 28-day cycle . Daratumumab administrate every week first 2 cycle . every 2 week cycle 3 cycle 6 . Patients also receive best supportive care ( BSC ) mitigate Daratumumab side-effects , address underlying Amyloidosis , include blood product transfusion , antimicrobial , ( appropriate ) growth factor include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor neutropenia , erythropoietin anaemia , and/or transfusion thrombocytopenia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daratumumab Therapy Patients With Refractory Relapsed AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic AL amyloidosis rare disease cause deposition misfolded monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chain ( FLC ) various tissue organ . It usually associate clonal plasma cell dyscrasia low tumour burden . Treatment AL amyloidosis relies mainly chemotherapy aim suppress underlie plasma cell clone secrete monoclonal FLC . The organ response survival greatly influenced degree hematological response evaluate decrease serum FLC principal endpoint recent trial AL amyloidosis . The goal treatment reach least good partial response ( VGPR ) define difference involve FLC normal &lt; 40 mg/l . Over last 2 year , Daratumumab , novel , high-affinity , therapeutic , human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) specifically recognize CD38 epitope emerge breakthrough targeted therapy patient myeloma . Taking account , 90 % AL patient , monoclonal cell produce amyloidogenic FLC Cluster Differentiation 38 ( CD38 ) express plasma cell Daratumumab promise treatment AL amyloidosis . The study consist 4 step : - A 21 day screen period This period start screen visit may occur 21 day first study drug administration . After signature inform consent form , procedure perform ensure patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion document health status receive study treatment . These assessment include quality life questionnaires - A treatment period Patient eligible enter study receive 6 cycle 28 day intra venous Daratumumab . During cycle 1 2 , Daratumumab administer weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle 3 6 , Daratumumab administer every two week day 1 15 . Patient assessment ignition new cycle document haematological organ response intra cycle watch toxicity . - An end study visit ( PD unacceptable adverse event occurs , plan end study visit ) . Study procedures perform 28 day ( Â± 15 ) last dose study medication patient , include early termination patient . - Followup period After treatment discontinuation , followup make patient every 3 month least 1 year inquire patient 's hematological organ status , general health , information new medical event . DOSING REGIMEN Daratumumab . Six 28-day cycle , 16 mg/kg administer IV route , During cycle 1 2 , Daratumumab administer weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 For cycle 3 6 , Daratumumab administer every week day 1 15</detailed_description>
