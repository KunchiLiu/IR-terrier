	<brief_summary>Massive haemoptysis life-threatening condition commonly see patient previously pulmonary tuberculosis . Various treatment option exist bronchial artery embolisation ( BAE ) surgical resection affect lung region . However , BAE consider curative often recurrence haemoptysis . Furthermore , patient deem suitable surgical resection , leave treatment option . A possible alternative intervention insertion endobronchial valve ( EBV ) . It speculate blood collect distal one way valve thrombus form . There currently data describe use EBV treatment massive haemoptysis . This RCT aim explore use efficacy EBV management massive haemoptysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Massive haemoptysis commonly occur patient tuberculosis . While surgical resection affect lung segment curative , large majority patient may qualify surgical intervention number reason . This leave option manage haemoptysis . Many patient Tygerberg Hospital severely reduce cardiopulmonary reserve secondary multiple episode pulmonary Tuberculosis often present either unilateral largely destroyed lung bilateral disease , make unsuitable surgery . For unfortunate patient qualify surgery repeat BAE , practically treatment option exist , significant proportion die hospital discharge recurrent episode massive haemoptysis . For patient option may block bleed bronchus ( identify previous BAE bronchoscopy ) balloon catheter ( Fogarty catheter ) placement haemostatic gauze gel . All procedure , however , limited benefit . Using block device could deploy left place permanently remove need become new therapeutic concept . Dutau colleague report successful use endoscopic placement silicone Spigot 39-year-old-woman massive haemoptysis prevent alveolar inundation precede time bronchial artery embolisation . Our institution long stand experience massive haemoptysis , clinically scientifically . We evaluate 80-100 patient life threaten haemoptysis year . Furthermore , involve early emphysema trial use IBVEBV® ( Intra-Bronchial Valve ) Spiration , therefore , necessary experience valve implantation technique . No data available regard potential clinical use endobronchial valve patient recurrence haemoptysis BAE patient candidate surgery BAE . This study aim investigate use , therapeutic benefit safety IBV Zephyr® valve inoperable patient haemoptysis respond BAE case BAE consider feasible . This prospective randomise intervention-control study , patient allocate either best medical care ( control ) endobronchial valve ( intervention ) group . The valve insert via flexible bronchoscopy affect lung region . The primary outcome measure time resolution massive haemoptysis . Secondary outcome include physical lung function occurrence complication result insertion EBV . Statistical analysis perform blinded patient group statistician , univariate multivariate analysis perform use appropriate parametric non-parametric test . Appropriate test categorical data ( e.g . Chi-squared test ) continuous data ( e.g . Kruskal-Wallis , ANOVA ) use . Logistic linear regression model use certain outcome , multivariate analysis perform use stepwise regression model full modelling appropriate .</detailed_description>
