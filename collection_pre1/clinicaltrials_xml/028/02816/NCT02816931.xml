	<brief_summary>Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) steadily increase world-wide , urge need improve treatment strategy . In order protect available drug leave , ensure adequate plasma concentration drug important . Individualized therapy use plasma drug concentration minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) determination may importance ( 1 ) . The plasma drug concentration MICs second-line drug compare , aim increase knowledge pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) indices treatment MDR-TB . In future , aim individualise therapy , sub-therapeutic drug concentration adjust use therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) . TDM treatment MDR-TB may improve clinical outcome patient , plasma concentration must assess together clinical microbiological factor ( 2 ) . In observational study hypothesis ratio drug concentration MICs anti-tuberculous drug , correlate time sputum culture conversion , bacterial load measure time positive liquid culture ( TTP ) clinical outcome . Consenting adult patient pulmonary MDR-TB patient China recruit . MIC-determination Mycobacterium tuberculosis perform BACTEC 960 MGIT drug concentration determine 2 , 4 8 week treatment initiation use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) , simultaneously assess Dried Blood Spot ( DBS ) bio-sampling method . Sputum culture obtain regularly throughout treatment measure time culture positivity ( TTP ) . Clinical follow accord WHO criteria performed end treatment completion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consenting adult patient active pulmonary MDR-TB study hospital China ( n=50 ) , include study . Detailed demographic background information well baseline clinical characteristic collect . Sputum sample culture Time culture positivity ( TTP ) collect inclusion day 2 , 7 week 2 , 4 , 8 12 week start treatment . MIC-determination Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug include patient 's treatment , perform mainly use Sensititre TREK kit , complement BACTEC 960 MGIT necessary . After two week TB-treatment , plasma drug concentration drug use collect . Multiple blood sample ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 h drug intake ) collect order accurately calculate free area time-versus concentration curve ( fAUC ) maximum concentration ( fCmax ) . The exposure variables fAUC fCmax ratio MIC bacteria different drug . Furthermore , blood sample assess stability drug concentration perform week 8 week 12 ( 0 , 4 6 h post-dose ) . In order evaluate low ratio fAUC/MIC fCmax/MIC associate poor clinical outcome , clinical parameter well sputum culture conversion , time culture positivity ( TTP ) , inflammatory marker radiological imaging follow first three month treatment . After treatment completion , WHO criteria define treatment outcome apply . Furthermore , method simultaneous determination use LC-MS/MS second-line drug use , develop compare use Dried Blood Spot assay ( DBS ) . DBS advantage enable drug concentration analysis even remote area , since transportation filter paper easy .</detailed_description>
