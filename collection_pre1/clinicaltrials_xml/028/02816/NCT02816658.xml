	<brief_title>The Role Robotic Platform Inguinal Hernia Repair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia repair commonly perform general surgery procedure United States . Despite prevalence procedure , consensus regard optimal approach surgical procedure . Since advent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair 1990 , grow body research investigate efficacy minimally invasive surgical approach . To date , laparoscopic approach inguinal hernia repair proven beneficial reduce post-operative pain allow early return normal activity versus traditional open inguinal hernia repair . In addition , laparoscopic approach inguinal hernia repair advocate recurrent inguinal hernia repair bilateral inguinal hernia repair . Despite advantage , however , several limitation laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair . Specifically , unstable camera platform , two-dimensional imaging , rigid laparoscopic instrument , poor surgeon ergonomics make laparoscopic approach inguinal hernia repair challenge . Furthermore , learn curve associate laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair prohibitive many surgeon . Finally , laparoscopic approach inguinal hernia repair often require utilization form fixation device , surgical tack , associate chronic pain , vascular injury , well increase overall cost operation . The robotic platform show help compensate many short-comings laparoscopic surgery provide three-dimensional imaging , improve instrument mobility , articulation , suture capability ( allow cost-effective procedure decrease risk post-operative chronic pain ) , surgeon comfort . Because reason , important determine specific advantage robotic approach provide inguinal hernia repair . The laparoscopic approach inguinal hernia repair proven beneficial reduce post-operative pain earlier return normal activity versus traditional open inguinal hernia repair . However , overall penetrance laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair remain consistently 20 % inguinal hernia procedure perform United States . The robotic platform provide several potential advantage laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair include three dimensional visualization , ability suture ( rather tack ) mesh , well ability suture peritoneal defect close . This technological platform could provide early adoption proficiency surgeon perform minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair improve surgical outcome . As general surgeon begin incorporate robotic surgery practice , robotic platform might provide improvement outcomes minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair even traditional laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair . The investigator propose Randomized Clinical Trial compare robotic versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair technique . The investigator hypothesize robotic approach inguinal hernia repair result improve post-operative outcome compare traditional laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair . Specific Aim # 1 : To determine robotic approach result significant reduction postoperative pain earlier return full function compare laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair . Specific Aim # 2 : To perform cost analysis determine financial implication perform robotic versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair . Specific Aim # 3 : To determine effect surgeon report ergonomics perform laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair . Specific Aim # 4 : Evaluate long term hernia recurrence rate associate laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair .</detailed_description>
