Two critical treatment element ( peer generalization , homework assignment ) difficult implement traditional clinical setting , limit optimal dissemination youth need service different setting ( e.g. , school , outpatient , community facility ) . In recently complete Phase I STTR , investigator develop validated interactive virtual environment ( VE ) solve need intensive behavioral practice opportunity critical skill generalization . The VE , know Pegasys-VR™ , allow intensive practice social skill without need formal peer group activity ( clinic solution ) intensive parental involvement ( at-home solution ) . The result indicate implement VE environment SET-C program accessible , credible feasible parent , clinician child participate trial . Furthermore , examination within group change indicate statistically significant improvement SAD symptom . Given success Phase I , need increase automation system increase acceptance adoption among clinician socially anxiety youth , Phase II STTR study follow goal : incorporate artificial intelligence natural language system , develop additional VEs in-clinic practice , expand homework solution provide additional opportunity reinforce skill acquisition generalization practice in-vivo setting , use serious game theory technology , conduct randomize controlled trial youth age 7 12 test whether Pegasys-VR™ effective traditional behavioral intervention youth social anxiety disorder effect maintain 3 month follow-up . If Pegasys-VR™ clinically efficacious , would offer sustainable , cost-effective intervention easily rapidly disseminate .</detailed_description>
