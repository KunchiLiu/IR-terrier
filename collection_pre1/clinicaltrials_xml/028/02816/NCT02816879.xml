	<brief_summary>This clinical trial compare three anal cytology collection procedure ( collect single visit ) men sex men ( MSM ) . It also compare two different test human papilloma virus , virus cause high grade anal dysplasia , think occur anal cancer . This study may help doctor develop well screen high-grade anal dysplasia MSM order identify need return additional screening treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anal Cytology Collection Procedures Predicting High-Grade Anal Dysplasia Men Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate sensitivity &amp; specificity , predictive positive value ( PPV ) , &amp; predictive negative value ( PNV ) ( test characteristic ) &amp; cellularity , beta-globin , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , &amp; protein ( quality measure ) nylon-flocked ( NF ) - &amp; Dacron-swab protocol detect biopsy-detected high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( HG-AIN ) &amp; human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -infections , use randomized-controlled study design . II . Evaluate test characteristic anal cancer screen algorithms incorporate sequentially simultaneously perform high-threshold molecular HPV test , &amp; without cytology , predict HG-AIN . III . Evaluate cost-effectiveness &amp; relative cost single- &amp; multiple-test anal cancer screen algorithm . OUTLINE : Patients undergo anal cytology collection use 2 NF swab 1 Dacron swab analysis via Papanicolaou ( Pap ) staining , HPV genotyping , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .</detailed_description>
