	<detailed_description>All participant judge prostate cancer stage Ⅲ-Ⅳand consider able conduct radiotherapy . 180 patient enrolled trial randomly divide three group . Three arm respectively treat CT、18F-FDG PET/CT、18F-FDG PET/MRI . The image pass three-dimensional treatment planning system , use software manually fusion reconstruction PET CT. All patient adopt IMRT radiotherapy 70Gy-80Gy . Three month radiotherapy , solid tumer size prostate cancer assesed PET / CT CT . Early radiation reaction evaluate United States RTOG ( RTOG ) acute response evaluation criterion , late radiation reaction evaluate RTOG European Radiation Therapy Oncology Organization ( EORTC ) . Before radiotherapy treatment , tumor-associated marker PSA monitor patient regularly followed-up next three year .</detailed_description>
