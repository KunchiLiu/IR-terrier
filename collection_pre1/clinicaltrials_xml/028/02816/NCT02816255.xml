	<brief_title>The Efficacy New Mathematical Formula Predict Continuous Positive Air Pressure With Oronasal Mask Interface .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study test efficacy algorithm previously create adjust Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) mask interface switch nasal full face . Subjects currently moderate severe Apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI - The Apnea-Hypopnea Index Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index ( AHI ) index use indicate severity sleep apnea . It represent number apnea hypopnea event per hour sleep ) . ( 15 ) - Scoring apnea Score respiratory event apnea BOTH follow criterion meet : N1 , N2 , N3 , N4 1 . There drop peak signal excursion ≥90 % pre-event baseline use oronasal thermal sensor ( diagnostic study ) , PAP device flow ( titration study ) alternative apnea sensor ( diagnostic study ) 2 . The duration ≥90 % drop sensor signal ≥ 10 second . Score apnea obstructive meet apnea criterion associate absent inspiratory effort throughout entire period absent airflow . Score apnea central meet apnea criterion associate absent inspiratory effort throughout entire period absent airflow . Score apnea mixed meet apnea criterion associate absent inspiratory effort initial portion event , follow resumption inspiratory effort second portion event . N4 Note 1 - Identification apnea require minimum desaturation criterion . Note 2 - If portion respiratory event would otherwise meet criterion hypopnea meet criterion apnea , entire event score apnea . Note 3 - If apnea hypopnea event begin end epoch scored sleep , correspond respiratory event score included computation apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) . This situation usually occur individual ; high AHI event occur frequently sleep severely disrupt epoch may end score wake even though &lt; 15 second sleep present epoch contain portion respiratory event . However apnea hypopnea occur entirely epoch score wake , score count towards apnea hypopnea index difficultly define denominator situation . If occurrence prominent feature polysomnogram and/or interfere sleep onset , presence mention narrative summary study . Note 4 - For alternative apnea sensor see tech specification Adults . There sufficient evidence support specific duration central obstructive component mixed apnea thus specific duration component recommend . - AASM 2015 PROTOCOL Scoring Hypopneas Score respiratory event hypopnea follow criterion meet . N1 , N2 , N3 . 1 . The peak signal excursion drop ≥30 % pre-event baseline use nasal pressure ( diagnostic study ) , PAP device flow ( titration study ) , alternative hypopnea sensor ( diagnostic study ) . 2 . The duration ≥30 % drop signal excursion ≥10 second . 3 . There ≥3 % oxygen desaturation pre-event baseline event associate arousal . Subjects consent entered study , two week baseline period use nasal mask use airview cpap machine ( record data ) . After two week period switch full face mask half use CPAP pressure half new cpap pressure derive formula final two week . Those place randomized new pressure experimental procedure get new pressure . We expect AHI control increase . Our two new formula refer Opred ( oronasal ) ( full face mask ) Npred ( nasal ) ( non-full face mask ) . Npred= ( 0.017 AHI ) - ( 0.092 LSaO2 ) + ( 0.225 NC ) +5.534 Opred= ( 0.03 AHI ) - ( 0.130 LSaO2 ) +19.732 NC=Neck circumference , AHI= baseline AHI , LSaO2= Lowest blood oxygen saturation baseline polysomnogram . These model develop use multiple linear regress modeling . The study self-funded funding . Subjects compensate</detailed_description>
