	<brief_summary>Late-life depression characterize affective ( mood ) symptom cognitive deficit . There currently intervention may provide consistent benefit mood cognitive performance . Agonist activity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor via transdermal nicotine patch may provide benefit mood cognition , work nicotine 's effect brain neural network , specifically cognitive control network default mode network . In initial pilot project , investigator test hypotheses 15 nonsmoking depressed elder subjective cognitive impairment . Following baseline neuroimaging cognitive testing , participant receive 12 week open-label transdermal nicotine . Afterwards , participant repeat neuroimaging cognitive assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depressed Mood Improvement Through Nicotine Dosing ( Depressed MIND Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late-life depression ( LLD ) characterize affective symptom cognitive deficit . The co-occurrence cognitive deficit LLD clinically relevant phenotype characterize significant disability poor antidepressant response . Cognitive deficit persist even successful antidepressant treatment increase risk depression relapse . Despite clinical importance cognitive deficit LLD , establish treatment specifically target cognition population . The lack treatment improve cognitive deficit depression deficiency current therapeutic . Modulation cholinergic system nicotinic receptor stimulation may improve mood cognition depress elder . Clinically , transdermal nicotine improve mood smoker placebo-controlled pilot trial nonsmoking adult find transdermal nicotine significantly improve mood . In previous trial examine Mild Cognitive Impairment , transdermal nicotine safely improve cognitive function test attention , episodic memory , process speed . These cognitive domain impaired LLD . The investigator hypothesize effect mood cognition mediate nicotine 's effect increase cognitive control network activity reduce default mode network ( DMN ) activity . This pattern network activity task demand external attention associate well task performance . Furthermore , see smoker , nicotine 's effect network reduce depression 's bias negatively valenced stimuli decrease rumination . The central hypothesis LLD , transdermal nicotine safely improve depression increase activity cognitive control region decrease activity DMN region . This result decrease attentional bias reactivity negative stimulus . A secondary hypothesis transdermal nicotine also improve subjective objective cognitive performance network effect . Primary Aim 1 : To determine whether administration transdermal nicotine 12 week improve clinical symptom patient LLD subjective cognitive impairment ( SCI ) . Hypothesis 1 : Transdermal nicotine administration result reduction depression severity measure Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ; primary mood outcome ) . It also result improvement broader assessment depressive symptomatology , include anhedonia , apathy , fatigue , sleep , rumination ( secondary outcome ) . Hypothesis 2 : Transdermal nicotine administration result improvement attentional performance Conner 's Continuous Performance Task ( CPT ; primary cognitive outcome ) . It also result improvement subjective objective cognitive performance task measure attention , episodic memory , work memory , process speed , executive function ( secondary outcome ) . Secondary Aim 2 : To determine whether administration transdermal nicotine 12 week modulate canonical intrinsic functional network activity LLD SCI . Hypothesis 3 : On repeat administration Posner task external attention , transdermal nicotine administration result increase activity within cognitive control network decrease activity within default mode network . Hypothesis 4 : Transdermal nicotine administration result increase functional connectivity within cognitive control network decrease connectivity within default mode network rest . Hypothesis 5 : Changes intrinsic network activity / connectivity transdermal nicotine administration associate change mood symptom subjective objective cognitive performance .</detailed_description>
