	<detailed_description>Mouse brain-derived Japanese Encephalitis ( JE ) vaccine develop Vietnam since 1989 support WHO BIKEN institute , Japan . It help Viet Nam prevent Japanese Encephalitis outbreak successfully year . However , mouse brain-derived JE vaccine production require company compliance various requirement WHO . Especially , WHO plan replace mouse brain-derived JE vaccine Cell culture-derived JE vaccine . Vero cell-derived vaccine technology show many advantage compare Mouse brain-derived vaccine technology . VABIOTECH approve sponsored Ministry Science Technology produce Vero cell - derive JE vaccine . The vaccine demonstrate good safety immunogenicity profile animal model . The vaccine proven safety volunteer adult . In study , dose escalate study 3 different dose regimen study vaccine ( JECEVAX ) license vaccine ( JEVAX-VABIOTECH Vietnam ) conduct Vietnamese child , age 9-24 month ass safety immunogenicity . Two hundred child enrol randomly assign 4 group ( 50 children/group ) , receive 2 dos investigate vaccine control vaccine subcutaneously , 10-12 day interval . Safety issue include immediate reaction site injection systemic reaction within 30 min administration , solicit unsolicited adverse event occur first dose 30 day second dose ; SAE ( start first dose 30 day second dose ) , blood cell count , urea , ALT , AST . Immunogenicity outcomes include seroconversion neutralize antibody ( blood sample take prior 1st dose 20-22 day post 2nd dose ) .</detailed_description>
