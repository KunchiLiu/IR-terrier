	<brief_title>Study Oral Azacitidine ( CC-486 ) Combination With Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 3 week . Participant take azacitidine mouth 1 time day Days 1-15 cycle . Participant receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1-3 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 1 ( do screening ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn learn study drug affect disease . - During Cycle 3 , participant 4 core needle tumor biopsy . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 4 : - Participant physical exam . - Participant MRI CT scan . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test learn study drug affect disease . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 5 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant 4 core needle tumor biopsy . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 6 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Cycle 7 , blood use learn study drug affect disease . - During Cycle 7 , participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 8 every 4 cycle ( Cycles 12 , 16 , 20 , ) , participant MRI CT scan . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine testing learn study drug affect disease . - Participant MRI CT scan . - If participant stop treatment disease get bad , participant may 4 core needle tumor biopsy . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . Follow-Up : If participant stop take study drug reason disease get bad , participant MRI CT scan every 6 week . After 1 year , participant scan every 9 week . If disease appear get bad time , participant may eligible re-treated pembrolizumab additional year ( describe ) . Re-Treatment : If disease get bad follow-up participant still eligible , participant may able receive 1 year additional treatment pembrolizumab . If participant continue receive pembrolizumab , participant receive dose schedule describe . Participant also continue study visit describe . Safety Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug participant start new anti-cancer treatment ( whichever happen first ) , participant safety follow-up visit . At visit , participant physical exam participant MRI CT scan . This may mean participant 2 safety follow-up visit participant receives additional year pembrolizumab . Long-Term Follow-Up : After follow-up , participant call every 12 week member study staff learn participant . This call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . It consider investigational use drug combination treat melanoma . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 71 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
