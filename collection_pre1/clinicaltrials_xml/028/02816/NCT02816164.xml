	<brief_summary>In patient early-stage breast cancer , chemotherapy substantially improve survival rate . Improvements outcomes , however , compromise considerable toxicity associate chemotherapy , notable neutropenia . Neutropenia presence abnormally white blood cell , lead increase susceptibility infection require hospitalization need intravenous antibiotic sometimes fatal . Febrile neutropenia ( FN ) also associate treatment delay dose reduction , potentially compromise treatment efficacy . Patients receive medication reduce risk FN Neupogen ( filgrastim ) daily injection 5 , 7 10 day . Since genuine uncertainty among healthcare professional administration schedule Neupogen best patient , investigator perform randomize study patient receive either 5 , 7 10 day Neupogen . Neupogen cost approximately $ 200/injection , physician prescribes 10 day 8 cycle treatment , cost $ 16,000 compare 5 day treatment would cost half . In addition cost saving , many patient able give injection daily basis require nursing resource utilized high cost . This study use oral consent model compare 5 , 7 10 day Neupogen evaluate rate febrile neutropenia hospitalization .</brief_summary>
