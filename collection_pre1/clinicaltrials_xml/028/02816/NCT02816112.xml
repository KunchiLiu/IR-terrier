	<brief_summary>Taxotere-cyclophosphamide ( TC ) chemotherapy commonly use adjuvant chemotherapy regimen patient resect early stage breast cancer . TC chemotherapy cause febrile neutropenia ( FN ) serious associate treatment delay dose reduction , thereby compromise treatment efficacy . To reduce risk chemotherapy-induced FN , TC administer either one two highly effective standard treatment ; namely primary prophylaxis either ciprofloxacin granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . However , considerable cost difference strategy ; subcutaneous daily G-CSF cost least $ 12,000 4 cycle treatment oral ciprofloxacin cost $ 100 . The investigator therefore perform feasibility study explore whether `` integrated consent model '' involve oral consent feasible practice ; whether use increase number physicians patient take part clinical trial . This feasibility study ( REaCT-TC NCT02173262 ) amaze success investigator therefore perform definitive study compare G-CSF ciprofloxacin . This study evaluate feasibility endpoint , rather clinically important endpoint hospitalization febrile neutropenia rate .</brief_summary>
