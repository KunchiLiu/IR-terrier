A sample 138 participant calculate base morbidity diabetic foot ulcer , account estimate 10 % attrition rate . The glycemic control important validity study result . A specific team endocrine doctor manage blood glucose participant two group within range 7-10 mmol/L . Participants allocate MDT group CDT group randomly accord random number table . For MDT-participants , bio-bags contain sterilize , live , medicinal Lucilia sericata larva place wound ulcer . For CDT-participants , conventional dressing ( disinfect iodophor , dress gauze ) perform ordinally . Every 3 day procedure two group perform wound assessment do wound closure achieve . The wound assessment , include measurement area wind surface bacterial culture , perform specific team microsurgical doctor . The outcome measure include wound heal time ( day ) time negative bacterial culture occur ( day ) .
