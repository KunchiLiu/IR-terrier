	<detailed_description>The objective examine weather protein supplementation able affect inflammatory response well recovery muscle performance follow intense eccentric exercise protocol . In double-blind , counterbalance design , 14 men receive either Placebo ( PLA ) milk protein isolate ( PRO ) 8 consecutive day follow single bout exercise ( 300 eccentric contraction 30 deg/sec ) . In condition , performance assess baseline , immediately post-exercise , 2h post-exercise daily 8 consecutive day . Blood sample collect baseline , 2h post-exercise daily remain 8 day . Muscle biopsy vastus lateralis collect baseline well day 2 day 8 post-exercise period .</detailed_description>
