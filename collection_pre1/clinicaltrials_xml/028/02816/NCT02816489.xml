	<brief_title>Labial Alveolar Bone Thickness Apical Root Resorption Changes Associated With Self-ligating Versus Conventional Brackets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Labial alveolar bone thickness apical root resorption change associate self-ligating versus conventional bracket . Protocol submit partial fulfillment requirement Master Degree Orthodontics . The initial stage treatment crowd permanent teeth orthodontically worry teeth leveling alignment . The accuracy procedure depend various variable . Friction generate upon materialistic composition different bracket archwire type , technique ligature . Several self-ligating bracket grow since 1935 . Self-ligation n't need elastomeric attachment catch archwire , relate highly reduce friction many different type archwires , therefore less force require . It valuable evaluate appliance system capability align teeth minimal injurious effect oral tissue . The aim study compare labial alveolar bone thickness apical root resorption change associate self-ligating versus conventional bracket . Subjects method Study design : Randomized control clinical trial Study set population : The sample study consist twenty one patient select Outpatient Clinic , Orthodontic Department , Faculty Dentistry , Mansoura University . Interventions : The patient divide randomly two group treat separately follow : - Group I : treat use passive self-ligating ceramic orthodontic bracket stainless steel archwire slot liner . - Group II : treat use conventional stainless steel orthodontic bracket ligate elastomeric ligature . The patient treat orthodontically within initial level alignment 6 month duration begin sequence 0.014 , 0.016 , 0.016 × 0.022 inch nickel-titanium archwires 0.016 × 0.022 inch stainless-steel archwire . Each archwire remain 1.5 month , replace previously mention sequence . For group II , archwires attach bracket use elastomeric ligature . CBCT obtain two time interval , begin orthodontic treatment 6 month . Dental strip extraction premolar eliminate . Records : For patient follow record take leveling alignment : 1 . Standardized upper low study cast . 2 . Standardized periapical radiograph . 3 . Standardized extra-oral intra-oral photograph . 4 . Standardized cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) . Observations : Sagittal cut upper low incisor center long axis select . The labial alveolar bone thickness ( LABT ) incisor determine site neighbor wide point labiopalatal root two level separate 3 mm ( L1 L2 , respectively ) ; level set along long axis incisor locate every 3 mm cementoenamel junction ( CEJ ) level . Labial alveolar bone thickness assess cervical level ( L1 ) midroot level ( L2 ) T0 T1 . Furthermore , apical root resorption ( ARR ) calculate determine difference total tooth length , measure millimeter incisal border root apex , T0 T1 ( T1-T0 ) . Ethical consideration : All patient receive information future clinical trial study give consent signing informed consent . Data management analysis : All statistical analysis perform SPSS software . Differences consider significant P value less 0.05 .</detailed_description>
