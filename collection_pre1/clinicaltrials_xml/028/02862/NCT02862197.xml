	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether invasive pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) monitoring could beneficial patient dialysis treatment . Ten implantable pressure sensor ( CardioMEMS Â® ) implant PAPs individual participant record routine dialysis treatment session . This exploratory pilot study , major interest lie value change PAP relation hemodynamic parameter among patient dialysis treatment . Implanted device monitor patient without effect actual treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Invasive Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure ( PAP ) Among Dialysis Treated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dialysis treatment hemodynamically problematic one third patient . Particularly , estimation adequate fluid removal dialysis difficult . Removing much fluid lead dehydration , hypotension dizziness , insufficient removal lead fluid accumulation worsen possible heart failure . Both under- overestimation fluid removal connect increased mortality . Balancing fluid balance especially challenging patient simultaneous heart failure . Several measure make precaution take dialysis optimize ultrafiltration individually patient . The key question estimation right amount ultrafiltration , much speed fluid safely remove patient without critically lower fill preload heart . The result CHAMPION trial show therapy guide PAP superior conventional way estimate optimal fluid balance among heart failure patient . Compared heart failure patient CHAMPION trial , ESRD patient share similarity . In group , estimate fluid balance crucial , difficult . The change fluid balance among ESRD patient much large . In present study investigator aim evaluate potential invasive measure PAP context dialysis treatment patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . After implantation basic medical history take , echocardiography make , laboratory measurement record . Participants monitor routine dialysis treatment twice week period 1 month . In addition twice day measurement record home study . PAP measure change compare haemodynamical data available include blood volume , systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , hematocrit measure bioimpedance measurement dialysis treatment .</detailed_description>
