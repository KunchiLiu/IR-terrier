	<brief_summary>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia common malignancy child . Current therapeutic strategy allow heal 80 % child . However treatment associate toxicity , mortality 1-2 % . The frequent complication , occur treatment initiation , thromboembolic complication . The commonly accepted explanation anti-thrombin depletion chemotherapy use treatment , L-asparaginase . But anti-thrombin supplementation show efficacy prevention thromboembolic complication . Therefore author consider multifactorial mechanism behind event , involve treatment malignant cell . The interaction two factor participate damage vascular endothelium . The microparticles membrane fragment derive bud membrane activate cell apoptosis . Their thrombogenic role link expression coagulation activator tissue factor . It also associate role modulation signal pathway involve invasiveness angiogenesis endothelial cell . In acute lymphoblastic leukemia , presence role microparticles study . Our hypothesis production microparticles upon lysis blast upon activation endothelial cell induce induction therapy , participate procoagulant phenotype .</brief_summary>
