	<detailed_description>Although papillary follicular thyroid cancer low-grade endocrine malignancy , fatal cancer cell poorly-differentiated anaplastic change . Prior research indicate one-third well-differentiated thyroid cancer could transform poorly-differentiated pattern , even anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC ) , fatal malignancy , effective therapeutic strategy note , include surgical intervention , chemotherapy radiotherapy . The poorly-differentiated anaplastic change thyroid cancer cell proliferate rapidly always invade local tissue distant metastasis . Cellular de-differentiation pivotal cause malignant transformation invasion . De-differentiation usually papillary thyroid cancer follicular thyroid cancer , definitely ATC . The Poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer cell rapidly proliferate metastasize . The poorly-differentiated tumor cell lose apoptotic mechanism de-differentiation , phenomenon fatal patient . The investigator start research thyroid cancer since 1999 , investigator initially find TNF-α could induce cyto-morphological re-differentiation thyroid cancer cell . Later , investigator find Lovastatin could induce re-differentiation anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC ) cell 25μM , induce apoptosis 50μM , 2001 . In 2006 , investigator design nude mouse model , find tumor shrink via treatment Lovastatin 5 10 mg/kg/day , tumor proliferate significantly 1 mg/kg/day . The investigator call phenomenon `` Duality effect '' statin . In 2012 , investigator find FLOT1 transketolase ( TKT ) important regulatory factor re-differentiation proliferation ATC cell , respectively . The investigator also find inhibition Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( CD26 ) influence proliferation ATC cell . Exosomes nanovesicels secrete extracellular environment . A grow evidence suggest theat exosomes could use biomarkers diagnosis prognosis malignant tumor . Exosomes 50-100 nm diameter , correspond intrluminal vesicle endosomal multivesicular body . Because cellular orgins , exosomes specific protein marker , like CD63 , CD9 , CD81 heat shock protein ( HSP ) . Urine use biosamples past five year baldder cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer ovarian cancer . Urine sample usually easy obtain non-invasive . Exosomes secrete cell could micro-molecularly transfer message cell biological marker cancer . The investigator find Vildagliptin Lovastatin could influence tumor cell survival via exosomal protein . For patient thyroid cancer , investigator could obtain urine sample without invasive procedure . Furthermore , investigator could find biological marker therapeutic target via exosomal expression urine . On continue basis ATC cell culture experiment , investigator expect enroll 30 patient papillary , follicular anaplastic thyroid cancer , collect urine sample operation , immediately operation , post-operative 3 , 6 12 month . The investigator analyze urine exosomal protein probable biological marker . The investigator hope find prognostic biological marker via prospective study . The investigator hope find newly therapeutic mechanism medication patient poorly-differentiated anaplastic thyroid cancer .</detailed_description>
