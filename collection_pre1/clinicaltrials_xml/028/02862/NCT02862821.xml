	<detailed_description>Internet game major risk vulnerable term risk dependence , emergence psychiatric disorder , financial consequence , family . Addictions game France represent 1 2 % general population . Online poker happen specific form gamble fast grow online game . If vulnerability factor report many study , date biomarkers screen people risk available . One favorite way biomarker research concern impair decision-making capacity biomarkers . In previous work , investigator show decision strongly link motivation impair decision-making capacity would associate motivational dys-regulation ( Giustiniani et al. , 2015 ) . The search biomarkers parallel motivation decision make essential yet day nonexistent literature . Here , subject addict online poker , behavioral protocol develop measure motivation pathological population ( Effort-Expenditure Rewards Task , EEfRT ) use specifically adapt studied functional neuroimaging . The main objective identify alteration motivational process related decision make condition uncertainty associate gamble addiction . For purpose , dynamic brain system involve decision make motivation study . As secondary objective , correlation neural activity performance different test use measure decision making ( Iowa Gambling Task IGT ) motivation ( EEfRT ) evaluate . Finally influence motivation level performance score decision make task evaluate , goal development optimal strategy term prevention . The study conduct University Hospital Besancon 36 month 73 participant : The experiment involve three stage : - stage 1 : validation HR-EEG adaptated motivation EEfRT task adaptated HR-EEG 20 healthy volunteer . - stage 2 : identification biomarkers 20 addict online poker gambler 20 non-addict online poker gambler - stage 3 : validation previously identify biomarkers 13 online poker gambler recruted poker forum . All stage progress accord plan : - Standardized questionnaire define socio-demographic data , diagnosis gamble addiction ( ICJE criterion ( Indice Canadien fu Jeu Excessif ) , screen comorbidities addictive , level anxiety impulsivity . - Registration brain activity ( randomisation ) : performance task motivation evaluation laboratory ( EEfRT ) adaptated high-resolution electroencephalography AND laboratory task assess decision make condition uncertainty ( IGT ) version high-resolution electroencephalography already validate previous study ( Giustiniani et al. , 2015 ) . Statistical analysis aim compare average activation difference two population functional neuroimaging examination . Then subject-by-subject analysis brain activation conduct look correlation various examination strength neuronal response . Following study , result allow u identify biomarkers addiction help improve vulnerable population screen capability tailor prevention strategy . Furthermore identification specific neural correlate dependence adapt therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
