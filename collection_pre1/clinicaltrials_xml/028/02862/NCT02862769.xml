	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate impact intravenous lidocaine acute chronic post surgical pain patient undergoing video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) . The investigator believe systemic administration lidocaine perioperative period would effective prevent chronic pain post VATS . In addition chronic pain investigator believe reduce acute postoperative pain well patient total opioid requirement.The investigator believe significant impact care patient present VATS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-operative Lidocaine Infusion Preventing CPSP Post VATs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It surprising complication related surgical procedure occur . Chronic Post Surgical Pain ( CPSP ) consider one common surgical complication , despite advance understand acute pain development new modality pain management 1 . Chronic Post Surgical Pain define Macrae Davies 7 persistent pain , exist minimum two month follow surgical procedure . The condition pre-existence pain , cause pain surgery exclude . Thoracic surgeries include thoracotomy video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) high risk procedure often lead CPSP . The prevalence chronic pain VATS close thoracotomy ( 25-47 % ) , half neuropathic pain A , B . Because fact chronic pain major physical mental health care problem affect patient community general , become essential physician prevent development chronic pain 8 . While multimodal analgesia largely replace pain mono-therapy opioids , remain commonly use medication treat post operative pain . Lidocaine amide local anesthetic use intravenously demonstrate significant analgesic , anti-hyperalgesic anti-inflammatory property . It also reduce sensitivity activity spinal cord neuron , decrease N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor mediate post-synaptic depolarization . The analgesic effect systemic lidocaine first test chronic neuropathic pain result support usage drug . Perioperatively , lidocaine administer continuous infusion clinically relevant dos ( 1-2 mg/kg/hr ) result plasma concentration 5Âµg.mL-1 . At plasma level , adequate attenuate sympathetic response , decrease pain demonstrate significant opioid spar effect . Perioperative lidocaine administration associate decreased incidence CPSP associate neuropathic pain . It reduce CPSP mastectomy 40-50 % 3 6 month follow-up . To best knowledge study address usage lidocaine VATS thoracotomy .</detailed_description>
