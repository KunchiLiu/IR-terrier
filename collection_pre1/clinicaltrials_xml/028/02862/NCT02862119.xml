	<brief_summary>Background : The best strategy ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient multi-vessel disease , undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) infarct-related artery ( IRA ) acute phase remain multivessel disease , still well establish . Current guideline recommend PCI infarct relate artery ( IRA ) . However , recent small scale randomise controlled trial indicate full revascularization non-infarct related artery index procedure superior initial conservative treatment . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) , method use determine ischemia-inducing lesion , show superior angiography-guided PCI stable angina . Objective method : To test hypothesis strategy systematic complete revascularization FFR-guided PCI follow STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI lead improved clinical outcome one year compare initial conservative management non-culprit lesion . The trial prospective international multicentre registry-based randomize control trial combine primary endpoint all-cause mortality non-fatal MI one year . Key secondary endpoint unplanned revascularization . 4052 patient acute STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI multi-vessel disease Sweden , Denmark , Norway , Finland , Iceland , Latvia Poland randomize 2 arm : 1 . FFR-guided PCI non-culprit lesion index hospital admission 2 . Initial conservative management follow acute PCI culprit lesion ( ) Randomization data collection registry - Swedish Coronary Angiography Angioplasty Registry ( SCAAR ) correspond registry country ( electronic data capture ) - ensure low bias , high inclusion rate excellent follow-up event low cost . Adjudication clinical event collection data registry include death cause registry also plan . Significance : If study show FFR-guided PCI non-culprit lesion STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI improve clinical outcome compare conventional management change practise best manage patient .

	<detailed_description>Background Information : Early epicardial coronary reperfusion prerequisite effective salvage ischemic myocardium reduces morbidity mortality patient ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . The recent ESC guideline currently recommend percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) infarct relate artery ( IRA ) set acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Subsequent management residual disease initially conservative low threshold non-invasive investigation residual ischemia . There recent meta-analysis 34279 patient 1819 cardiovascular death register follow-up showing PCI culprit lesion associate reduced mortality compare full revascularization time STEMI multivessel disease . Also non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , strategy multivessel PCI suitable significant stenoses—rather PCI limit culprit lesion—has evaluate appropriate , randomized fashion accord European Society Cardiology guideline myocardial revascularization . In NSTEMI grow evidence suggest benefit invasive strategy within 2 h patient high risk profile accord ESC NSTEMI guideline . Accordingly , also patient high risk NSTEMI require urgent revascularization may include current study . Recent small scale randomise control trial ( RCT ) however produce result suggest case anatomically significant non-culprit multi-vessel disease full revascularization non-infarct related artery index procedure least hospitalization superior initial conservative treatment . Since study small also go earlier observational study current guideline therefore difficult draw conclusion treat patient group optimal way reduce mortality . By way paradox , recent year show fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) use determine ischemia-inducing lesion superior angiography guide PCI stable angina NSTEMI . Whether perform full revascularization physiologically significant non-culprit lesion patient STEMI improve outcome compare initial conservative approach know . The primary PCI multivessel disease study ( PRIMULTI ) small study ( 650 patient ) investigate question combine primary endpoint cause death , myocardial infarction revascularization one year . In PRIMULTI conservative treatment safe ; difference regard death myocardial infarction , revascularization . One critique study include revascularization primary endpoint expect increase revascularization leave significant stenosis untreated . The key question complete revascularization prevents death MI . Therefore , aim study investigate whether patient STEMI/rescue PCI/risk evaluation follow successful thrombolysis/very high risk NSTEMI FFR-guided PCI non-culprit lesion index hospital admission improve cardiovascular outcome compare initially conservative approach non-culprit lesion . The study aim power statistically combine primary endpoint total mortality myocardial infarction ( MI ) minimum follow-up 1 year ( event last patient 1 year ) . Assessments Procedures : All patient undergo primary PCI accord clinical routine patient STEMI/Rescue PCI/Risk evaluation follow successful thrombolysis/very high risk NSTEMI . If index procedure PCI perform oral informed consent study obtain patient randomize follow PCI culprit lesion . A simple randomization procedure base computer module perform via SCAAR registry ( Sweden ) . Other participate country without possibility randomize patient registry web page . It strongly recommend randomization do directly follow primary PCI culprit lesion . However , possible randomize patient within 6 h puncture time index procedure . The patient receive write information study sign consent form ward PCI procedure perform . Follow-up treatment arm : If patient follow-up found angina pectoris could medically manage , recommend imaging-based non-invasive stress test perform decide new elective coronary angiography accord current guideline . If patient group find sign significant ischemia stress-test still significant angina send elective coronary angiography , FFR allow accord current ESC guideline stable coronary artery disease discretion patient responsible physician . However , recommend non-invasive stress test perform first option patient come back angina . Patients eligible randomize study follow registry endpoint . Data collect patient hospitalization myocardial infarction The Swedish Web-system Enhancement Development Evidence- base care Heart disease Evaluated According Recommended Therapies ( SWEDEHEART ) registry ( Sweden ) correspond registry country . Data also collect Swedish Coronary Angiography Angioplasty Registry ( SCAAR ) Sweden correspond registry country . Data coronary-artery bypass surgery index procedure determine diagnose registry CABG registry Sweden . For deceased patient data cause death collect Swedish Death Cause Registry . Corresponding registry country also use possible . Other participate country must decide possibility capture registry data correspond registry accord data model study . If possible data must collect manually UCR EDC system mirror interface registry use Sweden . Treatment assignment : Randomization ( 1:1 ) perform mean online randomization module within SCAAR registry use permuted block randomization stratify site . In participate country randomization perform corresponding registry web page . Intention-to-treat analysis perform primary analysis . A research nurse site contact patient perform medical record review 30 day one year confirm patient experience anything follow : MI , unplanned rehospitalization due anything follow : revascularization , major bleed require transfusion surgery , stroke heart failure . Furthermore , Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7 use evaluate effect angina pectoris . A majority patient age &lt; 75 year study clinical follow-up visit one year Cardiology nurse . This accord clinical routine patient Sweden age &lt; 75 year . At visit quality life parameter ( EQ-5D ) enter Swedish quality registry secondary prevention accord clinical routine . The data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) possibility stop enrolment due perceive increased risk patient FFR-group . No follow-up adverse event plan .
