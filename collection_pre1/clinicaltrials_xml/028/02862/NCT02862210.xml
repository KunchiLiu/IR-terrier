	<brief_summary>Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) progressive neurodegenerative illness affect frontal anterior temporal lobe brain . Changes behavior , include agitation , aggression , repetitive behavior , common symptom FTD . The investigator currently good medication treat symptom FTD , medication investigator use often side effect . In project , investigator test use low-dose lithium , compare placebo pill , treatment behavioral symptom FTD . Lithium greatly reduce behavioral symptom bipolar disorder , many find low-dose lithium well-tolerated patient dementia . Lithium appear inhibit creation protein involve many case FTD call tau .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Lithium Treatment Behavioral Symptoms Frontotemporal Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral symptom Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) , include agitation , aggression , inappropriate repetitive behavior common , distress patient caregiver , often lead institutionalization , difficult expensive treat . There dearth medication treat symptom FTD . Typically , antidepressant antipsychotic medication prescribe - low efficacy , latter class , carry serious adverse effect parkinsonism increase cardiovascular-related mortality . The investigator propose study efficacy lithium carbonate compare placebo treatment agitation , aggression , inappropriate repetitive behavior 60 patient FTD randomize , double-blind , two-arm parallel 12-week trial . Lithium highly effective treatment mania symptom agitation aggression bipolar disorder . It also inhibit tau aggregation phosphorylation , lead considerable interest use disease-modifying treatment tauopathies FTD Alzheimer 's disease . Unfortunately , early trial use typical dos ( i.e. , dose prescribed treatment bipolar disorder ) show high incidence serious adverse effect ( include confusion delirium ) . For study propose study investigator : 1 ) use lower dos low target serum concentration precede trial ( show preliminary data Columbia study data labs well-tolerated ) 2 ) target behavioral symptom rather cognitive outcome .</detailed_description>
