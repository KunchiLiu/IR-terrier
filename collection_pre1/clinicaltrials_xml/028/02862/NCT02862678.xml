	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma frequent . The chemoradiotherapy protocols part reference treatment locally advanced stage tumor . Diffusion-weighted MRI ( DW-MRI ) non radiate imaging , require injection gadolinium , give information tumor activity , base brownian motion water molecule . The difference motion express apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . The ADC variation reflect change water molecule motion redistribution intra- extracellular compartment . Several study show malignant lesion ADC coefficient lower compare benign lesion .</brief_summary>
