	<brief_title>Introducing Fetal Scalp Stimulation Adjunct Intermittent Auscultation Low-Resource Settings .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Each year estimate 2.6 million stillbirth occur globally . Nearly half , 1.2 million , occur intrapartum additional 650,000 child bear alive die soon birth due birth asphyxia cause hypoxia labor . The vast majority death occur low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) . In high-income country , obstetric provider utilize electronic fetal monitoring ( EFM ) monitor fetuses labor , controversy surround implement technology LMICs . What observe EFM pattern teach u fetuses respond scalp stimulation rise heart rate essentially guarantee well oxygenate . This physiologic phenomenon , know fetal scalp stimulation test ( FSST ) , potential improve fetal monitoring LMICs , never study use Doppler technology . This study aim collect information prevalence fetal distress obstetric referral hospital , test sensitivity specificity FSST Doppler device , collect pilot data use FSST adjunct improve fetal monitoring . The outcome study would identify trend cesarean delivery rate reduction , intrapartum stillbirth , birth asphyxia . The vast majority acute intrapartum-related morbidity mortality occur low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) care mother fetuses labor remains study understanding implement evaluate program address delivery quality care . Providing safe effective obstetric care require development process appropriate clinical setting consider resource , burden disease , cultural factor well implement process effective way become standard practice time . Internationally midwives employ intermittent auscultation ( IA ) monitor fetuses Pinard stethoscopes Doppler device . In high-resource setting provider rely computerized electronic fetal monitoring ( EFM ) identify sign fetal acidosis , although show superior IA . Recently , Federation International Gynecology Obstetrics publish recommendation adjunctive test fetal monitoring , recommendation limit high-resource EFM paradigm . On subject , expert fetal physiology Nigeria state , `` imperative appropriate diagnostic management modality fetal hypoxia available accessible . This way burden perinatal morbidity mortality reduce . '' Currently , fetal scalp stimulation ( FSST ) low-cost , validate , adjunctive test could use end majority world , study purpose . STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Tanzania rank 9th bad country stillbirth globally experience 47,100 loss 2015 . Fetal monitoring Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center ( KCMC ) Moshi , Tanzania , countless labor ward around world , limited inability accurately identify fetal acidosis labor patient . Misdiagnosis lead either excess cesarean delivery ( CD ) excess asphyxiate birth . The study hypothesis implement fetal scalp stimulation test ( FSST ) labor protocol reduce CD rate improve neonatal outcome lead reduction maternal neonatal mortality . Proving require large randomized-controlled trial ( RCT ) . The necessary first step proof-of-concept , feasibility study provide pilot data inform future effort .</detailed_description>
