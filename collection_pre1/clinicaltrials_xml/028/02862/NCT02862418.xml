	<brief_summary>This research study 2 purpose : 1 . To learn new way use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) take clear picture lung . A type MRI call Ultra Short Echo Time ( UTE ) use well traditional MRI . 2 . To collect image health information lung different kind lung disease compare healthy lung . This collection help researcher clinicians good understand lung variation health disease . This study involve one MRI session take 10 30 minute participant breathe test measure well lung work . This test call spirometry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Lungs With New Type Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Called UTE ( Ultrashort Echo Time )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial , obstructive , rare lung disease pulmonary disorder comprise 300 disease entity poorly understood , diagnose , treat . X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) image gold standard current clinical practice image lung structure function patient . Recent advance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pulse sequence hardware ultra short echo time ( UTE ) enable MRI lung anatomy nearly comparable CT without risk ionize radiation . The overreach goal study : 1. allow technical development validation UTE MRI sequence image alternative CT well future diagnostic tool , 2. allow preliminary UTE data generation healthy various disease population . We anticipate particularly important data child variability great due normal variation size , age maturity well distinctive difference expression lung diseases pediatrics versus adult population . This prospective , control study technical development validation UTE MRI techniques normal disease cohort . This study use standard MRI hardware ( FDA approve coil magnet ) develop refine technique use MRI sequence obtain UTE image . This refinement include vary MRI setting maximize image signal , control image contrast , develop software need acquire specialized image purpose improve imaging lung . The data also use collect normative data comparison lung pathology . Subjects may enroll ( separate consent ) . For subject MRI information may use generate data in-subject temporal variability healthy control disease group .</detailed_description>
