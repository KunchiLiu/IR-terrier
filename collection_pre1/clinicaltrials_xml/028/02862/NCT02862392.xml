	<detailed_description>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) tridimensional spine deformation affect 2 % subject 10 16 years-old predominant among girl . It severe , progressive multifactorial disease , genetic origin currently admit . AIS progressive ( 3 10 case ) scoliosis radiographic frontal angle ( Cobb angle ) strictly increase 5째 diagnosis date end growth . This progression severe require heavy treatment ( corset , surgery ) generate adverse effect ( spine pain , cardio-respiratory functional consequence walk ) . The lack reliable criterion predict evolution AIS real problem therapeutic decision impact socio-economic cost disease . Several study show orthostatic postural control anomalies AIS . The orthostatic postural control elaborate central integration different sensorial signal ( visual , somesthesic vestibular ) . Posturography , computerized integrate force plate , allow quantify sensorial component orthostatic postural control . This technique confirm disorder orthostatic postural control AIS , parameter use evaluate precision progressive potential . The posturographic signal analysis could lead implementation therapeutic strategy adapt progressive risk . Moreover , method could prevent progression major scoliosis , limit use radiography , application constrain corset ( worn 23 hour day ) possibility heavy surgery ( extent arthrodesis ) . The hypothesis study progressive AIS characterize disorder orthostatic postural control . The analysis treatment posturographic signal computerize integrate force plate , couple clinical radiographic examination , could highlight predictive reliable factor moment diagnosis . Thus , could help clinician therapeutic approach , base postural control improvement ( individualized prescription kinesitherapy , good adaptation orthopedic treatment corset ) . This method non-invasive , without side effect , fast achievable routine care moment diagnosis AIS .</detailed_description>
