	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) autoimmune inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) . Clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) often sign multiple sclerosis term refers first episode neurologic symptom experience patient . Possible presentation CIS include optic neuritis , brain stem and/or cerebellar syndrome , spinal cord syndrome , occasionally cerebral hemispheric dysfunction . An accurate diagnosis time important people high risk develop MS encourage begin treatment order delay prevent second neurologic episode , therefore , onset MS . The innate adaptative immune system play important role pathophysiology MS , act interaction environmental , genetic , epigenetic factor . Epigenetic modification , DNA methylation histone modification , alter DNA accessibility chromatin structure , thereby regulate pattern gene expression . These process crucial normal development differentiation distinct cell lineages adult organism . Histone acetylation , family histone acetyl transferase ( HAT ) , consistently associate promote transcription . Deacetylation histones correlate CpG methylation inactive state chromatin . There 4 class histone deacetylase enzyme ( HDACs ) , member capable deacetylation histone and/or protein target . Acetylation homeostasis key regulator immune cell activation . Of note , potent histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) endow antiinflammatory neuroprotective property identify . Efficacy HDACi experimental model MS report consistently . This study could provide information mechanism involve .</detailed_description>
