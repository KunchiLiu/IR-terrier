	<detailed_description>All adult patient report Stony Brook Medical Center Emergency Department toothache assess inclusion criterion . Patients agree participate study meet study criterion ask rate pain use 11-item verbal numeric pain scale 0 10 , none bad . The patient randomize either two Percocet oral tablet ( acetaminophen 325 mg oxycodone 5 mg ) , single dose Bupivicaine ( root block maxillary teeth local infiltration mandibular teeth ) . The intervention give particular patient determine use randomization protocol describe Treatment Allocation . The patient stratify depend whether mandibular maxillary tooth pain order account difference outcome base method Bupivicaine administration ( local block maxillary teeth nerve block mandibular teeth ) . Half include patient maxillary toothache half mandibular toothache . Administration additional prescription recommendation give deem necessary dental resident attend physician ( antibiotic additional analgesic ) . Measures Outcomes Following administration treatment , patient ask rate pain verbal numeric pain scale every 5 minute 30 minute follow treatment . The pain injection also measure , immediately follow injection pain scale . If first 30 minute patient still require additional analgesia , analgesic intervention may give discretion dental resident attend physician . The primary outcome percentage patient significant pain relief end study period 30 minute . Patients whose pain reduce severe ( 7-10 ) mild ( 0-3 ) consider meaningful reduction pain . Secondary outcome absolute change pain severity 30 minute calculate subtract 30-minute pain score initial pre-treatment pain score well time 50 % reduction pain severity . At end trial patient satisfaction method analgesia measure 5 point Likert scale : extremely dissatisfy , dissatisfy , neither satisfy dissatisfy , satisfied , extremely satisfied . Patients also ask would choose treatment future toothache .</detailed_description>
