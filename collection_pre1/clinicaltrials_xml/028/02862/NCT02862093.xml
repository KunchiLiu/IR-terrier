	<detailed_description>The study include AUD patient . Patients enrol alcohol addiction unit Internal Medicine , Gastroenterology Hepatology Department Catholic University Rome , Italy , accord inclusion criterion . Screening collection medical history , physical , neurological psychiatric examination well laboratory test perform . Moreover , patient underwent baseline SPECT assessment striatal DAT availability use 123I-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β- ( 4-iodophenyl ) nortropane ( 123I-FP-CIT ) radiotracer . Subsequently , patient randomize two group ( match gender age ) computer program REAL deep rTMS SHAM . After weekly session deep rTMS four week , patient underwent clinical assessment screen phase second SPECT . Moreover , alcohol intake four week prior enrollment 4 week rTMS session assess Timeline Followback ( TLFB ) interview , instrument provide retrospective estimation number drink per drinking day , number drinking day , number abstinence day , number heavy drinking day total number drink .
