	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE I . Background End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) represent major problem public health , severe disease affect hundred million people world increase rapidly . It bring complex implication social economic structure every nation . Renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) standard choice treatment patient suffer ESRD include hemodialysis ( HD ) , peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) transplant . The National Center Chronic Disease Prevention Health Promotion estimate 2014 , 20 million people US may different level Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . According Fresenius Medical Care , information gather 150 country worldwide show number patient treat globally ESRD estimate 3,200,000 end 2013 , approximately 6 % growth rate , continue increase significantly high rate world population . Among patient , 2,522,000 undergoing dialysis treatment HD PD around 678,000 people live kidney transplant . The annual growth rate HD , PD transplant estimate around 6-7 % , 8 % 4-5 % respectively . Reported incidence ESRD across globe show important trend range 100 2,000 patient per million population ( pmp ) 2013 . Taiwan , Japan USA continue high rate 3170 pmp , 2,620 pmp 2,080 pmp respectively . It average 1,090 p.m.p . 28 country make European Union ( EU ) . From global view , dialysis patient allocate three major geographical region : USA , EU Japan . Around 44 % dialysis patient treat 30 country . Estimates Global Burden Disease ( GBD ) year 2000-2012 , conducted World Health Organization ( WHO ) , indicate kidney disease responsible 864,226 death ( 1.5 % total number global death ) 29,685,826 disability adjust life year ( DALYs ) lose , correspond 1.1 % global DALYs lose 2012 . In Malaysia , accord 22nd Report Malaysian Dialysis Transplant Registry ( MDTR ) 2014 , 6107 new HD case report represent acceptance rate 203 pmp new peritoneal dialysis case total 948 , represent acceptance rate 31 pmp 2014 . Overall , total number HD PD patient increase 31,497 3270 respectively , give prevalence rate 1046 pmp 109pmp respectively 2004 2014 . A total 3521 patient HD 494 PD report died 2014 . In addition , number dialysis centre whole Malaysia increase 205 2000 758 2014 give rate 13 pmp 2004 25 pmp 2014 . The increase dialysis centre mainly contributed private dialysis centre triple 6 pmp 2005 14 pmp 2014 . The 22nd MDTR report also state number new transplant patient 172 2005 decrease 81 ( 3 pmp ) 2014 . The reduction number new transplant mainly due reduction commercial transplantation perform overseas . The number function renal transplant increase 1716 2005 1907 2011 decline 1844 2014 . The Global Burden Disease Study ( GBD ) 2010 conduct Institute Health Metrics Evaluation ( IHME ) reveal among total number year life lose ( YLLs ) due premature death Malaysia , kidney disease rank 14th 25 cause death 62 YLL per thousand population account 1.1 % total premature death . Ischemic heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , low respiratory infection high rank cause 2010 . Besides , figure also show Malaysia rank 13th relative comparator country lead cause DALYs kidney disease 2010 1 best performance 15 bad . ESRD impose significant economic consequence term direct loss gross domestic product result management patient ESRD . The expenditure management patient ESRD develop country account 2-3 % total healthcare expenditure , ESRD patient represent 0.02-0.03 % total population . The United States Renal Data System report 2013 $ 30.9 billion medicare expenditure ESRD ( +1.6 % versus previous year ) ( USRDS 2015 ) . In National Health Service ( NHS ) England , annual spending kidney care estimate £445 million 2002 ( ∼£566 million 2009-2010 price ) programme budget analysis Department Health estimate total NHS expenditure kidney care , include CKD , £1.64 billion 2009-2010 . In Australia , kidney disease contribute substantially health care expenditure Australia increase much faster expenditure total health care . In 2004-2005 account 1.7 % total expenditure ( $ 898.7 million ) , increase 33 % since 2000-2001 ( $ 573.6 million ) . In Malaysia , accord report Malaysia National Health Accounts ( MNHA ) , Ministry Health , total health expenditure 4.49 % per GDP ( RM 42,256 mil ) 6.22 % General Government Health Expenditure ( GGHE ) percent General Government Expenditure ( GGE ) 2012 . Although limited data available ESRD CKD expenditure Malaysia , estimate cost dialysis 2005 report RM379.1 mil . NHMA ( 2013 ) report state , 2005 , total health expenditure 3.58 % per GDP ( RM 19,447 mil ) . II . Statement Problem The observed World Kidney Day annually begin March 2006 send clear message public , government health official , physician , ally health professional , patient , family 'CKD common , harmful , treatable ' . Renal replacement therapy available three different modality include haemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis kidney transplantation either live donor decease donor . Kidney transplantation offer nearly normal life , quality life survival , consider optimum treatment eligible patient . Despite renal transplant live donor , organ shortage remain worldwide problem produce increase wait list transplantation inevitable necessity dialysis treatment . According Electronic Malaysian Organ Sharing System ( eMOSS ) , around 19,500 people wait list kidney transplant Malaysia 31st May 2016 . New transplant rate Malaysia low 3 pmp 2014 . Hence , patient require dialysis therapy . There close 35,000 dialysis ( PD HD ) . As compare renal transplantation , dialysis less effective term 'survival ' 'quality life ' . In spite notable growth dialysis provision rate 10-fold 1993 2014 , Malaysia still incapable provide universal access RRT . The increased dialysis centre driven private dialysis centre almost triple 6 pmp 2005 14 pmp 2014 . Nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) centre increased 4 pmp 2005 5 pmp 2014 . In contrast , rate growth stagnant public sector , 5 pmp 2005 2014 . Most increases private dialysis centre occur economically develop west coast state Malaysian Peninsula . Public sector still provide dialysis centre economically disadvantage state . Moreover , prevalence ESRD expect rise significantly foreseeable future . Thus , sustainability dialysis therapy ( HD PD ) future uncertain . III . Justification ESRD chronic serious illness significant health consequence high-cost treatment option . Despite rise economic pressure collective health care system , cost effectiveness study manage ESRD treatment scarce country . An economic evaluation HD CAPD MOH hospital , Malaysia conduct 2005 include cost per life save . This study expand 2007 incorporate utility measure obtain cost utility HD PD . The measurement improvement quality life associate haemoglobin . In addition , worth note study perform base 2001 cost data . Obviously , cost treatment medical setting change tremendously accord current economic situation . For example , cost erythropoietin ( EPO ) adapt 2007 study earlier study large reduction price EPO , Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent ( ESA ) follow introduction EPO-β MOH early 2004 . As result , utilization rate ESAs increase 91 % patient HD 80 % patient PD 2013 compare 74 % patient HD 63 % patient PD 2004 . In regard utility score , also find quality life HD CAPD patient high international standard ( UK value set ) . Hence , Malaysian EQ-5D questionnaire value set produce use cost utility study . Given low organ donation rate continual global growth ESRD population , necessary important carry effectiveness evaluation HD PD term cost utility analysis expenditure management justify without compromise outcome . In economic evaluation study , choice perspective ( societal provider ) important effect cost-outcome component assess used evaluation . This study conduct Malaysia Ministry Health perspective . The information obtain may facilitate financial plan health policy decision Ministry Health regard health care allocation sustainable dialysis treatment program future . IV . Objective ( ) General Objective This study aim compare cost-utility HD CAPD Malaysian Ministry Health perspective estimate cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) . Specific Objectives 1 . To determine socio-demographic characteristic patient HD CAPD . 2 . To evaluate mean cost HD CAPD treatment . 3 . To determine life expectancy HD CAPD patient . 4 . To assess predict measured quality life ( QoL ) value HD CAPD patient use EQ-5D-3L questionnaire . 5 . To evaluate cost utility cost per QALY gain HD CAPD patient . 6 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness varying level PD use versus current practice use hypothetical cohort Markov model . METHODOLOGY I . Study design This study commence two phase . Phase 1 prospective multicentre study determine cost utility HD CAPD MOH perspective use activity base costing ( ABC ) step-down approach . Costs intervention ( HD CAPD ) obtain participate dialysis centre dialysis patient ' medical record . Health related quality life ( HRQoL ) utility score evaluate use EQ-5D-3L questionnaire . Data National Renal Registry ( NRR ) use estimate participate dialysis patient . The data collection period 1st October 2016 30th September 2017 . Phase 2 involves development hypothetical cohort Markov model use TreeAge software input earlier phase secondary data include transition probability incident dialysis patient evaluate cost utility varying level CAPD use versus current practice . Phase 1 Cost utility analysis sample data Stage 1 : Selection participate centre Stage 2 : Patient recruitment Stage 3 : Cost analysis Stage 4 : Measurement quality life Stage 5 : Measurement patient survival ( base secondary data NRR ) Stage 6 : Cost utility analysis Stage 7 : Sensitivity analysis Phase 2 Cohort Simulation Markov model Stage 1 : Development Markov Model use TreeAge Pro Software Stage 2 : Inputs cost health utility Stage 3 : Transition probability Stage 4 : Scenario analysis Stage 5 : Sensitivity analysis The sampling frame participate centre MOH state hospital HD PD unit submit patient ' data Malaysian National Dialysis Transplant Registry ( MDTR ) via National Renal registry ( NRR ) . The MDTR set 1992 collect data patient RRT . The registry function describe natural history ESRD , describe characteristic patient ESRD , management , patient ' survival treatment outcome ( NRR ) . Following inclusion exclusion criterion selection : I . Inclusion criterion - Centres commence operation 2011 . - Awarded compliance certificate contribute &gt; 80 % annual treatment return accord MDTR . - Possesses adequate clinical administrative data . ii . Exclusion criterion - Private NGO dialysis centre . - Centres less 50 CAPD 50 HD patient . - State hospital Sabah Sarawak due logistic reason . Following inclusion exclusion criterion , five state hospital select participate study use purposive sample include Hospital Kuala Lumpur Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah ( Central ) , Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan ( East ) , Hospital Sultanah Aminah ( South ) Hospital Pulau Pinang ( North ) . A purposive sampling use consider logistics problem , availability senior nephrologist become principal site investigator site , availability medical assistant nurse assist data collection approval respective site 's head department director . However , select hospital consider represent MOH dialysis centre since distribute across various geographical region except Sabah Sarawak ( Far East ) . III . Patient recruitment 180 dialysis patient ( 90 HD 90 CAPD ) include study . Patients sample use multistage random sample . Firstly , late master list patient select participate centre obtain NRR ( registered 2011 2015 ) accord inclusion exclusion criterion mention . Secondly , list separate accord HD CAPD centre sort ascend order base patient registered identification number database . Next , simple random sample apply select participate patient . Selected patient agree participate study ask read information sheet signing consent form . They withdraw point study . IV . Study tool The following form design used elicit information patient 's sociodemographic characteristic , commodity , baseline lab test , quality life/utility index , cost ( capital + recurrent ) : Form 1 : Patient Particulars resource utilization This form design collect patient 's sociodemographic characteristic age , gender , ethnicity , high education level average annual income commodity hypertension , cardiovascular disease anemia . Data relate vascular access surgery , medication , image , laboratory test , hospitalization , referral non-nephrology clinic patient status ( alive/dead/transplanted/withdrawn ) collect via form . Form 2 : Centre Costing Form This form design collect data capital cost dialysis centre include building cost , equipment/instrument use dialysis . Recurrent cost dialysis related consumables , staff salary consumables office stationery utility include water , electricity telephone usage collect via form .
