	<brief_summary>In complex cardiac surgery prolong cardiopulmonary bypass , allogeneic blood product transfusion often necessary control intraoperative postoperative bleeding . Furthermore , approximately 50 % patient undergoing cardiac surgery anemic surgery , patient normal hemoglobin level may become anemic and/or surgery . Perioperative transfusion carry risk far beyond transmission infection demonstrate associated adverse outcome related postoperative pulmonary complication , decrease renal function increase mortality . Thus , important blood conservation stratigies minimize transfusion increasingly emphasize . In recent trial Johansson colleague , conclude perioperative administration intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000 increase hemoglobin level prevent anemia 4 week cardiac surgery . Therefore , perioperative iron isomaltoside 1000 administration among patient undergo complex valvular heart surgery could reduce perioperative allogeneic transfusion also incidence postoperative adverse event . The aim study examine effect perioperative iron isomaltoside 1000 administration transfusion requirement patient undergo complex valvular heart surgery .</brief_summary>
