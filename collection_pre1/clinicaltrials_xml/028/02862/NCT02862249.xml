	<brief_title>Trial Faecal Microbiota Transplantation Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Humans colonize diverse range microbe , abundantly inhabit gastrointestinal tract anatomically commence oral mucosa , colonic lumen densely populate . The gut microbiota consist mainly bacteria , worth remember fungi , virus , archaea protozoa also resident active . As composite , micro-organisms outnumber human cell factor ten . Humans carry two kilogram microbe within gut , tens trillion micro-organism refer 'last human organ . ' Whilst microbe consist three million gene , impressive 150 time number contain within genome , two third entire gut microbiome unique individual . Furthermore although gut microbiome consist great 1,000 specie bacteria ; approximately 170 specie predominate give individual Bacteroidetes Firmicutes dominant phylum . The diverse complex role play gut microbiome include development modulation innate adaptive immune system ; locally within intestinal mucosa defense pathogens tumorigenesis , systemically . Dietary homeostatic function pertain biosynthesis vitamin , metabolism glucose , bile salt xyloglucans , liberation short-chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) otherwise indigestible dietary starch , mainly bacteria Bacteroidetes phylum . SCFAs immune-signaling anti-inflammatory property vital source energy intestinal mucosal cell help maintain intestinal integrity barrier function . A change gut microbiome therefore impact multitude vital homeostatic function , many human host perform independently . Technological advance genomic sequence bioanalytics begin revolutionize understanding gut microbiome relation hepatological disease . Further insight gain unravel complex mechanism contribute commensal synergistic interaction host microbiome , downstream mechanistic effect normal physiology process disturbed induce pathology . It well establish patient cirrhosis enteric dysbiosis small bowel bacterial overgrowth translocation bacteria product ( lipopolysaccharide bacterial DNA ) across permeable gut epithelial barrier exacerbate underlying portal hypertension endothelial dysfunction . This culminate systemic inflammation endotoxemia induces innate immune dysfunction via toll-like receptor signaling , predispose infection development decompensating complication haemorrhage , sepsis hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) . Indeed , widely recognise intestinal decontamination non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin effective treatment HE . This implicate gut dysbiosis ensue metabolic sequela involve intestinal absorption nitrogenous compound progression neurocognitive dysfunction . Enteric dysbiosis also link progression advance liver disease . Utilising quantitative metagenomics recently show 75,245 microbial gene differ abundance patient cirrhosis healthy individual , relevance 50 % taxonomically assign bacterial specie buccal origin suggest invasion gut mouth cirrhosis . Salivary dysbiosis , represent reduction autochthonous bacteria , also present extent reflect change see faecal microbiota cirrhosis , associate systemic salivary-specific inflammatory milieu . Of note salivary dysbiosis pronounce patient go hospitalized 90-day followup . This imply causative role particularly consider cirrhotic saliva enrich gene relate endotoxin synthesis protein , nucleic acid vitamin metabolism , latter purport modulate intestinal barrier integrity oxidative stress . Modulating gut microbiota patient cirrhosis non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin associate improved cognitive performance reduction endotoxemia patient cirrhosis . Moreover , investigator recently perform multicentre retrospective study include 170 patient rifaximin therapy give 90-days significantly ( ) reduce hospital re-admission rate 3 month treatment , impact significantly NHS resource burden ( ii ) reduce overall liver disease severity [ measure Child Pugh Model End Stage Liver Disease score raise possibility modulation gut microbiota may significantly modify natural history chronic liver failure . These data constitute investigator ' view `` proof principle '' modify gut microbiota patient cirrhosis improve clinical outcome . Rifaximin approve NICE prevention recurrence overt hepatic encephalopathy cirrhosis , considerable concern remain regard whether long term antibiotic prescription result change bacterial function virulence rather simple reduction bacterial population whether may drive bacterial resistance antibiotic already functional immunocompromised population . The question therefore raise whether directly , oppose indirectly modulate gut microbiota utilising faeces healthy donor may safer durable therapy . Faecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) well-established treatment stably modify gut microbiome show safe efficacious several disease state result gut dysbiosis include Clostrium difficile infection [ NICE approve ] inflammatory bowel disease . The investigator hypothesize patient advanced cirrhosis FMT may reduce progression chronic liver failure include jaundice , accumulation fluid within abdominal cavity , bleeding , encephalopathy development infection organ dysfunction . Whether FMT feasible set liver cirrhosis remain investigated . A trial propose determine whether FMT healthy donor patient advance cirrhosis feasible safe .</detailed_description>
