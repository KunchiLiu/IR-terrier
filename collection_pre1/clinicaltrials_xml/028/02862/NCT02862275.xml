	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Treating Patients With Cancer Following Adoptive Cell Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A ) administration patient receive adoptive cell transfer ( ACT ) within 6 month enrollment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate expansion engraft T cell follow atezolizumab administration peripheral blood within tumor microenvironment . II . To evaluate phenotype function engraft T cell follow atezolizumab administration . III . To observe record anti-tumor activity . IV . To evaluate response rate use immune relate Response Criteria ( irRC ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 , tumor-specific criterion . V. To evaluate survival outcome progression free survival use irRC RECIST v1.1 , tumor-specific criterion . OUTLINE : Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30- 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day total 17 dos 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , 8 week , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
