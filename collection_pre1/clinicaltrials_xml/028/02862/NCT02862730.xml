	<brief_summary>Closed-loop system emerge technology automate hormone delivery . They quickly pave way revolutionize treatment type 1 diabetes . Several category emerge : dual-hormone ( insulin glucagon ) closed-loop system closed-loop system insulin , one variety low glucose suspend safety feature available Medtronic ( MiniMed 530G Enlite ) . The study describe within protocol design test efficacy new closed-loop algorithm manage blood glucose people type 1 diabetes exercise . The new algorithm 3 mode : single hormone insulin mode , dual-hormone insulin glucagon mode insulin mode predictive low glucose suspend , exercise detection algorithm . The purpose study determine whether dual hormone AP exercise detection algorithm outperform single hormone AP low glucose suspend algorithm current care use subject 's insulin pump .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Four Way Crossover Closed Loop With Exercise Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo four approximately 84 hour study . The first day study approximately 12 hour inpatient visit include activity daily live exercise period 2 day spend outpatient . The subject come back research center fourth day complete another approximately 12 hour inpatient visit include activity daily live exercise period follow removal device . In randomized order , subject glucose control use follow system : 1 ) dual-hormone closed-loop system , 2 ) insulin closed-loop system , 3 ) predictive low glucose suspend system 4 ) current care subject use insulin insulin pump . Both closed-loop system algorithms exercise detection algorithm use inputs heart rate monitor accelerometer , Zephyrlife BioPatch . After exercise detection , insulin turn first 30 minute , total insulin infusion rate adjust exercise multiplier , dual-hormone system , target glucose glucagon increase along maximum dose glucagon allow . The predictive low glucose suspend system utilize patient 's optimized basal rate , correction factor , carb ratio . The patient bolus meal hyperglycemia usual PLGS , additional safety net pump suspend insulin predicts hypoglycemic event . The Dexcom CGM system Tandem : slim pump use three intervention visit . Subjects arrive CTRC 7am start intervention visit . Subjects eat breakfast , lunch dinner research center . Subjects eat breakfast 8:30am . After breakfast , subject complete activity daily live ( sit chair , lie bed , wash dish , sweeping floor , etc. ) . Subjects eat lunch 12pm . Subjects exercise 45 minute treadmill around 2pm . Subjects eat dinner 6pm discharge . The subject go home Day 2 Day 3 return Day 4 complete another 12 hour inpatient visit schedule activity identical Day 1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis type 1 diabetes mellitus least 1 year . Physically willing able perform 45 min exercise ( determined investigator review subject activity level ) Current use insulin pump . Lives another person age 18 old present subject exercise home attend train use system subject . Lives within 20 mile OHSU . A1C &lt; 10 % Willingness follow study procedure , include attend clinic visit . Willingness sign inform consent HIPAA document . Female childbearing potential pregnant intend become pregnant breastfeeding , use adequate contraceptive method . Acceptable contraception include birth control pill / patch / vaginal ring , DepoProvera , Norplant , IUD , double barrier method ( woman use diaphragm spermicide man use condom ) , abstinence . Any cardiovascular disease , define clinically significant EKG abnormality time screen history : stroke , heart failure , myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , coronary arterial bypass graft angioplasty . Diagnosis 2nd 3rd degree heart block nonphysiological arrhythmia judge investigator exclusionary . Renal insufficiency ( GFR &lt; 60 ml/min , use MDRD equation report OHSU laboratory ) . Liver failure , cirrhosis , liver disease compromise liver function determine investigator . Hematocrit le equal 34 % . Hypertensive subject systolic blood pressure &gt; = 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; = 100 mmHg despite treatment treatmentrefractory hypertension ( e.g . require four medication ) . History severe hypoglycemia past 12 month prior screen visit hypoglycemia unawareness judge investigator . Subjects complete hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire . Subjects exclude four R response . Adrenal insufficiency . Any active infection . Known suspected abuse alcohol , narcotic , illicit drug . Seizure disorder . Active foot ulceration . Severe peripheral arterial disease characterize ischemic rest pain severe claudication . Major surgical operation within 30 day prior screen . Use investigational drug within 30 day prior screen . Chronic usage immunosuppressive medication ( cyclosporine , azathioprine , sirolimus , tacrolimus ) . Bleeding disorder , treatment warfarin , platelet count 50,000 . Allergy aspart insulin . Allergy glucagon . Insulin resistance require 200 unit per day . Need uninterrupted treatment acetaminophen . Current administration oral parenteral corticosteroid . Any life threaten disease , include malignant neoplasms medical history malignant neoplasm within past 5 year prior screen ( except basal squamous cell skin cancer ) . Beta blocker nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker . Current use medication intend low glucose insulin ( ex . use liraglutide ) . Diagnosis pheochromocytoma , insulinoma , glucagonoma , personal family history multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) 2A , MEN 2B , neurofibromatosis von HippelLindau disease . History severe hypersensitivity milk protein . Current use medication strong anticholinergic property , antihistamine , sleep aid , antidiarrheal medication . Current use indomethacin . Conditions may result low level releasable glucose liver inadequate reversal hypoglycemia glucagon prolong fasting , starvation chronic hypoglycemia determine investigator . A positive response question Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire . Any chest discomfort physical activity , include pain pressure , type discomfort . Any clinically significant disease disorder opinion Investigator may jeopardize subject 's safety compliance protocol .</criteria>
