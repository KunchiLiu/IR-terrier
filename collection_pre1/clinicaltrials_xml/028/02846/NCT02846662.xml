	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic research clearly establish significant public health importance mental disorder low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) chronic nature . Among mental disorder , depression become major problem single condition , often , part complex clinical picture multiple condition risk factor combine . There substantial co-morbidity depression chronic physical condition , outcome condition impair co-morbidity . Most disease burden LA explain chronic disease , include depression , cardio-vascular disease -mostly hypertension related- diabetes . Despite public health impact depression , often go unrecognized untreated . One factor treatment gap lack financial human resource . The limited mental health resource available LMIC often optimally distribute either . Funds trained personnel typically allocate tertiary health care service , psychiatric hospital . Therefore , short- medium-term effort develop , evaluate , disseminate effective mental health intervention LMIC must adapt severe workforce , resource limitation , inequity . The mental health field need consider develop self-help automate intervention reach people health care provider . This partially addressed two strategy : 1 ) increase effective self-management ; 2 ) task-shifting role less specialized appropriately trained health worker . We conduct community cluster randomize trial individual chronic disease ( hypertension and/or diabetes ) symptom depression , attend primary care clinic São Paulo , Brazil . Participating clinic ( 20 ) randomly allocate nurse assistant trainned supervised monitor intervention base behavior activation ( experimental group ) deliver applicative smartphones ( CONEMO ) receive routine care ( control group ) . The focus project patient help use resource provide continuous advice , support , motivation . However , study suggest depressed patient leave alone device fail make good use self-help intervention . Nurse assistant assist participant web-based automate interface connect smartphone application ( CONEMO ) receive supervision task week . Method : CONEMO cluster randomize control trial conduct 880 chronic patient present diabetes and/ hypertension depression , receive health care 20 Primary Care Units Family Health Program Sao Paulo , Brazil . Of , half ( 10 ) deliver intervention CONEMO half ( 10 ) deliver usual care . The intervention , base behavior activation , deliver smartphone monitor health professional ( nurse assistant ) work primary care unit responsible care patient . The CONEMO intervention base behavior activation deliver applicative smartphones 3 time week 6 week , total 18 session . A nurse assistant mediates intervention , motivate patient monitoring his/her performance . Intensity depressive symptom suicidal ideation assess research assistant use PHQ-9 standardized protocol suicidal risk baseline , 3- 6-month follow-up . The primary outcome remission depressive symptom 3 month inclusion study . Secondary outcome include remission depressive symptom 6 month inclusion , social support , quality life , compliance medication , suicidal ideation activity perform . The effectiveness cost-effectiveness intervention assess intention-to-treat analysis , use clinical outcome assessment quality life ( EQ-5D ) 3 6 month inclusion trial use health service . Primary Outcome Measures : Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) score 3 month inclusion study . A 50 % reduction PHQ-9 score baseline consider success . Secondary Outcome Measures : Depression - Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , Quality life-EQD5 , Adherence medication-Morisky ; Social functioning- WHODAS , Daily activity ( BADS ) . Time Frame : 6 month inclusion study . A 50 % reduction PHQ-9 score baseline consider success . Cost effectiveness measure ( 3 6 month ) . Use health service medication . General Quality life ( EQ-5D ) . Process evaluation : Data collect interview participant Nurse Assistants CONEMO system .</detailed_description>
