	<brief_title>Implantation Venus P-Valve™ Pulmonic Position Patients With Native Outflow Tracts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate implantation Venus P-Valve™ treatment patient incompetent pulmonic valve , cause blood flow back pulmonary artery right heart ventricle pump heart ( pulmonary regurgitation ) . Patients without narrow ( stenosis ) right ventricular outflow tract include . The purpose protocol assess safety performance Venus P-Valve™ implantation . Post-procedure , clinical visit schedule 30 day , 6 month , 12 month , annually thereafter 3 year . Population : Patients≥12 year body weight ≥30kg , significant pulmonary regurgitation ( ≥3+ ) without right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT ) stenosis ( mean Doppler gradient ≥35mmHg ) native right ventricular outflow tract .</detailed_description>
