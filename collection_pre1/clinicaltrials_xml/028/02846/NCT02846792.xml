	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose plinabulin give together nivolumab see well work treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer come back spread place body . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , plinabulin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving nivolumab plinabulin together may work well treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Plinabulin Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV , Recurrent , Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination nivolumab plinabulin . ( Phase I ) II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) treatment nivolumab addition plinabulin treatment advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer second line set . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , duration response ( DOR ) overall survival ( OS ) patient treat nivolumab combination plinabulin . II . To determine safety tolerability combination plinabulin nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Patients pre-treatment and/or post cycle one biopsy flow cytometry tissue identify infiltration immune cell , rate expression program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) , program cell death 2 ( PD-2 ) program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study plinabulin follow phase II study . Patients receive plinabulin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
