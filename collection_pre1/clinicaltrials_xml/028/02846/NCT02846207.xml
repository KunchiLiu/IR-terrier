	<detailed_description>Cerebral infarction , ischemic stroke , common yet challenge illness four telltale sign ( high occurrence rate , high incapacitate rate , high mortality rate , high recurrence rate ) , pose threat man 's health life , also impose burden society love one . As , seek cure always hot topic field research . With regard illness ' high incapacitate recurrence rate , become apparent treatment method use recuperate stage stroke significant patient , allow chance regain health increase quality life . In Chinese medical term , pathogenesis key stroke deficiency vitals body couple superficiality extremity . As , recuperate stage stroke , lack Qi accompany blood stasis syndrome often observe . Hence , improve Qi promote blood circulation essential treatment . Research support treatment method highly effective treat cerebral infarction , mechanism involve still incomprehensible , largely due fact pathology cerebral infraction highly complicate , Chinese medicine multi-leveled , multi-channeled , multi-targets . To study relationship Qi blood cerebral infraction , patient recuperate stage deficiency Qi blood stasis underwent observation double blind clinical research . The patient sort random group : improve Qi group , promote blood circulation group , improve Qi promote blood circulation group , control group . Each group patient give standard Western medicine treatment , couple Chinese medicine treatment respect sort grouping . The treatment last 12 week 360 clinical case study . Testing method use include enzyme link immunosorbent assay , Western Blot , FQ RT-PCR , LC-MS , radiology . Through relation Neurotransmitter - endocrine hormone - immune cytokine network , blood rheology , vascular structure endothelial function , interaction involve vasoactive substance vascular endothelium blood cell , hop biological basis cerebral infraction 's deficiency Qi blood stasis syndrome decipher . This aid understanding whole process cause syndrome , decipher therapeutic mechanism involve treatment , well determine relationship Qi , blood blood vessel .</detailed_description>
