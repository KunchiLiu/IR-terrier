	<brief_summary>In traditional step-up approach , patient poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes instruct take 4 insulin injection daily multiple daily injection ( MDI ) advance therapy . However , significant number patient continue poor diabetes control . The common reason noncompliance multiple injection patient 's reluctance accept insulin-induced weight gain . More recently , algorithm diabetes management significantly change accommodate newer generation medication . Addition diabetes medication , induce weight loss oral Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 ( SGLT2 ) Inhibitors once-weekly glucagon-like peptide ( GLP ) -1 receptor agonist ( GLP1 RA ) injection , basal insulin recommend patient advance MDI . This approach work well patient since weight loss give patient extra motivation take medication regularly . Similarly , patient require take insulin injection meal throughout day approach . Unfortunately , still large number patient poor glycemic control still MDI . Some initiated MDI availability newer generation medication . Some start simply physician aware familiar new recommendation . Regardless reason , patient likely remain MDI despite chronic poor glycemic control since physician understandably reluctant step advance insulin therapy . In addition , data benefit safety stepping-down approach advance insulin therapy patient-friendly approach combine use oral SGLT2i once-weekly GLP1 RA injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomize , open-label , control , parallel-group trial plan . This study interdepartmental collaborative study among Department Internal Medicine , Department Family &amp; Community Medicine ( UCSF Fresno ) , Sierra Vista Family Medicine Residency Program Division Endocrinology . The study conduct follow multiple location order maximize patient recruitment : 1 . Internal medicine clinic Derian Koligian ambulatory care center ( ACC ) 2 . Family practice medicine clinic ACC 3 . Diabetes clinic ACC 4 . Internal medicine clinic University Medicine Associates East medical Plaza 5 . Endocrine clinic University Medicine Associates East medical Plaza 6 . Sierra Vista clinics The patient recruit first 12 month study predetermine sample size reach , whichever come first . The patient 's primary care provider inform enrollment study participant give permission . All participant group need make 3 visit UCSF Clinical Research Center 16- week period . ( 1 ) First visit : Once site co-investigators identify suitable interested study patient , train research coordinator contact patient first visit . The patient see UCSF Clinical Research Center research coordinator physician co-investigator . During first visit , patient group - give information study . - sign consent form . - randomly assign either treatment ( i.e . Step Down ) control ( MDI ) group use A Randomization Plan http : //www.randomization.com . - blood test A1c , CMP , CBC , fast lipid measurement body weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate . - complete Diabetes Medications Satisfaction ( DM-SAT ) Questionnaire form modify Morisky Medication Adherence Scale . Medication change first visit : In treatment group , 1 . All prandial insulin injection ( Humalog , Novolog , Apidra , Novolin R Humulin R ) , usually 3 time daily meal , discontinue . 2 . Basal insulin ( NPH , Lantus , Levimir , Toujeo Tresiba ) , usually daily bed time , continue 80 % home dose . The dose gradually increase patient back home dose ( dose patient take home prior enrollment ) fast BG 80-130mg/dl achieve use self-titration regimen . 3 . If patient pre-mixed basal+prandial insulin 2-3 time daily , discontinue basal insulin alone , ( NPH , Lantus , Levemir , Toujeo Tresiba ) , give 40 % total daily dose pre-mixed insulin . The dose gradually increase fast BG 80-130mg/dl achieve use self-titration regimen . 4 . Metformin , patient expect , continue , non-insulin oral medication diabetes discontinue . If patient metformin , Metformin ER start 500mg meal 2 week routine care 1000mg daily maintenance dose tolerate . 5 . Both SGLT2i GLP1 RA add metformin basal insulin . The patient trained injection technique once-weekly GLP1 RA , potential side effect , risk benefit new medication detail , hypoglycemia management self-titration regimen basal insulin . In control group , change MDI therapy , participant continue usual standard care primary care provider . The participant receive SGLT2i GLP1 RA study period . ( 2 ) Second visit : At 4 week patient start take new medication , patient make 2nd visit UCSF Clinical Research Center . During 2nd visit , patient treatment group - enquired side effect medication . - review insulin dose use self-titration regimen basal insulin . - blood test A1c , CMP , CBC , fast lipid measurement body weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate . - complete Diabetes Medications Satisfaction ( DM-SAT ) Questionnaire form modify Morisky Medication Adherence Scale . In control group , change MDI therapy , participant continue usual standard care primary care provider . The participant receive SGLT2i GLP1 RA study period . During 2nd visit , patient control group - blood test A1c , CMP , CBC , fast lipid measurement body weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate . - complete Diabetes Medications Satisfaction ( DM-SAT ) Questionnaire form modify Morisky Medication Adherence Scale . ( 3 ) Third visit : The patient make 3rd final visit UCSF Clinical Research Center 12 week 2nd visit 16 week date start SGLT2i GLP1 RA . During 3rd visit , patient group - blood test A1c , CMP , CBC , fast lipid measurement body weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate . - complete Diabetes Medications Satisfaction ( DM-SAT ) Questionnaire form modify Morisky Medication Adherence Scale . The investigator try make clinic appointment primary care provider one month prior last visit research center treatment group patient give permission . Therefore primary care provider able order medication patient 's health insurance plan patient wish remain study medication beyond study period . Alternatively , patient go back insulin therapy give prior study . Monitoring treatment group : The patient group monitor FPGs daily minimum . The research coordinator call participant group week 1 , 2 , 8 , 12 review fast glucose measurement , ask possible adverse event , incident hypoglycemia , change medication . All participant group group review UCSF Clinical Research Center week # 4 # 16 blood test physical examination . Outcome measurement : The primary outcome change A1c end 16 week study period secondary outcome change fast blood glucose , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , fast lipid , serum sodium potassium , serum creatinine , liver enzymes , CBC , medication adherence score treatment satisfaction score . These change compare two independent group , namely treatment group control group , also within group . Blood test questionnaire : The follow blood work drawn analyze community regional medical center baseline ( first visit ) , 4 week end study 16 week : 1 . A1c 2 . Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) differential 3 . Complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) 4 . Fasting lipid profile Patient satisfaction treatment group measure validated Diabetes Medications Satisfaction ( DM-SAT ) Questionnaire form . Patient adherence determine use modify Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ( MMAS-8 ) eight-item self-report measure adherence . SAMPLE SIZE AND ANALYSIS PLAN : The investigator attempt recruit consent 20 patient arm calculate provide 80 % statistical power 0.05 alpha continuous endpoint , two independent sample study . The calculation base following : A mean Hemoglobin A1c 8.5±1 % initiation study period . In treatment group anticipate decline Hemoglobin A1c 12-15 % end study period . The standard deviation mean A1c derive literature . The data analyze use SPSS software . Significance test conduct two-sided 5 % level . Continuous variable examine normality assumption meet , difference mean value test use Student 's test analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . If normally distribute , non-parametric procedure use , include Wilcoxan rank Sum test . Categorical data analyze use Fisher 's exact test Chi square analysis . Since before/after comparison also perform study patient utilize paired test McNemar 's chi-square test .</detailed_description>
