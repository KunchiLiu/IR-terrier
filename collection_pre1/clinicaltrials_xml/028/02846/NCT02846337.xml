	<brief_summary>Type 2 cardio renal syndrome define occurrence exacerbation kidney failure induce chronic heart failure . Sodium overload one main cause lead occurrence exacerbation syndrome . Some patient massive sodium retention medication effective enough . These patient therapeutic option refractory congestion 3-months mortality rate around 15 % , frequent rehospitalization ( 3-months rehospitalization rate 71 % ) excessively impaired quality life . For refractory heart failure cardio renal syndrome , nephrology department resort non-medication sodium extraction ( hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , isolated ultrafiltration ) . Between 2002 2008 , 927 French patient would start dialysis situation . In 2013 , 174 patient start dialysis 97 dialysis center . French National Authority Health recently publish new Good Practice Guidance thereupon , strengthen increase number publication widespread use technique . There therefore consensus among professional benefit technique indication . However , bibliographical data strong enough support strong level evidence . None foresight strategy compare others proper randomize controlled trial , clue suspect superiority one strategy another . So far , investigator propound invasive , expensive validate technique patient functional vital prognosis alter . The investigator think 's essential prove efficacy approach . They wish quantify technique impact rehospitalization , consideration potential survival impact . It seem unethical evaluate separate technique , take account patient severe heart failure switch one technique another among care . It therefore crucial validate benefit invasive procedure ( hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , isolated ultrafiltration ) compare medication-restricted care .</brief_summary>
