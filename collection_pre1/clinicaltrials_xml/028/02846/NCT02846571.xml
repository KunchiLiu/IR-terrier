	<brief_summary>The treatment trial consist intraocular islet transplantation . A single dose 1000 - 2000 Islet Equivalents ( IEQ ) /kg recipient body weight ( BW ) infuse anterior chamber eye self-sealing incision peripheral cornea . The procedure project take approximately 20-30 minute . Subject remain flat back 45-60 minute islet infusion maximize adhesion islet iris .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The impact Type 1 Diabetes . In U.S. alone , approximately 1.3 million people , include child adolescent , suffer type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) ; disease incidence increase many country , also child adolescent . Chronic autoimmune T cell response pancreatic ß-cells consider primary cause T1D , leading loss beta cell mass insulin secretion turn life-long dependence insulin injection . The disease severely impact quality life confers risk acute chronic complication link significant morbidity mortality , end stage renal disease , blindness , cardiovascular disease , diabetic ketoacidosis hypoglycemia . The economic burden cause T1D amount approximately $ 14.4 billion medical cost lose income . There significant need develop new therapy improve exist one prevent , treat , cure T1D . Diabetes socioeconomic impact primarily stem serious complication associate devastating disease . Such complication include blindness , amputation , kidney failure , heart vascular disease , stroke , nerve damage , even birth defect pregnancy . Although specific etiology T1D remain unknown , well establish T1D result autoimmune destruction insulin-producing beta cell endocrine pancreas ( i.e. , islet Langerhans ) . Consequently , treatment option T1D limit insulin supplementation . Insulin supplementation either form multiple insulin injection daily biological replacement insulin-producing beta cell provide natural source insulin . On one hand , conventional insulin supplementation via injection save countless life diabetic patient since discovery insulin early 1900s . However , well establish exogenous insulin injection therapy suboptimal prevent hyper hypoglycemia fluctuation . On hand , show even partial level endogenous insulin secretion protect chronic diabetic complication , hypoglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis , lead death . Therefore , beta cell replacement therapy transplantation isolate pancreatic islet offer great therapeutic option T1D . Several approach beta cell replacement pursue last decade . Regenerative approach regeneration exist mature beta cell , differentiation stem cell and/or trans-differentiation endocrine non-endocrine ( e.g. , ductal exocrine ) cell insulin-producing cell hold great promise treat T1D . However , approach yet materialize safe reliable clinical application . Transplantation also another option biological replacement limitation well . Limited availability donor tissue remain significant obstacle transplantation therapies general , include pancreatic islet . Other limitation transplantation therapy associate mandatory use systemic anti-rejection immunosuppressive drug . Chronic systemic immunosuppression expose transplant recipient serious potentially deadly side-effects complication increase susceptibility infections/sepsis cancer . Therefore , immunosuppressive agent continuously improve new one develop good protect transplant tissue ( e.g. , pancreatic islet ) reduce undesired side-effects systemic immunosuppression associate complication . T1D patient currently receive transplant therapy either form whole pancreas isolate pancreatic islet . On one hand , whole pancreas transplantation show achieve insulin independence T1D patient , also invasive associate high risk complication adverse event include mortality . On hand , transplantation isolate pancreatic islet minimally invasive significantly less complication compare whole pancreas transplant , survival islet graft might severely limited due complication associate current clinical transplant site , portal system liver . Nevertheless , hundred T1D patient receive islet transplant liver last two half decade clinical trial islet transplantation . These study demonstrate islet transplant recipient benefit improved glycemic control , reduce hypoglycemia episode , prevention diabetes-associated complication . This improve patient ' quality life significantly . Importantly , show transplanted T1D patient restore hypoglycemia awareness follow transplant maintain even patient get back insulin therapy due rejection loss islet graft . Therefore , transplantation isolate pancreatic islet emerge promising therapy T1D . Consequently , islet transplantation verge become standard-of-care United States country .</detailed_description>
