	<brief_title>Evaluation Patient Satisfaction Shade Matching Vita Suprinity Versus Lithium Disilicate ( E-max ) Ceramic Crowns Esthetic Zone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification undertake trial : Nowadays , esthetic become important aspect dentistry due decrease caries prevalence increase patient ' perception teeth appearance . Therefore dentist take consideration esthetic need patient treatment , otherwise patient satisfaction achieve subsequent influence patient self quality life psychological status . As survey concern patient satisfaction regard dental esthetic issue conclude color restoration play primary role patient satisfaction , 89.3 % patient dissatisfied dental appearance restoration ' color . Therefore use ceramic crown increase substantially recent year superior esthetic color render . In addition ability achieve complete patient satisfaction . Rationale : Achieving good esthetic result especially continuous innovation dental ceramic material always easy achieve definitive shade match porcelain restoration natural dentition remain challenge dental practitioner ceramist . Furthermore patient satisfaction final outcome always agreement clinician regard shade matching decision . Therefore study conduct evaluate patient satisfaction shade match Vita suprinity versus e-max ceramic crown esthetic zone . Benefits research patient : Patient receive restoration superior esthetic , shade match quality . It provide patient long-term predictable esthetic restoration As result unnoticed perfect esthetic restoration , patient psychologically improve . Benefits research clinician : Practitioner advantage assess new material use different situation well esthetic outcome . It improve patient confidence dentist . It improve professional skill dentist achieve optimum esthetic result . Explanation choice comparators : The use IPS e.max Press well document literature successful restoration modality . A three-year clinical evaluation two ceramic crown system reveal excellent color match IPS e-max crown ( Alpha 24 crown Bravo 6 crown slight shade mismatch ) . Also patient questionnaire reveal satisfaction appearance comfort restoration . A 2 year prospective clinical observation study report Alpha score ( great 92 % ) indicating appreciable change crown two year study . Also clinical performance lithium disilicate pressable ceramic crown reveal survival rate 97.4 % 5 year 94.8 % 8 year report Gehrt et al. , ( 2013 ) . Another 2 year clinical evaluation lithium disilicate base ceramic crown reveal satisfactory clinical performance , color match Alpha ( 85 % ) baseline , 80 % 1 year recall 60 % 2 year recall . Research hypothesis : There difference clinical performance Vita Suprinity compare Lithium disilicate ceramic crown restoration use esthetic zone . Interventions : VITA SUPRINITY : Vita suprinity product Brochure present new generation glass ceramic material . With aid innovative manufacturing process , glass ceramic enrich approximately 10 % zirconia weight , result world 's first zirconia reinforce lithium silicate ceramic ( ZLS ) . The material feature special fine-grained , homogeneous structure provide excellent material quality consistency , high load capacity long term reliability . Moreover , material offer natural esthetic successful outcome . Also offer outstanding processing characteristic , include easy milling polishing .</detailed_description>
