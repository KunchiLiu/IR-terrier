The investigator recently identify unconscious , self-protective 'hidden motif ' contribute nonadherence chronic disease medication . There critical need expand insight test potential target individual ' 'hidden motif ' low adherence use innovative learning process call Immunity-to-Change . As critical step test intervention target 'hidden motif ' , investigator undertake pilot study assess feasibility acceptability Overcoming Immunity-to-Change intervention determine effect size intervention adherence , blood pressure ( BP ) control , quality life ( QOL ) . The investigator test Immunity-to-Change intervention sample nonadherent old adult hypertension ( n=18 ) . Another sample nonadherent old adult hypertension monitor comparison ( n=18 ) .</brief_summary>
