	<brief_summary>Increasing evidence suggest immune response might determine factor lung cancer tumor progression . The impressive clinical response obtain immune checkpoint inhibitor ( anti-PD-1/PDL-1 , anti-CTLA-4 ) indicate presence preexist antitumor immune response require efficacy highlight critical role antitumor T cell immunity . Recent progress field tumor immunology underline critical role CD4 helper 1 T lymphocyte ( TH1 ) control innate adaptive anticancer immunity . Therefore , monitor tumor specific TH1 response could relevant cancer patient . In order monitor tumor-specific CD4 Th1 responses cancer patient , investigator group previously describe novel promiscuous peptide ( refer UCP : Universal Cancer Peptides ) derive human telomerase ( TERT ) , prototype share tumor antigen . By use UCP-based immuno-assay , pre-existing UCP-specific Th1 response detect blood lung cancer patient ( Telocap01 ) . The frequency magnitude response inversely correlate disease stage . Furthermore , UCP-specific response significantly find patient low PD1+ TIM3+ T cell . Then TeloCap02 study , UCP specific Th1 immune response evaluate lung cancer treatment ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy ) .</brief_summary>
