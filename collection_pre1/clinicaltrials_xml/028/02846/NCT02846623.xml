	<brief_title>Atezolizumab ( PD-L1 mAb ) Combination With Obinutuzumab Ibrutinib Patients With Relapsed Refractory High-risk Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive obinutuzumab vein 4-6 hour Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2-9 . Participant also receive atezolizumab vein Days 1 15 Cycles 2-9 . The first time participant receive atezolizumab take 1 hour . After , participant tolerates drug well , may take 30 minute receive . Participant receive atezolizumab Cycle 1 . All participant receive dose obinutuzumab atezolizumab . If participant already take ibrutinib part participant 's standard care , participant continue take current dose schedule participant assign participant 's regular doctor . Study Visits : On Days 1 15 Cycles 1-9 Days 8 22 Cycle 2 : - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Part routine blood draw may also use test relate immune system . - Participant may physical exam . On Days 2 8 Cycle 1 Days 8 22 Cycles 3-6 , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , participant may tests/procedures perform participant 's local doctor , closer participant 's home . During Cycle 2 , blood draw physical exam must do MD Anderson . After Cycle 2 , participant must physical exam blood draw perform MD Anderson least 1 time month ; exam draw do local clinic doctor 's office . If blood draw physical exam do outside MD Anderson , result send study doctor review.The option blood draw physical exam participant 's local doctor 's office discuss participant study doctor . On Day 28 Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . These routine test include pregnancy test participant become pregnant . - Participant bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - Participant CT PET scan check status disease . If doctor think acceptable , participant may skip End Cycle 3 visit Day 1 Cycle 4 visit instead . This discussed participant . Length Study : Participant may continue receive obinutuzumab atezolizumab 9 cycle . If participant receiving , participant may continue receive ibrutinib part participant 's standard care long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study 1 year follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , participant bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - If doctor think need , participant CT PET scan . Long-Term Follow-Up : After participant 's end-of-study visit , participant continue follow-up visit 1 year time point . One ( 1 ) time month : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test Every 3-6 month : - Participant bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - Participant CT PET scan . If participant start new type anti-CLL treatment 1 year follow-up period , participant stop study visit . This investigational study . Atezolizumab FDA approve commercially available . Its use study investigational . Obinutuzumab ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available use treatment CLL . It consider investigational use drug combination treat CLL . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 72 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
