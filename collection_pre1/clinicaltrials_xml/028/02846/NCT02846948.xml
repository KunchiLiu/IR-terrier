	<brief_summary>The aim study identify diagnostic value focus assessed echocardiography protocol ( FATE - Holm et al 2012 ) patient undergo urgent abdominal surgery sign sepsis . The extended cardiac monitoring may affect patient 's management perioperative period . The investigator expect incidence hemodynamic instability reduce outcome patient improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Focused Transthoracic Echocardiography Urgent Abdominal Surgery Septic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Often sepsis remain undiagnosed begin concentration surgical pathology perioperative period . This result unacceptably high mortality . The investigator hypothesize extended hemodynamic monitoring focus echocardiography allow early detection hemodynamic instability , clinically diagnose yet . The goal investigator study : - To conduct two-group randomize controlled clinical trial compare patient management base standard monitoring extend hemodynamic monitoring focus echocardiography patient undergoing urgent abdominal surgery . - To demonstrate patient management base extended hemodynamic monitoring focus echocardiography result reduce incidence hemodynamic instability perioperative period . - To compare amount administrate intravenous fluid group . The investigator hypothesize focused echocardiography monitor result administrate intravenous fluid perioperative period .</detailed_description>
