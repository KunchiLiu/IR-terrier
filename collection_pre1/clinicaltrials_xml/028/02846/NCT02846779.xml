	<detailed_description>In era rapidly grow healthcare cost , due large part increase burden complexity chronic disease management , target outreach patient likely benefit tailor intervention individual patient need , represent important opportunity maximize healthcare value . The Targeted Adherence intervention Reach Glycemic control Insulin Therapy patient Diabetes ( TARGIT-DM ) trial pragmatic , intention-to-treat , randomized-controlled study evaluate impact three equivalently-priced strategy improve insulin persistence glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] control among patient diabetes insulin . The intervention three study arm consist educational mailing telephonic pharmacist outreach . The pharmacist assess address potential barrier insulin adherence optimal glycemic control . The three study arm employ differ regard patient targeted intensity engagement strategy use . The low intensity intervention arm 1 deployed subject randomize arm . The moderate high intensity intervention deliver focused population within arm 2 3 , respectively , define poor disease control and/or predict risk non-adherence . The intervention provide moderate high intensity arm also include feedback patient 's provider , need , potential enrollment text message program . Patients two arm target receive usual care . The study population trial consist member enrol commercial insurance provide Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey . Insurance claim data use apply inclusion exclusion criterion .
