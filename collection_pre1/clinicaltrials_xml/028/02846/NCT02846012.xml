	<detailed_description>A multi-center ( 3 site 2 investigator ) , prospective trial 300 patient . Patients enrol participate site United States . Study sit conduct study oversight Sterling IRB . Each study site enroll enough patient achieve least 50 evaluable patient undergone treatment cycle use split case sibling embryos half embryo culture CSCM2 half current CSCM ( control ) . The method consist standard ovarian stimulation protocol facility obtain sufficient number mature ( MII ) oocytes fertilization ICSI . Following fertilization , identify diploid ( 2PN ) zygotes evenly divide randomly allocate embryo culture treatment condition CSCM2 CSCM culture accord standard laboratory procedure ( incubated 5-6 % CO2 air low O2 concentration 5-6 % ) blastocyst stage ( Day 5/6 7 ) . Top quality blastocyst ( ) transfer monitored implantation , pregnancy ongoing birth . Embryo transfer either occur fresh frozen cycle . The procedure study design follow standard medical care study site woman IVF treatment ( participant sign separate consent clinic IVF procedure ) . The participant study doctor explain detail procedure participant undergo clinic ; form mean explain detail research study . This study involve randomization patient participation sham procedure .</detailed_description>
