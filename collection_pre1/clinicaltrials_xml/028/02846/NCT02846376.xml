	<brief_title>Single Agent Combined Inhibition After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : - To assess safety single-agent combine checkpoint inhibition nivolumab ipilimumab patient acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation high risk post-transplant recurrence . - Safety endpoint : The composite endpoint consist occurrence least one treatment-related limit toxicity ( checkpoint inhibitor treatment initiate ) define â‰¥ grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity specify CTCAE . Exceptions list section 5.9 apply endpoint well . If 3 7 patient single cohort experience treatment-related limiting toxicity , single cohort terminate . - Efficacy endpoint : To assess progression free survival 12 18 month initiation checkpoint inhibitor therapy patient acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation high risk post-transplant recurrence . The secondary objective study : - Determine toxicity result administration treatment - To assess blood immune reconstitution , phenotype T-cell receptor ( TCR ) repertoire sequence determine diversity high frequency clonal specificity : screening patient ( time inform consent ) within 30 day allogenic transplant conditioning ; donor , apheresis ( stem cell collection ) , serially patient day 1 week 1 checkpoint inhibitor week 4 , 7 , 12 , 18 26 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 month post-transplant time relapse occur within 18 month check point inhibitor initiation . - To assess tumor site immune phenotype , TCR repertoire Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1/2 ) expression bone marrow biopsy available prior allogeneic transplantation conditioning time relapse within 18 month follow initiation check point inhibitor therapy . - To assess complete response rate 3 , 6 12 month autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . - To identify specific intestinal microbial strain associate improved outcome allogeneic stem cell transplantation patient treat checkpoint inhibitor . The overall microbial composition stool sample patient analyze screen ( 7 day post-consent ) , precondition ( collect within 48 hour prior transplant admission ) , engraftment ( within 48 hour absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 500 two sequential day ) , serially , day 1 week 1 ( collect within 48 hour prior clinic visit ) week 4 , 7 , 12 , 18 , 26 9 , 12 , 15 18 month post-transplant , time relapse , occur .</detailed_description>
