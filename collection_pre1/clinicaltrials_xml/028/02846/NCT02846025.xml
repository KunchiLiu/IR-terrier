	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT Epigenetic mechanism may involve regulation lipid metabolism inflammatory marker may therefore contribute cardiovascular risk profile , well environmental factor significant impact epigenetic program gene expression . Methyl group usually add remove need influenced diet soon , dietary factor link change DNA methylation , result change gene expression . Research prevalence gene methylation level impact nutrient intake , well inflammatory condition result dietary intervention gene , sparse area study , therefore , expand knowledge . Thus , understand effect diet rich antioxidant hazelnut oil , inflammation DNA methylation profile important chronic disease cardiovascular disease begin consumption modify lipid research stage provide important dietary allowance development disease prevention strategy even adulthood . This PhD project link large project entitle `` II Diagnosis Cycle Intervention Food Situation , Nutrition Noncommunicable Diseases Prevalent City Population Jo達o Pessoa / PB '' ( II DISANDNT / PB ) two methodological design : first one composition representative sample adult city Jo達o Pessoa , II DISANDNT / JP , population-based study cross-sectional . The second methodological design develop subsample population , select criterion type interventional clinical trial . This model evaluate effect diet rich antioxidant hazelnut oil , inflammation gene expression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This thesis link population-based survey entitle `` Diagnosis II Cycle Intervention Food Situation , Nutrition Noncommunicable Diseases Prevalent city Jo達o Pessoa Population / PB '' ( II DISANDNT / PB ) . For realization thesis , first population-based study , representative adult east area west city Jo達o Pessoa , calculation representative sample age group adult , use information provide city , map municipality , number block per district Brazilian Institute Geography Statistics . Home visit implementation survey questionnaires carried team undergraduate researcher Nutrition course , master doctoral student Post Graduate Program Nutrition Sciences ( PPGCN ) UFPB duly previously train begin data collection pilot study follow . The trained team , recognize draw court , instruct select household court . The block home , home responsible accepted participate amount individual refuse participate randomly select household compute resorteadas randomly thereafter minimize loss . In residence drawn individual , adult age 20-59 year invited participate research application socioeconomic demographic characteristic questionnaire , epidemiological characterization , nutritional assessment food intake , biochemical evaluation brand epigenetic .</detailed_description>
