	<brief_title>Plasma GLP1 Acute Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) associate high mortality prognosis differ among patient . Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) effective method treat AMI . To accurately predict adverse outcome follow pPCI patient AMI help doctor develop precise therapeutic strategy advance . At present predict adverse event pPCI still controversial . In previous study , investigator find glucagon like peptide -1 ( GLP-1 ) improve cardiac function patient AMI PCI , study report plasma GLP-1 level negatively correlate CK-MB patient AMI , relationship plasma GLP1 prognosis AMI patient PCI report , investigator hypothesize plasma level GLP1 associate major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) pPCI . The investigator plan evaluate predicting role plasma GLP1 level major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) patient acute myocardial infarction undergo percutaneous coronary intervention .</detailed_description>
