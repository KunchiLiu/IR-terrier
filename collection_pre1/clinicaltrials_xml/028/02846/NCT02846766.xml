	<brief_title>Study Lenvatinib Patients With Advanced Cancer Aberrations FGF/FGFR Signaling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory , histology-independent study enroll 39 subject regardless FGF/FGFR aberration cancer type order test hypothesis subject advance cancer harbor change FGF/FGFR-related gene respond multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib high rate unselected cancer patient , regardless tumor histological subtype . Lenvatinib multikinase inhibitor inhibit FGFR1-4 well VEGFR1-3 , RET , KIT PDGFR-beta . It inhibit FGFR1 IC50 46 nmol/L , highly potent clinically relevant concentration . Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) FGF receptor ( FGFR ) pathway aberration common malignancy , make pathway potentially appeal target anti-cancer therapy . Clinical trial data suggest target FGFR indeed effective cancer . However , majority data come trial patient population unselected FGF/FGFR pathway abnormality . The true response rate clinical benefit whose cancer harbor FGF/FGFR abnormality may higher observe unselected patient population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; = 18 year old Pathologically confirm advanced metastatic malignancy characterize one following : Subject intolerant standard therapy . Malignancy refractory standard therapy . Malignancy relapse standard therapy . Malignancy standard therapy improve survival least 3 month . Evaluable tumor ( ) document alteration ( ) FGF/FGFRrelated gene ( ) . The FGF/FGFR aberration ( ) identify point subject 's cancer course . FGF/FGFR test must perform CLIAcertified laboratory . Amplification ( ) and/or mutation frequenc ( y ) define accord standard test use . One example , Foundation OneTM , define amplification ≥ 6 copy base substitution mutation present ≥ 5 % mutant allele frequency . Subjects must meet follow laboratory requirement screen ( may repeat ) : Adequate bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mL ; hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL , platelet ≥ 75,000/mL . Adequate liver function : transaminase ( AST/ALT ) alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 ( ≤ 5 X Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) set liver metastasis ) x ULN ; bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Adequate renal function : creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min ( Cockcroft Gault ) . Adequate blood coagulation : international normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 2.3 . Serum amylase lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Adequately control blood pressure ( BP ) : BP ≤ 150/90 mm Hg screening ( may repeat may control antihypertensive medication ) . Adequate performance status ( PS ) : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) PS 02 Women childbearing potential must negative baseline blood pregnancy test . Women men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study least 30 day discontinuation study drug ( half life lenvatinib 28 hour patient cancer ) . Subjects must antitumor agent least 5 half life agent 4 week last day treatment , whichever short . Endocrine therapy ( example breast prostate cancer ) antiHer2 therapy ( example , trastuzumab lapatinib ) allow continue study . Subjects may receive experimental agent agent FDA approve . Ability understand willingness sign write consent document . Pregnant lactating woman . Subjects know hypersensitivity component metabolites drug product . Subjects FGFR mutation know inactivate . Mutations unknown significance ( base currently available information ) allow . Subjects recover toxicity result prior anticancer therapy , except alopecia infertility . Recovery define &lt; Grade 2 severity per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) . Significant cardiovascular impairment : history congestive heart failure great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II , unstable angina , myocardial infarction stroke within 6 month first dose study drug , cardiac arrhythmia require medical treatment Screening . Inability swallow pill determination investigator absorption oral medication would impair . Major surgery ( include placement central line ) within 3 week prior randomization plan surgery course study . Any medical condition , opinion investigator , would preclude study participation . Subjects consider member vulnerable population ( example , prisoner ) .</criteria>
