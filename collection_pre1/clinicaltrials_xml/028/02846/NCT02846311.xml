	<brief_summary>The rapid accurate detection influenza virus respiratory specimen require optimal management patient acute respiratory infection . Because variability symptom numerous cause influenza-like illness , diagnosis influenza make basis clinical criterion alone . Thus , rapid influenza diagnostic test develop Alere Influenza A &amp; B isothermal nucleic acid assay . Investigators prospectively evaluate performance Alere Influenza A &amp; B assay comparison routine Xpert Flu/RSV assay .</brief_summary>
