	<detailed_description>Methodology To investigate feasibility use Play Intervention Dementia enhance cognitive function people dementia . Research objectives 1 . To examine feasibility use Play Intervention Dementia enhance cognitive function . 2 . To explore effect Play Intervention Dementia cognitive function . 3 . To examine experience participate play intervention people dementia . Research design This study feasibility study , design cluster randomize control trial . Two study site ( day care centre ) agree join project randomly allocate either PID group , wait-list control group . A mixed method design employ address three research objective . To evaluate feasibility Play Intervention , information ease recruitment , attendance , occurrence adverse event play intervention collect . Staff perception upon play intervention explore semi-structured interview . To explore preliminary effect Play Intervention , participant ' cognitive function measure baseline ( T0 ) , 2 month ( T1 ) , post intervention ( T2 ) . To examine experience Play Intervention people dementia , every alternate session videotape analysis . Participants Participating centre recruit screen eligibility participant . After obtain initial consent potential participant next kin , his/her eligibility verify research assistant . Participants community dwelling , age 65 medical confirm diagnosis type dementia ( Alzheimer 's disease , vascular dementia , etc. ) . He/she stage early moderate dementia , stage 4-6 screen Global Deterioration Scale , able sit independently participate table activity ; physically stable . There empirical research conduct play intervention dementia . As play intervention regard general cognitive stimulation activity study , sample size estimate reference related literature . Based systematic review cognitive stimulation cognitive function , moderate effect size find ( SMD = 0.41 , 95 % CI = 0.25 , 0.57 ) , significance level 0.05 , power 0.8 . Assuming 20 % attrition rate , 188 participant / group need . This study feasibility study , therefore 10 % main study recruit , i.e . 19 participants/group , 38 participant total . Intervention The Play Intervention Dementia develop Prof A. Ka Tat Tsang University Toronto research team 2013 . It base Strategies Skills Learning Development ( SSLD ) model , promote quality life individual dementia . According SSLD model , human action drive unmet need . Maslow ( 1943 ) state people motivate achieve need , include physiological need , safety need , belong need , esteem need , self-actualization need . People dementia also need , difficulty satisfy need diminish cognitive ability . Despite neuropathological change cause dementia , play intervention , need belong satisfy social interaction group activity ; need esteem content playing toy independently way respect throughout process ; need self-actualization fulfil realize one 's ability creativity . The PID programme pilot Yee Hong Geriatric Centre , Toronto , Canada Yan Oi Tong Day Care Centre Hong Kong . Other intend outcome ( i.e . mood quality life ) , general improvement cognitive function ( include attention , memory , quantitative ability , responsiveness , verbal expression ) note family relatives researcher . This study replicate intervention conduct previous trial . Each group consist 12 - 20 elderly , divide three four subgroup . They participate 12 weekly session 45 - 75 minute . In session , participant warm activity play toy member subgroup . The toys different characteristic would stimulate gross/fine motor skill , proprioception , neuro-corporeal integration , sensory-motor coordination , cognitive capacity , emotional expression . Examples toy Jenga , Domino , Board Games , beach ball plush toy . The session conclude play percussive music instrument . Play assistant ( trained elderly volunteer ) facilitate play intervention set play area , encourage participation , offer assistance minimal instruction , provide attention , ensure safety . They transfer toys subgroup every 8 - 10 minute . It Mayer Griffin ( 1990 ) find people dementia would show considerable interest toy engage stimulus-seeking explore behavior within 10 minute unstructured active play . Play assistant train Play Specialist . Participants remain seated table . The intervention fidelity monitor programme Play Specialist . The Play Specialist possess professional qualification one human service profession license regulatory authority ( e.g . registered nurse , register social worker ) , successfully complete least 30 hour SSLD Play Intervention train recognize accredited programme . Wait-list control condition The control group receive standard care last data collection conduct experimental group . Standard care consist medical personal care , provision basic need , activity carry usual . Measurements Demographic data include age gender , socioeconomic educational background , medical history , live arrangement marital status collect . The global cognitive function participant assess Hong Kong version Montreal Cognitive Assessment excellent inter-rater reliability good discriminatory ability . It consist 11 question take around 15 minute complete . Fuld Object Memory Evaluation ( FOME ) use evaluate memory function encode , storage , recall across five recall trial delay recall trial . This instrument validate Hong Kong Chinese population good test-retest reliability , convergent validity , discriminative power , independent educational background . Verbal fluency assess Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency ( MVFT ) . This instrument modify original Fuld Verbal Fluency Test cultural adaptation , part FOME . The FOME MVFT take 15 minute complete . Semi-structured interview At post-intervention , semi-structured interview staff conduct explore perception play intervention effect participant intervention group . Responsible programme worker social worker two study site invite . The question limit : 1 . Do think play intervention positive negative effect participant ? 2 . Have see change participant ' symptom well-being since start receive play intervention ? Video-taped The engagement participant play intervention analyze watch videotape fill log-sheet play assistant . In log sheet , ( ) total time spend , ( b ) name activity participant engage time spend toy , ( c ) level engagement , ( ) assistance participant need , ( e ) participant ' verbal nonverbal reaction , ( f ) barrier engagement activity record . Data collection procedure A train research assistant responsible data collection semi-structured interview . He/she blind group allocation . Ethical consideration Ethical approval seek University participate organization . The participation entirely voluntary . Verbal explanation information sheet give participant next kin . Written consent seek next kin . Staff interview also explain study , inform consent seek . Participants next-of-kin , staff free withdraw anytime study without penalty . Before session , participates invite join play intervention . If he/she decline twice , his/her decision respect , play assistant centre staff invite late session . The play intervention regard safe side effect report . However , emotional upset adverse reaction , participant bring away venue refer centre social worker follow-up . The participant may choose continue withdraw next intervention session . The question ask research assistant data collection neutral arouse negative feeling . However , emotional upset observe , research assistant try comfort participant refer social worker immediately . All data collect kept confidential , research team retrieve . Individual identity would reveal publish material . Data analysis strategies The statistical software SPSS 23.0 use data entry analysis . As study adopt cluster randomization , characteristic participant centre may correlate . The Generalized Estimating Equation ( GEE ) model use conduct repeat measurement analysis correct within cluster correlation . In analysis , 5 % significance level use . 95 % Confident interval calculate . The interview audio-taped , transcribed subject thematic analysis two researcher elicit concisely describe pattern theme .</detailed_description>
