	<detailed_description>Nowadays , number case increase intraocular pressure glaucoma show huge increase . This increase geriatric population community advance medical care . Surgical correction , treatment , solve problem greatly especially modern surgical technique . Peribulbar block reduce admission discharge time reduce burden patient medical team . On hand , carry risk increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Which , subsequently , limit usage glaucoma surgery . Dexmedetomidine , alpha 2 agonist , well establish role decrease intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . This effect show histological level clinical level . It test many study additive local anaesthetic augment effect block achieve accept level patient sedation ( ** ) . Many route test intravenous infusion , intramuscular injection topically local anaesthesia . There debate best route optimum dose achieve desire clinical effect least side effect . There study , till , examine effect Dexmedetomidine diseased eye pathology lead increase IOP . This study state hypothesis Dexmedetomidine locally additive local anaesthesia different dos , increase duration block achieve level sedation , also reduce IOP diseased eye level help surgical condition improve surgical outcome .</detailed_description>
