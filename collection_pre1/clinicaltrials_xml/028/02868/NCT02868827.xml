	<detailed_description>DETAILED DESCRIPTION Introduction : Vitamin D fat soluble vitamin affect multiple system body . It play key role musculoskeletal system also work immune cardiovascular system . Because wide range anti-inflammatory metabolic property , vitamin D , recently , gain immense importance among intensivists . Most critically ill patient vitamin D deficiency high risk complication range systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , sepsis , septic shock , multi-organ dysfunction , multi-organ failure finally death . Immune system dysregulation think play pivotal role development sepsis . Onset progression sepsis dependent upon fine balance pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory mediator immune system . Massive uncontrolled release pro-inflammatory cytokine lead wide spread tissue damage multi-organ failure . It find cell immune system ( innate acquire ) express receptor vitamin D. Low level render immune system regulatory cell dysfunctional turn increase risk infection adverse outcomes . It estimate even optimal treatment anywhere 16 % 80 % patient sepsis n't survive . To improve survival critically ill patient , several research study focus identification various biomarkers correlation disease severity . Timely supplementation cholecalciferol demonstrate one mortality reduction intervention . In recent study , vitamin D identify important regulator immune system deficiency quite common ICU patient range 81.5 % 99 % . A number scientific study document strong correlation low level vit.D increase rate adverse outcome include infection multi drug resistant organism , acute kidney injury , decrease leave ventricular ejection fraction mortality ICU patient . It find emergence acinetobacter baumannii infection significantly common vit D deficient critically ill patient vit D deficiency independent risk factor development Acinetobacter baumannii infection intensive care unit . A recent RCT demonstrate 50 % reduction hospital mortality patient severe vit.D deficiency follow single high dose cholecalciferol ( Vitamin D3 ) . However , role Vit.D supplementation boost host immune system eventually reduction mortality yet determine large randomize control trail . In patient severe vitamin D deficiency , gastrointestinal absorption vit.D , enteral supplementation could variable depend upon patient 's gastrointestinal function , critical illness activity hepatic cytochrome P 450 system . In order restore optimal vit.D level critically ill patient ( possibly within first 48 hour ) , single high dose suggest admission ICU . As critically ill patient , highly unlikely restore Vitamin D within reasonable period time supplement 400-4000 international units/day ( recommended daily allowance ) . Moreover , single large dose vit.D enteral route highly unlikely cause vit.D toxicity . The acutely toxic level vit.D consider 150 ng/ml . Furthermore , high load dose cholecalciferol justify base safety finding previous study . In addition , pilot study follow large randomize controlled trial conduct Karen A et al , serious adverse event note single high dose ( 540,000 I.U ) cholecalciferol . The high 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measure 107 ng/ml far currently suggest toxic level vit.D ( 150 ng/ml ) . Moreover , one patient vitamin D3 group find total serum calcium level 12 mg/dl ionize serum calcium level 6 mg/dl patient primary hyperparathyroidism ( although normocalcemic study inclusion ) . However , incidence fall fracture similar vitamin D3 placebo group follow period six month . So single high dose cholecalciferol less likely increase incidence hypocalcaemia , hypercalciuria , fall fracture find increase annual high dos vitamin D3 . Hence intend use single high dose cholecalciferol order restore deficiency quickly , hopefully within 1 2 day order give maximum benefit critical ill patient right start illness . The aim RCT study role Vit.D supplementation critically ill patient . By boost already struggle immune system critically ill patient , assume significant reduction mortality adverse outcome . Hypothesis : A single high dose cholecalciferol supplementation improve survival critically ill patient severe vitamin D deficiency . Null Hypothesis : A single high dose Cholecalciferol supplementation critically ill patient reduce mortality adverse outcome . Recruitment randomization : Patients surrogate contact admission ICU study information provide research staff member . The consented patient randomize . Randomization list prepare King Abdullah Medical City ( KAMC ) research centre . The list use prepare seal envelope contain assigned treatment . These envelope store pharmacy open research pharmacist prepare medication/placebo randomized patient . Blinding : Blinding do research pharmacist KAMC pharmacy . Fresh milk use placebo . The study medication ( white color , powdered form cellulose base vit.D ) dissolve fresh milk interventional drug placebo color , odour , consistency , taste , amount interventional medication . For vit . D deficient patient , supplement 50,000 IU cholecalciferol per week enteral route part routine ICU treatment plan . As recruited patient severe vitamin D deficiency ( Vit . D level 12ng/ml ) interventional placebo group patient receive routine treatment vit.D deficiency 50,000 IU cholecalciferol enteral route per week . Intervention : Patients randomize vitamin D group receive 400,000 IU cholecalciferol dissolve 45 ml fresh milk orogastric tube/nasogastric tube/Oral 1st 24 hour ICU admission . This high dose addition routine treatment vitamin D deficiency . Post-recruitment retention strategy : We follow patient 30 day long stay ICU supplementation single high dose vitamin D placebo . As work critically ill patient , expect least week hospital stay . However , patient early quick recovery discharge home follow one assign research team member contact phone inquire complication relate research study . Method : We complete randomize controlled trial supplement cholecalciferol 400,000 IU versus placebo within 24 hour ICU admission would additional routine treatment vit.D deficiency . Safety high dose vit D validate previous studies.This trial employ block randomization intention treat protocol . This single centre study would complete period 2 complete year KAMC Intensive care Unit . Laboratory Measurements : Blood sample obtain baseline ( day 0 ) day 1 , 3 , 7 , 28 ass serum parathyroid hormone , total bioavailable 25-hydroxyvitamin D level , phosphate , procalcitonin , leukocytic count , hemoglobin , creatinine , bilirubin , beta natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , blood glucose albumin level . In addition also measure urinary calcium urinary creatinine level Data Collection : Patients follow ( 1 month ) closely development study-drug related complication , example , hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , fracture etc . Data element collect include , limited : 1 . - Date time admission hospital 2 . - Mode admission ( Emergency Room in-patients ) 3 . - Date time ICU admission 4 . - 25 - hydroxyl vitamin D level admission ICU . 5 . - Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score 6 . - Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Index ( APACHI ) Score 7-Patient 's co-morbidities ( Diabetes , Hypertension , Chronic kidney disease , Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , Ischemic Heart Disease , Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting , Cerebrovascular accident , Arrhythmias , Anemias , smoking , obesity , cancer ) 8 - Mode Oxygen delivery patient 9 - Previous positive culture antibiotic therapy within last 3 month 10 - Empirical antibiotic therapy admission hospital ICU 11 - Baseline clinically relevant investigation example , Echo , Electro cardio graphy , Ultrasound Doppler Deep venus thrombosis , CT brain/chest/abdomen , 12 - Endo/bronchoscopic finding 13 - Vasopressors ionotropic support duration 14 - Central venus catheter , arterial line , pigtail , chest tube ( site , date time insertion ) 15 - Evidence acute acute chronic kidney injury admission ICU . 16 - Surgeries - previous recent surgery post op complication 17 - Previous immunosuppressive therapy example chemo/radio/glucocorticoid therapy . Sample size calculation : A recent RCT demonstrate almost 50 % reduction hospital mortality ( 46.1 % placebo versus 28.6 % Vit D group ) supplement 540,000 IU Vit D3 critically ill patient severe vitamin D deficiency ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D level â‰¤ 12 ng/ml ) . With alpha = 5 % ( two tail test ) , power = 95 % , baseline mortality control group 30 % test group mortality 15 % , sample size require would 195 patient per group . To account loss follow around 10 % , aim recruit 215 patient group . So total number patient require group would 430 2 full year . Statistical Analysis : We use intention treat approach avoid effect crossover dropout . Standard statistical analysis include normally near normally distribute variable report mean non-normally distribute variable median . Means compare use student 's test median use Mann-Whitney U test . Differences proportion among categorical data assess use Fisher 's exact test . A p-value le 0.05 consider represent statistical significance comparison .</detailed_description>
