	<brief_summary>Goal study : A- To find best protocol catheter lock solution decrease prevalence catheter thrombosis 1 . - The time first episode catheter thrombosis lead catheter change . 2 . - Number acute episode thrombosis interrupt dialysis 3 . - Median Survival life catheter group adjust outcome . B- Specific Objective : To evaluate cost effectiveness measure 1 . Amount r-TPA use group treatment acute catheter thrombosis 2 . Number catheter exchange group 3 . Hospitalization day relate catheter malfunction CRI group 4 . Type day antibiotics 5 . Cost treatment group c- Secondary Objective : To correlate result two catheter lock solution protocol publish data use r-TPA instead heparin week compare heparin 3 time per week lock solution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Tunneled Catheter Thrombosis Hemodialysis Patients : Prospective Study From Qatar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective single blind randomize control study . All patient undergo tunneled catheter regular hemodialysis three hemodialysis unit meet inclusion criterion include study . Signed informed consent take patient first authorized relative . All patient randomize 1:1 basis use computer-generated program.Patients randomly assign lock catheter post HD either 1.35 % taurolidine citrate ( 2H-1,2,4-thiadiazine-4,4 ` -methylenebis [ tetrahydro-1,1,1 ` ,1 ` -tetraoxide ] , 4 % citrate 500 IU/ml heparin ( TauroLock Hep500 ) ( TauroPharmGmbH , www.tauropharm.de ) end Hemodialysis session interdialytic period first two session per week first two interdialytic period taurolidine citrate , 4 % citrate /25000 IU unit urokinase ( TauroLock U25000 ) end third session week end , ( week end ) . The assigned nurse flush catheter session 20 mL saline instill TauroLock accord filling volume catheter . Before start next dialysis lock solution aspirate discard . Acute catheter thrombosis interrupt dialysis treat r-TPA accord unit protocol , happen three consecutive HD consider malfunction refer catheter exchange . Any catheter refer vascular surgeon exchange ; continue calculate day might gap referral 's time catheter exchange due admission problem . If catheter replace , patient continue arm study . Control Group : We lock dialysis catheter post HD TauroLock Hep500 end Hemodialysis session interdialytic period . Intervention Group : We lock dialysis catheter post HD TauroLock Hep500 end first two session per week first two interdialytic period TauroLock U 25000at end third session week end , ( week end ) . For episode acute catheter malfunctioning : - The study coordinator know name patient receive interdialytic r-TPA medication room collect data patient 's file . The study coordinator follow vascular census daily base know patient catheter problem follow status dialysis inpatient file . For catheter relate infection : - If episode CRI , document infectious control file study coordinator collect data in-patient file , dialysis file medicom . plan enrollment : 300 subject</detailed_description>
