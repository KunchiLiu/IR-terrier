	<brief_summary>Purpose : The objective study investigate effect accelerate Invisalign vibration therapy rate orthodontic tooth movement , activation inflammation biomarkers well pain level experience orthodontic patient initial 12 week alignment . Participants : Up 30 orthodontic patient University North Carolina Orthodontic Residency Program recruit study . Patients older 18 year old otherwise healthy subject previously diagnose malocclusion . Procedures ( method ) : Each patient randomly allocate either control group one two intervention group . Patients within control group receive standard Invisalign therapy without vibration . Patients within intervention group receive accelerate Invisalign therapy without vibration . Patients receive vibration therapy utilize AcceleDent Aura device provide light vibration .25 Newtons ( N ) 30 Hertz ( Hz ) frequency twenty minute daily . Three dimensional image subject 's dentition record five time 0 day , 4 day , 2 week , 6 week , 12 week progress visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Align Technology© , Inc. develop Invisalign® 1997 meet esthetic demand orthodontic patient provider . Invisalign patient receive series computer-assisted design stereolithic clear retainer incrementally resolve malocclusion . Invisalign® advance orthodontic technology clear aligners , ceramic bracket lingual brace offer option address esthetic demand orthodontic patient duration treatment continue one challenging aspects practice . In 2008 , OrthoAccel Technologies© , Inc. develop AcceleDent device accelerate tooth movement reduce orthodontic treatment time . Patients receive vibration therapy instruct bite AcceleDent mouthpiece , vibrate .25 N ( 25 gram ) force level 30 Hz frequency 20 minute per day . The theory underlie AcceleDent use vibration expedite orthodontic tooth movement start 1892 study Julius Wollf , discover bone adapts pressure load . In 2001 , Astronauts space attempt use principles Wolff 's Law maintain normal bone quality work perform daily task stand vibrate plate aid elastic strap . In 2004 , effect vibration therapy bone density support increase bone density strength note post-menopausal woman receive whole body vibration therapy . OrthoAccel claim vibration therapy use AcceleDent device reduce treatment time 50 percent accelerate process bone remodeling require orthodontic tooth movement . In 2013 , despite relatively little scientific evidence , US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve AcceleDent class II medical device orthodontic accessory facilitate accelerate tooth movement . Invisalign therapy conjunction AcceleDent aggressively market towards esthetically sensitive patient , coincidentally , concerned duration treatment . Some orthodontic provider use vibration therapy deviate standard 2-week aligner schedule recommend 4-day aligner schedule . Orthodontic patient receive accelerated Invisalign therapy conjunction AcceleDent claim reduce treatment time much 50 percent . What responsible positive result ? The accelerated tooth movement might simply result accelerated Invisalign therapy , would raise question whether vibration therapy cost associate AcceleDent justify . The purpose primary specific aim study determine cause accelerate tooth movement . Because vibration therapy use conjunction accelerate Invisalign aligner schedule , assumption vibration therapy promote faster tooth movement . However , current literature , clinical trial , support efficacy vibration therapy accelerate tooth movement lacking . Accelerated orthodontic tooth movement may offer many benefit , patient orthodontist . Reduced treatment time reduce burden orthodontic treatment decrease risk undesired treatment sequela ( e.g. , white spot lesion , caries , gingivitis , etc ) potentially reduce discomfort commonly associate orthodontic treatment . Orthodontists benefit accelerate tooth movement multiple reason pertain practice management increase profitability . Orthodontists use accelerated treatment technique report increased profit margin due reduce chair time increase organic growth due differentiation practice . There also potential negative outcome associate accelerated orthodontic tooth movement . For patient , potential increase risk root resorption , increase treatment fee pain associated treatment . At time , publish data regard potential orthodontic relapse follow accelerate orthodontic tooth movement . There several publication support fact relapse know risk conventional orthodontic treatment . The investigator make safe assumption accelerate orthodontic treatment would different conventional orthodontic therapy regard relapse potential . All orthodontic patient must compliant regard orthodontic retention relapse expect . Most orthodontist charge $ 700-800 AcceleDent therapy addition normal orthodontic fee . Finally , publish data regard pain associate accelerated Invisalign treatment . Further , mechanism underlie increase orthodontic tooth movement due vibration remain unclear . Studies cellular level show promising complicate mechanism vibration may enhance activation various cell proliferation differentiation molecule within periodontal ligament ( PDL ) stem cell well increase level gingival inflammation biomarkers . For example , vibration therapy might accelerate breakdown cellular cytoskeleton , increase actinG traffic nucleus , increase Runx2 gene expression , thus facilitate bone formation . Whether mechanotransduction mechanism translate clinical tooth movement unknown clinical evidence remain elucidated . In study , investigator propose randomize prospective clinical design investigate effect AcceleDent vibration therapy efficiency tooth movement , activation gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers patient discomfort conjunction accelerate Invisalign therapy .</detailed_description>
