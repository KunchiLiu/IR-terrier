	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis imperfecta ( brittle bone disease ) rare genetic disease characterize fragile bone low mass ossue , secondary abnormal collagen synthesis . This real congenital osteoporosis . The prevalence disease know precisely , 1 10000 20000 . There many form osteogenesis imperfecta classify patient symptomatology minor patient lethal form neonatal period . The main symptom dominate fracture bone deformity , particularly low limb . Bisphosphonate medication use 10 year reduce number fracture . However long-term effect know date , allow even establish proof benefit risk . Thus unable process patient long time , drug treatment leave much therapeutic solution surgery . The goal surgery treat fracture , treat bone deformity prevent fracture future . In long bone limb , effective technique intramedullary nailing . The majority realize nail nail either slide telescopic enable reinforce bone intramedullary osteosynthesis material entire length period bone growth . It show technique slide nail inexpensive reliable especially age 5 year . After age , telescopic nail nailing . The first telescopic nail describe Bailey-Dubow nail still widely use France . However , number complication relate use important . Thus , 8 % disunity equipment 33 72 % nail migration force change one time growth . A new nail present French orthopedic company 2005 Fassier Duval report much low complication rate rate nail migration 9 % , without open knee joint , possible highlight Bailey-Dubow . It propose conduct prospective series 10 nail low extremity nail Fassier-Duval patient osteogenesis imperfecta compare result series patient already treat Bailey-Dubow nail order highlight advantage disadvantage use nail .</brief_summary>
