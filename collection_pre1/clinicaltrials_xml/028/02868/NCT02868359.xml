	<brief_title>PROs Chronic Cervical Pain Patients With Accompanying Upper Limb Radiating Pain Treated With Pregabalin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational background : Cervical pain upper limb radiate pain ( neuropathic component ) , cervical spondylosis radiculopathy cervical spondylotic myelopathy , one typical common neuropathic pain . However , Japan , large number patient treated NSAIDs without adequately assess cause pain , despite α2δ ligand , SNRI ( Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ) , TCA ( Tricyclic Antidepressants ) recommend clinical guideline neuropathic pain . Therefore , treatment satisfaction patient low . This currently major issue treatment cervical pain neuropathic component Japan . In fact , previous study assess effect pregabalin low back pain patient radiculopathy suggest selection appropriate analgesic accord cause pain improve pain related sleep interference , pain function . However , report regard effect pregabalin cervical pain patient neuropathic component . Therefore , propose conduct observational study order ass effect pregabalin cervical radiculopathy , add routine clinical care . The present study encourage understand necessary assessing cause pain , treat appropriate analgesic . Research objectives : To evaluate effect pregabalin compare conventional analgesic care chronic cervical pain patient accompany upper limb radiate pain ( neuropathic component ) treat primary care setting routine clinical practice . Study design : This 8-week , multicenter prospective non-interventional observational study . Subjects chronic cervical radiate pain patient accompany upper limb radiate pain ( neuropathic component ) meet entry criterion enrol baseline duration study . Study arm pregabalin without usual care vs. usual care ( mono/combo therapy ) . The usual care assume NSAIDs , Antidepressants , weak opioids , acetaminophen etc . The analgesic treatment determine clinical judgment physician charge patient management . This therapeutic choice relate decision take part study . All enrolled subject receive analgesic treatment . The study require 3 visit least , baseline/enrollment visit , Week 4 visit Week 8 visit ( discontinuation ) .</detailed_description>
