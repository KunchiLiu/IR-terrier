	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 ) determine cohort specific technical error use categorization response rate ; 2 ) determine individualize intensity prescription superior standard approach regard VO2max cardiometabolic risk factor responsiveness ; 3 ) Investigate time course change throughout 12 week CRF train individualized standardize exercise prescription ; 4 ) determine non-responders become responder exercise intensity prescription modify . It hypothesize : 1 . The individualized method elicit great responsiveness measurement compare standardized method . 2 . There great amount non-responders standardize group ( base change VO2max ) . 3 . When participant standardize group consider non-responders change exercise prescription individualize group , become responder ( base change VO2max )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individual Variability Aerobic Exercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It generally accept individual variability cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) training . However , underlie cause variability well understood . Traditionally , standardize approach exercise prescription utilize relative percentage maximal heart rate ( HR ) , HR reserve ( HRR ) , maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) , VO2 reserve establish exercise intensity . This 'one size fit ' model fails take consideration individual metabolic response exercise may relate variability training response . An individualized exercise prescription utilize threshold-based training model ( i.e . ventilatory threshold ) would help consider individual metabolic response exercise training . However , minimal research conduct differentiate standardize individualized method . Therefore , randomize control trial within community-based wellness program implement investigate follow research question : individualized exercise prescription decrease incidence non-response CRF cardiometabolic measurement compare standardized approach ? The criterion determine incidence response set base biological variability measurement error determine baseline testing . A secondary outcome study investigate time course change response 12 week individualize standardized exercise prescription . Currently , minimal research exist effect differ exercise prescription time course change report individual data . Many experimental trial conduct control supervised environment may lack real world application . This investigation would occur community-based wellness program encourage 'real-world ' application . Results study would enhance ability exercise physiologist prescribe exercise individual , rather 'one size fit ' model . This would first study investigate individualized versus standardize exercise prescription isocaloric exercise volume . Therefore , sedentary men woman ( n = 40 ) randomize one two experimental group - individualize standardized . There separate control group ( n = 20 ) recruit community inclusion criterion experimental group . Exercise training perform 3 day week weekly energy expenditure progressively increase 5.6 15.4 kcal/kg/week 12 week one two exercise intensity regimens : 1 ) standardize method base percentage HRR , 2 ) threshold base method use first ( VT1 ) second ventilatory threshold ( VT2 ) . Participants undergo test ( anthropometric measure , blood profile , maximal exercise test ) baseline , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week . Following 12 week intervention , participant categorize responder non-responder base overall change VO2max . For responder , do intervention . However , non-responders ask complete second 12 week intervention experimental group ( i.e . non-responder standardized group complete 12 week intervention individualize group . The exercise prescription progression second 12 week .</detailed_description>
