	<brief_title>Repetition Improves Precision Trueness Digital Intraoral Scans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Participants : This study approve institutional review board Ehwa Womans University Medical Center Mokdong Hospital , dental hygienist suitable purpose study select ( ECT14-02A-27 ) . Participants assign one four patient , subsequently scan oral cavity single patient 10 time repeatedly 4 day . Study Design : The participant visit dental clinic perform scan 4 day . In order investigate difference precision trueness two type intraoral scanner , participant scan dental arch single patient 10 time use assigned digital intraoral scanner . On first day , either two type scanner ( iTero Trios ) , patient assign . Then , participant train theory practice assign scanner , subsequently , use , scan dental arch assign patient twice . On second third day , dental arch patient scan 3 time respectively , fourth day , experiment finish scan patient twice . Statistical Analyses : Collected data analyze use SPSS Ver . 20.0 statistical package . For determination difference deviation accord scanner , independent two-sample t-test conduct examine significance precision data . For comparison trueness accord repeat learning , repeat measure ANOVA use test difference scanner , clinical experience participant , scan region within scanner group . The significance time-dependent change , interaction scanner group time variable , examine within-subject test . Differences scanner group examine between-subject test . The significance 10 consecutive scan four visit within scanner group , difference scanner group time point , examine post-hoc test , perform use Bonferroni method multiple comparison ( Î±= 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
