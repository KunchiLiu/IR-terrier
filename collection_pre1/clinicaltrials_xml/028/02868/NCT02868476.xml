	<detailed_description>Clinical subclinical thyroid disease usually use describe patient mild symptom correlate hyperthyroid hypothyroid state . Thyroid ultrasonography could differentiate benign malignant nodular lesion , together fine needle aspiration cytology surgical pathology . Thyrotropin ( TSH , thyroid stimulate hormone ) pivotal investigation laboratory diagnosis define subclinical thyroid disease . An elevated TSH normal free thyroxine triiodothyronine level serum define subclinical hypothyroidism , subnormal TSH normal thyroid hormone concentration subclinical hyperthyroidism . Generally , prevalence subclinical hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism report 4 % -10 % &amp; 1 % -2 % general population , respectively . Although subclinical thyroid disease prevalent , still consensus screen clinical subclinical thyroid disease , include hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism , nodular goiter thyroid cancer . Under consideration age , gender familial history autoimmune thyroid disease . However , screen thyroid dysfunction consider high risk patient , include 1 ) elderly ; 2 ) history atrial fibrillation ; 3 ) previous thyroid disease history ; 4 ) confirm autoimmune disease ; 5 ) neck exposure radiation ( example , nasopharyngeal cancer , post-radiation ) ; 6 ) family history probable autoimmune thyroid disease , 7 ) pregnant state prior thyroid disease history . Therapeutic decision clinical subclinical thyroid dysfunction consider individually . Therapeutic option anti-thyroid medication and/or radioactive iodine , thyroidectomy could consider large goiter hyperthyroidism . For clinical subclinical hypothyroidism , therapeutic consideration aim reduction progression overt hypothyroidism , improve heart function , correction dyslipidemia , relieve senescence depressive mood . Thyroid ultrasonography help u keep long term observation thyroid structural change . But long term outcome treatment functional structural thyroid disease record delicately Taiwan . Further investigation observe future . We hope check relationship various thyroid diseases biochemical survey/ultrasonography . The purpose study aim early prevention detection potential risk factor thyroid disease Taiwan .</detailed_description>
