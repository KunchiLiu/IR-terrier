	<brief_summary>Stress , anger depress humor operate trigger Acute Coronary Syndrome.1 It often find literature patient refer excessive anger , anxiety , sadness , pain acute stress promptly acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) onset , recent meta-analysis report strong association occurrence AMI many acute emotions.2 According Mostofsky , Maclure , Tofler , Muller Mittleman3 risk suffer AMI double anger burst episode compare another experienced situation . Anger common manifestation psychological stress,4 consider hypothesis emotion could trigger atherogenic process several mechanisms.5-9 Evidences even suggest hostile people inhibit anger expression prone develop coronary atherosclerosis.10 Coronary atherosclerosis feature narrow coronary artery account endothelial thickening cause build atheromatous plaques.11 It process characterized inflammatory fiberproliferative response artery wall , cause continuous aggression surface whose thickening , evoke evolution fat streak atherosclerotic lesion , fiber plaque quite slow.12 Vascular alteration present atherosclerosis derive essential process : endothelial dysfunction , early establishment alters vase responsiveness , lead vessel constriction,13 coronary blood flood disorder , 13,14 atherosclerosis thrombosis evolution . Endothelial dysfunction also result loss natural anti-thrombotic property involve endothelium patency.14 According study perform group Hemodynamics Sector Cardiology Institute Rio Grande Sul recently publish International Journal Cardiology , anger management significantly low among patient CAD compare without CAD , occurrence major cardiovascular event ( MACE ) significantly high patient present low anger control . Both association independent traditional risk factor , occurrence previous event another anger aspects.15 Thus , study design order evaluate effect `` cognitive training anger management control '' endothelium-dependent vasodilation arm artery patient acute myocardial infarction ST segment elevation submit primary coronary intervention . Secondary objective comprehend assessment treatment influence incidence recurrent cardiovascular event patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MANAGING ANGER IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ( MAPAMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ANGER EVALUATION : Anger assess Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory ( STAXI ) . This instrument develop evaluate expression anger component role variety medical condition . These statement assess Likert scale 4 point . Individuals ask intensity anger , often experience emotion . The anger trait measure individual difference willingness experience anger . It evaluate 10 question , score 10 40 point . It divide temperament anger reaction . Anger expression provide general index frequency anger experience , express , suppress control evaluate three subscales : anger inside , angry feeling repress store ; anger-out , individual express anger toward person object environment ; anger management ( control ) measure frequency individual try control expression raiva . Each subscales assess eight question , range 32 64 point . The total score expression anger evaluate result : Total + total - control +16 . Randomization All patient evaluate hospitalization AMI , anger control score le 27 point invited participate . A randomization list obtain random.org site generate sequential envelope , seal number opened order day assessment endothelial function . Endothelial function Endothelial dysfunction early dysfunctional vascular response observe tissue prone develop atherosclerosis also associate vessel atherosclerosis later stage . The evaluation endothelial function perform researcher `` blind '' treatment group . The endothelium-dependent vasodilation brachial artery evaluate ultrasound linear transducer 3-12 MHz ( EnVisor CHD , Philips , Bothell , WA , USA ) , hold automated measurement vessel diameter equipment use software . The evaluation conduct morning fast 12 hour control temperature ( 22 Â° C ) . After ten minute image brachial artery rest record linear transducer place antecubital fossa continuously one minute ( basal ) . The sphygmomanometer place arm inflate 50 mmHg limit systolic blood pressure five minute , change diameter brachial artery 60 second cuff deflation compare basal diameter . The image vessel diameter end-diastole ( identified R wave ECG ) digitize record interval 3 second throughout procedure , subsequently analyze off-line use software equipamento41 . ANGER TREATMENT : Patients allocate experimental group receive specific information guidance anger , order develop appropriate management feeling . There two meeting 40 minute monthly frequency . The technique use meeting base `` Cognitive Training Anger Control '' , develop test Lipp Malagris19 several clinical group . They semi-structured interview focus base cognitive behavioral therapy . Session 1 -Delivery handout ( Appendix IV ) participant `` How deal anger . '' Reading Discussion follow concept : What anger ? Questioning usually make feel angry . Identification cognitive , emotional conductuais anger ; Identification `` trigger '' anger ; anger relation identification cardiovascular physiology . According Lipp Malagris19 ( p.115 ) `` anger change way body work , change breathe , pressure increase , etc . Mentioning somatic disease link anger . When person feel anger , physical reaction occur automatic unplanned , difficult control ; example , phrase others use calm anger increase , `` stay calm '' , `` control '' , etc . Session 2 -Perform survey `` elicitors event anger . '' Point cognition , interpret fact lead different emotion . Explanation Cognitive Training control anger . Talk : Thought agent event person 's behavior ; People evaluate differently event give lot anger person judge right ; The person evaluate event different way different time ; As angry behavior directly link interpretation people give event ; When interpret erroneous illogical , rational , often realize think , think urge action compensate ; It important improve way evaluate event world around . Closure : Deep Breathing Exercise Technical Time-out : isolate situation generate anger take control . Reinforce importance return 2 month make final research evaluation . The control group patient receive psychological treatment hospital least . CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS Phone call follow-up do verify occurrence major cardiovascular event : cardiovascular death , new PTCA , stent thrombosis , stroke hospitalization , 30 day one year acute myocardial infarction register database . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The minimum sample size calculate 88 patient detect 1 % difference flow-mediated dilation two study group , average standard deviation 1.67 % , p &lt; 0.05 statistical power 90 % . The data present mean confidence interval ( 95 % CIs ) , unless otherwise specify . All analyzes base principle intention treat , conduct researcher whether cognitive training control anger . Repeated measure analysis variance perform determine difference flow-mediated dilation ( primary endpoint ) secondary outcome two group time , use conservative F test interaction time study group ( SPSS software , version 18 ) . The Geisser correction F test use adjust degree freedom roundness deviation ( one condition repeat measure analysis variance [ ANOVA ] ) . logarithmic transformation data undertaken appropriate . Fisher 's post hoc analysis unpaired pair data perform interpreted use Bonferroni-Holm adjustment multiple comparison . The post correlation hoc analysis ( Spearman rank-correlation method ) perform evaluate relationship change flow-mediated dilation baseline 3 month change anger control score assess STAXI begin 3 month . Differences categorical variable calculate use chi-square test . A value P-tailed &lt; 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance .</detailed_description>
