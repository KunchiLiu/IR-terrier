	<detailed_description>A major disadvantage MSIS criteria-based definition PJI two essential criterion , tissue culture histological analysis , available surgery . In case surgical sample critical diagnosis infection , physician may need adjust treatment post operatively patient base treatment provide . The availability preoperative test correlate well MSIS criterion could improve patient care . Currently , clinician suspicious PJI due pain failure arthroplasty , consider standard-of-care request blood synovial fluid test begin process diagnose infection . A synovial fluid test PJI correlate final MSIS definition could request early preoperative stage diagnostic process . Synovasure® PJI ELISA Test qualitative vitro diagnostic device intend adjunct detection periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) synovial fluid patient evaluate revision surgery . Synovasure® PJI ELISA Test utilizes test measure biomarkers , alpha-defensins 1-3 , synovial fluid joint infect . Synovasure® PJI ELISA Test result intend used conjunction clinical diagnostic finding aid patient 's diagnosis infection . Synovasure® PJI Lateral Flow Test qualitative vitro diagnostic device intend adjunct detection periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) synovial fluid patient evaluate revision surgery . Synovasure® PJI Lateral Flow Test utilizes test measure biomarkers , alpha-defensins 1-3 , synovial fluid joint infect . Synovasure® PJI Lateral Flow Test result intend used conjunction clinical diagnostic finding aid patient 's diagnosis infection .</detailed_description>
