	<brief_summary>Many hospital begin give insulin nearly patient diabetes hospital even patient use insulin home . Controlling blood sugar insulin patient hospitalize believe reduce risk complication death , research demonstrate benefit except patient critically ill . The purpose study , therefore , evaluate whether insulin therapy actually reduce in-hospital complication , death , need intensive care , length stay hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiologic Insulin Therapy Management Hyperglycemia Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim propose study determine physiologic insulin therapy administer general hospital inpatient hyperglycemia favorably affect in-hospital complication mortality , need intensive care , length stay . The secondary aim determine magnitude benefit derive therapy differs ( ) patient know vs. newly diagnose diabetes , ( b ) medical vs. surgical patient . The study analyze data natural experiment occur applicant institution introduce universal physiologic insulin therapy standard care hyperglycemia . A quasi-experimental before-and-after study compare in-hospital complication , mortality , resource use patient comorbid type 2 diabetes vs. implementation standard ( n≈6400 ) . Outcomes measure 7 nearby acute-care teaching hospital two time interval provide parallel control data ( n≈35,000 ) . Data control hospital make possible evaluate whether temporal change patient characteristic variable affect hospital region could explain effect might otherwise erroneously attribute intervention . Given high prevalence comorbid diabetes hospital possibility universal physiologic insulin manage hyperglycemia may deliver intended benefit could even harm good , answer question important goal .</detailed_description>
