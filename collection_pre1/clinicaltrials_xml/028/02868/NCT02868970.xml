Vaccine coverage rate measure use follow : 1. pharmacy database analysis , 2. public health vaccine report physician , 3. number vaccine dos deliver pharmacy four region , 4. public survey within study community determine immunization status . Intervention community include Saint John , New Brunswick New Glasgow/Pictou/Antigonish , Nova Scotia area , include small town Stellarton Westville , Nova Scotia .
