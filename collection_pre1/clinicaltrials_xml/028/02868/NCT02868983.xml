	<detailed_description>The chronic disease drive majority mortality , morbidity cost America around globe largely behavioral origin management . Tobacco , diet , physical inactivity , alcohol , substance abuse , non-adherence treatment , insomnia , anxiety , depression , stress major cause morbidity , mortality expense , especially chronic medical problem heart disease , lung disease , diabetes , kidney disease also present . Behavioral problem often effectively manage improve outcome patient , family health care system , current health care system often unable provide care . Behavioral Health include mental health care , substance abuse care , health behavior change , attention family psychosocial factor . Many people behavioral health need present primary care may refer mental health substance abuse specialist , method often unacceptable patient . Two new model propose help patient . In co-location , behavioral health provider locate near primary practice increase likelihood successful referral treatment initiation . An alternative Integrated Behavioral Health ( IBH ) Behavioral Health Clinician specially train work closely medical provider full member primary treatment team . Although clear status quo under-diagnosis inadequate referral treatment acceptable , know alternative model best . The research question : Does increase integration evidence-supported behavioral health primary care service , compare simple co-location provider , improve patient-centered outcome patient multiple morbidity ? The key health decision affect research make practice level : whether best incorporate behavioral health ( BH ) service . At patient level , decision whether seek accept offer BH service influence manner make available . Aim 1 : Determine increase integration evidence-supported behavioral health primary care result well patient-centered outcome simple co-location behavioral provider without systematic integration . Aim 2 : Determine structure improvement process technique effective increase BH integration . Aim 3 : Explore contextual factor affect implementation patient-centeredness integrate BH care . This prospective , cluster-randomized , mixed method comparison co-location BH service vs. IBH use stepped-wedge design 30 primary care practice around US . Usual care ( control comparator ) practice attempt deliver BH service co-location BH clinician within adjacent primary care facility , without increase integration . The active comparator ( intervention ) Integrated Behavioral Health support delivery protocol support , step , data-driven , evidence-supported , BH care . In case , expense ( salary Behavioral Health Clinicians ) pay practice . The intervention consist train practice leader , Behavioral Health Clinicians , primary care provider , office staff , Structured Improvement Process support practice redesign , toolkit suggest tactic implement BH . The target patient population adult multiple comorbid medical behavioral problem receive service target practice setting : Family Medicine clinic , General Internal Medicine practice , Community Health Centers . The investigator enroll 30 practice around country represent broad spectrum US primary care sit include serve racial ethnic minority group , low-income group , woman , senior , resident rural area , patient special health need , disability , multiple chronic disease , low health literacy numeracy and/or limit English proficiency . The intervention direct practice impact measure randomly select sample 60 patient behavioral health need practice total 1800 patient follow 5 year . The primary outcome PROMIS-29 , patient-centered measure global health functioning . Secondary analysis assess outcome important patient well subgroup analysis allow exploration type patient practice benefit Integrated Behavioral Health . Aim 2 study effect intervention practice structure process . Aim 3 identify barrier support successful integration . The analysis Aims 1 2 use generalize linear mixed model patient health status perform intention-to-treat analysis function experimental condition ( co-location vs. integration ) , patient characteristic , time measurement , activation time ( randomize group ) multiple measure cluster within patient patient cluster within practice . The parameter interest central tendency ( mean ) , statistical significance ( P value ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) adjust change PROMIS-29 domain score since intervention . Inclusion activation time model account effect delay intervention outcome . Each 8 outcome domain PROMIS-29 model individually 8 separate hypothesis adjustment multiple comparison . Secondary outcome ( Communication , Empathy , Adherence , etc . ) use similar model . Aim 3 use mixed method analysis survey , focus group , key informant interview data source explore relationship context intervention patient-centeredness resultant care .</detailed_description>
