	<detailed_description>The study disclose patient present indication either abdominoplasty bilateral breast reduction Wise pattern skin excision ( inverted T inframammary scar ) Informed consent obtain volunteer next consultation , preoperative preparation finalise surgery book . Participants receive injection first time three week four month operation second time five nine day operation , tissue remove surgery . In session , one single access point , linear retrograde , subcutaneous injection perform 0,5 ml study hyaluronic acid gel , opposite direction , parallel skin surface . Both session monitor ultrasound examination . After injection , 2 cm inject area remote entrance point cannula remodelled finger pressure tissue pinching , simulate remodelling commonly perform filler injection . At begin operation , inject subcutaneous fat remove overlie skin , send histologic examination . The objective histologic examination ass tissue response one week versus three week four month injection , well assess spread product , without remodelling injection .</detailed_description>
