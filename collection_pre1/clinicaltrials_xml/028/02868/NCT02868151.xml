	<brief_title>Effect Oral Vitamin C Assessing Severity Oral Mucositis Chemoradiation Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis predictable unavoidable representation course radiotherapy employ treatment head neck cancer . The term oral mucositis use describe inflammation oral mucosa , separate entity distinct oral lesion pathogenic background generally summarize stomatitis . The cell line gastrointestinal tract mouth rectum especially vulnerable change . The incidence severity oral mucositis influence type antineoplastic treatment administer patient related factor . The pathogenesis radiation mucositis though completely understood , usually either direct DNA damage via indirect mechanism release free radical upon radiolysis water effect oral epithelium.It associate significant morbidity , pain , odynophagia , malnutrition thereby affect overall quality life patient carry important risk systemic infection particularly impair host defense setup.In addition acute damage wide range GI mucosal involvement occur radiotherapy . Various radiation modify agent use either selectively protect normal cell tumor cell therapeutic damage selectively enhance effect radiation tumor cell normal cell thereby improve efficacy radiation therapy . In spite extensive research find toxic . Antioxidants represent selective radiation modify agent non toxic human . However , many conflict hypothesis usage affect tumor response also decrease radiation induce toxicity normal cell , recommendation follow non usage chemo-radiotherapy . In spite reservation behalf oncologists 70 % patient antioxidant supplement contain vitamin A , vitamin C polar carotenoid without knowledge oncologist . Antioxidants neutralize free radical generate radio-chemo therapy enhance body 's antioxidant store order prevent mucositis maintain healthy oral tissue . Literature survey provide exhaustive list antioxidant successfully implicate control oral mucositis extent . Antioxidants beta carotene , vitamin E vitamin C combination , glutamine , glutathione study . Vitamin C water soluble nutrient wide antioxidant wound heal property . It widely scurvy patient effect conventional cancer therapy radiation chemotherapy little know . Limited preclinical data suggest vitamin high concentration increase toxicity certain chemotherapeutic drug animal . Recommended daily allowance ( RDA ) vitamin C 90mgper day men 75mg per day woman , upper limit 2000mg per day . Evidence point intake achieve therapeutic tissue concentration normal people several time higher RDA . Conversely recent study implicate danger consume high dos vitamin C may turn antioxidant pro oxidant interfere radiotherapy . However noted condition use study prevail invitro nature , reflect identical situation invivo . Few study believe enhance immune function increase natural killer cell lymphocyte activity . With controversial background paucity data human intervention , study undertaken evaluate effect vitamin c assess severity oral mucositis patient undergo cancer chemo radiotherapy concurrently</detailed_description>
