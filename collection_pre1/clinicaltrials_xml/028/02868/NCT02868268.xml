	<brief_summary>This proposal set forth platform Precision Medicine clinical trial New Approaches Neuroblastoma Therapy ( NANT ) consortium . The plan utilize NANT 's establish multi-institutional infrastructure Translational Genomics Research Institute GEM sequence platform acquisition gene panel sequence relapsed biological specimen relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma ( rNB ) include obtain bone , bone marrow soft tissue . Our primary aim identify subgroup rNB patient potentially targetable genetic ( ALK , MAPK pathway , Metabolic-related gene ) and/or immunologic ( tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and/or program death ligand [ PD-L1 ] expression ) biomarkers rNB . Additional potential novel biomarkers also evaluate report cohort patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma ( NB ) common extracranial solid tumor childhood . High-risk NB highly lethal responsible 15 % childhood cancer relate death . The majority patient metastatic NB respond upfront cytotoxic chemotherapy , yet patient die recurrent disease tumor acquire resistance treatment . Thus , understand repertoire tumor specific genomic alteration lead tumor progression therapy resistance critical devising novel target therapy option patient recurrent refractory ( r ) NB . Limited data exists regard genetic immunologic predictive biomarkers rNB , use direct targeted therapy . Another barrier clinical implementation genetic test tumor sample child rNB obtain sufficient number tumor cell bone marrow ( BM ) specimens , easily accessible common site relapse . This proposal set forth platform Precision Medicine clinical trial New Approaches Neuroblastoma Therapy ( NANT ) consortium . The plan utilize NANT 's establish multi-institutional infrastructure Translational Genomics Research Institute ( TGen ) GEMTM sequence platform acquisition gene panel sequence relapsed biological specimen rNB include obtain bone , bone marrow soft tissue . Our primary aim identify subgroup rNB patient potentially targetable genetic ( ALK , MAPK pathway , Metabolic-related gene ) and/or immunologic ( tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and/or PD-L1 expression ) biomarkers rNB . Additional potential novel biomarkers also evaluate report cohort patient . This aim immediate impact live child rNB provide clinical report patient physicians detail observed mutation rNB subgroup information clinical trial best match . Our second aim ass novel method enrich tumor cell bone marrow aspirate contain less 30 % tumor involvement next generation sequence perform . Our bone marrow ( BM ) enrichment protocol methodological patient significance ; 1 ) BM enrichment allow much large group rNB patient access future personalize medicine trial 2 ) Successful confirmation BM enrichment produce quality DNA genetic analysis serf proof principal method use genetic test BM evidence metastasis adult pediatric solid tumor . In summary , proposal define genetic immunologic landscape rNB contribute understanding ability therapeutically target dynamic alteration tumor biology child rNB .</detailed_description>
