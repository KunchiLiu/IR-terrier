	<brief_title>Optimization Spinal Manipulative Therapy Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) common costly condition . Spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) common mind body intervention individual LBP . Although SMT LBP examine numerous clinical study , literature SMT remain unclear even contradictory effectiveness treatment . Studies support SMT generally find relatively small treatment effect . Many reason offer inconsistent research literature small effect size SMT . A primary rationale offer SMT protocol use clinical research optimal , primarily due lack understand underlying mechanism explain clinical benefit SMT realize patient LBP . The prior work research team identify two mechanism explain therapeutic effect SMT . These effect reduction spinal stiffness improve activation lumbar multifidus muscle . This research also develop accurate , non-invasive method measure effect response SMT . The model identify two mechanism validate second patient sample . The overall goal proposal optimize SMT treatment protocols patient LBP . The optimization strategy study evaluate SMT combine treatment know modulate signal underlie clinical effect SMT assess mechanistic ( stiffness , lumbar multifidus activation ) patient-centered ( function pain ) outcomes . This project use innovative methodology efficiently evaluate effect various individual treatment component towards overall effect ; identify component contribute target outcome , , may discard . All participant provide 2 session SMT , randomize treatment group additional 3 week use factorial design stratify responder status order evaluate different combination intervention component ( muscle activation exercise , spinal mobilizing exercise , additional SMT ) work pathway modulate effect ( spinal stiffness muscle activation ) . Outcomes include spinal stiffness muscle activation measure well patient-reported outcome assessed baseline , 1 week , 4 week 3 month . Results project provide optimize SMT protocol ready application future randomize control trial examine efficacy effectiveness SMT .</detailed_description>
