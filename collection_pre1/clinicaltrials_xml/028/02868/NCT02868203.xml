	<brief_summary>This study evaluate completeness strut coverage vessel wall response , different time point ( 3-6-12 Months ) , follow CordimaxTM stent implantation patient non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OCT Based Edge In-stent Vascular Response After Cordimax Stent patIents With NSTE-ACS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major concern address delay heal process drug-eluting stent . To date study detail in-vivo completeness CordimaxTM stent coverage different time point . The objective prospective study measure completeness strut coverage vessel wall response ( neointima disomogeneity , acquire late incomplete strut apposition ) different time point follow CordimaxTM stent implantation , patient non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) detect small degree stent strut coverage accurately IVUS use different time point ( 3-6-12 Months )</detailed_description>
