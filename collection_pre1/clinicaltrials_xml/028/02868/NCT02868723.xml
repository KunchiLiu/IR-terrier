	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized 2 year study patient admit Hamad General Hospital ( HGH ) Stroke Prevention Clinic diagnosis ischemic stroke ( IS ) Transit ischemic attack ( TIAs ) . After sign informed consent form initial evaluation investigation , patient enrol two arm ( study arm control arm ) study follow one year ( monthly visit first three month follow visit three month completion study : total 6 follow visit ) pre-specified investigation repeat one year follow . In one arm ( control group ) , patient offer best risk factor management strategy currently practice stroke specialist HGH Qatar . And second ( subject group ) arm , assistance nurse-practitioner pharmacist , investigator make aggressive attempt meet `` target '' define risk factor evaluation investigation complete initial year cohort . All patient risk factor stratification accord Framingham Risk Score ( FRS ) change score measure time.The primary objective determine approach utilizes comprehensive strategy result significantly outcome . A clinically 'meaningful ' difference blood pressure ( BP ) lipid control 10 % aggressively manage versus patient treat standard care require minimum 200 patient group ( alpha error set 0.05 beta error 0.20 , power 80 % ) recruit 1 year follow one year ( total study duration 2 year ) . All patient screen magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( include gradient echo ( GRE ) sequence ) , carotid 3D Doppler measurement plaque volume , PAD assessment , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) evaluation protein urea baseline . These study repeat 1 year time exit study . The co-primary objective would monitor progression ( regression ) plaque build-up 3D Doppler image carotid artery two cohort . The investigator hypothesize aggressive management vascular risk factor `` recommend target level '' lead good vascular health . Compared current practice , comprehensive coordinate approach preventive measure lead patient well control blood pressure lipid level . Improved risk factor management result slow atherosclerosis downstream effect measurable sophisticated blood image test . Clinically translate few hospital re-admissions .</brief_summary>
