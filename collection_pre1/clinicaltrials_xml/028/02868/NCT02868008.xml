	<detailed_description>Microsurgical resection eloquent arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) remain challenge . Currently , two grade system concern pretreatment assessment brain AVMs : Spetzler-Martin grading system propose Spetzler Martin 1986 supplementary grade system propose Lawton 2010 . Controversies exist regard treatment timing treatment modality eloquent AVMs . Till , clinical trial concern efficacy multimodal magnetic resonance image technique assess surgical risk eloquent AVMs . The investigator assume multimodal imaging-based grading system superior classic Spetzler-Martin grading system supplementary grading system predict surgical risk eloquent AVMs . This study consist two part : retrospective analysis prospective study . Firstly , investigator retrospectively review 250 AVM patient surgically treat Beijing Tiantan Hospital June 2012 June 2015 . All data patient prospectively maintain AVM database . All patient preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study . The investigator collect patient demographic data , AVM feature , least distance AVMs activate cortex well fiber tract . The investigator also collect patient preoperative functional status ( modify Rankin scale score , mRS ) functional status ( mRS ) six month surgery . The change two functional status mRS classify two group : worsen mRS ( mRS score six month surgery - presurgical mRS score &gt; 0 ) unchanged improve mRS ( mRS score six month surgery - presurgical mRS score â‰¤0 ) . The new grading system propose base multimodal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The investigator compare predictive accuracy three grade system ( Spetzler-Martin grading system , supplementary system new grade system ) assess functional status ( worsen mRS ) . Then prospective study , investigator enroll 400 surgically treated AVM patient five neurosurgical center . All patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion . The preoperative preparation , surgical procedure , follow-up period , primary outcomes statistical analysis retrospective study part . Multimodal imaging-based system verify prospective phase . If result demonstrate multimodal MRI-based grading system superior Spetzler-Martin grading system supplementary system predict functional status six month AVM surgery , investigator propose new AVM grading system public .</detailed_description>
