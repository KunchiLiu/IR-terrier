	<brief_title>Study Immune Checkpoint Inhibition With Radiation Therapy Unresectable , Non-metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients unresectable , locally advanced adenocarcinoma pancreas receive Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) dose 6 Gy daily , 5 day . In Cohort A , MEDI4736 give , subject receive 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 every 2 week , day , first dose SBRT deliver ( within 4 hour ) . In Cohort B , tremelimumab give , subject receive 10 mg/kg tremelimumab every 4 week , day , first dose SBRT deliver ( within 4 hour ) . In Cohort C , MEDI4736 tremelimumab give combination , subject receive 10 mg/kg tremelimumab every 4 week , day , first dose SBRT deliver ( within 4 hour ) , follow 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 every 4 week . Correlative Studies The investigator evaluate immune change peripheral blood sample tumor biopsy fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) specimens pre- post- treatment 3 cohort involve combination stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) either ( A ) MEDI4736 alone , ( B ) tremelimumab alone , ( C ) combination MEDI4736 tremelimumab . FNA biopsies do baseline ( within 30 day treatment initiation ) Day 28 cycle 2 ( day 22-28 cycle 2 ) .</detailed_description>
