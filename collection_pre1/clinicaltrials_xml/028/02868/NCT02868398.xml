	<brief_summary>This study monitor efficacy safety Golimumab maintain deep remission quality life Ulcerative Colitis patient deep prolonged remission Infliximab . Patients follow one year assess biochemical test ( C-Reactive Protein , Full Blood Count , Faecal Calprotectin ) , endoscopic evaluation ( MAYO Score ) finally histologically .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Golimumab Maintaining Deep Remission UC Patients Prolonged Remission With Infliximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic idiopathic relapsing-remitting continuously active inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) almost exclusively affect colonic mucosa . Acute severe flare UC may lead onto potential lethal complication , massive haemorrhage , toxic megacolon , peritonitis , colectomy whereas chronic active disease may lead functional failure large bowel , dysplasia colorectal cancer . Traditional therapeutic target , normalization stool absence rectal bleeding , longer consider sufficient prevent aforementioned long term sequela uncontrolled colonic inflammation . Thus , new therapeutic target emerge aim achieve optimal long-term outcome UC . Along line , therapy move mere control symptom towards global control inflammation achieve maintain long-term complete clinical remission ( relief abdominal pain , normalization stool , cessation rectal bleeding ) , normalization serologic ( white blood cell C-Reacting Protein ) faecal marker inflammation ( calprotectin ) , endoscopic ( normal look mucosa ) histologic remission ( absence acute chronic inflammation biopsy affect colonic area ) . This composite definition remission ( namely 'complete ' 'deep ' remission ) consist appropriate patient report outcomes ( PROs ) objective marker intestinal inflammation may associate improved long-term outcome disease , prevention complication , hospitalization , colectomy , avoidance disability maintenance least near-normal patient quality life . This composite clinical biological remission along mucosal heal histologic remission consider realistic therapeutic goal . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion willing participate receive golimumab therapy subcutaneously 1 year . Patients follow outpatient IBD Clinic 3-month interval usual practice department . At visit patient undergo clinical evaluation use Partial Mayo score , physical examination , monitor body weight body mass index , routine laboratory test include routine clinical practice treatment biologic agent IBD ( FBC , Estimated Sedimentation Rate , CRP , Liver Function Tests , Urea , Creatinine , serum glucose electrolyte , faecal calprotectin ) order ensure effectiveness safety treatment . In visit , patient fill questionnaires assess quality life , disability , work productivity , satisfaction therapy . The daily bowel frequency , rectal bleeding , presence grade abdominal pain overall subjective condition patient 's general health visit record daily pre-administered diary . After 1 year golimumab administration patient re-evaluated endoscopy biopsy order define percentage patient remain deep remission . For patient present flare disease 1 year follow , treatment individualize depend severity flare .</detailed_description>
