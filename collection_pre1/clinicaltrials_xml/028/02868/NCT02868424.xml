	<detailed_description>This study perspective , single-arm open-labeled investigation safety preliminary efficacy unilateral subretinal transplantation fRPE cell subject dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . The investigator recruit enroll 6 patient base specific inclusive/exclusive criterion . Experimental self-controlled eye determine base best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) . The eye BCVA le 20/400 determined experimental eye , undergo subretinal injection 100,000 fRPE cell , one ( BCVA equal 20/400 ) control eye , receive surgery . fRPE cell obtain fetus abort Department Obstetrics Gynecology Jiangsu Province Hospital 2015 2018 . The obtained fRPE cell meet specific inclusive/exclusive criterion conform Good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . fRPE transplant board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon , administer subretinal space experimental eye standard surgical approach . Immunosuppressive agent administer orally subject transplantation . Dosage time duration immunosuppressive agent regulate strictly rely condition immune rejection . Subjects monitor ophthalmologic systemic examination frequently regular post-transplant interval fRPE cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
