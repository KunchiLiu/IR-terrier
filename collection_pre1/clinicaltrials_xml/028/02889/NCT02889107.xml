	<brief_title>Auditory Rehabilitation Stroke Patients With Auditory Processing Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke affect level auditory pathway . Approximately one five stroke survivor report severe difficulty listen speech-in-noise , despite normal hearing , attribute abnormal processing sound within brain , individual likely experience communication difficulty poor acoustic environment , The patient significant auditory deficit functional limitation may require range rehabilitation remediation approach . Several study conclusively demonstrate substantial improvement speech recognition noise use personal frequency-modulated ( FM ) system . These device use improve speech perception noise adult neurological disorder include stroke good immediate benefit . However , long-term benefit FM system stroke patient study . In research study investigator aim investigate long term benefit speech reception noise non-aphasic stroke patient measure potential improvement unaided speech background noise performance 10 week .</detailed_description>
