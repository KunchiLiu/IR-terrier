	<brief_title>High-intensity Training Enriched Environment Late Phase After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The brain limited ability repair . However , recent year become evident remarkable , yet restrict ability regeneration neuronal connection exists , positive implication rehabilitation individual stroke . Several study show stroke-lesioned animal , expose call enrich environment ( large cage , group housing animal , equip toys possibility physical activity social interaction ) show sign tissue regeneration/plasticity brain . Research show rat expose enriched environment recover significantly faster stroke rat standard cage , despite fact total tissue loss rat differ . Recovery improvement motor function skill stroke depend spontaneous repair process also reorganization neural mechanism stimuli demand place motor control system . In spite numerous research study show functional recovery stroke possible even many year stroke onset , unusual stroke victim offer kind rehabilitation later stage . High quality randomize controlled trial field need well pre-clinical study exercise-induced mechanism order establish alternative therapeutic approach individual history stroke . No previous study evaluate effect high-intensity , task-specific , goal-directed training combine enriched environment , individual late phase stroke . The aim project investigate whether possible improve functioning activity level individual 6 month stroke partake rehabilitation program consist high-intensity task-specific , goal-directed training enrich environment . The specific research question : A . What impact high intensity task specific goal-directed training combine environmental enrichment individual late phase stroke ? B . What subject ' experience rehabilitation program ? C. What biomarkers successful stroke recovery ? D. How intervention effect subject ' walk ability detail level ? The study single blind randomize controlled trial cross-over design , approximately 36 individual late phase stroke include . Participants randomize either intervention control group . The intervention take place rehabilitation facility south Spain . The main reason choose location rehab facility Sweden provide environment stable condition outdoor activity sensory stimulation . The control group ( home environment ) offer kind organize intervention allow continue conventional treatment , engage example physiotherapeutic training , occupational speech therapy maximum 3 hours/week . After control period , control group partake rehabilitation program . The physical evaluation perform Sweden prior intervention 6 month completion intervention / control period . In addition , three-month follow-up form questionnaire perform . The primary outcome measure : Modified Motor Assessment Scale accord Uppsala University Hospital ( M-MAS UAS ) ( measure motor function ) Secondary outcome measure measure walk ability , speed endurance , dynamic static balance , fine motor speed dexterity upper limb , motor speed gross manual dexterity , hand strength , satisfaction life whole , perceive confidence task performance , health-related quality life degree depression . Focus group interview individual interview conduct subgroup participant ( non aphasic participant ) statement analyze qualitative use content analysis method . Blood sample take analysis biomarkers , growth factor inflammatory marker . Advanced analyse gait pattern component perform motor laboratory , include subgroup participant . In rehabilitation medicine , general belief treatment individual late phase stroke functional impact . The present research program test hypothesis control clinical trial patient 6 month stroke . The biochemical analysis blood sample additional preclinical study directly knowledge possibility enhance brain plasticity also later phase stroke . The research contribute strengthen evidence promise rehabilitation approach combine element focus high-intensity training environmental enrichment strong empirical support .</detailed_description>
