	<brief_summary>This Before-and-after Controlled Study study evaluate clinical impact parathyroid autofluorescence visualization use near infrared light ( NIR ) total thyroidectomy ( TT ) . It compare two group consecutive patient underwent TT associate lymph node dissection ( LND ) without intraoperative use NIR , surgeon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Impact Parathyroid Autofluorescence Visualization During Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total thyroidectomy ( TT ) responsible postoperative hypocalcemia 20-30 % patient , definitive 1-4 % operated patient ( 1 ) . This complication mainly due surgery-induced parathyroid dysfunction , could improve well intraoperative identification parathyroid . Intraoperative parathyroid auto-fluorescence visualization ( without dye injection ) use near infrared light ( NIR ) emerge technique , allow correct identification normal parathyroid almost case ( 2 ) , clinical impact NIR unknown . The main objective study assess impact intraoperative use NIR camera postoperative hypocalcemia . Secondary objective assess impact NIR visualization , autotransplantation inadvertent resection rate TT . The investigator compare 2 group patient operate one surgeon 2 consecutive distinct period ( use NIR ) control group operate another surgeon period . This study observational since predefined protocol sample size calculation study group prior data collection .</detailed_description>
