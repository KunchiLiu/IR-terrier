	<detailed_description>Acute Renal Failure ( ARF ) define severe , usually reversible , glomerular filtration rate decreasing . Beside frequency , ARF may associate severe prognostic . Thus , patient admit ICU suffer ARF require dialysis , high risk mortality 50 % . Tubulointerstitial nephropathy , particularly Acute Tubular Necrosis ( ATN ) remain major cause ARF , represent 45-50 % case . The ATN due suffer destruction tubular cell sensitive ischemia-reperfusion lesion tubular reabsorption function require significant constant energy intake . However , ATN represent relatively homogeneous group term acute kidney disease typology . Homogeneity significant frequency compels ATN optimal model study function recovery ARF . ARF constitute major public health issue . Actually , incidence Chronic Renal Failure ( CRF ) ARF , due ATN , estimate 19 % 31 % . In addition 12.5 % patient specific ARF presentation immediately reach End-stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) , occurrence ARF require dialysis , triple risk chronic renal support . Therefore , predict progression ARF towards CRF appear essential . At time , investigator currently lack reliable biomarkers predict progression . This pejorative kidney development due persistence intrarenal inflammation , rapid development interstitial fibrosis deficiency tubular restoration . It involve complex mechanism inflammatory response , vascular tubular remodel . Two promise biomarkers renal fibrosis , ARF occurrence CRF progression risk appear recent year : Procollagen III N-terminal peptide ( PIIINP ) neutrophil gelatinase associate lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The investigator believe PIIINP urinary NGAL may constitute robust biomarkers progression ( ) towards CRF ARF context . Firstly , PIIINP good reflection fibrosis process inside kidney . Secondarily , NGAL marker renal tubule remodel renal aggression . The combination two biomarkers could therefore efficiently reflect balance tubular fibrosis/restoration may allow optimal prediction renal function recovery . The investigator hypothesize two biomarkers may use ass risk CRF progression ARF ATN context .</detailed_description>
