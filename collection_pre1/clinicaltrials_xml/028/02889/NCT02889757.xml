	<brief_summary>Animal study show INH-RIF-induced oxidative injury prevent support cellular antioxidant defense mechanism N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . However , publish data large sample size regard protective effect NAC hepatotoxicty induce anti-TB drug human , knowledge . Therefore , investigator design clinical trial aim see whether NAC could protect anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity ( DIH )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Isoniazid ( INH ) , rifampicin ( RIF ) , pyrazinamide ( PZA ) , first-line drug use tuberculosis ( TB ) chemotherapy , associate hepatotoxicity . A high rate hepatotoxicity report develop country compare advanced country similar dose schedule . Sharifzadeh et al . report incidence 27.7 % Iran . The reason high rate hepatotoxicity completely clear . Ethnic variation , advanced age , female sex , alcoholism , underlie liver disease , acetylator phenotype , hepatitis B C virus , HIV infection , extensive pulmonary parenchymal disease , hypoalbuminemia observe risk factor development drug-induced hepatotoxicity ( DIH ) anti-TB treatment . The mechanism DIH induce anti-TB treatment yet fully understood . Sodhi et al . propose oxidative stress one likely mechanisms INH-RIF-induced hepatic injury . It well establish augment cellular antioxidative defense system , especially nonprotein thiols , , glutathione ( GSH ) , cell protect oxidative injury produce various drug chemical . The study perform randomized trial assessment protective effect liver function patient receive anti-TB agent use NAC .</detailed_description>
