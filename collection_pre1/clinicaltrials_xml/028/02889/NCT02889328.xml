	<brief_summary>Randomized , placebo-controlled , phase III study regorafenib 160 mg daily intermittent dose schedule 3 week treatment follow 1 week demonstrate significant benefit regorafenib term PFS patient GISTs fail imatinib sunitinib . However , concern tumor tumor-related symptom may progress treatment period . Investigators hypothesize continuous dose schedule regorafenib might feasible effective prevent disease flare off-treatment period . Based result previous dose escalation study continuous regorafenib dosing , investigate 100 mg daily dose regorafenib patient TKI-refractory GISTs .</brief_summary>
