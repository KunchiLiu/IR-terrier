	<brief_summary>Management complex airway stenosis dedicate tailored stent work 3D computer-assisted conception Dedicated Airway Stents Central Airway Stenoses DASCAS Toulouse University Hospital sponsor research . This research conduct support AnatomikModeling ADERSPOT - Background : Tracheobronchial stent device design manage central airway stenoses various origin . Their shape size however suitable stenosis complex anatomy . - Purpose : The investigator propose test feasibility safety treat complex airway stenosis dedicate tailored stent work 3D computer-assisted conception Abstract : Central airway obstruction currently manage non-personalized stent , usually efficient lead severe potentially lethal complication 10 % case ( stent migration , obstructive granuloma , perforation , hemoptysis ) . These stent seem particularly unsuited anatomically complex stenosis . Dedicated airway stent ( wrought tailor 3D computer-assisted conception base 3D chest CT-scan ) , fit perfectly tracheal bronchial anatomy , dramatically improve tolerance safety prostheses . This first feasibility study , dedicate patient suffer anatomically complex stenosis test safety treat patient new approach . It lead large study evaluate new type stent large indication . After 3D computer-assisted modelization airway , virtual prosthesis shape design shape stent work 3D-machining AnatomikModeling® . The stent build sterilize Sebbin® inserted rigid bronchoscopy term pre-existing model . Close follow conduct , include clinical evaluation one week , three six month ; spirometry one week 6 month chest CT-scan one week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Prospective monocentric feasibility study Arm number label arm type : Only one experimental arm Interventions : After signature inform consent Collection clinical data ( age , sex , etiology , site mechanism stenosis , previous treatment dyspnea , quality life ( VQ11 questionnaire ) ) Chest CT-scan without contrast continuous positive pressure Spirometry ( peak flow , FEV1 ) Computer-assisted modelization shape prosthesis use 3D reconstruction CT-scan Machining shape Ertacetal® ( AnatomikModeling® ) Fabrication sterilization stent silicon ( Sebbin® ) Insertion stent rigid bronchoscopy general anesthesia Clinical follow-up one week , 3 month 6 month Chest CT-scan without contrast 1 week , spirometry 1 week 6 month Number subject : 10 patient Statistical analysis : For primary outcome , percentages procedure conduct without complication 1 week , 3 month , 6 month confidence interval 95 % incidence 1 week , 3 month 6 month complication calculate . For secondary outcome : - Percentages procedure conduct improvement dyspnea ( improvement least one point NYHA score ) 1 week , 3 month , 6 month confidence interval 95 % calculate . - Percentages procedure conduct improvement quality life ( improvement least 10 % VQ11 score ) 1 week , 3 month , 6 month confidence interval 95 % calculate . - Percentages procedure conduct improvement functional parameter ( improvement least 20 % DEP FEV1 ) 1 week 6 month confidence interval 95 % calculate . - Percentage procedure conduct radiologic congruence stent 1 week confidence interval 95 % calculate .</detailed_description>
