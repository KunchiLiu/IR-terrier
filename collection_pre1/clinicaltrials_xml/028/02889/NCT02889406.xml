	<brief_summary>In recent study , demonstrate motivational therapy approach treat childhood obesity highly effective clinical metabolic level . This efficacy prove clinical outpatient setting . However , standardize collaborative approach clinic primary care service would allow faster easy approach childhood obesity treatment . Furthermore , motivational educational intervention would benefit current technologic facility , long term effect education group level , term food shopping plan , healthy , fast cheap cooking method would useful specially low income family ( high prevalence childhood obesity ) . The aim study assess clinical metabolic efficacy family intervention , coordinate clinical primary care service Tarragona health-care region , use motivational therapy individual group level , involve e-Health tool ( wearable ) , focus family 8 13 year old obese child . The design cluster randomize control trial , intervention group receive multicomponent motivational educational plan compare control group receive usual recommendation perform primary care centre ( n=167 per group ) . The treatment study group last 12 month perform primary care centre . In parallel , study team validate methodology use ass body composition obese child well change produce intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MAIN OBJECTIVE To evaluate effectiveness motivational intervention treatment childhood obesity , coordinate primary care specialize service , multicomponent , integrate technique fast healthy cook eHealth tool ( wearable ) , compare usual intervention perform paediatrics . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 1 . To evaluate effectiveness multicomponent motivational intervention compare usual intervention perform regular paediatrics clinical practice 1 . On BMI control obese child 8 13 year old 2 . On metabolic control obese child 8 13 year old , 3 . On increase physical activity obese child 8 13 year old , 4 . On acquire healthy eat pattern obese child 8 13 year old . 2 . To establish methodological background implantation motivational intervention coordinate primary care service specialize service . 3 . To validate use bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) follow treatment childhood obesity compare four-compartment model body composition . 5 . METHODOLOGY 5.1 Design Randomized control clinical trial cluster , intervention group ( IG ) receive 12 month motivational counselling , together workshop focus family nutrition education technique fast healthy cook physical activity ; eHealth tool ( wearable ) support ; control group ( CG ) follow usual recommendation . 5.2 STUDY POPULATION The Health Region Tarragona include population 600,000 people ( 36,000 child 8 13 year ) . With regard 6.6 % childhood obesity prevalence country ( Schroder 2014 ) , estimate eligible population 2376 obese child age 8-13 year old . 5.3 SAMPLE SIZE The number individual simple random design , multiplied design effect consider calculate sample size stratum ( Basic Care Unit ) . Accepting alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.2 bilateral contrast , 98 subject need group detect difference equal great 0.36 unit BMI z-score . It assume common standard deviation 0.75 . A 30 % lose follow rate ( GRANMO 7.12 ) estimate . To calculate design effect , estimate intracluster correlation coefficient cluster randomize trial primary care generally low 0.05 . The effect design correspond 1.7 . Assuming value , final size study sample would 167 subject group ( 12 individual primary care centre , 15 basic care unit ( BCUs ) ) . 5.4 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Basic Care Units ( BCU ) doctor-nurse unit randomization . Randomization 1 : 1 make EPIDAT 3.0 statistical program . Given nature intervention participant researcher blind . Professional charge statistical analysis blind well .</detailed_description>
