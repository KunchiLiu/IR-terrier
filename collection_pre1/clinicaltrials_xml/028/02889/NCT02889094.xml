	<brief_title>French HIV-HBV Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The French HIV-HBV Cohort observational , non-interventional study include 308 HIV-infected patient chronic HBV infection ( HBsAg-positive serology &gt; 6 month ) seven clinical center . Patients recruit 2002-2003 follow prospectively every three twelve month , two phase , 2010-2011 . Extensive information variety HIV- HBV-related parameter collect study visit . This particular study aim extend follow-up French HIV-HBV Cohort use different type design . Patients complete least one study phase French HIV-HBV Cohort select participation . Patients continue follow-up participate clinical center ask undergo routine clinical visit , time medical data year since last cohort visit routine visit extract . For died , information year since last cohort visit death collect . The primary objective cohort extension understand reason clinical implication persistent HBV infection patient co-infected HIV HBV era highly effective antiviral treatment virus . The following secondary objective follow : - To establish extent persistent viremia ( PV ) HBV , quantify either serum within hepatocyte - To understand whether persistence effect clinically-relevant serological outcome ( i.e . HBeAg HBsAg seroclearance seroconversion along HBsAg quantification ) prolong follow-up - To quantify evolution liver fibrosis use non-invasive method , small subset patient , liver biopsy , investigate virological immunological factor associate progression regression - To describe cause liver-related non-liver-related morbidity mortality direct effect persistent HBV DNA replication outcome</detailed_description>
