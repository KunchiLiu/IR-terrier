	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , observational study collection de-identified biospecimens clinical data least 10,000 participant clinical network United States . The study enroll least 7000 cancer subject multiple solid tumor type ( CANCER arm ) least 3000 representative subject without clinical diagnosis cancer ( NON-CANCER arm ) . Cancer subject new diagnosis prior systemic therapy recruit . Clinical data relevant cancer status collect participant medical record baseline , subsequently medical record intermittent future time point , least annually 5 year . The study test ( ) use protocol next generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based assay ( ) investigation development GRAIL .</detailed_description>
