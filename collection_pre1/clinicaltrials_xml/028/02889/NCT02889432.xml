	<detailed_description>Background : Orthognathic surgery commonly accept treatment modality management dentofacial deformity . Although many case , satisfying , excellent , aesthetic functional result obtain orthognathic surgery , without risk ; one prevalent long-term complication encounter neurosensory disturbance either inferior alveolar nerve infraorbital nerve depend jaw receive osteotomy . A systematic review JÄ™drzejewski et al . 2015 report cranial nerve injury/sensitivity alteration common complication orthognathic surgery see 50 % case , almost patient report alter sensation immediate post-operative period . Although decrease time , Henzelka et al . report 3 % incidence paresthesia inferior alveolar nerve 1 year post-surgery , Thygesen et al . report sensory change infraorbital nerve 7 60 % patient depend site measurement 1 year post-surgery . In Hong Kong , 10-year retrospective study 581 patient Lee et al . 2013 report 5.9 % rate neurosensory disturbance 1-year post-orthognathic surgery . Of case , majority affect inferior alveolar nerve , combination ramus osteotomies together anterior mandibular osteotomy significantly increase chance permanent neurosensory disturbance . Biosynthesis Melatonin : Melatonin ( N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine ) neurohormone endogenously produce secrete pineal gland brain circadian rhythm , plasma concentration high night low day . Its normal physiological role human regulate diurnal rhythm , sleep , mood , immunity , reproduction , intestinal motility , metabolism . Oral exogenous melatonin use management jetlag sleep disorder . Recently , animal human study show melatonin improve tolerance tourniquet pain patient receive hand surgery perform regional anaesthesia , improve dyspnea patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , neuroprotective neuroregenerative effect nerve injury . Pharmacology Melatonin : ) Bioavailability : The absorption bioavailability oral intake Melatonin vary greatly . Absorption Melatonin range complete young patient decrease approximately 50 % elderly . Bioavailability usually approximately 15 % due variation first-pass metabolism . Peak value ususally observe 60 - 150min oral consumption . When apply topically skin , found topical application 0.01 % Melatonin cream increase serum level Melatonin mean 4.9pg/mL pre-application 5.1pg/mL 1-hour post-application 8.1pg/mL 8-hours post-application , 9.0pg/mL 24-hours post-application . ii ) Distribution : Melatonin highly lipid-soluble protein bind capacity approximately 60 % . In vitro , Melatonin show mainly bind albumin , alpha1-acid glycoprotein high-density lipoprotein . Due high lipid-solubility , Melatonin ability cross membrane barrier , include blood-brain barrier placenta find saliva , serum , urine oral administration . Melatonin receptor find many tissue throughout body . iii ) Biotransformation Excretion : Melatonin mainly hydroxylated cytochrome P450 ( CYP1A2 ) liver 6-hydroxymelatonin small amount serotonin metabolites cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin indolinone tautomer 2-hydroxymelatonin . These conjugated sulfate glucuronide conjuates excrete urine . Usages Melatonin : Aside regulate sleep diurnal rhythm , exogenous Melatonin recently prove animal study randomize controlled trial human beneficial many area medicine surgery , mostly hypothesize due antioxidative property reduce inflammatory mediator . A randomized control trial Mowafi Ismail 2008 show patient require hand surgery use tourniquet regional anaesthesia , pre-medication 10mg oral Melatonin 90 minute surgery significanly reduce verbal pain score tourniquet pain compare placebo group . The time first dose post-operative analgesic request significantly longer Melatonin group amount post-operative analgesic consumption Melatonin group also significantly low . No significant difference incidence adverse effect Melatonin placebo group report study . Animal study show neuroregenerative neuroprotective effect Melatonin . In controlled study rat , Atik et al . show Melatonin beneficial promoting nerve recovery high dos . In study , tibial peroneal branch sciatic nerve dissect subsequently coapt prolene suture . Post-trauma , 10mg/kg Melatonin inject intraperitoneally 21 day . Histologically , rat receive Melatonin exhibit less endoneural collagen well organizad collagen along repair line nerve . There also few demyelinized axon . By 12 week post-trauma , walk track analysis show significantly good function Melatonin group measure sciatic function index ( SFI ) . Electrophysiological finding show 12 week post-trauma , latency significantly less Melatonin group , whilst action potential amplitude nerve conduction velocity significantly high Melatonin group compare control group . It conclude study high dos Melatonin significant beneficial effect nerve recovery measure functionally , histopathologically , electrophysiologically . In another control study rat , Kaya et al . show beneficial effect Melatonin cut crush injure sciatic nerve . In study Melatonin administer intraperitoneally dose 50mg/kg/day 6 week post-trauma . In term SFI value , Melatonin treatment accelerate recovery process reach -50 SFI level 3rd week , compare placebo group , reach SFI level 6th week . Histologically , rat treat Melatonin show well strutural preservation myelin sheath compare control group . Biochemically , beneficial effect Melatonin comfirmed show low lipid peroxidation high superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase activity sciatic nerve sample compare control group . Similar beneficial effect report Zencirci et al . study Melatonin peripheral nerve crush injury rat . In study , rat allocate control group treatment group , divide group receive 5mg/kg intraperitoneal Melatonin 21 day post-trauma , another group receive 20mg/kg length time . Again , show increase SFI value injure sciatic nerve treat Melatonin compare control group . Electrophysiological measurement show Melatonin treatment decease latency value increase conduction velocity . However , mention whether significant difference observe group receive 5mg/kg Melatonin 20mg/kg Melatonin . Fujimoto et al . also able show potent protective effect Melatonin spinal cord injury . In study , experimental ischemic-induced spinal cord injury inflict rat . Subesequently , rat either place control group receive 2.5mg/kg Melatonin inject intraperitoneally 5 minute , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 hour injury . It find Melatonin reduce occurrence neutrophil-induced lipid peroxidation . Melatonin also reduce thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content myeloperoxidase activity , responsible motor deficit . Histologically , finding Melatonin group show less cavity formation control group .</detailed_description>
