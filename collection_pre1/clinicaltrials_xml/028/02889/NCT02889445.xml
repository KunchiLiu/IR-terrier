	<brief_title>A Phase I Study DM-CHOC-PEN Pediatric Adolescent Subjects With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal Phase I pediatric oncology clinical trial evaluate safety use 4-demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine ( DM-CHOC-PEN ) , anticancer therapy child advance cancer involve central nervous system ( CNS ) . DM-CHOC-PEN polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , accumulate CNS tumor tissue human produce objective response , acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicity ( patient prior liver disease ) evidence hematological , renal , neuro-toxicities improve quality life overall survival adult Phase I/II clinical trial - IND - 68,876 ( 1-6 ) . The FDA support propose Phase I clinical trial design identify safety , toxicity acceptable MTD child CNS cancer , adult Phase I trial complete acceptable toxicity MTDs identify ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 ) . Primary malignant cancer central nervous system ( CNS ) account le 2 % malignancy , yet brain tumor 2nd common cause death child ( 7 ) . Some childhood malignancy , e.g. , intrinsic diffuse pontine glioma - locate surgery attempt ( 8 ) . A critical component design agent cross protective blood brain barrier ( BBB ) agent must readily transport intracerebrally , produce local irritation/neurotoxicity recycle back general circulation . After IV administration DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrate BBB , substrate transporter protein P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) show anticancer activity CNS tumor ( 4 ) . The effective transport DM-CHOC-PEN CNS tumor adult without neurotoxic behavioral alteration associate event support drug 's use child CNS tumor age brain development maturation still active cognitive lability . The observed response note adult metastatic cancer involve CNS cerebellum treat DM-CHOC-PEN ( Table 1 ) may also occur medulloblastoma , primitive cerebellar tumor neuroectodermal origin , 2nd common brain tumor child ( 7 , 9 ) . Thus , drug 's unique property lack toxicity note adult study merit Phase I trial propose child . The specific objectives Phase I study : 1 . Conduct Phase I clinical trial DM-CHOC-PEN child advance cancer involve central nervous system document toxicity , define acceptable maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , identify anticancer activity drug . All data communicate e-RAP program . This accomplish IND - 68.876 . 2 . Studying pharmacokinetic/dynamic profile DM-CHOC-PEN metabolites child advance cancer involve central nervous system . 3 . Analyze data prepare Phase II clinical trial child FDA review .</detailed_description>
