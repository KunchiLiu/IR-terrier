	<brief_summary>Chronically photodamaged skin visually characterized dryness , wrinkle , brown spot , leathery appearance , etc . This happen result excessive exposure UV light sun . While sun 's exposure leave skin 's surface visibly change , skin 's unseen immune system may also permanently alter result exposure , make likely develop variety skin cancer infection . This study examine lasting change immune system skin cause UV exposure . Investigators stimulate different aspect skin 's immune system give injection Candida Albicans ( CANDIN® ) histamine phosphate ( HISTATROL® ) , topical application imiquimod 5 % cream ( ALDARA® ) perform tape strip procedure adhesive tape . The use Candida Albicans ( CANDIN® ) , histamine phosphate ( HISTATROL® ) , tape strip common procedure clinical setting stimulate skin desire skin response . Imiquimod 5 % cream ( ALDARA® ) FDA-approved drug treatment basal cell carcinoma , actinic keratoses genital wart . Investigators compare reaction skin 's immune system cellular level skin normally expose sun exposure area normally hidden sun exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronically photodamaged skin visually characterized dryness , wrinkle , brown spot , leathery appearance , etc . While photodamage leave skin 's surface visibly change , skin 's unseen immune system may also permanently alter result exposure , make likely develop variety skin cancer infection . This study aim evaluate lasting change lifetime UV exposure cause different component skin 's immune system chronically sun damage skin ( forearm ) compare sun-protected skin ( buttock ) . Investigators compare cellular response stimulation skin 's innate immune system , skin 's adaptive immune system , skin 's hypersensitivity responses two site . In order stimulate different arm immune system , investigator use follow intervention : intradermal injection Candida Albicans antigen , intradermal injection histamine phosphate , topical application imiquimod 5 % cream , tape strip procedure adhesive tape . Skin test C. albicans antigen useful procedure measure capacity person manifest delayed-type hypersensitivity response commonly use clinical setting evaluate cellular immunity . Similarly , histamine phosphate frequently use positive control clinical test ass type I Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -mediated hypersensitivity reaction . Imiquimod 5 % cream direct stimulator toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 7 , key component innate immune response downstream signal effect involve adaptive immune response . It FDA-approved treatment superficial basal cell carcinoma , actinic keratoses , genital wart . Finally , tape strip validated procedure use remove superficial layer epidermis clinical study environment . Objective : This mechanism action pilot study design characterize molecular nature local innate adaptive immune response chronically photodamaged skin ( forearm ) compare photoprotected skin ( buttock ) use non-photodamaged individual ( forearm buttock ) control . Population : Adult subject without photodamage enter study University Michigan . Procedures : study intervention ( tape stripping , candida albicans histamine phosphate injection , imiquimod 5 % cream application ) , photography , Chroma Meter reading , biopsy , skin assessment</detailed_description>
