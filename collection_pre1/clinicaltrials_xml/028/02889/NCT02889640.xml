	<brief_title>Increasing Reach Promising Dropout Prevention Programs : Examining Trade-offs Between Scale Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The University Chicago Education Lab research team carry randomize controlled trial 2016-2017 academic year build previous collaboration Chicago Public Schools ( CPS ) SAGA Innovations find SAGA 's intensive , individualized , during-the-school-day tutor generate large gain academic outcome short period time , even among student many year behind grade level . This research suggest promise approach improve academic skill educational attainment disadvantage youth , even reach adolescence , Chicago distress urban district across country . However , truly affect outcome local national level , SAGA would roll much great scale researcher able study Chicago . Yet little known take promising intervention scale . This study seek build science scale-up , examine extent individualized tutor program implement even great scale explicitly explore trade-offs effectiveness scale . The SAGA Innovations program expand nationally recognize innovation high-dosage , in-school-day tutoring develop Match Education 's charter school Boston . The tutor program meet schedule course , Math Lab , day normal school day , provide addition student 's regular math class . Students take course receive elective credit upon completion . Students work two-on-one ( two student one tutor ) full-time , professional tutor entirety school year . The content tutor session align student learn regular math course , also target address individual gap math knowledge . Also follow original model develop Match Education , SAGA tutor use frequent internal formative assessment student progress individualize instruction . A previous randomized control trial conduct University Chicago research team find one year intervention , deliver AY2013-14 , generate one two extra year academic growth math , normal U.S. high school student learn one year ( Cook et al. , 2015 ; Reardon 2011 ) . The estimated effect math achievement order 0.19 0.30 SD , depend exact test norming use . This effect equivalent closing one-third black-white test score gap math NAEP among thirteen-year-olds ( 0.80 SD ) , one year . The intervention also improve student grade math 0.58 point 1-4 grade point scale , compare control mean 1.77 . These gain particularly important grow evidence importance math specifically short- medium-term success school , long-term life outcome employment earnings ( Duncan et al. , 2007 ) . This study aim build upon investigator ' previous evaluation program , provide insight ability program serve youth much large scale . The investigator take advantage power random sample study scale-up program without actually implement program much large scale . For example , 2016-17 academic year , SAGA serve 1,200 kid Chicago Public Schools , need hire 100 tutor . Researchers believe simulate range tutor SAGA would need hire deliver much large scale Chicago—say , 3,000 student . To serve 3,000 student , SAGA would hire 250 tutor . To hire 250 tutor , SAGA would typically recruit pool 2,000 applicant , 1,000 would deem qualified enough interview . To simulate hire process tutor SAGA would hire serve 3,000 student , researcher SAGA recruit target 1,000 interview-able applicant , randomly select one five actually interview . SAGA offer position top 50 candidate pool 200 interview . Simulations suggest approach provide unbiased estimate 250 tutor would hire program implement five time propose scale . SAGA staff also rank 50 tutor ( hereby refer `` scale-up tutor '' ) base expect success improve academic outcome student , enable researcher examine extent tutor rank moderate program effect . SAGA responsible recruitment tutor , use standard recruitment method ( career fair , job posting , online advertisement , etc . ) reach anticipate 1,000 interview-able applicant . SAGA also select another set 50 tutor via standard hire process ( hereby refer `` standard tutor '' ) , involve randomization . These 50 standard tutor allow investigator compare effectiveness SAGA tutoring implement small versus large scale . The school study also divide two set , base whether SAGA tutor implement past . In half school , SAGA-style tutoring implement since AY2013-14 AY2014-15 , researcher allow school choose student believe participate tutoring . In second half school , never implement SAGA-style tutoring , investigator administer program randomize controlled trial , identify youth elevate risk fail academically randomly assign one two conditions—SAGA tutoring , control group receive status quo school community service . In set school , student assign tutor randomly assign particular tutor school . For scale-up tutor , random assignment student tutor couple randomization tutor selection allow researcher examine impact individualize tutor 250 tutor hire , enable researcher empirically estimate supply curve implement individualized tutor program much large scale . For standard tutor , random assignment student tutor allow researcher examine effect implement individualized tutor small scale , 50 tutor hire . At end AY2016-17 , researcher examine impact program important academic behavioral outcome . This include outcome GPA , credit attempt , credit earn , standardized test score , crime involvement . Researchers also access SAGA 's programmatic data tutor characteristic , include demographic information information math teacher training , assess variation effectiveness tutor examine degree tutor characteristic correspond different student outcome . Researchers believe propose project provide valuable insight scale may turn extremely cost-effective way improve educational outcome low-income youth . But perhaps importantly , hope work contribute broad understanding program scale affect program quality systematically study relationship . The investigator hope project create `` roadmap '' grow body research science scale-up , guide effort future researcher understand implication scale intervention scarce input .</detailed_description>
