	<detailed_description>The myofascial shoulder pain cause myofascial trigger point , one main cause medical consultation functional disability general population particularly amateur athlete . Nowadays , many physiotherapist world , study practice dry needle therapeutic tool treatment myofascial trigger point . The used modality technique describe Hong : - This technique introduce acupuncture needle skin reach dysfunctional muscle fiber . To , use maneuver `` fast '' `` fast '' needle , extinction local twitch response tolerance patient . - The local twitch response define reflex transitory contraction group muscle fiber associate myofascial trigger point . - The technique eliminate muscle contractile activity mechanical interruption muscle fiber , mechanism finish sensitization nearby nerve start nociceptive modulation peripheral , segmental central . The dry needling technique , eagerness obtain local twitch response , pierce muscle fiber dysfunctional normal , fascial tissue wrap myofascial trigger point also neuro-vascular structure . That , treatment myofascial trigger point dry needling , make reference mechanical trauma do acupuncture needle . The myofascial tissue injure suffer repair regeneration , mainly due extension lesion . The process heal wound strictly regulate multiple growth factor cytokine , release wound . The alteration disturb heal process , lead chronic wound heal excessive fibrosis . The pathobiological process , form fibrosis , would present change stiffness elasticity neo-tissue . The quantitative elastography , show effective tool measure amount fibrosis , occasion repeat percussion acupuncture needle myofascial tissue .</detailed_description>
