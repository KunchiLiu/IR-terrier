	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating Go NAP SACC 's Web-based Nutrition Tool Child Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>National data show many child , even young 2-5 year old , adopt unhealthy eating pattern overweight/obese . Interventions target early childhood critical reversing trend . More half 3-6 year old US enrol center-based child care program , spend 25 hour per week . For child , center 's nutrition environment influence develop preference habit thereby , weight status . The Nutrition Physical Activity Self-Assessment Child Care ( NAP SACC ) develop 2002 help child care provider improve food physical activity environment . Evaluations NAP SACC show efficacious , program 's reliance train technical assistance professional in-person delivery limit potential large-scale dissemination , especially low-resourced rural area . Go NAP SACC develop overcome challenge provide tailor web-based tool resource allow child care provider complete program . This study evaluate Go NAP SACC determine web-based delivery broaden dissemination program , particularly low-resourced rural area . This project use randomize controlled design evaluate impact Go NAP SACC center ' nutrition environment . A sample 40 child care center recruit take part . Participating center randomize ( 1:1 ) one two arm : immediate access ( intervention ) delay access ( control ) . Measures collect two time point , baseline post-intervention ( 4 month later ) , assess change center ' nutrition environment score . The sample 40 licensed center recruit rural county North Carolina . To facilitate recruitment , county-level Smart Start partnership ( local organization exist relationship child care program ) ask share information study local center compile list might interested participate . Then , train research assistant follow-up interested center telephone confirm interest eligibility . To eligible , center must serve 3-5 year old child 2 preschool teacher willing take part measure along center director , quality rating 2-5 star ( exempt rating ) , participate NAP SACC last 6 month . Centers director complete memorandum understand informed consent ; teacher give informational fact sheet ( ask sign consent ) . Centers randomize follow completion baseline measure . Those randomize intervention arm give immediate access Go NAP SACC online tool . To facilitate use , technical assistance provider local Smart Start partnership provide in-person orientation center director help register , learn navigate website , review timeline implementation . Center director 4 month complete self-assessment , select goal work , create action plan , implement plan use resource tips material library . Technical assistance staff provide brief monthly check-in ( telephone email ) prompt continue effort . Centers randomize control group receive access support 4-6 month later ( post-intervention measure complete ) . To evaluate impact Go NAP SACC , center ' nutrition environment assess two timepoints : baseline post-intervention . These assessment use self-report version Environment Policy Assessment Observation ( EPAO-SR ) , use self-administered survey complete director preschool teacher . The EPAO-SR modify focus solely nutrition environment ( eliminate physical activity screen time item ) . The statistical analysis compare difference mean change center ' nutrition environment score pre- post-intervention intervention control group . The analysis ass change overall nutrition environment score , well change seven environmental sub-components . Analyses involve test hypothesis intent-to-treat ( ITT ) principle use SAS v.9.2 Generalized Linear Modeling ( PROC GLM ) . Use PROC GLM , instead simple t-test , allow u control key characteristic ( e.g. , technical assistance staff , quality star rating , participation Child Adult Care Food Program ) . To explore effect intervention , investigator fit Generalized Linear Mixed Models : 1 ) adjust baseline variable distribute differently intervention comparison group ; 2 ) test interaction term treatment group covariates ; 3 ) examine completers . NOTE DEVIATION : While anticipate sample 40 child care center , 33 enrol , 31 provide sufficient baseline follow-up data include analysis .</detailed_description>
