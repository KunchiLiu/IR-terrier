	<brief_summary>Leg ulcer define wound last month . They would receive 0.2 % population Western country . In Europe , cost per episode leg ulcer estimate 6650 euro ( 10 000 euros foot ulcer ) . The cost treatment wound would 2 4 % health budget . Infection common complication chronic wound : case , result delay healing , , result amputation serious general complication Bacterial contamination ulcer constant . Over time 25 year , various study show relatively identical result . The bacteria present 90 % etiology venous leg ulcer . These bacteria divide four common class : Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus , Streptococcus , Pseudomonas . The bacterial ecology change time . Indeed Staphylococcus aureus appear first , Pseudomonas associate ulcer last several month . Anaerobic difficult find , find 30 % case Cohabitation leg ulcer bacteria often without clinical consequence : These stage infection colonization . The infection relate proliferation bacteria invasion skin , increase virulence ( virulence gene acquisition ) . The increase number bacteria multiplicity bacterial genus one reason increase virulence bacteria . When bacteria proliferate , host defense inadequate , vascular disease promote proliferation , clinical sign appear</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROJECT Vascular medicine St Joseph , management chronic wound concern 80 % hospitalized patient , 1,000 patient per year . The reason hospitalization patient outside revascularization gesture , often perform skin graft . The existence infection ulcer arrival service cons-indication transplant , delay sign infection bring control . This scenario common . The Medical Information department six month , note 100 patient cod `` leg ulcer '' principal diagnosis `` soft tissue infection '' secondary diagnosis . The importance recruitment lack recommendation management patient justify completion clinical microbiological work Until recent month , request Microbiology , bacteriological refer biopsy perform first line suspect infected ulcer . After read literature , invasive nature gesture , evaluation biopsy compare swab large patient population seem necessary investigator The propose work randomize blind microbiological observational part clinical part , prospective series consecutive carrier infect leg ulcer patient , regardless etiology leg ulcer , exclude dermohypodermitis complicate acute bacterial leg ulcer , several objective : PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Demonstrate non-inferiority swab compare biopsy management patient hospitalize infected leg ulcer two situation 1 . If graft Primary endpoint : time day begin hospitalization day transplant perform . Indeed , transplant perform doctor determines infection control 2 . If patient graft : Primary endpoint : time begin hospitalization end ideal hospitalization ( clinician believe patient get ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES CRITERIA heal rate patient 1 month , 3 month 6 month bacteriological agreement : swab biopsy Comparing interest biopsy compare swab : percentage patient unblinding necessary biopsy informative swab ( different bacteria require special treatment ) . levy failure rate sample sterile ulcer infect clinically . The collection demographic , etiological , nutritional profile , collection various local sign provide indicator response propose strategy . This type study never do population leg ulcer .</detailed_description>
