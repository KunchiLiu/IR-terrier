	<brief_title>Underwater Resection Non-pedunculated Colorectal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional endoscopic resection small large ( ≥1cm ) colorectal lesion well establish perform colon fully distend gas . Conventional polypectomy effective , rate incomplete resection approximately 10 % . Incomplete eradication precancerous lesion contributes interval colorectal cancer ; therefore , alternative technique resection safely effectively increase rate complete resection important . Underwater resection ( UR ) benign colorectal lesion novel technique utilizes advantage water aid endoscopic method may decrease incomplete resection rate small large non-pedunculated lesion . The investigator propose hypothesis small ( 6-9mm ) large ( ≥1cm ) non-pedunculated neoplastic colorectal lesion resect UR ( partially distend , water fill lumen without submucosal fluid injection ) , significantly decrease incomplete resection rate ( IRR ) compare conventional polypectomy perform gas distend lumen . Small ( 6-9mm ) large ( ≥1cm ) non-pedunculated benign neoplastic colorectal lesion identify screen , surveillance , diagnostic therapeutic colonoscopy randomize conventional polypectomy ( gas distend lumen without submucosal fluid injection ) versus UR ( partially distend , water fill lumen without submucosal injection ) patient level . Small ( 6-9mm ) lesion remove 9mm firm , thin wire cold snare large ( ≥1cm ) lesion remove snare electrocautery . Efforts remove lesion en bloc small rim normal mucosa make , although large lesion ( ≥2cm ) may require piecemeal resection . Submucosal fluid injection solution may use conventional technique large and/or flat lesion . Post-polypectomy incomplete resection rate assess 4 quadrant biopsy obtain around resection site immediately post-resection .</detailed_description>
