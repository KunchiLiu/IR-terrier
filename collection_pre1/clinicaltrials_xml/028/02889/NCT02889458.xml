	<brief_summary>Introduction : With population age increase Westernization breast cancer continue important health condition among woman Hong Kong . Greater collaborative research effort need examine question population screen breast cancer , aetiology lesion outcomes breast cancer survivorship period . There lack locally-relevant model assess breast cancer risk . Contribution novel genetic factor breast cancer , identification key functional allele gene region associate risk breast cancer well gene-environment interaction , require investigation Chinese population . Prognostic research study West may readily applicable Chinese population . Objectives : We aim investigate aetiology outcome breast cancer local Chinese use case-control cohort study design health care set Hong Kong . We aim examine potential risk factors/biomarkers ( traditional novel ) , build infrastructure biobank breast cancer surveillance . We follow case prospectively survivor cohort . Methods : A hospital-based case-control study prospective survivor cohort study conduct . Consecutive incident breast cancer DCIS case ( n=3,500 ) within 24-month period Hong Kong recruit public hospital , private hospital private practice ; control select frequency-matching factor age hospital/clinic setting . Cases prospectively followed 2-year period , data collection occur baseline ( within 24 week diagnosis ) , 6 month , 1 2 year follow baseline assessment . Biologic sample ( include blood , tumour normal breast tissue sample case , blood sample control ) collect later genetic molecular study include WGS , GWAS , gene-environment interaction molecular functional study . Depending availability pathology sample resource , additional study tissue microarray block production consider performed future . Data analyse traditional regression , EWAS genetic association method , whenever relevant . Public Health Implications : The repository clinical , radiological biological material assemble case-control study serve common , publicly accessible platform subsequent functional analysis scientific interrogation . The case-control finding would offer improved understanding state science aetiology breast cancer Chinese woman . In genomics analysis , potential refine classification breast tumour may enhance understanding , detection follow-up lesion , well enable u inform targeted personalized treatment selection woman population . The cohort study finding important develop effective strategy improvement overall survival quality life cancer survivor Chinese population .</brief_summary>
