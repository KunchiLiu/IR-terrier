	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor oral , reversibly-binding , direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist use clinically prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Guideline recommendation use dual antiplatelet therapy formulate ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin preference clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin ACS patient . However , East Asian patient include trial ass use drug . In addition , grow body data support East Asian might different adverse event profile ( thrombophilia bleed ) `` therapeutic window '' compare white subject . In Korea Japan , recently report low dos ticagrelor might potent inhibition platelet aggregation clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) healthy subject patient stable coronary artery disease , respectively . But still clear whether low dose ticagrelor superior clopidogrel diabetic patient stable coronary disease . A recent study pharmacokinetics tolerability ticagrelor find maximum plasma concentration area plasma concentration-time curve ticagrelor ( 90 mg twice daily ) active metabolite ( AR-C124910XX ) tend approximately 40 % high healthy Chinese volunteer compare Caucasian subject . This data also suggest low dose ticagrelor might appropriate Chinese patient coronary heart disease . In view large diurnal variation single daily dose , low dose twice daily may better choice Chinese patient . Recent study find antiplatelet drug might anti-inflammatory effect protect endothelial function . ACS patient treat ticagrelor significantly high increase level circulate progenitor cell compare treated clopidogrel , suggest benefit endothelial regeneration may participate pleiotropic property drug . This may prompt regression blood vessel endothelium stability . But clear effect low-dose ticagrelor vascular endothelial function diabetic patient stable coronary artery disease . Therefore , investigator perform randomize , single-blind clinical trial observe effect different dos ticagrelor standard-dose clopidogrel platelet aggregation endothelial function diabetic patient stable coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
