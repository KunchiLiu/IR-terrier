	<brief_summary>Objective : To document sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) muscle fibrosis congenital muscular torticollis ( CMT ) infant quantified echotexture measure thickness treatment course . Design : Cohort study . Setting : Rehabilitation department tertiary care hospital . Participants : Infants clinical diagnosis CMT , without neurological presentation , cervical spin abnormality , developmental dysplastic hip problem , recruit study . Intervention : All subject physiotherapy least 3 month . They undergo least two time clinical assessment ultrasonographic examination ( 1 ) bilateral SCM muscle follow-up period . End follow-up : Subjects still prominent clinical presentation physiotherapy 6 month old 1 year would receive surgery . Subsided present clinical feature determine clinician end-point investigation . Main Outcome Measures : The K value , derive difference echo intensity ( 2 ) involve uninvolved SCM muscle longitudinal sonogram , use represent severity muscle fibrosis CMT infant . Bilateral SCM muscle thickness involved-to-uninvolved thickness ratio ( Ratio I/U ) also obtain longitudinal sonogram . Clinical outcome also record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . An experienced sonographer perform ultrasonographic examination subject supine position head rotate contralaterally examination side . A 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer use observe longitudinal transverse view bilateral SCM muscle subject . The ultrasound system setting , include gain ( 86 % ) , monitor dynamic range ( 70 dB ) , depth ( 2 cm ) , keep constant throughout study . 2 . The echo intensity determine computer-assisted gray scale analysis calculate MATLAB 2006b . The mean echo intensity every pixel region interest K value develop compare sonograms different individual different time subject estimate previous study ( PMID : 22215768 )</detailed_description>
