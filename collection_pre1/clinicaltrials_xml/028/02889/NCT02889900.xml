	<brief_summary>This open label , single arm , multi-center study assess efficacy safety combination cediranib olaparib tablet platinum-resistant relapsed high grade serous , high grade endometroid clear cell ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma patient receive least 3 prior line chemotherapy carry deleterious suspect deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Cediranib Combination With Olaparib Patients With Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study recruit approximately 100 patient age ≥18 year , histologically proven diagnosis platinum-resistant relapse high grade serous , high grade endometroid clear cell ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma receive least 3 prior line chemotherapy , carry deleterious suspect deleterious germline BRCA mutation . All patient recurrent platinum resistant disease . All patient receive prior antiangiogenic treatment e.g . bevacizumab , either first line recurrent set . To eligible enter study , patient measurable disease ( assessed Investigator ) There maximum duration take study treatment ( cediranib+olaparib ) . Patients continue study treatment objective radiological disease progression , define RECIST version 1.1 guideline , meet discontinuation criterion . Following discontinuation study treatment patient follow disease progression ( already progress ) , survival post-progression anti cancer therapy data cut-off final OS analysis , approximately 12 month enrolment last patient .</detailed_description>
