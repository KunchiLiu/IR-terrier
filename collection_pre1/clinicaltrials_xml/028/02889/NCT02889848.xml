	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate safety tolerability single injection collagenase enzyme directly uterine fibroid subject already select hysterectomy . Fibroids contain excessive amount collagen possible digestion collagen may beneficial reduce pain bleeding associate fibroid . Three subject inject saline evaluate safety effectiveness injection method . Additional subject inject increase dos study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Collagenase enzyme break collagen show efficacy clinical trial number diseases accumulation collagen . It possible lysis collagen may reduce collagen content fibroid thus decrease size fibroid , possibly reduce stiffness fibroid . This may result reduce symptom pain bleed associate fibroid . In study three subject inject saline follow immediately hysterectomy order evaluate safety effectiveness injection method . Twelve subject receive single injection study drug follow : three subject receive set dose collagenase enzyme follow hysterectomy 24-96 hour later ( Group 1 ) evaluate safety injection study drug . Nine subject receive increase dos collagenase enzyme follow hysterectomy 60-90 day later ( Group 2 ) .</detailed_description>
