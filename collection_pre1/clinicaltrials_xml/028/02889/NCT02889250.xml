	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Relieve Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late-life treatment resistant depression ( LL-TRD ) public health clinical dilemma . Older patient TRD : 1 ) great risk morbidity medication ECT , 2 ) likely require maintenance ECT ( carry risk cognitive impairment repeat exposure general anesthesia ) , compare young depressed patient . There great need develop target safe treatment LLTRD . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) neurosurgical intervention potential become treatment option appropriately select patient LL-TRD . To date , subcallosal cingulate white matter ( SCCWM ) DBS target clinical , safety , neurophysiologic data support therapeutic efficacy . The SCC consider `` governor '' network implicate process negative emotion symptom depression . Furthermore , structural functional impairment SCC connect network structure associate LLD , support potential target DBS old adult . The overarch aim project develop DBS SCCWM LL-TRD use experimental medicine approach investigator program device base 1 ) neurophysiologic measure target engagement 2 ) safety ( defined lack neuropsychiatric worsen stable neurocognition ) . The propose biomarker target engagement theta cordance ( TC ) , composite absolute relative theta power strongly correlate regional neural metabolism . The hypothesis TC increase DBS base observation increase frontal TC DBS combination PET data , show increased metabolism frontal cortical structure responder DBS . The investigator use magnetoencephalography measure TC DBS adjust stimulation setting optimize target engagement course study , response observe increase TC . Adding novelty project use personalize tractography guide precise electrode placement area SCCWM contain white matter tract mood-relevant frontal subcortical nucleus . During two year open-label project investigator implant 6 patient . For subject , course 6 month , investigator ascertain dose range effect escalate DBS stimulation parameter TC measure safety .</detailed_description>
