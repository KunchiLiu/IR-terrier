	<brief_title>Progressive Mobility Program Technology Improve Level Physical Activity Functionality ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evolution treatment Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) increase survival morbidity post hospital . Functional disability patient main factor weakness loss muscle mass , major complication report patient . The negative result long-term post ICU impact quality life functional decline due muscle disorder fitness . This achieved period inactivity prolong rest , lead loss change various body system . Given fact , intervention great mobility bed important . Early mobility program prove beneficial , however , type rehabilitation , exercise prescribe specific characteristic , include intensity . However , little described research abut activity level ICU , use quantitative measure . The use technology seem facilitate offering type therapy , supply limitation . Therefore , little evidence topic randomize controlled study investigate factor .</detailed_description>
