	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) relate reduced pulmonary function . As experimental study glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) show increase pulmonary surfactant secretion , GLP-1 receptor find significant amount lung , could hypothesize treatment liraglutide ( GL-1 agonist ) improve reduce pulmonary function</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Liraglutide Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow evidence suggest association type 2 diabetes impaired pulmonary function . In regard , several cross-sectional study appear show decreased index force expiration , lung volume diffusion capacity main lung dysfunction detect type 2 diabetic population . In fact , diabetes frequently co-morbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , data Atherosclerosis Risk Communities Study show faster pulmonary function decline type 2 diabetic patient participant . This important reduction FEV1 demonstrate independent cause mortality diabetic patient . Interestingly , lung function measure start decrease several year diagnosis diabetes . In regard investigation find insulin resistance independent determinant pulmonary function non-diabetic morbidly obese woman . In addition , result suggest metabolic pathway relate insulin resistance crucial initiating lung abnormality type 2 diabetic patient . The reason association respiratory disease diabetes unclear . However , relationship type 2 diabetes muscle strength , impairment lung elastic property , presence low-grade chronic inflammation state involve . In support finding , thicken alveolar epithelium pulmonary capillary basal lamina , fibrosis , centrilobular emphysema , pulmonary microangiopathy detect autopsy diabetic patient . In addition , defect bronchiolar surfactant layer , involve maintain airway stability diameter , may also consider contribute factor impairment airway calibre regulation diabetic patient . When alveolocapillary barrier damage , surfactant protein leak bloodstream . A recent population-based random sample study describe increase circulating level surfactant protein A , major surfactant-associated protein , associate alter glucose tolerance insulin resistance . Therefore , surfactant defect diabetic individual may also lead increase airway resistance reduction ventilatory pattern observe study . In addition , experimental study show glucagon-like peptide 1 play role stimulation surfactant production , underlie deficit type 2 diabetes could also enhance airway resistance observe patient . However , beneficial effect pulmonary function use incretin-based therapy remain elucidated . Clinical trial study hypothesis treatment incretin mimetic liraglutide may ameliorate lung function parameter type 2 diabetic patient , independently weight reduction . This hypothesis base follow factor : 1 . - There grow evidence suggest association type 2 diabetes impaired pulmonary function . 2 . - In patient type 2 diabetes , incretin effect severely reduce absent , contribute reduce lung function parameter observe type 2 diabetic patient . 3 . - GLP-1 stimulates surfactant production `` vitro '' study , consequence , increase surfactant production induce liraglutide could main factor involved respiratory improvement .</detailed_description>
