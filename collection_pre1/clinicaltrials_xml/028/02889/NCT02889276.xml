	<brief_summary>This study first examine effect functional resistance exercise programme closely replicate daily activity effect quality life , body composition functional fitness cancer survivor . This study also use supervise group base exercise set help socialisation confidence aim improve exercise experience . Eligible participant 18-90 year old , treated colorectal cancer ( stag I-IV ) previous 3 month five year limitation exercise . The study include 12-week exercise period participant randomly allocate control group take part 32 supervise one-hour group exercise session involve exercise target whole body moderate intensity take place Mountbatten Centre , Pyramids Centre , Fareham Leisure Centre Horizons Leisure Centres . Depending participant ' membership status control group could use centre 's exercise referral programme , cost attach , encourage meet national physical activity recommendation walk 30 minute per day day week . The difference two group supervise group functional resistance training . At begin end 12-week study period number health-related fitness test perform assess health outcome , rest blood pressure &amp; heart rate , respiratory function , body fat measure ( body mass index , waist circumference body fat % ) , functional performance measurement , handgrip strength , 6 minute walk test self-efficacy regulate exercise measure quality life questionnaire . Participants provide result overview whole study data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential volunteer identify clinical care team ask contact research team interest participate . The participant randomly allocate either control group exercise group participate study . The control group ask perform 150 minute moderate activity week , 30 minute brisk walk 5 day week . The exercise group ask participate FRT exercise session 12-weeks . The exercise session perform frequency 2 time week ( week 1-4 ) three time week ( week 5-12 ) . The exercise programme include 10 muscle-strengthening exercise 5 recovery exercise ( example walk one minute ) . All exercise perform circuit fashion circuit perform 1 time ( week 1-2 ) , 2 time ( week 3-6 ) finally 3 time last six week study ( week 7-12 ) . During main part workout participant perform 10 repetition moderate vigorous intensity ( week 1-12 ) resistance exercise alternate every two resistance exercise one active recovery exercise ( e.g . walk ) . They continue pattern complete circuit . Each circuit last approximately 15 minute ( 1 minute 10 resistance exercise station 1 minute 5 active recovery station ) Both participation study , researcher take anthropometric ( body weight , height , waist hip circumference , body fat % lean body mass ) measurements participant perform four physical fitness test ( 6 minute walk test , hand grip strength , lift carry test , chair stand test ) order assess effect exercise physical fitness answer quality life questionnaire . At least 12 hour important abstain participate strenuous physical activity alcohol/caffeine consumption . In addition , last meal consume 4 hour test . In addition , give physical activity diary 12-week study period record daily activity . Participants exercise group also receive weight-training diary , record progress FRT station ( i.e . increase resistance load FRT exercise ) .</detailed_description>
