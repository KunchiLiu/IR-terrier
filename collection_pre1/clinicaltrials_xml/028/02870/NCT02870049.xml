	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen save life , screen rate low among underserved population , particularly Latinos . The screen rate predominantly Latino population serve San Ysidro Health Center ( SYHC , Federally Qualified Health Center ( FQHC ) ) , 31 % , similar report Latinos nationally , low overall national average 65 % . Previous research demonstrate inreach intervention point medical care patient navigation screen referral , outreach outside usual medical care ( mailed invitation ) increase screen rate among underserved population . However , since undergone limited evaluation among low income predominantly Spanish-speaking Latinos , unclear approach best , whether implement approach would synergistic optimize screen rate . We hypothesize two culturally linguistically tailored intervention : ) inreach strategy ( IR , consist community health worker-delivered clinic education regard CRC screen component ) , b ) outreach strategy ( OS , consist mailed invitation complete screen enclosed fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) telephone reminder ) substantially increase screening , , two intervention together substantially good either alone . To test hypothesis , propose randomize trial compare usual care , IR , OS , IR+OS CRC screening .</detailed_description>
