	<detailed_description>This research aim test impact novel preemptive home-delivery intervention aim increase use oral rehydration salt ( ORS ) zinc child diarrhea Uganda . The intervention aim increase availability ORS zinc reduce barrier access community health worker ( CHWs ) deliver product directly household free prior diarrhea episode . Under set-up , product readily available free immediately child come diarrhea . Moreover , investigator disentangle mechanism intervention could change product use use multi-armed approach test impact free distribution preemptive home-delivery separately ( i.e . preemptive delivery free free preemptive delivery ) . The investigator use four-arm cluster randomize control trial design measure impact three intervention ORS zinc use treat child diarrhea relative control group . The investigator enroll 120 CHWs ( locate different village ) randomly assign 1 4 group : Group 1 — Control : No intervention take place . Caretakers standard access ORS zinc local health facility pharmacy . Some CHWs control village could make household visit , however offer sell diarrhea treatment preemptively rare CHWs generally source diarrhea treatment . Group 2 — Household Visit + Free Distribution + Preemptive Delivery : CHWs provide small incentive visit household catchment area contain child 5-years-old ( roughly 100 household ) begin study . CHWs train caretaker danger diarrhea importance ORS zinc use . CHWs offer give ORS zinc caretaker free store home . Group 3 — Household Visit + Cost Sharing + Preemptive Delivery : CHWs provide small incentive visit household catchment area contain child 5-years-old beginning study . CHWs train caretaker danger diarrhea importance ORS zinc use . CHWs offer sell ORS zinc caretaker standard subsidize price ( roughly USD $ 0.40 total per treatment course ) store home . Group 4 - Household Visit + Free Distribution Upon Retrieval : CHWs provide small incentive visit household catchment area contain child 5-years-old beginning study . CHWs train caretaker danger diarrhea importance ORS zinc use . CHWs inform caretaker ORS zinc available free caretaker retrieve CHWs home need . The average distance CHWs household 15 minute . Groups 2-4 compare Group 1 measure impact different way arrange program . Group 3 compare Group 2 measure price effect . Group 4 compare Group 2 measure distance/convenience effect .
