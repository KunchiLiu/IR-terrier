	<brief_title>Performance Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests Detection NG CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Significance : Infections due Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( NG ) Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) major threat public health . In 2008 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 100 million new worldwide case NG CT . In 2013 , 333,000 NG 1.4 million CT genitourinary infection US . Most CT NG infection asymptomatic , infection lead serious sequela , include infertility , chronic pelvic pain , adverse obstetrical outcome , increase risk acquire human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , disseminate infection . There also grow concern antibiotic resistance . In 2013 , US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) classify drug-resistant NG one three urgent-level resistant bacteria . Improved detection extragenital NG think crucial component adequate treatment prevention resistance . Currently , CDC recommend use NAATs screen diagnose NG CT genitourinary tract due superior sensitivity compare traditional culture method . The sensitivity specificity commercially available NAATs detection urogenital NG CT estimate 90-100 % . The CDC also recommend use NAATs screen diagnosis NG CT extragenital site . Due widespread use interest test extragenital NG CT infection , multiple study examine test characteristic NAAT test comparison culture additional NAAT platform . For diagnosis CT , report sensitivity 80-100 % ( pharyngeal ) 46-100 % ( rectal ) , significant variation platform test . Reported specificity &gt; 99 % pharyngeal site 89-100 % rectum . For diagnosis NG , report sensitivity 72-100 % ( pharyngeal ) 75-100 % ( rectal ) , variation platform . Reported specificity 72-100 % ( pharyngeal ) 95-100 % ( rectal ) . Despite CDC 's recommendation , however , currently FDA-approved commercial NAAT test detection pharyngeal rectal NG CT infection . The FDA 's clearance assay would increase ability diagnose control NG CT extragenital infection . This research study help provide data require FDA consideration clear assay marketing . Design &amp; Procedures : This cross-sectional , single visit study evaluate performance three commercial NAATs detect NG CT rectum pharynx . A fourth NAAT use tiebreaker . The performance fourth NAAT evaluate . Each manufacturer provide specific collection kit transport medium . This research study take place healthcare clinic focus sexually transmit disease , woman 's health , student health , family planning clinic , clinic specialize lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender ( LGBT ) health . This research include specimen collect 2,500 adult male , female , transgender person seek sexually transmit disease ( STD ) test participate study clinic . Both symptomatic asymptomatic subject include study population . Potential subject identify , assessed eligibility , ask provide oral inform consent . If agree take part research , study subject eight swab collect : four pharyngeal four rectal . The swab need routine clinical care take first . All study procedure take place one clinic visit . There follow-up visit part study . Subjects continue routine clinical care direct medical provider . Subject participation confidential anonymous . The result test subject participant research place subject ' medical record . Each study swab use specific NAAT , run one two reference test laboratory . The Anatomic Site Infection Status ( ASIS ) define result two NAATs , , necessary , tiebreaker test . Each anatomic site consider isolation . If few four swab site complete , anatomic site ( swab result ) exclude analysis .</detailed_description>
