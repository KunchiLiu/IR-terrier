	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , open-label trial evaluate safety pharmacokinetics weekly intravenous infusion 60 mg/kg investigational drug subject AATD . The trial conduct approximately 5 medical institution Japan , aim enroll minimum 3 adult subject . The trial consist screen period schedule within 3 week trial entry , open-label treatment period 8 week , PK evaluation period 1 week . At Week 9 visit PK evaluation period complete , subject ask whether would like participate extension trial ( GTI1401-OLE ) . For subject intend participate extension trial , date follow-up/study completion visit ( 30 day [ 4 week ] last dose investigational drug ) arrange . Subjects participate trial approximately 14 week start screen period completion trial . At screen visit ( schedule within 3 week trial entry ) , provide inform consent ( agreement base adequate explanation understand treatment plan ) , subject evaluate eligibility participation screen period . Subjects consider eligible enter 8-week treatment period receive total 8 weekly intravenous infusion 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP . The initial intravenous infusion give Week 1 ( baseline ) visit . During treatment period , subject receive weekly intravenous infusion Alpha-1 MP Weeks 1 ( baseline ) , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 visit . After last intravenous infusion Alpha-1 MP Week 8 visit , subject enter 1-week PK evaluation period . During PK evaluation period , subject visit study center undergo blood sample PK evaluation PK1 visit ( next day Week 8 visit ) , PK2 visit ( 2 day Week 8 visit ) , PK5 visit ( 5 day Week 8 visit ) , Week 9 visit . At 30 day last dose ( Week 8 ) , subject visit study center follow-up/study completion ( Week 12 ) . All subject undergo blood sample measurement alpha1-PI trough concentration Weeks 1 ( baseline ) , 7 , 8 visit ( blood sample collect dose ) well Week 9 visit . Blood sample evaluation PK parameter collect Week 8 Week 9 . The blood sample collect infusion Alpha-1 MP Week 8 visit blood sample PK evaluation collect Week 9 visit ( 7 day infusion Week 8 visit ) also use measurement alpha1-PI trough concentration Weeks 8 9 . At Week 9 visit , subject ask whether would like participate extension trial ( GTI1401-OLE ) . Subjects intend participate extension trial able continue treatment intravenous infusion 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP least another year ( subject ask whether would like continue treatment yearly interval ) purpose evaluation safety long-term Alpha-1 MP treatment . Subjects intend enter extension trial visit study center follow-up/study completion 30 day ( 4 week ) last dose Alpha-1 MP ( Week 12 ) .</detailed_description>
