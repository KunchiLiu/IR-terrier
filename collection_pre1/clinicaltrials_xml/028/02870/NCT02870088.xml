	<brief_title>The Effect Breaking Prolonged Sitting Adipose Tissue Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-trial assessment : Physical activity assessment : combined heart rate/accelerometer monitor wear 7 day assess participant 's habitual physical activity energy expenditure ( Actiheart , Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd. , Cambridge , UK ) . This attached leave chest via 2 adhesive ECG pad 24 hour per day except showering/bathing/swimming . Body composition analysis : Body mass assess use digital scale post-void ( TANITA corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) . Waist hip circumference assess base World Health Organisation guideline . Body composition determine use Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( Discovery , Hologic , Bedford , UK ) . Abdominal subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue mass estimate central region L1-L4 . Trial day : In 72 h prior main trial , participant ask refrain perform strenuous physical activity . In 48 h prior main trial , consume alcohol/caffeine allow meantime , dietary record complete 48 h first main trial . Participants ask replicate diet prior second main trial . In addition , 48 h prior main trial , participant ask restrict step 4000 step per day order mimic sedentary lifestyle pattern eliminate acute effect recent physical activity . Two trial perform include one prolong sit one break prolonged sit trial . In break trial , consume 1st meal , participant walk 2 min treadmill 6.4 km/h speed every 20 minute follow 180 min . For remainder time participant sit chair . After 180 min , 2nd meal provide . After finish 2nd meal , participant continue 2 min break prolonged sit physical activity speed every 20 min follow 120 min . In total , participant perform 15 two minute bout physical activity throughout trial total 30 min break prolonged sit physical activity . In prolonged sit trial , participant sit chair . Expired air , RPE heart rate collect two break sit walk determine exercise intensity energy expenditure . In addition , two 5 min sit expire air heart rate take calculated total energy expenditure sit . During trial , participant allow move sit position treadmill void require . While sit , participant allow read , use laptop watch television otherwise ask keep still possible throughout . In first trial , participant allow consume water ad libitum volume ingest replicate 2nd trial In main trial , baseline blood sample collect 1st meal hourly follow 5 hour . Additional blood sample collect every 15 min first second meal . A total 14 blood sample collect trial . Adipose tissue culture gene expression : After adipose tissue biopsy cleaning , tissue mince approximately 5-10 mg directly place sterile culture plate ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) endothelial cell basal medium ( ECBM ) contain 0.1 % fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin 100 U ml-1 penicillin 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Gillingham , UK ) . Adipose tissue incubate final ratio 100mg tissue per 1 ml ECBM medium 3 hour . A 37°C , 5 % CO2 95 ± 5 % relative humidity incubator use ( MCO-18A1C CO2 incubator ; Sanyo , Osaka , Japan ) . Media transfer sterile eppendorfs store −80°C 3 hour incubation . Approximately 200 mg adipose tissue homogenise 5ml Trizol RNase/DNase-free sterile tube ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) store −80°C analysis . Sample size : A previous similar study report incremental area curve ( iAUC ) insulin break prolong sit compare prolonged sitting 3337 IU L-1 9h-1 2470 IU L-1 9h-1 , respectively . Based assume SD 600 IU L-1 9h-1 , would require 9 participant show difference iAUC insulin 95 % power 5 % alpha . Statistics : All data present mean ± standard error mean ( SEM ) . Incremental area curve ( iAUC ) calculate use trapezoid method difference trial analyse use pair t-tests . Glucose , insulin , NEFA , adipokines , cell culture outcome determine use two-way ANOVA repeat measure use SPSS version 22 ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Where significant interaction ( trial × time ) find , post hoc analysis apply use t-test Holm-Bonferroni correction . Single comparison use t-test non-parametric equivalent . Statistical significance set p ≤ 0.05 .</detailed_description>
