	<brief_title>Prospective Studies Oral Health Quality Life Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Europe , 73 000 persons/year get cancer head neck region . The treatment oral cancer vary depend tumour site stage . Some subject undergo surgery , subject treat chemotherapy combination radiation case brachytherapy use . Radiation therapy lead markedly reduce salivary secretion rate , make difficult eat talk risk factor oral disorder caries mucosal infection . A reduced salivary secretion rate often life long side-effect treatment seriously affect quality life . To reduce side-effects patient get preventive supportive oral treatment connection cancer treatment . However , regardless radiation dos give , severity problem vary considerably . Therefore , well understand problem occur important identification subject risk find good measure treatment , suit individual need . Dentate subject refer Dr. Bodil Fagerberg-Mohlin , radiation therapy head neck region include . Data collect 5 occasion : treatment well 6 , 12 24 month complete radiation therapy . The subject ' cancer diagnosis , treatment , radiation dos , infection medication obtain medical record . Their odontological preventive treatment use agent fluoride saliva-stimulating chewing gum tablet register . Dietary habit register use questionnaire focus intake carbohydrate-rich food-items item contain sugar-substitutes . The subject ask fill often use item 6-grade scale . The subject weight register , radiation therapy . A clinical examination perform 6 , 12 24 month complete radiation therapy . Panoramic x-rays take well bitewing radiograph . The number teeth , caries status , oral hygiene register . Mucositis register radiation therapy . Secretion stimulate whole saliva determine radiation therapy . Minor labial buccal gland saliva secretion rate determine use Periotron-method . Centrifuged stimulate saliva minor gland saliva store freezer pending analysis IgA , albumin , mucins lactoferrin use ELISA-techniques . Microbial sample collect occasion tongue , buccal mucosa supragingival plaque . The total viable count register well microorganisms associate oral health ( streptococci , Neisseria ) , gingival inflammation ( Fusobacterium nucleatum , Prevotella ) , caries ( mutans streptococci , lactobacilli ) mucosal infection ( Candida , staphylococci , Gram-negative enteric rod enterococci ) . The sample analyse use cultivation technique . The quality life register use questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire ) , cancer-specific questionnaire evaluate health-related quality life cancer patient . The questionnaire consist five function scale , global quality life scale , three symptom scale six single item , total 30 question describe patient ' symptom functional level prior week . To address additional symptom associate specifically cancer head neck region treatment , complementary 35-item module , EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N35 use . Both questionnaire prove reliable valid . Calculated scale score range 0-100 . On function scale Global quality life scale , score 100 represent maximum functioning , whereas symptom scale single item , score 100 indicates worst possible symptom . For EORTC questionnaire , change score time &gt; 10 consider detect clinically significant difference . Hospital Anxiety Depression scale The patient also complete Hospital Anxiety Depression Scales , HADS , use measure severity anxiety depressive symptom provide estimate possible mood disorder patient somatic comorbidity . HADS valid reliable instrument . The HAD scale consist 14 item , seven item depression 7 item anxiety score range 0-21 . For factor , result interpret follow : 8-10 point indicate case possible anxiety depression &gt; 10 point indicate probable anxiety depression . Statistical analysis Changes baseline 6 month , 6 12 month 12 24 month make use paired sample test . For analysis change within cancer group , partial correlation use analyse association time ( correlation coefficient r &gt; 0.4 consider statistically significant ) . For quality life data , change score time &gt; 10 point could interpret clinically significant . For analysis association QoL oral status 6 , 12 24 month partial correlation use ( r &gt; 0.4 consider statistically significant ) .</detailed_description>
