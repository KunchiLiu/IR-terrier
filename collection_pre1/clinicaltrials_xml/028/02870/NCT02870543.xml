	<brief_title>Efficacy Phytolacca Decandra Melissa Officinalis Children With Nocturnal Bruxism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , crossover , placebo-controlled study child age 3 to12 year old nocturnal bruxism randomly allocate different phase study , accord treatment step : ( 1 ) placebo ; ( 2 ) Phytolacca decandra ; ( 3 ) Melissa officinalis ; ( 4 ) Phytolacca decandra associate Melissa officinalis . This study enrol Dental clinic Pediatric Dentistry department Dental School , Federal University Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) , September 2014 July 2017 . All child participate clinical stage , washout interval 14 day phase . Children principal investigator mask treatment . After anamnesis , extra intraoral clinical examination conduct begin study , single train calibrated examiner ( researcher responsible study ) . Thus , facial symmetry , temporomandibular joint masticatory muscle activity observe . For evaluation residual effect bruxism muscle ( masseter temporalis ) masticatory system , electromyography exam perform . For intra-oral clinical examination , patient position comfortably dental chair exam conduct aid artificial light dental reflector mirror plane , exploratory probe cotton tweezer . Data patient also record dental record previously train annotator . The presence clinical sign relate presence bruxism , presence dental enamel wear microfractures facet also evaluate . The Brazilian version ECOHIS ( B-ECOHIS ) use assess quality life select child 0-7 year old . This instrument apply phase study . And , Brazilian version `` Child Perceptions Questionnaire '' ( CPQ ) 8-10 11-14 , also use assess physical psychosocial impact nocturnal bruxism child adolescent study . The child 's anxiety observe mean rating scale trait anxiety child . This scale also apply phase study . All medicine , include placebo , place identical amber glass vial , label / encode ( A , B , C , D ) distribute ramdonly children/parents , accordance phase study . In every return , parent / guardian must give back bottle used period verify residual volume . Thus , intake medicine properly evaluate . The subject distribute within treatment phase study accordance follow medication : • Phase 1 - Placebo ; • Phase 2 - Use isolated Phytolacca decandra 12CH ; • Phase 3 - Use isolated Melissa officinalis 12CH ; • Phase 4 - Combined use Phytolacca decandra 12CH Melissa officinalis 12CH . Each drug , include placebo , formulate Homeopathy Pharmacy , Faculty Pharmacy , UFRJ . They administer period 30 day washout interval 14 day phase . All test solution pack amber glass 30 ml dropper prepare time laboratory condition . Supervision pharmaceutical manipulation technical responsibility least one homeopathic pharmaceutic . Administration test medicine ( solution ) make day , follow dosage : 01 drop solution per age individual . Patients caregiver must inform product involve oral care ( toothpastes mouthwash ) interfere absorption homeopathic medicine , 15-minute interval preserve drug intake self-care mouth individual . It emphasize use drug , quantity , time frequency inform write prescription . The parent and/ guardian responsible help monitoring efficacy treatment . At first visit , receive notebook serve sleep diary . This instrument use parent / guardian describe self-perception sleep routine child . In appointment parent / guardian receive researcher 's instruction completion daily diary . Thus , serve later child 's primary information start use medicine . This routine maintain throughout period treatment , rest phase ( wash ) , serve home mirror , reflect effect present child study period . The frequency nocturnal bruxism assess use Visual Analogue Scale . This scale apply parent / guardian first appointment obtain frequency bruxism child baseline . Also , reapplied phase monitor clench grind teeth . A multiple logistic regression model apply investigate difference treatment .</detailed_description>
