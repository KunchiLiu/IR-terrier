	<detailed_description>The study randomization , multicentre , phase 3 study recruit 510 patient . Patients eligible participate histological cytological documentation adenocarcinoma colon rectum . They must receive locally currently approve standard therapy disease progression within 3 month last administration last standard therapy stop standard therapy unacceptable toxic effect . The available standard therapy include many follow licensed : fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan . All patient receive best supportive care , exclude investigational antitumour agent antineoplastic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy . Patients receive oral donafenib 300mg ( CM4307 ) day 1-21 4 week cycle disease progression , death , unacceptable toxic effects.The primary endpoint overall survival.The second endpoint progression-free survival .</detailed_description>
