	<brief_summary>The existence family factor genesis varicose vein certain , study address reliably instead genetic factor clinical molecular level . The investigator initiate original study identify one genetic abnormality predispose varicose disease , base combined approach genetic linkage exome sequencing . The clinical research phase essential prerequisite identification genetic mutation ; identify large affected family ensure extremely rigorous accurate phenotyping individual several generation . A first clinical work identify / phenotype 8 family genetically informative family suggest autosomal dominant inheritance . Linkage analysis suggest several candidate chromosomal region without allow identification gene . This project aim resume expand Family clinical investigation apply technique genome analysis point , include exome sequencing informative family identify gene mechanisms responsible disease improve prevention treatment varicose vein .</brief_summary>
