	<brief_summary>In clinical practice , carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common disease peripheral neuropathy usually happen female , mid-age population , overweight person , overuse hand work production . Some research claim might correlate anatomical characteristic longer anteroposterior diameter small cross section area wrist . Preliminary symptom often start sensory domain ( pain , tingling , paresthesia especially night awaken due symptom mention ) progress motor domain ( thenar muscle atrophy clumsiness ) leave untreated . Depending severity , patient 's willingness convenience , many option CTS . For whose symptom mild moderate , conservative therapy usually first choice , include physiotherapy , local injection night splint . Local steroid proven effective relieve symptom CTS shortly 3 month . However , effect decline gradually repetitive injection suggestive . The patient severe symptom comprise thenar muscle atrophy advise receive decompression surgery.the surgery alleviate illness high success rate 70 % . Unfortunately , still patient relapse undergo side effect , example , finger weakness . In recent year , acupuncture research focus CTS intervention outgrow promising . Whereas , still lack evidence stand therapeutic effect compare local steroid injection . This limit built-up suspect mechanism acupuncture intervention CTS . This preliminary , randomize single-blinded study start since 2016 last year . The investigator utilize ultrasound guide depth needle penetration prevents unnecessarily tissue injury artery dry needle injury . This procedure also guarantee needle lie directly upper surface median nerve . One group receive electrical stimulation another wo n't . The investigator use electromyography , cross-section area median nerve , visual analog scale , Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire , six-item scale , The disability arm , shoulder hand score Jamar grip dynamometer outcome measurement . The result gather two experimental group compare data control group whose participant receive local steroid injection first week . The participant 18 year old complain illness least 3 month without surgery local injection least 1 year . The investigator set strict exclusive criterion sample size estimation 70 .</brief_summary>
