	<brief_title>Inpatient Consultation High-Risk Chronically Ill Children Receiving Care Enhanced Medical Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Comprehensive care ( CC ) provide High-Risk Children 's Clinic ( HRCC ) The University Texas Health Science Center Houston ( UTHealth ) involve care acute chronic condition team ethnically diverse pediatrician nurse practitioner highly train experienced treat medically complex fragile child . This clinic serf novel medical home primary specialty service provide place visit . Acute problem present 4 pm see day occur weekend , Monday morning . All parent cell phone number directly reach 1 primary care clinician hour . Multiple measure use promote ensure high quality care daily check emergency department hospital log ensure prompt follow-up coordination care , weekly HRCC provider team meeting review care provide every ED visit hospitalization , high priority give minimize unnecessary ED visit hospitalization , relatively low patient-to-staff ratio great 100 ( allow longer clinic visit , telephone call e-mail , extensive quality improvement measure ) . Comprehensive care undoubtedly increase access high-quality healthcare high-risk disadvantaged child . The finding previous randomize trial comprehensive care vs. usual care give accelerate publication JAMA ( 2014 ) attract national attention best evidence date support medical home reduce either adverse outcome cost ( Mosquera et al. , 2014 ) . Comprehensive care result major benefit ( ED visit , hospital admission &amp; day , pediatric ICU admission &amp; day reduce 47-69 % ) save &gt; $ 10,000/child/year health system perspective . Indeed , improvement outcome reduction cost exceed previously report prior study medical home patient age condition ( Mosquera et al. , 2014 ; Homer et al. , 2008 ; Jackson et al. , 2013 ) . Despite demonstrated benefit , high-risk patient see High-Risk Children 's Clinic still experience high rate morbidity often require hospitalization treatment acute exacerbation underlie chronic condition . In 2015 , 100 HRCC patient experience total 175 admission Children 's Memorial Hermann Hospital ( CMHH ) mean length stay ( LOS ) 7.1 day . As result , pilot quality improvement ( QI ) trial conduct assess impact offer inpatient consultation ( IC ) CMHH optimize coordination integration inpatient outpatient care reduce total hospital day per child-year . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : HRCC patient require admission CMHH include pilot trial . HRCC patient ≥ 18 year age study initiation exclude pilot trial Do-Not-Resuscitate ( DNR ) order , unrepaired congenital heart disease , active cancer , mitochondrial disorder , see HRCC clinic solely compassionate care . Enrollment period : All eligible HRCC patient admit CMHH October 3 , 2016 October 2 , 2019 enrol pilot trial . Design : All eligible HRCC patient randomize prior study enrollment either usual inpatient care comprehensive care inpatient consultation utilize computer-generated algorithm variable block size . Patients stratify two group accord whether consider great median risk repeat hospitalization patient study . Baseline hospitalization risk ( high-risk high-risk ) determine clinic 's medical director base patient 's diagnosis clinical course . Treatment Groups : Usual Inpatient Care : Inpatient care CMHH provide hospital inpatient team ( resident , fellow , attend faculty physician ) usual occasional communication HRCC provider . This care modify study protocol . Comprehensive care Inpatient Consultation : Inpatient care CMHH include inpatient consultation HRCC provider input recommendation convey hospital inpatient team admission discharge minimum . The HRCC provider review inpatient care plan make treatment discharge recommendation focus coordination integration inpatient outpatient care . The inpatient consultation consist either face-to-face consultation , non-face-to-face consultation , phone call inpatient physician team . Data Collection Management : Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) software utilized collect manage predefined study variable data . REDCap secure , web-based application design support electronic data capture research study provide : 1 ) intuitive interface validate data entry ; 2 ) audit trail track data manipulation export procedure ; 3 ) automate export procedure seamless data downloads common statistical package ; 4 ) procedure import data external source . Cost Assessment : Total hospital cost CMHH admission ER visit re-admission within 30 day CMHH discharge assess health system perspective multiplying total hospital charge department-specific cost-to-charge ratio specify hospital 's annual Medicare cost report . Hospital cost comprehensive care inpatient consultation group augment incremental HRCC personnel cost provide inpatient consultation base HRCC staff salary fringe data . All cost inflate year analysis base Consumer Price Index medical service . The investigator consider program highly cost-effective reduces total number hospital day per child-year without increase cost , reduces cost without increase total number hospital day per child-year , reduces . Statistical Economic Analyses : All intent-to-treat statistical economic analysis perform use multilevel generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) model exchangeable correlation account patient family clustering , robust standard error , log link . The economic analysis perform accord current standard analysis ( Drummond et al. , 2005 ; Gold et al. , 1996 ; Siegel et al. , 1996 ; Sanders et al. , 2016 ) . Differences hospital day cost treatment group assess use GEE model gamma distribution . Rates secondary outcome assess use binomial GEE model , whereas total number secondary outcome assess negative binomial GEE model . All model adjust trial 's stratifying variable ( baseline risk repeat hospitalization ) within-family correlation . In small pilot study , treatment effect would consider important family member clinician ( reduce hospital day ) may statistically significant . As result , Bayesian analysis also perform estimate probability benefit give magnitude evaluate whether study justify . Neutral skeptical prior use . The study also allow u obtain experience data need refine process provide inpatient consultation high-risk chronically ill child . All frequentist statistical analysis perform use Stata version 13.1 ( Stata Corp , College Station , TX ) . The Bayesian model implement use OpenBUGS . Stopping Rules . We plan enroll patient pilot trial 3 year . However , predefined stopping rule , enrollment cease Bayesian analyse performed end first year identifies 97.5 % great probability inpatient consultation result least 10 % reduction total number hospital day per child-year relative usual inpatient care end second year identifies 95 % great probability reduction .</detailed_description>
