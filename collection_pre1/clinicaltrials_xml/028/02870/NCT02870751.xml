	<brief_summary>Heat stable toxin ( ST ) produce ETEC strain important cause childhood diarrhea many country . Vaccine candidate target ST development . A human challenge model use epidemiologically relevant enterotoxigenic E.coli ( ETEC ) strain express ST , diarrhea induce toxin like heat labile toxin ( LT ) , necessary perform early efficient evaluation ST-toxoid base vaccine . In controlled human infection study investigator assess safety ST-only produce ETEC strain dose need achieve attack rate 70 % healthy human volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Challenge Model With ST-only Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate ST-only ETEC strain TW10722 volunteer previously , evaluate ETEC strain TW11681 , ETEC family 8 , serotype O19 : H45 , express STh , CFA/I , CS21 . This strain select good representative one important ETEC family commonly associate childhood ETEC diarrhea . After screen include routine blood sampling , intestinal lavage pre-challenge sample do . Volunteers admit three time Haukeland University Hospital isolate receive oral bacterial inoculum dos , start 10^6 increase one log per round safe dose elicits diarrhoea find . Fine adjustment dose need diarrhea attack rate 70 % do remain volunteer . Volunteers monitor range symptom , stool output adverse event . Antibiotic treatment administer certain predetermined severity diarrheal disease , 5 day eradicate ETEC infection volunteer leave hospital . Volunteers monitor sample day 10 , 28 365 infection . Serum , plasma , stool , intestinal lavage PBMC sample obtain , ETEC infection evaluate immune responses potential correlate protection .</detailed_description>
