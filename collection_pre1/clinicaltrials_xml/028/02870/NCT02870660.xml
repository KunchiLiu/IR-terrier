	<brief_summary>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) prevalent genetic disorder , define high cholesterol level premature death . The prevalence FH report country however unknown Iran . Thus recognize FH patient , determine diagnostic strategy appropriate treatment important . Also acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) group condition arise reduction blood flow coronary artery . Three specific condition include : ST elevation myocardial infarction , non ST elevation myocardial infarction unstable angina . Premature ACS define occurrence ACS &lt; 55 men ACS &lt; 60 woman . Studies demonstrate direct connection familial hypercholesterolemia occurrence premature ACS . Investigators intent detection FH amongst patient acute coronary syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Familial Hypercholesterolemia Amongst Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) genetic disorder , define high cholesterol level , particularly high level low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , blood early cardiovascular event premature death . FH autosomal dominant disease prevalence 1:500 ( new study Netherlands demonstrate 1:244 ) population frequent Cystic fibrosis , mellitus diabetes neonatal hypothyroidism . Canadian registry demonstrate FH common among specific population French Canadian , Christian Lebanese , Afrikaner descent . The Major cause FH pathogenic variant LDL-receptor ( LDLR ) gene Apo lipoprotein B ( APOB ) gene . The clinical sign FH high level Cholesterol ( 350-550 mg/dL heterozygous ) , Yellow deposit cholesterol-rich fat various place body around eyelid ( know xanthelasma palpebrarum ) , outer margin iris ( know arcus senilis cornea ) , tendon hand , elbow , knee foot , particularly Achilles tendon ( know tendon xanthoma ) .FH hidden syndrome lead cardiovascular disease . Acute coronary syndrome term use describe range condition associate sudden , reduced blood flow heart . A study Switzerland show 50 % patient premature ACS FH . Thus Investigators screen FH high probability amongst patient acute coronary syndrome . After introduce statin total mortality reduce significantly patient . Thus screen identification patient treatment effective therapy decrease risk premature death . Also , patient require appropriate lipid-lowering medication . Although genetic problem important factor expression FH , factor like environmental metabolic factor effective CVD premature death . Following score patient , one-year 30-day survival model create order ass effect elevate cholesterol survival , .</detailed_description>
