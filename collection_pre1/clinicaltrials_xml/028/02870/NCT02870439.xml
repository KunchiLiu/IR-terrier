	<brief_summary>Burn injury full-thickness skin damage encompass large body surface area induce local systemic perturbation costly term human suffer well strain health care system . Characterization new major molecular biomarkers involve process creates significant diagnostic therapeutic challenge . Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α ( HIF-1 α ) ubiquitously express heterodimeric transcription factor comprise α β subunit . It show normoxic condition , HIF-1α subunit ubiquitinated degraded , whereas hypoxic condition , HIF-1α accumulate , dimerizes HIF-1β , activate transcription spectrum target gene encode multiple angiogenic growth factor cytokines potential importance wound healing . Seven isoforms HIF-1α issue alternative splicing identify . The importance HIF-1α wound heal animal model suggest several study . Indeed , diminish HIF-1 level activity document condition impair wound healing . The literature review show mark reduction HIF-1α level mouse case burn wound skin case excisional cutaneous wound . Other study show expression HIF-1α correlate extent depth burn . This study aim improve knowledge pathophysiological factor involve field wound healing . The assumption base result study do mouse , work aim document finding human . Objective The main objective study compare variation expression HIF-1α measure blood skin tissue sample three group : - Subjects major burn wound involve 20 % total body surface area ; - Subjects burn wound small 5 % total body surface area ; - Subjects skin wound surgical procedure require skin resection . Secondary objective compare expression level HIF-1α locally burn site observe blood , evaluate expression growth factor produce HIF-1α target gene ( VEGF EPO ) play central role heal process ( TGF-β1 ) , assess correlation expression HIF-1α kinetics wound heal subject rat evaluation time donor site complete epithelialization . Material Methods We propose create three group : - 15 patient extensive third degree burn involve 20 % total body surface area ; - 15 patient less extensive third degree burn , involve less 5 % body surface area ; - 15 patient post-surgical wound skin resection . Skin tissue specimen collect three time : day 0 , 7 14 burn patient ( 20 % total body surface area le 5 % body surface area ) . Samples skin tissue collect within skin resection patient post-surgical wound day 0 , blood sample collect day 0 14 .</brief_summary>
