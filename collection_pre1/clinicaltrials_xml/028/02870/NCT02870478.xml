	<brief_title>The Effects Low Concentration Atropine Pupil Size Accommodation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myopia become epidemic developed country , particularly Asian country United States . Myopia , near-sightedness , result uncontrolled axial elongation eye . Besides need optical correction order see clearly , myopia result many sight-threatening complication , retinal thinning , retinal hole tear , retinal detachment , vascular proliferation . Atropine drop use clinical practice 100 year vary concentration different dose regimen . The propose small study seek establish evidence-based treatment ( dose ) guideline use low dose atropine myopia control . The specific objective study : 1 . To assess effect 0.01 % atropine 0.05 % atropine pupil dilation accommodation measure active drug level eye dose twice per week compare daily 2 . To assess subjective effect 0.01 % atropine 0.05 % atropine subject ' vision Participants ask attend one screen session total 8 test session . Following screen exam ( information collect screen form ) , subject randomly assign one four atropine treatment group , treat non-dominant eye : 1 . 0.01 % daily dose one week 2 . 0.01 % twice per week dose one week 3 . 0.05 % daily dose one week 4 . 0.05 % twice per week dose one week Once assign treatment group , subject two medication bottle use , label A B . The subject use bottle A administer drop Monday Thursday . Bottle B use administer drop every day week non-dominant eye . For subject treatment group 1 3 , medication bottle identical . For subject treatment group 2 4 , medication bottle A bottle B sterile saline . The investigator review subject instill medication properly home . Test session ( expect 30 min length ) hold twice per week test period schedule subject 's convenience . Session measurement include best-corrected visual acuity , subjective amplitude accommodation , objective amplitude accommodation , pupil size , describe previously ( see screen section 7b ) . An anterior segment slit lamp biomicroscopy exam also perform ensure good ocular health . The subject also ask fill brief symptom questionnaire ( attach ) present test session . Information record data collection sheet portion test . Once subject complete two week period ( total four session ) treatment group , subject release test `` wash period '' 1-2 week . At first day wash period , measurement pupil size accommodation take prior instillation single dose 0.01 % 0.05 % atropine , 1min , 5 min , 30 min , 1hr , 2hr , 4hr , 8hr post-instillation . The subject undergo total 2 full-day test session either two 0.01 % test period 0.05 % test period , .</detailed_description>
