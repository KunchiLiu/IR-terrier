	<brief_summary>For endoscopist , ERCP bile duct stone removal widely perform procedure . However , risk associate radiation exposure patient staff neglible . Earlier study , ERCP without use fluoroscopy report high success bile duct stone removal pregnant patient prevent radiation exposure fetus . EUS highy accurate technique detect common bile duct stone guide therapeutic intervention . There data literature show EUS guide CBD stone ( CBDS ) removal equivalent follow ERCP term successful CBDS removal complication . This randomized trial design address question EUS guide CBDS removal equivalent ERCP term efficacy safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS Guided ERCP Bile Duct Stone Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common bile duct stone ( CBDS ) complicate various condition include biliary pain , acute cholangitis , acute pancreatitis secondary biliary cirrhosis . CBDS therefore remove even patient asymptomatic . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) cornerstone treatment CBDS . ERCP often perform fluoroscopic guidance . This comprise biliary cannulation whereby bile duct achieve standard ERCP catheter fluoroscopy guidance , radiocontrast injected confirmation image biliary system , location number CBDS , biliary sphincterotomy perform follow stone extraction use standard accessory basket balloon . Therefore , endoscopist , endoscopic staff patient potentially expose ionize radiation ERCP . Endoscopists always attempt minimize radiation exposure personnel staff patient follow ALARA principle ( `` As Low As Reasonably Achievable '' ) . ERCP without use fluoroscopy one method avoid exposure radiation . A retrospective case series show ERCP perform high success rate without need fluoroscopic image . EUS proven diagnostic accuracy comparable ERCP diagnosis CBDS , 's associate low procedure relate complication non-radiation exposure procedure . With EUS perform ERCP , unnecessary ERCP related complication avoid patient without CBDS . In patient CBDS , image pancreaticobiliary tract derive EUS provide information regard location , size number CBDS guide therapeutic endoscopy , allow therapeutic ERCP session sedation . Vohra et al . report retrospective case series EUS - base ERCP 10 pregnant patient , show EUS perform prior ERCP eliminate unnecessary ERCP achieve CBDS clearance without use fluoroscopy . We previously report use EUS guide ERCP removal CBDS without fluoroscopy ( EGWF ) pilot study , show EGWF feasible select patient CBDS . The efficacy EUS guide ERCP CBDS removal without fluoroscopy compare standard ERCP fully assess . We therefore prospectively investigate efficacy safety EGWF versus ERCP CBDS removal large patient cohort .</detailed_description>
