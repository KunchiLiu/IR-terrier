	<brief_title>Prospective , Comparitive , Randomized Study Allograft Versus Skin Substitute Non-healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes affect least 9 % population , approximately 29 million people United States . Lower extremity ulcer serious complication people diabetes . Diabetic foot-related problem frequent cause hospitalization within group estimate total cost treatment range $ 10,000 nearly $ 60,000 depend ulcer severity clinical outcome . While many diabetic foot ulcer superficial heal conservative treatment , many severe recalcitrant standard care ( SOC ) . About quarter individual diabetes develop chronic non-healing ulcer lifetime nearly 60 every 10,000 individual diabetes undergo low extremity amputation . Holzer associate conduct retrospective analysis cost low extremity ulcer patient diabetes conclude , give high cost associate treat ulcer , development well treatment strategy warrant . One development treatment chronic wound use amniotic membrane graft . These material use successfully many year treatment orthopedic , plastic/reconstructive , urological application . Initial study demonstrate great success amnionic membrane graft heal chronic diabetic foot ulcer believe graft may superior old , common skin substitute .</detailed_description>
