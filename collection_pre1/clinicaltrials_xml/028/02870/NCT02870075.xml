	<detailed_description>Pre-trial assessment V̇O2max measurement V̇O2max determine use incremental continuous treadmill test point volitional exhaustion . For participant , treadmill speed 4 km/h gradient 8.5 % choose . Participants test speed gradient speed increase 1 km/h every 3 min stage . One minute expire air sample collect Douglas bag ( Douglas Bags , Hans Rudolph , MO , USA ) , RPE heart rate measure final minute stage also point volitional exhaustion , define participant indicate 1 min remain fatigue . Samples analyse relative expired fraction oxygen carbon dioxide gas ( Servomex , Crowborough , UK ) total volume bag measure use dry gas meter ( Harvard Apparatus , Kent , UK ) . Physical activity assessment Participants wear combined heart rate/accelerometer monitor one week ass habitual physical activity energy expenditure ( Actiheart , Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd. , Cambridge , UK ) . This attached leave chest via 2 adhesive ECG pad 24 hour per day except showering/bathing/swimming . Body composition analysis Body mass measure use digital scale post-void ( TANITA corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) . Waist hip circumference assess accord World Health Organisation guideline . Body composition determine use Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( Discovery , Hologic , Bedford , UK ) . Abdominal subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue ma estimate central region L1-L4 . Trial day In 72 h prior main trial , participant ask refrain perform strenuous physical activity consume alcohol/caffeine 48 h prior main trial . A dietary record complete 48 h first main trial participant ask replicate diet prior second main trial . On main trial day , participant arrive laboratory 8-9am follow 12 h fast . After anthropometric measurement , participant rest bed 15 minute , follow four 5 min expire gas sample collection determine rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) use substrate oxidation rest condition . Participants either consume meal ( FED ) remain fast ( FASTED ) cannula blood sample take every 15 minute follow 60 minute . A blood sample collect 120 min immediately walk protocol . In FASTED FED treatment , participant walk treadmill 60 % V̇O2max 60 minute one minute expire air sample , rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) heart rate collect 5 , 20 , 40 60 minute . After finish exercise , another blood sample immediately collect participant rest 60 minute . At point , second adipose tissue final blood sample take . Adipose tissue culture gene expression After adipose tissue biopsy cleaning , tissue mince approximately 5-10 mg directly place sterile culture plate ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) endothelial cell basal medium ( ECBM ) contain 0.1 % fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin 100 U ml-1 penicillin 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Gillingham , UK ) . Adipose tissue incubate final ratio 100mg tissue per 1 ml ECBM medium 3 hour . A 37°C , 5 % CO2 95 ± 5 % relative humidity incubator use ( MCO-18A1C CO2 incubator ; Sanyo , Osaka , Japan ) . Media transfer sterile eppendorfs store −80°C 3 hour incubation . Approximately 200 mg adipose tissue homogenise 5ml Trizol RNase/DNase-free sterile tube ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) store −80°C analysis . Sample size There data regard different dietary status ( feed versus fast ) affect acute response exercise overweight male . However , previous study use similar meal show feed enormous effect use lipid exercise - thus indicate role adipose tissue exercise would potentially different . In order see effect lipid oxidation exercise 95 % power 5 % alpha , would require 6-8 participant . To ensure result generalizable also account great variability outcome , recruit total 10 participant study . Statistics : All data present mean ± standard error mean ( SEM ) . Incremental area curve ( iAUC ) calculate use trapezoid method difference trial analyse use pair t-tests . Glucose , insulin , NEFA , TAG , adipokines , cell culture outcome determine use two-way ANOVA repeat measure use SPSS version 22 ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Where significant interaction ( trial × time ) find , post hoc analysis apply use t-test Holm-Bonferroni correction . Single comparison use t-test non-parametric equivalent . Statistical significance set p ≤ 0.05 .</detailed_description>
