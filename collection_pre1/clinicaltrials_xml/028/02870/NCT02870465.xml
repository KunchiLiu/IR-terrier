	<detailed_description>The main objective study analyze rate type infectious complication perform close reduction internal fixation ( CRIF ) hand fracture operate room versus ambulatory setting . The investigator prospectively collect data hand fracture database , record type fracture , handedness , co-morbidities , duration treatment , number K-wires , duration fixation complication rate . These record data collection form , transcribe password protect excel spread sheet Dr. Lalonde . The data de-identified patient assign number place data collection sheet depend order presentation . The investigator include adult patient present metacarpal phalangeal amenable CRIF K-wires . The investigator recruit patient prospectively emergency room clinic referral . All patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion ask participate attending surgeon resident . The patient assign number accord chronological presentation . The patient recruit academic center Canada . Three center , Halifax , Toronto McMaster , perform CRIF K-wires clinical setting thus represent main operating room cohort . The clinical setting CRIF cohort comprise patient St. John , Calgary , Ottawa , Vancouver St John 's CRIF hand fracture routinely perform local anaesthetic field sterility . The characteristic injury , fracture , time injury , patient comorbidities predispose infection , handedness , smoke status , sex age record . All procedure operate room clinic area perform anaesthetic standard center . A procedure deem `` field sterility '' usual surgical preparation povidone-iodine isopropyl alcohol-chlorohexidine gluconate sterile drape perform sterile glove mask without surgical gown . In outpatient clinic area , basic tray use along K-wire driver wire-cutters . A mini C-arm fluoroscopy machine use visualize reduction placement K-wires . The patient dress non-antibiotic contain dressing splint . The surgical information number type K-wires , OR time , type anaesthesia , place operation , antibiotic use record . There additional pin site care offer , standard accept method decrease pin-tract infection . They follow per local protocol . The patient instruct concerned regard complication infection must present attend surgeon plastic surgery colleague cover outpatient call . They provide contact number hour . The necessity contact attend team stress improve documentation complication ensure proper diagnosis infection make appropriate antibiotic coverage start . If patient present emergency department family physician , improper antibiotic coverage may start patient present normal wound healing , falsely elevate incidence record hand infection . The patient follow K-wire removal around 3 4 week , per local protocol , duration K-wire fixation record along complication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult patient present acute metacarpal phalangeal fracture amenable close reduction percutaneous pinning . 1 . Fractures reduce closed manner necessitate open reduction internal fixation 2 . Multiple fracture significant injury require ORIF mean plate fixation 3 . Existing infection 4 . Pathologic fracture 5 . CRIF perform replantation revascularization digit 6 . Concomitant injury ( tendon injury , nerve injury , soft tissue loss require reconstructive procedure graft flap ) 7 . Other disease accord investigator 's judgment</criteria>
