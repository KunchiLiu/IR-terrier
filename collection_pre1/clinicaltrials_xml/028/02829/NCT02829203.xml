	<brief_summary>Frailty important risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , recent data show significant association pre-frailty risk incident CVD , irrespective classical cardiometabolic risk factor , suggest target pre-frailty potentially reversible risk factor CVD elderly . Patients high level frailty increase risk post-operative period , time mechanical ventilation , length stay complication ( stroke death ) compare patient low frailty level . The investigator hypothesize pre-frailty patient also high surgical risk compare no-frailty patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study involve patient 65 year recruit Dante Pazzanese Institute Cardiology . The patient establish diagnosis cardiovascular disease ( myocardial infarction valve regurgitation ) previous electrocardiogram and/or Doppler echocardiography surgical indication ( coronary artery bypass , valve replacement combine surgery ) . Patients prior neurological disease ( previous stroke muscular dystrophy ) cognitive impairment result previous injury refuse participate study exclude . Twenty-four hour surgery patient evaluate Frailty score describe elsewhere divide 2 group : No-Frailty ( Frailty score 1 2 ) Pre-Frailty ( Frailty score 3 4 ) . If patient Frailty score high 5 exclude study . After surgery patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) follow institutional mechanical ventilation protocol . Immediately admission heart rate , mean arterial pressure , oxygen pulse saturation ( SpO2 ) measure Dixtal monitor ( DX 2010 ) . After ICU admission participant follow main outcome : hospital discharge , stroke , infection death . In addition investigator also measure length stay , duration mechanical ventilation , vasopressor usage need physiotherapy indication hospital discharge . All study participant receive medical physiotherapy care accord routine institution .</detailed_description>
