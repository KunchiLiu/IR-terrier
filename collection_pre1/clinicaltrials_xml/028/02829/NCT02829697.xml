	<brief_summary>The aim investigate effect perineural administration series different volume local anaesthesia ( ropivacaine 0.2 % ) nerve block duration variability duration common peroneal nerve sciatic nerve healthy volunteer . The hypothesis nerve block duration correlate local anaesthetic volume , certain degree . After sufficient volume 'saturation level ' reach , nerve block duration increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial divide two similar phase . Each phase focus specific nerve . Phase 1 focus common peroneal nerve Phase 2 focus sciatic nerve . After baseline measurement , investigator insert peripheral intravenous catheter . Then , investigator insert suture-method peripheral nerve catheter ( Certa CatheterTM ) . Procedures do sterile manner standard practice . The investigator use ultrasound ( US ) -guided short-axis , needle in-plane technique . For US-scan , investigator use linear curvilinear transducer . During intervention , volunteer monitor continuous pulse oximetry . Placement peripheral nerve catheter facilitate US use small injection mepivacaine ( carbocaine 2 % ) skin surround tissue isotonic saline ( 5 mL ) perineural space prevent block nerve ropivacaine injection . The catheter orifice place pull either end catheter guide built-in echogenic marking see US . Before injection ropivacaine , investigator careful aspiration catheter order prevent intravasal injection . Each ropivacaine injection administer via infusion pump . This ensure constant infusion rate set 10 mL per minute . During infusion , volunteer monitor continuous pulse oximetry . Before instigation ropivacaine infusion , investigator use US verify full absorption isotonic saline perineural space . For nerve , subject randomly allocate receive one five possible ropivacaine volume . All volunteer outcome assessor blind ropivacaine administration infusion procedure . Outcome assessor room , medication prepare give . Preparation take place behind curtain therefore also blind volunteer .</detailed_description>
