	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers test new method research project . They want see people respond different type communication , include video . They also want learn people respond life event pay attention computer task . They want learn various risk threat affect way people make decision . Objectives : To learn different stimuli event affect way people make decision . Eligibility : Adults age 18 old U.S. computer address Design : Participants recruit online . Participants take one three study online . Each study take half hour . Participants Study 1 watch short video popular movie answer question . They also complete 2 questionnaire . One likely think experience different risk threat . The goal behavior change . Participants Study 2 write detail life event . Then answer question . They also complete 2 questionnaire Study 1 . Participants Study 3 pay close attention word image computer . They answer question attitude toward different behavior , product , experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differential Influences Integral Incidental Emotion Cancer-related Judgments Decision Making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite evidence integral ( i.e. , related decision ) incidental ( i.e. , unrelated decision ) emotion influence cancer-related decision making , research systematically examine whether two type emotion generate similar pattern influence , predict decision-making model . This important incidental emotion often use experimentally draw causal conclusion emotion influence cancer-related decision notion result generalize produce knowledge integral emotion well . Across three study , plan directly compare integral incidental emotional influence judgment decision related cancer control . We plan examine whether effect contingent type emotional influence ( discrete emotion anger fear , general positive affect ) type emotion induction ( video , autobiographical induction , evaluative conditioning ) . Across experiment , predict emotion influence judgment decision-making outcome induced emotion integral well incidental . However , predict magnitude effect emotion type responses significantly great emotion integral judgment decision , compare emotion incidental .</detailed_description>
