	<brief_summary>There many health benefit associate consumption omega-3 dietary fat . Omega-3 fat , specifically eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , find marine food product fatty fish , fortify product eggs milk , dietary supplement fish oil . Despite numerous health benefit , well documented people Western society meeting recommend daily amount EPA DHA omega-3 fat . The overall objective study examine whether provide young adult ( 18-25 year ) personal genetic information change behavior regard omega-3 fat consumption . In order achieve objective , study participant divide two group : 1 . Genetic 2 . Non-Genetic . The Genetic Group provide personalize information regard common gene variant addition general information regard health benefit omega-3 fat , Non-Genetic Group receive general information . Primary outcomes study include dietary habit secondary outcome include blood marker cardiometabolic health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many health benefit associate consumption omega-3 dietary fat . Omega-3 fat , specifically eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , find marine food product fatty fish , fortify product eggs milk , dietary supplement fish oil . Despite numerous health benefit , well documented people Western society meeting recommend daily amount EPA DHA omega-3 fat . The numerous health benefit associate omega-3 fat well document scientific literature ; however , limited number study focus health effect omega-3 fat emerge adult ( 18-25 year ) . Indeed , research date conduct old adult , without hyperlipidemia . In addition , important consider intervention emerge adult give behaviour learn life stage persist later life . It also report diet quality ( i.e. , amount fruit , vegetable , whole grain , etc . ) reduce individual within age range ; thus highlight another important reason target demographic . The combination genetic dietary information ( i.e. , nutrigenetics ) potential benefit basic research , also general population . Therefore , research need determine provide individual genetic information potential encourage behaviour change . So far , several study investigate people may change behaviour response genetic risk information , none conduct nutrigenetic intervention examine provide personal genetic information alters diet behaviour . The overall objective study examine whether provide emerge adult personal genetic information change behavior regard omega-3 consumption . In order achieve objective , study participant divide two group : 1 . Genetic 2 . Non-genetic . The Genetic group provide personal information common gene variant addition general information regard health benefit omega-3 fat , Non-genetic group receive general information . Primary outcomes study include dietary habit secondary outcome include blood marker cardiometabolic health .</detailed_description>
