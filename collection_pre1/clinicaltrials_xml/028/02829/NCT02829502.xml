	<brief_title>The Effect GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonists widely use treatment type 2 diabetes ability mimic incretin hormone , GLP-1 . GLP-1 increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion thereby reduce glucose level . Over past year , GLP-1 receptor agonist investigate possible therapy neurological disorder , due ability cross blood-brain-barrier . Evidence treatment cerebrovascular diseases grow especially animal stroke model . GLP-1 receptor , locate central nervous system neuron endothelium , upregulated brain due ischemia . GLP-1 receptor agonist show anti-inflammatory anti-apoptotic property , may protect cell oxidative stress may protect endothelium . The inner lining blood vessel , endothelium , active component endocrine function . It affect formation blood clot play role disease mechanism stroke . The current acute prophylactic treatment stroke mainly target platelet function , endothelial function . This double-blinded , randomize , control , pilot trial investigates effect single dose GLP-1 receptor agonist , exenatide , cerebral blood flow velocity subacute phase stroke human . The primary endpoint mean flow velocity middle cerebral artery measure transcranial doppler cortical oxygination measure near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The secondary endpoint effect peripheral endothelium , hereby : 1 ) change reactive hyperaemia index measure EndoPAT2000 , 2 ) change ankle-brachial index , 3 ) change endothelial/inflammatory biomarkers blood . The primary secondary endpoint measure till three hour administration exenatide . The overall hypothesis GLP-1 receptor agonist may represent novel potential neuroprotective treatment stroke . Parallel study investigate effect GLP-1 receptor agonist people free cerebrovascular disease ( ref . EGRABINS1 ) .</detailed_description>
