	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation happen liver resection HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient , particularly positive serum HBV-DNA . The incidence rate risk factor HBV reactivation hepatectomy serum HBV-DNA negative HBV-related HCC unclear.From July 2012 December 2015 , 174 consecutive patient serum HBV-DNA negative HBV-related HCC underwent resection prospectively enrol study . There 66 patient receive preoperative antiviral therapy ( antiviral group ) 108 patient receive antiviral therapy ( non-antiviral group ) . The incidence HBV reactivation , risk factor liver function analyze perioperative period . HBV reactivation develop 30 patient ( 27.8 % ) non- antiviral group 2 patient ( 3.0 % ) antiviral group , respectively ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . Multivariate analysis reveal minor hepatectomy ( HR , 4.695 ; 95 % CI , 1.257-17.537 , P = 0.021 ) without antiviral therapy ( HR , 8.164 ; 95 % CI , 1.831-36.397 , p =0.006 ) risk factor attribute HBV reactivation . Patients antiviral group non-antiviral group reactivation group without reactivation group similar ALT , TBil , ALB , PT 7 day resection . However , patient antiviral group significantly well ALT ALB day 30th resection control group . Moreover , similar phenomenon observe compare without HBV reactivation . Resection could lead HBV reactivation perioperative period serum HBV DNA negative HBV-related HCC , especially patient receive antiviral therapy . Anti-HBV therapy reduce risk reactivation , thus improve liver function hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
