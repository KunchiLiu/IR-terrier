	<detailed_description>The combination anti-TNF alpha methotrexate may also prevent development antibody anti TNF alpha . Observational study indicate MTX dose-dependently inhibit development anti-drug antibody could reduce accelerated clearance biological agent associate loss therapeutic response inflammatory disease . Reduced ADA development influence positively clinical response therefore likely drug maintenance optimization drug pharmacokinetics serum anti TNF alpha trough concentration . In psoriasis , prospective evaluation combination MTX-anti TNF alpha help maintain long-term efficacy anti TNF alpha . Long-term maintenance treatment combination MTX infliximab report one small retrospective cohort study psoriasis patient experience loss response infliximab ( 55 ) . In total 23 patient receive rescue either azathioprine ( 5 patient ) weekly MTX ( 18 patient ) ( 7.5 15 mg , average 11.66 mg ) combination infliximab . After mean follow 26.5 month , 2 patient MTX combination stop infliximab loss response low compare 50 % loss response observe infliximab monotherapy ( 55 ) . The combination anti TNF alpha MTX also retrospectively assessed observational study . Most suggest systematic combination MTX biologic since anti TNF alpha initiation improve survival rate biologics ( 21 , 24 , 29 , 30 , 31 ) . A retrospective cohort study include 93 patient treat infliximab psoriasis show concomitant MTX average weekly dose dose 7.5 17.5 mg MTX enhance maintenance response prolong drug survival ( mean ± SD 19.5 ± 8.1 month , P = 0.034 ) ( 23 ) . In addition , time first infliximab dose escalation delay patient receive MTX ( mean ± SD 12.0 ± 6.1 month , P =0 .037 ) . In study , 2 year treatment , 25 % patient without MTX still initial infliximab regimen versus 40 % patient receive combination infliximab MTX ( 30 ) . The ability MTX prolong drug survival also suggest psoriatic arthritis several observational study ( 26 , 27 , 52 , 56 ) . In longitudinal observational study , 1-year retention rate anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medication patient RA PsA 65.4 % 77.3 % , respectively concomitant MTX associate good drug survival ( 52 ) . In study , combination MTX also associate crude 1-year survival 85 % PsA versus 70 % without concomitant MTX , p=0.02 ( 52 ) . In Danish biologics registry DANBIO , male sex , CRP level &gt; 10 mg/liter , concomitant methotrexate use , low patient health visual analog scale score baseline associate longer drug survival PsA patient ( 27 ) . To summarize , need improve drug survival well level response rate biologics , especially psoriasis patient . Low dos methotrexate combine biologics could option psoriasis patient solve crucial issue .</detailed_description>
