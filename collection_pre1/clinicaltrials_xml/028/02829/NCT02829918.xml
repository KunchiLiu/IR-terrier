Patients ampullary carcinoma eligible . Must fail intolerant one line systemic treatment 2 prior line systemic chemotherapy advance BTC . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy evidence disease recurrence within 6 month completion adjuvant treatment also eligible . If patient receive adjuvant treatment disease recurrence 6 month , patient eligible fail intolerance one line systemic chemotherapy use treat disease recurrence . Age â‰¥ 18 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status Assessment 0 1 . Must radiographic measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . Life expectancy least 12 week ( 3 month ) . For patient receive prior radiation , cryotherapy , radiofrequency ablation , therasphere , ethanol injection , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) photodynamic therapy , follow criterion must meet : 28 day elapse since therapy ; Lesions treat local therapy must present measureable . Must able understand willing sign write informed consent form . Must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , study requirement . All acute toxic effect prior treatment resolve NCICTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 less time signing Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) except alopecia . Adequate bone marrow , liver liver function . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start study drug . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception begin sign ICF least 3 month last dose study drug . Patients history hepatitis B hepatitis C eligible patient hepatitis B must start antiviral therapy prior begin study therapy . Availability archival tumor tissue biomarkers analysis ( FFPE block cell block require ) . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) . If CNS metastases treat potential participant neurologic baseline least 2 week prior enrollment , eligible need Brain MRI prior enrollment . Must corticosteroid dose less 10 mg per day . Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Potential participant vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . A condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day enrollment . Inhaled topical steroid , adrenal replacement steroid dose &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent , permit absence active autoimmune disease . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) .
