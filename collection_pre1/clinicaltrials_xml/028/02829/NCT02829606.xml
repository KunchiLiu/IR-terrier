	<brief_summary>A device develop eye tracker integrate within Head Mounted Display ( HMD ) remap text image around scotoma real time prevent information loss central scotoma . It also carry type image processing contrast enhancement image magnification . The aim study ass efficacy device visual performance participant suffer central vision loss , without remapping</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Head Mounted Eye Tracking Aide Loss Central Vision ( HETALCEV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants bilateral central scotoma select study routine clinical visit University Minnesota Eye Clinic . Written consent obtain participant . Each participant scotoma map use Nidek MP-1 microperimeter house psychology department give exact size shape information . This allow extent eye 's scotoma put remapping software , intersection use remapping calculation . Comparisons make participant small scotoma , less 5 degree , participant large scotoma , large 5 degree . Experiments perform device also divide two category . Category 1 involve read naturalistic text , everyday task performance . Category 2 involves study effect practice device performance category 1 experiment . Participants schedule initial one-hour session test . During test , participant tell device functionality . Main instruction include patient expect experience see wear HMD . Following , participant instruct wear HMD . If glasses/ corrective lens , keep . Once patient HMD , test begin . Initially , calibration-free mode test . This entail ask subject focus particular point screen check gaze point determine eye tracker correspond point . If good calibration obtain , investigator proceed test . Otherwise , 3-point calibration sequence initiate follow instruction software program . For 3-point calibration sequence , participant instructed fixate 3-5 different point screen one time . Following calibration sequence , test resume visual performance read speed words/minute measure primary outcome measure , without remapping .</detailed_description>
