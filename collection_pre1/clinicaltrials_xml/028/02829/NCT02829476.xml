	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) common spine pathology . It oppose secondary scoliosis due chronic disease . Many hypothesis make elucidate origin illness . Recently , melatonin pathway investigated pinealectomy chicken create scoliosis resembles AIS melatonin supplementation reverse process . In addition administration melatonin AIS patient improved pathology . However hypothesis show controversial result . Recent study demonstrate melatonin cellular resistance osteoblastic cell AIS patient . Melatonin act G protein couple receptor ( GPCR ) , mainly use Gi pathway . In AIS osteoblast , pathway block leading decrease inactivation adenylyl cyclase therefore maintenance high level cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) concentration cell . As modulation cAMP important osteogenesis resistance may critical initiation development AIS . Gi signalization use several GPCR , thus , hormonal resistance could logically find hormonal mediator pathway . A precedent study previously focus ghrelin AIS , demonstrate AIS patient possess elevate plasmatic value ghrelin . This study also observe decreased response ghrelin AIS culture osteoblast .</brief_summary>
