	<brief_summary>Brief Summary : This randomized clinical pilot test feasibility individual self-monitor 12 week base participant record give feedback message . The investigator use information refine question data collection procedure large study . Participants randomize 3 group - self-monitoring - self-monitoring w/ feedback message - self-monitoring w/feedback message group session Feedback message deliver 4 time per day use different schedule . The group session hold 2nd , 4th 8th week 12-week study . All participant ask complete questionnaire 2 assessment visit baseline 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Receiving Feedback Messages Based Self-monitored Dietary Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Strategy . The investigator randomize 45 overweight/obese adult one 3 group : ( 1 ) Control ( Con ) - FB , Behavioral Lifestyle Program ( BLP ) , ( 2 ) FB Only , BLP , ( 3 ) FB+BLP . All subject use smartphone self-monitor diet PA . The subject download feedback system onto Android operate system smartphone develop study call SMARTER . The algorithm develop Dr. Lora Burke University Pittsburgh . All group attend one-time self-monitor use smartphone session receive education material baseline . The FB Only FB+BLP group receive 4 daily FB message , base progress attain target behavior . The FB deliver variable ratio schedule tailor data subject ' recording . FB+BLP participant receive face-to-face BLP intervention include 3 group session 12 week . Also confound effect daily FB , interventionists provide feedback weekly diary . Sample . The investigator recruit community 45 adult , age 18 . All participant need randomize prior begin 3 BLP session since session conduct close group . The randomization scheme implement via computerized program ( Visual Basic 6.0 ) use minimization method . The randomization overseen statistician ( Co-I : S Sereika ) . Each 3 condition assign total 15 subject randomization stratify gender ethnicity/race . Intervention . Those Con FB Only group receive 1-hr session provide calorie prescription weight loss self-monitoring associate education material . Only FB+BLP receive 3-session BLP healthful lifestyle weight loss . The group meet School Nursing lead trained interventionist . Protocol Self-monitoring : All participant subscribe LoseIt ! , online self-monitoring service access via smartphone computer . This used place traditional paper diary . This software permit self-monitoring diet , PA , weight ; also provide feedback 9 macronutrients base database 60,000 food . Because investigator 's ongoing work relationship developer LoseIt ! program , investigator access LoseIt ! Connect , custom portal create LoseIt ! centralize user management . This permit investigator view participant ' entry set custom control participant use , ( e.g. , disable particpants ' ability share data outsider ) . All participant encourage self-monitor diet self-report weight . Participants scale give one duration study ask return completion study . Participants see nutrient value food calculate subtotal . The interventionists access diary participant contact participant concern report eating behavior . This procedure use past 4 year EMPOWER Study ( IRB - PRO10100504 ) . At train session , participant advise change privacy setting Lose It ! . General Information Feedback Algorithm . The FB algorithm program FB app use real-time sync self- monitoring data send message responsive participant ' entry . The server deliver message display screen smartphones person need make extra click view . The FB message address one target behavior time , e.g. , self-monitoring calorie intake . At baseline education session FB Only group first BLP session FB+BLP , individual make diary entry ; system send FB message shortly thereafter provide immediate reinforcement self-monitoring . Then FB deliver incremental 1-4 x/d schedule , contingent progress self-monitoring attain person 's daily calorie goal . Rules apply delivery message FB Only FB+BLP , e.g. , message deliver hour set participant particpants phone , e.g. , 8 AM 9:30 PM , content guide parameter build algorithm . In implementation propose FB intervention , investigator exercise caution sensitivity regard participant ' reception message . In SMART Trial , message motivate reinforce , note deficiency behavior progress make ; however , message provide guidance corrective action person follow behavior would consistent pre-established goal . Space permit extensive message sample example might follow . Excellent job increase fruit diet . OR Super job stay within fat limit . Go easy high fat food tonight ; consider big salad nonfat dress . Protocol Behavioral Lifestyle Program ( BLP ) intervention : Group Sessions : Participants receive nutritional behavioral counseling ; practical hands-on experience develop skill implement healthy lifestyle ( e.g. , practice mindful eating , portion size , modify food meal reduce fat content ) three 1 hour group session . The group meet evening lead multidisciplinary team ( behavioral scientist , nutritionist train PI Co-I ( Burke Ewing ) . The group session hold 2nd , 4th 8th week 12-week study . Behavior Goals : Calorie : The calorie goal calculate individual 's baseline body weight ( 1200 - 1800 kcal &lt; 250 lb 1800 2000 kcal &gt; 250 lb ) . Calorie goal adjust necessary participant struggle meet goa ; maintenance . Fat : Fat gram goal 40 - 60 gram per day depend calorie goal . Screening Measures - administer baseline . Sociodemographic Form use collect data individual characteristic , e.g. , ethnicity , marital status . Rapid Eating Assessment Patients ( REAP ) use assess current diet inform goal lifestyle improvement . It 31 item ask weight , PA sedentary habit , variety diet , excess food intake . Participants Online Screening Questionnaire use assess Qualtric system screen tool . It give screen questionnaire Baseline Assessment . Outcome Dependent Measures . Unless otherwise note , measure conduct 0 12 week . Trained staff perform Clinical Research Suite School Nursing . Participants compensate complete 12-week assessment . BMI- Weight - measure Tanita Scale Body Fat Analyzer subject light clothe stand bare foot scale 's footpad . Height ( centimeter ) measure stadiometer BMI ( kg/m2 ) calculation . Cardiometabolic risk factor Blood pressure ( BP ) . BP assessment follow standard AHA guideline measure use Omron BP Monitor ComFit cuff subject sit position least 5-min rest . Whole body composition . To describe % fat mass , measure body composition ( fat mass , % fat , fat-free mass ) bioelectrical impedance analysis Tanita Scale Body Fat Analyzer.120 Waist circumference measure twice Gullick II measuring tape . If two value within 2 cm , mean calculate ; , measurement take within 2 cm . Psychosocial survey . Weight Efficacy Lifestyle ( WEL ) 20-item scale use assess level confidence resist eat varied situation emotional state . It establish psychometric property 135 take 5 min complete . This scale add explanatory value weight loss behavior previous study . The Newest Vital Sign , brief test literacy apply read food label . At completion study , group randomize group session receive session material via email . The group receive feedback message give option receive message 12 week . If participant chooses feedback message , load participant 's phone 12 week assessment .</detailed_description>
