	<detailed_description>This study evaluate diagnostic accuracy dynamic infrared thermography compare mammography ( reference test ) breast cancer diagnostics . Dynamic infrared thermography ( DIRT ) imagine procedure offering non-invasive , painless examination without risk radiation . Dynamic infrared thermography provide information morphological characteristic breast , rather provide functional information thermal vascular condition tissue ( Fitzgerald , 2012 ) . During study period April 2009 June 2012 , total 168 woman age 50-70 year recall assessment positive mammography screening offer dynamic infrared thermography test ( clinical mammography , clinical examination necessary breast tissue biopsy ) . Radiographers Breast Diagnostic Center ( BDS ) University Hospital North Norway collect information parity , menopausal status , use hormone therapy size bra . The radiographer also carry dynamic infrared thermography examination . PI Ã…shild O. Miland Professor James B. Mercer interpret thermogram enter data thermography database . Both blinded assessment ( mammography , clinical examination biopsy ) non talk participant examination . The health professional responsible woman mammography , clinical examination biopsy blind result infrared digital thermography examination . They allow ask woman infrared digital thermography examination . The three radiologist BDS make interpretation mammography enter data digital patient journal mammography database The Norwegian Cancer Registry . One radiologist take , necessary , breast biopsy . A breast surgeon responsible clinical breast examination . Pathologists verify histology . Breast radiologist Jan Ole Frantzen researcher Merethe Kumle , MD , PhD collect information breast cancer result digital patient journal Roentgen information system ( RIS ) enter separate mammography database . The thermography database mammography database still merge time registration ClinicalTrials.gov ( March 2015 ) .</detailed_description>
