	<detailed_description>Meal time differ culture culture . These difference may influence energy regulation , consequently , body weight . Current study support notion `` '' also `` '' investigator eat may significant role obesity treatment . Recently , show eat main meal day , lunch Spain , late day predictive difficulty weight loss decrease insulin sensitivity . Furthermore , show eat late night plasma melatonin concentration elevate , impairs glucose tolerance , particularly MTNR1B risk allele carrier . The main objective identify mechanism underlie association time food intake , obesity metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) order design effective weight loss therapy . The long-term goal determine potential impact European , i.e. , early meal time obesity , MetS weight loss . The challenge society develop evidence-based dietary intervention incorporate meal time genotype combat epidemic obesity MetS . These goal achieve three specific approach : - Epidemiological ( observational study ) ( Aim 1 ) : To assess obese population ( n=5000 ) follow weight loss program clock-related ( CLOCK , PER2 , CRY , etc . ) melatonin-related variant ( MTNR1B ) interact time food intake determine weight loss effectiveness MetS feature . - Interventional ( randomize control trial ) ( Aim 2 ) : To determine internal mechanism energy balance circadian system implicate differential effect food timing ( lunch ) weight loss , MetS alterations intestinal microbiota ( n=25 ) , study potential interaction meal timing ( dinner ) genetic variant MTNR1B glucose tolerance obese woman ( n=100 ) .</detailed_description>
