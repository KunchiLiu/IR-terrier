	<brief_title>Low -Dose-bevacizumab Pemetrexed Versus TPC Metastatic HER2-negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There standard therapy advance human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer patient failure taxanes anthracycline-containing regimen present . Pemetrexed multitargeted antimetabolite . Its efficacy metastatic breast cancer confirm several small sample size study meta-analyses . Its response rate ( RR ) 30 % , high HER2-negative breast cancer . However , study focus subtype breast cancer . Bevacizumab also effective alternative metastatic breast cancer . Several study indicate combination bevacizumab chemotherapy could improve RR overall survival , use confine severe side effect far adequate treatment . Recent year , lot study assess efficacy metronomic chemotherapy . Metronomic therapy refers chronic administration low dos cytotoxic drug close , regular interval . It could promote apoptosis tumor endothelial cell , continuously inhibit tumor angiogenesis , exhibit significant superiority low toxicity , reduce cost prolonged combination therapy period . According report literature , expression anti-angiogenic biomarkers , , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -A , VEGF-C , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( sVEGFR ) -1 , sVEGFR-2 , thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) , platelet factor 4 ( PF-4 ) might concern efficacy metronomic therapy . Since report clinical trial accord metronomic bevacizumab HER2-negative breast cancer , investigator come study . In study , investigator try make comparison efficacy safety low-dose-bevacizumab pemetrexed treatment physician 's choice ( TPC ) metastatic breast cancer failure taxanes anthracycline-containing regimen , validate correlative biomarkers find optimal choice previously treat metastatic breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
