	<brief_title>Treating Tinnitus Using Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program : A Randomized , Double-blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Tinnitus , define perception sound correspond external auditory stimulus exists , debilitate condition widespread yet difficult successfully treat . It estimate 10 % 15 % adult population experience tinnitus degree . Although many people tinnitus disturbed sensation , condition disable 0.5 % 2 % tinnitus population 1.4 5 million people ( Bauer &amp; Brozoski , 2006 ) . Additionally , tinnitus among prevalent service-connected disability veteran receive compensation accord VA 2010 Annual Benefits Report , impact half million veteran ( US Department Veterans Affairs , 2010 ) . The impact tinnitus patient 's quality life devastate ( Tyler &amp; Baker , 1983 ) . Many patient report intrusive perception sound - ringing , roaring , buzz - interferes ability relax , sleep concentrate , especially quiet situation . Many tinnitus patient also report reduce tolerance loud sound , tend avoid noisy ( e.g . social ) situation . The disturbing effect condition lead desperate sense loss control . Until recently , treatment clinically validate consistently effective . Despite advance understand tinnitus condition , Neurophysiological Model ( Jastreboff &amp; Hazell , 1993 ) , promise much improve outcomes treatment yet realize general clinical practice . Previously available treatment option continue limited lack clinically consistent efficacy , efficiency , and/or user acceptability . Even Tinnitus Retraining Therapy ( TRT ) , widely advocate practical application principle Neurophysiological Model , recently report yield modest outcome , require extend period time ( 24 month ) achieve outcomes high proportion patient ( J . A. Henry et al. , 2005 ) . Notably , report ( Dineen , Doyle , Bench , &amp; Perry , 1999 ; Hiller &amp; Haerkotter , 2005 ; McKinney , Hazell , &amp; Graham , 1999 ; Schmitt &amp; Kroner-Herwig , 2002 ; Tyler , 2004 ) question whether acoustic stimulation use tinnitus management program TRT , predominantly consist broadband noise generator hear aid , provide real incremental benefit counseling component program . Furthermore , hear aid noise generator show provide limited clinical benefit use tinnitus management program ( Hiller &amp; Haerkotter , 2005 ; Moffat et al. , 2009 ) , technology limit problem user acceptability . Many tinnitus sufferer report find hearing aid intolerable wear due decrease sound tolerance together unpredictability amplify ambient sound . Similarly , many people fit noise generator find sound produce unpleasant listen extend period day use recommend . As result , hear aid noise generator , return-for-credit `` left-unused-in-the-drawer '' rate high ( J.A . Henry , Schecthter , Nagler , &amp; Fausti , 2002 ; Hiller &amp; Haerkotter , 2005 ) . Recent research pathogenesis tinnitus emphasize role neurological change result damage auditory system ( Tyler , 2005 ) . These change include brain 's adaptive response auditory starvation ( lead increase sensitivity system ) , initial perception sound , system within brain determine person 's attention reaction . The Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program ( NTTP ) take account neural plasticity underlies tinnitus target neurological change cause . It utilize acoustic stimulus combine music embed neural stimulus , spectrally modify customized patient 's hearing tinnitus profile . By account patient 's hearing loss , NTTP provide broadband neural stimulus stimulate neural pathway `` starve '' due auditory damage and/or hearing loss . The NTTP stimulus also positively engage limbic system reduce stress cause tinnitus . A key benefit customization process allow stimulus use comfortably low listen level . By allow intermittent , momentary perception tinnitus within pleasant relax listen experience , desensitize patient 's reaction tinnitus , thereby lead long-term reduction tinnitus disturbance . The NTTP clinically proven civilian population : ( 1 ) reduce symptom early treatment , particular , provide relief disturb effect condition , ( 2 ) treat neurological cause associate tinnitus , ( 3 ) provide long-term relief improvement quality life , ( 4 ) convenient noninvasive . The NTTP subject series publish clinical study civilian subject ( P. B. Davis , 2005 ; P. B. Davis , Paki , &amp; Hanley , 2007 ; P.B . Davis , Wilde , &amp; Steed , 2002 ; P. B. Davis , Wilde , Steed , &amp; Hanley , 2008 ; Hanley , Davis , Paki , Quinn , &amp; Bellekom , 2008 ) , demonstrate yield well result , quickly , consistently , intervention acceptable patient prior approach . Included among clinical study comparative study ( P. B. Davis et al. , 2008 ) show Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment generate significantly great consistent improvement tinnitus symptom treatment comprise counsel plus broad band noise ( 'white noise ' ) well outcomes counseling-alone . While efficacy NTTP demonstrate , remain expensive somewhat time-consuming treatment strategy . A previous study ( Karch , Hill , Casto , Nedostup , &amp; Staton , 2014 ) indicate COTS sound therapy may also effective way treat tinnitus . Preliminary analysis subjective tinnitus measure Karch ( 2014 ) indicate NTTP strategy effective reduce negative effect tinnitus ( i.e . reduction subjective effect tinnitus measure Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire ( TRQ ) , tinnitus awareness time , tinnitus disturbance time ) . Similar result see COTS group , statistically significant difference pre- post-treatment measure TRQ tinnitus awareness . Analysis clinical measure associate tinnitus suggest difference pre- post-treatment mask level require cover tinnitus level loudness discomfort associate tinnitus either group . However , due small sample size unequal group , comparison treatment Karch et al . study ( 2014 ) make cautiously . MILITARY RELEVANCE Tinnitus among prevalent medical complaint soldier return Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom ( OIF/OEF ) . Soldiers clinically significant level tinnitus often suffer anxiety , depression , sleep disruption , difficulty concentrate . Currently , standard tinnitus treatment protocol military system limit clinical efficacy NTTP COTS tinnitus treatment support control study . The propose research attempt definitively establish value NTTP military setting . The study stress return-to-duty Soldiers experience severe tinnitus might otherwise prevent Soldiers deploy unit . Retention fit force improve quality life active-duty Soldiers important issue associate successful approach treatment tinnitus . OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS The objective study determine effectiveness individualize sound stimulus use FDA classify tinnitus masker device , Neuromonics , Inc. Oasis™ . Research Question : Is difference clinical outcome tinnitus patient treat NTTP compare treatment use placebo-control device ? The placebo-control device otherwise identical NTTP device except sound stimulus match patient ' audiogram tinnitus profile specifically design promote relaxation . Assignment tinnitus patient treatment placebo group perform site experimenter information group assignment . Hypothesis : In Active Duty , Reserve , National Guard military recently separate veteran population complaint tinnitus , NTTP group significantly improve tinnitus clinical outcome comparison placebo-control group 6 month . Clinical outcome describe Section B5.4 Table 1 . Null Hypothesis : In Active Duty , Reserve , National Guard military recently separate veteran population complaint tinnitus , NTTP group tinnitus clinical outcome statistically indistinguishable placebo-control group 6 month .</detailed_description>
