	<brief_title>Peritoneal Ultrafiltration Treat Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) lead cause acute hospital admission . The morbidity associate condition present major health economic challenge , anticipated increase age population especially developed country . Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient diuretic resistant cardio-renal syndrome type 2 enable low-molecular weight solute clearance ultrafiltration ( UF ) without serious hemodynamic change , make modality attractive chronic CHF treatment . The key practical advantage PD patient treat home , treatment adjustment accordance current condition . The additional advantage : continuous UF , flexible schedule , need device anticoagulation , need medical staff . Despite fact significant improvement survival CHF patient treat PD , compare regular treatment , improvement symptom , physical performance , quality life , biochemical profile , significant decrease hospitalization rate report . PD number theoretical practical advantage extend treatment CHF patient , little experience field limit knowledge regard influence peritoneal membrane renal function patient moderate renal failure . Aims study : 1. primary aim - find survival benefit PD treatment , reduce hospitalization rate improve QOL , compare functional outcome CHF patient 1 year dialysis treatment PD treatment different type PD fluid 2. secondary aim - choose optimal type dialysis treatment term effective UF , preservation peritoneal membrane residual renal function . Research question : Whether UF improve survival QOL patient severe CHF . What modes PD HD treatment ensure least possible negative impact peritoneal membrane residual renal function ? Research hypothesis : UF improves survival QOL patient severe CHF . Low glucose dialysis solution preferable treatment CHF patient PD preservation residual renal function peritoneal membrane characteristic . Possible risk prevent : early peritoneal membrane failure deterioration renal function , symptom fluid overload need inpatient treatment . Type study : observational prospective Population : CHF patient refer nephrologist home-based UF ( PD ) medical hemodialysis treatment Inclusion criterion : - diagnosis heart failure NYHA 3-4 maximal treatment evidence diuretic resistance repeat hospital admission due fluid overload ( least 2 previous 3 month ) - evidence CKD stage 3-4 - agreement place dialysis catheter peritoneal cavity PD treatment IV access hemodialysis - available medical record 1 year dialysis treatment Exclusion criterion : - unstable hemodynamic respiratory condition - need vasopressor support - patient refusal - lack family support housing condition need PD treatment - evidence active kidney disease ( obstructive uropathy , glomerulonephritis , vasculitis etc . ) recruitment study Accrual rate : 10 -20 patient per year , 40-80 patient overall Enrolment mode : The patient refer peritoneal dialysis center treat nephrologist cardiologist . After identification approval candidate dialysis nurse , incident patient meet inclusion criterion , refer peritoneal catheter insertion . Intervention : PD catheter insertion nephrologist surgeon PD treatment dialysis fluid accord clinical need patient . Monitoring clinical symptom fluid overload , hospital admission , UF rate , peritoneal membrane damage parameter ( cell-free DNA peritoneal effluent , peritoneal equilibration test ) residual renal function marker ( eGFR creatinine base , KT/V , urinary marker , PET ) start treatment , 3 month treatment change prescription . Complications kinds record . Comparison group : CHF patient refer nephrologist home-based UF ( PD ) treatment preferred continue conventional treatment .</detailed_description>
