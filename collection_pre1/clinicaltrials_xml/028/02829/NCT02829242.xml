	<brief_summary>Some robotic endoscopic surgery require steep Trendelenburg position carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum . This minimally invasive approach advantage less postoperative pain , short hospital stay faster recovery . After prolonged operative time Trendelenburg position rare significant complication cerebral oedema well leg compartment syndrome . Well leg compartment syndrome result inadequate perfusion lower limbs perfusion pressure decrease proportionally low extremity elevation . The condition lead release intracellular protein myoglobinuria , hyperpotassaemia metabolic acidosis follow cell necrosis . The risk tissue damage increase 4 hour Trendelenburg position . If promptly diagnose treat , compartment syndrome devastate complication like permanent dysfunction , limb loss , renal failure even death . There specific guideline diagnosis time surgical decompression . Fasciotomy clinical decision . There universal agreement compartment pressure irreversible muscle damage occur . The objective diagnostic tool available currently measure intramuscular pressure , however invasive , painful may yield unreliable result . An intracompartment pressure 0- 10mm Hg normal range . Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor validate approved measure cerebral somatic tissue oxygenation sensor may help detect promptly compartment syndrome . Therefore , investigator design present study detect change tissue oxygenation lower legs robotic assist , laparoscopic surgery Trendelenburg position .</brief_summary>
