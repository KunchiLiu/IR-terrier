	<brief_summary>This 24-week , Phase 3 , open-label , non-comparative , multicentre study aim evaluate efficacy safety GSK1278863 Japanese hemodialysis ( HD ) patient renal anemia use erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) . The primary objective evaluate initial response GSK1278863 measure hemoglobin ( Hgb ) level HD patient use ESAs enrol study . The study design evaluate appropriateness start dose GSK1278863 GSK1278863 dose adjustment regimen achieve maintain target Hgb level . This study consist 4-week screening period , 24-week treatment period ( 4-week fixed-dose period 20-week dose adjustment period ) , 2- 4-week follow-up period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ( time inform consent ) : &gt; =20 year Dialysis : Patients hemodialysis ( HD ) hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) Use erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) : Newly start dialysis ( Dialysis newly start &lt; 12 week screen ) : Patients use ESAs start dialysis ; Maintenance dialysis ( Dialysis start &gt; =12 week screen ) : Patients use ESAs within 8 week screen ( include interruption ESA therapy ) Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) : &gt; =8.0 &lt; 10.0 g/dL ( measure use pointofcare Hgb measurement device study site Day 1 ) Iron parameter : Ferritin &gt; 100 nanogram ( ng ) /milliliter ( mL ) transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) &gt; 20 % ( screen ) Gender ( screen ) : Female male . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] test female reproductive potential [ FRP ] ) , breastfeed , least one follow condition applies : Females nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal one follow plan utilise assist reproductive technique ( example [ e.g . ] , vitro fertilisation donor embryo transfer ) : document bilateral tubal ligation salpingectomy ; document hysteroscopic tube occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; hysterectomy ; document bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal define female 60 year age older In female &lt; 60 year age , 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( In questionable case , blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause confirmatory [ reference value provide separately ] ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . Females reproductive potential agree follow one option list `` GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential '' 28 day first dose study treatment completion followup visit . Informed consent : Subjects provide write informed consent study , involve compliance requirement patient responsibility state consent form protocol . CKD related criterion Kidney transplant : Planned live kidney transplant study period Anemiarelated criterion Aplasia : History bone marrow aplasia pure red cell aplasia Other cause anemia : Pernicious anemia , thalassaemia , sickle cell disease , myelodysplastic syndrome Gastrointestinal bleeding : Evidence actively bleed gastric , duodenal , esophageal ulcer disease clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 8 week screen period screen Day 1 . Cardiovascular diseaserelated criterion History myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , stroke transient ischemic attack : Diagnosed within 8 week screen period screen Day 1 . Heart failure : Class IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) ( screen ) : QTc &gt; 500 millisecond ( msec ) , QTc &gt; 530 msec subject bundle branch block . Note : Corrected QT interval use Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) ( machineread manually ) use . Other diseaserelated criterion Liver disease ( follow occurs ) : Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( If bilirubin fraction measure direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % , isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable . ) Current unstable active liver biliary disease ( generally define onset ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , esophageal/gastric varix , persistent jaundice , cirrhosis ) . Note : The exception squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin definitively treat &gt; =8 week screen . Malignancy : History malignancy within two year prior screen , know complex kidney cyst &gt; 3 centimeter ( cm ) ( II F , III IV base Bosniak classification ) currently receive treatment cancer . Note : The exception squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin definitively treat &gt; =8 week screen . Concomitant medication study treatmentrelated criterion Iron medication : Planned use intravenous iron screen period Day 1 Week 4 . Note : Patients oral iron may enrol iron dose regimen unchanged screening period Day 1 Week 4 . Patients antihyperphosphatemia medication contain iron ( e.g. , ferric citrate hydrate ) least 12 week screen may enrol medication continue screen Day 1 Week 4 . Severe allergic reaction : History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity excipients investigational product Drugs dietary supplement : Current use prohibit prescription drug , nonprescription drug , dietary supplement plan use drug study period ( prohibit drug : strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C8 inducer inhibitor ) Exposure investigational product : Use investigational product within past 30 day five half live investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Prior treatment GSK1278863 : Prior treatment GSK1278863 &gt; 30 day General healthrelated criterion Other condition : Any condition , clinical laboratory abnormality , examination find investigator considers would put subject unacceptable risk , may affect study compliance prevent understand aim investigational procedure possible consequence study .</criteria>
