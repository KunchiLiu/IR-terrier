	<detailed_description>A risk stratification hemodynamically stable patient acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) deem necessary guide patient management . Right ventricular dysfunction ( RVD ) , identify echocardiography compute tomographic angiography ( CT ) , cardiac biomarkers well recognize risk factor adverse event normotensive patient PE . However , neither , single prognostic criterion , sufficient positive predictive value ( PPV ) PE-related adverse event guide therapeutic decision . The PEITHO trial show , normotensive patient RVD abnormal cardiac troponin , death hemodynamic decompensation occur significantly less treated tenecteplase plus heparin receive heparin plus placebo . However risk major hemorrhage stroke significantly increased tecneplase group . These result obtain group patient absolute rate PE-related adverse event 6 % . If relative reduction risk PE-related outcome observe PEITHO trial could achieve group patient higher absolute risk PE-related event , might change risk benefit ratio primary reperfusion therapy PE . With aim improve PPV PE-related adverse event normotensive patient , number score combine multiple risk-factors publish . In addition , algorithm risk-stratification patient PE propose European society cardiology . None one score underwent external prospective validation . Aim study The aim study externally prospectively validate PPV PE-related adverse event Bova score modify FAST score large multicenter cohort . We evaluate potential additive prognostic value combination Bova score lactate , prognostic performance RVD diagnose echocardiography compare RVD detect CT. Methods . This multicenter , prospective , observational study . Consecutive patient age 18 year old PE hemodynamic stability ( , SBP 90 mm Hg ) evaluate part usual clinical practice . This study dictate diagnostic intervention affect clinical therapeutic decision participant center . For patient , anonymous information collect simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index ( sPESI ) , RVD echocardiography CT , Troponin I , level lactate arterial blood , presence syncope presentation . RVD diagnose echocardiography presence one following : Right ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( RVEDD ) &gt; 30 mm ( parasternal long-axis short-axis view ) , Right/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( RVEDD/LVEDD ) &gt; 0.9 ( apical subcostal 4-chamber view ) , Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis view , Tricuspid systolic velocity &gt; 2.6 m/s apical subcostal 4-CH view , parasternal short-axis view . RVD diagnosis CT require RV/LV diameter ratio great 1.0 axial CT image . Cardiac troponin test consider positive case level troponin high high cut-off manufacturer . Plasma lactate assess arterial blood sample . Values â‰¥ 2 mmol/L ( 18 mg/dL ) consider abnormal . This evaluation ideally complete within 6 hour hospital admission . The primary outcome study adverse event PE-related within 30 day hospital admission . In sensitivity analysis explore outcome 7 day . PE-relate adverse event define : PE-related death haemodynamic collapse . PE consider cause death objective documentation case unexplained death PE confidently rule . Haemodynamic collapse define one follow condition : SBP &lt; 90 mmHg necessitate catecholamine administration ; mechanical ventilation ; cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Secondary outcomes interest all-cause mortality 30 day ; PE-related death 30 day ; confirm symptomatic PE recurrence ; duration hospitalization patient low intermediate-low risk compare patient intermediate-high risk . Recurrent PE confirm either presence new intraluminal filling defect , new perfusion scan defect involve &gt; 75 % lung segment . PE-related adverse event , recurrent PE all-cause mortality evaluate , participant center , physician involve study . Statistical analysis The three-level Bova score dichotomize ( low- intermediate-low-risk versus intermediate-high-risk ) . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis perform determine area curve ( AUC ) score ( absolute point ) regard study outcome . Prognostic performance score evaluate calculation sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) negative predictive value ( NPV ) , positive negative likelihood ratio . Sample size Based previous study sample size 500 patient adequate purpose study . After first 300 patient interim analysis perform precisely establish number patient need .</detailed_description>
