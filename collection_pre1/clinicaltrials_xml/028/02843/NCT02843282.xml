	<brief_title>Reasoning Training Individuals With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experiment undertaken understanding write consent subject . Participants include people fluent speaker English , standardize experimental cognitive test normed non-English speaker . Participants screen significant medical , neurological , psychiatric illness bipolar disorder . Additionally , two separate neuropsychological cognitive test two functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) imaging procedure conduct participant : one baseline prior cognitive training , second end cognitive training ( 4 week ) . These test procedure explain . Each participant receive appoint card/schedule appointment help keep track expect . During train program participant make 1 visit per week 2 hour 4-week period . Prior cognitive training , participant ' baseline gist detail processing ability , battery cognitive function neuropsychological measure obtain battery cognitive measure . Structural functional brain measure also obtain . All measurement take endpoint training . Training effect measure behaviorally train area ( reason &amp; physical ) untrained cognitive area . Additionally , structural functional brain imaging measure change cerebral blood flow , global regional brain volume , white matter tract , efficiency , activation pattern , blood oxygenation particular focus change frontal region . Screening Session : A research assistant conduct screening procedure phone include brief medical questionnaire cover history , current medication pre-existing condition . Prior diagnosis bipolar disorder euthymic state confirm participant 's psychiatrist treating physician . Given participant meet requirement cover phone screen , participant ask complete screening . Neurocognitive Testing Session : A clinician administer group standardize experimental test participant cognitive testing session . This session may last 3 hour , depend pace participant 's response time . The intent task ass high level think skill , work memory , selective learning . The test do Center BrainHealth 2200 W. Mockingbird Lane , Dallas , Texas . At cognitive test session , participant sign release form , clinicians fax release 'approval form ' physician . The neuropsychological cognitive test battery include test like Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( DKEFS ) Color-Word Interference Test , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( DKEFS ) Card Sorting Test , Test Strategic Learning ( TOSL ) , Auditory Selective Learning , Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS-III ) Logical Memory Subtest , Verbal Problem Solving , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( WAIS ) Similarities Subtest , Rey-Osterrieth Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) , Trails A , Trails B , Controlled Order Word Association Test ( COWAT ) , Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS-III ) Digits forward backwards , Framing task . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) : On separate day , participant fMRI , aforementioned time point study , lie scanner image brain record . Each session take 90 minute . During fMRI diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) patient ask lie still . Cognitive reason training : The gist-based reasoning training deliver one , two hour session week 4 week . Participants may also receive train individually online training session instead group set . It strategy-based rather content-based focus content specific situation-dependent . Gist-based reasoning link frontal lobe activation measure executive function . Potentially , learn strategy could apply across variety living context attend lecture , go movie , follow news story , plan carry project , understanding brochure outline change health care benefit , name . The strategy instruction hierarchical dynamically interdependent , strategy building upon previous strategy transform concrete meaning abstract gist-based meaning reason inference . Constructing mean high level abstraction promote learn efficient long last . The investigator use neurocognitive test fMRI ( explain ) 4-week period detect change participant ' brain and/ thinking process . Post Intervention : Following intervention , patient repeat cognitive neuropsychological assessment fMRI identical pre-training assessment . Participants pay test train session .</detailed_description>
