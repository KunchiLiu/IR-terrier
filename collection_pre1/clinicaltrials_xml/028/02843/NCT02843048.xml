	<brief_summary>Despite effective weight reduction severely obese patient , bariatric surgery ( BS ) negatively influence bone metabolism increase risk fall thereby potentially increase risk fracture . The mechanisms BS induce bone loss unknown may relate calcium vitamin D malabsorption , change energy regulation metabolism gastrointestinal hormonal physiology . Since etiology BS induce bone loss largely unknown , treatment relies mostly calcium vitamin D supplementation , provide little benefit . Exercise effective strategy prevent bone mass loss several health condition . However , study far examined effect exercise-training program prevention BS induce bone loss . The investigator main goal investigate effect bone metabolism fracture risk exercise-training program specifically tailor improve bone health balance patient underwent BS . The investigator perform randomize controlled trial obese patient ( n=80 ; BMI &gt; 40 Kg.m-2 ) elect BS . Patients randomly assign 2 group ) group receive standard follow-up medical care , ii ) group undergo 11 month ' Exercise Training program design improve bone health reduce fall risk plus standard follow-up medical care . All patient assess ) surgery , ii ) one month , iii ) 6 month , iv ) 12 month surgery . Assessments include : biochemical marker bone turnover ( BTM ) , BMD , bone tissue biomechanical property , hormone involve regulation energy , gastrointestinal bone metabolism , body composition , BMI , nutritional intake , balance , muscle strength , cardiorespiratory fitness daily physical activity . These evaluation allow investigator understand effect exercise-training program bone metabolism BS patient , contribute also elucidate mechanism underlie BS induce bone loss fracture risk increase . The investigator use establish method literature well novel procedure , enable overcome limitation previous study . At end study investigator expect collect consistent data whether exercise-training program able effectively prevent BS induce bone loss fracture risk increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator main goal determine Exercise-Training Intervention program ( ETI ) tailor improve bone health , strength balance , effective prevent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) induce fracture risk . To achieve investigator perform randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) volunteer obese patient ( BMI &gt; 35 Kg.m-2 ) undergo RYGB follow 13-months ( Figure 1 ) . The patient recruit , operate receive follow-up medical care Department General Surgery Centro Hospitalar de São João E.P.E ( DSHSJ ) . After elect RYGB inclusion exclusion criterion meet , patient decide join study randomly assign either ) participate 11 month duration ETI tailor improve bone health reduce fall risk addition standard follow-up medical care ( MFU ) ( ETI+MFU group ) , ii ) receive MFU ( control group ) . Recruiting patient one institution increase likelihood patient receive surgical MFU care , reduce bias relate use different clinical protocol . The option include RYGB also reduce bias associate surgical technique . Participants allocate ETI+MFU group undergo exercise-training program 11 month duration , 3 sessions/week , 60 minutes/session , start one month surgery . Each exercise session supervise include 5 major component : ) warm-up , ii ) multidirectional jump , iii ) balance , iv ) strength , v ) cool . This structure plan meet two main objective : ) enhance bone formation , ii ) reduce fall risk improve muscle strength , cardiorespiratory fitness balance . The ETI last almost 1 year effect BS bone metabolism show great first postoperative year ( 1 ) . As investigator main objective understand , broad perspective , possible therapeutic benefit ETI BS patient bone health fracture risk , plan investigate several variable study ( bone turnover marker , bone mineral content ( BMC ) density ( BMD ) , body composition , body mass index ( BMI ) , nutritional intake , static balance , dynamic balance , muscle strength lower limbs trunk , daily physical activity , cardiorespiratory fitness , bone derive hormone , hormone involve phosphate calcium metabolism , adipokines , gastrointestinal energy-metabolism hormone gonadal hormone ) . These enable investigator comprehensively understand metabolic change follow BS might affect bone health , exercise influence change potentially prevent fracture risk increase . Each patient assess 4 time study ( Figure 1 ) . Each assay match monitoring protocol already schedule DSHSJ patient undergo BS . The 1st evaluation occur prior BS , gather pre-surgical state . The 2nd , 3rd 4th evaluation occur 1st ( begin exercise-training program patient allocate exercise intervention group ) , 6th 12th month bariatric surgery , respectively . The variable analyze time point fit four major category : ) bone quality surrogate ( BTM , BMD , bone biomechanical property ) ; ii ) anthropometry ( weight , height , body composition , nutritional intake ; iii ) fall risk ( static dynamic balance , muscle strength , cardiorespiratory fitness , daily physical activity ) , iv ) hormones involved calcium , bone gastro-intestinal metabolism . Biochemical analysis perform blood sample collect follow hospital visit . Biochemical marker bone turnover ( BTM ) reflect degree bone remodel balance formation resorption therefore surrogates fracture risk . As BS profoundly affect body composition , gastrointestinal energy-regulation physiology , adipose tissue gut-associated hormone also influence bone metabolism , investigator determine hormone affect RYGB exercise . By monitor variable investigator gain insight etiological mechanism associate BS induce bone loss therapeutic effect exercise . BS also lead reduction calcium vitamin D absorption , may result increase bone resorption . The investigator therefore also monitor Vitamin D , Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) , calcium phosphorous concentration determine influence ETI . Despite mechanical unload due weight loss may contribute bone loss follow BS , data support mechanism . To investigate relation , investigator also monitor serum sclerostin , protein release osteocyte response mechanical unload negatively regulate bone formation . To determine effect BS exercise skeletal muscle adipose tissue mass , investigator measure body composition BMI patient . As one investigator main goal investigate effect ETI fall risk , also plan determine cardiorespiratory fitness muscle strength patient since variable previously show influence fall risk . Daily physical activity nutritional intake also determine accelerometer food diary , respectively , order control confound variable . Despite several caveat associate determination BMD DXA , investigator plan analyze variable , provide data enable compare result result previous study . Nevertheless , investigator plan complement information direct assessment bone biomechanical property , recently available vitro study due invasive nature procedure . Bone micro-indentation newer technique allow measure bone tissue mechanical property clinical setting , reflect high accuracy bone resistance fracture ( 6 ) . One main outcome research investigate effect BS fall risk , almost data issue . This accomplished direct determination static dynamic balance mean use force platform . By analyze broad set parameter investigator plan contribute thorough understanding effect BS bone metabolism , importantly , exercise training program , specifically tailor improve bone health balance , reduce risk bone fracture patient . Only analyze broad number parameter investigator able control several confound variable gain deep insight effect BS exercise bone metabolism patient , thereby contribute potently useful strategy management skeletal health BS patient .</detailed_description>
