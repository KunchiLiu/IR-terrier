	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle large organ human body many important role determine physical ability overall wellbeing . One major function skeletal muscle carry many daily task , rise chair get bus , task often refer functional ability . During healthy age muscle size reduce approximately 0.5-2 % year ( know sarcopenia ) , concurrent reduction functional ability . This result reduction quality life loss independence , clearly desirable . The incidence sarcopenia around 20 % 50-70 year around 50 % 80 year , absolute number average age population rise . One method muscle function enhance retard progression sarcopenia , across age group , exercise . The effectiveness exercise depend number genetic environmental factor , nutritional intake one important easily alter . Recent research suggest alter type fatty acid consume may positive effect muscle function . Little research yet carry elderly human . This important finding animal model definitively transferrable human . The main aim current proposal , therefore , investigate effect consumption eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid find oily fish , response resistance training programme elderly . A aim determine mechanism result adaptive response . The project centre round large 18 week resistance training/nutritional ( EPA/DHA ) intervention male females age 65 year . There three main research question experiment stem intervention . 1 ) Does consumption EPA DHA result great increase strength , power functional ability response resistance training ? To answer question series measure muscular performance functional ability assess . 2 ) Does consumption EPA DHA increase size quality muscle , reduce amount fat find within muscle decrease inflammation ? To address question participant MRI image muscle blood sample take intervention . This allow calculation muscle mass/fat content circulating level inflammatory marker . 3 ) Does consumption EPA DHA enhance activity molecule involve control muscle mass single bout resistance exercise ? For question muscle sample obtain single training session measure change molecule previously identify important change muscle mass response exercise . A fourth aim run throughout proposal 4 ) Do male females respond differently combination EPA/DHA resistance exercise ? Differences protein metabolism previously note gender yet investigation difference often overlook . The investigator investigate study response group male female . In summary , aim propose project test hypothesis consumption fatty acid find oily fish improve response elderly population resistance training intervention . The major outcome proposal would establish beneficial effect fish oil muscular adaptation elderly , open widely available therapeutic strategy improvement quality life elderly population . Such strategy particular importance due increase age UK population .</brief_summary>
