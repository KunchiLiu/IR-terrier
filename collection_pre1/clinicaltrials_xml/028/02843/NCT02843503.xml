	<brief_summary>Primary objective assess impact different reference glucose measurement method measure performance CGM system , aim standardization assessment CGM system . Secondary objective describe relationship glucose concentration venous , capillary arterialized-venous measurement sample . Study design : Open-label trial . Study population : Nineteen patient type 1 diabetes age 18 year old include . Intervention : The study use Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM . The participant visit clinical research center ( CRC ) twice 6 day period . These visit duration 8 hour . Blood drawn determination glucose concentration use venous , arterialized-venous capillary sampling technique . The patient receive usual breakfast increase insulin bolus administer correct breakfast glucose excursion aim induce period minor hypoglycemia . Blood sample continue end admission . The sensor worn end second 8-hour CRC session , plan day 6 early depend patient preference . The sensor remove sensor blood glucose meter data download device . In case sensor failure first CRC session , patient instruct insert new sensor per manufacturer 's instruction notify study staff event . In case failure sensor first CRC session second CRC session , patient return CRC sensor removal data download .</brief_summary>
