	<brief_title>Monitoring Anti-angiogenic Therapy Brain Tumors Advanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Imaging Study , investigator examine advanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) spectroscopy ( MRS ) able predict outcome participant brain tumor ( glioblastoma ) treat anti-angiogenic treatment call Avastin ( Avastin trade name bevacizumab ) . MRI study tumor size physical aspect tumor MRS add additional analysis measure chemical change tumor undergoes . This study aim test whether addition MRS standard MRI test help well predict tumor respond therapy . The name study intervention involve study : - MRI/MRS - Avastin Avastin work interfere process new blood vessel growth thus anti-angiogenic . Avastin approve U.S. Food Drug Administration use Glioblastoma . The participant 's treat physician may complement Avastin treatment chemotherapy include Temozolomide ( TMZ ) Lomustine ( CCNU ) . Both treatment approve U.S. Food Drug Administration use Glioblastoma . The purpose study predict treatment response anti-angiogenic therapy brain tumor participant use advanced MRI MRS. MRI/MRS FDA-approved test use magnet take picture brain let u `` see inside '' body/brain without surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm glioblastoma evidence recurrence . Patients lowgrade tumor progress glioblastoma eligible . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm . Patients must antiangiogenic therapy naïve . Age ≥18 year . We exclude child chance recruit child recurrent glioblastoma treat bevacizumab small . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Life expectancy great 10 week . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Participants must able undergo MRI scan . Participants whose clinical care plan include treatment bevacizumab monotherapy ( Group I ) bevacizumab ( + cytotoxic agent Temozolomide ( TMZ ) Lomustine ( CCNU ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants already receive antiVEGF investigational antiangiogenic therapy glioblastoma . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study effect MR image fetus unknown gadoliniumbased intravenous contrast material recommend use pregnant patient HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction bevacizumab , Temozolomide ( TMZ ) Lomustine ( CCNU ) . Patients suitable undergo MRI use gadolinium contrast due : Claustrophobia Presence metallic object implant medical device body ( i.e . cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , tattoo near eye , steel implant ) Sickle cell disease Renal failure Reduced renal function , determine creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min base serum creatinine level obtain within 28 day prior registration</criteria>
