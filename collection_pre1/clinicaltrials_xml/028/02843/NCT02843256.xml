	<brief_summary>Carbon-12 carbon-13 naturally-occurring isotope find exhale breath . Investigators prove 13CO2/12CO2 breath delta value ( BDV ) change subject negative energy balance feed positive energy balance meal . Measuring one liter exhale breath daily may convenient way measure negative positive energy balance patient receive intravenous nutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Exhaled Air Determine Changes Nutritional Status Patients Intravenous Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , pilot study determine change 12C/13C BDV day 0-7 patient receive parenteral nutrition . Investigators recruit subject inpatient unit University Wisconsin Hospital Clinics whose primary team consult Nutrition Support Team institute parenteral nutrition clinical reason . Subjects clinical indication parenteral nutrition moderately severely malnourish due little nutrition mean ( oral nutrition nutrition per tube ) period time ( 0-10 day base state nourishment prior admission ) . Investigators record baseline nutritional status medical record note ( dietitian , Nutrition Support Team , etc . ) , well medication , demographic information medical history . Investigators take baseline exhale CO2 measurement daily measurement approximately time daily ( +/- hour ) . The daily exhale 12C/13C breath delta value match subject ' daily caloric intake parenteral nutrition ( oral nutrition nutrition per tube , applicable ) . The breath delta value , caloric intake , plus subject ' degree malnourishment parameter build research . Investigators hypothesize breath delta value increase baseline stabilize patient reach goal energy need define Nutrition Support Team .</detailed_description>
