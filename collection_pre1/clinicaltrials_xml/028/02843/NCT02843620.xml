	<detailed_description>Previous study show efficacy intake native collagen relieve pain healthy patient joint discomfort . Native collagen detect gut 's Peyer 's patch , thanks mechanism know oral tolerisation , reduce autoimmune attack joint ' collagen improve joint function pain . Oral tolerance consist two phase immune response : maintenance homeostasis suppression immune response mediate Ag-specific regulatory T cell . T-cells detect epitopes type-II collagen gut suppress immune response bodily type-II collagen . Then , regulatory T cell generate gut presume migrate local microenvironment protein analogous orally dose antigen resides , case type-II collagen . Upon reactivation new microenvironment , regulatory cell suppress ongoing inflammation .</detailed_description>
