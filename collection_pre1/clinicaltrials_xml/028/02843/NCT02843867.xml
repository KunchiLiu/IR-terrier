	<brief_summary>The incidence atherosclerotic complication increase kidney transplantation . Traditional risk factor fully explain increased risk . Atherosclerosis inflammatory disease player immune response involve . The impact immune response well know immunocompromised patient , particularly among organ transplant . Nevertheless , work group suggest innate acquire response different mechanism influence evolution atheromatous disease transplantation . The investigator therefore propose study impact expansion regulatory T cell risk atherosclerotic complication transplantation . Since November 2008 , investigator begin multicenter , prospective study whose purpose study detail immunological mechanism atherosclerosis transplantation via immunomonitoring cohort renal transplant patient Grand East Interregion . It plan include 500 patient date little half include . After completion blood test , tubes rout Biomonitoring Platform ( CIC-BT 506 Besançon ) sample store CRB Dijon . The atherosclerotic event record prospectively . The investigator hope implement part ORLY IS , second study determine impact expansion regulatory T cell risk atherosclerotic event . Our hypothesis cell rate regulatory T median result increase 5 % atherosclerotic complication .</brief_summary>
