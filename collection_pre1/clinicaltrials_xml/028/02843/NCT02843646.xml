	<brief_title>Investigating Use WalkAide Child 's Ability Ascend/Descend Stairs Curbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator examine use WalkAide , Neuroprosthetic device , child 's ability ascend/descend stair curb . It hypothesize WalkAide use , improve ankle control achieve , affect speed , symmetry , independence complete task . Study subject fit WalkAide Physical Therapists train procedure . Subjects build tolerance device two-week period , use able next six week . The child ( participants/subjects ) study go desensitization process familiarize electrical stimulation . The child begin stimulation , wear Walkaide introduce sensation cuff leg prior begin stimulation . Once familiar feel Walkaide , electrical stimulation introduce slowly gradually . The child 's face verbal response monitor stimulation introduce turn desired response threshold . An age cognitively appropriate pain scale available applicable child situation . The child assure want continue feel uncomfortable , electrical stimulation turn immediately . The minimum stimulus intensity determine collaboration subject . The child ask identify first begin feel stimulus , number intensity knob note . The duration stimulus gradually increase along wear Walkaide . Subjects begin wear prosthesis 30 minute . The wearing time increase waking hour subject , depend age . The electrode place client session begin , take immediately WalkAide usage . The skin check WalkAide electrode usage . The skin clean alcohol wipe electrode apply . It normal observe somewhat reddened area electrode placement follow usage . However , redness disappear within hour . With sign irradiation maintain redness , small pimple like lesion blister , WalkAide usage discontinue time , patient bring medical staff . The skin re-evaluated hour later follow electrode usage . The Pediatrician patient immediately notify , WalkAide usage discontinue problem resolve .</detailed_description>
