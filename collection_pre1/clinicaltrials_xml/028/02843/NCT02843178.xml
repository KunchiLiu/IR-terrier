	<brief_summary>Improving diet increase food vegetable ( F &amp; V ) consumption significantly reduce risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Programs increase accessibility affordability F &amp; Vs among low-income Americans hinder food consumption cycle associate poverty : tendency over-consume calorie shortly receive fund begin month , drain budget F &amp; V purchase , food purchase , month 's end . An emerge theory dietary behavior suggest provide fund food small installment distribute throughout month smooth consumption cycle improve healthy eating—counteracting tendency respond lump sum , once-monthly funding installment purchase calorie-dense food immediately fund receive . The theory also suggest fund target toward specific healthy food ( e.g. , F &amp; Vs ) improve diet untargeted fund , despite inconvenience utilizing target fund . We rigorously test hypothesis real-world set compare alternative approach deliver food purchasing voucher . We establish tested infrastructure provide voucher accept numerous food seller ( e.g. , supermarket , corner shop ) low-income neighborhood . Leveraging infrastructure , conduct randomize trial two-by-two factorial design , compare $ 20 voucher valid one month four $ 5 voucher valid sequential week month ( lump sum versus distribute funding ) , compare voucher restrict F &amp; V purchase voucher redeemable food ( target versus untargeted funding ) . Low-income adult ( N=288 ) recruit community partner randomize one four 6-month intervention : monthly target , monthly untargeted , weekly target , weekly untargeted voucher . Participants assess efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recall validate among low-literacy population , determine daily consumption F &amp; Vs metric overall dietary quality month 0 , 6 12 ( 6 month voucher end ) . Additional survey identify moderator mediator dietary improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Designing Food Voucher Programs Reduce Disparities Healthy Diets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants trial recruit via advertisement community sit include primary care clinic , housing assistance site , soup kitchen city San Francisco . Recruitment material direct interested individual attend one study information session 'storefront ' site San Francisco initial screen evaluation study staff , study orientation session detail study purpose , procedure , participant right . The orientation session consist 60-minute session centrally-located room . After orientation session , participant invite sign consent form , complete baseline assessment , randomize one four intervention condition 1:1:1:1 allocation . We use permuted block randomization sample size intervention group nearly equal . Allocation sequence conceal prior assignment ; staff sequence generation , allocation concealment , implementation separate . Those agree participate sign write consent form study orientation randomize one four voucher condition , part 2-by-2 study design : ( 1 ) voucher target fruit vegetable valid sequential week month ; ( 2 ) voucher target fruit vegetable valid entire month ; ( 3 ) voucher applicable food valid sequential week month ; ( 4 ) voucher applicable food valid entire month . Half participant receive blue voucher valid food ( tobacco , alcohol , prepared food ) , half receive green voucher valid qualify fruit vegetable ( fresh frozen fruit , vegetable , herb without added sugar fat , correspond eligibility guideline exist voucher program ) . All voucher individual value ( $ 5 ) , one half participant receive four voucher valid whole month ( lump sum payment $ 20 ) , half receive four voucher valid one sequential week month , label voucher ( distributed payment $ 5 per week ) . Therefore , intervention group balance time attention study staff , well effort obtain voucher . By voucher small increment $ 5 , minimize need large voucher spent , reduce risk food spoilage affect intervention effectiveness . Having voucher worth value also simplify process voucher level food vendor . We specifically design monetary amount trial sufficient achieve nutritional goal ( Healthy People 2020 goal consume 1.4 cup fruit vegetable per day ) , unduly large coercive low-income population . One month 's supply voucher picked-up participant first week month . Therefore , intervention group balance time attention study staff , well effort obtain voucher . Vouchers pick participant multiple neighborhood community-based location . The location food pantry , area public health clinic neighbor-hood public housing project office serve recruitment distribution site pilot feasibility study , serve recruitment sit trial . The site open extend business hour . Vouchers place small seal envelope lockbox front desk location ; participant identification number appear envelope . Voucher distributor access lockbox combination , login secure HIPAA-compliant Access database record participant pick voucher . Picture identification require pick-up , participant sign pick-up sheet . Participants without picture ID refer city hall office provide free city-sponsored picture ID . Participants must pick voucher , lose voucher replace . To redeem voucher , participant present voucher cashier , sign date voucher time redemption . The cashier process voucher process voucher Women , Infants Children 's program manufacturer 's coupon , vendor submits redeem voucher payment ( financial infrastructure handle San Francisco General Hospital Foundation ) . The names vendor accept voucher print voucher , along address business hour . All voucher rule review participant orientation session . We continue routine meeting neighborhood food vendor ' manager ensure continue active participation correct usage voucher . Following informed consent , participant complete baseline survey 24-hour dietary recall randomize one four study condition . The recall include three distinct pass obtain participant 's food intake previous 24 hours—a quick list , detailed description , review—including food obtain home away home , include barter , forage , food pantry non-purchased item . Participants provide standard 2-dimensional booklet reference portion size . Our research assistant blind participant 's intervention arm skilled guide dietary recall among diverse participant non-judgmental , comprehensive manner . The baseline recall conduct person storefront site ; subsequent recall conduct telephone . Recalls perform week 1 week 4 month-0 ( baseline ) , month-6 , month-12 assessment . Two recall do week 1 ( one weekday one weekend ) two week 4 ( one weekday one weekend ) assessment month . This minimize number recall required capture intra-person variation diet weekday weekend , simultaneously capture monthly consumption cycle among participant ( key hypothesize mediator lump sum vs. distribute voucher effect ) . In addition dietary recall , research assistant orally administer survey prevent literacy-based bias , consistent recent Institute Medicine recommendation . These 20-minute survey conduct month 0 , 6 , 12 cover attitude preference regard voucher fruit vegetable generally , shop pattern , food expenditure , household environment , food insecurity . Each participant receive voucher total 6 month . The participant track recruitment/retention coordinator brief telephone contact monthly ensure retention complete month 12 survey dietary recall ( 6 month end intervention ) , discharge study . In addition participant receive voucher , also conduct brief survey manager ten store sign memo understand City San Francisco San Francisco General Foundation accept voucher . The manager give informed consent form consider participate post- intervention survey . The paper-based vendor survey hand-delivered vendor ' manager ass : ( ) whether manager difficulty voucher system whether difficulty point sale , point reimbursement , and/or answer question customer voucher ; ( ii ) activity use vendor promote fruit vegetable purchase voucher trial period ; ( iii ) activity engage sell fruit vegetable ; ( iv ) free text entry elicit change vendor would propose voucher system future</detailed_description>
