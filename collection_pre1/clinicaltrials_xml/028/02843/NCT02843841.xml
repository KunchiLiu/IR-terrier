	<brief_summary>The prevention allograft rejection kidney transplantation require administer patient immunosuppressive regimen induction . The induction strategy base injection polyclonal anti-lymphocyte globulin ( ATG-FLAG fresenius® ) drive lymphocyte lysis , injection monoclonal antibody direct non-lymphopenic α chain IL-receptor 2 ( anti-CD25 antibody , basiliximab ) , immunological risk patient . Our group show significant increase death rate transplant patient lymphopenia CD4 continue beyond 2 year transplantation . This excess mortality relate complication follow chronic inflammation observe patient lymphopenic . Preliminary study show induced lymphodéplétion ATG appear accompanied increase bacterial product blood transplant since significant increase sCD14 observe patient one year . We also observe increased concentration LPS patient ATG group . This could indicate secondary bacterial intestinal translocation weaken intestinal immunity link ATG . The main objective study assess impact anti-lymphocyte globulin polyclonal intestinal permeability , estimate rate lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , constituent cell wall Gram-negative bacteria ) blood kidney transplantation . The secondary objective evaluate bacterial translocation , effect bacterial translocation structural metabolic function intestinal epithelium , chronic inflammation , immune reconstitution , regeneration , activation proliferation T lymphocytes , polymorphism LPS receptor cause activation innate immunity composition intestinal microbiota . The study population consist renal transplant patient Nephrology University Hospital Besancon . Patients divide 2 group accord induction immunosuppressive therapy prescribe day renal transplantation part usual care , ie treatment anti-lymphocyte globulin polyclonal ( ATG-Fresenius® ) antibody treatment monoclonal anti-CD25 ( basiliximab Simulect ) . The patient group treat anti-CD25 antibody serve control group ( depletion immune system ) group patient treat ATG .</brief_summary>
