In planned trial plan enroll 70 subject , i.e . 50 subject neovascular AMD 20 healthy volunteer . The investigator evaluate change Baseline ( Visit 1 ) BCVA score Week 12 ( visit 4 ) study eye nAMD patient treat Ranibizumab . Neovascular AMD patient ( group 1 ) accompany 6 month blood sample collect baseline monthly Visit 7 analysis antibody profile .

	<detailed_description>Several study last year report involvement anti-retinal autoantibody ocular disorder , retinal vasculitis , retinopathy , retinitis pigmentosa also AMD . These study support grow evidence immunological involvement pathogenesis AMD . In planned trial plan enroll 70 subject , i.e . 50 subject neovascular AMD 20 healthy volunteer . The investigator evaluate change Baseline ( Visit 1 ) BCVA score Week 12 ( visit 4 ) study eye nAMD patient treat Ranibizumab . AMD patient healthy volunteer recruit Department Ophthalmology University Medical Center , Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz include base define criterion . Neovascular AMD patient ( group 1 ) accompany 6 month blood sample collect baseline monthly Visit 7 analysis antibody profile . Ranibizumab apply accord manufacturer 's recommendation `` Stellungnahme der DOG , RG und BVA zu aktuellen therapeutischen Möglichkeiten bei der neovaskulären AMD '' ( December 2012 ) . A loading dose three injection within first three month follow individual therapy interval base clinical progress ( PRN ) . Re-treatment upload three initial dos every 4 week perform case progression ( PRN ) base recommendation `` Stellungnahme der DOG , RG und BVA zu aktuellen therapeutischen Möglichkeiten bei der neovasculären AMD '' ( December 2012 ) . Healthy volunteer ( group 2 ) enrol blood sample collect analysis antibody profile . Beside analysis primary endpoint , investigator propose analyze detail follow question : Does ranibizumab treatment effect antibody profile find serum change correlate clinical course disease ? Additionally , patient group divide two subgroup : AMD patient newly diagnose neovascular AMD , receive anti-VEGF-treatment far ( naïve subject ) AMD patient neovascular AMD , receive anti-VEGF treatment 3 month prior inclusion study . This separation may help answer question possible differentiate ranibizumab responder non-responder help antibody profile .</detailed_description>
