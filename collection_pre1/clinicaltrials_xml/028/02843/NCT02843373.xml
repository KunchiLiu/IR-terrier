	<brief_summary>The overarch goal research program elucidate causal directional neural network- level abnormality depression , modulate individually-tailored , circuit-directed intervention . By use concurrent TMS EEG , investigator overcome major limitation EEG - inability demonstrate causality . Here , plan recruit patient medication-resistant depression undergo rTMS treatment . At multiple time point , perform TMS-EEG investigate excitability connectivity profile brain network modulate treatment . This study aim provide objective brain network measure predict track clinical response TMS treatment . Findings study utilized develop novel , personalize treatment protocol base individual brain network .</brief_summary>
