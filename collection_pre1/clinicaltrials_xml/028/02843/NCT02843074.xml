	<brief_title>Elotuzumab , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone ( ERd ) Induction , Consolidation Maintenance Treatment Transplant-Eligible , Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study evaluate feasibility use combination elotuzumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( ERd ) induction therapy ability combination facilitate start autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) transplant-eligible patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . In addition induction , efficacy , safety , tolerability ERd consolidation maintenance therapy patient observe . Eligible patient undergo four 28-day cycle induction regimen elotuzumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . Following completion 4 cycle induction therapy , patient undergo standard mobilization , collection stem cell , ASCT use melphalan condition regimen per institutional guideline . Toxicity evaluation interrupt stem cell procedure resume onset consolidation . Adverse event collect , however , end induction mobilization . Consolidation therapy begin 70 120 day follow ASCT consist four 28-day cycle elotuzumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . All patient experience progressive disease begin maintenance therapy elotuzumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . The duration maintenance 24 month .</detailed_description>
