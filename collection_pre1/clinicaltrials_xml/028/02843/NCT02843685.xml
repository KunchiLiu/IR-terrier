	<detailed_description>Many health care intervention medication find benefit ( `` efficacy '' ) experimental , tightly-controlled , human research trial later find lack real-world health benefit ( `` effectiveness '' ) . Inadequate surveillance real-world clinical effectiveness may falsely reassure clinician monitor healthcare quality , propagate unrecognized ineffective harmful treatment high cost patient society . The failure translate potential health benefit realize gain , detect unexpected harm healthcare delivery , stem lack method robustly measure real-world ( ) effectiveness . Current method detect change outcomes 'before ' implementation may bias secular trend healthcare practice outcome ; method compare outcomes treat untreated patient may bias unmeasured factor . The current project aim develop demonstrate - proof-of-concept - use quasi-experimental research method call 'regression discontinuity design ( RDD ) ' surveillance real-world clinical effectiveness . RDD previously find use evaluation educational program student score threshold assign intervention . The US Department Education consider RDD design quality similar randomize trial . However , RDD rigorously evaluate context evaluate clinical effectiveness . RDD use whenever intervention give patient score threshold continuous biomarker risk score . This scenario often arise clinical practice , threshold use identify treat 'high risk ' patient . In RDD , outcomes compare patient threshold , similar , receive different treatment . The project study use RDD evaluate real-world effectiveness drotrecogin alpha , medication recommend FDA give critically ill patient severe sepsis high risk mortality ( APACHE score &gt; 25 ) . Drotrecogin alpha show potentially `` effectiveness '' use traditional method real-world research , eventually show clinically efficacious subsequent large randomize trial . The present proposal 'proof-of-concept ' study allow evaluation effect estimate derive RDD method gold standard , pool randomize trial result . The demonstration feasibility new research method , RDD , evaluate real-world clinical effectiveness would major leap forward ability monitor potential real world benefit harm new treatment .</detailed_description>
