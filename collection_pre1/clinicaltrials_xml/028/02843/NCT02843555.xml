	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1. define novel homogeneous group patient LDs 2. work toward find cause disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Leukodystrophies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients leukodystrophies ( LDs ) unknown etiology heterogeneous group constitute second large group genetic white matter disease . In order find cause leukodystrophies , patient LDs unknown cause analyze clinically , neurophysiologically , biochemically genetically . Patients would diagnose know leukodystrophies outside center . At Baylor University Medical Center , patient undergo series neuropsychological , blood , urine , spinal fluid , radiological , peripheral tissue pathological test . Some test part standard battery others tailor individual patient . Patients follow yearly necessary . Patients screen mutation gene cod structural myelin protein . In patient test yield information regard etiology disease , evidence suggest involvement peripheral nervous system , sural nerve biopsy consider . Sural nerve biopsy tissue evaluate use novel combination approach include detailed pathological , immunohistochemical , biochemical analysis myelin proteins lipid . Schwann cell biology expression myelin gene brain also investigate situ . It hop present study help clarify nosology leukodystrophies significantly advance understanding pathogenesis disease .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must : clinical radiographic sign leukodystrophy without specific etiology diagnosis adrenoleukodystrophy , adrenomyeloneuropathy , metachromatic leukodystrophy , Krabbe disease , Canavan disease , welldefined amino acid organic acid disorder , systemic mitochondrial cytopathy . Firstdegree relatives patient leukodystrophies unknown etiology ( father , mother , sibling , son daughter patient ) Be able travel Baylor University Medical Center Dallas Texas evaluation spend 58 work day site Be able tolerate general exam neurological exam Be able tolerate modest amount blood drawing , provide urine specimen , skin biopsy ( previously do ) Be able tolerate performance necessary neuroimaging study include EEG Head MRI Be able tolerate neuropsychological test rehabilitation evaluation Be able tolerate spinal tap nerve biopsy need Unable travel Baylor University Medical Center Dallas Texas evaluation Refusal sign study consent form Unable tolerate performance require test</criteria>
