	<brief_summary>The propose study design evaluate performance ALTOIDA™ System tool assist physician diagnose Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) real-world clinical setting . The design study guide two override factor : 1 ) optimize performance ALTOIDA™ neuromotor classifier , subject make train set must well characterize clinical diagnosis , 2 ) ALTOIDA™ test must perform reproduced real-world clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study determine relationship among clinical , cognitive , image , genetic , biochemical biomarker characteristic stage AD spectrum precedes MCI , mild symptomatic phase AD , refer EMCI . The ADNI-GO model posit AD begin amyloid β ( Aβ ) deposition cortex , lead synaptic dysfunction , neurodegeneration , cognitive/ functional decline . Some leading-edge technology study brain-imaging technique , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , include FDG-PET ( measure glucose metabolism brain ) ; PET use radioactive compound ( F-AV-45 ) measure brain beta-amyloid ; structural MRI . Brain scan show scientist brain 's structure function change AD start progress . Biomarkers cerebrospinal fluid revealing change could identify patient MCI develop Alzheimer 's . Scientists look level beta-amyloid tau cerebrospinal fluid . ( Abnormal amount amyloid tau protein brain hallmarks Alzheimer 's disease . ) The aim study evaluate performance ALTOIDA™ System tool assist physician diagnose Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) real-world clinical setting . The study : A. Multi-Center Study : primary goal study evaluate ALTOIDA™ Platform across multiple study location . This demonstrate ability perform test , collect data , generate classification irrespective variation test location personnel . 7-8 study site select site recognize NIH Center Excellence Alzheimer 's disease nationally recognize Alzheimer 's disease research center . Each site evaluate 60 subject evenly divide AD patient age-matched control ( prevalence AD approximately 12 % general population , ratio AD normal among visit clinic memory cognitive related issue 50-60 % ) . Each site follow test protocol . All test data upload online ALTOIDA™ database server . B . The overall impact study increase knowledge concern sequence timing event lead MCI AD , development well clinical neuromotor biomarker method early detection monitor progression condition , facilitation clinical trial treatment slow disease progression , ultimately contribute prevention AD .</detailed_description>
