	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) combine checkpoint blockade immunotherapy ( CBI ) improve response anticancer treatment compare CBI alone patient advance metastatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy Combined With Stereotactic Body Radiation Advanced Metastatic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy least 1 site measurable metastatic disease irradiate candidate study . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) CBI combine SBRT CBI alone . SBRT 9.5Gy x3 fraction deliver within 1-21 day start first cycle CBI . The first six patient treat observed toxicity safety run-in phase 30 day radiation continue accrual . Radiation dose reduction allow necessary meet tissue constraint ( 6Gyx3 Minimum Dose ) . Response rate determine non-irradiated lesion/lesions . Blood draw obtain analyze anti-tumor immune response .</detailed_description>
