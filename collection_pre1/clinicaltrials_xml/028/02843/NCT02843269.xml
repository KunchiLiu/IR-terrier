	<brief_summary>Several RCT study aim reduce either musculoskeletal disorder , sickness presenteeism , sickness absenteeism combination among female high physical work demand . These study provide evidence workplace health promotion ( WHP ) intervention effective , long-term effect still uncertain . These study either lack succeed maintain intervention effect lack document effect maintain past one-year period . FRIDOM ( FRamed Intervention Decrease Occupational Muscle pain ) WHP program among health care worker . A job group characterize high physical work demand , musculoskeletal disorder , high sickness presenteeism - absenteeism . FRIDOM aim reduce neck shoulder pain secondary reduce sickness presenteeism sickness absenteeism . An secondary aim decrease lifestyle-diseases musculoskeletal disorder well metabolic- , cardiovascular disorder - maintain participation regular physical exercise training , one year intervention period . The entire concept tailor population female health care worker . This do multi-component intervention include 1 ) intelligent physical exercise training ( IPET ) , dietary advice weight loss ( DAW ) cognitive behavioural training ( CBT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The FRIDOM program compose four part : 1 ) A planning phase accord intervention mapping principle , 2 ) feasibility study reveal issue implementation intervention content , 3 ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) , 4 ) maintenance period . Below component detail . Intervention mapping time frame The main focus intervention sustainable behavioural life-style change , therefore , key point detail planning phase ease final maintenance introduce health enhance activity 12 month supervise intervention . The FRIDOM-Feasibility study To prepare facilitate FRIDOM-RCT study feasibility study conduct serve several purpose . Before intervention feasibility study initiate , eligible employee ask fill screen questionnaire participate baseline-screening-test . To allow subsequent adjustment intervention content mode practical implementation , feasibility study time ahead RCT study , accord principal schedule RCT . The FRIDOM-RCT study The FRIDOM-RCT implement cluster RCT `` step wedge '' design . Content intervention give repeatedly , important step avoid change intervention delivery successive cohort . The FRIDOM-Maintenance Besides primary secondary goal , long term goal implement intervention element permanent activity workplace , maintain beyond one-year intervention period . Therefore , activity offer workplace include baseline consenters , also gradually involve new employee employee return work . Study population The FRIDOM program offer entire elderly care section medium size municipality Jutland , Denmark . All eligible personnel entire elderly care section invite participate project optimize motivation comply intervention . Recruitment Procedure A necessary number meeting hold reach eligible participant . Prior meeting , write information distribute employee short information pamphlet . Managers supply employee , attend information meeting write information screen questionnaire . The FRIDOM-Feasibility study The feasibility study include health care worker , work center elderly people retirement home employee work elderly´s private home day , even night shift . The FRIDOM-RCT The RCT participant individually allocate team accord follow criterion minimize variation within team : 1 ) Geographical location workplace , 2 ) work center/home care facility elderlies private home , 3 ) day evening/night shift . To maximize motivation social bonding colleague within team , close relation colleague take consideration . In order minimize contamination cluster , priority give minimize variation geographical location within cluster . Intervention content The one-hour weekly multi-component intervention consist combination intelligent physical exercise training ( IPET ) include Power Breaks , dietary advice weight loss ( DAW ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . IPET The principle IPET exercise training adjust 1 ) occupational physical exposure , 2 ) physical capacity , 3 ) health status 4 ) motivation barrier . The physical exercise consist two element : strength training exercise elastic band resistance ( Power Breaks ) aerobic exercise . The aerobic exercise inspire protocol develop previously workplace study . DAW All participant guide ensure healthy diet prevent weight gain adjusting course accord Danish Dietary recommendation . For individual resting metabolism calculate , base gender , age weight multiplied Physical Activity Level factor 1.8 estimate daily energy requirement . ~1.000 calorie subtract estimate daily energy requirement result value use individual calorie prescription . CBT The CBT training develop previous research project Christensen . The CBT provide group discussion follow specifically tailor guideline , contain exercise pro-and-con scheme homework session . To support aim participant adherence workplace physical exercise regular leisure time physical exercise training , motivational initiative base upon Self-Determination Theory include . Instructors Due Danish legislation , employee entitle six week vacation . Thus , weekly training session carry 46 week supervise instructor . Outcome measure Outcome measure collect four different category : ( Category 1 ) data draw workplace registration , ( category 2 ) questionnaire , ( category 3 ) physiological test ( category 4 ) adherence . Besides physical test , physiological test include blood sample blood sucker , cholesterol triglyceride . Category 1-4 test collect participant , either FRIDOM-feasibility FRIDOM-RCT study . At time point , full package category collect ( Large test ) , time point , subset collect ( Mini test ) . Besides Large test Mini test , screen test initially conduct . Workplace registration ( 1 ) Information age , sex , job seniority , weekly working hour , work shift , care center home care , job type educational level gather workplace registration employee . Sickness absenteeism retrieve local database maintain executive director workplace . Questionnaire ( 2 ) The FRIDOM program consist three different questionnaire . 1 ) A Large questionnaire give baseline followed-up one year within RCT-cluster , 2 ) Mini questionnaire complete every third month , finally 3 ) Screening questionnaire distribute randomization . The Large questionnaire involve lifestyle behaviour health , dietary intake , physical activity leisure time , self-rated health Stress-Energy Scale , SF-36 , physical resource five item : aerobic fitness , strength , endurance , flexibility balance/coordination , readiness change , Cohens Perceived Stress Scale , chronic disease , Standardized Nordic Questionnaires musculoskeletal symptom last seven day pain intensity numeric rank box scale , general self-efficacy , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia , Work ability Scale , perceive physical exertion , productivity single item World Health Organization Health Work Performance Questionnaire ( HPQ ) Quantity Quality work . The Mini questionnaire every third month consist eight question , include Standardized Nordic Questionnaires analysis musculoskeletal symptom last seven day pain intensity , physical capacity , balance/coordination , readiness change general self-efficacy . The Screening questionnaire consist subset item Large questionnaire . The purpose evaluate reach intervention within RE-AIM framework . Pain measured Standardized Nordic Questionnaires analysis musculoskeletal symptoms last 12 month . Physiological test ( 3 ) The FRIDOM program include three different test-batteries . A large test-battery measure baseline one year , Mini test every third month Screening test randomization . All participant test Large test baseline one year intervention . The large test last one hour consist anthropometrical , health-related physical capacity measure height , body weight , body fat , waist circumference , blood pressure , aerobic fitness , isometric maximal voluntary strength hand , shoulder elevation , back flexion extension force . The Mini test last 15 minute include : blood pressure , body weight , BMI , body fat , waist circumference , balance test . The Screening test last 3 minute include information 's weight , BMI body fat . Adherence ( 4 ) Participation 46 weekly multi-component training offer workplace register instructor . Performance daily five minute exercise elastic band ( Power Breaks ) , color Thera band , number winding ( 1-3 ) report training diary . Additional measure nest subsample Diurnal measurement consist physical activity electrocardiogram perform random subset participant . Physical activity subsequently quantify time sit , stand walk use custom build software . Electrocardiogram estimation heart rate heart rate variability record use e-Patch data logger initialize gender age use commercial software Hasimed . During diurnal measurement , participant ask follow normal every-day schedule life note paper diary , work hour , sleep waking time , monitor remove schedule . Statistics Analysis outcome perform entire population health care target population . The primary outcome measure questionnaire base self-reported duration intensity neck pain outcome measure consider secondary outcome . For Feasibility study pre-post test analyze use pair t-test repeated measure . For RCT difference three cluster baseline test Pearson´s x² distribution sex , education , current smoking status dichotomize parameter musculoskeletal symptom neck , shoulder , upper- low back . All parameter test Student´s t-test . Changes 3 month intervention period compare change correspond 3 month control period ANCOVA analysis accordance intention-to-treat principle , i.e . randomized participant include analysis miss value substitute carry forward backwards measure variable . Clusters , age investigate value baseline include covariates . All result give mean ( SD ) . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . SPSS statistics 23 used statistical analysis . In order account combine effect within subject repeat measurement subject , linear mixed effect model use . Additionally , likelihood ratio test use compare model without covariance structure . Analyses base intention treat principle include eligible participant without imputation since mixed effect model inherently account miss value . Sample size RCT part estimate use method describe Woertman &amp; colleague sample size calculation . The study power detect between-groups mean difference primary endpoint 1 point pain intensity , consider relevant change workplace context term risk sickness absence . The variance set 2.0 base result Danish study within similar population , α 0.05 , power 0.8 , intra-cluster correlation coefficient 0.05 three step . The calculation show 82 participant total need dropout rate 50 % plan recruit least 160 participant .</detailed_description>
