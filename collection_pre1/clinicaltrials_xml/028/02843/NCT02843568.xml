	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop radiation plan help preserve lung function healthy tissue surround tumor . We believe 4DCT scan useful design radiation treatment plan help u avoid healthy normal function lung tissue close lung tumor . Currently 4DCT scan use help u determine exactly tumor move breathe . In study also use 4DCT scan try identify high function normal lung tissue .</brief_summary>
