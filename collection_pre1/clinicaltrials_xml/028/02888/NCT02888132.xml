	<brief_summary>Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ( HOCM ) patient significant clinical symptom , include progressively increase fatigue , angina , exertional dyspnea , syncope . Conservative medication use treat vast majority patient . Invasive therapy , include surgical myectomy , septal ethanol ablation dual-chamber pacing introduce patient refractory symptom drug resistance . Considering sternotomy relatively high patient ' tolerance require myectomy , potentially risky misplacement ethanol anatomic variability vascularise hypertrophic septum , potential risk conduction block two treatment , development new minimally invasive approach warrant . Previous research illustrate effectiveness feasibility transcatheter radio frequency ablation HOCM patient . By far , report transthoracic laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy ( LITT ) human treatment . Since 2004 , department adopt High Intensity Focused Ultrasound , radio frequency laser solid tumor treatment , include liver tumor fibroid . Also center conduct several animal experiment verify feasibility radio frequency/laser septal myocardium ablation . The purpose study lead echocardiography-guided transthoracic radio frequency/laser ablation HOCM ventricular septum , make minimally invasive treatment plan HOCM patient , verify safety validity intervention treatment long term .</brief_summary>
