	<brief_summary>Background : Fecal incontinence ( FI ) affect 2-13 % adult general population . The prevalence increase age , 50 year age prevalence rate 26 % woman report . Quality life patient FI decrease considerably , similar extent patient ulcerative colitis relapse . Management FI usually involve stepwise approach ; begin conservative strategy move appropriately tailor medication , bowel-retraining , biofeedback psychosocial support . Although combination treatment alternative often improve symptom always successfully . Neuromodulation relatively new treatment modality FI base recruitment residual anorectal neuromuscular function pertinent continence electrical stimulation peripheral nerve supply . Sacral Nerve Stimulation ( SNS ) one type neuromodulation employ direct electrical stimulation sacral nerve . Recently alternative neuromodulation technique SNS develop treat FI i.e . tibial nerve stimulation . The tibial nerve contains afferent efferent fiber originate forth fifth lumbar nerve first , second third sacral nerve . Thus , stimulation tibial nerve may lead change anorectal neuromuscular function similar observe SNS without need permanent surgically implanted device . Tibial nerve stimulation therefore attractive treatment alternative FI patient since treatment well-tolerated treatment result promise . Aim : The overall aim measure effect percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) combination biofeedback symptom consecutive FI patient compare biofeedback alone . The investigator also aim study FI patient profit addition PTNS . Methods : The study take place Pelvic Floor Unit , department Gastroenterology , University Hospital Linköping . Prior first visit hospital symptom diary mail FI patient instruct record FI symptom , bowel habit gastrointestinal symptom prospectively 24-hour diary 2 week . Before consideration enrolment study , gastroenterologist assess patient ' medical history perform physical examination . Subjects also endoanal ultrasonography investigator measure rectal volume , sensational threshold anal sphincter function . FI patient fulfil inclusion criterion randomly assign either PTNS combination biofeedback biofeedback alone . The treatment perform physiotherapist .</brief_summary>
