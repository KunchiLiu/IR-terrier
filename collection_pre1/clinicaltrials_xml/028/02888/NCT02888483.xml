	<detailed_description>Wearable activity monitor potential continuously objectively measure physical activity . However , exist monitor address unique challenge face old adult , comprise large segment population suffer physical disability dexterity issue make use monitor exceedingly difficult . In fact , majority wearable device market address need three broad segment : 1 . Consumers : device design optimized motivate , healthy young individual require pair smartphones transmit data , restricting , best , limit access raw data algorithm . 2 . Researchers : research-focused device tend validate across wide range study , optimize wearability longitudinal use . 3 . Developers : Developer-focused device typically provide high configurability , high- definition screen , variety sensor ( e.g . accelerometer , gyroscope , air pressure , light , temperature , etc . ) suit research development , optimize power-efficient use . To overcome barrier exist monitor impose measure free-living physical activity data , EveryFit develop in-home activity monitoring technology address specific unique need old population ( incorporated product call QMedic ) . The overall objective project evaluate validate accuracy usability deploy beta sensor-based system . The technology utilize novel power-efficient engineering continuously measure physical activity ( include intensity , type duration ) laboratory free-living setting . To accomplish objective enroll 100 adult 60+ year age perform standardize lifestyle , exercise sedentary type physical activity laboratory . A subset participant also ask wear monitor free-living setting . The proposed work far-reaching impact give growth older adult population , suffers disproportionally chronic disease functional impairment . Validating technology measure physical activity continuously accurately home critical step scale system , conduct affordable population- scale study , maximize societal impact innovation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 60+ year old Community dwelling adult without significant health issue would impact safety participation Willingness undergo test procedure Weight stable least three month Able understand speak English Failure provide inform consent Use walker ( use cane permit ) Lower extremity amputation Develops chest pain severe shortness breath physical stress Poststroke syndrome cause ambulatory deficit ( stroke survivor permit ) Needs assistance basic activity daily living : feeding , dress , continence , bathing , toileting , transfer bed chair chair walk Lives nurse home ; person live assisted independent housing exclude Heavy drink drink 5 drink occasion 5 day past 30 day . For woman childbearing age ( 62 year age ) : pregnancy breastfeed Participation structure weight loss program fad diet last month Weight reduction surgery past year Known neuromuscular disorder restrict activity ( e.g . Rhabdomyolysis , Myasthenia Gravis , Ataxia , Apraxia , postpolio syndrome , mitochondrial myopathy , etc . ) Diagnosed neuropathy cause pain restricts activity Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease restrict activity Unable communicate severe hearing loss speech disorder Severe visual impairment , would preclude completion assessment Progressive , degenerative neurologic disease ( e.g. , Parkinson 's Disease , Multiple Sclerosis , ALS ) Severe rheumatologic orthopedic diseases significantly restrict activity ( e.g. , await joint replacement , active inflammatory disease ) Terminal illness , determine physician Severe pulmonary disease , require use supplemental oxygen steroid therapy Severe cardiac disease , include NYHA Class III IV congestive heart failure , clinically significant aortic stenosis , recent history cardiac arrest , use cardiac defibrillator , uncontrolled angina Other significant comorbid disease discover medical screening would elicit safety concern , ( e.g . renal failure hemodialysis , psychiatric disorder , chronic fatigue syndrome , etc . ) Pacemakers implant cardiac defibrillator</criteria>
