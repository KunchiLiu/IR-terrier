	<criteria>The study group consist 3 balance group 20 subject . A functionally constipate group ( FC ) , irritable bowel syndrome constipation group ( IBSC ) , healthy control group ( HC ) . The FC IBSC group study population interest measure improvement digestive comfort , HC ensure adverse event , confirm kiwifruit suitable consumption general healthy population . All participant must fall within : 1 . Adult ( 1865 year ) . Females require declare stage menstrual cycle different trial phase . 2 . BMI 1835 Screening questionnaire participant selection , together sample ROME III FC/ IBSC criterion screen question provide Appendix C. This questionnaire enable potential participant screen FC IBSC , together `` red flag '' question determine participant suitability . The functionally constipate ( FC ) study participant group select base follow criterion : 1 . Presence functional constipation accord ROME III diagnostic criteria*5b . Must include two follow : 1 . Straining least 25 % defecation 2 . Lumpy hard stool least 25 % defecation 3 . Sensation incomplete evacuation least 25 % defecation 4 . Sensation anorectal obstruction/blockage least 25 % defecation 5 . Manual manoeuvre facilitate least 25 % defecation ( e.g . digital evacuation , support pelvic floor ) 6 . Fewer three defecation per week ii . Loose stool rarely present without use laxative iii . Insufficient criterion irritable bowel syndrome * Criteria fulfil last 3 month symptom onset least 6 month prior diagnosis 2 . Participants IBSC ( mild ) . The diagnostic criterion * Irritable Bowel Syndrome5a : Recurrent abdominal pain discomfort** least 3 day per month last 3 month associate 2 following : . Improvement defecation ii . Onset associate change frequency stool iii . Onset associate change form ( appearance stool ) * Criteria fulfil last 3 month symptom onset least 6 month prior diagnosis ** Discomfort mean uncomfortable sensation describe pain . In pathophysiology research clinical trial , pain/discomfort frequency least 2 day week screen evaluation subject eligibility . IBSC require meet IBS criterion together hard lumpy stool ( Bristol Stool Form Scale 12 ) ≥ 25 % , loose mushy stool ≤ 25 % bowel movement ( Bristol Stool Form Scale 67 ) . Potential participant exclude alarm feature associate bowel habit ( recent change bowel habit ( &lt; 3 month ) , rectal bleeding , weight loss , occult blood stool , anaemia ) , anal fissure , bleed haemorrhoid , family history GI cancer IBD . Chronic disease ( cardiovascular , cancer , renal failure , previous gastrointestinal surgery ( include appendectomy cholecystectomy ) , neurological condition ( e.g . multiple sclerosis , spinal chord injury , stroke ) . All patient screen recruitment fast blood glucose . Those result ≥ 7.2 mmol/l accept trial . Participants diagnose stable condition require use SSRI 's ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) , tricyclates , opiates antiinflammatories permit trial condition medication use continually condition stable &gt; 3 month . Similarly stable control diabetes ( &gt; 3 month ) permit participate . Women pregnant , breastfeed plan pregnancy 3 month post selection ( trial period ) exclude .
