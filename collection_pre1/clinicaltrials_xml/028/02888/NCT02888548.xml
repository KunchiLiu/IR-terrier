	<brief_summary>Upper limb spasticity currently mainly manage local toxin treatment . Recent study suggest combine botulinum toxin injection splint optimise rehabilitation spastic patient . However , one study focus exclusively low limb spasticity , second elbow flexor hypertonia , last wrist finger spasticity child . A study perform adult patient upper limb spasticity treat botulinum toxin injection use primary objective tolerance dynamic splinting . The author note need botulinum toxin reduce 2 patient 6 . No study conduct date splint + toxin combination adult . Another study show stretching session 2 week muscle give botulinum toxin help improve toxin 's efficacy 2 , 6 12 week injection . For reason , rehabilitation team routinely prescribe 10 session physiotherapy 15 day botulinum treatment . Based principle , hypothesise dynamic night splint apply botulinum toxin treatment may also increase toxin 's efficacy . We choose dynamic splint provide continuous stretch wrist finger extension whilst allow active flexion . Night splint thought promote optimal functional use paretic upper limb day thus prevent learn non-use , could worsen spasticity . Each patient receive treatment cycle , whose result compare , patient act his/her control . The evaluation base Tardieu scale choose great inter-individual reproducibility great reliability measure spasticity . The degree extension wrist finger provide splint adjust patient 's clinical condition elastic tensioners . The purpose splint maintain stretch beyond Tardieu spasticity angle fast speed ( V3 ) without reach maximum extension , could harmful . This protocol design determine whether dynamic night hand splint combine botulinum toxin injection improve botulinum antispastic efficacy adult brain damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised , Evaluation-blinded , Crossover , Controlled Study Assessing Dynamic Hand Splinting Adults With Post-stroke Hemiplegia ( Orthox )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicentre , randomise , evaluation-blinded , crossover , pilot study , include different treatment cycle : control cycle ( toxin alone ) study cycle ( toxin + splinting ) . It conduct two site : CHU de Reims UGECAM de Charleville Mézières . The study population include patient upper limb spasticity associate functional impairment and/or pain . To include , patient must non-naïve botulinum toxin , period least 4 month since last toxin injection . Each patient give botulinum toxin injection hypertonic muscle his/her upper limb begin cycle , i.e . D0 Phase 1 ( D0P1 ) D0 Phase 2 ( D0P2 ) . This mean patient receive two set injection 5-month interval whole duration study . 1 . If effect toxin still present 5 month ( W20 ) , visit follow cycle may delay ensure cycle comparable ( per routine practice ) . 2 . If effect still present end second cycle , patient follow-up extended end effect . As first study type , require number subject calculate decision take conduct pilot study . The required number patient set 30 reason clinical relevance study site capacity . The patient randomise centrally two arm 15 patient : - Arm A : control cycle ( toxin alone ) follow study cycle ( toxin + splinting ) - Arm B : study cycle ( toxin + splinting ) follow control cycle ( toxin alone ) The second set toxin injection perform 5 month first set . As effect toxin last 12 20 week maximum , interval ensures effect first injection worn second set injection give . Botulinum toxin administer electrical stimulation guidance improve accuracy injection muscle . Dysport® dose adjusted muscle group treat . The post-injection rehabilitation protocol identical cycle , include 10 session physiotherapy stretch inject muscle ( per routine practice ) . The prescription session standardise . These daily session start day follow botulinum injection , continue 5 time week 2 week treatment phase . For study cycle , splint worn night ( 8.00 pm 8.00 ) 4 week , start first even toxin injection . Any previous on-going drug treatment also record . Concomitant oral antispastic treatment authorise provide initiated prior patient 's inclusion study , dosage regimen remain unchanged . The investigator perform evaluation blind treatment cycle , i.e . he/she know treatment cycle patient currently . Therefore , evaluate , inject splint-referring physician three different people . To limit potential bias , 3 person remain study patient include .</detailed_description>
