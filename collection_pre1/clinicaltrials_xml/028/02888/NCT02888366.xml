	<brief_title>A Prospective Validation Study Rapid Point-of-Care Breath Test Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Clinical perspective breath test breast cancer : Breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer woman , second lung cancer cause cancer death . The National Cancer Institute estimate 232,000 US woman would diagnose breast cancer 2013 nearly 40,000 would die disease . Screening mammography limitation : In order reduce number breast cancer death , many country establish screen mammography program detect treat early-stage disease . However , impact screen mammography mortality question . Also , screen mammography limit low yield : 2005 retrospective analysis report 510 US radiologist perform 2,289,132 screen mammogram find 9,030 cancer i.e . one cancer find every 253 mammogram . 99.6 % screen mammogram negative cancer : provide reassurance , human cost million woman expose potentially hazardous radiation discomfort , financial cost several million dollar . Also , screen mammography may associate increased risk radiation-induced breast cancer , well overdiagnosis overtreatment . Many woman decide take test even readily available , screen mammography may underutilized fear pain radiation exposure , ethnicity , poverty , level education . Breath test - new diagnostic tool : Abnormal volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) breath identify breast cancer . Breath VOC biomarkers report disorder include bronchial asthma , lung cancer , active pulmonary tuberculosis , radiation exposure , heart transplant rejection . The Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve nitric oxide breath test bronchial asthma , urea breath test H. pylorus , Menssana Research 's Heartsbreath test heart transplant rejection Humanitarian Device Exemption regulation .</detailed_description>
