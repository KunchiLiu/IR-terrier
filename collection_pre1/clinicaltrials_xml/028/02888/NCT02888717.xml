	<detailed_description>The para-aortic lymph node involvement advance stage cervical cancer poor prognostic factor overall survival . Concomitant chemoradiotherapy become standard treatment advanced cervical cancer . In case para-aortic lymph node involvement , extension radiotherapy field recommend . A prospective multicenter study show survival rate patient node ≤ 5 mm benefit expansion radiotherapy field identical survival pN0 patient . However , due specific disease , technique perform patient . It necessary reliably select patient retroperitoneal lymph node involvement . For , recommend prior concurrent chemoradiotherapy , nodal stag surgery definitive histological analysis . So suggest use molecular diagnostic test OSNA ( One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification ) improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity achieve ultra-staging compare conventional histology . We propose consider new concordance study assess feasibility technical OSNA new indication : cervical cancer . The analysis protocol concordance study regardless location cancer . We evaluate use OSNA order ultrastaging lymph node involvement patient advance cancer cervix . Our hypothesis OSNA would : - well usual histological stag method - equivalence term sensitivity specificity compare intensive histological method To complete study propose search initial brain tumor expression cytokeratin 19 .</detailed_description>
