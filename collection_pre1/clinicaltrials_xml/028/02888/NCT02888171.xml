	<brief_title>Impact Ferric Citrate v Ferrous Sulfate Iron Parameters Hemoglobin Individuals With CKD Iron Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ferric citrate FDA-approved oral phosphorus binder show effective reduce serum phosphorus fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) concentration increase iron store hemoglobin individual non-dialysis-dependent CKD iron-deficiency anemia . This may prove advantageous individual pre-dialysis CKD require iron supplementation iron-deficiency anemia . This ferric citrate may restore iron store individual iron deficient , lower FGF23 concentration , ferric citrate may increase local systemic concentration 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , powerful inhibitor hepcidin synthesis , potentially attenuate increase hepcidin follow oral iron supplementation . When compare standard iron supplementation therapy ( e.g. , oral ferrous sulfate ) powerfully stimulate hepcidin secretion , may allow great iron bioavailability increase iron absorption gut also reduce degree iron sequestration reticuloendothelial system store . However , little known comparative effectiveness treatment oral ferric citrate vs. oral ferrous sulfate ( currently standard care ) increase iron store hemoglobin iron-deficient CKD patient . If ferric citrate show improve overall iron status , also partially mitigate long-term effect iron supplementation hepcidin secretion increase endogenously produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , may indicate ferric citrate provide superior short- long-term effect iron-restricted erythropoiesis CKD compare current standard care . The main objective study compare impact ferric citrate compare standard care ferrous sulfate serum iron , percent transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) , ferritin , hemoglobin hepcidin concentration individual moderate severe CKD absolute iron deficiency .</detailed_description>
