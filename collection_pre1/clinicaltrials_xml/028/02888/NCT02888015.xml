	<brief_title>Benefits Upper Extremity Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This evidence-based project base current research literature search . It case series design . Patients select medical intensive care unit provide daily upper extremity exercise program complete addition standard intervention completion activity daily live . Currently therapist within intensive care unit ability provide upper extremity exercise program set standard care place exercise do daily basis patient . Subject Selection Patients project select medical intensive care unit Upstate University Hospital . The physical therapist work medical intensive care unit provide patient handout highlight project . Patients instructed nurse contact co-investigator Vocera . Patients required sign consent form voluntarily participate project . Patients expect engage initial evaluation take hour . Participation daily treatment session also expect patient stay hospital . Treatment session last 30-60 minute day continue throughout patient stay medical intensive care unit maximum six week , duration implementation phase project . Statistical Methods , Data Analysis Interpretation Quantitative data collect use Activity Measures Post Acute Care , manual muscle test activity-tracking sheet . Information collect Activity Measures Post Acute Care use determine improvement level assist activity daily live ( dress , bathing , toileting ) . The score manual muscle test use determine improvement upper extremity strength , data collect activity-tracking chart use see improvement activity tolerance . Comparison data manual muscle test use information initial evaluation time discharge medical intensive care unit . The Activity Measures Post Acute Care activity-tracking chart perform session data compare span patient stay medical intensive care unit . Study Procedures Pre-Intervention Procedures - Request obtain permission Director therapy Upstate Hospital . Received 5/31/2016 - Request obtain permission use Activity Measure Post Acute Care assessment . - Completed CITI train requirement IRB approval Upstate Hospital . - Discuss purpose project review recruitment handout Physical therapist medical intensive care unit . - Develop photocopy recruitment handout Physical therapist . - Develop set 5 upper extremity exercise patient participate daily develop Physio-Tools . These exercise specialize client ' need . Implementation project - The physical therapist medical intensive care unit conduct physical therapy initial evaluation time patient inform evidence base project-taking place via handout provide physical therapist . - The co- investigator notify patient 's interest project nurse call primary investigator Vocera . - The consent interview conduct co-investigator . Prior completion initial occupational therapy evaluation , discussion project patient take place answer question may come . Following discussion participant sign inform consent - The co- investigator perform initial occupational therapy evaluation ass patient 's ability complete functional transfer , upper body strength manual muscle test ability perform activity daily live determine functional baseline . The outcome measure use assess activity daily live Activity Measure-Post Acute Care assessment . - Patients provide upper extremity exercise program develop Physio-Tools . Physio Tools extensive library exercise . Each exercise customize number set reps , resistance . There set 5 exercise focus increase upper body strength . The 5 exercise choose base need patient determine score manual muscle test . - Patients ask engage exercise program daily basis stay intensive care unit . Patients complete exercise supervision co- investigator regularly schedule therapy session . During time patient provide education proper technique performing exercise well vitals monitor ensure safety . - While complete exercise program co- investigator track active minute patient engage exercise track inactive minute rest . This allow comparison session session rate activity tolerance improving . - Participants complete program one time day regular therapy session . As tolerance improve patient may ask increase repetition and/or may provide resistance band make challenging . - To complete whole exercise program take 30 minute session ; time also include rest break . Therapy session take place 5 time week full time patient medical intensive care unit . - The exercise program complete session co- investigator . During therapy session , participant ask engage activity daily live . These task include dress , bathing , toileting grooming . - During initial evaluation patient determine activity daily live need complete order able safely discharge home . Adaptive equipment activity daily live provide need . To successful activity daily live within hospital setting , adaptive equipment bedside commode , raise toilet seat roll walker provide assist achieve independence . - During 6 week long project Activity Measure-Post Acute Care measure , manual muscle test track active inactive minutest complete session .</detailed_description>
