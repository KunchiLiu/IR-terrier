	<brief_title>Pharmacoepidemiological Study Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Lorraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early stage disease , 90 % patient chronic renal failure present evidence bone remodel due secondary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) . As disease progress patient require dialysis end-stage renal failure ( ESRF ) , incidence secondary HPT decline 25-40 % reduce bone remodel show osteomalacia observe 4-12 % patient adynamic bone 20-40 % . Observational study describe association serum phosphorus level , phosphorus-calcium product , parathormone ( PTH ) level , mortality . Since real consensus , treatment , basically diet drug , tailor individual . The therapeutic range wide interaction frequent . Therapeutic efficacy compromise variability PTH assay result , ambulatory nature intervention , poor patient adherence . The guideline issue 2003 stipulate corrective measure , i.e . dietetic counseling without drug therapy , need serum PTH exceed 300 pg/ml . When PTH level exceed 500 , even 800 pg/ml , HPT constitute indication parathyroid surgery calcimimetic treatment . Data randomize comparison cinacalcet surgery lacking . The evidence-based decision surgery make conjointly nephrologist , surgeon patient , limit feasibility randomization . Parathyroidectomy achieve three technique whose efficacy study historical observational study . Cinacalcet receive marketing approval 2004 `` treatment secondary HPT patient ESRF treat dialysis . Mimpara use context regimen include phosphate chelators and/or vitamin D analog , need '' . Four double-blind study demonstrate efficacy cinacalcet versus placebo decrease PTH level , proof efficacy cinacalcet term cardiovascular event mortality . One cost-effectiveness study show parathyroidectomy superior cinacalcet , except patient dialysis short period renal transplantation present contraindication surgery . While randomized trial gold standard , trial include limited number patient limited period time . This enable observation long-term practice adverse effect . Moreover , trial concern patient co-morbid condition take several drug , particular , elderly subject . The concept pharmacoepidemiological study describe real-life population take give drug , use quantitative qualitative parameter determine efficacy , risk , drug use real-life condition free constraint clinical trial . ÉPHÉYL observational pharmacoepidemiological study concern prescription calcimimetic agent parathyroidectomy patient ESRF dialysis present severe secondary HPT ( PTH ≥ 500 pg/ml ) . The aim describe indication efficacy : control PTH , calcium phosphorus serum level within recommend range , patient tolerance therapeutic intervention , cost intervention , well patient ' adhesion treatment self-assessed quality-of-life . This three-year inclusion study , base Lorraine REIN registry , involve participant Néphrolor network . The study begin April 1st , 2009 .</detailed_description>
