	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy Intranasal Oxytocin Among Individuals With Persistent Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale : Oxytocin ( OT ) neuropeptide produce supraoptic paraventricular nucleus hypothalamus . There exist least three plausible mechanism OT may decrease pain sensitivity . In brief , first mechanism involve spinal signaling . A direct hypothalamo-spinal projection originate paraventricular nucleus transport OT , dorsal horn ( Lamina-I , II , IV ) , area contain OT receptor influence glutamate GABA cellular signaling . The second mechanism involve indirect pathway via endogenous opioids . Evidence suggest OT bind opioid receptor may also stimulate endogenous opioid release brain . Finally , OT may decrease pain improve mood , decrease anxiety , mitigate stress response . Thirty-three animal investigation assess OT-pain relationship 29 report exogenous administration higher endogenous level decrease pain . There lack clarity OT-pain association human literature due paucity methodologically rigorous trial . Thus far , OT administration report low pain sensitivity among patient experience chronic back pain , headache , constipation , colon pain . To date , research evaluate association intranasal OT chronic pelvic pain . The association OT pain may different woman pelvic pain relative chronic pain condition potential peripheral OT-pain pathway . There abundance OT receptor uterus , OT potent uterogenic agent clinically use large dos stimulate uterine contraction induce labor . While OT cross blood-brain-barrier , central administration intranasal OT increase central blood-plasma OT concentration . Thus , intranasal OT administration may associate pain central peripheral pathway ; however uterine contraction 24IU dos intranasal OT occur 1 every 100-1000 people . 2 . Research question objectives : This research pilot study efficacy intranasal OT improve pain function among woman chronic pelvic pain primarily musculoskeletal origin 3 . Design : This study utilize double-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects crossover design . Participants complete 6-weeks test consist two 2-week intranasal administration separate 2-week washout period</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonmenopausal woman chronic pelvic musculoskeletal pain ( i.e. , pain exceed 6months duration locate primarily pelvic region reproducible palpation muscle span pelvic floor ) eligible participate : 1 ) regular menstrual period ( monthly within 2135 day range ) ; 2 ) use permanent barrier form contraception ; 3 ) commit change medication 6weeks study ; 4 ) moderate amount pain baseline ( i.e. , pain score 47 10 numeric rating scale ) . A baseline pain score 47 10 select prevent floor ceiling effect ensure participant room change throughout course study . Muscle pain result systemic disease , score positive urine pregnancy test , concurrent use another nasal spray , nasal pathology ( e.g. , ear , nose , throat diagnosis ) , diabetes insipidus , previous concurrent use narcotic deliver intranasally ( e.g. , cocaine ) , contemplate pregnancy , sacroiliac instability define European Guidelines . Women also exclude primary diagnosis endometriosis , dysmenorrhea , interstitial cystitis , functional bowel disorder , fibromyalgia neuropathic pain .</criteria>
