	<brief_summary>Rationale In Belgium , unique situation exist two reason : one hand , pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) program , start 2007 , quickly reach high coverage infant : 3-dose coverage rise 89 % 2008 96.5 % 2012 Flanders 80.7 % 2009 89.2 % 2012 Wallonia ; hand , serotype coverage move PCV7 ( since 2007 ) PCV13 ( since 2011 ) recently PCV10 ( since July 2015 Flanders expect May 2016 French Community ) . Invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) surveillance demonstrate major impact PCV13 serotypes infant &lt; 2 year age . The impact current change PCV-program hard predict , could eventually result re-emergence serotypes cover PCV10 ( i.e . 3 , 6A 19A ) . With unique situation foundation lay carriage study nasopharyngeal carriage Streptococcus pneumonia ( Sp ) common colonizer nasopharynx study infant acute otitis medium ( AOM ) healthy infant attend day-care center ( DCC ) , two population high report pneumococcal carriage . Young child important reservoir major source transmission bacteria whole community thus prefer population study nasopharyngeal ( NP ) carriage . Aim study The main aim study evaluate change conjugate anti-pneumococcal vaccination program Belgium impact nasopharyngeal carriage Pneumococcus infant age 6-30 month suffer AOM attend day-care , order guide future pneumococcal vaccine program decision vaccine development , fee AOM treatment guideline PCV-program environment . The study monitor overall pneumococcal carriage , serotypes involve sensitivity isolated strain antibiotic . In addition , rhinopharyngeal carriage common nasopharyngeal colonizer associate disease , particular Haemophilus influenzae , study order evaluate change pneumococcal carriage impact carriage pathogen . In infant AOM , study also monitor clinical course AOM second nasopharyngeal sample take case antibiotic treatment failure AOM recurrence identify association carry pathogen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population Two infant population high ( 50 % ) report carriage Sp identify approach study : 1 . Infants age 6-30 month present acute otitis medium ( accord specific clinical otoscopic criterion ) first line general physician paediatrician recently receive antibiotic severe underlying disease ( AOM infant ) . 2 . Healthy infant age 6-30 month attend day-care center recently receive antibiotic ( DCC infant ) . Investigator ( ) , study sit 75-87 paediatrician general practitioner ( GPs ) , approximately 75 DCC throughout whole Belgium . Paediatricians first line hospital allow participate . The Primary objective detect significant prevalence change Sp serotypes 19A 6A carriage observation period ( three year , 2016-2018 ) study population ( AOM DCC infant ) . Number subject In first year ( 2016 ) , 700 second year ( 2016-2017 ) onward 900 , patient AOM ( age 6 30 month ) include every year . The number healthy infant attend DCC include year . Sample size calculate allow comparison child recruit first winter season , receive PCV13 majority pneumococcal vaccination , child follow season , receive PCV10 majority pneumococcal vaccination . Some over-recruitment do first winter ( 2016 ) infant vaccinate region yet change PCV13 PCV10 , since infant receive PCV13 12 month booster . The propose sample size allow detect change low 3 % 19A 6A combine , 4 % separately 80 % power , AOM day-care infant group . Period observation Since Sp carriage well AOM prevalent around winter season , recruitment schedule focusing period . In 2016 , recruitment infant present AOM foreseen January till end May , extend June necessary achieve target number . Thereafter , infant AOM recruit every year October till end May ( start October 2016 ) . For healthy infant attend DCC recruitment plan start March 2016 , thereafter every season October 1st till May 31st . The current protocol cover first observation period , 2016 2018 cover 3 winter season .</detailed_description>
