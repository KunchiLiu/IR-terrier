	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy ADSTEM Inj . Patients With Moderately Subacute Chronic Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) type inflammation skin . It result itchy , swollen , red , crack skin . The symptom typically start childhood change severity year . The pathogenesis AD characterize excessive type 2 helper T cell mediate inflammatory response , result B lymphocyte mediate increase serum level immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) . Subsequent degranulation mast cell IgE release various inflammatory mediator , recruit lymphocytes eosinophils lesion . Current clinical management AD include topical corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressant . However , drug report carry risk side-effects severe . Several recent study include demonstrate mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) could suppress allergic response AD . MSCs know interact cell type innate adaptive immune system , result suppressive effect proliferation , differentiation , activation immune cell include T cell , B cell , dendritic cell , natural killer cell . Indeed , number study report immunomodulatory ability MSCs usefully apply treatment autoimmune inflammation-related disease asthma , rhinitis , dermatitis . Therefore , MSCs possibility new drug AD .</detailed_description>
