	<brief_summary>The study two objective : 1 . To obtain endoscopic colonoscopic biopsy harvest culture intestinal crypt human tissue produce organoids . These organoids use study biology innervate sensory epithelial cell . 2. collect subject data relate clinical management demographic characteristic patient undergo upper endoscopy colonoscopy learn mechanism behind visceral hypersensitivity , neurodegenerative disease may arise gut .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Throughout gastrointestinal tract specialize sensory epithelial cell recognize stimuli nutrient bacteria . These cell traditionally know endocrine function . However , recently discover use mouse model cell receive synaptic input enteric peripheral neuron , cell body dorsal root ganglia vagal nodose . This finding open possibility , include follow : 1 ) sensory function gastrointestinal tract modulate neural activity ; 2 ) gut bacteria influence brain function direct neural circuit ; 3 ) virus preferentially infect neuron access central nervous system neural circuit [ 1,2 ] . To translate finding animal model human , investigator must test hypothesis physiology gut sensory epithelial cell resembles human . Visceral hypersensitivity core symptom several gastrointestinal brain behavior disorder , include irritable bowel syndrome , autism anorexia . Unfortunately , basic mechanism sensory process wall gut non-existent . This lack knowledge precludes development therapeutic strategy treat disorder link visceral hypersensitivity . The investigator 's effort translate animal research human model foundation develop target therapy visceral hypersensitivity . Today , possible derive organoids intestinal crypt harvest human intestinal colonic tissue . The organoids epithelial cell type , include gut sensory cell . Here , investigator 's goal use de-identified human tissue culture intestinal organoids laboratory , use platform study biology innervate sensory epithelial cell . This work significant open possibility learn mechanism behind visceral sensation neurodegenerative disease may arise gut .</detailed_description>
