	<brief_title>Durvalumab Tremelimumab With Without High Low-Dose Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combine checkpoint blockade durvalumab tremelimumab alone high low-dose radiation non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( NSCLC Cohort ) II . To compare overall response ( exclude irradiate lesion [ ] ) combine checkpoint blockade durvalumab tremelimumab alone combine checkpoint blockade low high dose radiation . ( NSCLC Cohort ) III . To assess safety tolerability combine checkpoint blockade durvalumab tremelimumab high low-dose radiation . ( Colorectal Cohort ) IV . To determine overall response rate ( exclude irradiate lesion [ ] ) combine checkpoint blockade durvalumab tremelimumab either low high dose radiation . ( Colorectal Cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate median progression-free survival overall survival . ( NSCLC Cohort ) II . To determine local control within irradiated field ( ) abscopal response rate . ( NSCLC Cohort ) III . To evaluate association PD-L1 expression well level infiltrate CD3+ , CD8+ T-cells overall response . ( NSCLC Cohort ) IV . To explore change PD-L1 expression , circulate T-cell population , T-cell infiltration , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) expression , spatial relationship immune marker , mutational burden result low high dose radiation . ( NSCLC Cohort ) V. To estimate median progression-free survival overall survival . ( Colorectal Cohort ) VI . To determine local control within irradiated field abscopal response rate . ( Colorectal Cohort ) VII . To evaluate association PD-L1 expression well level infiltrate CD3+ CD8+ T-cells overall response . ( Colorectal Cohort ) VIII . To evaluate change PD-L1 expression well level infiltrate CD3+ , CD8+ T-cells induce target low high dose radiation . ( Colorectal Cohort ) IX . To explore change circulate T-cell population , T-cell infiltration , RNA expression , spatial relationship immune marker , mutational burden result low high dose radiation . OUTLINE : Patients NSCLC randomize Arm A , B , C. Patients colorectal cancer randomize Arm B C. COHORT 1 : Patients NSCLC randomize 1 3 arm . ARM A : Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously ( IV ) durvalumab IV 60 minute every 4 week 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive durvalumab IV 60 minute 4 week last combination dose 9 additional dos . ARM B : Patients receive tremelimumab durvalumab Arm A . Beginning week 2 , patient receive high dose radiation therapy per day ( QD ) 10 day 3 fraction . ARM C : Patients receive tremelimumab durvalumab Arm A . Beginning week 2 , patient receive low dose radiation therapy every 6 hour twice per day ( BID ) week 2 , 6 , 10 14 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
