	<criteria>Requirements age : male 9 17 year old , females 9 30 year old . Willing provide statutory certificate identity . For subject 18 30 year old , able understand clinical trial agree sign informed consent ; subject 9 17 year old , guardian able understand clinical trial , sign inform consent together subject . Female subject pregnancy birth plan 7 month enrol , agree take effective contraception period . People history cervical cancer HPV infection relate disease condyloma People history severe allergic reaction require medical intervention ( garget , difficult breathing , hypotension shock ) People history serious side effect vaccination severe allergic reaction food drug People epilepsy history mental illness People immune deficiency diagnose congenital acquire immunodeficiency , HIV infection , lymphoma , leukemia , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ) , inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune diseases , people immunosuppressive therapy past six month . People serious liver kidney disease , cardiovascular disease , severe hypertension , diabetes , cancer , kinds infectious disease acute disease acute attack period chronic disease Asplenia , functional asplenia , situation lead asplenia splenectomize . People diagnose doctor coagulation dysfunction ( lack clotting factor , disorder blood coagulation blood platelet disorder ) , apparent bruise blood coagulation disorder ; People give whole blood , plasma immunoglobulin therapy within 3 month vaccination . People get vaccine within 14 day trial . People fever vaccination , axillary temperature high 37.0 ℃ . Females suckle period , pregnancy ( pregnancy test positive ) prepare pregnant . People abnormal laboratory index . ( slight abnormity except judged clinical significance doctor . ) People get HPV vaccine ; people use plan use vaccine unregistered product ( drug vaccine ) within 30 day first dose ; people plan participate clinical trial within 6 month clinical trial . According judgement researcher , subject factor appropriate clinical trial . The exclusion criterion second third dose： Urine pregnancy test positive vaccination . Receiving blood product study drug enrollment . Suffering serious illness serious adverse event require continuous treatment . Situations need except accord judgement researcher confirmation Ethics Committee . Newly occur discovered people meet exclusion criterion first dose first vaccination . Delayed immunization : Acute infectious disease , temperature 37.0 ℃or acute attack chronic disease inoculation . Physical examination abnormal day vaccination . Researchers think subject belong temporary contraindication vaccination . Withdrawal criterion : Any situation exclusion criterion enrollment . People suffers disease need treat immune inhibitor drop , case harm disease need treat immune inhibitor . Serious adverse event : event need prolong hospitalization , disability , threaten life death . Researchers decide whether quit trial . Against plan deviation plan : 1. plan event appropriate informed consent subject ; subject get research meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . subject use vaccine preserve request . serious adverse event ( SAE ) report timely report . subject proactively use forbidden drug ( antiallergic drug , antipyretic analgesic , accept systemic corticosteroid 2 mg/kg/day intramuscular injection , oral intravenous administration , continue 14 day , immune inhibitor ) . 2. deviation plan exceed Window supervision . blood sample subject collect sample quantity enough finish test . enough interval vaccine .</criteria>
