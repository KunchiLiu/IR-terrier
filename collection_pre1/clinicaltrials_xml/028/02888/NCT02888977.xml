	<brief_summary>The use imatinib combination chemotherapy consider gold standard treatment Ph+ ALL . The complete remission ( CR ) rate 90 % versus 20 % 40 % chemotherapy alone . The combination imatinib , vincristine dexamethasone well tolerated regimen age patient also associate high CR rate 80 % 90 % patient age 55 year . 2 . Dasatinib indicate first line therapy Ph+ ALL . Results EWALLPH-01 supporting use dasatinib combination low-intensity chemotherapy . A new EWALL-PH-02 study combine nilotinib combination low-intensity chemotherapy currently initiate within EWALL center . 3 . The EWALL-PH-01 trial close recruitment 71 patient . The activation EWALL-PH-02 trial expect Q1 2012 . Based recruitment EWALL-PH-01 study could anticipate 50 100 patient age 55 year diagnose 6 month period time . In addition , EWALL center participate EWALL-PH-02 study thus center could offer treat patient follow EWALL backbone addition imatinib . 4 . A minimum data set define order collect data patient treat follow EWALL-PH imatinib study . The main recommendation follow close possible procedure EWALL-PH-01 trial ( mutation analysis , MRD follow-up ) order comparable data set . This imatinib treat cohort patient would particular importance order well define potential benefit use one TKI compare one . From end EWALL-PH-01 study recruitment initiation EWALL-PH-02 study , patient treat follow common backbone schedule combination imatinib others TKI . Patients include clinical trial reason also offer treatment combination TKIs backbone low-intensity chemotherapy . The goal observatory retrospective prospective describe efficacy tolerance combination tyrosine kinase inhibitor combination low intensity chemotherapy ( EWALL backbone ) patient Ph+ ALL age 55 year .</brief_summary>
