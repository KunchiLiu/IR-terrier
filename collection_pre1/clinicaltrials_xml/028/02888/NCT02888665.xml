	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose doxorubicin hydrochloride give together pembrolizumab see well work treat patient sarcoma spread part body remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride together pembrolizumab may work well treat patient sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Sarcoma That Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination pembrolizumab doxorubicin hydrochloride ( doxorubicin ) patient advance soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) . II . To assess clinical response rate advance soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) patient receive combination pembrolizumab doxorubicin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore clinical activity pembrolizumab subject advanced STS respect time response . II . To explore clinical activity pembrolizumab subject advanced STS respect duration response . III . To explore clinical activity pembrolizumab subject advanced STS respect progression-free survival ( PFS ) . IV . To explore clinical activity pembrolizumab subject advanced STS respect overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate patient high level PD-L1 expression PD-L1 absent . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study doxorubicin hydrochloride follow phase II study . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1-3 hour day 1 course 2-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
