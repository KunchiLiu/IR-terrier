	<brief_title>Phase 2a Study Evaluate Safety/Tolerability Efficacy TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution Once Daily 4 Weeks Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TOP1288 , first new class agent call narrow spectrum protein kinase inhibitor ( NSKIs ) , develop novel , non-absorbed treatment ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . UC disease unknown cause characterise inflammation line large intestine manifest abdominal pain bloody diarrhoea . TOP1288 give rectally local anti-inflammatory action experimental model UC . A Phase I placebo-controlled , single ascend dose ( SAD ) multiple ascend dose ( MAD ) study TOP1288 conduct 61 healthy volunteer demonstrate rectal administration TOP1288 dose 200 mg BID 4 day safe well tolerate , minimal systemic absorption . TOP1288 200 mg , administer daily , therefore offer potential safe effective novel approach treat patient serious condition . This Phase 2a proof-of-concept study evaluate 200 mg daily dose TOP1288 , base favourable tolerability Phase 1 study . It administer TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution compare Placebo Rectal Solution , contain non-active excipients present active solution . This randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicentre study design evaluate safety/tolerability efficacy TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution follow once-daily bedtime treatment 4 consecutive week . The study include approximately 40 site Europe . Randomization study treatment 2:1 , approximately 40 subject randomise TOP1288 approximately 20 subject randomise placebo . The Screening period 28 day prior first day dose double-blind study treatment ( Visit 1 ) . A central reading facility use determine eligibility base upon Screening flexible sigmoidoscopy . Visit 2 schedule Day 7 dosing , Visit 3 Day 29 dosing . There 1-week safety follow-up period Visit 3 . The total duration study participation give subject ~65 day 9 week</detailed_description>
