	<brief_summary>Cryopreservation ovarian tissue offer young girl woman age 35 undergo sterilize gonadotoxic treatment , aim preserve fertility . The main part ovary preserve , primordial primary follicle resistant freeze / thawing protocol . In absence technique ( vivo maturation , inject isolated ovarian follicle , etc . ) autografting cryopreserved tissue currently technique allow fertility restore . Autograft possible indication ovary cryopreservation non-neoplastic pathology malignant pathology low risk ovarian metastasis . In case neoplastic pathology , particularly case acute leukemia , tissue yet re-used due lack codify technique evaluate residual disease ( MRD ) . The team two year develop validate technique look residual disease fragment ovarian cortex case acute leukemia . This technique base original protocol dissociate ovarian tissue obtain population isolated ovarian cell may analyze multicolor flow cytometry . The specificity sensitivity technique demonstrate experimental model . This model consist use 8 color flow cytometry look characterizable leukemia cell add different dilution population isolate ovarian cell take model ovarian cortex dilution 10-5 . When molecular marker present diagnosis , find RQ-PCR dilution . The model tissue come laparoscopic ovarian drilling patient polycystic ovary syndrome . The main objective project validate technique previously codify different population leukemia cell may characterize . We aim adapt validate technique look MRD use 8 color flow cytometry cryopreserved fragment ovarian cortex leukemia patient risk metastasis . Secondary objective implement procedure oncological qualification graft case malignant pathology consider recommendation use cryopreserved ovarian tissue autograft technique indication .</brief_summary>
