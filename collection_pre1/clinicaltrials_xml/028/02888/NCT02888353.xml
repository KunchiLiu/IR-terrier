	<brief_summary>Ferromagnetic Implants permanent pacemaker ( PPM 's ) Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators ( ICD 's ) traditionally accept contraindication Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) due safety concern . Over past several year , MRI safety establish patient pacemaker ICD 's patient strict vet procedure implement . These vet procedure initially develop eliminate device , lead device/lead circumstance think carry increase risk . Over recent year however , objective scientific evidence fail support concern raise question whether vet procedure necessary . Investigators hypothesize view exist objective scientific data , evolution device technology fact investigator scan 2,000 device safely ( RPN03-08-11-12 00051707 ) ICD 's pacemaker device circumstance previously exclude MRI protocol safely scan without prior vetting . This prospective , non randomize , cohort study . Seventeen Hundred participant implant ICD pacemaker clinical need MRI include study . Unlike previous study strict vet procedure implement pre-procedure , All patient pacemaker ICD clinical need MRI eligible inclusion study provide participant meet standard MRI inclusion/exclusion safety criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot study approximately 1500 patient , RPN # 03-08-12-11 00051707 ( manuscript submit ) demonstrate safety contemporary implant rhythm management device MRI environment give appropriate precaution . When pilot study develop , theoretical concern may increase risk associate device device circumstance include : 1 ) PPM 's lead implant prior 1996 ; 2 ) ICD 's implant prior 2000 ; 3 ) abandon endocardial lead ; 4 ) lead implant &lt; 6 week ; 5 ) ICD 's patient pacemaker dependent . While reasonable hyper vigilant initiate pilot study include restrictive inclusion criterion , natural evolution device device related technology couple lack objective scientific data support investigator 's early safety concern cause investigator reevaluate necessity . For example , old pacemaker ICD 's previously exclude potential participant obsolete ; expire battery explanted . Similarly , technological evolution ICD 's include ICD 's capable provide ongoing asynchronous pace include MRI environment . Despite concern abandon , epicardial newly implant lead may increase risk heat subject torque , investigator evaluate 15 participant lead issue expose MRI ( protocol life threaten situation ) adverse problem see . The vetting procedures investigator implement pilot study require registered nurse obtain patient device information chest xrays ( indicate ) refer physician , review advance allow participant schedule MRI , exclude patient meet inclusion criterion . Investigators find procedure time consume expensive ( require part time Registered Nurse ( RN ) salary ) . In addition , case , patient might derive considerable benefit MRI exclude obtain one time take adhere vet procedure needlessly delay MRI participant , cause unnecessary stress frustration even adversely affect clinical care . MRI 's do participant require clinically indicate MRI without implement vet procedure investigator include pilot study . Participants implant pacemaker ICD 's eligible MRI Johns Hopkins Hospital ( JHH ) agree participate study . All study do 1.5 Tesla MRI unit . Since first 100 participant scan investigator 's initial protocol 03-08-11-12 , MRI scan sequence , field intensity field exposure give special consideration give presence pacemaker ICD adverse unanticipated problem . For reason , investigator feel necessary impose special restriction ( related field intensity scan sequences/exposure ) protocol . In event device manufacturer indicates need include additional safety precaution investigator amend protocol immediately include . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring pad place patient duration study . Heart rate , blood pressure , O2 saturation monitor non-invasively throughout study register electrophysiology nurse Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) certify , fully trained cardiac device management familiar research protocol well implication scan patient cardiac device . In addition electrophysiology nurse , two fully certify MRI technologist familiar scan participant implanted device present control room entire time participant scan . The scanner locate close proximity electrophysiology laboratory EP physicians perform procedure , hence time least one , typically one EP physician know participant MRI device procedure available . A Zoll external defibrillator transthoracic pace capability , ACLS drug fully equip crash cart readily available time area adjacent MRI control room . Prior MRI , participant hand alarm button instruct notify MRI technologist reason he/she feel necessary particularly event unusual pain sensation experience . Participants see technologist nurse monitoring scan large window separate scanner control room . In addition , MRI technologist frequently initiate conversation sequence ask patient ; `` '' . All device undergo complete interrogation test prior image follow imaging . PPMs program asynchronous mode dependent inhibit mode patient without pacemaker dependence . The pacemaker function ICD 's pacemaker independent patient program ventricular inhibit ( VVI ) mode 50 bpm . Pacemaker dependent participant ICD 's previously exclude prior study longer exclude ICD 's reliably capable maintain adequate pacing program asynchronous pace mode.. After appropriate MRI protocol MRI patient complete , device re-programmed original setting completely interrogate retested detect change device performance . All MRI 's clinically indicate therefore standard care . The particpants participation study terminate complete 1-6 week follow-up device evaluation also do standard care .</detailed_description>
