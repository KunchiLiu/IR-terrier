	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Conduct dose escalation trial determine tolerability fructo-oligosaccharides prebiotic allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 21 day start 7 day allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day .</detailed_description>
