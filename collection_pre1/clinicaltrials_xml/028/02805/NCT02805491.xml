	<brief_summary>Hypospadias frequent malformation external genital organ male infant . Incomplete virilization genital bud result hypoplasia tissues ventral aspect penis , ectopic ureteral meatus , curve penile shaft incompletely form foreskin . The condition generally isolated aetiology unknown . The pathogenesis complex involve hormonal , genetic environmental factor ( probably interlink ) . A double incidence hypospadias last 15 year emphasize probable role environment factor : fact , certain exogenous compound ( collectively refer `` endocrine disruptors '' ( EDs ) ) may modify hormonal function thus exert harmful effect organism offspring . The male urethra develop 8th 16th week gestation androgen-dependence manner . In utero exposure foetus EDs may physiopathological role abnormal development male genital bud thus development hypospadia . These EDs present many different substance , pesticide . Many epidemiological study evidence increase incidence hypospadias child bear exposed parent . Furthermore , animal study identify certain number compound associated hypospadias utero exposure . However , human foetal sample rarely assay attempt measure true level impregnation ( i.e . dose receive ) . At present , possible draw firm conclusion regard true extent link EDs increase incidence hypospadia . The `` HypoMeco '' project prospective case-control study .</brief_summary>
