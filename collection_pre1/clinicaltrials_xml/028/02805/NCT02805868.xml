	<brief_summary>The main purpose investigational research study determine safe tolerable study drug siltuximab patient myelofibrosis ( MF ) . This medication approve FDA another condition ( multicentric castleman 's disease ( MCD ) , myelofibrosis ( MF ) . In MCD , siltuximab result improvement symptom anemia . While MCD MF different disease , share common feature include protein call interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) may important causing symptom MCD MF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Siltuximab Treating Patients With Primary , Post-Polycythemia Vera , Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability drug siltuximab myelofibrosis patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical improvement ( CI ) . II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine siltuximab result improvement iron dysregulation . II . To determine change inflammatory stress may correlate clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive siltuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsy aspiration baseline end treatment ( within 30 day last siltuximab dose ) clinically indicate . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient decision withdraw . Patients respond 6 course may receive additional siltuximab treatment 1 year discretion study doctor . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
