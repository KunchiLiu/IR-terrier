	<brief_title>High Intensity Phototherapy : Double v . Single</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperbilirubinemia occur 60 - 80 % newborn first day life , among others immaturity enzyme uridin-glukuronosyl-transferase ( UGT1A1 ) liver . In seldom case high total serum bilirubin concentration ( TsB ) , bilirubin cross blood-brain barrier deposition unconjugated bilirubin central nervous system may cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy ( ABE ) . This progress chronic bilirubin encephalopathy ( CBE ) , devastate condition , unfortunately still occur , even industrialised country . Hyperbilirubinemia get severe 2 - 6 % infant born term late preterm , mean , need treatment prevent ABE treatment choice phototherapy due efficacy safety . Hereby bilirubin skin plasma convert photobilirubins ; water-soluble excrete liver without conjugation . They presumably non-toxic . In department , single phototherapy first choice . To avoid above-mentioned damaging condition , important optimize phototherapy . Former fluorescent tube use light source , light emission diode ( LED ) use . This study investigate whether double phototherapy reduces total serum bilirubin faster single light intensive phototherapy , use LED , whether upper limit efficacy phototherapy . It prospective , randomise control study . The infant randomize either 1 : Conventional phototherapy blue LED light distance light source mattress 30 cm , give light irradiance 66 µW/cm2/nm 2 : Conventional phototherapy combine light blanket ( Bilisoft ) light irradiance skin 39 µW/cm2/nm . TsB measure start 12 - 24 h treatment . Based calculation strength 72 infant need study . As statistical method t-tests used multiple linear regression model use adjust confound .</detailed_description>
