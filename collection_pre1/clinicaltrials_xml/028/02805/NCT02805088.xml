	<brief_summary>The initial aim project gain understanding comprehension `` language-oriented '' emotion among schizophrenic bipolar patient . By `` language-oriented '' emotion , investigator mean emotion convey mean language , whether emotional valence word , expression emotional state emotional prosody . Although involve different diagnostic category , schizophrenic bipolar disorder nevertheless share number symptom , particular emotional sphere , extent question whether may , clinical , cognitive etiopathogenic level , exist continuum disorder frequently raise . Taking hypothesis clinical continuum start point , investigator explore understanding emotion contextualized language two clinical population , namely patient exhibit schizophrenic bipolar disorder . To population , investigator also add dimension vulnerability form non-clinical participant vary term trait schizotypy hypomania , thus orient project toward early identification cognitive-emotional marker possibly also prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim proposal investigate disturbance understand `` emotional language '' schizophrenia bipolar disorder . By `` emotional langague '' , investigator mean emotion wich drawn utterance , thanks affective valence word phrase , expression emotional state prosody . Schizophrenia bipolar disorder share several symptom , particularly related emotional sphere , way frequently ask whether disorder could formalize continuum . Comparing cognitive-emotional function two kind patient allow identify cognitive marker psychotic symptom dimension common disease . On basis abundant literature regard cognitive-emotional functioning schizophrenia infrequent literature concern bipolar functioning , investigator hypothesize difficulty process emotion , attribute intentionality integrate information meaning marker psychotic symptom dimension common pathology . To test hypothesis , investigator choose investigate language understand imply semantic-emotional processing necessitates integration process . The integration process obligatory operate semantic information , add , ecological situation , prosodic intentional information . The proposed methodology involve different level language , require less complex integration process - literal language figurative language - different emotional feature - affective valence word expression emotional prosody - . The investigator plan conduct behavioral electrophysiological ( event-related potential ) study . For later , The investigator focus electrophysiological component well know implied language emotional processing : N400 , LPC ( Late Positive Component ) LPP ( Late Positive Potential ) . The combination behavioral electrophysiological indicator allow identification neurocognitive mechanism share schizophrenic bipolar patient , particularly experience psychotic episode , comparison healthy participant . These study conduct 60 stable schizophrenic patient , 60 euthymic bipolar patient without psychotic symptom , 120 healthy participant , match age educational achievement level pathological group . Different instrument use investigate , pathological group control , different emotional dimension ( anhedonia , alexithymia , positive negative affectivity , depression , anxiety ) . Investigating cognitive-emotional functioning patient dimensional approach ( psychotic symptom dimension ) rather categorical approach could impulse new way think diagnosis identify factor vulnerability protection disease .</detailed_description>
