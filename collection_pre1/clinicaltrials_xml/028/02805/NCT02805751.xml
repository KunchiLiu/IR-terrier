	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure mechanical property tendon conservative treated Achilles tendon rupture without early control loading . This do randomize trial mechanical property measure use roentgen stereometric analysis ( RSA ) . The hypothesis early weightbearing improve mechanical property conservative treat Achilles tendon rupture without cause elongation tendon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Controlled Loading Conservative Treated Achilles Tendon Ruptures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Achilles tendon rupture include surgical repair immobilization orthosis , follow prolonged rehabilitation . Improved rehabilitation regimen still display imperfect recovery , deficit persistent end-range muscle weakness , tendon elongation incomplete return pre-injury activity level . The underlying mechanism unknown , likely involve molecular cellular aspect early heal process . Animal experiment show short episode vigorous load tendon heal create strong tendon , lead less elongation continuous loading . Early control training also show improve material property surgically repair tendon . However , clinic turn away surgery towards conservative treatment , study rehabilitation mainly concern sutured tendon . It therefore also important understand best rehabilitate conservatively treat patient . The aim investigate effect early control load conservatively treat Achilles tendon rupture . The patient ( age 18-60 year age ) treat conservatively receive removable foam walker boot emergency department . The patient thereafter call principal investigator ask want participate study . Patients interested participate study receive oral write information study principal investigator study ( Pernilla Eliasson ) . After 2 week , rupture localize ultrasound 4 tantalum bead implant percutaneously proximal distal part tendon . These bead use measurement mechanical property tendon use RSA . The patient thereafter randomize early control loading control . All patient wear foam walker boot 7 week . Full weight-bearing allow tolerated beginning . Both group perform motion exercise outside boot 20 repetition , 3 time per day 14 day rupture . The patient early load group provide special training pedal pedal resistance increase treatment period . The patient use pedal twice day start 2 week rupture . After initial 7 week , patient refer physical therapist uninvolved research , instruction follow regional rehabilitation guideline Achilles tendon rupture . Mechanical property tendon estimate measure tendon length , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) stiffness week 7 , 19 52 . The elastic modulus tendon 19 week primary variable study . At week 7 , elastic plastic deformation measure . Tendon CSA evaluate use computer tomography ( CT ) . Tendon elongation evaluate RSA week 2 , 7 , 19 52 . Calf muscle circumference , passive active range motion ankle joint heel-raise test perform week 19 52 . The overall function assess Achilles Tendon Rupture Score 19 52 week . Complications re-ruptures register .</detailed_description>
