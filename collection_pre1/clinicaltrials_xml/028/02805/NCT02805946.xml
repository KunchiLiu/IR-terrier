	<detailed_description>In 2014 , new intravenous solid oral formulation posaconazole market . This offer new treatment possibility , specifically patient previously unable attain adequate exposure posaconazole solution . To opinion researcher , limit data available pharmacokinetics ( PK ) new formulation posaconazole , however , use strictly select patient healthy volunteer , importantly , specific aspect related PK remain unsolved . Despite fact adequate exposure attain use new solid oral formulation , hypothesize oral bioavailability posaconazole may impact mucositis . Whether mucosal barrier injury impact absorption posaconazole alters presystemic clearance still unknown . Therefore , seem prudent conduct trial group patient experience severe degree mucositis identify change absorption posaconazole resolve impact various stage mucositis PK posaconazole link PK posaconazole marker mucositis ( citrulline ) . This research may also serve model drug allow direct translation improve patient care . For purpose need determine PK use IV PO dose posaconazole .</detailed_description>
