	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 prospective , open-label , two cohort , non-randomized trial consist two consecutive step , dose escalation subsequent dose expansion part . PART 1 DOSE ESCALATION : subject newly diagnose Unfavorable Intermediate Risk ( UIR ) High Risk ( HR ) prostate adenocarcinoma , participate dose escalation NBTXR3 activate two different radiation schedule . NBTXR3 administer intra-prostate injection activate 10 day later either : - EBRT deliver 45 Gy 25 fraction 1.8 Gy ; prostate seminal vesicle , follow 34.2 Gy 19 fraction prostate proximal seminal vesicle , 9-10 week , utilize intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily image guidance align implanted fiducial marker ( COHORT A ) , - Brachytherapy Boost EBRT deliver single fraction 15 Gy one day prostate High Dose Rate Brachytherapy follow EBRT ( initiate within 2-4 week completion Brachytherapy ) , deliver 45 Gy 25 fraction 1.8 Gy prostate seminal vesicle utilize intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily image guidance align implanted fiducial marker ( COHORT B ) PART 2 DOSE EXPANSION : Two parallel cohort subject , A B , 20 subject per cohort , treat either RD1 ( Recommended Dose NBTXR3 give intraprostate injection activate EBRT ) RD2 ( Recommended Dose NBTXR3 give intra-prostate injection activate Brachytherapy Boost EBRT ) , determine Phase I dose escalation trial . All subject receive androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) LHRH / GnRH agonist begin 8 week NBTXR3 administration 24 month subject ( HR ) prostate adenocarcinoma . The duration ADT subject ( UIR ) disease 6 month . Subjects receive single intra-prostate injection NBTXR3 deliver prostate via transperineal injection TRUS guidance injection . NBTXR3 injection perform Day 1 assess safety , intra-prostate availability presence NBTXR3 peripheral circulation . COHORT A : External beam radiation therapy deliver prostate start within 9 day NBTXR3 injection ( Day 10 ) . Total dose 79.2 Gy , deliver 25 fraction 1.8 Gy prostate seminal vesicle ( 45 Gy ) , follow 34.2 Gy 19 fraction prostate proximal seminal vesicle , deliver 9-10 week , utilize intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily image guidance align implanted fiducial marker COHORT B : HDR Brachytherapy implantation perform within 9 day NBTXR3 injection ( Day 10 ) . Brachytherapy Boost deliver single fraction 15 Gy one day prostate High Dose Rate Brachytherapy follow EBRT ( initiate within 2-4 week completion Brachytherapy ) deliver 45 Gy 25 fraction 1.8 Gy prostate seminal vesicle utilize intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily image guidance align implanted fiducial marker . Subjects follow safety assessment end study . Before onset study treatment , subject must histologic diagnosis either Unfavorable Intermediate Risk ( UIR ) High Risk ( HR ) prostate adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
