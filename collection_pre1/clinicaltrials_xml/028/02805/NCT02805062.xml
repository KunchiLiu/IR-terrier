	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural effusion common clinical problem median survival approximately 6 month . Efficient management Malignant pleural effusion therefore major priority patient , fail procedure need repeat hospital admission limit time home family friend . The management Malignant pleural effusion involve either complete pleural fluid drainage follow form pleurodesis insertion indwell pleural catheter . Apposition parietal visceral pleural surface pre-requisite successful pleurodesis . In patient non-expansile , Trapped Lung , pleurodesis unsuccessful indwell pleural catheter insert instead . Accurate detection Trapped Lung prior insertion would avoid futile attempt talc pleurodesis , re-intervention follow fail pleurodesis allow adequate time plan indwell pleural catheter insertion , include train patient 's District Nurses . Clinical judgment currently use detect Trapped Lung . This involve review available image direct visualisation surface lung local anaesthetic thoracoscopy . Unfortunately , recent data suggest frequently inaccurate , 30 % 13 % case Trapped Lung correctly identify recent local national audit data respectively . Pleural manometry allow direct objective measurement intra-pleural pressure pleural fluid aspiration . Pleural pressure measurement also use compute Pleural Elastance , define change pleural pressure divide change pleural volume . Previous study show rapid sustain drop intra-pleural pressure fluid aspiration predict Trapped Lung data prospectively compare current clinical practice . The primary aim study determine whether addition digital pleural manometry clinical judgment , prior local anaesthetic thoracoscopy , result clinically meaningful improvement Trapped Lung detection . Digital pleural manometry record use Conformité Européene mark ( CE-marked ) device use within exist clinical indication ( develop conjunction commercial partner Rocket Medical plc ) . 65 Subjects single study visit , coincide plan clinical admission local anaesthetic thoracoscopy . Subjects exit study follow-up clinic visit 3 month date local anaesthetic thoracoscopy . A study-specific volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan pleural cavity perform per pre-defined imaging protocol . The study perform single centre : Queen Elizabeth University Hospital , Glasgow .</detailed_description>
