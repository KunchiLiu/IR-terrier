	<brief_title>Autologous Culture Expanded Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions alter natural course osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee elusive joint replacement remain definitive management refractory , end-stage disease . The Mayo Clinic large , ongoing experience use autologous adipose derive mesenchymal stromal cell ( AMSCs ) treatment variety diseases INDs . Thus far , treatment well tolerate . These data along investigator ' pre-clinical animal study publish experience use related approach lead investigator believe approach provide reasonable safety profile treat patient refractory painful knee OA . The purpose current study investigate safety feasibility single multiple injection autologous , culture expand AMSCs subject painful , refractory knee OA . Subjects unilaterally symptomatic mild severe knee OA enrol base satisfaction inclusion exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
