	<brief_summary>Main objective experiment threefold : 1 ) technically test device central blood pressure estimation applicability spaceflight-related environment International Space Station . 2 ) Furthermore objective compare central blood pressure estimate base arterial pressure reading different peripheral artery . For central blood pressure estimation mathematical transfer function describe Karamanoglu colleague ( 11 ) use . 3 ) Finally experiment ' objective simultaneously apply phonocardiography together ECG carotid plethysmography determine cardiac systolic time interval parabolic flight gravity transition . Secondary objective experiment simultaneously measure key variable central circulation gravity transition expand understand cardiovascular regulation weightlessness . Furthermore spirometric measurement shall perform parabolic flight day observe change end-expiratory CO2 . Arterial CO2 content central cardiovascular regulation . Our main hypothesis difference different method central arteria pressure determination . Concerning secondary objective , experiment design observational study . Thus clear hypothesis generate measured cardiovascular respiratory variable analyse regard difference correlate gravity .</brief_summary>
