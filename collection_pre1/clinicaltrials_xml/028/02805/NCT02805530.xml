	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) frequent neoplasm worldwide also represent main cause cancer death . However , represent main cause death cancer . The prognosis survival 5 year poor , approximately 13-15 % . The timely detection NSCLC difficult option curative treatment limit since majority patient diagnose advanced stage . The standard treatment metastatic disease cytotoxic chemotherapy platins ( cisplatin carboplatin ) combination third generation drug ( vinorelbine , paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine pemetrexed ) . This therapeutic scheme result response rate 20-30 % , mean overall survival 8-11 month . In recent year , research oncology focus development therapy aim molecular target control growth proliferation tumor cell . Various monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab , cetuximab ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( erlotinib , gefitinib , afatinib , crizotinib ) evaluate purpose NSCLC treatment . Clinical study advance NSCLC , use new drug without chemotherapy , favorable result increase progression-free survival response rate , without able demonstrate date , significant improvement overall survival . Various study suggest patient clinically present limited number metastasis , term define oligometastatic disease , could better prognosis survival radical treatment , counterpart great number metastasis . Much current medical information clinical outcome oligometastatic disease base clinical study retrospective case series institution . The majority report include mix patient synchronous metachronous oligometastatic disease , focus radical treatment specific sit brain adrenal gland . These result recognize European Society Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) include treatment guideline lung cancer ( 2012 ) . The recommendation state consider radical treatment select patient solitary metastasis . There limited information clinical benefit overall survival subgroup patient NSCLC clinically present synchronous oligometastatic disease equal le 5 synchronous metastasis time diagnosis . The purpose study add information current medical literature benefit overall survival radical treatment oligometastatic disease patient NSCLC equal less 5 synchronous metastasis time diagnosis . The outcome study determine global survival progression-free survival patient synchronous oligometastatic ( equal less 5 site ) advance NSCLC undergo radical treatment metastatic site primary tumor .</detailed_description>
