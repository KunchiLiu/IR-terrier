	<brief_summary>The ForConti Fecal Incontinence Management System ( FIMS ) indicate management accidental bowel leakage due bowel incontinence . The ForConti FIMS design self-insertion seal help prevent involuntary leakage stool , liquids gas rectum . The purpose study demonstrate ForConti FIMS safe improve management fecal incontinence improve quality life . Patients record bowel event daily diary 5 week period , include 1 week adjustment device use , 2 week without use device follow 2 week use device . Quality Life questionnaire complete use device . Stool leakage data collect device use compare data collect use device determine effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Evaluation ForConti Fecal Management System - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several device treat bowel incontinence . However , available device limit success . Sphincter bulk agent electrical stimulation demonstrate effectiveness clinical study . Anal plug show effectiveness associate discomfort pain . Hence , patient prefer use . The main reason pain discomfort current available anal plug plug location within anus dentate line . This part anus highly sensitive cause discomfort pain user . The advantage ForConti device design locate inner section anal canal , dentate line , much less sensitive thus cause discomfort user . This prospective , feasibility , non-randomized , single-arm , self-controlled study preliminary safety effectiveness . Total duration study patient 7 week , include follow-up . The study conduct 20 patient suffer accidental bowel leakage due bowel incontinence meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Following first 5 case , interim preliminary safety analysis conduct report submit Ministry Health approval continue study . Safety Endpoints : Primary : No device relate serious adverse event . Secondary : Minimal rate device procedure adverse event device use follow-up period . Effectiveness Endpoints : Demonstrate effectiveness system : A Relative Percentage Change Episodes Accidental Bowel Leakage ( ABL ) Determined Comparing Active Weeks Control Weeks Results measure Daily Diary Recordings . Secondary : QOL SUS Usability Survey Score Control Active period 2 week , account daily weekly variability subject bowel habit . The ForConti FIMS include 2 main part : insert part insertion system . The inserted part include balloon pull string insertion system include applicator inflator . The balloon flexible biocompatible , silicone-based , oval-shaped , furled component . It design locate rectum applicator fill pre-determined amount air gain final shape . The silicone surface equip silicone gag provide good sustainability rectum .</detailed_description>
