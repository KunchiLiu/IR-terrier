	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery gain currency field oncologic care , particularly colorectal gynecologic cancer . This innovation could use either stag purpose therefore could steer global therapeutic option surgical management . Increase knowledge skill lead increase number rate woman innovation could offer . The project team observe shift traditional surgical management ( abdominal radical surgery ) towards laparoscopic focus lymphadenectomy . This innovation however increase cost ( surgical stage ) decrease others ( post surgical stage ) . Foreseeing pace dissemination need objective reliable data access laparoscopic surgery n't ( ) accurate assessment relate cost . This program focus uterine cancer ( cervix corpus ) .</brief_summary>
