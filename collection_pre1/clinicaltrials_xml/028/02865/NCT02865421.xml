	<brief_title>Adipose Tissue Derived Stem Cell Based Hair Restoration Therapy Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgenetic alopecia ( AGA ) common form hair loss men woman , characterize progressive patterned loss hair scalp . The prevalence AGA increase significantly age , 30 % 50 % men affect age 30 50 year , respectively . 3 Further , woman also suffer different degree alopecia , 50 % woman affect age 60 . AGA become medical problem hair loss subjectively consider excessive , premature distressing . Current treatment option AGA include medication finasteride , dutasteride , spironolactone , flutamide , minoxidil etc . However , medicine suitable either men woman maintain exist hair effect hair regeneration . In addition treatment expensive require prolonged usage drug , treatment stop benefit gain lost . Therefore , good solution require stimulate hair follicle promote hair restoration sex long lasting effect . Recently , stem cell base therapy revolutionize field regenerative medicine provide treatment option several disease disorder . The current study design restoration hair AGA implant combination autologous mesenchymal stem cell ( derive adipose tissue ) human platelet rich plasma . The growth human hair extremely complex process . Hair growth begin skin structure call hair follicle . In AGA size hair follicles decrease due loss hair follicle stem progenitor cell result hair follicle become inactive . Due inactivation hair follicle large , pigment terminal hair replace barely visible de-pigmented vellus hair . External factor stimulate inactive hair follicle , result hair growth cycle begin . study indicate protein growth factor release stem cell play important role hair growth cycle . Considering fact , current study design possibility treatment AGA use combination autologous stem cell platelet rich plasma . In current study , Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) derive adipose tissue apply restore hair growth highly proliferate , multi-lineage differentiation potential , immunomodulatory immunosuppressive . Further , MSCs also secrete various growth factor proteins perform several function include hair follicle stimulation . Conventional approach hair refurbishment include medication hair follicle transplantation surgery . However , strategy mostly ineffective patient due drawback include high cost , several side effect , unsatisfactory result , requirement long lasting use medicine efficacy limit either male female . Therefore , contemporary therapy promise result require effective sex outcomes long last . MSC base treatment AGA open new avenue development therapy hair restoration . MSCs multiple effect miniaturize hair follicle home hair follicle paracrine effect . The study help patient hair loss also promote stem cell base regenerative medicine research Pakistan provide promising result .</detailed_description>
