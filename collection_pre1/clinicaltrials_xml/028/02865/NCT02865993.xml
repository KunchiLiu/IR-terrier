	<detailed_description>This single-centre randomized control trial perform Department Obstetrics Gynecology San Camillo Hospital Rome . The protocol approve Internal Review Board . All woman cesarean section ( CS ) eligible recruitment unless suspect know allergy iodine . The study widely publicize around obstetrics unit woman provide antenatally brief statement regard study . The study present woman part hospital initiative reduce postoperative infection improve postoperative recovery . Consent obtain woman time consent CS . Background record patient : maternal age , gestational week delivery , BMI , pregnancy complication ; plural fetal pregnancy , premature rupture membrane , placenta previa pre-eclampsia . The investigator record type cesarean procedure , elective ( schedule operation ) urgent ( patient labor maternal fetal emergent indication ) , mean surgical time perform CS . In Literature , povidone-iodine irrigation demonstrate simple inexpensive solution potential prevent surgical site infection , also reduce incidence intra-abdominal infectious complication use intraperitoneal irrigant patient undergo bacterially-contaminated surgical procedure , i.e . orthopedic , general surgery , oncologic surgery . Therefore , investigator aim test use CS . Patients intra-operatively randomized receive intraperitoneal irrigation prior abdominal closure low molecular weight povidone-iodine solution ( 'Betadine LMW ' ) ( PVP-I LMW ) dilute 50:50 normal saline normal saline solution . Randomization 'Betadine ' 'no Betadine ' group perform use sequentially number seal opaque envelope contain allocation . The allocation prepare use computer generate list random number use variable block 10 perform staff member , part clinical team . After layer suture prior start skin closure , envelope allocation open one theatre nurse . All CS generally perform spinal anesthesia specialist obstetrician , credentialed trainee registrar junior presence specialist obstetrician use modified Misgav Ladach surgical technique . An abdominal opening make straight transverse incision , place 3-4 cm symphysis . The subcutaneous tissue leave untouched apart midline . The rectus sheath separate along fiber rectus muscle separate pull . Stretching index finger open peritoneum uterus open index finger . The hole enlarge index finger one hand thumb . Single-layer closure uterine incision perform follow : hold Vicryl-0 place leave corner stabilize define demarcation suture line . A continuous non-locking stitch begin right corner use , close whole thickness uterine wall , exclude decidual layer , cranial/caudal position . Additional single suture add hemostasis require . Routinely exteriorization uterus perform . The visceral parietal peritoneal layer leave open rectus muscle stitch . The rectus sheath stitch continuous non-locking Vicryl-0 subdermal space close patient . All patient preoperative exams longer 4 week prior CS receive prophylactic intravenous antibiotic ( amoxicillin 2 g metronidazole 1 g ) preoperatively reduce rate wound infection . In addition , patient receive oxytocin intravenous CS 20 IU administer intravenous drip run post surgical procedure . All patient encourage start breastfeed early postoperative care , support midwife nurse specialize newborn care admission maternity ward . Post CS infection include : - Postpartum endometritis : defined clinical diagnosis , usually involve fever , uterine fundal tenderness , purulent lochia require antibiotic therapy . - Postoperative wound infection : define erythema , tenderness , purulent drainage incision site , without fever , require antibiotic therapy . - Postoperative fever : define great 38 degree C 100.4 degree F. - Postoperative wound seroma hematoma : define collection serous fluid blood/clot subcutaneous area incision . - Composite wound complication : define presence one following : wound infection , seroma , hematoma , separation . Patients examine daily round whilst hospital intestinal recanalization , postoperative mobilization , postoperative 24h post CS pain wound . Preoperative postoperative exam , presence fever symptom accurately register . After discharge hospital , woman send letter address return envelope report post CS problem four week surgery part hospital surveillance policy . Charts woman readmitted reason review . Differences 'Betadine ' 'no Betadine ' group assess use chi square categorical data test . Fisher 's exact test use 5 few count within category t-test continuous data . Relative risk ( RR ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
