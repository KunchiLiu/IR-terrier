Three age cohorts patient include study accord follow age range : 1 . ≥18 year old ( minimum 6 , maximum 18 patient ) 2 . &gt; 12 - 17 year old ( minimum 6 , maximum 18 patient ) 3 . &gt; 2 - 12 year old ( minimum 6 , maximum 18 patient ) The study close total 36 patient include among age group minimum number 6 patient reach age group . Before include paediatric population , minimum 6 adult patient complete treatment ass safety profile . A randomized list create determine side body ( left right ) subject apply medication ( SP14019-F-01 topical solution [ 5 % CsA ] SP14019-F-02 vehicle-control placebo solution ) . Solutions apply twice daily four complete week ( 28 day ) affect area . Photography use record evolution lesion Visits 0 ( pre-1st dose ) , Visits 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 follow-up . The main objective study : To assess efficacy SP14019-F-01 topical solution ( 5 % cyclosporine A [ CsA ] ) compare placebo topical solution treatment patient mild moderate atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . To evaluate safety tolerability SP14019-F-01 ( 5 % CsA ) topical solution patient mild moderate AD . A Steering Committee convene periodically maintain quality study conduct , discuss major issue concern particular attention critical event may lead stop recruitment . These critical event observation either new unexpected signal safety relate CsA . The Steering Committee also evaluate safety profile treatment include paediatric population</detailed_description>
