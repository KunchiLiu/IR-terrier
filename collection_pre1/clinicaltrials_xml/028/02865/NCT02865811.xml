	<brief_summary>This research study study combination Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin ( PLD ) Pembrolizumab possible treatment Recurrent Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Peritoneal Cancer resistant platinum therapy . The following intervention use study : - Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) - Pembrolizumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Combined With PLD For Recurrent Platinum Resistant Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The investigator look see combine standard therapy , PLD , study drug , Pembrolizumab , good PLD alone . Pembrolizumab drug call monoclonal antibody . Pembrolizumab block interferes protein call PD-1 ; PD-1 help cancer cell evade immune system , thereby block PD-1 may help immune system recognize kill cancer cell . This first time combination test participant Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Peritoneal Cancer . Therefore , group 6 participant treat `` safety lead '' portion trial . This lead determine safe dose PLD give combination study drug Pembrolizumab . These 6 participant treat Pembrolizumab PLD FDA approve dose see combination well tolerate severe . If combination well tolerate , 20 additional participant add . If side effect severe , dose PLD lower . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve PLD treatment option disease , approve Pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>

Have histologically confirm diagnosis epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube peritoneal cancer . All histology epithelial ovarian cancer eligible except carcinosarcoma . Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease contain carboplatin , cisplatin , another organoplatinum compound . This initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab ) extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment . Patients must platinum resistant cancer platinum free interval &lt; 6 month . Progression last platinum base investigator assessment . Patients allow receive , required receive , two additional cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent disease , 1 nonplatinum , nontaxane regimen . Patients allow receive , required receive , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) therapy part primary treatment regimen . For purpose study , Poly ( ADPribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor consider `` cytotoxic . '' Patients allow receive , required receive , PARP inhibitor management primary recurrent/persistent disease ( either alone combination cytotoxic chemotherapy ) . Single agent hormonal therapy count line treatment . Have adequate tissue archive specimen ovarian cancer ( 10 15 slide unstained tumor ) . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale ( Appendix A ) . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab must perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Table 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min participant creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN participant total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN participant liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ≤1.5 X ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant aCreatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Female participant childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female participant childbearing potential must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication . Participants childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Patients primary platinum refractory cancer , i.e . documented cancer progression receive platinum within one month receipt platinum base regimen . Has receive prior anthracycline chemotherapy either ovarian cancer treatment another previous malignancy . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) define multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) echocardiogram institutional low limit normal prior start study treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients and/or liposomal doxorubicin . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Participants &lt; Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If participant underwent major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . In addition , patient diagnose another malignancy within 3 year start treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Participants previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include clinically active significant carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment .
