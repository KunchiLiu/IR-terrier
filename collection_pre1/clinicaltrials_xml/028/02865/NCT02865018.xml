	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) autoimmune disease affect central nervous system . Patients relapse ( also know attack ) often quite severe leave significant disability . Without treatment , within 5 year 50 % NMO patient blind one eye require walk assistance ( cane , walker wheelchair ) . NMO relatively recently describe fairly rare . Most NMO patient ' immune system produce abnormal antibody aquaporin-4 ( AQP4 ) , find certain cell central nervous system . When AQP4 antibodies bind AQP4 , trigger cascade event involve immune system eventually lead damage nervous system . This ultimately lead disability , permanent . Until , treatment NMO mostly focus decrease production AQP4 antibody . However , recent experiment animal model NMO show importance happens inside central nervous system antibody bind nervous system cell . Specifically , researcher note importance specific cell type , eosinophil , cause damage NMO lesion . In recent study , researcher show could prevent damage NMO blocking eosinophil use cetirizine , popular over-the-counter allergy medicine . Cetirizine already know safe well-tolerated general population . In study , researcher plan add cetirizine patient ' current NMO treatment . The researcher aim show safe , well-tolerated , cetirizine , NMO patient less relapse therefore less disability course year follow initiation treatment . The researcher also plan study cetirizine change immunological profile NMO patient examine blood cerebrospinal fluid .</brief_summary>
