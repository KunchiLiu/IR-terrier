	<brief_title>Topical Tranexamic Acid Floseal® Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) associate considerable blood loss increase need allogenic blood transfusion . Previous study demonstrate transfusion rate range 10 % 38 % standard TKAs . Transfusion carry significant risk cardiopulmonary embarrassment , disease transmission , immunological reaction postoperative infection . The major cause postoperative blood loss follow TKA attribute surgery induces considerable activation coagulation cascade local fibrinolysis , latter enhance release tourniquet end surgery . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , inhibitor fibrinolysis , reportedly effective reduce blood loss standard TKA . Our previous experience minimally invasive ( MIS ) TKA show intraoperative infusion TXA reduce 45 % postoperative blood loss need transfusion 20 % 4 % . However , orthopedic surgeon still hesitate use TXA systemically TKAs especially high risk patient potential increase thromboembolic event follow surgery . A recent study Nishihara et al demonstrate use TXA total hip arthroplasty appear affect prevalence either proximal DVT PE . Another study Xie J et al also show incidence postoperative VTE unchanged TXA administer primary unilateral TKA , study total occurrence vascular occlusive event statistically significantly high ( 17.55 % Vs 9.35 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) TXA group . However , two study patient high risk thromboembolic event ( ischemic heart disease , chronic renal failure hemodialysis , cerebral infarction , previous VTE disease , thrombophilia associate genetic disease ) exclude . We believe topical use hemostatic agent patient high risk thromboembolism avoid systematic effect decrease potential perioperative risk thromboembolic complication ( arterial thrombosis , myocardial infarction pulmonary embolism ) . Recently , report demonstrate cost-effectiveness topical application TXA TKA patient . Besides , thrombin-based hemostatic agent , Floseal® , widely use surgical procedure include gynecology , general surgery , orthopedics still attract attention interest multitudinous surgeon . Some recent study demonstrate topic use Floseal® primary TKA reduce hemoglobin decline calculate total blood loss TKA related adverse reaction complication wound infection , venous thromboembolism event ( VTE ) . But another study show Floseal® reduce blood loss TKA procedures . Our purpose study therefore conduct prospective randomize control trial investigate blood-conservation effect two topic hemostatic agent safety primary TKA procedures patient risk thromboembolic event . The first group topical TXA application , second group topical Floseal® application , third group placebo observe whether difference blood-conservation effect total blood loss calculation , hemoglobin loss transfusion requirement among patient group .</detailed_description>
