	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect Traxi Pannus retractor obese patient ( BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) undergo Cesarean section compare routine pannus retraction technique . Patients randomize use Traxi retractor Cesarean section ( treatment group ) use traditional pannus retraction technique ( control group ) . The primary outcome follow surgical site disruption . The investigator also assess duration surgery length time skin incision delivery infant , change hemoglobin , estimate blood loss , postoperative length stay , need hospital readmission emergency room visit , complication rate two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Self-Retaining Pannus Retractor Obese Patients Undergoing Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) important cause morbidity follow cesarean section . The rate surgical site infection follow cesarean section United States estimate 3-15 % , depend population study , definition surgical site infection use , length time study often underestimated . Morbidities include long length hospital stay , hospital readmission , wound open re-exploration , need home health care , increase health care cost loss productivity . The risk develop SSI Cesarean section increase certain patient characteristic , obesity duration surgery decrease use prophylactic antibiotic prior skin incision . Obesity significant public health problem incidence continue increase United States . It show associate increase risk SSI cesarean section several study . Olsen et al review 1,605 patient underwent cesarean section find increase BMI admission independent risk factor SSI . In another study 19,416 woman Israel cesarean delivery , woman BMI ≥30 kg/m2 increase risk infection ( odds ratio [ OR } =2.2 ; 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] . Leth , et al . also find obesity risk factor associate wound infection . In study 2,492 consecutive woman cesarean section Denmark , infection rate increase increase BMI , woman BMI kg/m2 30.0-34.9 infection rate 19.1 % woman BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2 ≥40 kg/m2 infection rate 31.1 % . Hypotheses increase rate wound infection obese patient include decreased vascularity adipose tissue , increase wound area , poor penetration prophylactic antibiotic adipose tissue . Adequate surgical exposure good visualization paramount abdominal surgery . Retraction pannus cephalad often required adequate visualization access low abdomen thus low uterine segment . Several study show pfannensteil joel-cohen incision superior vertical incision due increase risk classical cesarean delivery case obese gravida . Limited study complete assess supra umbilical incision . Other method pannus retraction currently utilized obstetrics surgery , mostly surgical tape Montgomery strap . However , currently clinical trial compare type pannus retractor . Potential benefit Traxi retractor decrease operating time , decrease need additional operating room personnel , increase ease delivery neonate . In addition , Traxi design stay 24 hour order elevate pannus , decrease exposure moisture possibly bacteria skin begin heal .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pregnant woman BMI great equal 30 kg/m square , age 1450 year old , undergoing nonemergent cesarean section delivery require pannus displacement surgery . Physicians Inclusion would include physician routinely perform Csections Patients undergoing emergency Cesareansection Preexisting concurrent infection include chorioamnionitis State immunosuppression ( ie . HIV , cancer ) Longterm steroid use ( &gt; 2 day ) Patients BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 , BMI &gt; /=30kg require pannus retraction . If rash area retraction Adhesive/tape allergy . Physicians exclusion would include physician routinely perform Csections .</criteria>
