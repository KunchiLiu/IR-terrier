	<brief_summary>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) prevalent genetic disorder define high cholesterol level premature death . The prevalence FH report country however unknown Iran . Thus determine FH patient , find diagnostic strategy appropriate treatment important . We intent use cascade method screen patient , also expect output develop implement registry program FH patient family study genetic disorder . FH patient follow management , treatment prevention Cardio vascular disease order increase premature death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Implementing Familial Hypercholesterolemia Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) genetic disorder define high cholesterol level , particularly high level low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , blood early cardiovascular disease premature death . FH autosomal dominant disease prevalence 1:500 ( new study Netherlands demonstrate 1:244 ) population frequent Cystic fibrosis , mellitus diabetes neonatal hypothyroidism . Canadian registry demonstrate FH common among people French Canadian , Christian Lebanese , Afrikaner descent . The Major cause FH pathogenic variant LDL-receptor ( LDLR ) gene Apo lipoprotein B ( APOB ) gene . The clinical sign FH high level Cholesterol ( 350-550 mg/dL heterozygous ) , Yellow deposit cholesterol-rich fat various place body around eyelid ( know xanthelasma palpebrarum ) , outer margin iris ( know arcus senilis cornea ) , tendon hand , elbow , knee foot , particularly Achilles tendon ( know tendon xanthoma ) . FH hidden syndrome lead cardiovascular disease . After introduce statin total mortality reduce significantly patient . Thus screen identification patient treatment effective therapy decrease risk premature death . Also , patient require appropriate lipid-lowering medication . Although genetic problem important factor expression FH factor like environmental metabolic factor effective CVD premature death . Therefore , identification follow-up FH patient important CVD Rate cut decrease Treatment cost thus study gain outcome .</detailed_description>
