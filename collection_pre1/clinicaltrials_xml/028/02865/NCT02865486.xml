	<brief_summary>In randomize , double blind , unbalance three way crossover trial , four lipid emulsion assess three study day . The lipid emulsion ( LEs ) engineer differ term acid stability , lipid droplet size fat redispersibility . The investigator hypothesize gastric empty fat differ lipid emulsion . An optional study day ( visit 5 ) use assess degree lipolysis Lipid emulsion 5 ( LE5 ) Lipid emulsion 6 ( LE6 ) . This study day randomize , single blind study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The physical state fat demonstrate affect rate fat digestion . By engineering physical property lipid emulsion investigator able alter characteristic acid stability , lipid droplet size fat redispersibility . These factor show modulate physical state fat stomach , subsequent fat gastric empty digestion well satiation healthy subject . The investigator recently develop new series lipid emulsion base biopolymers . Preliminary animal study show emulsion able effect GI physiology include GI peptide hormone eat behavior . The primary aim work apply biopolymer base lipid emulsion healthy subject investigate impact fat digestion satiation . A secondary aim develop image analysis method quantify heterogeneity fat distribution within gastric content MRI data . The participant ( n=17 ) randomize screen receive 3 4 lipid emulsion ( LE ) . On three study day subject receive 200 mL lipid emulsion . MRI scan perform regular interval period 3.5 h. Blood sample ( GI peptide hormone analysis ) also take regular interval 5 h post LE ingestion . Further , 13C breath test sample obtain participant every 10 min 5 h post ingestion LE . Throughout entire 5 h study period participant ask score visceral sensation relation satiation . Once technical section study complete participant provide ad libitum buffet consume much little food option provide buffet . Optional study day : After main study complete MRI data analyze study unblinded . This enable investigator optimize MR image gastric content sample schedule LE5 LE6 . The participant ( n=17 ) randomize 10 subject give opportunity participate optional study day . The optional study day single blind consist 1 extra visit maximum 3 h duration . No blood , breath test sample visceral sensation score take . Subjects arrive fast nasogastric tube position . 200 mL either LE5 LE6 contain 13C breath test marker infuse . MR image continue define interval maximum 3 h. In total five gastric content sample 5 mL take nasogastric tube .</detailed_description>
