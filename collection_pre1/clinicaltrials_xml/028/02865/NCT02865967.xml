	<brief_title>Developing Implementing Asthma-Guidance Prediction System ( a-GPS ) Better Asthma Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite availability evidence-based guideline asthma management effective asthma therapy , asthma continue cause significant morbidity burden society . Growing deployment Electronic Health Records ( EHRs ) system establish large practice-based longitudinal datasets , allow identification patient cohorts epidemiological investigation population-based management . Natural Language Processing ( NLP ; automate chart review use computer program ) receive great attention play critical role secondary use EHRs clinical care translational research . For example , recently develop NLP algorithm Predetermined Asthma Criteria ( PAC ) ascertain asthma status without manual chart review . The primary goal propose clinical trial 1 ) implement asthma-Guidance Prediction System ( a-GPS ) Asthma Management Program ( AMP , current care coordination program asthma care child age 5-17 year Mayo Clinic ) 2 ) assess impact a-GPS primary secondary end point one-year study period . These goal accomplish conduct randomized clinical trial block design three group child group ( block ) child significantly heterogeneous term receive asthma care . The a-GPS program include 1 ) natural language processing ( NLP ) capability ( i.e. , automate EHR review identify asthma status ( yes vs. ) monitor asthma activity ( onset , remission , relapse ) real time ) , 2 ) temporal geospatial trend analysis asthma outcome care , 3 ) asthma care optimization predictive analytics . The primary end point include asthma outcome use quarterly measure age-appropriate asthma control questionnaire ( ie , Asthma Control Test ( ACT ; validate child age ≥ 4 year ) score child ≥ 4 year : total duration ACT score &gt; 19 , Test Respiratory Asthma Control Kids ( TRACK ; validate child 5 year ) score child &lt; 4 year : total duration TRACK score &lt; 80 ) , care quality ( timely care response asthma-related event ) , cost ( total cost per member ) . For Block 3 , rate physician diagnosis asthma study also compare intervention control group measure quality care .</detailed_description>
