	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) prevalent form arthritis report important reason behind functional disability musculoskeletal disorder among aged individual . OA `` total joint failure ; represent pathological damage articular cartilage , affect bone , meniscus , synovium , ligament , neuromuscular tissue '' . Knee OA could responsible pain functional disability 19.2 % individual age 45 year Framingham study 27.8 % individual Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project . However , third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , nearly 37 % individual age 60 year old radiographic knee OA . Oliveria et al . ( 1995 ) report age- sex-standardized incidence rate symptomatic hip , knee , hand OA 88 , 240 , 100/100,000 person-years , respectively . In addition , incidence rate symptomatic OA knee , hand , hip increase rapidly age 50 level beyond age 70 . There enough data report prevalence OA Arabic country . However , cross-sectional study perform Saudi Arabia demonstrate radiographic knee OA 53.3 % men 60.9 % woman , 18 % woman 10 % men symptomatic OA . Although well establish OA mainly cause damage occur joint degeneration inflammation , know cure OA understand pathological aetiology OA still deficient poorly understood . The primary objective study investigate immediate carry-over effect MWM pain function patient knee OA . A secondary objective evaluate effect among patient demonstrate feature central sensitization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Mobilization With Movement Pain Function Among Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : A power analysis perform use G*Power 3.1 ( F test , analysis variance [ ANOVA ] : repeat measure , within-between interaction , priori : compute required sample size ) . A result 16 patient ( treatment group = 8 sham group = 8 ) use calculate effect size ( ES ) 0.27 pressure pain threshold knee intervention group . The power estimate ANOVA two group significance 0.05 revealed total sample size 27 patient necessary obtain power 0.80 . Considering 20 % attrition rate , minimum 18 patient need recruit first phase study . Patients knee OA attend King Fahd Hospital University recruit study . Patients diagnose orthopedic clinic refer Department Physiotherapy . Patients willing participate study screen eligibility Ethical consideration : The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University Dammam ( IRB Number : IRB-2014-04-323 ) . Eligible individual study inform risk benefit ask read sign write consent form . Participant confidentiality maintain use code instead participant 's name data collection form . All data collection form save file secure locker . Only researcher supervisor key open locker . Statistical Analysis : Data analyze use International Business Machines ( IBM ) Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) windows ( version 20.0 ) , significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . In phase 1 , patient characteristic group baseline analyze use independent t-test . One way ANOVA repeat measure use analyze difference parametric data , Bonferroni adjustment use compare main effect . Post-hoc test perform reveal difference within- group time ( baseline , immediately post intervention , 2 day intervention ) . For Likert-scale WOMAC , Mann-Whitney U test use investigate between-group analysis . Whereas , Wilcoxon test use within-group analysis . Further analysis reveal correlation outcome measure investigate use Pearson Correlation test . In phase 2 , group match age , gender , BMI . The related t-test use investigate difference group .</detailed_description>
