	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve injury result number cortical change due lack sensory motor stimulus . Although functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study reveal change cortical activation exist , cortical activation change obstetrical brachial plexus injury poorly know . For reason , aim study investigate cortical activity rest stimulation fMRI patient OBPI . Patients OBPI diagnosis cervical 5-6 ( C5-6 ) ( upper trunk ) follow Gazi University Faculty Health Sciences Department Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Division Hand Rehabilitation participate study . Patients surgery history least 5 year ago 10 year age include . Clinical motor sensory assessment perform help explain analysis cortical activation . In first visit , clinical assessment include Active Movement Scale , modify Mallet Classification ( MMC ) sensory test perform ; fMRI scan carried second visit . Patients scan 3 paradigm one single fMRI session : rest sensory stimulation watch video motor movement . Video image include 5 movement use MMC watch glass integrate MRI device . Images obtain MR scan analyzed analysis program like Leonardo , Fresurfer , SPM , BrainVoyager clinical result compare MR image .</detailed_description>
