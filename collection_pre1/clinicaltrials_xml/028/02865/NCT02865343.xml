Thirty individual high level SCI FES-row train least 6 month randomize ( continue ) FES-RT 4 month either NIV sham NIV . Before training , investigator assess maximal aerobic capacity , ventilation , cardiac output , arterio-venous oxygen difference . Based investigator current data , hypothesize randomized NIV experience increase aerobic capacity increase relate increase cardiac output arterio-venous oxygen difference .

	<brief_title>Ventilatory Support Improve Exercise Training High Level Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular aerobic exercise sufficient intensity improve overall health , however daily energy expenditure low SCI , especially high level lesion . We develop Functional Electrical Stimulation Row Training ( FESRT ) couple volitional arm electrically control leg exercise , increase active muscle result benefit large muscle mass exercise . Despite potential enhancing aerobic capacity , high level lesion ( C4 T2 ) remain obstacle attain high work capacity greatest pulmonary muscle denervation preliminary work suggest limit aerobic capacity achieve FESRT . External ventilatory support could improve ability exercise train hence enhance adaptation chronic exercise high level SCI . Non invasive ventilation ( NIV ) exercise train show improve gain exercise capacity similarly restrictive breathing . Therefore , investigator hypothesize use NIV FESRT reduce ventilatory limit exercise , lead increase aerobic capacity high level SCI . Our aim determine magnitude improvement aerobic capacity relationship increase maximal cardiac output arterio venous oxygen difference 4 month FESRT+NIV compare FESRT+shamNIV . The investigator access large ( N &gt; 70 ) unique population individual SCI enrol FESRT least 6 month . Roughly half SCI C4 T2 . 30 individual high level SCI FES row train least 6 month randomize ( continue ) FESRT 4 month either NIV sham NIV . Before training , investigator assess maximal aerobic capacity , ventilation , cardiac output , arterio venous oxygen difference . Based current data , hypothesize randomized NIV experience increase aerobic capacity increase relate increase cardiac output arterio venous oxygen difference . This Exploratory/Developmental Research project determine feasibility effectiveness approach exercise lay groundwork large , control trial .</detailed_description>
