	<brief_summary>It observe target fortification different schedule lead meal meal variation . It change ratio protein energy percentage carbohydrate non-protein energy may , affect growth . In past , investigator analyze outcome breast milk composition target fortification do different analysis schedule . The investigator able measure macronutrient intake different milk analysis schedule via theoretical model show frequent schedule reduce variation fortified-breast milk , whereas reduce schedule lead high variation macronutrients . It observe , breast milk sample measure twice per week , infant achieve average recommended macronutrients line current recommendation . Nonetheless , model look macronutrient intake investigates relationship macronutrient variation effect growth . The aim current study compare frequent schedule measurement macronutrient analysis reduce schedule measurement study affect growth , protein accretion metabolic parameter .</brief_summary>
