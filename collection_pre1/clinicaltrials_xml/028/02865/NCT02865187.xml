	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder among reproductive age woman prevalence high 15 % use Rotterdam diagnostic criteria.1 PCOS heterogeneous clinical disorder characterize primarily chronic anovulation hyperandrogenism.2 A number metabolic health complication associate PCOS include obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , endometrial cancer.3 The clinical symptom PCOS include menstrual dysfunction , infertility , hirsutism , alopecia , acne , possible increase risk diabetes cardiovascular disease report significant contributor psychological morbidity impact health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) 4,5 include depression anxiety,6,7 suicide attempts,8 body dissatisfaction,9 eat disorders,10 low overall health-related quality life11 diminish sexual satisfaction.12,13 For woman PCOS , change physical appearance associate mood disorder appear deleterious sexual function.6 Previous research area scant , do reveals large number woman PCOS ( 60 % ) report sexual dysfunction domain desire arousal commonly affect ( 98 % - 99 % case ) . Using Changes Sexual Functioning Questionnaire ( CSFQ ) , others report woman PCOS similar control woman number sexual thought fantasy frequency sexual intercourse , differ significantly low orgasm/completion score control women.13 The exist research limit study population use , consist infertile woman PCOS high prevalence sexual dysfunction may relate infertility underlie sexual dysfunction , possible impact depression psychotropic medication sexual dysfunction . Vitamin D deficiency ( &lt; 20 ng/ml serum concentration 25 [ OH ] D ) , affect 67 % 85 % women,4 closely link symptom PCOS . Observational study show low 25 [ OH ] D level associate insulin resistance , ovulatory menstrual irregularity , low pregnancy success , hirsutism , hyperandrogenism , obesity , elevate cardiovascular disease risk factors14 well decrease HRQoL depression select populations.15 Nonetheless , limit research explore implication vitamin D status replacement HRQoL issue include SDy . The main physiologic role vitamin D regulate calcium phosphorus homeostasis promote bone health . However , accumulate evidence suggest vitamin D deficiency may also important factor many disease . Several mechanisms action propose explain association vitamin D depression . The role calcitriol 1,25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol , bioactive form vitamin D , brain tissue confirm presence vitamin D receptor ( VDRs ) hydroxylases various brain region . One area VDRs hydroxylases find amygdala , center limbic system , behavior emotion regulated.16 In addition , Vitamin D involve numerous brain process include neuroimmunomodulation , regulation neurotrophic factor , neuroprotection , neuroplasticity brain development,16 make biologically plausible vitamin D might associate HRQoL SDy . Although increase awareness importance sexual dysfunction QoL woman PCOS , study evaluate outcomes treatment PCOS upon sexual subjective health status woman . Therapy direct treat physical symptom produce chronic anovulation , hyperandrogenism metabolic disturbance associate insulin resistance PCOS . Treatment PCOS include oral hypoglycemic agent , laparoscopic wedge resection , cosmetic procedure , laser hair removal , mainstay remains combined hormonal contraception . The specific contribution estrogens progestogens oral contraceptive fully understood , particularly latter variable potency androgenicity . In general , commonly use progestin 19-testosterone derivative . Newer oral contraceptive , drospirenone , norgestimate , desogestrel , contain less androgenic progestin . Drospirenone 17-alpha spironolactone derivative progestin antiandrogenic antimineralocorticoid activity . Studies show various benefit combine hormonal contraceptive PCOS patient pursue fertility , e.g. , management endocrine metabolic profile , androgen level , endometrial cancer.5 Vitamin D supplementation also report improve glucose metabolism menstrual frequency PCOS women17 since Vitamin D deficiency closely link PCOS depression , supplementation suggest possibly play important part treatment PCOS HRQoL perhaps SDy.18 As , goal study evaluate prevalence sexual dysfunction assess impact treatment use oral contraceptive Vitamin D SDy absence depression . The investigator anticipate may provide new treatment strategy SDy issue woman PCOS . METHODS : The study enroll 60 woman diagnose PCOS report SDy Wright State Physicians ( WSP ) OB-GYN Practice WSP Family Medicine Practice . All participant take vitamin D 600IU/day ( recommend National Institutes Health 's Office Dietary Supplements ) choose hormonal non-hormonal contraceptive method ( target 30 participant group ) . Participants complete three study visit ( Initial , Month 3 , Month 6 ) . Vitamin D level draw begin study 3 6 month initiation vitamin D therapy . Each participant ask complete Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) prior initiation treatment 6 month . HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION : The PI responsible protection human subject . This protocol review WSU Institutional Review Board . Only subject meet study eligibility criterion enrol . All eligible participant study explain . The informed consent process conduct appropriately inform consent obtain prior proceed study procedure . The primary physician Principal Investigator research associate individual obtain informed consent patient . They uniform explanation nature study patient fit selection criterion . Those patient interested participate give time read inform consent . The patient ask either clinic involved study . After informed consent review patient remain question answer . Adverse event review evaluate PI throughout study . In event additional diagnosis obtain study , primary physician patient notify . It responsibility notify patient diagnosis change management may result . Subjects ' confidentiality protect . Participants assign unique identification ( ID ) number study use data collection form rather subject ' name . Only minimum data necessary conduct study meet objective collect . Data store secure database ( REDCap19 ) use unique username password team member . Data de-identified prior analysis . SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY IN RELATION TO HUMAN HEALTH ( BENEFITS ) : PCOS common reproductive endocrine disorder number health quality life issue . The benefit study identify SDy often overlook may potentially help Vit D and/or birth control . POTENTIAL HAZARDS ( RISKS ) : The study questionnaire may evoke stressful feeling take psychosocial questionnaire . In addition , rare potential risk relate OCPs include deep venous thrombosis , stroke . Serious side effect vitamin D include allergic reaction , swell face , throat , tongue , dizziness , irregular race heart beat , dry mouth , headache , vomit , weakness lack energy , fatigue The risk take blood include pain , bruise point blood take , redness swell vein infection , rare risk fainting .</detailed_description>
