	<brief_summary>This study address `` lifespan approach healthy development age '' direct relevance human test anti-aging effect acarbose human . It pilot study : ) good estimate power large trial , ii ) establish safety potential beneficial effect acarbose non-diabetic elderly human , iii ) determine whether effect acarbose microbiome likely play role enhancement longevity and/or healthy age . These essential initial step translate acarbose anti-aging human therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acarbose Anti-aging Effects Geriatric Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment acarbose , α-glucosidase inhibitor , extend median lifespan 22 % male mouse . Acarbose FDA-approved use human extensively employed management diabetic ; associate side effect report . Acarbose consider safe treatment . Thus , investigator hypothesize acarbose treatment could use elderly human elicit improvement system know negatively affected age . Since outcome acarbose treatment may differentially affected age , imperative test drug directly old subject safety efficacy . Towards end , investigator propose perform small pilot study assess effect acarbose ten elderly subject , age 75-95 year old . Briefly , cohort non-diabetics recruit ; subject generally good health chronic disease ( hypertension , coronary artery disease , etc . ) clinically stable . Trial participant study drug initiation ( pre-treatment ) , 3 month acarbose ( blood draws 1 month 3 month treatment ) , follow termination drug ( 1 3 month post treatment ) subject serve control . The follow assess : 1 ) acarbose safety , include physical examination , clinical blood work , self-reporting discomfort symptom , SF36 questionnaires ; 2 ) Endothelial function improve acarbose ; 3 ) Physical function ( grip strength walk speed ) ; 4 ) Cognitive function ; 5 ) Immune parameter know change age ; include cytokine profile , regulatory t-cell number , CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio , naïve/memory T cell ratio ; 6 ) Gut microbiome composition investigator predict change oral acarbose treatment , potentially contribute positive effect lifespan .</detailed_description>
