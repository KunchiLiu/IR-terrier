	<brief_summary>Poor function right side heart rise pressure blood vessel lead lung two main heart-related factor associate worsen airway disease . A relatively new method use magnetic field create image heart call cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging show immense promise detailed accurate assessment heart patient airway disease . This project aim assess heart patient asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) well healthy participant use CMR help u determine feature CMR different patient asthma COPD compare healthy participant . This may help early identification patient risk episode acute worsen airway disease , call exacerbation , potentially halt progression heart dysfunction currently available new treatment . Study involve one visit Glenfiled Hospital , Leicester , last approximately 4 hour . The visit include follow assessment : clinical history , health status , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood test , lung function testing , echocardiogram CMR . Part study involve participant questionnaire participant rate CMR experience . The result potentially change way CMR undertaken . A sub-set participant also invite back one focus group discuss CMR experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Heart Dysfunction Pulmonary Hypertension Evaluation Airway Disease Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Importance : Chronic respiratory disease , include asthma , COPD pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , responsible 4.2 million death globally 2008 . COPD asthma affect 500 million people worldwide present enormous health economic burden . Exacerbations airway disease contribute disease progression represent substantial proportion acute hospital admission . Early identification patient risk event therefore important . There unclear distinction two airway disease , particularly severe form evidence heterogeneity . Right ventricular dysfunction ( RVD ) PH secondary lung disease and/or hypoxia recognise important element chronic airway disease pathogenesis play important role development frequent comorbidities . There data suggest pulmonary artery dilatation COPD patient associate increased risk exacerbation . This indicate cardiovascular factor addition airway inflammation may associate exacerbation airway disease . Development RVD PH COPD patient also associate poor exercise tolerance.RVD see development PH cor pulmonale COPD . This underpin importance early diagnosis may improve overall survival quality life . Clinical diagnosis PH chronic airway disease often difficult , particularly mild form due similarity clinical presentation . Other method diagnosis RVD PH echocardiography right heart catheterisation ( RHC ) . The echocardiographic measurement show lack sensitivity specificity patient COPD RHC invasive test , risk complication . Cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image provide excellent alternative diagnosis RVD PH . CMR non-invasive test , free ionize radiation CMR morphometric index dramatically low inter-observer intra-observer variability test-retest reproducibility compare echocardiography . There paucity information value CMR Group 3 PH . It also unclear whether PH play role severe asthma patient airway inflammation airflow limitation comparable COPD patient . Study Participants : The investigator plan recruit total 86 participant study . Adult asthma COPD subject airflow limitation ( FEV1 % predict &lt; 80 % ) recruit study . Healthy participant past history cardiovascular respiratory disease also recruit . The investigator plan recruit 33 participant ( n=13 FEV1 % predict &lt; 50 % , n=20 FEV1 % predict ≥ 50 % &lt; 80 % ) group airway disease ( COPD asthma ) 20 healthy participant . Study Assessments : Participants undergo follow assessment day visit : 1 . Clinical History Clinical history record do routinely clinic , include date birth , gender , disease duration , age onset , medical condition , smoke history , occupational history , severe exacerbation last one year ( require use steroid tablet emergency hospital visit ) treatment . 2 . Health status disease control questionnaires ( Only Airway Disease Participants ) Participants ask complete routine health status disease control questionnaires . 3 . Focused physical examination Participant 's height weight measure . Pulse oximetry also perform . Pulse oximetry non-invasive method measure oxygen level blood place sensor device person 's body , usually fingertip earlobe . 4 . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) An ECG perform participant . 5 . Blood test Blood obtain follow : ( 1 ) assessment protein secrete heart chamber response excessive stretch heart muscle , ( 2 ) full blood count [ FBC ] ( 3 ) urea electrolytes [ U &amp; E ] ( 4 ) storage plasma extract blood biomarker ( characteristic biological property molecule detect blood indicate normal diseased process body ) analysis future date complement similar ethically approve research University Leicester / University Hospitals Leicester United Kingdom international academic partner . The plasma store anonymously -80°C indefinitely NIHR Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit . 6 . Spirometry Lung function participant assess use spirometry ( breathe test ) . 7 . Echocardiogram A focussed test perform measure pressure pulmonary artery 8 . Cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging After identification position heart use localisers follow sequence obtain : ( ) Cine Imaging : Biventricular volume , function mass . Interventricular septum leave ventricle eccentricity index calculate . Pulmonary artery ( PA ) stiffness pulsatility assess measure relative area change pulmonary trunk cardiac cycle . ( ii ) Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Cardiac output flow profile determine . ( iii ) Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) Contrast-enhanced MRA acquire assess pulmonary vascular tree accurately quantify dimension assess angiogram pattern pulmonary vascular tree . ( iv ) Late Gadolinium Enhancement ( LGE ) T1-weighted inversion recovery gradient echo image acquire approximately 15-20 minute intravenous injection gadolinium base contrast agent . Degree LGE insertion point interventricular septum assess . ( v ) Myocardial T1 map T1-mapping sequence base Modified Look-Locker Inversion-recovery ( MOLLI ) technique use assessment myocardial fibrosis . 9 . CMR survey A questionnaire give participant CMR scan find experience examination .</detailed_description>
