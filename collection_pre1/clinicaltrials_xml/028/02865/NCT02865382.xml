	<brief_title>Detection Colorectal Adenoma Optical Enhancement Technology vs. High-Definition Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common cancer world.Colonoscopy gold standard screen test colorectal cancer.There also emerge data support screen colonoscopy reduces incidence mortality colorectal cancer.However , Colonoscopy could still miss colorectal adenoma even cancer.The miss rate colonic adenoma report range 15 32 % tandem colonoscopy studies.The reason miss rate may technical ( insufficient excessively fast instrument withdrawal ) , may also image method.Smaller lesion , particularly flat one , may miss result subtle appearance limit contrast relation surround mucosa . Some image-enhanced module develop aim improve colorectal polyp adenoma detection.The widely available module narrow band imaging ( NBI ) .However , study fail demonstrate superiority NBI system white light colonoscopy detect colonic polyps.NBI provide dim image colonic mucosa , may limit performance polyp adenoma detection . Like NBI , OE technology image-enhanced module , provide intense look vascular pattern morphology.Besides , OE technology provide much bright image compare NBI.This may possibly increase polyp detection enhance visibility colonic mucosa brighter image.The current study aim test whether OE technology would improve adenoma detection compare high-definition colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
