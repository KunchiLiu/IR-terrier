	<detailed_description>Neuroplasticity , i.e . human brain 's innate capacity structurally remodel functionally reorganize neural network , essential recovery impair sensorimotor function focal ischemic injury . However , potential spontaneous recovery adult brain limit need augment rehabilitative program , e.g . intensive exercise , brain stimulation pharmacologic neuromodulation . Clinical study show post-stroke recovery augment long-term administration selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) . Serotonin modulate excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission induces long-term potentiation ( LTP ) , important mediator neuroplasticity support sensorimotor learn healthy brain reorganization post-stroke perilesional cortex . Preliminary data indicate single dose SSRI Escitalopram sufficient induce LTP-like effect motor cortex healthy volunteer ( measure repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) ) , increase efficiency large-scale functional connectivity network engage tactile object manipulation ( measure functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ) . The investigator thus hypothesize serotonergic neuromodulation might enhance post-stroke recovery enlarge plasticity processing efficiency along integrated neuronal network , lead reinforce connectivity behavioural performance . To test hypothesis , investigator aim conduct longitudinal , double blind , placebo-controlled trial two neurological center . The investigator aim test effect daily-administered single dose Escitalopram three month period cortical ischemic stroke promote plasticity change perilesional zone primary sensorimotor cortex ( S1 M1 ) . The investigator apply behavioural measure hand function , rTMS advance magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technique outcome variable . The investigator measure hand function kinematics data glove good understand contribution effort hand function recovery brain activation . Moreover , investigator intend apply MR-Spectroscopy perilesional premotor cortex , guide real-time fMRI analysis , tool assess local glutamatergic transmission . Measurements plasma drug level determination genetic polymorphism Escitalopram-metabolizing gene help assess control interindividual variance Escitalopram bioavailability . The investigator expect SSRI-augmented neuroplasticity lead increase efficiency allocation neuronal resource post-stroke brain , result precise less effortful movement , facilitation LTP-like phenomenon , increase grey matter volume spar perilesional premotor cortex possibly higher glutamate peak area , compare placebo treatment . By combine standard innovative method , study provide mechanistic insight process drive cortical neuroplasticity post-stroke human brain . From clinical perspective , result study expect provide scientific rationale select patient might benefit SSRI-augmented neurorehabilitation .</detailed_description>
