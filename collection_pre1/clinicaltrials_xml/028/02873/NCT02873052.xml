	<brief_title>MyoVista Measurements Patients With Atherosclerosis CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MyoVista iECG Electrocardiograph diagnostic device use process electrical signal transmit electrocardiograph electrode detect ischemia abnormality base electrical waveform , patient data , demographic , algorithmic sensitivity software base informatics . The MyoVista provide clinician standard ECG conventional waveform , along additional report derive proprietary informatics exclusive MyoVista . The device hold lot promise early intervention properly diagnose treat patient risk timely effectively . The MyoVista capture amplifies signal myocardial tissue . These signal process compare algorithm look certain change occur processed waveform . The change identify occur much sooner process traditional electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . These recording focus early detection myocardial abnormality non-linear analysis electrical activity physiological phenomenon . This novel assessment might capable detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction variety heart diseases . The study would compare MyoVista result subclinical measure atherosclerosis ( CAC CT angiography ) 200 subject risk coronary disease . Correlations MyoVista read presence calcify plaque , soft plaque , CTA stenosis , determine . This study potential confirm MyoVista reliable sensitive marker atherosclerosis . Findings may provide strong indication value MyoVista test confirm CAD clinical practice , clinical application MyoVista management coronary disease atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
