	<brief_title>Incentive Spirometry Non-critically Ill Hospitalized Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year focus medicine shift towards efficient utilization resource improve patient outcome . Incentive spirometry ( IS ) tool mimic natural process yawn sigh allow user take deep breath control set . This lung inflate maneuver suggest decrease rate pulmonary complication . The focus utilization IS current study predominantly post-operative surgical patient population . The mechanism pulmonary complication surgical patient mixed etiology possibly related anesthesia , analgesic , pain immobility lead shallow breathing subsequent atelectasis concurrent hypoxia risk infection . The use lung expand maneuver provide IS think counteract shallow breathe thereby improve pulmonary outcome . However , contrary physiological theory , multiple study meta-analysis fail demonstrate efficacy . The result study direct conflict expect scientifically . The author paper set find reason discordant data exist literature , find multiple methodological limitation associate exist study ; hence , interpretation recommendation base current data do caution . The common denominator repeat criticism exist study lack report patient compliance IS prescribe . This major confounder , clinical experience IS often observe sit dormant patient ' bedside . These observation synchrony criticism report literature raise serious question validity exist data acknowledge . Despite lack convincing evidence , IS routinely prescribe physician hospital medicine . IS low cost tool , nevertheless , increase frequency use accumulate large proportion health care cost . This call evaluation study high methodological quality address limitation prior study . The scope study different exist study evaluate utility IS general medical patient . The sub-set patient focus study admit chief complaint `` shortness breath . '' The disease process former group lead shortness breath include fluid over-load congestive heart failure , underlie lung process pneumonia , COPD , and/or pulmonary embolism . There parallel mechanism hypoxia patient surgical patient patient often pain take high dos analgesic , shallow monotonous breathe immobile long periods time . From physiological standpoint sustain maximal inhalation maneuver may reverse prevent progression atelectasis maintain airway patency patient shallow breathe vary etiology surgical sub-set . In tertiary center community teach hospital effectiveness IS general medical ward evaluate use single center randomize clinical trial . The goal offer study overcome limitation prior study . Lack strong evidence base data lead inconsistency practice physician lead high health care cost . The author hope design study high methodological quality ass effectiveness IS medical patient ; thereby close knowledge gap evidence base practice may aid physician decision utilize IS .</detailed_description>
