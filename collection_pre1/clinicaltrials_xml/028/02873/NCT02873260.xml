	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Protective Efficacy Single Dose Live Attenuated Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine TV005 Protect Against Infection With rDEN3Δ30</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue infection range mild illness life-threatening disease widespread tropical subtropical region world . Infection four serotypes dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) cause dengue illness . TetraVax-DV-TV005 ( refer TV005 ) live attenuate recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine develop protect four dengue virus serotypes . This study evaluate ability single dose TV005 protect infection rDEN3Δ30 , naturally attenuate DENV-3 , give 6 month follow vaccination TV005 . This study enroll healthy adult history previous flavivirus infection . At Day 0 ( study entry ) , participant randomly assign receive either TV005 vaccine placebo . On Day 180 , participant receive rDEN3Δ30 virus . All participant record temperature 3 time day 16 day vaccination . Additional study visit occur Days 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 150 , 184 , 186 , 188 , 190 , 192 , 194 , 196 , 201 , 208 , 236 , 270 , 360 . Study visit include physical examination blood collection .</detailed_description>
