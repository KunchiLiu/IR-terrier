	<brief_summary>Heat-shock protein ( HSP ) highly conserve throughout evolution specie characterize chaperone function , thanks ability prevent aggregation promote renaturation/break damage protein . Among target , also chaperone JAK2 , key step deregulate signal myeloproliferative syndrome ( MPS ) JAK2V617F mutation . These HSP also potent cytoprotective action multiple inhibit effect apoptotic process . Little known level HSP expression , particular HSP70 HSP27 , MPS cell . However , vitro study different cell model show interest HSP90 inhibitor slow cell proliferation MPS . These result confirm animal model result term blood count overall survival . In addition , seem V617F mutate form JAK2 sensitive wild-type HSP90 inhibitor . Finally , inhibitor HSP90 remain efficacious regard inhibition cell growth , even case resistance JAK2 inhibitor . Nonetheless , HSP90 inhibitor know stimulate expression HSP , notably HSP27 HSP70 , , property , tumorigenic could lead escape phenomenon . Thus combine use several HSP inhibitor could beneficial , eventually present synergistic effect inhibition tumour process .</brief_summary>
