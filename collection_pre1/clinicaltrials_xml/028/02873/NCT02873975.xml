	<brief_title>A Study LY2606368 ( Prexasertib ) Patients With Solid Tumors With Replicative Stress Homologous Repair Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , phase II , two-arm study explore anti-tumor activity CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib ( LY2606368 ) patient advance solid tumor exhibit one following : 1 . Replicative stress , include MYC amplification , CCNE1 amplification , Rb loss , FBXW7 mutation 2 . An HR deficiency , include tumor genomic somatic mutation BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , RAD51C , RAD51D , ATR , ATM , CHK2 , Fanconi anemia pathway gene</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants must pathologically confirm advanced solid tumor standard therapy proven provide clinical benefit exist longer effective . Participants must one following ( confirm via target NextGeneration sequence [ NGS ] use DFCI/BWH OncoPanel another CLIAcertified method ) : For replicative stress cohort : MYC amplification , CCNE1 amplification , Rb loss , FBXW7 mutation , another genomic abnormality indicative replicative stress agree upon principal investigator . OR For HR deficiency cohort : genomic somatic mutation BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , RAD51C , RAD51D , ATR , ATM , CHK2 , Fanconi anemia pathway gene , another genomic somatic mutation know HR gene agree upon principal investigator . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Participants must adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/uL Platelet count ≥ 100 K/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( without transfusion support ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN , unless liver metastasis present ≤ 5 × institutional ULN acceptable Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN Participants enrol either cohort Stage 1 must disease amenable biopsy willing undergo pretreatment tumor biopsy . The potential effect LY2606368 use pregnancy lactation know . Nonclinical study LY2606368 pregnancy fetal development perform . To minimize potential risk , men woman reproductive potential use medically approve contraceptive precaution treatment 3 month follow last dose LY2606368 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 3 month completion LY2606368 administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . QTcF value ≤ 470 msec screen electrocardiogram ( EKG ) Participants chemotherapy , investigational biologic therapy , major surgery , radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior plan first dose LY2606368 therapy . Participants recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event result previous treatment prior study . Participants receive prior treatment CHK1 inhibitor . For HR deficiency cohort : participant receive prior treatment PARP inhibitor . Participants receive prior radiation therapy &gt; 25 % bone marrow . Participants know untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Participants history brain metastasis treat , longer take corticosteroid , stable image least one month follow end treatment permit . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition LY2606368 . Participants personal family history long QT syndrome . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , NYHA Class III/IV heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within 3 month enrollment , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeeding female . The potential effect LY2606368 use pregnancy breastfeed know LY2606368 potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Known HIVpositive participant ineligible participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake HIVpositive participant indicate . Participants enrol either cohort Stage 1 may anticoagulant therapy unless treat investigator deem safe temporarily hold facilitate pretreatment tumor biopsy .</criteria>
