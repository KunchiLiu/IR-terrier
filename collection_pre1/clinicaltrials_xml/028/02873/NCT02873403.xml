	<brief_summary>Around 250 million people world ( 3.8 % ) knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) . Due age increase obesity , prevalence KOA expect increase develop country next 20 year . KOA decrease quality life patient chronic pain , joint stiffness , reduce social activity , influence emotional wellness well . KOA also impact biomechanics low limb , lead amplify tibiofemoral misalignment increase medial knee joint loading . Increase medial knee joint loading may lead patient vicious circle increase knee pain , decrease activity , increase weight disease progression . Knee brace non-pharmacological treatment recommend KOA . It aim reduce misalignment limb . However , main issue poor compliance lack effectiveness , drawbacks benefit , discomfort , bad fitting , migration brace , bulkiness , aesthetic , skin irritation , blister much pressure knee . By freedom design , 3D printing may resolve complaint . This study aim compare clinical biomechanical effectiveness , comfort patient complaint knee brace make 3D printing conventional knee brace . The institute Applied Health Research Glasgow Caledonian University ( GCU ) lead experimental trial . They recruit men woman ( 40 70 year old ) suffer medial KOA Glasgow area . Participants study 10 week . During period , wear 2 different knee brace two week 1-week period without knee brace . Participants five visit GCU : leg measurement make knee brace four time fill questionnaire perform gait analysis . Besides , wear activity monitor 3 non-consecutive week .</brief_summary>
