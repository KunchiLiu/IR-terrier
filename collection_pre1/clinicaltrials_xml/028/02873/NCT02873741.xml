	<brief_summary>The purpose research study different strategy identify woman high risk anal cancer . Primarily , investigator want study risk assessment call Anal Cancer Risk Index ; give woman overall number score base risk factor may anal cancer , age , number sexual partner , smoke . Investigators seek understand whether woman higher Anal Cancer Risk Index score likely abnormal result anal pap smear , HPV test , anal biopsy . The study team collect swab cervix anus study different laboratory test could identify woman high risk cervical anal cancer . These laboratory test include anal pap smear , test marker disease test detect HPV type likely cause cancer . The study team would like see laboratory test best job predict precancerous lesion anus good indicator risk cancer . After collect swab , woman procedure call high resolution anoscopy investigator look closely anus biopsy suspicious area . Finally , study team look HPV proteins change HPV make cell see test predict anal lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators seek study different strategy identify woman high risk anal cancer . Primarily , investigator want study risk assessment call Anal Cancer Risk Index ; give woman overall number score base risk factor may anal cancer , age , number sexual partner , smoke . The study team would like determine whether woman higher Anal Cancer Risk Index score likely abnormal result anal pap smear , HPV test , anal biopsy . Next , team collect swab cervix swab anus study different laboratory test could identify woman high risk anal cancer : test include anal pap smear test detect HPV type likely cause cancer . Investigators would like see laboratory test best job predict precancerous lesion anus . After collect swab , woman procedure call high resolution anoscopy investigator look closely anus biopsy suspicious area . Finally , study team look HPV proteins change HPV make cell see test predict anal lesion . The HPV protein call E6 E7 cell change test call CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2 . Investigators measure E6/E7 CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2 cervical anal sample see woman positive marker likely abnormal result anal pap smear anal biopsy .</detailed_description>
