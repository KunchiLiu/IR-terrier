	<brief_summary>Over past decade , advancement therapy available pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) increase life expectancy qualify receive treatment . Yet , prognostication patient remain clinical dilemma . The application REVEAL registry predictive algorithm provide information estimate 1-year survival since invasive measurement right heart catheterization easily repeat , feasible continually use longitudinally assess disease burden . Simple test BNP show clinically relevant short -term long term prognostication seem correspond well right ventricular failure . Elevated right atrial pressure , estimation via IVC measurement predict poor survivorship recent retrospective analysis . As clinical measurement jugular venous pressure become less reliable , aim bring point- of-care ultrasound outpatient setting . Point care ultrasound widely use Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit setting . By measure estimate right atrial pressure ( eRAP ) via Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) measurement outpatient clinic visit aim find correlation exist widely use B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) , collect visit part regular care . These measurement follow longitudinally may aid prognostication . Data collect period 1 year clinic visit . A composite endpoint ( include death , hospitalization PH , addition new PH specific therapy stabilization period 3 month , lung transplant atrial septostomy ) separately collect . At end data collection period , clinical data collect additional 2 year via phone correspondence , chart review regular PH clinic visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension patient choose participate : Written inform consent obtain study . Patients must sign informed consent participate study related procedure . - All inclusion exclusion criterion review . - Demographic history record . - Vital sign perform . - A medication history take . - A smoking history record . - BNP level measure part usual care PH visit . - Ultrasonographic measurement perform clinic visit . - Ultrasonographic measurement : IVC Measurements - Performed subcostal view supine position . - Images capture video format . - Maximal IVC diameter 1 2 cm junction right atrium IVC end-expiration proximal junction hepatic vein . The IVC collapsibility index give estimate RAP . - Inspiratory collapse &gt; 50 % &lt; 50 % ascertain base measurement . Jugular Vein Measurements - Patient place 45° position - Longitudinal image obtain right jugular vein . - Location taper jugular vein measure , distance sternal angle record ultrasound-measured jugular venous pressure ( JVP ) . Clinical Worsening Outcomes • At visit year 1 , every 6 month year 2-3 , clinical worsen event capture . These event define : - Death - PH-related hospitalization - Lung transplant - Atrial septostomy - Functional Class worsen step therapy Study Timing - Enrollment patient period 1 year . Subsequently , patient enrol . Patients enrol follow clinically without study-related test regular clinic visit completion year 1 . - All patient enrol ultrasonographic measurement IVC jugular vein clinic visit 1 year . - Data collection regard meet clinical worsen end point BNP level collect regular clinic visit year 2 3 study . - If patient lose follow clinic ( include year-1 ) , telephone correspondence , social security database review chart review 6-month interval perform determine vital status see meet clinical worsening endpoint . - Study close final patient complete 3-years follow .</detailed_description>
