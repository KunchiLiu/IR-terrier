	<detailed_description>Project background : In Denmark 1,000 people year die fall , five time many die traffic accident . Fall accident also lead cause traumatic brain injury unnoticed problem , although type accident cause hospital bed day accident combine . Annually , almost half 375,000 elderly Danes 75 year age relatively three time many approximately 40,000 elderly people nurse home fall every year , cause 40,000 hospital contact annually . Ten percent elderly people hospitalize year fall , mostly fracture , risk increase fivefold fall . In Denmark around 1 million people 65 year age . Over next 25 year experience 50 % growth 1.5 million people 65 year age . Injury , disability death cause fall therefore widespread grow human societal problem . Many never recover completely therefore need help cope everyday life . After first fall risk increase repeat fall . Especially old people live home permanent temporary disability result severe deterioration quality life . Treatment fall also significant financial burden health social care . The main reason decline muscle weakness . Muscle weakness lead greatly increase risk fall , decrease quality life functional capacity . Musclemass -power decrease 40 percent age 20 80 year old . Recent study show even 90-year-old person double muscle strength intensive training three time per week . The level male sex hormone testosterone decrease age lead impaired muscle mass . Twenty percent men 60 50 percent 80 year , low level testosterone total equivalent 100,000 Danes . From human socio-economic perspective , important find treatment enhance function elderly .</detailed_description>
