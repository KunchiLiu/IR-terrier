No evidence locoregional disease distant metastases screen . Subjects must negative scan ( CT , CTPET MRI ) locoregional recurrence , brain lung metastasis . A negative biopsy mandate patient positive scan . Other evaluation perform clinically indicate . 5 . No history distant metastasis . 6 . Tumor tissue surgery biopsy must available determine MAGEA3 expression correlative study . 7 . Following surgery , patient must receive external beam radiotherapy ( 5866 Gy 2 Gy fraction , 5 day per week ) concomitant cisplatin start within 8 week surgery . The cumulative dose cisplatin subject receive must &gt; 150 mg/m2 . Protocol therapy must initiate within period 48 week ( 2856 day ) follow end RT . 8 .

Laboratory value obtain ≤ 14 day prior randomization : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL ( without intervention , e.g. , GCSF ) Platelets ≥ 75,000/μL ( without intervention , e.g. , transfusion ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥8.0 g/dl acceptable ) . Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ALT ≤ 2 x ULN Creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's disease , upper acceptable limit serum bilirubin 3mg/dL ) 12 . A female subject eligible enter study : pregnant nursing ; Female participant must breastfeed study period 30 day follow last dose . nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman hysterectomy , postmenopausal define 1 year without menses , ovary surgically remove current document tubal ligation ) ; childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman functional ovary document impairment oviductal uterine function would cause sterility ) . This category include woman oligomenorrhea [ even severe ] , woman perimenopausal begin menstruate . These woman must negative serum pregnancy test screening , agree one following : complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration 1st dose study agent 6 month last dose study agent ; consistent correct use 1 follow highly effective method birth control one month prior start study agent 6 month last dose : combine ( estrogen progestogen contain ) hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) progestogenonly hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , injectable , implantable ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine hormonereleasing system ( IUS ) bilateral tubal occlusion vasectomize partner ( vasectomized sole sexual partner receive medical confirmation surgical success ) 13 .

The subject must capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study capable provide valid informed consent . The subject must provide study specific informed consent prior protocol procedure part standard care , include consent assessment HLAA2 status , mandatory tissue submission MAGEA3 analysis correlative study . 15 . The subject must willing return study center vaccination studyrelated follow procedure include blood tumor collection completion image study require protocol . 1 . Known HIV hepatitis B/C infection ( test require ) . Subjects hepatitis C antibody positive may enrol confirm negative viral load screening . 2 . Subjects active autoimmune disease history autoimmune disease require systemic steroid immunosuppressive treatment . 3 . Subjects use systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressant condition within 14 day randomization . Inhaled topical steroid permit . 4 . Any medical condition would , investigator 's opinion , compromise patient 's ability mount immune response , render patient poor candidate trial could confound result study 5 .
