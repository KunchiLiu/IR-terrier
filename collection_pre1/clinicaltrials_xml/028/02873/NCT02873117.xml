	<detailed_description>Identification process retrospective prospective use medico-administrative data pathology laboratory registry Brittany drug reimbursement file patient live Brittany , France . An extraction drug reimbursement file French health reimbursement agency ( CNAM-TS ) patient live Brittany , France perform follow request : reimbursement pharmacologic treatment patent symptomatic benign hyperplasia January 1st 2010 December 31st 2011 , diagnosis prostate cancer December 31st , 2011 . This extraction do 2013 catch data far 2010 encompass health reimbursement prostate examination . A second extraction do 2014 complete data end 2013 . Secondly , identification patient use pathology laboratory registry , base code prostate examination ( prostate biopsy , prostatectomy prostate resection ) ; involvement pathology laboratory Brittany ensure completeness collection prostate examination result study period ( January 1st , 2012 December 31st , 2013 ) . A list patient record pathology laboratory level date birth , date prostate examination , type exam , result Gleason score along study number electronic file . By January 2014 , link reimbursement file ( data reimbursement within 3 year : 2009 2011 previously extract French health reimbursement agency ) do thanks three key variable ( date birth , date prostate examination , identification pathology laboratory ) data center set one global file . This design allow evaluation association 5-ARI either high grade prostate cancer low grade prostate opposite association could observe . In addition design focus target population , i.e . patient symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia , identify reimbursement drug patent symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia .</detailed_description>
