	<brief_summary>Sixteen million baby born 2010 , approximately half cesarean . Labor analgesia first choice parturients base consideration security humanization . However labor analgesia rate quite low China ( &lt; 5 % ) western country , rate 60 % . Programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) late technique labor analgesia less neurotoxicity theoretically compare Continuous Epidural Infusion ( CEI ) Patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) use commonly . In study , report less total local anesthetic consumption , few manual bolus dos great patient satisfaction PIEB technique . In China , multiple factor contribute reason low labor analgesia rate . From patient 's point view , worry unsatisfied analgesia , adapt symptom motor block , inability move legs distressing , important reason refuse labor analgesia prefer cesarean delivery . Therefore , clinical trial , plan find safe effective regimen labor analgesia Chineseparturients . This clinical trial design prove PIEB use Ropivacaine safer effective CEI labor analgesia Chinese parturients .</brief_summary>
