	<brief_title>Variability Definitions Survival Endpoints Surrogate Properties OS : Meta-analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In randomized phase III cancer clinical trial , validate objectively define evaluation criterion overall survival ( OS ) . Therapeutic progress , certain context significantly reduce overall mortality , development new type cytostatic treatment ( oppose cytotoxic treatment ) , current context strategic trial multiplication line treatment result necessity create new evaluation criterion measure treatment efficacy sooner precisely : example , progression-free survival second line treatment , duration local control , time treatment failure . These type surrogate endpoint commonly use phase II trial increasingly use replace overall survival phase III trial . Their development strongly influence necessity reduce clinical trial duration , cost number patient . However survival endpoint frequently use , often poorly define , definition vary trial . The lack standardized definition constitutes clear limitation use primary endpoint . Furthermore , variability definition important impact trial ' result affect power estimation . The ongoing DATECAN-1 project aim provide guideline definition survival endpoint cancer trial ( 2009-2011 grant Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer ) . Standardized recommendation available survival endpoint commonly use various cancer sit include pancreas , sarcomas GIST , breast , stomach . Objectives : Following guideline , one wonder sensitive definition ? Or similarly , survival endpoint ' definition impact conclusion clinical trial ? The objective DATECAN-2 study assess impact survival endpoint ' definition , define consensus guideline , trial ' result conclusion . The second objective study surrogate property OS survival endpoint . Methods : The evaluation impact variability definition survival endpoint result clinical trial evaluate use individual data datasets collect context publish ( academic ) clinical trial , well simulated datasets . After approval sponsor , data analyze use various endpoint ' definition include ( ) definition provide publication ( ii ) definition provide guideline . We identify survival endpoint , define guideline , report publication . Next , realistic data set simulate mimic data could observe randomized cancer trial . We generate data set vary proportion event ( number death , progression , etc ) depend survival endpoint interest . Ssurvival endpoint compare across treatment arm use definition provide guideline , base various scenario ( different proportion event , length follow-up , etc ) . Using data publish data set , evaluate survival endpoint term surrogate candidate OS . A hierarchy survival endpoint propose accord surrogate property base two criterion : Fleming classification R2 value validate surrogate . Depending number clinical trial , single-trial multiple-trials method employ . Single-trial methodology relies Prentice criterion Freedman 's proportion treatment effect ( PTE ) explain surrogate . In case multiple trial , meta-analysis clinical trial feasible , surrogacy candidate endpoint OS also explore use weighted linear regression , jointly estimate level association endpoint trial-level association ( R² ) treatment effect candidate surrogate final endpoint . Based result ( R² PTE ) , survival endpoint rank accord surrogate capability OS . Expected result : Analysis sensitivity clinical trial ' result survival endpoint ' definition surrogacy property key feature design conduct clinical trial . Based result , able anticipate expect impact definition effect size , sample size power . We able estimate parameter precisely provide efficient estimation . Similarly assessment surrogate property survival endpoint help u selection best surrogate marker OS , thus limit bias . Overall , produce less biased result efficient design , project important role design conduct future randomize trial .</detailed_description>
