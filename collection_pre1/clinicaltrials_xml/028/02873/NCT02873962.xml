	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate two drug call Nivolumab Bevacizumab possible treatment relapse Relapsed Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Of Nivolumab/ Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Cancers recognize immune system , circumstance , immune system may control even eliminate tumor . An antibody natural protein make immune system bind proteins molecule fight infection ill effect . Nivolumab experimental antibody drug may make immune response active Cancer . Bevacizumab antibody work stop formation blood vessel . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Nivolumab Relapsed Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer approve us . Bevacizumab FDA approve use together chemotherapy treatment Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Or Primary Peritoneal Cancer return within 6 month chemotherapy contain platinum drug . The combination Nivolumab Bevacizumab approve FDA set .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologic cytologic confirmation epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube peritoneal cancer . All histology ( include serous , mucinous , endometrioid , clear cell , MMMTs , mixed histology ) eligible . All tumor grade eligible . Participants must receive firstline platinumbased chemotherapy regimen Participants must relapse disease despite standard therapy . Participants platinumresistant platinumsensitive disease ( within 12 month ) eligible . Platinumresistant disease define relapse within 2 6 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy . Platinumsensitive disease define relapse great 6 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy . Participants platinumsensitive disease experience relapse within 6 12 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy eligible . Participants must receive 3 prior chemotherapy regimen . There limit number prior hormonal therapy . Participants must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . Participants receive prior bevacizumab eligible unless evidence unacceptable toxicity due prior bevacizumab exposure . Participants may receive prior treatment antiPD1 , anti PDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway . Participants must stop hormonal therapy least 1 week prior treatment nivolumab bevacizumab . Age ≥ 18 year Estimated life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Appendix A ) Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 14 day prior registration : WBC ≥ 2,000/µL Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/µL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine within institutional ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 60 mL/min ( calculate use CockgroftGault formula ) participant serum creatinine level institutional ULN AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 × institutional ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN ( except participant Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 × institutional ULN direct bilirubin within institutional ULN ) Coagulation parameter ( INR , aPTT ) ≤ 1.25 × institutional ULN Patients treat limited stage basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ breast cervix eligible . Patients stage IA endometrial cancer eligible follow condition meet : without vascular lymphatic invasion AND serous , clear cell grade 3 histology . Patients early stage I II cancer treat curative intent evidence recurrent cancer 3 year follow diagnosis judge investigator low risk recurrence eligible . Participants must biopsiable disease willing undergo pretreatment biopsy , archival tumor sample obtain &lt; 20 month prior study entry . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) define female experienced menarche undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Menopause define clinically 12 month amenorrhea woman 45 absence biological physiological cause . Additionally , woman age 62 surgically sterile must document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level le 40 mIU/mL document postmenopausal status . Nivolumab bevacizumab may cause fetal harm risk human pregnancy . For reason WOCBP must agree use appropriate method ( ) contraception 6 month last dose study treatment , per FDA recommendation use contraception follow bevacizumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start study treatment . Women must breastfeed Participants permit use topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhalational corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) . Physiologic replacement dos systemic corticosteroid permit , even &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent , absence active autoimmune disease . A brief course corticosteroid prophylaxis ( e.g. , contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( e.g. , delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients platinumrefractory disease ineligible . Platinumrefractory disease define relapse le 2 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy . Patients platinumsensitive disease relapse great 12 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy ineligible . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Participants may receive investigational agent participate investigational trial within past 4 week . Participants must agree use natural herbal product `` folk remedy '' participate study . Patients history allergic reaction attribute bevacizumab compound similar chemical biologic composition nivolumab bevacizumab exclude . Patients exclude active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression least 6 month treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose nivolumab bevacizumab administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Patients follow cardiovascular disease exclude : History myocardial infarction within six month Unstable angina Angina pectoris require use antianginal medication History document congestive heart failure ( NYHA classification III IV ) document cardiomyopathy Valvular disease document compromise cardiac function If cardiac function assessment clinically indicate perform : LVEF le normal per institutional guideline , &lt; 55 % , threshold normal otherwise specify institutional guideline Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy Patients may evidence preexist inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic BP &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg ) , must normal blood pressure ( ≤140/90 mmHg ) take clinic set medical professional within 2 week prior start study . Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Vascular disease include aortic aneurysm dissection History stroke , transient ischemic attack subarachnoid hemorrhage Ventricular arrhythmia except benign premature ventricular contraction Cardiac conduction abnormality require pacemaker Known history QT/QTc prolongation torsades de pointes QTc prolongation &gt; 470 msec significant ECG abnormality note screen Grade 2 high proteinuria ( 2+ high protein urinalysis urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio ≥ 1.0 ; test perform , UPC use evaluate eligibility ) hematuria . Participants may evidence bowel obstruction , abdominal fistula , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month study entry . Participants current sign symptom suggestive bowel obstruction include early partial obstruction ineligible . Participants history gastrointestinal perforation time point ineligible . Nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture . Serious active infection require intravenous antibiotic and/or hospitalization study entry . Current dependency IV hydration TPN .
