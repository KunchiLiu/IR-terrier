FBT 's concurrent care two generation obesity family efficacious cost-effective family member treat separate health care provider . Despite recognize efficacy , FBT mainly available specialty clinic many child fail receive guideline-based level treatment , recommend U.S. Preventive Services Task Force . Primary care offer optimal set delivery FBT capitalize establish relationship primary care provider family .

One challenge integrate childhood obesity treatment primary care optimize limited health care resource . In behavioral weight loss program , individual learn diet , physical activity , behavior change information quickly , others learn slowly . Individuals also differ ability implement treatment recommendation due individual difference , problem delay gratification . FBT accommodate individual difference use personalized system instruction , mastery model , content dose treatment calibrate need family , ensure treatment effort consistent need . This multi-site , clinical trial aim evaluate two year period effectiveness FBT deliver trained interventionist co-located within primary care plus enhance usual care deliver primary care provider ( FBT+EUC ) compare enhance usual care alone ( EUC ) . Participants representative sample 528 family 6-12 year-old child parent overweight/obese . Weight change approximately 228 sibling overweight/obese 2-18 year age also study . This study test group difference child ( Primary Specific Aim 1A ) parent ( Primary Specific Aim 1B ) weight change , well weight change sibling overweight/obese ( Secondary Aim 1 ) , change parent child delay gratification , change delay gratification relate parent child weight change ( Secondary Aim 2 ) , participant level predictor treatment success ( Secondary Aim 3 ) , provider attitude toward evidence-based treatment perception FBT may relate intention use colocated FBT practice future ( Exploratory Aim 1 ) . Establishing FBT effectively implement within real world setting crucial create system child family suffer obesity treat centralized primary care setting .</detailed_description>
