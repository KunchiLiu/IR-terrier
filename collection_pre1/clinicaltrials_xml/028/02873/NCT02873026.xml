	<brief_summary>Eye trauma lead cause blindness visual impairment . Penetrating injury eye likely result poor vision main cause scar response retina ( proliferative vitreoretinopathy , PVR ) The purpose study investigate potential anti-inflammatory treatment ( triamcinolone acetonide ) improve outcome surgery eye suffer severe trauma.There good evidence laboratory study additional steroid treatment around eye time surgery could reduce scar reduce inflammation improve visual outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Steroid Combination Ocular Trauma ( ASCOT ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma important cause visual impairment blindness worldwide lead cause blindness young adult males.Globally estimate 1.6 million people blind result ocular trauma 2.3 million suffer bilateral low vision . Ocular trauma commonest cause unilateral blindness world today 19 million unilateral blindness low vision . It estimate almost one million people United States live trauma-related visual impairment . Ocular trauma extensive socio-economic cost - patient open globe injury lose mean 70 day work . In United States work relate eye injury cost $ 300 million per year ( www.prevent blindness.org ) equate annual cost UK economy ( comparable data exists ) Â£37.5 million . In UK estimate 5000 patient per year sustain eye injuries serious enough require hospital admission 250 permanently blind injured eye . Recent European study document incidence 2.4 3.2 per 100000 per year open-globe injury suggest annual incidence UK 1500 2000 . Ocular injury result visual loss invariably affect posterior segment eye prevention visual loss involve posterior segment ( vitreoretinal ) surgery . It clear recent publish data although vitreoretinal surgical technique improve , outcomes remain unsatisfactory development intraocular scar response proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( PVR ) lead cause .</detailed_description>
