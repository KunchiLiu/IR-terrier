	<detailed_description>Patients schedule lung resection prospectively recruit . Demographic , clinical data pulmonary function test result record . Emphysema visually score histological remodelling feature note . Primary bronchial epithelial cell ( BEC ) extract culture wound closure assay . The investigator determine mean speed wound closure ( MSWC ) cell proliferation index , matrix metalloprotease ( MMP ) -2 , MMP-9 cytokine level supernatant BEC 18 hour cell wound . In subset patient , bronchiolar epithelial cell also culture wound closure assay MSWC analyze .</detailed_description>
