	<detailed_description>Introduction : Laparoscopic procedure produce adverse effect splanchnic organ . Pneumoperitoneum non-physiologic condition cause high intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) associate significant direct indirect effect renal physiology . Aim study : To establish AKI incidence patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy . To identify potential risk factor associate development AKI . To establish relationship IAP procedure AKI incidence . Study Design : Study population : A single center prospective cohort study conduct . 100 patient undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy Galilee Medical Center include . Inclusion criterion : age &gt; 18 year , able sign consent form , stable kidney function . Exclusion criterion : end stage renal disease , acute kidney injury need dialysis three month prior procedure , acute infection , acute inflammation , BMI &gt; 40 , malignancy pregnancy . The diagnosis AKI make base Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) Clinical Practice Guideline 2012 , compare baseline post-operative serum creatinine cystatin C monitoring urine output procedure procedure 24 hour . Data Analysis : Results present mean Â± standard deviation quantitative data . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
