	<brief_summary>Approximately 10 US Study Sites participate total 18 month Study population consist adult age 22 , report overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms least 3 month . Primary Study Objective 1 . To assess efficacy StimRouter stimulation therapy improve OAB symptom urgency frequency measure Patient Voiding Diary target posterior tibial nerve 2 . To assess safety StimRouter therapy Secondary Study Objective To evaluate : Efficacy StimRouter stimulation therapy decrease specific OAB symptom urgency , frequency , urinary urge incontinence measure Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) 7-day Patient Voiding Diary Study Design prospective , multi-center , randomize , double-blinded Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint difference investigational control group proportion responder , define return normal voiding ( 7-day average voids/leak episodes &lt; 8 ) OR &gt; 50 % improvement average void frequency 8 patient baseline OR &gt; 50 % improvement average number moderate severe urgency episode approximately three month program measure 7-day Patient Voiding Diary . Primary Outcomes : 1 . Proportion responder base Patient Voiding Diary 2 . Adverse Event Reports Secondary Endpoints : The secondary efficacy endpoint difference specific OAB symptom urgency , frequency , urinary urge incontinence measure base ( 1 ) difference proportion subject investigational control group moderately markedly improve overall response 7 level Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) approximately three month program ; ( 2 ) difference responses 7-day Patient Voiding Diary baseline visit approximately three month program . Secondary Outcomes : 1 . Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) 2 . Urgency , frequency , urinary urge incontinence measure Daily Patient Voiding Diary</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Overactive Bladder Treatment Using StimRouter Neuromodulation System : A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 120 subject enrol Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation ( PTNS ) Overactive Bladder study . After sign informed consent complete screen visit , eligible candidate ask ( 1 ) stop OAB medication ( include limit anti-muscarinic medication tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) well stabilize dosage frequency concomitant medication 3 week , applicable , ( 2 ) complete daily Patient Voiding Diary 7 day . Subjects return office baseline review . If screening baseline criterion meet , subject enrol , randomize 1:1 ratio either `` control group '' `` investigational group '' schedule implant StimRouter device . After approximately 3 week heal post-implant , study participant program accord randomization assignment . All subject instruct apply stimulation least 3 days/week least 30 minutes/day ( i.e. , minimum protocol requirement device use ) 6 month apply stimulation anticipate OAB event . Patient Voiding Diaries complete participant 7 day prior follow-up visit provide office follow-up visit . Follow-up visit occur Month 1 , Month 2 , Month 3 , Month 5 Month 6 . Each follow-up visit include review subject void diary completion subject questionnaire measure OAB quality life assessment . Final follow-up evaluation subject occur Month6 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female age ≥22 year competent provide consent 2 . Minimum 3 month selfreported OAB symptom 3 . A mean score &gt; 4.0 OABq symptom question 18 4 . Diagnosis OAB Overactive Bladder Symptom Score ( OABSS ) &gt; 8.0 5 . Average urinary frequency ≥ 10 daily void associate urgency 6 . Able tolerate sense tibial nerve stimulation 7 . Willing discontinue OAB and/or tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) medication 3 week prior implant entire study period change dosages/frequency others 3 week prior implant 8 . Selfreported failed/inadequate response first secondline therapy OAB 9 . Body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 30 investigator expect BMI interfere ability place implant negatively impact heal implant site 10 . Able toilet self maintain good personal hygiene 11 . Able utilize StimRouter system independently 12 . Negative urine dipstick result ( UTI detect ) 13 . If female childbearing age , willing use medicallyacceptable method contraception duration study ( e.g . oral contraceptive , condom , shot , patch , etc . ) 14 . Able provide clear , thoughtful response question questionnaires 15 . Willing visit office device program clinical evaluation 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 6 month start external device usage 16 . Willing complete Patient Voiding Diary 7 consecutive day prior implant 7 consecutive day followup visit 1 . Neurogenic bladder 2 . Urinary tract mechanical obstruction include limited Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) 3 . Treatment bladder pelvic floor dysfunction botulinum toxin ( Botox ® ) surgery past 12 month 4 . Urinary tract , bladder vaginal infection inflammation 5 . More minimal level stress incontinence mixed incontinence stress component likely confound study outcome 6 . Diabetes 7 . Allergy local anesthetic adhesive 8 . Bleeding disorder anticoagulant stop 3 day implant 9 . Pregnant , lactating , plan become pregnant , give birth past 12 month , female childbearing potential practicing medicallyapproved method birth control 10 . Skin lesion compromise skin implant stimulation site 11 . Use investigational drug device therapy participation study involve impact gynecologic , urinary renal function within past 4 week 12 . Implanted neurostimulator , pacemaker , defibrillator 13 . Current use TENS pelvic region , back leg 14 . Current prior use electrical stimulation therapy OAB ( e.g . PTNS , sacral nerve stimulation , pelvic floor muscle stimulation biofeedback ) 15 . Metallic implant knee 16 . Prior vaginal mesh similar surgery , intravaginal pessary , evidence stress incontinence significant enough confound study 17 . Requirement serial MRIs 18 . Presence document condition abnormality could compromise safety patient 19 . Life expectancy less 1 year</criteria>
