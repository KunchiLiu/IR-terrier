	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy 18F-Fluoromethylcholine ( 18F-FCH ) PET/CT Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death North American men older 50 year . Positron emission tomography / computer tomography ( PET/CT ) nuclear medicine procedure base measurement positron emission radiolabeled tracer molecule . A common radiotracer use today 18F-fluoromethylcholine ( aka fluorocholine FCH ) radiolabeled choline derivative . Imaging FCH-PET/CT use characterize localize prostate cancer vivo . There extensive data literature show value FCH-PET/CT image accurately stag restaging prostate cancer . FCH-PET/CT standard care many European country . Study Objectives The objective study confirm safety efficacy FCH-PET/CT establish ability reproduce result literature use FCH-PET/CT diagnostic decision make tool management two predefined group prostate cancer patient , specifically , biochemical recurrence high risk staging . The primary endpoint study incidence adverse event ( AE ) study population 24 hour follow scan , sensitivity specificity FCH-PET/CT v CT per-patient per-lesion basis . Study Design This multi-center open label study one ( 1 ) FCH-PET/CT perform study participant . A PET/CT scan take 2-3 hour . Safety FCH-PET/CT exhibit favorable dosimetry , deliver organ dos comparable low deliver 18F-FDG . The safety FCH dispute expect number adverse event study zero . Sample Size Recruitment Target enrollment 1500 patient . This sufficient detect AE prevalence 0.3 % 99 % confidence . For efficacy endpoint , approximately 500 subject would provide 90 % power alpha=0.05 one-sided level significance specificity sensitivity superior specificity sensitivity null hypothesis . Patients recruit urologists clinical setting . Initial contact consent department urology .</detailed_description>
