	<brief_summary>The management cancer therapeutic guidance shortly mostly base histopathological consideration tumor . development target therapy turn point keep increase . These molecule target specific molecular defect tumor make effective specific treatment . But treatment effective tumor specific molecular abnormality characterize know . These therapeutic progress make possible decode human genome molecular defect occur carcinogenesis process . Now , dozen therapy target specific molecular abnormality available therapeutic arsenal dozen development clinical trial Phase 1 3 . In recent year , democratization next generation sequence open new era cancer research also molecular diagnostics . Indeed , enormous sequence capability offer high-throughput sequencing technology allow analysis limited time entire coding sequence genome ( exome ) , even entire genome tumor ( whole genome sequencing ) . Thus , evolution development broadband associate bioinformatics tool genomics technique make possible establish genetic profile tumor . Targeted diagnosis molecular abnormality allow propose specifically target direct therapeutic identify genetic alteration supposedly responsible tumor development . An analysis tumor exome next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) provide information genetic modification tumor . This study aim evaluate therapeutic strategy treatment . The objective study evaluate clinical benefit analysis exome perform current practice Centre Georges-Fran√ßois Leclerc Dijon . The analysis perform quantifying number patient undergoing therapeutic proposal base result analysis profile tumor .</brief_summary>
