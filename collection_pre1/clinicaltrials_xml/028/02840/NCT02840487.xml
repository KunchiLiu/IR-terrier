	<brief_summary>Background : The Zika virus pass human infected mosquito . It usually cause fever , rash , joint pain , red eye . Recently , case microcephaly ( abnormally small head ) report baby bear mother infect Zika virus . Rare case severe nerve weakness call Guillain-Barr ( SqrRoot ) ( Copyright ) syndrome report people Zika virus infection . There currently cure vaccine infection . VRC-ZKADNA085-00-VP new vaccine instruct body make small amount Zika virus protein . The body may use build immune response . Objective : To see VRC-ZKADNA085-00-VP safe cause side effect . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 35 Design : Participants screen separate protocol : - Medical history - Physical exam - Lab urine test Participants randomly assign 1 4 study group . They 18 clinic visit 2 year . Most occur first year , long-term follow-up visit month 18 24 . Visits include physical exam blood urine test . Participants vaccine injection . A high-pressure device push vaccine skin muscle upper arm . They 2-3 injection depend group . Vaccine visit last 4-6 hour . Others last 1-2 hour . Participants keep diary 7 day injection . They record temperature measure skin change injection site day . Participants might extra visit blood test health change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I/Ib , randomize , multicenter clinical study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity four vaccination regimen Zika virus ( ZIKV ) disease . Vaccination regimens VRC-ZKADNA085-00-VP ( ZIKV DNA ) vaccine administer Day 0 Week 8 ( Group 1 ) ; Day 0 Week 12 ( Group 2 ) ; Day 0 , Weeks 4 8 ( Group 3 ) ; Day 0 , Weeks 4 20 ( Group 4 ) test . The primary hypothesis ZIKV DNA vaccine safe well tolerate healthy adult . A secondary hypothesis vaccine regimens elicit ZIKV-specific immune response . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine regimens healthy adult . Secondary objective relate immunogenicity vaccination regimen . Product Description : The investigational VRC-ZKADNA085-00-VP vaccine develop Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) , NIAID , compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid encode wild type precursor transmembrane M ( prM ) envelope ( E ) proteins H/PF/2013 strain ZIKV . Vaccine supply single dose vial concentration 4 mg/mL . ZIKV DNA vaccine dose 4 mg administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection deltoid muscle . Subjects : Healthy adult 18 35 year age . Study Plan : Subjects enrol 3 study site , randomize equally 4 study group , receive 2-3 vaccination . The protocol require 18 schedule clinic visit telephone follow-up contact study injection . Solicited reactogenicity evaluate use 7-day diary card . Assessment vaccine safety include clinical observation monitor hematological chemical parameter clinical visit 44 week study . -VRC 319 Study Schema - Group:1 ; Subjects* : 20 ; Day 0 ; Week 8 ; - Group:2 ; Subjects* : 20 ; Day 0 ; Week 12 ; - Group:3 ; Subjects* : 20 ; Day 0 ; Week 4 ; Week 8 ; - Group:4 ; Subjects* : 20 ; Day 0 ; Week 4 ; Week 20 ; - TOTAL ; Subjects* : 80 - Up 120 total enrollment permit additional subject need assessment safety immune response . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate safety immune response throughout study 44 week follow first vaccine administration durability immune response two additional long term follow-up visit 18 24 month .</detailed_description>
