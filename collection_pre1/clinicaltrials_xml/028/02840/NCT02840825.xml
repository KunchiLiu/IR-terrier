	<brief_summary>Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) lead cause neonatal viral infection significant impact neurosensory development newborn especially preterm infant . HCMV infection may result maternal-fetal transmission pregnancy postnatal transmission . While congenital HCMV infection affect 2-5 % preterm infant , risk postnatal infection , particularly breast milk , much high population ( prevalence 20 % ) . Many learned society wonder interest inactivate HCMV ( freeze pasteurization ) breast milk order reduce eliminate contamination child . However , freeze relatively inefficient reduce contamination pasteurization drastically alter nutritional quality milk . Therefore , systematic preventive treatment breast milk preterm infant currently recommend . An alternative approach could consist detect HCMV breast milk target at-risk situation . This detection perform PCR cost time require obtain result prohibits use mass detection . Currently , viral status breast milk explore practice , depend health center , breastfeed continue milk systematically inactivated.The main objective VIRUMILK study feasibility CMV detection breast milk lactate mother biochip.The ultimate goal prevent postnatal HCMV infection preterm newborns less 33 week .</brief_summary>
