	<brief_title>The Impact Alcohol Consumption Tuberculosis Treatment Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major knowledge gap degree poor treatment outcome alcohol-abusing patient due noncompliance alone . Problem alcohol use impact retention care adherence daily TB treatment . Poor medication adherence increase default TB care document patient consume alcohol regularly several country . Yet research identify reason ( beyond adherence ) poor outcome among patient problem alcohol use . A key barrier understand persistent biologic effect alcohol TB disease inadequate data adherence , include detail data daily adherence ( number miss dos medication ) . Research combine well approach alcohol ascertainment adherence monitoring need advance understand pathway alcohol use TB disease interact . Aim 1 : To ( ) examine association problem alcohol use TB treatment outcome , ( ii ) demonstrate association persist independent adherence TB treatment . Aim 2 : To evaluate effect problem alcohol use PK/PD TB drug . Culture-positive , pulmonary TB patient recruit Worcester , South Africa , follow 18-month period . Patients complete interviewer-administered questionnaire alcohol use health-related behavior , recent alcohol use confirm use biomarker ( phosphatidylethanol ) . Chest radiograph , sputum smear culture , blood sample collect compare biology treatment response patient without problem alcohol use . During 6-month treatment period , smart mobile-phone technology use document daily drug adherence train community worker . Serial measure alcohol intake serial sputum isolates collect assess treatment response TB drug side effect record . In addition , intensive PK/PD study isoniazid , rifampin , ethambutol , pyrazinamide perform 200 HIV-seronegative patient .
