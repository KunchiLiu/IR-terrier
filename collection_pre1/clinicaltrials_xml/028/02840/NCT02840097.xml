	<brief_summary>Trauma lead cause death disability child United States . The long-term goal project evaluate benefit harm tranexamic acid ( TXA ; drug stop bleed ) severely injured child . This 40-patient pilot study evaluate feasibility two subsequent large-scale study TXA injure child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Traumatic Injury Clinical Trial Evaluating Tranexamic Acid Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , drug stop bleed , drug treatment improve survival adult serious bleed injury . However , TXA use routinely child traumatic bleeding study appropriately evaluate TXA injured child . Such study potential significant impact improve life injured child family , find successful . The long-term objective evaluate benefit risk TXA severely injure child . This achieve ultimately conduct two large-scale , multicenter , randomize control trial TXA use severely injured child . One trial evaluate TXA child severe injury body ( `` torso injury '' , i.e. , abdomen chest ) second trial evaluate TXA child moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ( TBIs ) . However , conduct clinical trial critically ill child challenge due low disease frequency complex parent consent/child assent procedure . The investigator conduct pilot study , design similarly full-scale trial much small patient enrollment , assess feasibility , fill crucial information gap two subsequent large-scale clinical trial . Injured child randomize one three study arm : two different TXA dose placebo . The specific aim propose pilot study demonstrate ability efficiently identify enroll child hemorrhagic torso injury TBIs multicenter , randomize control pilot study evaluate two dos TXA placebo . The pilot study enroll 40 child meet inclusion exclusion criterion 4 participate site . To demonstrate ability collect outcome measure , investigator collect identical anticipated outcome measure subsequent clinical trial : total blood product transfuse initial 48 hour care ( torso injury trial ) , intracranial hemorrhage progression first 24 hour neurocognitive function 6 month randomization ( TBI trial ) . The investigator also collect safety outcome , specifically venothromboembolic event ( i.e. , blot clot blood vessel ) seizure within initial 24 hour study drug . Additional objectives pilot study : evaluate ability efficiently screen , identify , consent , randomize , initiate study intervention within 3 hour injury , ass protocol adherence variability care enrol patient , identify operational efficiency potential enhance success subsequent trial .</detailed_description>
