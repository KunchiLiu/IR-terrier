	<detailed_description>Within three-year research programme investigator use RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method ( Fitch , 2001 ) achieve national consensus component Compassion ( 'the Intervention ' ) , complex intervention model end life care people advance dementia . The Intervention consist two core component : facilitation integrate , multi-disciplinary approach assessment , treatment care ; education , train support formal informal carers . The development describe detail manual publication ( Jones , 2015 ) . The Intervention coordinate Advanced Dementia Interdisciplinary Care Leader ( ICL ) The ICL role require extensive clinical experience care frail old people dementia , particularly towards end life . Skills may draw field nurse , social work profession ally medicine . This theory-driven approach improve end life care advance dementia previously test real-world setting . The protocol publish ( Elliott , 2014 ) . The study exploratory , naturalistic implementation study Compassion Intervention follow principle dynamic sustainability , recognise implement protocol real-life setting require adaptation , rigid adherence guideline test controlled setting may suitable effective broad context ( Chambers , 2013 ) . The investigator structure approach use phase implementation describe Grol colleague ( 2007 ) include orientation , insight , acceptance , change maintenance . A full time ICL social care background considerable experience work people dementia care home employ . The ICL supervise clinician palliative dementia expertise within research team two external clinician . Two care home , predominately nursing home level care , invite participate involve earlier phase research programme ; longitudinal ( 9 month ) cohort study examine need people advance dementia family carers ( Jones , 2012 ) . Care home manager give write consent site participate , permission ICL carry clinical assessment eligible resident access file . Managers identify eligible resident . Implementation occur 15 month . In month 1 , care home , ICL meet care home manager , deputy manager key external healthcare professional visit care home . Posters promote intervention display care home . The Intervention launch Care Home 1 May 2014 Care Home 2 June 2014 . The ICL actively engage care home six month co-ordinate activity . After six month ICL cease active engagement . To assess maintenance activity , interview relevant stakeholder conduct ICL withdraws month 7 , 11 15 . The ICL keep reflective diary document observation practice , liaison staff , family resident , examples improvement care personal response role . The diary influence implementation enable ICL reflect role situ modify approach require . The ICL keep daily log time spend task related implementation enable estimation cost . It expect care home external healthcare professional time involve Intervention meeting train consistent usual job description consider additional cost Intervention opportunity cost offset train skill acquire . During six month care home , ICL collect monthly care home-wide data number resident : document resuscitation status ; pain management plan ; preferred place death record ; hospital admission . Data emergency phone call location death collect . Resident assessment undertaken ICL use research data . These data maintain within care home clinical information accord governance police . Findings assessment , however , reflect anonymised ICL diary use inform Intervention activity train . Formal training session evaluate use evaluation form . Monthly individual resident outcome data collect researcher ( ICL ) resident assess ICL family carers . As resident unlikely capacity make inform decision participate research , care home manager invite next kin/primary contact give consent monthly outcome data collect . If next kin available , professional consultee provide agreement accord UK 's Mental Capacity Act ( 2005 ) . Residents recruit first four month implementation ensure collection least three month outcome data . Process data report total number activity undertaken total ICL hour spend different activity . ICL hour spend activity associate implementation cost use UK Department Health Health Education England tariff estimate cost engaging ICL . Training evaluation outcomes ( facility wide individual ) analyse use descriptive statistic use statistical package IBM SPSS Version 22 ( 2013 ) . Outcome data use monitor potential harm examine feasibility collect measure future trial , hence sample size calculation perform . Using descriptive statistic compare individual outcome data earlier cohort study sample size small statistical analysis . Semi-structured interview conduct purposive sample care home staff external healthcare professional ICL complete six month site also assess sustainability ICL leave . Interviews conduct month 7 , 11 15 . Family carers agree resident monthly individual data collection invite take part interview month 7 . Participants provide write informed consent prior interview . Interviews audio-recorded transcribed verbatim . The interview aim : assess participant ' view strength weakness Intervention ; identify whether change practice improve care resident advance dementia family carers implement due Intervention ; explore whether change maintain ICL leave . Transcripts check audio-recording . One researcher involve interview transcribe code transcript use QSR International Pty Ltd NVivo V10 software ( 2012 ) . Framework analysis use ( Gale , 2013 ) , base Grol 's ( 2007 ) phase implementation . Small chunk text extract coded , summarise content . Coded text grouped large theme within five phase . Themes review checked second researcher .</detailed_description>
