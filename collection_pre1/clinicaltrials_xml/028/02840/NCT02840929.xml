	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : Up 15 % patient peptic ulcer bleed develop rebleeding , mainly ulcers higher-risk stigma ( i.e . Forrest class Ia IIb ) . Randomized trial show second-look endoscopy effective reduce rebleeding rate . However , whether withhold aspirin anti-platelet agent ( treatment establish cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease ) remain controversial . Studies show although continuation anti-platelet agent reduce mortality rate due reduce cardiovascular cerebrovascular event , marginal increase rebleeding risk . HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize continuation aspirin anti-platelet agent couple second-look endoscopy could reduce rebleeding rate without increase risk thromboembolic event high-risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Second-look Endoscopy Peptic Ulcer Rebleeding Patients With Early Resumption Antiplatelet Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient find high-risk peptic ulcer endoscopy , treat endoscopic combination therapy include adrenaline injection follow either thermal coagulation haemoclips achieve haemostasis . Peptic ulcer high-risk stigmata ulcer active bleeding , non-bleeding visible blood vessel , adherent blood clot accord Forrest classification ( Ia IIb ) . After initial haemostasis high-risk ulcer , patient continue require anti-platelet agent ( namely , aspirin , clopidogrel , prasugrel , ticagrelor ) treatment prophylaxis cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease eligible inclusion study . Eligible patient randomly allocate schedule second-look endoscopy 16-24 hour initial endoscopy ( i.e . intervention group ) , receive conventional standard care ( i.e . control group ) . Randomization perform 1:1 ratio computer generate random sequence . For patient allocate second-look endoscopy group , endoscopic retreatment perform ulcer show persistence high-risk stigma . Retreatment perform combination adrenaline injection follow thermal coagulation haemoclips . Standard conventional care offer group patient , endoscopy indicated case suspect clinical bleeding define subsequent section . Both intervention control group receive bolus injection proton-pump inhibitor ( esomeprazole 80mg ) , follow high dose infusion 8mg/h continuously 72 hour initial endoscopy . Thereafter , group receive oral form proton-pump inhibitor ( esomeprazole 40mg/d ) Rebleeding suspect clinically presence fresh haematemesis , haematochezia/melaena normal stool , unstable haemodynamics systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg pulse ≥ 100 beats/min ( rule cause shock , e.g . cardiogenic septic shock ) , drop haemoglobin level 2 g/dL within 24 hour despite transfusion 2 unit blood period . If one feature present , perform emergency endoscopy confirm diagnosis recurrent peptic ulcer bleed either persistence ulcer high-risk stigma ( Forrest I IIb ) fresh blood stomach ) . Rebleeding define confirm presence clinical endoscopic feature . The finding endoscopic high-risk stigma second-look endoscopy alone without clinical feature would label rebleeding . During hospitalization , patient close monitoring vital sign include blood pressure , pulse oxygen saturation . Blood test take daily haemoglobin renal function include urea creatinine first 3 day . A designated team gastroenterologist assess patient twice daily clinical feature rebleeding , abdominal complication development thromboembolic complication . Cardiac enzymes ( creatine kinase troponin T ) , electrocardiogram compute tomography scan brain order clinical suspicion cardiovascular cerebrovascular complication . After observation 72 hour medical unit , patient successful endoscopic haemostasis without clinical evidence rebleeding either discharge transferred convalescent hospital rehabilitation . All patient give esomeprazole 40mg/d discharge prior anti-platelet therapy resume . Patient contact research staff day 7 telephone symptom discomfort . Patients also contact u via telephone hotlines suspect rebleeding urgent inquires . They follow-up specialized outpatient clinic 30 day primary endoscopy . Blood test repeat day 30 drug compliance anti-platelet therapy esomeprazole check pill count . If patient default follow-up , contact via phone call . In addition , identify post-discharge hospitalization within first 30 day via electronic medical record Hospital Authority .</detailed_description>
