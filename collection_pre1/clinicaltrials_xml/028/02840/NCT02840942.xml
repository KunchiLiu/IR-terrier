	<brief_summary>Peripheral intravenous catheter ( IVs ) utilize majority hospitalize child . The placement IVs require significant staff time , contribute health care cost , cause pain distress patient receive . Techniques currently use Children 's Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) reduce child 's anxiety increase success IV placement center depend member Child Life Department distract patient insertion . Recent literature suggest humanoid robot powerful form distraction lead decrease pain painful procedure child . Work do University Southern California ( USC ) Interaction Lab show socially assistive robot use technique complex pure distraction lead human-robot interaction perceive positive human . The investigator propose project pair child receive IV either ( 1 ) Child Life staff member ( 2 ) pure distraction robot + Child Life ( 3 ) robot teach cop skill + Child Life goal reduce pain . Pain measure participant self-report , family member perceive pain , parasympathetic activation , pain behavior measure video .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robots Reduce Pain During IV Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At USC University Park , computer science collaborator program robot speak script use interaction participant ( see additional support document ) . At CHLA , patient arrive radiology suite IV placement prior MRI utilize Child Life Services approach consented inclusion . No participant receive IV purely purpose study ; participant already order receive IV medical team include . After consent participant randomize block use random-condition generate document one three test condition : ( 1 ) control , usual distraction service provide one hospital 's child life specialist ( 2 ) usual child life + non-coping robot ( 2 ) usual child life + cop robot . Prior procedure participant 's parent ( legal guardian ) complete short survey relate pain previous IV insertion , anxiety related procedure , attitude toward robot . Participant 's parent/guardian also complete validated measure child temperament . Participants complete baseline measure temperament . Participants rate current level pain use Wong-Baker FACES scale . Participant 's anxiety level assess use Children 's Fear Scale . Participant 's baseline heart rate blood pressure record . The IV placement video record condition . Independent assessor aware research aim review tape score measure strength robot-child interaction pain behavior . One research team member record number attempt need place IV . A trained research team member responsible operate robot randomize condition . The robot use MAKI - open-source 3D printable robot design Hello Robo Inc . The company provide funding project . During interaction robot speak child-like , gender neutral voice . It ask short question participant pre-recorded response option ( see MAKI script support document ) . Participants interact either child life robot touch tablet . This minimum risk study , similar risk involve watch video screen . The robot small move facial feature , participant touch . Pre- post-intervention participant repeat FACES Fear Scales . The participant parent/guardian give short post-survey regard thought utility interaction amount participant 's pain . Heart rate monitor continuously throughout interaction . Videos evaluate use modify Yale Preoperative Anxiety Index The Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Short Form ( CAMPIS-SF ) .</detailed_description>
