	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate feasibility indocyanine green ( ICG ) -based fluorescence image detection prostate tumor metastatic lymph node . By correlate ICG fluorescence pattern pathologically confirm tumor nodal status , would possible use fluorescence navigation system help prostate biopsy lymph node dissection future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ICG-based Fluorescence Imaging Localization Prostate Cancer Metastatic Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct vivo vitro pilot study order evaluate diagnostic performance fluorescence detection prostate cancer metastatic lymph node . All patient include study receive radical prostatectomy intravenous injection 0.4 mg/Kg ICG . ICG administer immediately patient anesthetize . The fluorescence analysis perform intraoperatively laparoscopic image surgery hand-held imaging . The prostate lymph node specimen without fluorescence signal sent Department Pathology pathological analysis . The histopathological procedure perform without knowledge fluorescence analysis .</detailed_description>
