	<brief_title>Pilot Study Intra-abdominal Photodynamic Diagnosis Peritoneal Carcinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypericin-PDT study examination patient gastric cancer . The peritoneal carcinosis ( PC ) adult represent final stage advance tumor treat past , usually mean palliative chemotherapy . An improvement survival patient PC could improve use maximum cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) achieve radical removal entire tumor mass combination CRS intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) event-free survival overall survival . A cure patient achieve rare case . An essential problem treatment peritoneal carcinomatosis poorly differentiate surround tissue due location , tumor often well recognize size . This result differ ( scar tissue ) surgeon difficulty eigentlichem tumor tissue surround tissue . Through use innovative diagnostic therapeutic option ( example , photodynamic diagnosis ( PDD ) therapy ( PDT ) ) mention problem improve . In photodynamic diagnosis contrast tumor surround healthy tissue improve interaction photodynamic active substance light particular wavelength . The PDT base topical systemic administration photosensitizer ( hypericin ) , irradiated light suitable wavelength presence oxygen oxygen radical ( consequence direct cytotoxicity tumor cell lead ) form . The study carry Department General , Visceral Transplantation Surgery Tübingen 50 adult patient . The study propose would examine hypericin-supported Fluoreszenzlaparoskopy term tumor size , number location combination photodynamic diagnosis ( PDD ) therapy ( PDT ) regard detection peritoneal metastases locally advanced gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
