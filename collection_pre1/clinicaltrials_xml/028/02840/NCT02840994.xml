	<brief_summary>The objective propose clinical study investigate safety tolerability CV301 combination OPDIVO® ( nivolumab ) , anti PD1- inhibitor , compare nivolumab alone subject previously treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The clinical study design evaluate possible enhanced antitumor activity CV301 nivolumab compare nivolumab alone set nivolumab standard-of-care , second-line therapy , metastatic NSCLC . The rationale combining CV301 nivolumab base hypothesis CV301 induce specific immune response tumor , combination , nivolumab may augment T cell-mediated immune response generate CV301 block inhibitory signal PD-1 . The study include Phase 1 dose escalation part ass safety tolerability CV301 alone , prior move combination nivolumab ( Phase 1b component ) . The Phase 1 part trial follow Phase 1b component test single arm lead-in stage safety tolerability combination treatment , i.e . CV301 plus nivolumab , expand number patient treat randomized Phase 2 part trial . The objective Phase 2 ass safety preliminary efficacy CV301 combination nivolumab compare nivolumab alone subject previously treat NSCLC .</brief_summary>
