	<detailed_description>Prevalence anemia India among high world . A high proportion woman industrialize develop country become anemic pregnancy . The major concern adverse effect anemia pregnant woman offspring belief population great risk perinatal mortality morbidity . Apart , well know anemia per se associate high incidence premature birth low birth weight baby . Infants iron deficiency anemia significantly low motor mental score decrease language capability body balance-coordination skill . Such infant also decrease learning ability . Iron deficiency anemia developmental stage lead reduce myelination spinal cord , well change myelin composition ; abnormalities neurotransmitter ' metabolism alteration brain energy metabolism . The Neurobehavioral Assessments Preterm Infants ( NAPI ) research tool monitor developmental progress differential maturity preterm infant range 32weeks 37weeks ( full term ) . This test use identify persistent lag development , research tool ass effect intervention study individual difference basic developmental question . The reliability clinical validity test thoroughly investigate normative data establish . Objective - To evaluate neurobehavioral development 37weeks post conceptional age late preterm infant born mother hemoglobin &lt; 11gm/dl ; standardise scale - Neurobehavioral Assessment Preterm Infants ( NAPI ) .</detailed_description>
