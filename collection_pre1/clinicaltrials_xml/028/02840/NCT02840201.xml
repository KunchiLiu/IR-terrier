	<brief_title>Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation Biomarker Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac rhythm disorder worldwide , gain prevalence . Currently , treatment atrial fibrillation concentrate patient exist atrial fibrillation , reduction risk complication stroke anticoagulation . Furthermore , mechanical intervention atrial ablation procedure fraught inconsistent result . The availability serum base biomarkers predict early onset atrial fibrillation , also ability prognosticate risk , may help identification patient risk AF complication early . This would also allow identification patient population suitable evaluation possible future intervention strategy prevent onset atrial fibrillation , alter natural history complication . Currently best biomarkers predict atrial fibrillation risk fact marker heart failure - NTproBNP high sensitivity troponin . These marker independent CHA2DS2-VASc score . While helpful , marker able distinguish 2 condition heart failure atrial fibrillation often co-exist . The investigator 's Cardiovascular Biomarker Discovery Translation team use deep proteomic analysis human tissue reprogrammed human stem cell identify novel candidate biomarkers . This successfully apply diastolic heart failure , several new marker condition validate across 3 population . The investigator several potential candidate atrial fibrillation , validation appropriate cohort , particularly early risk atrial fibrillation , important . The ARTESiA study ideal study set perform biomarker validation , parent trial recruit patient silent atrial fibrillation detect dual-chamber pacemaker , defibrillator insertable cardiac monitor . This would constitute potentially early stage atrial fibrillation patient cohort , know subsequent risk prospective fashion . The prospective evaluation approve medication aspirin apixaban also helpful determine prospective biomarker informative potential efficacy treatment , unchanged treatment modality .</detailed_description>
