	<brief_summary>We investigate way reduce pain abdominoplasty . We hypothesize injection Dysport ( botulinum toxin A ) rectus abdominis , abdominal wall musculature , abdominoplasty provide effective , longer last method pain control standard care alone ( use Exparel ( liposomal bupivacaine ) intraoperatively follow PRN narcotic .

	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Post Abdominoplasty Pain Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain control abdominoplasty important aspect patient ' post-operative experience . Several method , include use pain pump , regional block , liposomal bupivacaine , reduce post-abdominoplasty pain describe ( 1-4 ) . The use technique reduce report postoperative pain , narcotic requirement , time ambulation / normal activity vary degree . Unfortunately , technique without potential complication limitation ( e.g . seroma , cost , inconvenience , short effect ) . Botulinum toxin A ( BT ) neuromuscular block agent derive bacterium Clostridium botulinum type A . It act inhibit release acetylcholine neuromuscular junction . Botulinum toxin A use mollify chronic pain ( 5-7 ) , also show reduce pain associate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction breast augmentation inject pectoralis muscle ( 8-10 ) . Although exact mechanism BT reduce pain clear , may alter sensitivity response muscle nociceptors cholinergic signal ( 11 ) . Injection BT abdominal wall musculature ( rectus abdominis , external internal oblique , transversus abdominis ) direction visualization may provide safe , effective , longer last method pain control previously describe technique . This exploratory , randomize pilot study patient blind treatment management pain abdominoplasty . There two study arm : ( 1 ) patient receive intramuscular injection intraoperative BT + standard care ( 2 ) patient receive intraoperative saline placebo + standard care ( control ) . Microsoft Excel use create random list 100 number 50 number designate arm 1 treatment group 50 designate arm 2 treatment group . These print place envelope treatment group inside patient number outside . Patients see clinic preoperatively give informed consent assign treatment envelope nurse , keep patient 's chart . Both patient nurse blind treatment group . Intraoperatively , envelope open used identify patient 's treatment OR nurse surgeon , administer treatment clinically appropriate prior wound closure , either botulinum toxin equivalent dose saline alone . Botulinum toxin A ( Brand : Dysport ) , 300 U , dilute 20 mL normal saline . The treatment inject rectus abdominis fascia along length . The treatment give record patient 's chart . Immediately post-operatively prior discharge , patient ask complete questionnaire ( attach ) , assess pain use visual analog pain scale 1-10 . After discharge , patient ask record daily opioid use give questionnaire assess pain , time return ambulation , time return `` normal '' activity . This complete initial post-operative visit via phone call record nurse blind treatment group . Assessment attempt weekly first month office phone bimonthly afterwards follow two month . We follow patient duration BT begin work within six hour administration maximum effect seven 14 day . Abdominoplasty perform operative surgeon use technique throughout duration study . There additional cost patient . All deidentified data store RedCap , secure web application . Study Population : The study population include non-pregnant , non-nursing patient age 18 year ability provide inform consent , undergo abdominoplasty treat surgeon 's outpatient surgical center . Exclusion criterion include history pre-existing neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis , Eaton-Lambert syndrome , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , hypersensitivity allergy Dysport , use aminoglycosides time surgery ( antibiotic potentiate effect BT ) , report use BT four month precede surgery , daily pre-operative opioid use , skin infection plan surgical site . Study drug / Interventions : Dysport ( abobotulinumtoxinA ) injection , intramuscular use . Once reconstitute , must store 2-8°C , protected light , use within 24 hour . For Injection : 300 Units 500 Units lyophilize powder single-use vial reconstitution preservative -free 0.9 % Sodium Chloride . Study Schedule/Timeline : After IRB approval , approximately two patient undergo abdominoplasty per month subsequent two year . After follow-up period three month , anticipate study conclude approximately 2-2.5 year . Statistical Analysis Plan : Randomization Eligible consenting patient randomize intervention control group use 1:1 allocation ratio . The surgical team randomly select sealed envelope contain treatment allocation administer respective treatment . The data collector data analyst blind group allocation . Power Sample size A power analysis base difference baseline 8 week observation . If assume treatment group common standard deviation 1.25 , 52 subject would need recruit order observe 1 difference change base two-sample t-test perform 0.05 level 80 % power . It assume dropout rate 10 % , thus , 58 total subject recruit . This sample size estimate likely conservative , intention-to-treat analysis perform high power analysis use determine sample size since dropout longitudinal information use analysis . Analysis plan All analyse perform accordance CONSORT Statement . Patient demographic outcomes variable summarize mean standard deviation , median interquartile range , frequency percentage . The distribution demographic outcome variable compare treatment group use t-tests Wilcoxon test , chi-square test , log-rank test ( time-to-event outcome ) . We analyze data follow intention-to-treat principle . The primary study aim compare intervention control group make use repeated-measures ANOVA model contain time , intervention group , interaction two variable . Estimates difference study group accompany correspond two-sided 95 % confidence interval , adjust multiple comparison omnibus test difference treatment group time point indicate difference . This analysis adjust covariates either balanced randomization significant relationship outcome . A similar model use ass relationship opium daily dose treatment group . A Cox proportional hazard model use compare time return work activity intervention group . The aforementioned analysis require assumption . In event assumption meet , transformation alternate analysis consider . All statistical test perform use two-sided test 0.05 significance level SAS® 9.4 ( 2 ) . 1 .
