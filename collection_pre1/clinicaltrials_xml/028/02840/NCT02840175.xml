	<brief_title>Treatment Tapering JIA With Inactive Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) characterize chronic arthritis unknown etiology start age 16 . There four five thousand paediatric patient JIA France . Most patient diagnose oligoarticular rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular JIA . The prognosis disease dramatically improve thanks introduction biologic agent patient extend oligoarticular rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular JIA inadequate response methotrexate . Inactive disease long-lasting clinical remission achieve case . `` Treat target '' approach increasingly recommend , early introduction biologics , however way taper withdraw treatment patient achieve inactive disease codify . As biologic treatment expensive associate concern regard long-term safety , study aim test , randomize fashion , hypothesis early tapering biologic agent ( i.e . increase interval injection soon inactive disease document ) safe non-inferior maintenance stable treatment intensity 24 week , therefore test possibility early biologic agent withdrawal . It also study concentration different biological agent , occurrence anti-drugs antibody taper withdraw biologics , possible association high risk relapse . In addition , investigator test serum level protein 100 ( MRP8/14 ) could predictive flare . Finally , pharmaco-economic analysis quality life study conduct .</detailed_description>
