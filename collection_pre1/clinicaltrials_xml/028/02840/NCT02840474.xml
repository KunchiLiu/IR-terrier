	<brief_summary>Background : The human body use antibody one way help fight infection . VRC01LS antibody direct HIV virus . Researchers want see safe well tolerate . They study amount VRC01LS body change time . They check see people get VRC01LS develop immune response . Objective : To see VRC01LS safe well tolerate . Eligibility : Adults age 18 70 HIV infected otherwise healthy . Females able get pregnant must willing use birth control study . Design : Participants screen another protocol . Participants get study drug one time , IV infusion . A needle guide thin tube vein . The study drug mixed salt water drip vein 30 minute . Participants monitor 30 minute infusion . Blood sample take follow time : Once infusion 5 time 4 hour infusion 1 time 24 hour infusion . Some participant may 3 optional blood draws time period 4 24 hour . For 3 day infusion , participant write temperature symptom diary . There total 23 study visit 48 week . Ten visit first 4 week . At visit , participant answer health question give blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VRC 607 : A Phase 1 , Single Dose Study Safety Virologic Effect Human Monoclonal Antibody , VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB ( VRC01LS ) , Broad HIV-1 Neutralizing Activity , Administered Intravenously HIV-Infected Adults . Study Design : This first study VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB ( VRC01LS ) monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) HIV-infected viremic adult . It study examine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) virologic impact VRC01LS . The primary hypothesis VRC01LS safe intravenous administration HIV-1-infected adult elicit hypersensitivity reaction . The secondary hypothesis VRC01LS detectable human serum definable half-life . Product Description : VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB ( VRC01LS ) human MAb target CD4 bind site HIV-1 . VRC01LS modification VRC01 MAb ( show safe antiviral activity human study ) addition LS , 2-amino acid mutation design improve half-life antibody . There change Fab binding site . It develop manufacture VRC/NIAID/NIH cGMP VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operate contract Vaccine Clinical Materials Program ( VCMP ) , Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc. , Frederick , MD . Vials provide 100 mg/mL . Subjects : HIV-1-infected viremic adult ; 18-70 year age . Study Plan : This open-label , single dose study assess VRC01LS administer 40 mg/kg IV HIVinfected viremic subject . Safety lab sample , HIV viral load , CD4 count , PK sample blood sample human anti-VRC01LS antibody detection drawn baseline interval throughout study . Subjects keep daily diary reactogenicity symptom 3 day study product administration query study visit adverse event . VRC 607 Study Schema : Subjects-10 ( *The expect enrollment 10 subject . Up 20 subject may enrol event subject complete sample schedule , additional PK evaluation need , additional subject need safety evaluation ) Administration Schedule-Day 0 ; 40 mg/kg IV Study Duration : Subjects follow 48 week study product administration .</detailed_description>
