	<brief_summary>Background : People Williams Syndrome ( WS ) supravalvular aortic stenosis ( SVAS ) less elasticity blood vessel . This call blood vessel stiffness . Blood vessel may focal narrowing call stenosis may globally narrow . Objectives : Researchers want see blood vessel difference people Williams Syndrome supravalvular aortic stenosis affect organ body include heart , gut , kidney , brain . Eligibility : People age 5-85 WS SVAS Healthy volunteer age 5-85 Design : - Participants yearly visit 10 year . All participant offer test . - Participants give consent study team review medical record . If participant child adult WS , parent guardian give consent . - Participants visit NIH physical exam medical history . Based health history , participant undergo series image test measure blood vessel function course 2-4 day . Tests cognitive abilites also perform . Blood drawn IV may place specific test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Elastin Mediated Vascular Stiffness End Organs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elasticity aorta buffer body damage due pulsatile blood flow . Data human mice show increase age , vessel lose elasticity become stiff . Vascular stiffness associate progressive cognitive impairment dementia age adult , little known effect early-onset/congenital vascular stiffness . Similarly , elastin-mediated arteriopathy form stenosis potential impact additional end organ heart , lung , gut , skeletal muscle kidney cause feed exercise intolerance , well hypertension . This study evaluate impact elastin arteriopathy vascular stiffness end organ . Following consent , investigator work subject caregiver determine test appropriate patient base age/capabilities preference : - complete formal test cognitive neurobehavioral ability - undergo non-invasive measurement vascular stiffness - undergo brain image MRI - undergo echocardiogram - undergo ECG - undergo 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitor - undergo ultrasound image flow study various vascular bed tissue - undergo CT angiogram relevant vessel - undergo non-invasive tissue oxygenation endothelial functional assessment near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) - perform 6 minute walk test - perform pulmonary function test - receive eye exam Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) - give blood/urine relevant laboratories - evaluate biomechanical property skin - complete medica photography evaluate relevant feature condition Additionally , study request permission review participant 's medical record obtain additional information general cardiovascular health . For individual supravalvular aortic stenosis ( SVAS ) Williams syndrome ( WS ) , clinical report confirm individual diagnosis review .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We recruit individual WS SVAS demographically similar control ( unaffected ) participant . Children adults WS must : age 5 85 presume confirm diagnosis WS parent/guardian available provide consent assist answer medical question Children adult SVAS must : age 5 85 clinical feature suggestive SVAS SVASlike condition OR clinical feature SVAS SVASlike condition genetic testing result imply affected status ( SVAS decrease penetrance ) . parent/guardian available provide consent assist answer medical question minor ( applicable adult ) Children adult participate study part control group must : age 5 85 Not clinical feature genetic profile suggestive WS , SVAS SVASlike condition parent/guardian available provide consent assist answer medical question minor ( applicable adult ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion ( WUSM ) : Individual must able undergo MRI . If medically unable complete task , exclude study .</criteria>
