	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis disease-free survival improve patient undergo resection tumor think stage I-III primary non-small cell lung cancer patient combine general-epidural anesthesia &amp; analgesia compare patient receive general anesthesia postoperative patient-controlled opioid analgesia . Patients surgery resection potentially curable lung cancer randomize combine general epidural anesthesia general anesthesia opioid analgesia .

	<brief_title>The Effect Combined General/Regional Anesthesia Cancer Recurrence Patients Having Lung Cancer Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery primary treatment lung cancer , surgery release tumor cell systemic circulation . Whether minimal residual disease result clinical metastasis function host defense . At least three perioperative factor shift balance toward initiation progression minimal residual disease . 1 . Surgery per se depress cell-mediated immunity , reduces concentration tumor-related anti-angiogenic factor ( e.g. , angiostatin endostatin ) , increase concentration pro-angiogenic factor VEGF . 2 . Anesthesia impair numerous immune function , include neutrophil , macrophage , dendritic cell , T-cell , NK-cell function . 3 . Opioid analgesic inhibit cellular humoral immune function human , promote tumor growth rodent . The primary hypothesis disease-free survival improve patient undergo resection tumor think stage I-III primary non-small cell lung cancer patient combine general-epidural anesthesia &amp; analgesia compare patient receive general anesthesia postoperative patient-controlled opioid analgesia . Patients surgery resection potentially curable lung cancer randomize combine general epidural anesthesia general anesthesia opioid analgesia . The primary outcome disease-free survival . The effect combine epidural/general anesthesia versus general anesthesia opioid analgesia primary outcome disease-free survival ( time earlier recurrence death cause ) assess uni-variably Kaplan-Meier analysis multivariably ( primary analysis ) Cox proportional hazard regression model adjust know risk factor recurrence , include tumor stage , size tumor , age , sex , receipt chemotherapy surgery , clinical site . As usual type analysis , stop criterion base number outcome event rather enrollment .</detailed_description>
