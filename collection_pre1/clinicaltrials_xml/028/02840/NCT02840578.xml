	<brief_title>NK Cell Activity Smokers Screened Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer mortality United States . Despite considerable clinical research multi-modality cancer treatment , significant decrease lung cancer-specific mortality past three decade . The recent result National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) establish screen high-risk individual use low-dose CT ( LDCT ) significantly reduce lung cancer-related mortality . One caveat approximately 96 % `` positive '' result NLST find related lung cancer . The difficulty determine subject suspicious lesion biopsied operate could alleviate development highly specific lung cancer biomarkers could complement LDCT . Thus , novel , complementary , non-invasive diagnostic tool high sensitivity specificity would clearly enormous benefit patient `` positive '' screen exam . This study look measure activity natural killer ( NK ) cell use vitro diagnostic device NK Vue™ cohort current former smoker ( n=100 ) meet criterion LDCT screen establish National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) result positive finding NLST . This project aim measure NK cell activity , may eventually help reduce false positive rate LDCT screening , improve early detection lung cancer , assist risk assessment patient lung cancer . The Investigators hypothesize measurement NK cell activity may useful tool assess change immunosurveillance patient condition disease NK cell activity show reduce , lung cancer . Objectives Specific Aim 1 : To examine whether NK cell activity associate two confirmed risk factor : ( 1 ) presence indeterminate lung nodule ( ) ( 2 ) smoking exposure control potential confounders , include age , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , personal history cancer , family history cancer . Specific Aim 2 ( Exploratory ) : In study cohort , investigator expect approximately 45 % patient least one indeterminate lung nodule . Among lung nodule ( ) , investigator examine whether NK cell activity associate size large lung nodule control potential confounders , include smoking exposure , age , gender , BMI , personal history cancer , family history cancer</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At time registration , subject must current previous cumulative cigarette smoke history ≥ 20 pack year ( pack per day multiply number year smoke ) . If smoking history 20 29 pack year , subject must additional risk factor ( i.e . radon exposure , occupational exposure , personal history smokingassociated cancer , family history lung cancer firstdegree relative , COPD pulmonary fibrosis ) . At time registration former smoker without additional risk factor ( ) must quit smoking within precede 15 year . Subjects must willing provide blood sample biospecimens study . At time registration , subject must recover toxic effect prior therapy : ≥6 month ( 182 day ) last dose prior cytotoxic therapy . At time registration , subject must recover effect prior pneumonia acute respiratory infection treat antibiotic physician : ≥12 week ( 84 day ) first dose antibiotic . Medical psychiatric condition precluding inform medical consent . Prior history lung cancer .
