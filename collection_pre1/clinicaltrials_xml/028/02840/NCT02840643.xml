	<brief_summary>To examine efficacy combine unimanual bimanual intensive therapy child unilateral brain injury . A key question hemiplegia therapy whether affected hand train alone tandem hand . In constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) , participant 's less-affected upper extremity restrict sling , cast , mitt , participant actively use affected arm hand skill-based therapeutic activity . Bimanual therapy , contrast , engage hand therapeutic movement . Since constraint bimanual therapy target different aspect hand use , could synergistic effect hand function give combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Constraint Therapy Bimanual Therapy Children With Unilateral Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children hemiplegia give intensive hand therapy protocol six week ( 6 hrs/day , 5 days/week - total 180 hour . Therapy give two block . In one block ( 3 week , 90 hour therapy ) , child receive constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) , also know constraint therapy . During CIMT , child wear mitt less-affected hand , restrict use hand . Children engage intensive therapy improve active range motion , strength , motor control sensory awareness affect hand . Activities functional play base . Daily structure therapy include : morning gym , fine motor , gross motor , sensory motor , therapeutic feeding , sport self care activity . During training , child perform play-based functional activity affect hand . Example activity include play card board game , art craft , activity provide sensory stimulation affect hand , finger painting . Activities also include stretch strengthen exercise . In one block ( 3 week , 90 hour therapy ) , child receive bimanual therapy . During bimanual therapy , child wear mitt less-affected hand . Children provide individualized activity facilitate active use hand . Therapists adapt grade activity guide child problem solve success . Bimanual activity include self-care ( tie shoe , zippering , cut food ) , sport activity , manipulation classroom tool ( cut scissors ) . Before intervention begin , child randomize one two arm . In Arm 1 , child receive 3 week CIMT follow 3 week bimanual therapy . In Arm 2 , child receive 3 week bimanual therapy follow 3 week CIMT .</detailed_description>
