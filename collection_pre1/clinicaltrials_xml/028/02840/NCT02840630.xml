	<brief_summary>The investigator recruit non-diabetic volunteer ( n=30 ) diabetic volunteer control diet lifestyle ( n=300 ) . The non-diabetic volunteer non-diabetic group diabetic volunteer randomise diabetic control intervention group diabetic fish intervention group . Baseline data collect three group diabetic control intervention group diabetic fish intervention group go 16-week study . This allow investigator compare metabolic health across South Asian population people without diabetes . The recommended intake EPA DHA daily ~450 mg per day cardiovascular health , approximately 3 g per week . Over course 16 week , subject diabetic control intervention group continue habitual diet , subject diabetic fish intervention group receive two 125 g portion tin mackerel ( contain 7.8 g n-3 LCPUFA26 ) every week , replace portion red meat poultry . Previous n-3 LCPUFA intervention study among South Asian people United Kingdom able reverse lipid abnormality supplementation 2.5 g EPA DHA per day 12 week . However , study also show daily consumption EPA DHA 68±99 112±171 mg respectively . Therefore , 1.1 g n-3 LCPUFA per day give study increase compliance . Recipe recommendation use mackerel provide . Non-diabetic volunteer recruit obtain baseline data order compare metabolic profile diabetic volunteer . This allow u investigate link omega 3 status glycaemic control South Asian population . Fish choose intervention oppose EPA DHA supplement order capture benefit eat fish important source n-3 LCPUFA , also key nutrient vitamin D , selenium iodine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During study period , participant ask maintain routine dietary social habit avoid change body weight . In addition volunteer ask record weight first thing morning set scale every week . Any change document food frequency questionnaire . Volunteers without diabetes recruit baseline data involve 16-week intervention study . Diabetic volunteer randomize BioSS batch ~20 people diabetic control diabetic fish intervention group match gender , age BMI . The diabetic control group ask continue routine dietary habit diabetic fish intervention group ask substitute poultry red meat 2 tin mackerels week . Study kit post two week study initiate consent volunteer . All volunteer ask provide finger prick blood spot filter paper week 0 , subject allocate diabetic control diabetic fish intervention group ask provide blood spot week 8 16 . A dried blood spot ( DBS ) sample kit contain two Whatman 903 filter paper , two lancet , alcohol pad , bandaids , guideline spot blood filter paper , prepay envelope , FFQ , tin mackerel fish recipe book . Every volunteer ask prick inside tip non-dominant finger gently spot total ten circle filter paper . A volunteer might experience slight discomfort lancet go finger . The volunteer allow filter paper dry hour closing flap filter paper . All information tool help obtain dry blood spot , well guideline spot blood filter paper include DBS kit . Volunteers require spot 2 filter paper one collection point post pre-paid envelope complete return address . The DBS sample analyze omega 3 index , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , triglyceride , Vitamin D status , genetic ( TCF7L2 7903146 ) epigenetic marker ( FADS 174546 ) lipid glucose control .</detailed_description>
