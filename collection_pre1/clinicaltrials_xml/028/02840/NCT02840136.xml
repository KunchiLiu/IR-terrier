	<brief_summary>In trial , various factor may influence antibiotic concentration measure sputum cystic fibrosis patient study . A first factor aerosol use . As cystic fibrosis patient often use aerosol , hypertonic saline , dilution antibiotic sputum expect . The extent dilution unknown determine compare sputum sample collect use aerosol . A second factor homogeneity antibiotic within one sputum sample . Multiple aliquot sputum sample compare . A third factor variability several sputum sample collect drainage session . The antibiotic concentration 3 separate sputum sample compare . The final goal standardise sputum sample collection processing sample ensure accurate concentration measurement sputum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LC-MS/MS Based Method Development Monitoring Antibiotic Concentrations Sputum Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotic therapy cornerstone management cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Nevertheless , little research focus actual concentration reach lung secretion CF patient . As pathogen cause expedited decline lung function primarily reside lung secretion , many physician interested data . Therefore , develop validate liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy ( UPLC-MS/MS ) method quantify intravenous administer beta-lactam antibiotic ceftazidime , piperacillin meropenem , well inhaled aztreonam sputum CF patient . Besides validated analytical method , sample collection sample preparation need standardise well ensure accurate concentration measurement . In trial , three factor may cause bias concentration measurement sputum study use sputum patient receive therapy one IV antibiotic . A first factor aerosol use . As cystic fibrosis patient often use aerosol , hypertonic saline , Ventolin Pulmozyme , dilution antibiotic sputum expect . Likely , moment patient use aerosol need consider collection sputum antibiotic concentration measurement . To investigate extent duration concentration change induce aerosol use , sputum sample collect aerosol use right completion aerosol well 30 min , 1h 2h completion aerosol , sample collect . A second factor homogeneity antibiotic within one sputum sample . Sputum sample generally heterogeneous appearance . To investigate distribution antibiotic heterogeneous well , concentration multiple aliquot sputum sample compare . Five aliquot test remain sputum homogenise analyse well . A third factor variability several sputum sample collect autogenous drainage session . A drainage session lead physiotherapist take approximately 30 minute aim loosen remove thick lung secretion much possible . It assume sputum spontaneously expectorated drainage session originate different part lung . To verify antibiotic homogeneously heterogeneously distribute lung , sputum sample collect beginning , middle end drainage session . The antibiotic concentration 3 separate sputum sample compare . The data originate 3 test allow standardise time point sample collection respect aerosol therapy autogenous drainage well evaluate homogenisation collect sample necessary .</detailed_description>
