	<brief_summary>This single center , open-label , non-randomized , 1:1 parallel control single dose administration study design . Healthy subject match severe renal function impair ( eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimate ) subject age , gender weight parallel control , match healthy normal renal function accord subject impaired renal function , enrollment subject severe impaired renal function ( eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimate ) . Renal function impair group control group receive orally single-dose nemonoxacin malate capsule ( 0.5g ) . Collect blood urine sample administration perform pharmacokinetic analysis safety observation .</brief_summary>
