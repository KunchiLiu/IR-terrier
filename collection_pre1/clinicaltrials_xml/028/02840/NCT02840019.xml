	<brief_summary>The goal Advanced Fetal Imaging - Phase II advance fetal MRI image design MRI coil specifically pregnant woman test recently develop MRI image acquisition technique . The investigator aim reliably obtain high quality fetal MRI image compare current clinical fetal MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Fetal Imaging - Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim project evaluate optimize exist clinical magnetic resonance ( MR ) techniques fetal imaging , also implement test new MR technology would improve fetal image general . This involve development new pulse sequence image acquisition scheme `` freeze '' fetal motion hence provide improve image quality robustness structural ( T1- T2- weight , susceptibility FLAIR image ) physiological imaging ( diffusion , perfusion , spectroscopy , resting-state functional MRI , etc ) . The scope project also include test newly develop radio frequency ( RF ) receive-only coil array would inherently provide mean faster image fetus , thus complement software development .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>60 Minute Full Research MRI Scan : Gestational age 18 40 week AND Pregnant woman healthy pregnancy OR Pregnant woman concern fetal/placental abnormality refer clinical fetal MRI obstetrician OR Pregnant woman concern fetal/placental abnormality NOT refer clinical fetal MRI obstetrician 15 Minute AddOn Research Scan : Gestational age 18 40 week AND Pregnant woman concern fetal abnormality refer clinical fetal MRI obstetrician AND The clinical fetal MRI occur Boston Children 's Hospital Pregnant woman contraindication MRI ( implant metal , nonremovable piercings , pacemaker , etc ) Pregnant woman claustrophobic Pregnant woman medically unstable MRI</criteria>
