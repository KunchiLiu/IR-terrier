	<detailed_description>Asthma high prevalence morbidity among adolescent , especially urban Hispanic African American teenager . Despite , intervention specifically target adolescent . School-based web-based asthma intervention show effective young child , yet develop tested adolescent . Investigators develop Camp Air , engage dynamic e-learning intervention help adolescent uncontrolled asthma manage illness improve asthma control . Camp Air consist seven online module one module complete week seven week . Each module provide brief introduction topic strategy focus module follow set interactive exercise game practice personalize feedback . The investigator conduct two group randomize pilot trial 80 , 9th - 12th grader uncontrolled asthma order ( ) assess preliminary intervention effect Camp Air , ( b ) evaluate feasibility acceptability Camp Air . In order evaluate CAMP Air 's utility school- home-based intervention , adolescent enrol two site : 1 ) NYC public school ( n=up 38 ) , 2 ) national asthma community large ( n=up 42 ) . Investigators also evaluate reach , acceptability , generalizability , sustainability Camp Air use RE-AIM approach . Investigators hypothesize one month post-intervention , relative control , Camp Air participant show significantly great improvement asthma-related outcome . Investigators also hypothesize rating software usage index demonstrate Camp Air feasible , usable , acceptable intervention use adolescent . Investigators also explore evidence dose-response participant spend time engage e-training material show great positive change .</detailed_description>
