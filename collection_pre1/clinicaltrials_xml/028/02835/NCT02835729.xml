	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize regimen limit toxicity ( RLT ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) indoximod patient newly diagnose AML receive remission induction chemotherapy cytarabine idarubicin . Safety tolerability Indoximod also evaluate RP2D combination standard-of-care ( SOC ) chemotherapy ( defined induction therapy idarubicin cytarabine consolidation high-dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) trial ) follow single agent indoximod maintenance therapy patient newly diagnose AML compare safety tolerability SOC chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
