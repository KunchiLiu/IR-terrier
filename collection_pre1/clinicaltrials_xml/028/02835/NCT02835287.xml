	<detailed_description>Diabetes reach epidemic proportion China . Most patient diabetes multiple uncontrolled cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor due suboptimal care , especially underserved population . The overall objective propose cluster randomize trial test whether implementation protocol-based integrate care improve CVD risk factor ( glycated hemoglobin [ HbA1C ] , systolic blood pressure [ SBP ] , LDL-cholesterol ) 18 month reduce major CVD event ( non-fatal stroke , non-fatal myocardial infarction , hospitalize heart failure , CVD mortality ) 3 year among patient type 2 diabetes additional CVD risk factor clinical CVD compare usual care community clinic Xiamen , China . The protocol-based integrated care , provide standardize , combine , multi-component intervention accord clinical guideline treatment algorithm diabetes comorbidities community clinic , deliver train primary care physician , health manager , nurse support diabetes specialist . The propose trial recruit 11,780 patient diabetes additional CVD risk factor clinical CVD 38 community-based primary care clinic ( community health service center ) Xiamen , China . Nineteen community clinic approximately 310 participant randomly assign intervention group 19 community clinic similar participant control group match administrative district socioeconomic status . The protocol-based integrated care intervention last 36 month . HbA1C , BP , LDL-cholesterol , variable , co-morbidities measure baseline follow-up visit month 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 . In phase 1 ( first 18-month intervention ) , primary outcome difference combine change HbA1C , SBP , LDL-cholesterol level intervention control group , simultaneously model use scaled marginal model allow estimation single overall treatment effect . In phase 2 ( three-year intervention ) , primary outcome difference major CVD incidence ( non-fatal stroke , non-fatal myocardial infarction , hospitalize heart failure , CVD mortality ) intervention control group . The secondary outcome include : ( 1 ) net change HbA1C , SBP , LDL-cholesterol individually ; ( 2 ) estimate 10-year risk CVD ; ( 3 ) proportion participant HbA1C &lt; 7 % ( &lt; 7.5 % clinical CVD ) , BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg , LDL-cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dL ; ( 4 ) health-related quality life ; ( 5 ) cost-effectiveness intervention three year . The propose trial design provide 90 % statistical power detect 3.6 % reduction combine change HbA1C , SBP , LDL-cholesterol level phase 1 20 % reduction major CVD ( non-fatal stroke , non-fatal myocardial infarction , hospitalize heart failure , CVD mortality ) phase 2 significance level 0.05 two-sided test . This first randomized cluster trial test implementation protocol-based integrated care program multiple CVD risk factor CVD event diabetes patient receive care community clinic China . This implementation research project high impact public health generate urgently need data effective , practical , sustainable intervention program aim reduce CVD burden among diabetes patient middle- low-income country .</detailed_description>
