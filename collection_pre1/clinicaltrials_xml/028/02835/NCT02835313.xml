	<detailed_description>As group , stroke survivor physically inactive even sedentary old adult . Lack physical activity serious consequence person stroke , include increase risk recurrent stroke , develop disease mortality . Current rehabilitation intervention little improve real-world walking activity stroke , suggest simply improve walk capacity sufficient improve daily physical activity stroke . Rather , investigator 's hypothesize combination fast walk intervention improve walk capacity , step activity monitor program facilitates translation gain clinic `` real-world '' , would generate great improvement real world walk activity either intervention alone . Data investigator 's lab provide support hypothesis ; however , suggest great efficacy combine 2 intervention depend participant 's initial walking activity . Thus , investigator 's expect one intervention superior others participant , rather combine intervention superior low level baseline walk activity , speed endurance . The specific objective study test whether combine fast walk train step activity monitor program ( FAST+SAM ) superior improve real-world walking activity compare fast walk train alone ( FAST ) step activity monitor feedback program alone ( SAM ) chronic stroke . Using randomize controlled experimental design , 225 chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) stroke survivor , complete 12 week fast walk training ( FAST ) , step activity monitor program ( SAM ) fast walk train + step activity monitor program ( FAST+SAM ) . Moderation specific intervention outcome baseline characteristic evaluate determine intervention effective .</detailed_description>
