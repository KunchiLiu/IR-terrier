	<detailed_description>Background Fluid resuscitation cornerstone pediatric shock management ; current practice fluid resuscitation child evidence base . Emerging data strongly indicate increase incidence hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis consequently , acute kidney injury associate infusion large volume normal saline critically ill adult shock . Balanced salt solution crystalloids , composition resemble plasma low chloride concentration normal saline , clearly decrease risk hyperchloremia metabolic acidosis adult well pediatric study use peri-operative period . In adult patient , two solution compare various setting well traumatic brain injury shock . The result favor balanced solution comparison normal saline . However , non-surgical setting paucity evidence use solution child shock evidence need generate support refute use fluid compare normal saline . Objectives Primary To examine use 'balanced salt solution '' result low incidence acute kidney injury ( defined increase serum creatinine &gt; 0.3mg/dL within 48 hour 1.5 time baseline within last 7 day urine output le 0.5 mL/kg/h 6 hour ) first seven day initial fluid resuscitation compare Normal saline . Secondary To evaluate difference , two fluid type regard follow secondary objective : 1 . Incidence hyperchloremia ( define serum chloride level &gt; 108 mEq/L ) 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hr 7 day fluid resuscitation . 2 . Change arterial pH baseline , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hr 7 day fluid resuscitation . 3 . Change serum bicarbonate baseline , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hr 7 day fluid resuscitation . 4 . Requirement fluid bolus first 6 hrs total fluid first 24 hour . 5 . Proportion patient achieve pre-determined therapeutic end point 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour day 7 fluid resuscitation . 6 . Need inotrope therapy first 7 day . 7 . Change SOFA score PELOD score 24 hour , 48 , 72 hour 7 day . 8 . Time resolution AKI . 9 . In- ICU mortality rate . Site study Pediatric emergency PICU , Department Pediatrics , All India Institute medical Sciences , New Delhi Proposed site PGIMER , Chandigarh JIPMER Puducherry Study Design Randomized control trial ( safety superiority kidney injury ) . Multicenter trial . Study Duration 3 year Study definition Septic shock define child suspect infection manifest hypothermia hyperthermia least two clinical sign decrease perfusion without hypotension decrease mental status , prolong capillary refill &gt; 2 sec ( cold shock ) flash capillary refill ( warm shock ) , diminish ( cold shock ) bounding ( warm shock ) peripheral pulse , mottle cool extremity ( cold shock ) , decrease urine output &lt; 1 ml/kg/hr ) . Therapeutic end point - Normal heart rate - Appropriate-for-age mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) measure non-invasively ; - Normal pulse difference peripheral central pulse , warm extremity ; - Capillary refill time &lt; 2 second ; - Normal mental status ; - Urine output ≥ 1mL/kg/hr , - A decrease trend serum lactate time admission Hyperchloremia : Defined serum chloride value ≥108 meq/L , base laboratory cut 98-108 meq/L Metabolic acidosis : pH le 7.35 serum bicarbonate &lt; 24 meq/L low normal pCO2 ( &lt; 40 mm Hg ) Acute kidney injury : An abrupt ( within 48-hr ) reduction kidney function define absolute increase serum creatinine equal 0.3 mg/dl , increase serum creatinine equal 1.5 fold baseline , reduction urine output ( oliguria less 0.5 ml/kg per hour &gt; 6-hr ) . Enrollment All child feature shock per standard definition screen eligibility . Of , child require least one fluid bolus 20 ml/kg enrol . The eligible participant would enrol obtain informed consent one parent . Randomization Once enrol , participant would randomize 2 group . 'Group 1 ' 'study group ' receive balance fluid 'Group 2 ' 'control group ' receive normal saline . Process randomization do investigator role collect baseline variable , apply intervention analysis outcome ( ) . Block randomization do vary block size 2 8 . The random number table generate computer software would use purpose . Sample size estimation The investigator calculate sample size 354 patient group ( 708 total ) would require detect absolute reduction incidence AKI 25 % ( current incidence child shock unit ) 15 % assume two-sided α level 0.05 statistical power 90 % . The sample size calculate use Stata 11 . The investigator expect require sample size collect within 3 year period three center .</detailed_description>
