Study Patient Selection Criteria Patients eligible include study meet follow criterion : 1 . ≥19 year age 2 . Patients primary diagnosis NSCLC within past 5 year eligible first systemic therapy base disease characteristic . Systemic therapy may include cytotoxic , target , immune-based , otherwise non-local treatment modality . Specific allowed setting include follow : - Incident metastatic disease ( stage IV ) undergo palliative therapy - Non-metastatic disease undergo adjuvant , neoadjuvant , concurrent chemoradiation either curative palliative intent - Recurrent subsequently metastatic disease ( stage ) 3 . Pathologic confirmation malignancy prior initiation first systemic therapy 4 . Patient agree submission archival biospecimen sample ( ) ( collect two year prior ) analysis 5 . Availability key variable time screen ( e.g . stage , demographic ) 6 . Have fully inform able provide write consent longitudinal follow-up agree accessible phone 7 . Patients may concurrently enrol unblinded clinical trial , blind clinical trial treatment administer unknown Patients exclude meet follow criterion : 1 . Pre-specified enrollment cap meet ( Figure 1 ) 2 . Suspected recurrent subsequently metastatic disease biopsy confirm prior receipt initial systemic therapy</detailed_description>
