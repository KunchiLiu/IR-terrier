	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation life-sustaining intervention premature infant respiratory difficulty . There relative consensus intubate provide positive pressure mechanical ventilation presence respiratory failure . In contrast , discontinuation mechanical ventilation recovery remain largely subjective . Typically 25 % infant weigh &lt; 1500g extubated use criterion require reintubation suggest ability clinician predict successful extubation limit . A potential predictive tool neonatal extubation Spontaneous Breathing Trial ( SBT ) . The efficacy SBT test use old patient population improve clinical judgment questionable neonatal population unique physiology , respiratory mechanic drive factor . Christiana Care Health System NICU currently use SBT standard part neonatal assessment extubation mechanical ventilation . The SBT use CCHS non-invasive 5-minute test perform intubated infant . Respiratory rate ( RR ) , expire tidal volume ( Vte ) , heart rate , oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) record . An SBT consider pass , apnea ( defined respiratory effort great 20 second ) , bradycardia ( define heart rate le 100 great 15 second ) , SpO2 maintain great 85 % SBT VE great 60 % mechanical VE . Potentially confound SBT , unstudied , effect position ( prone , supine , lateral ) . Similar adult , infant position significant effect efficacy spontaneous breathing . Infants CCHS NICU routinely care multiple position ( prone , supine , lateral ) throughout day . What unknown impact infant position SBT . An SBT perform one position may predict infant respiratory status extubation another position . Understanding impact infant position work breathing index independently combination SBT aid clinicians decision-making potentially decrease neonatal morbidity ( inaccuracy time safety extubation ) . This pilot study begin explore clinically relevant factor . Work breathing ( WOB ) indices non-invasively measure utilizing respiratory inductive plethysmography ( RIP ) . WOB index measure RIP utilized research team clinical research purpose , include CCHS . RIP entail infant breathe calmly wear soft elastic cloth band comfortably encircle rib cage abdomen . Contained within band flexible sinusoidal wire measure motion . Measurements take minimum 10 breath , preferable throughout duration 5 minute SBT . Objectives : This pilot study investigate ( 1 ) role infant position SBT score ( 2 ) relationship work breathing index reference SBT score infant position .</detailed_description>
