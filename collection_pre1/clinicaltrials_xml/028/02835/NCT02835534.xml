	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety rhTNK-tPA Comparison With Alteplase ( Rt-PA ) Fibrinolytic Therapy Acute STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include screen baseline , randomization &amp; intervention , in-hospital visit , 30±3 day visit fibrinolytic therapy . Following initial eligibility screen assessment , eligible patient sign informed consent randomly assign interactive Web-based central system fibrinolytic therapy either rhTNK-tPA rt-PA . The standard care give patient except study intervention . Prior fibrinolytic administration , enoxaparin ( 30-mg intravenous ) Un- Fractionated Heparin ( maximum 4000U , intravenous ) administer , combine antiplatelet therapy consist clopidogrel aspirin 300-mg loading dose follow routine dosage . Successful reperfusion accord clinical evidence ( EKG ) assess fibrinolytic therapy.TIMI flow assess patient 24 hour coronary angiography . MACCE bleed event follow document study 30 day fibrinolytic therap . An independent adjudication committee judge major endpoint event .</detailed_description>
