	<brief_summary>There several intervention program involve multisensory motor stimulation , gym , auditory , visual , vestibular tactile stimulation . We propose study continuous program early intervention involve preterm infant ' family first 12 month life take chance neuronal plasticity period . Preterm infant bear institution include complete 48 hour birth ( first intervention ) . All preterm infant mother follow neonatal period pre hospital discharge second intervention ( measure parental bond ) . After discharge conduct follow program divide low birth weight infant include study two group accord previous randomization : 1 . Standard care motor , cognition evaluation intervention accord need 2 . Program early intervention parent ' orientation independently f standard evaluation care perform . All phase neurodevelopment evaluate , parent orient stimulate motor , language cognition iteratively continuously home ; innovative method improve preterm neurodevelopment outcome . Randomization : neonatal period , preterm infant sequentially randomize complete 48 hour birth : Group 1- conventional group ( CG ) : standard care , accord routine care NICU ( skin-to skin care mother , kangaroo care ) . Group 2- intervention group ( IG ) : skin-to skin care mother ( kangaroo care ) plus massage therapy mother . They receive tactile-kinesthetic stimulation mother randomization hospital discharge . Intervention perform exclusively mother base study regard application skin stimulation passive exercise preterm infant . Both group receive skin-to skin care mother ( Kangaroo Care ) accord routine care neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main Goal develop program early intervention preterm infant allow family apply continuously home . An additional objective research quantify result early stimulation improvement cognition motor skill . Introduction- Born prematurely ( soon bear ) consequence cause major impact society health indicator population . According 2012 `` Born Too Soon : The Global Action Report Preterm Birth '' World Health Organization , Brazil rank 10th among country high number preterm live birth 16th death due complication prematurity . The data 2012 indicate approximately 3 million baby bear Brazil year , 350 000 born less 37 week gestation , bear prematurity index higher last three year , include preterm low birth weight infant gestational age ( GA ) less 32 week birth weight less 1500 gram ) . More half preterm infant birth weight less 1500 gram bear public university center Brazilian Neonatal network Research gestational age 23-33 week die discharge severe pulmonary , neurological ophthalmological complication . Early intervention high risk preterm infant must focus parents-infant relationship , environment behavioral attitude . It possible care process modify household beneficial neurodevelopment premature , cognitive aspect motor . Background Preterm infant high risk delay neurodevelopment . Early intervention program preterm infant focus development baby still hospital post discharge hospital , community setting may great impact long-term morbidity able focus family factor home environment . Interventions aim enhance parent-infant relationship focus sensitize family infant cue teach appropriate timely response preterm infant 's need , possibly early high-quality parent-infant mother-infant interaction positively influence cognitive social development child . Despite evidence , role family apply program home well study especially social deprived environment . The group randomization accord previous information summary . In NICU group receive skin-to skin care mother ( Kangaroo Care ) accord routine care NICU , The mother instruct perform one stage time , suppose end sequence within 15 min , four time per day interval 6 hours.The tactile stimulation perform cutaneous surface muscular area correspond temporal , frontal , periorbital , nasal perilabial region face ; external side upper low limb ; soft part two three finger group pass gently moderate pressure , three time one direction three time opposite direction . The kinesthetic stimulation consist passive exercise ( flexion extension ) upper low limb , one limb time three time articulation ( wrist , elbow , ankle knee ) ; one hand support stimulate limb hand perform movement . To ensure safe application intervention , mother IG instruct observe newborn ' tolerance sign , avoid excessive stimulation , keep baby lie back , stretch limb close body , perform kinesthetic stimulation one limb time . Researchers team regular meeting mother include IG every 48 hour assure intervention instruct check parental bond PARENTAL BONDING INSTRUMENT ( PBI ) apply professional blind group child belong . Follow appointment , home visit intervention follow program The systematic orientation program early intervention accord developmental milestone , anticipate month evolutionary step acquisition motor / cognitive expect corrected age . In first half correct age , mother , father / correspond caregiver receive simple guideline encourage large motor skill , fine cognition . The time activity must exceed 15 minute must seem game.Three time / week ( alternate gross fine motor stimulation ) . We perform two orientation every three month cognitive stimulation , fine gross motor , total 10 home visit promote guidance supervision session . Systematic orientation deliver parent medical appointment follow clinic . There home visit order evaluate comprehension orientation sure intervention do family . There multidisciplinary team involve whole study critical view intervention impact ( final evaluation ) ; conventional intervention group . The infant evaluate relation motor , cognitive neurodevelopment use AIMS Bayley III scale 12 18 month correct age . AIMS ( Alberta Motor Infant Scale ) : blind physiotherapist evaluate child group 12 18 month Alberta Infant Motor ( AIMS ) scale eligible patient . A global evaluation perform one year chronological age Bayley AIMS scale . The evaluation conduct presence parent caregiver safe surface room child move around evaluation . The examiner interact child encourage response , physical facilitation movement avoid . During evaluation , punctuate behavior less mature within motor repertoire child position ( supine , prone , sit stand ) . This repertoire call `` motor '' window . All item price within window motor window motor previous item score . The evaluation end , child receive score base sum item score posture , call raw score . This score observe standardized chart find baby development percentile accord chronological age correct . Percentiles instrument standard : 5 % , 10 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % . According percentile baby 's development classify three category : normal typical ( percentile &gt; 25 % ) , suspicious ( BSDI-III : Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development third edition : The Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development , Third Edition , use assessment neurodevelopment 12 18 month ' correct age . The scale administer hospital clinic , day follow-up visit , psychologist blind group allocation . Cognitive , motor , language development consider normal high 89 ; average 80 89 ; borderline 70 79 ; extremely low less equal 69 . Examine facets young child 's development accord manual . AIMS Bayley Scales recommend use together different age false positive common therefore beneficial follow-up child high risk motor impairment one time point , use combination assessment tool . If program show good result expand whole preterm population order improve neurodevelopment outcome .</detailed_description>
