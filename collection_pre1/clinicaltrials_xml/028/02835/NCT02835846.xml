	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome characterized symptom complex urinary urgency , usually associate frequency nocturia , without urgency urinary incontinence absence infection pathology . OAB affect approximately 31 % woman age 65 . Vaginal estrogen , well-documented treatment OAB hypoestrogenic woman , show improve symptom frequency , urgency urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) . Several theory propose explain mechanism underlie estrogen 's effect lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . The investigator propose estrogen treatment influence bacterial community ( microbiomes ) vagina bladder alters urothelial vaginal ( AMPs ) thereby improve OAB symptom hypoestrogenic woman . Long-standing medical dogma replace clear evidence female urinary microbiome ( FUM ) exist . The investigator recently report FUM woman without OAB le diverse FUM woman OAB . The investigator soon report FUM status stratifies woman OAB treatment response group woman less diverse FUMs likely respond anti-cholinergic OAB therapy ( Thomas-White et al. , preparation ) . This suggest FUM factor lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) FUM diversity contribute LUTS treatment response , like vaginal microbiome contribution vaginal symptom . In hypoestrogenic woman , vaginal microbiome shift low diversity community , commonly dominate Lactobacillus , diverse community dominate anaerobes ; change reverse estrogen treatment . Since FUM woman OAB include bacteria similar vaginal microbiome ( e.g . Lactobacillus , Gardnerella , diverse anaerobe ) , investigator reason FUM would respond similarly estrogen become less diverse . Although transvaginal medication likely alter nearby bacterial niche ( e.g . bladder ) , study report urinary microbiomic response vaginal estrogen . While almost nothing known urinary/vaginal microbiome interplay , even less know immune response modulation bladder vagina . However , estrogen reduces subsequent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) rate hypoestrogenic woman affect recurrent UTI , estrogen induces urothelial antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) expression . Since AMPs exhibit microbicidal activity , stimulate inflammation , facilitate epithelial barrier homeostasis , estrogen may work AMPs mediator optimize microbial equilibrium . The investigator hypothesize , follow estrogen treatment hypoestrogenic woman OAB , symptom improvement associate 1 ) reduce FUM diversity , 2 ) alteration FUM characteristic 3 ) increase AMP level . The investigator propose two specific aim : Aim 1 : To compare pelvic floor microbiome ( PFM ) diversity AMP level estrogen treatment hypoestrogenic woman OAB symptom . Aim 2 : Determine FUM characteristic correlate OAB symptom .</detailed_description>
