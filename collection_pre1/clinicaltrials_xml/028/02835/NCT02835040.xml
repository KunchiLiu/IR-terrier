	<detailed_description>Each year community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) cause 61,000 hospital admission ( 2006-7 data ) incurs cost AUD300 million Australia . At investigator ' institution , 1000 admission per year average hospital length stay ( LOS ) 5 day incur average clinical cost AUD6,724 per admission ( 2012/13 data ) . Prolonged LOS significant implication organizational cost also strongly associate adverse patient outcome include loss function due de-conditioning high incidence hospital-acquired adverse event include hospital-acquired infection , intravascular-device associated complication antibiotic-related side effect . Reducing LOS therefore benefit patient health system . General Internal Medical ( GIM ) service manage large proportion CAP patient Western Health , 47 % CAP admission manage GIM 2012/13 ( average age 75 proportion least 1 , 2 3 active co-morbidities 70 % , 43 % 27 % respectively ) . With population ageing , elderly highly multi-morbid population treat GIM unit constitute bulk Australia 's future health service burden CAP . A number intervention improve clinical outcome CAP support recently accrue level 1 evidence . Following Cochrane review 2011 suggest adjunct corticosteroid accelerate time clinical stability , number trial since demonstrate favorable outcome . Most notable two landmark large randomize control trial ( RCT ) ; study effect corticosteroid reduce treatment failure severe CAP publish JAMA , study publish Lancet 2015 demonstrate faster clinical recovery shorter LOS ( 1 day ) without significant adverse events.10 A subsequent meta-analysis ( 2000 patient 12 RCTs ) confirm finding routine adjunctive corticosteroid widely support though yet consistently deploy . Early mobilization safely effectively reduce LOS apply appropriately early switch oral antibiotic guide set well-defined basic clinical laboratory criterion . Recently , RCT incorporate measure demonstrate LOS reduction 2 day compare standard care . A meta-analysis nutritional support malnourish medical inpatient ( patient cohort include admitted CAP ) show systematic screening risk malnutrition target nutritional therapy intervention reduce non-elective readmission rate . No exist study assess bundle four establish intervention ( corticosteroid , early switch oral antibiotic , early mobilization systematic screening malnutrition target nutritional therapy ) . However , adherence consensus guideline CAP notoriously poor suggest major challenge bridge `` evidence-practice gap '' particularly change clinician behavior . Generalist clinicians become increasingly overwhelmed plethora guideline multiple illness may co-exist patient . Currently Western Health , 43 % CAP patient receive corticosteroid , 63 % physiotherapy ( median time initiation 2 day ) 65 % guideline-compliant antibiotic . No parenteral antibiotic stopping rule place ( median 3 day ) . There current compliance rate 72 % malnutrition risk screen inpatient across health service . The investigator believe therefore , order address gap evidence practice , alternative service model necessary ensure best practice specifically lead contributor health service burden . The investigator propose evaluate stand-alone over-arching `` syndrome-based '' clinical service CAP analogous already apply area ( e.g . `` stroke-services '' credit substantial improvement outcomes acute cerebrovascular disease ) . The propose `` CAP Service '' would core responsibility ensure comprehensive rigorous current evidence-based best practice application standardize set management algorithm incorporate intervention support Level 1 evidence . Service evaluation take form step wedge study design , type cluster RCT particularly well-suited implementation health service research . Importantly , investigator already successfully implement design health service research Western Health . The primary research question quantify impact dedicated CAP Service deliver consistent standardize evidence-based care length stay , cost , 30- 90-day readmission rate mortality .</detailed_description>
