	<brief_title>Red Blood Cell Transfusion Ambulatory Setting : Impact Home Functional Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion frequently employ ambulatory hospital environment aim improve patient functional status . The efficacy 10.5 billion dollar per year practice however increasingly call question . The Investigators propose directly measure impact outpatient RBC transfusion at-home functional status record several physiological parameter quantifiable physical activity metric , e.g . daily energy expenditure daily total step count , use ActiGraph wGT3X-BT . This device accelerometer-based wearable similar size small watch worn waist . Study participant wear device course daily activity give investigator quantifiable insight activity level home environment . Methods/Design : This randomize crossover pilot clinical trial participant study duration 28 day . The crossover nature allow patient serve his/her control . Details study design provide text . Briefly , patient present Mayo Clinic Scottsdale 's Ambulatory Infusion Center ( AIC ) randomize one two arm : 1 ) receive RBC transfusion schedule ( transfuse ) , 2 ) abstain schedule transfusion ( no-transfuse ) . After appropriate washout period , patient cross transfuse arm no-transfuse arm vice-versa . Activity level record continuously throughout study need intervention patient . In addition device data , survey data collect via weekly telephone interview . The primary outcome measure include technical performance metric daily energy expenditure well practical performance metric change step count . A variety secondary outcome measure include daily sedentary time PROMIS Global 10 score . Discussion : This trial directly assess impact red blood cell transfusion patient functional status location important - home . Patient recruitment begin August 2016 due complete August 2017 .</detailed_description>
