	<detailed_description>The investigator seek approval Mayo Clinic Arizona State University Institutional Review Board recruit 30 type 1 diabetes adult outpatient use insulin pump continuous glucose monitoring system Endocrinology Clinic Mayo Clinic Arizona . First , participant complete questionnaire self-assess confidence count carbs food/drinks , personal perception exercise/alcohol affect blood glucose , learn ( e.g. , trial error , education provider ) , compensation technique use adjust exercise performed/alcohol consume ( instance , adjust basal rate adjust insulin bolus ) . Stored glucose data analyze previous 8 week prior entry establish patient-specific upper low bound determine excessive blood glucose high low . Second , participant randomly assign 4 week use pump bolus wizard decide insulin bolus 4 week use iDECIDE receive recommendation insulin dose , vice versa . Throughout 8 week , study participant ask wear wristband heart rate accelerometer provide data time duration exercise perform . Also , 8 week , study participant use glucose sensor pump measure blood glucose deliver basal insulin . During 4 week participant receive recommendation iDECIDE , pump 's bolus calculator turn participant receive insulin bolus recommendation pump . While receive recommendation iDECIDE , participant use pump manually deliver insulin bolus either use advice iDECIDE override . The primary outcome compare iDECIDE 's insulin dose algorithm pump calculator : mean postprandial glucose level number event excessive blood glucose high low . Potential secondary outcome : mean percentage time low glucose level time spend target glucose range .</detailed_description>
