	<brief_summary>Angiogenesis , development new blood vessel , play important role disease development tumor growth many solid organ malignancy . Bevacizumab first anti-angiogenic drug approve solid tumor show advantageous activity multiple tumor type . However , response Bevacizumab often transient due tumor 's manipulative ability circumvent usual pathway find salvage pathway instead . Nintedanib demonstrate anti-tumor activity non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , renal cell cancer . The combination Bevacizumab Nintedanib propose target tumor 's manipulation process generate alternate pathway angiogenesis thus create potential benefit delay tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nintedanib Plus Bevacizumab Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , phase I dose-escalation study Nintedanib combine standard-dose Bevacizumab advance solid tumor Bevacizumab indication . The primary endpoint safety tolerability drug combination determination recommend Phase II dose Nintedanib combination standard dose Bevacizumab . The first three patient treat Nintedanib daily plus Bevacizumab day one three week cycle . If dose limit toxicity , three additional patient treat drug Nintedanib slightly high level . Finally , third cohort three patient dose even high level . Once maximum tolerate dose Nintedanib reach , additional six patient treat dose combination Bevacizumab disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
