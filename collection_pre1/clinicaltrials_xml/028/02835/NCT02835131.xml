	<detailed_description>Congenital hyperinsulinism rare condition cause life-threatening hypoglycemia . Current treatment congenital hyperinsulinism often suboptimal , diazoxide mainstay treatment . Individuals adequately treat diazoxide may undergo pancreatectomy . Octreotide use success congenital hyperinsulinism limit data pasireotide , new somatostatin receptor agonist , , compare octreotide , 30-40 time great affinity somatostatin receptor 1 ( SSTR1 ) 5 ( SSTR5 ) , 5 time great somatostatin receptor 3 ( SSTR3 ) comparable affinity somatostatin receptor 2 ( SSTR2 ) . In human islet , SSTR2 &amp; SSTR5 present beta cell . Therefore , reason believe pasireotide may great effectiveness octreotide prevent hypoglycemia due hyperinsulinism . Indeed hyperglycemia know effect pasireotide use treatment Cushing 's disease Acromegaly . The current study compassionate use prevention hypoglycemia individual congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia adequately treat diazoxide .</detailed_description>
