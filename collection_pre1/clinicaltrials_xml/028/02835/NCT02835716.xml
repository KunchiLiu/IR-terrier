	<brief_summary>This Observational protocol attempt verify two recent critical concept ALZ Clinical Research study high-risk individual already take medication may prevent onset ALZ . - It may possible determine future development ALZ preclinical state cognitively normal high risk individual least 18-24 month symptom develop cognitive impairment . - Early treatment cognitively normal high-risk person subclinical pre-ALZ prevent delay occurrence severity ALZ . Caveats Neither protocol fMRI image design intend diagnose treat ALZ , develop use medication diagnostic neuroimaging outside already approve accepted parameter . Persons volunteer study subject observational protocol care primary care / specialty physician , order test treatment see appropriate . Although large body peer-reviewed scientific literature demonstrate certain functional MRI pattern associate certain neurologic condition , utilization fMRI evaluation neurologic disorder still consider emerge science therefore investigational stage . Although protocol report brain pattern certain neurologic condition cognitive impairment Alzheimer 's disease , base pattern publish peer-reviewed journal , finding consider stand alone diagnostic per se always consider PMD conjunction patient 's clinical condition . These data use additional information add PMD 's diagnostic impression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective observational study participant age 50-75 year identify currently ( &lt; 1 month ) take soon ( within 3 month ) start take study medication interest thru physician . Prospective observational study participant explain person cognitively normal high risk develop clinical ALZ , risk prospectively identify . They advise rationale medication soon take may protective effect delay onset ALZ , protective effect monitor . They ask would like participate protocol monitor prospective risk develop ALZ short term , whether certain prescribed medication may protective effect . Those accept participant enrol study . Enrollees test risk factor pre-clinical ALZ . Individuals identify risk baseline follow 6 month interval 24 month period use psychometric test functional neuroimaging . Their maintenance cognitive stability cognitive decline monitor care PMD take medication interest .</detailed_description>
