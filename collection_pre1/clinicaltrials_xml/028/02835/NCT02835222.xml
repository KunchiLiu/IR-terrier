	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well selinexor work give together induction , consolidation , maintenance therapy treat old patient acute myeloid leukemia . Selinexor may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Selinexor induction , consolidation , maintenance therapy may kill cancer cell old patient acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor With Induction , Consolidation , Maintenance Therapy Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility add selinexor induction , consolidation maintenance therapy elderly acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety administer selinexor propose study regimen . II . To assess response survival endpoint patient receive propose study regimen . III . To assess rate allogeneic stem cell transplantation . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) day 1-7 , daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 , selinexor orally ( PO ) twice weekly day 1 . Treatment continue 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients whose disease respond receive cytarabine IV day 1-5 , daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-2 , selinexor PO twice weekly . Treatment continue 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients remission receive cytarabine IV every 12 hour day 1 , 3 6 , selinexor PO twice weekly day 1 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients response go transplant receive selinexor PO twice weekly . Treatment continue 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
