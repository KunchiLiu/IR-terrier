	<brief_title>Study Fecal Bacteria Early Diagnosis Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut microbiota closely related human gut neoplasm . According recent statistic , abundance FN ( Fusobacterium Nucleatum ) connect development progression CRCs ( colorectal cancer ) . Subsequent research show identify multiple microbial-specific gene human feces use qPCR ( quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ) may help diagnosis early stage colorectal cancer . Currently little know relationship single abundance specific gut microbiota colorectal cancer different stage . Moreover , find early-stage CRCs still great challenge partially due precancerous disease like colorectal adenoma remain difficult differentiate early-stage CRC endoscope . Conventional clinic method predict CRCs largely depend serum CEA ( serum Carcino Embryonic Antigen ) OB ( fecal occult blood test ) , lack adequate sensitivity specificity especially early stage CRCs . The investigator ' work focus abundance gut microbiota feces people colon neoplasm comparison classical indicator CEA OB , aim reveal testify potential role assist diagnosis CRCs different stage none-invasive cost-effective method .</detailed_description>
