	<detailed_description>Introduction In Czech Republic , 120 -150 thousand people live dementia . The common form dementia Alzheimer 's disease , constitute 50 -70 % dementia case prevalence population rise increase proportion population 60 year age . In 2012 , patient dementia Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , treat disease first time , comprise 28 % total number outpatient treat dementia . Number treat patient dementia increase 5 % year 2012 2013 . According World Health Organisation , dementia become priority health care system . Maintaining improve quality life ( QoL ) amongst elderly dementia currently one key aim health care . Foreign literature point fact QoL amongst elderly dementia ( EwD ) yet sufficiently examine , particularly long-term perspective . This may stem fact QoL amongst EwD examine relation relatively limited group factor . We see attempt define factor affect quality life amongst EwD . Among factor direct impact assessment QoL amongst EwD attitude age . Social interpersonal factor also play important role subjective perception QoL . This include decreased ability communicate deepen social isolation early-phase dementia , reflect negatively subjectively perceive QoL amongst EwD . QoL amongst elderly slight cognitive impairment dementia significantly affect fear fall . Other factor include dignity , chronic pain depression . Another major factor connect age frailty , impairs ability organism react stressor affect QoL . For reason relation frailness cognitive impairment study today . One factor affect QoL amongst EwD also functional condition . The EwD need increase amount supervision help activity daily living ( ADL ) dependence negatively affect QoL . The relation comorbidity QoL amongst EwD clearly prove early study . However , important aspect comorbidity relation QoL health status elderly . An early-phase dementia primarily characterise memory impairment relatively maintain self-sufficiency require minor attention help family caregiver . Older adult usually aware condition may cause depression , anxiety insecurity . Self-assessment QoL amongst people early-phase dementia support late research abroad . Cross-sectional study mainly long-term observation QoL trajectory important individual dementia . When investigate trajectory QoL amongst EwD , necessary examine factor might affect QoL . So far , longitudinal study focus change QoL connection progress dementia contribute factor . This may due fact QoL amongst EwD examine relation relatively limited group factor , even though previous research recommend examine change QoL amongst EwD long run large group respondent . Project Objectives In order maintain maximum possible quality life people suffer disease nervous system , early diagnosis therapy necessary , well nurse psychosocial care . The aim improve quality life lower frequency length hospitalisation , also enhance individual 's resilience . The chance express quality life subjectively shifts assessment health care result solely medical perspective assessment perspective concrete individual . The objective project monitor trajectory subjectively perceive quality life amongst elderly early-phase dementia long run . Identifying factor effect quality life may help enhance resilience elderly positive effect physical , psychosocial social dimension quality life early-phase dementia home care thus low frequency length hospitalisation well cost health care social care . The main aim project ascertain quality life change amongst Czech elderly early-phase dementia ( quality life trajectory ) . To achieve main aim , five sub-aims set , support investigation quality life patient nervous system disease , namely amongst elderly early phase dementia . 1 . Translation validation Czech version standardise QOL-AD PDI questionnaire . 2 . Identification important factor contribute change quality life among Czech elderly early-phase dementia . 3 . Creation profile quality life trajectory amongst Czech elderly early phase dementia . 4 . Comparison trajectory Czech elderly early-phase dementia trajectory elderly diagnose dementia . 5 . Creation database subsequent longitudinal trajectory track quality life old people dementia Methodology In order achieve goal project , prospective , longitudinal design use quantitative method use - survey research carry group respondent enter study repeat twice subsequently 12-month interval . Prior 1st stage survey research , translation validation QOL-AD PDI questionnaires do . Based result international study , group factor identify affect quality life elderly dementia . The research carry use batch standardise Czech version questionnaire related factor : Quality Life - Alzheimer 's Disease ( QOL-AD ) ; Geriatric Depression Scale Yesavage ( GDS-15 ) - Czech version ; Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE - Czech version ) . In case use MMSE bound licence fee Czech version Addenbrook Cognitive Examination ( ACE-CZ ) use ; Patient Dignity Inventory ( PDI ) ; Attitude Aging Questionnaire ( AAQ ) - Czech version ; Falls Efficacy Scale International ( FES-I ) - Czech version ; Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) - Frail Index ; Bristol Activities Daily Living Scale ( BADLS-CZ ) , Horizontal visual analog scale ( HVAS ) . Furthermore , comorbidity index basic demographic data ( age , sex , socio-economic status , education ) gather evaluate . Research sample consist two group old adult . The first ( patient ) group : elderly diagnose dementia early phase ( F00 , F01-F03 ) address together family caregiver via neurologic outpatient office , elderly treat diagnosis . The second ( control ) group : elderly without dementia , address GP 's surgery . The respondent gather Olomouc , Moravia-Silesia Hradec Králové Regions . Sample size : 580 respondent ( 290 old adult dementia 290 old adult without dementia ) .</detailed_description>
