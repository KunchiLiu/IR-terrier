	<brief_summary>The study use prospective design consist three phase . The phase : 1. development sensory retrain treatment ( SRT ) , 2. evaluation treatment 's feasibility acceptability , 3. assessment efficacy . During third phase , pilot study conduct participant randomly assign either SRT waitlist control group order ass efficacy . Diagnostic information eligibility criterion assess use Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) Clinician Administered PTSD Scale DSM-5 ( CAPS-5 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perceptual Retraining Reduce Suicide Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use clinical interview , self-report measure , behavioral assessment evaluate efficacy SRT protocol . The study recruit approximately 30 veteran . The primary inclusionary criterion participant must show evidence olfactory perceptual bias toward military-relevant stimulus ( e.g. , burn rubber , decay , fuel ) . Investigators require current suicidal ideation entry criterion investigator believe fair percentage veteran suicidal ideation/intent make entry requirement limit investigator ability recruit give tight timeline study . The study consist development evaluation novel intervention . The essential feature intervention use gradient trigger smell ( e.g. , burn rubber , decay , fuel , etc . ) , participant systematically expose effort facilitate habituation odor . The SRT protocol administer two 1-hour session . Participants return 1 month final SRT protocol session complete battery follow-up measure , well CAPS-5 . The primary outcome measure interest : olfactory perceptual bias ( measured olfactory bias assessment ) , suicidal ideation behavior ( measure Beck Suicide Scale Depressive Symptom Inventory- Suicidality Subscale ) , symptom related suicide , anxiety trauma ( measure Beck Anxiety Inventory PTSD Checklist DSM-5 , respectively ) .</detailed_description>
