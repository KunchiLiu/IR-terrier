	<brief_summary>The investigator ' research aim develop effective , finite approach manage individual patient chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) . This prospective clinical basic scientific study exclusively focus patient early antigen negative form disease , developed country treat indefinitely antiviral drug . The investigator ' study `` BeNEG-DO , '' directly offer patient already take standard oral Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) antiviral therapy least 192 week option stop continue treatment . Drawing data pilot study , include investigator ' University California , San Francisco Sutter Institutional Review Board-approved study , investigator examine finite HBV treatment strategy clinical outcome safety . In conjunction , investigator study immunologic mechanism gene expression profile correlate predict post-treatment clinical course . The BeNEG-DO study could seriously question , potentially change , current treatment paradigm million patient CHB also lead new disease-terminating antiviral therapeutic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective case-control study safety clinical outcome , innate adaptive immune response genetic predictor , adult human subject HBeAg-CHB either continue stop nucleoside nucleotide analog ( NA ) antiviral therapy . Immune response study use liver tissue serial peripheral blood sample . The immunological factor select chosen base preliminary inferential evidence . Immunologic finding correlate different serologic , virologic biochemical outcome . Genetic predictor type response respective clinical outcome also seek .</detailed_description>
