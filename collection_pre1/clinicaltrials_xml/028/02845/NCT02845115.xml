	<brief_summary>The age population , great exposure noise , responsible increase incidence hearing loss ( presbycusis ) . This hearing loss sensorineural disability become real public health problem . The main mean rehabilitation disability represent apparatus patient conventional hearing aid . However , hear aid several drawback limit profit , often abandon prosthesis patient . Middle ear implant develop answer problem . They intend amplify sound signal transmit directly middle ear compensate hearing loss indicate case failure contraindication conventional equipment . However , middle ear implant currently limitation performance failure . Recent data show performance ossicle repair technique dependent couple ossicular prosthesis ossicle . Furthermore , advance understand biomechanics ossicle confirm importance placement linkage surgical restoration process . This data apply middle ear implant improve performance . Indeed , preliminary experimental study anatomical part , use analysis vibration middle ear structure laser velocimetry , allow u define transducer placement method couple method ossicle . We wish validate vivo result pilot study small number patient compare two surgical technique guide velocimetric measure .</brief_summary>
