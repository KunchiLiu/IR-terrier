	<brief_title>Study Laparoscopic Spleen-Preserving No . 10 Lymph Node Dissection Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical resection still primary method treat advance gastric cancer.According Japanese treatment guideline gastric cancer , D2 lymphadenectomy , include No . 10 lymph node dissection , adopt upper third gastric carcinoma.The incidence No . 10 lymph node metastasis high advance proximal gastric cancer , report range 9.8 % -20.9 % , presence No . 10 lymph node metastasis closely related survival . Therefore , East Asia , D2 lymph node dissection potentially curable locally advanced upper third gastric cancer include No . 10 lymph node standard surgical treatment . In early , splenectomy perform remove No . 10 lymph node . With improvement medical knowledge surgical technique , spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection recognize surgeon . However , due special complex anatomy spleen , spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection difficult , even open surgery ; consequently , surgery perform many center . Laparoscopic surgery distinct minimally invasive advantage , small incision , less blood loss , less postoperative pain , mild postoperative inflammatory reaction , quick recovery gastrointestinal function , short hospital stay obvious cosmetic effect . Since Kitano et al . first report laparoscopic gastrectomy gastric cancer 1994 , laparoscopic technique develop rapidly . The technique become increasingly mature , make possible perform laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection . Our center first propose `` Huang 's three-step maneuver '' , new operative method suitable laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection . This method simplify procedure laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection facilitate popularization promotion . However , remain controversial international issue safe feasible routinely conduct laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection advance upper third gastric cancer.A number retrospective study successively confirm safety , feasibility oncological efficacy laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection.But multicenter prospective study identify result . Therefore , The study prospective , multicenter , open , single-arm , non-inferiority study , explore safety feasibility laparoscopic spleen-preserving No . 10 lymph node dissection patient locally advanced upper third gastric adenocarcinoma（cT2-4a , N-/+ , M0） .</detailed_description>
