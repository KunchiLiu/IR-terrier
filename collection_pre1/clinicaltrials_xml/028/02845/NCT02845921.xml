	<detailed_description>Propofol intravenous anaesthetic agent use induction maintenance anaesthesia . It widely employ due quick onset action , short half life rapid recovery . An important adverse effect significant fall blood pressure . Although exact mechanism propofol induced hypotension know , venodilation , decrease peripheral resistance decrease cardiac output suggested.2 Though hypotension transient , produce devastate effect . Hence need prevent . Moreover , several attempt treat propofol induce hypotension meet variable limited success . Hypotension follow spinal anaesthesia also frequent problem . It generally treat intravenous fluid vasopressor . Simple non pharmacological measure like leg elevation leg wrap Esmarch bandage report successful.3 These reduce incidence severity hypotension associate spinal anaesthesia improve venous return . The mechanisms hypotension follow intravenous propofol spinal anaesthesia almost similar . Therefore , investigator hypothesize leg elevation wrap attempt reduce propofol induced hypotension . They simple cost effective technique reduce need pharmacological measure control hypotension . As literature search reveal information regard usefulness technique propofol induced hypotension , current clinical study do determine efficacy leg elevation wrap reduce incidence severity propofol induced hypotension patient undergo general anaesthesia . The current study compare efficacy leg elevation leg wrap reduce incidence severity propofol induced hypotension term incidence hypotension , magnitude decrease systolic , diastolic mean arterial blood pressure , need pharmacological measure treat hypotension , change heart rate adverse clinical outcome , . It prospective randomise control open label study January 2016 August 2017 involve 150 adult patient undergo general anaesthesia . For statistical analysis , descriptive statistic - minimum , maximum , mean standard deviation use . Independent sample test data follow normal distribution data follow normal distribution , Mann-Whitney U test use . P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . To study relationship hypotension variable , Pearson 's correlation use . Confidence interval calculate 95 % .</detailed_description>
