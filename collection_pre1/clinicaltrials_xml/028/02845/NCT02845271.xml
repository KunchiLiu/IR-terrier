	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess efficacy single intraarticular dose GZ389988 compare placebo relief knee pain patient osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee . Secondary Objectives : To assess safety tolerability single intraarticular dose GZ389988 patient painful OA knee . To assess pharmacokinetic parameter single intraarticular dose GZ389988 patient painful OA knee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof-of-concept Study Assess Efficacy , Tolerability Safety Single Intraarticular Dose GZ389988 Versus Placebo Patients With Painful Osteoarthritis Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening perform within 21 day dose . Following single dose study medication , study period patient 84 ± 7 day end-of-study visit . Total duration one patient 16 week ( end-of-study visit ) , include long-term observational safety follow-up phone call 12 additional week . The collection primary endpoint data Week 4 futility analysis optional . Assuming possible step-down dose due safety/tolerability reason , total expect maximum number include patient could increase maximum 182 patient .</detailed_description>
