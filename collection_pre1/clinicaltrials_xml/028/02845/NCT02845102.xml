	<brief_title>Treating Comorbid Depression During Care Transitions Using Relational Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression treatable disorder effective pharmacologic psychotherapy option treatment . Evidence suggest psychotherapy intervention cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) self-management education ( Lorig ) improve depression , physical symptom quality life patient chronic medical conditions.While depression treatable , less 36 % patient afflict mood disorder get treatment . In order meet imminent need post-discharge mental health support patient chronic illness , innovative approach deliver mental healthcare accessible short notice , urgently need . The study investigator aim translate RED-D intervention automate system expand immediate access scalability support service . Cognitive behavioral therapy depression ( CBT ) self-management education study treatment comorbid depression chronically ill patient . CBT psychosocial intervention posit depressive symptom occur individual dysfunctional view , world future . CBT teach technique examine dysfunctional belief perpetuate depression develop accurate helpful one alleviate condition . It largely document CBT among effective treatment depression show effective psychosocial treatment , effective pharmacotherapy effective add another medication patient respond one antidepressant alone . CBT also successfully use treat comorbid depression ; ENRICHD trial demonstrate collaborative care approach , hinge CBT , effective treatment depressive symptom among post MI patient superior usual care . Several study also demonstrate efficacy self-management education . For example , Lorig et al show self-management education enhance self-efficacy reduces health service utilization among patient chronic illness . This similar program include key process identify address problem , problem solve skill training , action plan design , apply skill medical psychosocial aspect chronic illness . However , self-management education alone show limited efficacy chronically ill patient significant depression . A intervention combine CBT depression self-management support . Culley et al show brief CBT intervention integrate self-management strategy reduce depressive dyspnea symptom trial veteran diagnose either CHF COPD primary care set . This evidence suggest blend brief skills-based approach treatment address physical symptom depression effective depressed patient chronically illness . However , conventional CBT limitation . Traditionally , CBT deliver face-to-face format require patient meet therapist office set weekly session 1 week . Adherence barrier CBT due factor related stigma , transportation , access train CBT clinician . This led trial alternative format deliver CBT include telephone deliver CBT computer-based CBT ( cCBT ) , show increase adherence treatment compare face-to-face CBT . Many cCBT model use today numerous technological advantage include cost effectiveness , increase access flexibility , also reduce stigma seek treatment mental health condition . cCBT also show effective people age 50 , suggest cCBT feasible old patient . However , still several limitation cCBT impact efficacy . For example , current cCBT system largely rely textbased interaction , create potential literacy barrier user . Similar face-to-face CBT , nonadherence also problem cCBT . Sustained adherence essential reach successful therapeutic outcome cCBT . Yet , despite promise , evidence show outside clinical trial condition , many cCBT user complete intervention , thus adherence still problem , although cCBT system embed adherence support message weekly reminder demonstrate high rate program completion . The study investigator propose automate delivery AHRQ 's RED-D intervention extend integrate self-management education patient CHF COPD comorbid depression follow hospitalization . This intervention deliver use Relational Agent ( RA ) technology . Relational agent animate counselor provide patient virtual consultation simulate face-to-face conversation empathic provider . RAs provide ideal medium CBT intervention : 1 ) demonstrate ability address non-adherence ; 2 ) empathic communication feature ; 3 ) ability tailor intervention individual patient ; 4 ) study investigator ' past work demonstrate hospitalized patient depressive symptom report high acceptance RA ; 5 ) potential address mental healthcare access barrier . Similar effort use RA technology explore US Department Defense address burden PTSD among war veteran . Traditional CBT effective medically ill patient limited impact physical symptom experience therefore quality life healthcare utilization . Cully et al show brief , face-to-face CBT intervention integrate self-management education effective medically ill patient primary care reduce depression symptom improve quality life . The relational agent CBT ( RA-CBT ) system include six module tailor chronically ill patient comorbid depression , include key component face-to-face CBT . The final session include follow exit interview understand patinet participant 's experience RA-CBT program evaluate effectiveness RA-CBT agent . The final session incorporate quantitative questionnaire voluntary qualitative interview . The RA-CBT program include follow topic : cognitive restructuring ( identify behavior , emotion , thought associate chronic disease depression , evaluate identify helpful one ) , problem solving , behavioral activation , adherence medical appointment medication management , disease self-management . The disease self-management module address relaxation , sleep hygiene physical symptom management . Each module contain homework component . The RA-CBT protocol empathic , reflective interactive , enhance possibility develop engagement , increase adherence , establish trust relationship therapeutic alliance . Whereas current cCBT user ask question , study team 's RA-CBT intervention make use psychosocial technology allow RA interact respond question arise . Drs . Bickmore , Jack Mitchell conduct series study use RA technology health education behavior change , include inpatient education ( AHRQ grant 1R18HS017196-01 AHRQ RFTO `` Communication- Focused Technologies '' ) counsel patient level health literacy . Dr. Bickmore team Northeastern University extensive experience design implement RA psychosocial technology simulate face-to-face conversation sensitive quality CBT help establish empathetic relationship , hone use social interaction conversational technology order build trust therapeutic alliance agent patient . There many reason RAs provide effective medium health communication patient , especially limited health literacy . The human-computer interface relies minimally text ( compare current cCBT model ) use universally understood format face-to-face conversation , make accessible patient limited read ability . Most importantly , RAs enhance recall critical information use nonverbal conversational behavior ( gesture , tone ) provide redundant channel convey semantic content order enhance likelihood message comprehension . In addition , culture nonverbal mean mark emphasis ( example , eyebrow raise 'beat ' 'baton ' hand gesture American English ) may highlight salient part message . Unlike pre-recorded video lecture , study team 's RA-CBT intervention provide flexible dynamic communication medium rely synthetic speech tailor patient discourse context use language dynamically assemble use dialogue engine ( i.e . use patient 's name , medical record information , personally relevant information ) respond context conversation ( i.e . question ask , patient response earlier session , etc . ) Patient contribution dialogue make select want say multiple choice menu , dynamically updated turn conversation ( natural language understanding unconstrained text speech perform ) . Alternative technology offer adaptive , face-to-face encounter accommodate patient ' need . This interface use 2,500 patient include many prior computer experience .</detailed_description>
