	<brief_title>The Effect Intraoperative Goal Directed Restricted Fluid Therapy Extravascular Lung Water</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid management important impact patient outcome . Under-resuscitation lead hypoperfusion over-resuscitation lead tissue oedema . Intraoperative goal direct fluid therapy ( GDT ) report improve patient outcome high risk surgical patient . GDT aim optimize oxygen delivery various strategy . The main three GDT strategy : 1 . Stroke volume optimization fluid 2 . Stroke volume variation ( SVV ) pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) optimization fluid . 3 . Oxygen delivery index fluid inotropes Although GDT recommend professional society Europe United Kingdom , recommendation recently challenge many randomize controlled trial meta-analysis.The effect GDT intraoperative fluid requirement previously report , however ; effect extravascular lung water well study . Electrical cardiometry recent non-invasive technology cardiac output measurement . Electrical cardiometry drive CO measurement thoracic electrical bioimpedance . Good correlation report CO measurement derive electrical cardiometry continuous thermodilution monitoring system . Although many protocol GDT report major abdominal operation , till consensus optimum protocol optimum goal achieve fluid management . Major abdominal operation characterize major fluid shift . Moreover , patient undergo operation prone impair organ function due tissue oedema . Traditional standard care major abdominal operation usually include 6 ml/Kg/h balance crystalloids ( restore insensible loss maintenance requirement ) addition replacement blood loss . We hypothesize use restrict fluid approach ( 2ml/Kg/h ) + GDT guide cardiometry improve fluid management decrease extra-vascular lung water . The aim study compare use Goal Directed fluid therapy guide Stroke volume variation plus restricted fluid management approach standard fluid management patient undergo major abdominal operation .</detailed_description>
