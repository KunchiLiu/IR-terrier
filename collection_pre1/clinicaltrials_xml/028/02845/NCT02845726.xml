	<brief_title>Biofilms Short-term Indwelling Ureteral Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform provide well understanding influence biofilms ureteral stent entire spectrum stent-associated morbidity . Moreover , could provide detailed knowledge correlation occurrence biofilms ureteral stent finding urinary analysis , could serve decision support whether patient ureteral stent undergoing intervention ( example ESWL simple secondary URS ) receive antibiotic prophylaxis . Correlation result urinary bacteriology ( assess pre- intraoperatively ) biofilm analysis stent could provide information `` targeted antibiotic treatment '' base urinary bacteriology possible . Correlation urinary analysis conventional urinary bacteriology could provide valuable contribution regard prediction bacteriuria necessity postpone operation . Additionally , study intend provide overview recent bacterial specie involve biofilms ureteral stent resistance antibiotic . This could provide valuable information choice antibiotic case treatment perform empirically .</detailed_description>
