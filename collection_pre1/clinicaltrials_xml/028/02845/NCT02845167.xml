	<brief_summary>Basic animal research demonstrate exercise training protect myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury several biological mechanism . This effect exercise training may beneficial perioperative period cardiac complication may arise . However , exercise induce cardioprotection lose completely within 18 day stop train program . This find animal research use test hypothesis 3 day consecutive exercise last bout conduct within last 24/48 hour prior surgery , cardioprotective effect . Specifically , exercise show protect cardiac myocytes reperfusion induce oxidative stress mitochondrion reperfusion induce damage . This exercise mediate cardioprotection observe short moderate duration ischemia ( i.e . 5-20 min ) moderate severe ( i.e.20-60 min ) ischemic insult . The effect exercise induce cardioprotection investigate cell level show whether translate reduction postsurgical reperfusion injury associate complication . To study potential cardioprotective effect investigator aim recruit patient high risk receive reperfusion injury surgery . Specifically , investigator recruit abdominal aortic aneurysm patient risk heart complication high . There also currently evidence publish literature regard effect preoperative supervise exercise .</brief_summary>
