	<detailed_description>The carotid body , locate bifurcation common carotid artery , play crucial life-saving role control breathe human . The carotid body contain type 1 cell primarily sensitive low oxygen concentration arterial blood . In response low oxygen carotid body send information brainstem respiratory center brisk hyperventilatory response initiate ensure increase uptake oxygen via lung . Following surgery , rapid return carotid body function vital persistent loss carotid body function may result respiratory complication occur independent effect anesthetic ( incl . muscle relaxant ) respiratory muscle . Respiratory complication related loss carotid body function include inability respond properly hypoxia well inability overcome upper airway obstruction . The latter especially important patient sleep disordered-breathing obese patient . These patient rely optimal function carotid body response hypoxia upper airway closure . Important neurotransmitter involve carotid body response hypoxia include acetylcholine , act local nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor . Apart observation muscle relaxant ( blocker acetylcholine receptor ) affect proper functioning carotid body , investigator knowledge dynamic effect muscle relaxant carotid body function time relationship carotid body function Train-of-Four ( TOF ) ratio time . Additionally , data link use NMB antagonists return carotid body function . Linking TOF ratio carotid body function clinical importance possible relationship allow clinician predict carotid body function TOF ratio . The latter highly relevant investigator show previous trial large proportion patient extubated TOF ratio 's &lt; 0.7 . Apart carotid body , chemoreceptor brainstem exist sensitive hypercapnia . This response system control cholinergic neurotransmission . Since investigator may assume hypercapnic ventilatory response influence muscle relaxant investigator use response calibrate hypoxic ventilatory response responses equally affected effect muscle relaxant muscle function . As state data effect muscle relaxant carotid body function one fix TOF ratio ( TOF ratio fix 0.7 ) . No data available : 1 . Dynamic effect carotid body function measure hypoxic ventilatory response TOF ratio 's slowly change 0.6 1.0 ; 2 . Dynamic effect reversal NMB sugammadex versus neostigmine . Sugammadex neostigmine reversal agent neuromuscular blockade . At institution investigator use agent clinical practice remain without knowledge effect carotid body function . The current proposal design study item 1 2 healthy awake volunteer .</detailed_description>
