	<brief_summary>Blood transfusion requirement represent one significant cost driver associate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . In addition increase prevalence co morbidity old patient , AML old patient often associate adverse feature young adult . Physicians might therefore decide offer palliative supportive care rather intensive chemotherapy . An alternative treatment could low-intensity therapy , LD-AraC hypomethylating agent , demonstrate good result Best Supportive care ( BSC ) . Blood transfusion requirement represent one significant cost driver associate AML . The present study assess cost-effectiveness intensive chemotherapy versus Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) versus alternative therapy ( hypomethylating agent , low-dose cytosine arabinoside ( LD-AraC ) , investigational drug ) elderly patient age 70 year old regard blood product transfusion French payer perspective . Intensive chemotherapy BSC comparators analysis , since continue represent commonly use treatment elderly AML accord defined status patient consider 'fit ' 'unfit ' intensive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
