	<brief_summary>Comminuted intra-articular distal tibia fracture ( OTA 43-C ) typically result high-energy trauma motor vehicle collision fall height . They complex injury often associate significant fragment displacement severe soft tissue injury , combination long challenge orthopedic surgeon . Traditionally , surgeon use plain film ( X-ray ) CT scan ( 2 3 dimensional ) determine fracture pattern displacement . Yet , case , still difficult identify relationship among bone fragment , often make articular restoration challenge . As result , patient non-anatomic joint reconstruction higher rate poor outcome . The primary objective study compare patient outcomes two group , one group receive enhance pre-operative planning ( 3D print plastic prototype + standard care [ SOC ] image 3D CT scan + plain film radiograph ) second group receive pre-operative planning use SOC image alone ( 3D CT scan + plain film radiograph ) . Patient outcomes collect throughout 12 month post-operative period include assessment radiographic fracture healing ( union , non-union , malunion ) , pain use Numeric Pain Rating Scale , Olerud Molander Score base patient 's self-report , development complication ( infection , wound healing , re-operation , re-hospitalizations ) . The secondary objective study evaluate whether utilize enhance pre-operative plan 3D print plastic prototype alter original pre-operative plan base SOC image alone ( 3D CT scan + plain film radiograph ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Recruitment Patients comminute distal tibia fracture ( OTA 43-C type ) present care Inova Fairfax Medical Campus ( IFMC ) Inova Medical Group ( IMG ) Orthopaedic outpatient clinic eligible consent possible enrollment study . Patients compensate participate study . Given convenience sample patient present acute traumatic injury , plan advertise recruit patient . 2 . Subject Randomization Blinding Procedures Eligible patient randomize equal proportion one two group ( enhance pre-operative planning vs. SOC pre-operative planning ) use electronic randomization system simple randomization table . After consent inclusion/exclusion criterion confirm , subject randomize research coordinator/associate . All surgeon temporarily blind randomization assignment , order complete unbiased pre-operative plan ( pre-randomization survey ) use SOC image alone ( plain film radiograph 3D CT scan ) . After pre-operative plan ( pre-randomization survey ) complete attend surgeon ( use SOC image alone ) submit research coordinator/ associate , surgeon inform randomization assignment . For subject randomize enhance pre-operative planning group , surgeon provide 3D prototype ask complete post-randomization survey capture pre-operative plan . The biomechanics lab arrange research coordinator/associate delivery 3D prototype , ensure temporary blinding treatment assignment broken . A post-randomization survey administer surgeon subject randomize SOC group . Subjects blind assign group . However , order ensure temporary blind maintain attend surgeon perform definitive surgery , subject wo n't inform randomization assignment time definitive surgery . 3 . Standard Care Procedures Prior Definitive Surgery : All Groups The following pre-operative care describe standard practice general summary care give study patient prior definitive surgery , regardless treatment group assignment . There two scenario patient eligible approached participation study : 1 ) . stable fracture treat splint , 2 ) . unstable ( open close ) fracture require external-fixator surgery . All patient initially evaluate emergency department ( ED ) member orthopaedic trauma team . Patients axially stable injury undergo manual realignment application well-padded posterior U-shaped plaster splint . A computed tomography ( CT ) scan sagittal , coronal reconstruction 3D reformation obtain ED ; send home learning crutch ambulate , instruction continue strict elevation , non-weight bearing , follow-up clinic . Once patient see clinic , determine surgery require patient subsequently schedule definitive surgery , occur resolution swell normalization skin . Patients present ED axially unstable-closed fracture initial plain radiograph undergo close reduction admit hospital surgical placement temporizing , span external-fixator ( Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester , PA ) . Patients axially unstable-open fracture administer intravenous antibiotic tetanus update presentation ED , go operate room urgent initial debridement placement temporizing , span external-fixator . Patients unstable fracture ( open close ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan sagittal , coronal reconstruction 3D reformation placement external-fixator . Patients discharge appropriate placement ( home vs. acute rehab vs. SNF ) evaluation physical therapy definitive surgery schedule . All patient non-weight bearing study injury limb . Definitive operative fixation occur resolution swell normalization skin . 4 . Study Procedures : Pre-operative Surgery Planning open treatment internal fixation ( ORIF ) Surgery 4.1 Standard Care In control group , 20 patient standard care treatment , include pre-operative evaluation surgical planning base plain film ( 3 view : anterior , lateral oblique ) CT scan sagittal , coronal 3D reformation . Operative fixation fracture use distal tibia fracture fixation implant ( Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester , PA ) perform standard approach judge operating surgeon . The implant include , limited : 3.5 mm LCP Low Bend Medial Distal Tibia Plates , 3.5 mm LCP Antero-lateral Distal Tibia Plates , 3.5 mm LCP Posterior Distal Tibia Plates , 2.7 mm / 3.5 mm LCP Distal Fibula Plates . 4.2 Treatment Group : Enhanced Pre-Operative Planning In treatment group , 20 patient randomize enhanced pre-operative planning include 3D prototype distal tibia , fibula talus—in addition standard care image ( plain film 3 view , CT scan sagittal , coronal 3D reformation ) . On injured extremity , discrete bone fragment segment model study injury import computer aid design ( CAD ) software Unigraphics NX8 ( Siemens PLM , Plano , TX ) . CAD model injure ankle convert plastic prototype use Ultimaker 3D printer ( Ultimaker B.V. , Geldermalsen , Netherlands ) . Surgeons use 3D plastic prototype model understand geometry , displacement , ideal reduce location fragment . Based addition 3D plastic prototype model , second pre-operative plan document . This compare initial pre-op plan determine addition 3D prototype change surgeon 's plan . The 3D plastic prototype may bring operating room ( unsterile field ) reference surgery surgeon execute surgical plan . ORIF conduct fix fracture per surgeon 's standard practice . The implant include , limited : 3.5 mm LCP Low Bend Medial Distal Tibia Plates , 3.5 mm LCP Antero-lateral Distal Tibia Plates , 3.5 mm LCP Posterior Distal Tibia Plates , 2.7 mm / 3.5 mm LCP Distal Fibula Plates ( Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester , PA ) . 5 . Baseline Follow-Up Assessments Demographics , mechanism injury , fracture classification collect baseline . Patients follow 12-month period 6 week , 26 week , 52 week postoperatively . The outcome parameter collect follow-up visit include re-operation , malunion nonunion , complication , Olerud Molander Score , Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) pain , General Health Status . Radiographs part standard care obtain anterior , lateral oblique plane ( 3 view ) ass heal . The Schedule Events detail requirement procedure visit . Paper Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) use document follow-up assessment ( source documentation ) enter electronically ( eCRF ) electronic data capture system . In case patient able come person follow-up assessment effort bring patient appointment exhaust , option complete follow-up via telephone interview may complete . 5.1 Outcome Surveys Three outcome survey obtain follow-up visit : 1 ) Olerud Molander Scoring Symptoms Ankle Fracture , 2 ) Numeric Pain Rating Scale , 3 ) General Health .

The Olerud Molander Scoring Symptoms Ankle Fracture 9-question self-assessment pain , stiffness , swell , ability climb stair , run , jump , squat , use support , work/activities daily life . A total score 100 calculate , 100 equal best completely unimpaired . The Olerud Molander Scoring Symptoms Ankle Fracture support valid instrument , significantly correlate linear analog scale use subjectively assess ankle function , range motion load dorsal extension , presence osteoarthritis presence dislocation radiograph . The Olerud Molander Score also capture minor subjective difference disability high correlation test-retest reliability . A Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) ( 11-point numeric scale ) , numeric version Visual Analog Scale pain , use ass subject 's current pain level . The NPRS 10 cm horizontal line , separate 1cm integer increment , anchor 0 = No Pain 10 = Worst Possible Pain . The Numeric Rating Scale demonstrate valid term construct validity , compare 5 pain intensity measure Visual Analog Scale Verbal Rating Scales . Subjects give rating scale , self-administered , record number best reflect current pain . The NPRS take less 1 minute complete . The NPRS also administer verbally telephone . The subject 's general health state measure use Centers Disease Control Prevention 's Health-Related Quality Life , Healthy Days Core Module Question 1 . This general health question part 4 item Healthy Days Core Module , find several national survey , include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Medicare Health Outcome Survey . The validity CDC 's HRQOL demonstrate . 6 . Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis conduct use SPSS ( IBM , version 18.0 ) statistical significance set p &lt; α= .05 ( two-tailed ) .
