	<brief_summary>The study aim systematically investigate interaction training modality , ACE genotype disease heart patient complete cardiovascular rehabilitation program . This carried goal improve benefit cardiovascular rehabilitation patient maximise adjustment muscle structure function intervention . A population healthy individual recruit carry training program , order compare training effect respective general population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pharmacological inhibition angiotensin convert enzyme modifies exercise-induced pro-angiogenic mitochondrial gene transcript expression . Exercise-induced muscle plasticity importantly interact insertion/deletion genotype ACE training modality intensity . The aim study systematically investigate interaction training modality , ACE genotype disease heart patient complete cardiovascular rehabilitation program . There two training modality use : The first modality involve cardiovascular training interval type protocol include high repetition number shortening ( i.e . concentric ) type contraction softrobotic device . The second modality include high repetition number lengthening ( i.e . eccentric ) type contraction softrobotic device . In train modality muscle group exercise range motion , speed movement , widely differ pedal force . Total absolute external mechanical work match . In order ass baseline value effect size muscle training adjustment make , healthy male female volunteer include matched respect age sex patient population undergo training program .</detailed_description>
