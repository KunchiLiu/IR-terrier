	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major public health problem annual incidence 1.7 million per year . TBI associate various long-term morbidity . Among , psychiatric disturbance major cause chronic disability poor quality life . Major depression common psychiatric sequela post TBI rate range 13 % 1 year 60 % 8 year TBI . Major depression TBI ( henceforth refer TBI depression ) often associate comorbid neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) anxiety , aggression , substance abuse cognitive deficit often make treatment difficult . Despite increased rate depression , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug/s treatment . The investigator propose address limitation use novel serotonergic agent , vortioxetine , multimodal mechanism action serotonin transporter ( SERT ) inhibition , 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) 3 , 7 , 1D receptor antagonism , 1B receptor partial agonism , 1A receptor agonism . Overarching Goal : The overarch goal propose pilot study determine effectiveness safety vortioxetine treatment post-TBI depression co-morbid NPS . Study Design : The study design include DBPCT 30 TBI patient severities meet DSM 5 criterion major depression . A total 150 consent allow screen failure . Written inform consent obtain patient . Subjects follow total 12 week . Subjects randomize either vortioxetine arm ( N=15 ) placebo arm ( N=15 ) . The treatment group receive vortioxetine 10mg per day , increase 20 mg decrease 5 mg , deem clinically necessary , week 4 8 . Subjects total 4-5 visit : Baseline evaluation ( 1 2 visit ) follow-up visit week 4 , 8 12 . Well-validated psychiatric instrument use compare effectiveness vortioxetine versus placebo treatment week 12 compare baseline Relevance : This study potential provide strong preliminary evidence use vortioxetine safe novel agent treatment TBI depression psychiatric co-morbidities . If find effective , result study used design large study also determine brain change associate use via neuroimaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study investigator propose recruit 30 outpatient TBI vary degree severity also meet DSM 5 criterion major depression . The investigator screen many potential subject possible get total 30 participant meet study criterion complete study ( Total 30 study completers ) . Written inform consent obtain participant prior collection data . Participants evaluate use well validate psychiatric instrument Participants recruit several source : ( 1 ) Brain Injury Clinic Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center ; ( 2 ) referral Hopkins outpatient clinic ; ( 3 ) Brain injury support group organize Brain Injury Association Maryland , ( 4 ) Advertisements place local newspaper ( 5 ) Trial Facts - online recruiting source . The study sit Geriatric &amp; Neuropsychiatry clinic Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . Overarching Goal : The overarch goal propose pilot study determine effectiveness safety vortioxetine treatment post-TBI depression co-morbid neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) . Study Design : The study design include Double Blinded Placebo Controlled Trial ( DBPCT ) 30 TBI patient severities meet DSM 5 criterion major depression . A total 150 consent allow screen failure . Written inform consent obtain patient . Subjects follow total 12 week . Subjects randomize either vortioxetine arm ( N=15 ) placebo arm ( N=15 ) . The treatment group receive vortioxetine 10mg per day , increase 20 mg decrease 5 mg , deem clinically necessary , week 4 8 . Subjects total 4-5 visit : Baseline evaluation ( 1 2 visit ) follow-up visit week 4 , 8 12 . Well-validated psychiatric instrument use compare effectiveness vortioxetine versus placebo treatment week 12 compare baseline treatment major depression neuropsychiatric co-morbidities . Relevance : This study potential provide strong preliminary evidence use vortioxetine safe novel agent treatment TBI depression psychiatric co-morbidities . If find effective , result study used design large study also determine brain change associate use via neuroimaging . Depression common neurological disorder stroke , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , dementia syndrome . Results study shed light management depression neurological disorder .</detailed_description>
