	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Nivolumab With Without Urelumab Patients With Cisplatin-Ineligible Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial design randomize patient cisplatin-ineligible MIBC ( stag T2-T4 , N0-1 , M0 ) one two treatment arm : Arm A - Nivolumab combination Urelumab Arm B - Nivolumab monotherapy . The study population include male female patient age 18 muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder ( MIBC ) suitable cisplatin-based chemotherapy , fit undergo surgical resection cancer cystectomy . Patients resectable clinical node positive disease within true pelvis ( N1 ) eligible .</detailed_description>
