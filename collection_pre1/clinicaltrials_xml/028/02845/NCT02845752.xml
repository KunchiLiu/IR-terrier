	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether exercise prolong COPD inhaled bronchodilator Stiolto Respimat . The study identify whether endurance benefit due reduction fatigue originates within skeletal muscle and/or effect neural activation skeletal muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect STIOLTO™ RESPIMAT® Fatigue Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) reduce exercise tolerance . One mechanism think due dynamic hyperinflation exercise ( increase end-expiratory lung volume ) contribute sensation breathlessness . Whether also contribute inhibit motor recruitment , reduce available power output ( termed performance fatigue ; PF ) , well understood . Preliminary data suggests many COPD patient , unlike healthy subject , stop exercise 'skeletal muscle power reserve ' i.e . ability acutely increase muscle power output . This suggest limited exercise task mechanism acute intramuscular limitation power production ( termed muscle fatigue ; MF ) . Exercise tolerance increase treatment fixed-dose combination bronchodilator , STIOLTO™ RESPIMAT® . We hypothesize increased exercise tolerance STIOLTO™ RESPIMAT® ( reduce performance fatigue ; PF ) mediate combination : 1 ) reduce inhibition muscle activation ( termed activation fatigue ; AF ) allow patient drive leg muscle hard , thus ; 2 ) increase muscle fatigue ( MF ) .</detailed_description>
