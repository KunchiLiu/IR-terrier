	<brief_summary>The study open label cohort study 2 two-treatment group 2 ) . Both group treat single oral administration Diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) 6 mg/kg + Albendazole ( ALB ) 400 mg + Ivermectin ( IVR ) 200 µg/kg ( IDA ) . One treatment group include men woman W. bancrofti infection ( &gt; 50 Mf/ml , N=30 ) . The treatment group include men woman free W. bancrofti infection base negative blood test microfilariae ( Mf ) circulate filarial antigen ( N=30 ) . Active follow-up adverse event ( AE ) 72hrs passive follow-up 7 day follow treatment . Participants follow 1 year evaluate treatment efficacy . Individuals severe AEs ( grade 3 high ) transport Agboville District Hospital care hospital staff . Based treatment 100 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) infect individual AEs develop within first 72 hour follow treatment uncommonly 7 day post-treatment . All individual admit single health center hospital Côte d'Ivoire . Subjects monitor 72-hours treatment safety facilitate sample drug analysis safety test . Participants undergo clinical monitoring every 6 hour evaluate potential adverse effect Ivermectin + Diethylcarbamazine + Albendazole ( IDA ) treatment . Participants also monitor hematologic , biochemical abnormality period observation .</brief_summary>
