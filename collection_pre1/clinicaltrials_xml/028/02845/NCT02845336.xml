	<brief_summary>Thyroid eye disease ( TED ) autoimmune disorder immune system attack orbital tissue , result characteristic change eyelid position , globe position orbit , extraocular muscle balance , optic nerve function . TED potentially blind disease , current treatment largely consist nonspecific reduction inflammation use corticosteroid radiation therapy . Regardless treatment , TED progress inflammatory phase fibrotic , resolution phase , orbital change become fix modified surgery . The investigator propose treat cohort patient active TED use selective COX-2 inhibitor , celecoxib , compare patient observational control group . The investigator hypothesize celecoxib reduce severity disease and/or prevent progression proptosis , diplopia , corneal exposure compressive optic neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Thyroid Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator intend use celecoxib , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment pain , osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , treatment active TED . In vitro data show transformation orbital fibroblast adipocytes mediate cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , case report suggest COX-2 inhibition improve TED acute phase . Thus , investigator intend evaluate efficacy COX-2 inhibition treatment active TED ability improve acute inflammatory sign permanent fibrotic change quiescent disease . The investigator enroll patient active TED treat 3 month ( characteristic period disease activity ) compare standard treatment mild active TED ( observation , counter intervention lubrication artificial tear ) ass efficacy .</detailed_description>
