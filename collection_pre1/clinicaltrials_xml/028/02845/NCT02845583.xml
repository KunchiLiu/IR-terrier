	<detailed_description>Study design The methodological approach use achieve objective research quantitative . A mixed study design adopt : 1 . Retrospective study determine nature volume activity provide nursing class patient whose admission attribute specific DRG 2 . Longitudinal prospective study determine variability cost nurse regard DRG refund , comparatively distribution patient every single section ( high , medium , low complexity ) . Study population The sample choose consider prevalence hospitalization per year medical oncology U.O.C . relate certain DRG characterize great complexity care , provide useful information base study . For retrospective study survey conduct sample 150 patient . Patients enrol high , medium low complexity care , hospitalize chemotherapy biliary obstructive urinary tract first half 2016 . It estimate sample represent 30 % total number admission make 2016 . A prospective longitudinal study take consideration sample 150 patient characteristic consider enrollment retrospective study . The study include patient go : CHT duration hospital stay 2-3 day ( microcitomi NHL ) , CHT length hospital stay 4-5 day ( sarcoma ) , CHT length hospital stay &gt; 5 day high dos ( testicle cancer , Ewing 's sarcoma bone sarcoma ) patient high complexity care . Patients 18 year age less exclude , well patient transfer unit inpatient , patient transfer U.O.C . Oncology major surgery procedures department , admission outlier . The duration monitoring phase allocation distribution patient among different section hospital care intensity ( Intensità di cure , IC ) care complexity ( Complessità Assistenziale , CA ) , base result obtain Triage corridor ( TriCO ) , estimate 3 month maximum six month start March 2016 . For collection data relate amount type activity provide first half 2016 estimate maximum 30 day others 30 day detection relative DRG reimburse hospitalization consider . Survey instrument - Professional Assessment Instrument ( PAI ) . It tool document nurse process implement computerized way use nursing language accord North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International ( NANDA-I ) . - Hospital discharge card ( Scheda di dimissione ospedaliera , SDO ) . It tool contains information patient discharge , necessary attribution DRG find rate payable episode hospitalization - Scheda di mobilità interna dei pazienti . It card contain data Tri-CO entrance patient variation index hospitalization . Interventions The study present manager coordinator U.O.C . Medical Oncology moment training/information . In order collect data variation Tri-CO hospitalization , consequently different allocation U.O.C . Oncology patient section low , medium high complexity care , point contact ( nurse ) identify deal collection retention information manner set research protocol . Outcome measure The primary outcome expect survey quantification volume nursing activity provide patient cost . In addition , expect realize economic indicator make possible ascertain : - Cost weight nursing staff DRG rate reimburse relation complexity care patient ; - Cost weight nursing staff reimbursement hospitalization connection DRG patient discharge . - Gap theoretical actual cost nurse relation care deliver specific patient ; Knowledge actual cost distinct specific episode hospitalization would enhance `` uniqueness '' . An economic analysis labor nursing cost individual patient could provide input determination cost professional Foundation , contribute improvement corporate strategic management resource allocation . Statistical analysis Statistical analyse perform use method descriptive statistic inferential statistic appropriate sample size study variable . Prospective longitudinal study use determine frequency distribution variance stay patient individual section hospital in-patient treatment attribute specific DRG . Then factorial analysis regression technique use measure type bond exist dependent variable Y ( nurse ) independent variable X1 , X2 , X3 ... ( DRG , age , day hospitalization , complication , etc ) . Then analysis continue study variable affect distribution patient IC CA level change assignment single in-patient episode , create variability cost service pay .</detailed_description>
