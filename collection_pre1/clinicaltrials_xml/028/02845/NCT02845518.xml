	<detailed_description>EValuation cardiac magnetic resonance Imaging ( cMRI ) follow assessmenT patient pulmonary Arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Prospective cohort study cMRI PAH . Biomedical research 18 center : CHRU de Nancy , APHP Bicetre hospital , CHRU de Bordeaux , CHRU de Brest , CHRU de Caen , CHRU de Dijon , CHRU de Grenoble , CHRU de Lille , CHRU de Lyon , CHRU de Marseille , CHRU de Montpellier , CHRU de Nice , CHRU de Poitiers , CHRU de Rennes , CHRU de Rouen , CHRU de Strasbourg , CHRU de Toulouse , CHRU de Tours . Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) characterize progressive increase pulmonary vascular resistance lead right ventricular ( RV ) failure eventually death . The therapeutic strategy become complex need perform recur follow evaluation include right heart catheterization ( RHC ) . Although , RHC perform experience center low mortality low morbidity , repeat invasive pulmonary hemodynamic measurement burdensome still present risk complication . Once diagnosis PAH establish , follow evaluation devote modify specific therapy rely mainly RV function parameter . Thus , echocardiography cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cMRI ) meet many criterion ideal monitoring tool . Echocardiography safe , inexpensive widely available . However , test several limitation . Firstly , due complexity right ventricle chamber , measurement RV volumes difficult . Secondly , criterion numerous quantitative measurement different threshold apply without accepted definition . Thirdly , operator dependency could make difficult obtain reproducible image . Cardiac MRI advantage accurately assess RV volume important prognostic predictor cardiac index , stroke volume ( SV ) right ventricular ejection fraction ( RVEF ) . It demonstrate inter-observer intra-observer variability cMRI right ventricle measure PAH patient low . In addition , MRI-derived cardiac index , SV RVEF significantly improve month PAH specific therapy prognostic value regardless change pulmonary vascular resistance trial small size . In preliminary study perform CHRU-Nancy investigator find significant correlation cardiac output measure cMRI RHC ( 0.85 , p &lt; 0.001 ) 21 PAH subject . The agreement 2 method correct accord Bland-Altman plot . The purpose present study investigate strategy assess PAH severity . The investigator propose replace currently recommend method , RHC , cMRI . The investigator intend use validate measurement RV volume cardiac output cMRI order demonstrate cMRI accurately evaluate severity disease follow strategy . The objective project show non-invasive pulmonary hemodynamic evaluation disease severity use cMRI effective RHC , reliable safe . The originality study compare multicenter study cMRI-derived variable currently recommend measurement require RHC . The main objective ass hemodynamic diagnosis performance ( sensibility specificity ) baseline follow visit cMRI detect unfavorable hemodynamic status comparison result RHC . Diagnostic trial : cardiac MRI compare RHC ( current guideline ) . The secondary objective 1 ) 5 ) : - 1 . To assess predictive value first occurrence morbi-mortality event 2 different analysis derive , firstly RHC criterion ( cardiac index ( CI ) &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² right atrial pressure &gt; 8 mm Hg ) secondly cMRI criterion ( CI &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² RVEF &lt; 35 % absolute decrease 10 % RVEF follow-up evaluation ) . - 2 . To assess univariable association first morbi-mortality event occurrence New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class , 6-minute walk distance , plasma level B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) /N-terminal ( NT ) -proBNP , continuous hemodynamic variable cMRI , RHC echocardiography data collect baseline 4-6 month follow-up . - 3 . To assess multivariable association first morbi-mortality event occurrence factor , identify clinical hemodynamic variable independently contribute prognosis . Using result analysis investigator plan build multiparameter prognostic score . - 4 . To quantify complication due cMRI RHC . - 5 . To compare acceptability tolerability cMRI RHC patient . Primary endpoint : Sensitivity specificity cMRI diagnosis unfavorable status define current RHC criterion ( 95 % confidence interval ) . Unfavorable hemodynamic status RHC cardiac index &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² right atrial pressure &gt; 8 mm Hg ( currently accept criterion ) versus MRI CI &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² RVEF &lt; 35 % absolute decrease 10 % RVEF follow-up evaluation . Secondary endpoint : In relation secondary objective 1 ) 3 ) : Morbi-mortality event define one first follow event , adjudicate independent committee : ) death cause , b ) lung transplantation , c ) atrial septostomy , ) worsen PAH define three follow criterion : decrease 6-minute walk distance least 15 % baseline , worsen PAH symptom unscheduled hospitalization due PAH , e ) unsatisfactory status non-hemodynamic parameter follow visit : clinical evidence right ventricular failure unresponsive oral diuretic therapy , NYHA functional class IV worsen functional class II III 6-minute walk distance &lt; 300 ( absence cause PAH ) , elevate rise BNP/NT-proBNP . Adjudication morbi-mortality endpoint perform blinded pulmonary hemodynamic follow-up data . In relation secondary endpoint 4 ) 5 ) secondary objective : All adverse event collect , physical psychological distress due cMRI RHC assess questionnaire use Likert scale . The patient complete questionnaire minute undergo cMRI RHC . Prospective cohort study PAH patient recruit 18 center French network severe pulmonary hypertension . A routine search condition know cause pulmonary hypertension perform accord current guideline . Therefore patient undergo baseline echocardiography , RHC current routine test . This screening period . Then patient select sign write informed consent . Subsequently , context study , cMRI perform . According current guideline end baseline visit PAH-specific drug therapy initiate associated treatment already progress incident case prevalent case , respectively . The inclusion phase last 24 month . A comprehensive severity evaluation perform 4-6 month , 24 month follow-up case clinical worsening . According current guideline , assessment include NYHA functional class , 6-minute walk distance , plasma level BNP/NT-proBNP RHC . As part ancillary study , 30 ml venous blood collect RHC . An echocardiography perform discretion investigator . According purpose present study , visit cMRI also perform . All clinical procedure except cMRI standard care . Morbi-mortality collect prospectively last patient complete 24-month follow visit . RHC do accord currently recommend . MRI data interpretation : MRI protocol post-processing guideline send prior site initiation order apply method cMRI center . This avoid important measurement error . RV contour indexed aortic flow measurement perform locally dedicate software use clinical practice physician center . Cardiac index RVEF derive measure . All cMRI image send store CHRU Nancy . MRI interpretation perform blindly respect clinical RHC data . All adverse event collect follow . The questionnaire assess physical psychological distress present minute RHC cMRI . 180 subject enrol study : size give study 90 % power find significant 5 % -level sensitivity specificity : - 90 % low 95 % confidence limit 75 % , - 60 % low 95 % confidence limit 40 % . General consideration : Analysis primary secondary endpoint perform intention-to-treat confirmatory analyse per-protocol population . The 2-tailed significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . Complications cMRI RHC ( secondary objective 4 ) The frequency adverse event report follow-up compare group use Chi-Square test ( Fisher 's exact test request ) . Relative tolerability cMRI RHC ( secondary objective 5 ) The investigator use Kruskal-Wallis test determine overall physical psychological distress score different across two group . If primary endpoint reach , positive result could allow broadly extending finding . Therefore , possible decrease number RHC , invasive cumbersome procedure without alter prognosis . Positive result also improve level evidence severity assessment PAH patient . According secondary objective investigator expect good predict morbi-mortality event cMRI compare RHC . Thus composite score construct include cMRI parameter internally validate . Such score easily externally validate widely use . A biological repository carry include DNA , plasma serum baseline plasma serum follow evaluation . The investigator apply grant fund biobank .</detailed_description>
