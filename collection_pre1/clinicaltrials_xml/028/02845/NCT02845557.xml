	<brief_summary>Early onset type 2 diabetes mellitus among adolescents/youth ( YT2DM ) rise phenomenon . The pathophysiology study primarily non-Asian population literature incretin effect scarce . The investigator evaluate insulin sensitivity , beta-cell function , incretin hormone effect YT2DM multiethnic Malaysian population . The characterization population may enable u good tailor antidiabetic care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The prevalence Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) youth increase . Until 10 year ago USA , T2DM account less 3 % case new onset diabetes adolescent . More recent data suggest 45 % case attribute . - The prevalence Diabetes Mellitus Malaysia rise 11.6 % 15.2 % last 5 year accord National Health Morbidity Survey 2011 . Among population age 20-24 year old , prevalence diabetes rise also 2.0 % 4.9 % . Of great concern still 90 % young diabetes previously undiagnosed , thus raise possibility predominantly T2DM . The report Malaysian DiCare registry ( 2006-2007 ) show T2DM account 17.6 % diabetes adolescent . In recent audit diabetes clinic Penang General Hospital 2012 , 56.7 % patient age 20 clinical T2DM ( data yet unpublished ) . The marked difference proportion young T2DM audit may contribute possible under-reporting first audit raise possibility also rise incidence young T2DM Malaysia . - This rise prevalence T2DM youth significant public health challenge . Studies young adult suggest development progression clinical complication might especially rapid onset T2DM early . This , couple long lifetime exposure diabetes , raise possibility serious public health challenge next decade . Detailed understanding pathophysiology complication burden among population therefore crucial development appropriate management plan . - Studies youth onset T2DM suggest drive combination insulin resistance beta cell dysfunction , hyperglycemia develop beta cell fail compensate appropriately peripheral insulin resistance state . However , study predominantly do among western population mainly Black Hispanic ethnic group . There reason believe pathophysiology may different different population . The ability beta cell secrete sufficient insulin adequately respond peripheral insulin resistance state influence genetic environmental factor . Degree insulin resistance appear vary among different population study . There currently paucity literature regard pathophysiology underpinning T2DM among Malaysian youth . - The knowledge incretin effect severely reduce patient adult onset T2DM use good pharmacotherapeutic effect patient . However , incretin effect less well study among T2DM youth understand area helpful guiding use incretin hormone treatment youth onset T2DM .</detailed_description>
