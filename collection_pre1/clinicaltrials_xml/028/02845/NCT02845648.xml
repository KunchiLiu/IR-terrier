	<brief_title>Ability Awaken Nonmonosymptomatic Enuresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturnal enuresis associate three main etiology , include nocturnal polyuria secondary abnormal anti-diuretic hormone level , low bladder capacity relate low urinary tract dysfunction , sleep disorder cause problem arousal . Among , association enuresis low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) gain importance . If two condition coexist , diagnosis nonmonosymptomatic enuresis ( NME ) . The reported prevalence LUTS among enuretic patient range widely 21 % 99 % . Moreover , report spontaneous resolution prolong , case NME likely become refractory treat like monosymptomatic enuresis ( ME ) case . A possible explanation may presence bladder dysfunction address properly standard treatment ME . However , explanation speculative . By show paradoxical increase light sleep high cortical arousal index enuretic child reduce bladder capacity , one reason impaired ability awaken ( AA ) enuretic patient may lie chronic stimulation bladder . This kind bladder dysfunction lead abnormal bladder-brain dialogue elaborate experiment show brain dysfunction ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter result experimental reduction bladder capacity . If true enuretic child , may able improve arousal ( improved AA ) increase bladder capacity . Based hypothesis , present study aim evaluate effect anticholinergic therapy standard urotherapy improvement AA show effect improve AA treatment response child NME .</detailed_description>
