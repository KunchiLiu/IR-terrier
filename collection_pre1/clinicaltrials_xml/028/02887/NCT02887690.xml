	<brief_summary>The purpose study optimize Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 's ( DARPA ) advance upper limb prosthesis , Modular Prosthetic Limb ( MPL ) , evaluate performance , usability , patient acceptance MPL clinical setting . This study non-randomized limited clinical optimization study . The study consist two phase . Up twenty-four upper extremity amputee recruit order ensure twelve subject participation study : 6 trans-humeral amputee 6 trans-radial amputee . During Phase 1 , subject evaluate potential operate MPL use virtual limb control signal surface electromyogram ( sEMG ) . The first six trans-humeral amputee subject first six trans-radial amputee subject demonstrate proficiency control MPL base analytical performance metric enter Phase 2 . During Phase 2 , subject fit prosthesis custom socket . The user evaluate prosthesis twelve 1- hour 1 one half-hour session , work occupational therapist research associate complete quantitative qualitative assessment .</brief_summary>

Medically clear use prosthetic device base residual limb condition overall health , include participant without prior prosthetic experience . Exclusion Criteria Age less 18 great 65 . Presence mild severe traumatic brain injury permanent temporary impairment cognitive , physical , psychosocial function associate diminish altered state consciousness indicate neuropsychological screening currently perform routinely patient TBI program WRNMMCB note subject 's medical record . Current , know uncontrolled systemic disease . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . Subjects lack effort determine research team . Subjects screen effort use Test Malingering Memory ( TOMM ) , score low 42/50 serve exclusionary . Significant Axis I II diagnosis determine neurologist psychiatrist 6 month prior entry study . Use pacemaker , minimize risk surface electromyography interference . Lack health insurance .</criteria>
