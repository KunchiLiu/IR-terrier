	<brief_summary>For esophageal cancer patient , chest CT could provide accurate stag information eliminate operation could achieve R0 resection T4 disease . However , variation image quality usual encounter contrast medium inject via peripheral vein . Power injectable port could provide secure vascular access administration route contrast medium via central vein . This could provide high intravascular contrast medium concentration could lead good image quality . This study divide two arm , one group plan receive power injectable port another receive conventional port . The aim study try identify image difference different contrast medium administration route survival impact esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It extremely important cancer patient reliable vascular access may use administer irritant infusion , chemotherapeutic agent intravenous nutrition supplement , draw blood routine examination long term . To address patient ' need , Aubaniac introduce central vein puncture technique vascular infusion 1952AD . With technique , patient allow take intravenous infusion safely experience repeat puncture every 5-7 day prevent tunnel tract infection . Later , improvement medical material , first indwell intravenous catheter design BrovIac could implant period time . In 1979 , base prototype , Hickmen add subcutaneous cuff order separate proximal part catheter environment minimize risk tunnel tract infusion , lead cosmetic concern compromise patient ' daily activity . It 's till 1982 Dr. Niederhuber develop totally implantable venous device , make vascular access set simpler patient . However , low injection pressure set constrain application , power injection contrast medium CT scan . Therefore , peripheral venous puncture still inevitable sometimes patient intravenous access device place . Patients cancer need regularly receive image surveillance evaluate treatment efficacy . Besides , surveillance image provide benchmark reference adjustment treatment plan . To provide enhanced quality image , contrast medium expect administer certain injection rate . Such requested injection rate would generate high pressure due sticky nature contrast medium . Most time , pressure incur far beyond pressure set conventional port mostly range 10 ~ 12 atmospheric pressure ( approximately 145 ~ 175 psi ) may cause device rupture burst . Venipuncture still unavoidable oncologic patient intravenous port implant administer contrast medium patient ' vessel completely protect repeated venipuncture . Besides , patient ' native vessel infusion pressure limitation . Extravasation contrast medium peripheral soft tissue would happen patient poor vessel need power injection contrast medium . Extravasation contrast medium may lead cutaneous necrosis different degree . Such consequence cause pain patient , also postpone subsequent treatment continue wound heal . The delay treatment might impact patient ' survival . To avoid complication , radiologist force low infusion velocity contrast medium compromise quality image request diagnosis . Tumor would induce neovascularization process may trigger abnormal new vessel form surround lesion provide request nutritional support growth . Given characteristic , contrast-enhanced image play important role evaluate degree tumor invasion . In addition , information regard relative anatomic relationship tumor surround vital structure also crucial formulation treatment plan . However , medical image color black white image , image sharp contrast present subtle change tumor clearly reference evaluation physician . If resectability metastatic lesion could identify medical image early possible , personalized treatment could plan achieve good survival rate . Therefore , extremely important acquire clear medical image . With respect conventional CT , indicate relative anatomical relationship tumor surround vital structure , key basis formulation treatment plan . Current initial imaging data show CT image take infusion implant port endure high infusion pressure actually different take infusion peripheral vein Theoretically , contrast medium administrate via central vein could increase concentration contrast medium within short time , improve image quality tissue close tumor greatly reduce necessity peripheral venipuncture risk contrast extravasation . Therefore , implantable port endure high infusion pressure solution meet demand treatment surveillance . Furthermore , venous thrombus likely occur patient malignant tumor , must prevent may cause high in-hospital mortality rate . If loosen thrombus deliver venous return may lead serious complication , pulmonary embolism . Pulmonary artery angiography use way diagnosis . However , improvement image technology , compute tomography could utilize diagnosis . High quality image may achieve long contrast medium inject high velocity patient might risk get hurt extravasation contrast medium . After intravenous port could endure high injection pressure available , characteristic high volume profile could provide secure vascular route minimal risk extravasation . However , agreeable conclusion device may benefit survival patient . Although port endure high pressure infusion provide reliable intravenous route well medical image , benefit prognosis may bring port still unknown . Besides , national insurance n't reimburse new type infusion port due limit insurance budget . Therefore , investigator intend identify patient suitable implantation port view feature image tumor improve prognosis cancer patient .</detailed_description>
