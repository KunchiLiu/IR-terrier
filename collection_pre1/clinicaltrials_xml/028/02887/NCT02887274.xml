	<brief_summary>Persistence mark compensatory anti-inflammatory innate immune response insult term immunoparalysis . There biomarker available determine immune status patient . Thus , need early definite diagnosis immune status patient sepsis , well identification patient risk evolve severe organ dysfunction , crucial . Most important , speed key survival . Therefore , crucial importance identify patient characteristic determines poor prognosis . Early intervention improve prognosis . Investigators foresee urgent need identify predictor mortality severe sepsis , include clinical factor immune status . Recently , PIRO model propose way stratify septic patient accord Predisposing condition , severity Infection , Response therapy degree Organ dysfunction . The immune status may associate model . However , paucity data address issue . In study , investigator also analyze progression patient condition treatment associate immune status change . In future , Investigators hope determination immune status may contribute model classification rather use prognostic marker . Despite advance knowledge basic process trigger sustain systemic inflammatory response sepsis , search `` magic bullet '' treat syndrome frustrating . The incidence severe sepsis septic shock still remain quite high , mortality , decrease little past decade .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Binding TLRs epitope microorganisms stimulates intracellular signaling , increase transcription proinflammatory molecule tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) interleukin-1β , well antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 . Macrophage dysfunction , component immune suppression see trauma sepsis , appear one contributing factor morbidity mortality . Critically ill patient demonstrate prolonged , severe reduction monocyte HLA-DR expression ex vivo tumor necrosis factor alpha production high risk nosocomial infection death . Most septic patient decrease cytokine level time treatment , suggest transition hyperinflammatory hypo-inflammatory state . Immunoparalysis potentially reversible risk factor development nosocomial infection multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . Whole-blood ex vivo TNF alpha response promise marker monitoring condition . Investigators call `` stimulated immune response '' . Toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) recently describe family immune receptor involve recognition pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMPs ) . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) present out membrane Gram-negative bacteria demonstrate responsible development GNB-associated sepsis . Recognition bacterial LPS macrophage key component host defense infection Gram-negative bacteria . A monocyte encounter LPS vigorously produce proinflammatory cytokine regardless whether expose LPS past . Sepsis induces suppression macrophage function determine reduction pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon re-exposure lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) vitro . Whether ground gain manipulate innate immunity important question wait answer . Several strategy enhance innate immunity try normal subject , include use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor increase number activation state circulating neutrophil , IFN-γ enhance macrophage dependent immunity . Investigators use characteristic ass patient 's stimulate immune response . In addition , difference nature initiate agent cause sepsis lack co-morbidities animal model probably contribute difference animal study clinical trial sepsis . Investigators need address important issue work toward promote immunologic homeostasis ICU . Here investigator perform systematic study aim evaluate 1 . The diagnostic accuracy stimulate immune response predict mortality ; 2 . Whether trend change stimulate immune response useful prediction ; 3 . Whether stimulate immune response predict patient risk evolve severe organ dysfunction ( presence development severe sepsis progression organ dysfunction within 72-hr time period biomarker check along treatment )</detailed_description>
