	<brief_summary>The overarch goal propose research evaluate whether qualitative quantitative parameter real time contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) aid assess suspicious indeterminate cystic appear breast mass ultimately determine whether ultrasound guide biopsy necessary . The underlying hypothesis breast mass ( give BIRADS 4 ) lack enhancement CEUS benign histology obtain ultrasound guide core biopsy and/or surgery . Then , future , non-enhancing cystic lesion follow need biopsy intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystic Breast Masses Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer frequently diagnose cancer woman . To diagnose cancer , 1.6 million breast biopsy perform year United States , 60 % benign pathology . A large percentage benign biopsy show fibrocystic change breast histology . These biopsy avoid well diagnostic tool identify fibrocystic change . The Investigators propose contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) aid classify predict cystic appear breast mass benign malignant , supplemental image tool mammography conventional gray-scale ultrasound ( US ) . In standard clinical practice , breast mass appear cystic gray-scale US suspicious feature make difficult tell mass truly cystic solid , decision make follow-up versus biopsy difficult . This lead unnecessary biopsy ( false positive ) since many mass sequel benign fibrosis fibrocystic change breast . CEUS may help classify mass cystic solid . The central premise base microbubble contrast agent use CEUS , since stay within blood pool show enhancement mass solid component vascular flow . The Investigators hypothesize indeterminate cystic breast mass enhance CEUS correlate benign pathology . Quantitative CEUS parameter also help classify lesion . If case , future , non-enhancing cystic breast mass need biopsied . This decrease patient anxiety , unnecessary intervention , save resource . The investigator investigate qualitative quantitative parameter CEUS evaluate indeterminate cystic breast mass give BIRADS 4 correlate histopathology obtain biopsy and/or surgery . This data help develop protocol good distinguish benign malignant cystic appear breast mass .</detailed_description>
