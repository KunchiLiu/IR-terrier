	<brief_title>Humacyte 's HAV Femoro-Popliteal Bypass Patients With PAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label , single treatment arm , multicenter phase 2 study evaluate safety efficacy HAV patient PAD undergo femoro-popliteal bypass surgery . The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability HAV patient determine patency Humacyte HAV 12 month post-implantation . The secondary objective study assess safety term PRA response , determine rate HAV intervention require keep HAV patent . There formal hypothesis test plan ; study involve single , open-label treatment group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients disable symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 1 . Rutherford stage 4 5 require femoropopliteal bypass surgery 2 . Rutherford stage 3 severe claudication ( le 50 yard AND cause severe impairment ability work undertake social activity ) 2 . Ankle brachial index ≤ 0.6 study leg 3 . Patient fail adequate medical therapy include 1 . Exercise program 2 . Smoking cessation therapy 3 . Control diabetes , hypertension dyslipidemias 4 . Antiplatelet therapy 4 . Preoperative angiography CT angiography show superficial femoral artery occlusion AND require Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel ( HAV ) length ≤ 40cm . This imaging may conduct 6 month prior study entry provide patient 's symptom remain stable since time 5 . Preoperative imaging show least one knee vessel patent ankle good runoff 6 . Proximal HAV anastomosis expect common femoral artery inguinal ligament superficial femoral artery 7 . Distal anastomosis expect popliteal artery knee 8 . Femoral artery occlusion consider suitable endovascular treatment ; e.g . long segment chronic total occlusion , previous fail stent stent graft superficial femoral artery , previous fail endovascular treatment lesion could cross 9 . Autologous vein graft feasible judgment treat surgeon ; e.g . suitable vein use previously coronary peripheral bypass , preoperative vein mapping show inadequate length quality vein complete planned bypass 10 . Aged 18 85 year old , inclusive 11 . Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 screen 12 . Other hematological biochemical parameter within range consider acceptable administration general anesthesia screen 13 . Adequate liver function , define serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ; GGT ≤ 3x upper limit normal ; AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2x upper limit normal INR ≤ 1.5 screen 14 . Able communicate meaningfully investigative staff , competent give write informed consent , able comply entire study procedure 15 . Life expectancy least 1 year 1 . Leg high risk amputation ( SVS WIfI stage 4 ) 2 . Recent trauma leg receive HAV 3 . Severe active infection ( SVS foot infection grade 3 ) leg receive HAV 4 . Distal anastomosis plan knee artery 5 . History evidence severe cardiac disease ( NYHA Functional Class III IV ) , myocardial infarction within six month prior study entry ( Day 1 ) , ventricular tachyarrhythmias require continue treatment , unstable angina 6 . Stroke within six ( 6 ) month prior study entry ( Day 1 ) 7 . Chronic renal disease multiple administration contrast agent may pose increase risk nephrotoxicity ( eGFR &lt; 45mL/min ) 8 . Uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1c &gt; 10 % screening ) 9 . Treatment investigational drug device within 60 day prior study entry ( Day 1 ) 10 . Cancer actively treat cytotoxic agent 11 . AIDS / HIV infection 12 . Documented hypercoagulable state history 3 DVTs spontaneous intravascular thrombotic event within previous 5 year 13 . Bleeding diathesis 14 . Ongoing treatment vitamin K antagonists oral direct thrombin inhibitor factor Xa inhibitor ( e.g . dabigatran , apixaban rivaroxaban ) 15 . Previous arterial bypass surgery ( autologous vein synthetic graft ) operative leg 16 . Stenosis &gt; 50 % inflow aortoiliac system ipsilateral index leg . Any stenosis must correct angioplasty without stenting prior , time , HAV implantation 17 . Active autoimmune disease symptomatic require ongoing drug therapy 18 . Active local systemic infection ( WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3 ) 19 . Known serious allergy aspirin 20 . Any condition judgment investigator would preclude adequate evaluation safety efficacy Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel ( HAV ) 21 . Previous enrollment study 22 . Employees sponsor patient employee relative investigator 23 . Pregnant woman woman plan become pregnant ( Women child bear potential , WOCBP , must use adequate contraception [ hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ] duration study participation ; WOCBP define sterile &gt; 1 year postmenopausal . )</criteria>
