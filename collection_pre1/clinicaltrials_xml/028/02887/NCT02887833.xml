	<brief_summary>If cancer spread bone painful , especially try move around . One best treatment radiotherapy , give cancer centre . Even treatment , half people get good pain relief , take 6 week work fully . If know unlikely benefit , explore form pain relief sooner , without go radiotherapy unnecessarily . We find may simple way identify patient likely get good pain relief , use test change temperature sensation painful bone . This study explore whether simple bedside test use community set identify patient suffer cancer induce bone pain get good pain relief radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermal Testing Bone Pain ( TiBoP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone third common site metastatic disease , liver lung , ~75 per cent patient suffer related pain . Cancer-induced bone pain ( CIBP ) remain one major clinical challenge palliative care , number possible reason . Bone pain significant impact physical , psychological social functioning ( overall quality life ) . The mechanisms CIBP complex may unique characteristic different neuropathic inflammatory pain - clear implication manage CIBP effectively . Current gold standard treatment CIBP palliative radiotherapy ( XRT ) . Radiotherapy current standard treatment CIBP , although 55 % patient achieve adequate analgesia palliative radiotherapy , take 6 week work . There considerable interest clinical sign symptom pain translate underlying mechanism , may use direct treatment effectively . The clinical assessment somatosensory processing use neuropathic pain extensive , burdensome frail patient . The investigator develop modified assessment use patient cancer , use hospital setting . The investigator clinical pilot work use detailed phenotyping CIBP , try good understand underlie mechanism detect change somatosensory processing . The investigator find change temperature sensitivity may predict pain relief XRT . Following investigator propose develop simple bedside tool , suitable use community , potentially identify patient likely benefit radiotherapy . Development tool require adequate validation evaluation use aid decide patient likely benefit radiotherapy . In patient unlikely benefit , early identification would allow use symptom control strategy community , minimise burden unnecessary hospital attendance , avoid acute pain flare occur XRT . The investigator hypothesis alteration thermal sensitivity reflect important change underlie pain neurobiology make patient , less , likely get effective analgesia XRT . Assessment CIBP There recommendation suggest use pain measurement tool method clinical practice try include wide aspect pain experience ( www.immpact.org ) . In patient cancer , important minimise burden assessment . We therefore use simple approach try capture important element CIBP impact . This consist number validate self report questionnaire ( see ) , plus measurement skin sensitivity warm cool ( 40°C , 25°C ) , identify previous work potential predictor treatment response XRT . Self report measure include : Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) ; The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( SF-MPQ-2 ) ; Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale ( HADS ) ; Distress Thermometer ; EORTC health-related quality life questionnaire bone metastasis . Patients CIBP assess prior XRT , 2 , 6 12 week XRT .</detailed_description>
