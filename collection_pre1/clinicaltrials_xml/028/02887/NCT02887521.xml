The rationale need research lack well proven risk-reducing intervention may decrease morbidity lung cancer resection patient COPD may improve quality life trajectory , meaningful outcome overall disease progression . The propose intervention unique combine exercise behavioral intervention pilot test randomized single-blinded control design propose population prove feasible potentially effective . The aim test effect propose rehabilitation length stay , pulmonary complication quality life trajectory .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospectively , 194 patient randomize either ten session preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) vs. standard care number healthcare center throughout United States . This study open 36 month . Randomization stratify three variable : severe lung function ( yes vs. ) , prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy operation ( yes vs. ) open thoracotomy vs. video assist thoracoscopy . The primary secondary objective provide . Primary Objective : To prospectively determine effect 10 session customize preoperative PR length hospital stay patient undergo lung cancer resection COPD compare match control group . Hypothesis : Ten session customize preoperative PR significantly reduce length hospital stay . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To prospectively determine effect 10 session customize preoperative PR number postoperative complication patient undergo lung cancer resection COPD compare match control group . - Hypothesis : Ten session customize preoperative PR significantly reduce number postoperative pulmonary complication . 2 . To prospectively determine effect 10-session preoperative PR trajectory quality life 3 6 month curative resection compare match control group . - Hypothesis : Ten session customize preoperative PR significantly meaningfully ( minimal clinically important difference ) improve quality life surgery compare control group . Patients follow 3 6 month post-surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient schedule undergo NSCLC resection : video assist thoracoscopy ( VATS ) open thoracotomy : limited resection , lobectomy , pneumonectomy . Surgery must schedule take place &lt; 3 week registration . 2 . Patient doctor diagnosis COPD . 3 . Patient current exsmoker smoke history ≥ 10 pack year . ( Calculated multiplying number pack cigarettes smoked per day number year person smoke . For example , 1 packyear equal smoking 20 cigarette ( 1 pack ) per day 1 year , 40 cigarette per day half year , ) . 4 . Age ≥ 18 yr</criteria>
