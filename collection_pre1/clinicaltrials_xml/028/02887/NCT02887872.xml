	<brief_summary>Objective : To explore effectiveness combine neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( ES ) dynamic hand orthosis ( DHO ) regimen use small group person chronic stroke improve ability perform daily task . Method : Four participant chronic stroke participate combined ES-DHO regimen use affected upper extremity ( UE ) five time ( 5X ) per week 6 week . Outcome measure include grip strength , range motion ( ROM ) , analysis muscle activation/deactivation release grasp electromyography ( EMG ) . Ability perform daily functional task assess use Assessment Motor Process Skills ( AMPS ) . Results : Preliminary result suggest improvement strength , ROM grasp deactivation possible combine ES-DHO regimen . Ability perform daily functional task improve participant . Conclusion : Results interpret cautiously due pilot nature study small participant number . Further research area warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study explore outcome performance functional daily living task follow six-week combined regimen use ES SaeboFlex orthosis repetitive task training ( RTT ) four person chronic stroke . Functional outcome assess ( pre-post design ) six-week combine treatment regimen use DHO RTT follow regimen ES . Feasibility logistics translation preliminary result large , comprehensive control trial explore . Participants don orthosis affect upper extremity therapist assistance perform RTT grasp/release practice daily 30 minute , 5X/week 6 week ( 30 session ) .Following completion grasp/release practice , ES finger extensor muscle provide 15 minute . Goniometry measure range motion ( ROM ) wrist finger , dynamometry measure hand strength , electromyography ( EMG ) collection measure muscle activation/deactivation , AMPS test measure functional activity performance perform start intervention ( baseline ) one day final training session . Gains grip strength , 3rd metacarpophalangeal ( MP ) flexion , AMPS motor score , improve deactivation grasp observe participant . Wrist extension , 3rd MP extension , AMPS process score , EMG root mean square ( RMS ) time release grasp improve three four participants.These preliminary pilot result begin suggest gain make impairment area strength , ROM , functional movement pattern grasp release combine ES-DHO program individual chronic stroke . Perhaps importantly , result may indicate type training may translate improvement performance daily live task . Completion work suggest large trial feasible logistically able perform . The preliminary data limit four volunteer chronic stroke study , small number involve restrict generalization effectiveness comprehensive analysis outcome .</detailed_description>
