	<brief_summary>Patients ≥ 3 year age newly-diagnosed , diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma enrol study . However , primary objective study 1 ) compare overall survival , time randomization death cause , study subject 3-21 year age newly-diagnosed , diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma receive Antineoplaston therapy ( Atengenal + Astugenal ) + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone 2 ) describe toxicity profile ( subject ) Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone . A secondary objective compare progression-free survival study subject 3-21 year age newly-diagnosed , diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma treat Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Antineoplaston Therapy + Radiation v . Radiation Only Diffuse , Intrinsic , Brainstem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized Phase 3 protocol study Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone subject ≥ 3 year age newly-diagnosed , diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma . In subject randomize Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy , Antineoplaston therapy administer 104 week radiation therapy commences day one Antineoplaston therapy continue 6 week . Subjects continue Antineoplaston therapy objective response stable disease achieve therapy maintain Antineoplaston therapy end protocol study unless develop progressive disease . Subjects randomized radiation therapy alone receive 6 week radiation therapy . Exploratory objective compare follow two treatment arm : 1 ) overall survival study subject ≥ 21 year age ; 2 ) progression-free survival subject ≥ 21 year age ; 3 ) objective response , complete response , partial response , progressive disease rate , base enhance portion tumor , subject , use bidimentional measurement tumor ; 4 ) objective response , complete response , partial response , progressive disease rate , subject non-enhancing tumor , use unidimentional measurement tumor ; 5 ) objective response , complete response , partial response , progressive disease rate , base enhance + non-enhancing portion tumor , subject , use unidimentional measurement tumor .</detailed_description>
