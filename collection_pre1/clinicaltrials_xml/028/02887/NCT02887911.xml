	<brief_title>Characterization Adults Asthma Microbiome Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational , two-visit study approximately 200 subject enrol , include healthy control , atopic control without asthma , patient stable asthma ( n = 150 ) . Among asthmatic , 2/3 regular inhale corticosteroid therapy 1/3 take inhaled corticosteroid . Subjects meet study criterion undergo phenotypic characterization multiple domain , include evaluation lung function , assessment asthma/allergy history , asthma trigger , asthma symptom control , environmental microbial exposure dietary intake . Oral rinse , sputum , stool , urine blood specimen collect microbiome-related analysis , include molecular culture-based assay , metabolite study , relate marker inflammation immune function . The overall goal enroll cohort well-characterized asthmatic non-asthmatic control subject enable mechanism-oriented study member airway microbiota possibly also gut microbiota influence phenotype adult asthma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . For subject : Inclusion criterion : Men/Women , age 1875 , without current asthma , eligible screen . Exclusion criterion : Cigarette smoke history &gt; 30 total packyears Current use smoke product recreational drug ( e.g . pipe , cigar , ecigarettes , illicit drug ) History lung disease asthma Recent upper respiratory tract infection treat antibiotic within 12 week visit 1 Recent antibiotic use ( except topical ocular ) within 12 week visit 1 Currently pregnant breastfeed Other medical condition treatment may increase subject risk affect study result , base study physician judgment . These include following : significant cardiovascular disease ( +/ active symptom ) , arrhythmia , stroke , active cancer , postorgan transplant Any condition subject take immunosuppressive therapy ( except steroid asthma ) History allergy albuterol methacholine 2 . For asthma subject : Note : Enrollment target 90 asthmatic already take inhaled corticosteroid prescribe physician ( formulation dose ) 60 subject currently use inhale corticosteroid . Additional inclusion criterion : History asthma symptom within last 2 year ( e.g . wheeze , shortness breath , etc . ) Evidence stable asthma assess initial screen No change asthma medication within 30 day visit 1 Methacholine PC20 ( dose 20 percent change ) ≤ 8 mg/ml ( asthmatic inhale steroid , PC20 ≤ 16 mg/ml ) , change FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume first second spirometry effort ) ≥ 12 % 4 puff albuterol reversibility test Additional exclusion criterion : An asthma exacerbation require treatment oral IV steroid within 2 month visit 1 FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict 4 puff albuterol ( albuterol give either bronchodilator reversibility test administer methacholine challenge , FEV1 measure prior sputum induction ) 3 . For healthy control atopic nonasthma subject : Additional exclusion criterion : Evidence abnormal lung function follow : FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 , FEV1 FVC ( force vital capacity spirometry ) &lt; 80 % predict , methacholine PC20 &lt; 16 mg/ml , FEV1 improvement &gt; 12 % response albuterol</criteria>
