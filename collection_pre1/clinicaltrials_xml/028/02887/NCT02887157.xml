	<detailed_description>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) disorder development neural retina vasculature may impact vision vulnerable preterm neonate lifetime . Clinical care infant ROP decrease likelihood blindness , abnormal vision common , especially disease severe enough require treatment . Because possible distinguish whether disease and/or maldevelopment affect specific retinal cell and/or central nervous system ( CNS ) cause vision loss , especially less severe , strategy prevent subnormal acuity majority infant treat ROP . The interval preterm infant risk ROP spend intensive care nursery ( ICN ) time rapid retinal development . Clinicians researcher know local , CNS systemic development disease process reflect retinal microanatomy . Abnormalities retina infancy likely early predictor later vision problem developmental delay . From study preterm retinal substructure , brain anatomy , connectivity functional network neuroinflammatory biomarkers study elucidate pathway local retinal anatomic change impact may predict later subnormal vision CNS function . The result research enable investigator : distinguish ocular non-ocular contribution vision loss ; guide future treatment direct modify retinal anomaly edema ; determine microanatomic retinal biomarkers best monitor effect ROP , effect systemic therapy eye brain . In contrast indirect ophthalmoscopy photography , novel non-contact ocular imaging bedside would enable direct telemedicine screen ROP neural development multiple nursery . The long-term goal help improve preterm infant health care via objective bedside image analysis characterizes early critical indicator poor vision , neurological development ROP . This rapidly translate early intervention improve future vision care . Specific goal research threefold : implement technological innovation improve optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image non-sedated infant ICN ; distinguish element retinal microanatomy predict maldevelopment visual pathway poor neurodevelopment may impact vision preterm infant ; delineate element region ( posterior peripheral ) preterm infant OCT-derived retinal microanatomy best inform u severity disease visual outcomes infant ROP . In addition provide breakthrough method bedside analysis preterm ( VPT ) infant posterior peripheral retina , study provide pediatric ophthalmologic telemedicine community method distinguish microanatomic marker predict infant risk abnormal vision , visual pathway injury , poor functional development progression ROP ( combination thereof ) . These biomarkers useful determine ophthalmic CNS therapeutic intervention monitor impact visual pathway thus likely cross relevance infant eye brain disease .</detailed_description>
