	<brief_summary>Until recently , Mount Sinai Hospital ( MSH ) , epidural analgesia labor pain deliver pump could provide continuous infusion freeze medication combination push medication activate patient , technique call patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) . In last decade , literature suggest continuous infusion medication effective thought , suggest instead continuous infusion use intermittent program push . We device able . Programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) new technological advance base concept bolus freeze medication epidural space superior continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) . Recently switch epidural pump MSH , new pump able deliver bolus medication regular interval ( PIEB ) , addition patient deliver ( PCEA ) . Studies show deliver analgesia manner prolong duration analgesia , reduce motor block , low incidence breakthrough pain , improve maternal satisfaction decrease local anesthetic consumption . We recently conclude study MSH use PIEB observe excellent result . However , study observed patient exhibit high necessary sensory block . We believe optimize technique use interval previous study small volume intermittent bolus . We also believe optimize technique may able reduce even amount medication use patient . The hypothesis study optimal volume PIEB bolus fix interval 40 minute 0.0625 % bupivacaine plus fentanyl 2mcg/ml provide 90 % woman necessary drug requirement first stage labor ( EV90 ) , thus avoid breakthrough pain need PCEA physician intervention . We hypothesize effective volume 7 12 mL ( 6.6 mg/hr 11.3 mg/hr bupivacaine ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies involve programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) date provide analgesic regimen deliver amount local anesthetic patient 's requirement per hour , study do context association patient control epidural anesthesia ( PCEA ) rescue technique . As result , PCEA request frequent therefore study able truly understand pharmacology bolus technique PIEB regimen , PCEA utilize patient add extra component regimen . At Mount Sinai Hospital , PIEB device recently introduce . Currently standard epidural mixture bupivacaine 0.0625 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml . Based previous research do investigator , current epidural regimen consist 10 ml PIEB 40 minute interval , PCEA boluses 5 ml lock interval 10 minute , maximum 20 ml epidural mixture per hour . In study , investigator vary volume bolus ( 7-12 mL ) bupivacaine 0.0625 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml . PCEA bolus 5mL solution also available . The goal establish ideal PIEB volume effective patient population .</detailed_description>
