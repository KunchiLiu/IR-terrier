	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer 5th lead cause cancer death bad prognostic cancer world . This due high recurrent rate surgical resection poor response chemotherapy radiotherapy . Recent study reveal peri-tumoral structure patient ' immune status include cytotoxic immunity play significant role bad behavior pancreatic cancer . While past study focus oncogene tumor suppressor gene , recent study focus patient ' immunity . Patients ' immunity modify cancer cell find correlate cancer progression metastasis . Natural killer cell , play important role cytotoxic immune system , reveal decreased patient lung cancer , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , colorectal cancer , breast cancer . And melanoma mouse model , NK cell suppress , cancer progression metastasis accelerate . This study seek find correlation patient ' cytotoxic immune status cancer progression status measurement NK cell activity pancreatic cancer patient . This would basic support construct prognostic model pancreatic cancer early metastasis post operational recurrence .</brief_summary>
