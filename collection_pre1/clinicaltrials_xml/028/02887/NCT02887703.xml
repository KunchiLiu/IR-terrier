	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness 12-week home balance training program without sensory augmentation individual ataxia . Subjects wear belt perform balance exercise three time per week 12 week . The belt measure body motion small vibrating element call tactors mount inside turn , feel like cell phone set vibrate . The tactors provide information body motion indicate make postural correction . Subjects receive six week balance training tactors turn six week balance training tactors turn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebellar ataxia group degenerative neurological disorder , result deficit speech , limb control , balance , gait . Individuals degenerative cerebellar ataxia high-risk fall progressive impairment motor coordination result unsteadiness gait posture . No definitive treatment option available ataxia . There therefore critical need identify strategy improve motor function reduce fall patient ataxia . Physical therapy demonstrate improve motor function subject cerebellar ataxia , gain performance follow balance training modest . Sensory augmentation technique augment replace compromised sensory information . In context sensory-based balance impairment , sensory augmentation device provide cue body motion supplement individual 's remain intact sensory system . The investigator hypothesize sensory augmentation may improve effectiveness balance training individual ataxia , aid great improvement motor function traditional physical therapy alone . Sensory augmentation show decrease body sway real-time operation laboratory set individual vestibular deficit peripheral neuropathy , general age-related decline balance performance . Preliminary result suggest persistent improvement balance performance exist time period hour day follow small number training session . This study aim characterize effect sensory augmentation individual ataxia static dynamic balance exercise period twelve week home balance training without vibrotactile sensory augmentation .</detailed_description>
