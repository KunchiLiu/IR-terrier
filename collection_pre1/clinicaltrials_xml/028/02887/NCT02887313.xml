	<brief_summary>Preoperative 5FU base chemoradiotherapy still standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer . About 15-20 % patient would achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) neoadjuvant CRT , survival outcome much good non-pCR . We aim enhance neoadjuvant treatment , add mFOLFOX6 CRT radiotherapy , improve pathologic outcome survival outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preoperative 5FU base chemoradiotherapy still standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer . About 15-20 % patient would achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) neoadjuvant CRT , survival outcome much good non-pCR . However , distant metastasis would occur 30 % patient even CRT . To improve survival rectal cancer patient , hope improve pCR rate . In previous FOWARC study , mFOLFOX6 radiation pCR rate 27.5 % . It report add FOLFOX neoadjuvant chemo radiation locally advanced rectal cancer would improve pCR rate . Here , go choose mFOLFOX6 neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , radiotherapy , another 4-6 cycle mFOLFOX6 would give surgery . With intensive neoadjuvant treatment , high pCR rate might observe .</detailed_description>
