	<brief_title>Ethical , Legal , Social Issues Substudy Relation GTEx Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Genotype Tissue Expression Project ( GTEx ) partnership multiple NIH agency fund Common Fund . Families agree donation organ tissue transplantation ask authorize collection additional tissue GTEx participate Organ Procurement Organizations ( OPO ) . Donated tissue place National Cancer Institute biobank , donor 's genome medical record information analyze release researcher NIH 's database Genotypes Phenotypes ( dbGaP ) . The tissue information keep biobank indefinitely cell line may develop donate skin blood . An ethical , legal social issue ( ELSI ) sub-study examines issue surround risk privacy breach confidentiality family decision maker ( FDM ) well FDM perspectives return finding donor family . The ELSI sub-study assess authorization process make suggestion improvement . Semi-structured interview complete family decide donate GTEx well refuse donate project . Tissue requester ( TR ) make GTEx approach participate OPOs , also ask complete online survey approach complete GTEx . The study build research team 's extensive work organ tissue donation work currently conduct ELSI pilot GTEx project . Specifically , investigator propose examine impact stress complex information donor family ' decision-making inform consent process ; understand variation requester , consent approach , characteristic family decision maker affect understand , recall willingness donate tissue research ; consider ethical legal issue request consent process ; , test novel intervention design train tissue requester employ effective communication technique make request tissue . The overall goal develop set recommendation maximize likelihood family decision maker ( FDM ) make informed donation decision stressful circumstance . The specific aim ELSI GTEx study : This study build research team 's extensive work organ tissue donation work currently conduct ELSI pilot GTEx project . Specifically , investigator propose examine impact stress complex information decision make donor family inform consent process , understand variation requester , consent approach , characteristic family decision maker affect understand recall willingness donate tissue research , consider ethical legal issue request consent process , test intervention train tissue requester employ effective communication technique make request tissue . The overall goal develop set recommendation maximize likelihood family decision maker ( FDM ) make informed donation decision stressful circumstance . The specific aim ELSI GTEx study : 1 . Identify element nonverbal relational communication impact FDM knowledge , recall GTEx decision making . Using method procedure pilot study , investigator conduct observational study GTEx request process understand communication-related variable impact FDM knowledge , recall decision making . In addition , subsample audiotape obtain tissue-only donor whose consent conversation conduct telephone audiotaped . This provide information important nonverbal relational element communication outcome variable . H1a . Sociodemographic characteristic FDM impact major outcome interest study ( recall , comprehension consent ) . Specifically , FDM education , white , female younger likely donate , good recall knowledge . H1b . Relational element communication , confirmational message ( e.g. , message express validation acceptance ) persuasive tactic credibility , altruism , esteem , engage lengthy conversation associate great likelihood donate well recall knowledge . H1c . Tissue requester ' FDMs ' comfort speaking GTEx , proclivity FDMs ask question engage proactively conversation associate great likelihood donate well recall knowledge . 2 . Conduct study , use quasi-experimental design , understand impact stressful environment request occur . This study assist ELSI team obtain evidence base allow u disentangle effect stress complexity information purpose donation guide recommendation final consent process . 3 . Adapt test communication intervention target tissue requester ' ( TR ) use effective , ethically acceptable technique maximize likelihood consent . H3a . Post intervention , TRs exhibit relational communication FDMs request . H3b . Post intervention , TRs spend time attend emotional need FDMs . H3c . Post intervention , TRs spend time discuss information identify important informed decision make tissue donation . H3d . Post intervention , overall high consent rate donation research .</detailed_description>
