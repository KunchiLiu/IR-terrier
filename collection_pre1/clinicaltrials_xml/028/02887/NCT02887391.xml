This study follow 10 patient conventional dialysis 10 patient in-centre nocturnal dialysis 6 month compare food intake , muscle mass , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) nutrition-related lab test . The purpose study determine whether improvement nutritional status in-centre nocturnal hemodialysis patient compare nutritional status conventional hemodialysis patient .</brief_summary>
