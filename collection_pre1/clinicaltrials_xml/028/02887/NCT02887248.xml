	<brief_title>Nab-paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine First-line Therapy Cisplatin-ineligible Cisplatin-incurable Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized phase II trial evaluate efficacy toxicity first-line treatment combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel , follow maintenance therapy nab-paclitaxel alone patient metastatic locally advanced unresectable urothelial cancer . Two group patient eligible : ( 1 ) patient poor candidate treatment cisplatin , ( 2 ) patient visceral metastasis incurable unlikely derive long-term benefit treatment cisplatin-based regimen . Eligible patient receive minimum 3 cycle 6 cycle treatment gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel combination . Patients objective response stable disease continue maintenance treatment single-agent nab-paclitaxel disease progression , intolerable toxicity , patient decision discontinue treatment . Up 55 patient planned enrollment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>KEY POINTS : 1 . Histologically confirm diagnosis urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) either metastatic ( N+ M1 ) locally advanced unresectable ( T4bN0 ) . A component urothelial ( transitional cell ) carcinoma require . 2 . Two group patient eligible : 1 . Poor candidate cisplatinbased chemotherapy base presence ≥ 1 following : Glomerular filtration rate 3060 ml/min ( CockcroftGault formula ) ECOG performance status score 2 Hearing loss ( trouble communicate hear aid hear loss ≤ 3 KHz ) Grade ≥3 heart failure Age ≥80 year Other concurrent illness may make patient poor candidate receiving cisplatin . Note : Enrollment patient 2 criterion occur careful consideration treat physician regard patient 's ability tolerate combination chemotherapy . OR 2 . Poor prognosis define cisplatinincurable due presence metastasis least one visceral site ( patient require cisplatinineligibility criterion ) . ECOG performance status score 0 , 1 , 2 . 3 . Measurable evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . 4 . Patients brain metastasis allow treatment complete least 4 week prior study treatment , neurologic symptom minimal stable precede 4 week , maintenance dexamethasone require . 5 . Adequate hematologic , liver kidney function . 6 . Willingness ability comply study requirement give write informed consent . 1 . Previous systemic chemotherapy UC exception perioperative ( neoadjuvant adjuvant ) treatment treatment concurrent chemoradiation locally advanced disease . All treatment must complete 1 year previously . 2 . Presence smallcell sarcomatoid component tumor histology . 3 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 4 . Major surgical procedure ≤28 day begin study drug , minor surgical procedure ≤7 day . No wait require follow portacath placement . 5 . Cardiac disease currently within last 6 month : 6 . Inadequately controlled hypertension . 7 . Currently receive treatment therapeutic dos warfarin sodium . ( A maximum daily dose 1 mg permit port line patency . Low molecular weight heparin allow . ) 8 . Serious active infection time treatment , another serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . 9 . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis B hepatitis C ( screen disease required. ) . 10 . Presence active cancer , history treatment invasive cancer ≤5 year previously . Patients Stage I cancer receive definitive local treatment consider unlikely recur eligible . All patient previously treat situ carcinoma ( i.e. , noninvasive ) eligible , patient history nonmelanoma skin cancer .</criteria>
