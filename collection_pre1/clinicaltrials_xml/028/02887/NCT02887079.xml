	<brief_summary>EMBOL-EI ( Research Interest antiphospholipid antibody embolic risk prediction infective endocarditis ) prospective cohort study biological collection . The main objective : re-evaluate potential value antiphospholipid ( aPL ) antibodies predictor embolic event IE light improved current knowledge aPL . The seconds objective : Other plasma biomarkers hemostasis ( coagulation activation marker : D-dimer fragment 1 + 2 prothrombin ; endothelial biomarkers : plasma level von Willebrand factor ) take account analysis , interest predict embolic risk , alone combination aPL investigate .</brief_summary>
