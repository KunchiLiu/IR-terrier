	<brief_title>Evaluation Spine Surgery Analgesic Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial compare `` spine surgery analgesic pathway '' `` usual care '' improve postoperative quality recovery pain management spine surgery patient . At time surgery office visit time preoperative assessment anesthesia care team , risk factor suboptimal pain management identify document . Patients assessed time surgical office visit risk severe post-operative pain . Patients 2 risk factor classify high-risk severe postoperative pain patient less 2 factor low risk . After obtain informed consent spine surgery patient randomize 1:1 one 2 study group day surgery : 1 . `` Usual care '' group A 2 . `` Care pathway '' group B If participant randomize `` spine surgery analgesic pathway '' group participant evaluate Acute Pain Management Service ( APMS ) surgery specific pain management need . The participant also get additional medication pain preoperative intraoperative period . Before surgery participant receive Acetaminophen Gabapentin pill . During surgery , participant asleep participant receive infusion ketamine lidocaine participant venous line . After surgery participant receive pain medication per current standard protocol include acetaminophen gabapentin . Pain management team specialist follow pain control surgery need . If participant randomize `` usual care '' group participant give placebo preoperatively ; rest time pain medication provide routine manner per anesthesia care team surgical team . Pain management team specialist follow pain control surgery need . The primary outcome assess post-operative day 3 : The participant complete short survey quality recovery .</detailed_description>
