	<brief_title>Epicardial Infarct Repair Using CorMatrix®-ECM : Clinical Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Following ischemic injury extracellular matrix ( ECM ) heart adversely remodels lead cardiac fibrosis , leave ventricular ( LV ) dilatation subsequent heart failure . Preclinical evidence suggest epicardial application healthy biologic ECM may reverse adverse ECM remodel take place follow ischemic injury prevent LV dilatation subsequent heart failure . The investigator demonstrate epicardial infarct repair CorMatrix-ECM restores damage ECM , prevent LV dilatation improve myocardial performance . The investigator believe epicardial infarct repair may restrain infarcted myocardium prevent infarct expansion LV dilatation , owe 's biologic nature , help provide healthy ECM environment restore ECM homeostasis architecture . The investigator therefore propose clinical investigation epicardial infarct repair patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery within 6 week follow acute myocardial infarction adjunct surgical revascularization . This patient population commonly refer CABG surgery . While complete surgical revascularization prevent ischemic insult salvage stun hibernate myocardium , restore function infarcted myocardium result acute ischemic injury . The investigator 's previous study suggest epicardial infarct repair adjunct CABG surgery patient population may help improve myocardial function previously untreatable territory . STUDY DESIGN : This open-label , non-randomized , feasibility pilot study PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : • To evaluate feasibility epicardial infarct repair perform CorMatrix-ECM adjunct CABG surgery patient undergo surgery subacute period follow myocardial infarction ( MI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate feasibility identify infarct area treat epicardial infarct repair measure regional function tissue characteristic within treated area use cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging . - To evaluate safety epicardial infarct repair perform CorMatrix-ECM adjunct CABG surgery . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : Eight SUBJECT SELECTION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria : - The patient diagnose acute ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) ( confirm ST change serial ECG , elevate troponin , coronary artery stenosis occlusion identify angiography , wall motion abnormality identify angiography echocardiography ) - The patient schedule undergo coronary artery bypass surgery within 6 week acute event . - The patient posse contraindication CMR . - The patient great 35-years age , English speaking , capable give informed consent . - The patient geographically accessible willing return follow-up investigation clinical visit associate study . Exclusion Criteria : - The patient age 75 year . - The patient previous MI ( qualify event ) and/or scar non-viable myocardium identify CMR LV territory . - The patient undergo cardiac surgery ( i.e . concurrent cardiac valve , aortic surgery ) . - The patient require emergency surgery ( i.e . operative intervention ( CABG ventricular assist device ) within 24-hrs assessment ) . - The patient undergone previous cardiac surgery . - The patient 's postsurgical life expectancy le 45 day , investigator 's opinion . - The patient excessively poor baseline health , health-related quality life , physical functioning would preclude reasonable expect post-operative recovery . - The patient receive radiotherapy chest wall , receive immunosuppressive therapy , way immunocompromised . - The patient history malignancy within past year ( squamous basal cell carcinoma , treat without evidence recurrence ) . - The patient recent history drug alcohol abuse . - The patient within 30-days enrollment anytime study participate drug device study . - The patient know allergy CorMatrix-ECM material component material . - Absence non-viable myocardium within LV CMR . TEST PRODUCT , DOSE , AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION : CorMatrix-ECM surgically apply epicardial surface anterior LV wall time coronary artery bypass surgery . CONTROL PRODUCT , DOSE AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION : No control group perform pilot trial . DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION AND DURATION OF STUDY : Subjects involve study 6 month . Screening/Enrollment : 0-6 week acute coronary syndrome presentation CABG surgery . Treatment : Day CABG surgery . Follow-up : 6 month postoperatively . Total duration study expect 9 month . Three month subject enrollment 6 month final subject follow-up . CONCOMMITANT MEDICATIONS : Prohibited : Immunosuppressive medication ( include steroid ) . Allowed : Any medication . FEASIBILITY EVALUATIONS : Feasibility access qualitative evaluation perform surgeon successful measurement cardiac function tissue characterization CMR . PRIMARY ENDPOINT : • Feasibility epicardial infarct repair perform CorMatrix-ECM adjunct CABG surgery patient undergo surgery subacute period follow myocardial infarction ( MI ) evaluate perform surgeon though qualitative observation . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS : - Feasibility measure regional myocardial function tissue characteristic within treated area use cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging . - The safety epicardial infarct repair perform CorMatrix-ECM . SAFETY EVALUATIONS : Adverse event include : cause mortality ; cardiovascular mortality ; MACCE ; major bleed event ; primary surgical site infection ; myocardial constriction record . RATIONALE FOR NUMBER OF STUDY SUBJECTS : This pilot study design access feasibility perform epicardial infarct repair CorMatrix-ECM subacute MI patient go CABG surgery , feasibility measure cardiac function various tissue characteristic within treated myocardium CMR patient population , safety epicardial infarct repair perform time CABG surgery . Given preliminary nature study 8 subject test confirm feasibility inform future randomize control trial study design .</detailed_description>
