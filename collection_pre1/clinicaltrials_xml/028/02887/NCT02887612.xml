	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer one common malignant tumor China , withrelatively high incident rate mortality among population . 95 % gastric cancer adenocarcinoma . 70 % patient early stage show obvious symptom , small number nausea , vomit , symptom similar peptic ulcer disease . Surgery conventional treatment option early middle stage gastric cancer , postoperative relapse major issue . Currently , proven effective chemotherapy gastric cancer taxane platinum-based combination therapy . Also due molecular heterogeneity , prognosis gastric caner highly varied among patient . Therefore , many effective target therapy available treatment gastric cancer ; currently , trastuzumab apatinib two target drug clinically approve CFDA . Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) tumor-derived fragmented DNA average size 166 bp , mixed cell free DNA ( cfDNA ) source blood circulation ( 2 , 3 ) . Although mechanisms release fully address , report consider apoptosis and/or necrosis tumor cell main source , make genomic reservoir different tumor clone ( 4 ) . Also , half-life hour , ctDNA reflect up-to-date status tumor genome ( 5 ) . Hence , consider new biomarker tumor , qualitative , quantitative use disease monitoring . By monitor serum ctDNA mutational profile use Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) , present clinical trial aim elucidate correlation serum ctDNA status prognosis patient early intermediate-stage gastric cancer upon surgical treatment , explore possibility clinical utility serum ctDNA clinical index predict postoperative relapse . Moreover , compare molecular profile patient different prognosis , may also screen molecular marker related prognosis gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
