	<brief_summary>The purpose study test low cost , non-invasive , wearable near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) sensor , previously validate able-bodied athlete rehabilitation aid war-fighters low extremity limb loss . This sensor record real-time physiologic data relates total fitness capacity exertion level may help develop individualized program per-patient basis . The uniqueness NIRS measurement system provide real-time muscular oxygenation , dehydration , iron status whole-body exercise , well training-induced adaptation . Currently , technology like test amputee population . Successfully validate technology wound warrior population would provide vital information regard tissue perfusion injury new opportunity improve rehabilitation outcome .</brief_summary>
