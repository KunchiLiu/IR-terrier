	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary failure major public health concern , due age population . Each situation burden poor prognosis medium term source prolong hospitalization , generate significant health cost . Early detection prediction organ failure could reduce health cost risk patient , offer reaction early appropriate medical technology . The propose approach aim optimize knowledge complex physiological domain multi-system , promote automatic transfer knowledge . The approach propose data-mining development algorithm detect / predict strong potential disruption propose apply innovative automate analysis procedure fragile patient population , transfer medical device industry . From communicate tool record signal , investigator envisage global way : 1. constitution warehouse physiological data grown-up patient acute situation ( intensive care unit ) ; 2. development data mining system detection organs failure adverse event base application innovative algorithm , allow decision-making operational , fusion arisen ill-assorted event ; 3. use intelligent tool auto-learning elaboration complex multimodal model purpose prediction event ;</detailed_description>
