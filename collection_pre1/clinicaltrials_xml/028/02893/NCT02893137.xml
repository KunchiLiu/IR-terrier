	<brief_summary>The present study propose new potentially superior clinical approach Optune™ therapy select glioblastoma patient . The approach base combine TTFields target surgical skull remodeling , minor craniectomy distribution burr hole , design individual patient . Pre-clinical modeling result suggest procedure may enhance induced electrical field strength ~100 % thereby potentially improve clinical outcome treat patient significant extent . The study open label phase 1 clinical pilot experiment design investigate feasibility , safety efficacy concept . Fifteen patient first recurrence glioblastoma include trial . All patient receive TTFields therapy target craniotomy best physician 's choice chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
