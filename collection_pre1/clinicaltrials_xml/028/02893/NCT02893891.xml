	<brief_summary>Literature data clearly demonstrate treatment obese patient expensive , long achieve weight loss may permanent , regardless whether treatment dominate diet therapy , physical activity , pharmacotherapy . Experience last decade show surgical interventional treatment obesity occur long-term ( 10 year ) weight loss 35-40 % , also important endocrine change . In recent year , discover number signal molecule produce adipose tissue , whose physiological significance beyond general metabolic aspect organism . The fat therefore currently understood endocrine organ whose hormone modulate function many system , include skeleton . These hormone include adipokines modulate metabolism skeleton tissue level ( Leptin , Adiponectin ) indirectly - activation neurohumoral hypothalamic center - Leptin . Studying endocrine interaction adipose tissue bone highly topical issue . This mutual communication homeostatic feedback system adipokines molecule secrete osteoblast osteoclast connect link active ax fat - bone tissue . However , mechanism axis remain largely unknown .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Changes After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity important medical problem . The number obese individual increase continuously response various environmental genetic factor . For morbidly obese patient , surgery effective type therapy . Despite bariatric surgery good outcome term weight loss , associate adverse effect : several study report subsequent alteration bone metabolism . Of surgical technique available ( laparoscopic gastric banding , Roux-en-Y bypass , biliopancreatic diversion ) , laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) currently technique choice . Because restrictive procedure LSG involve bypass segment small bowel micronutrient absorption take place , few metabolic disturbance expect surgical technique . The observed change bone metabolism status post-bariatric surgery patient potentially involve several mechanism , include reduce absorption essential nutrient , diminish calcium absorption lead secondary hyperparathyroidism , poor vitamin D absorption restrict energy delivery . In addition , body weight protect osteoporosis via bone-strengthening effect long-term weight bearing . However , long-term decrease bone mineral density patient undergone successful bariatric surgery unexpected , negative effect type therapy . In study , parameter fat bone tissue body composition change assess group bariatric patient LSG , gastric plication intragastric balloon treatment . Other anticipated benefit study treatment include improve quality life . lt also lead introduction new process , material method . lt also possible expect shorten hospital stay , decrease postoperative morbidity , possibility perform procedure outpatient basis . The study design prospective study , conformity principle guideline Helsinki Declaration , good clinical practice approve Ethical Committee Faculty Medicine , University Ostrava . The patient enrol study follow period twelve month . Timetable study procedure control : Preoperative examination : - Demographic data age , sex , weight , height , smoke - Assessment body composition sample blood - Questionnaires quality Life Examination 3 month postoperatively - Assessment body composition sample blood - Questionnaires quality Life Examination 6 month surgery - Assessment body composition sample blood - Questionnaires quality Life Examination 12 month surgery - Assessment body composition sample blood - Questionnaires quality Life Statistical data process statistical evaluation descriptive statistic use ( arithmetical average , standard deflection , frequency table ) , X2 test , Fisher 's exact test , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , calculate OR ( odds ratio ) 95 % confidence interval , logistic regression . Statistical test evaluate significance level 5 % . Statistical analysis perform `` Stata 10 '' programme . Program EpiData use data collection .</detailed_description>
