	<detailed_description>Study Groups If agree take part study , assign 1 2 group base availability live within 25 mile MD Anderson : - If Group 1 , take part supervise exercise program . - If Group 2 , take part exercise program . Length Study Participation No matter group , participation study complete chemotherapy surgery . Study Visits For All Participants : At Beginning Study : They MRI check status disease . They physical test . Depending health , 6-minute walk test 6-minute arm test . If 6-minute walk test , time 6 minute see far walk course set near clinic . If 6-minute arm test , exercise arm 6 minute use upper body ergometer ( UBE ) much like pedal bike . After First Round Chemotherapy : They physical test . After 5-6 Weeks Chemotherapy : They MRI check status disease . Right Before Surgery : They MRI check status disease . They physical test . For Group 1 Only : They ask exercise physical therapist least 3 time week throughout chemotherapy ( 10-12 week ) . They offer chance exercise 5 time week . They take part exercise session 40 minute unless unable complete . What session base ability physical therapist may give physical test see best . During session , use either stationary bicycle UBE 20 minute . Following brief rest break , ask perform 10 minute upper and/or low body stretch strengthen exercise . Finally , 10 minute activity base exercise session , use Nintendo Wii , dribble basketball , shoot basketball hoop , bean bag toss , light physical activity . They physical therapist may stop exercise time severe pain symptom . While exercise , wear small device call portal pulse oximeter . This measure blood pressure , heart rate , much oxygen blood .

Physical activity include activity work muscle require energy rest ( house chore , walk , biking , outdoor play ) .</detailed_description>
