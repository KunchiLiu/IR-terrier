	<brief_title>Olaparib With Without Cediranib Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity combination cediranib olaparib , measure radiographic progression free survival ( rPFS ) , compare olaparib monotherapy patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity combination cediranib olaparib , measure prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate , radiographic response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 , overall survival ( OS ) , compare olaparib monotherapy patient mCRPC . II . To evaluate association homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair deficiency ( HRD ) clinical activity combination cediranib olaparib olaparib monotherapy , measure rPFS , mCRPC patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize genomic alteration whole exome sequence mCRPC patient correlate clinical activity resistance olaparib without cediranib . II . To characterize change ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) expression DNA repair gene , angiogenesis marker , immune marker , whole transcriptome sequence correlate clinical activity resistance olaparib without cediranib . III . To characterize change immune tumor microenvironment mCRPC patient profile expression co-stimulatory co-inhibitory molecule tumor infiltrate lymphocyte , correlate clinical activity resistance olaparib without cediranib . IV . To identify baseline predictive biomarkers rPFS response identify on-treatment marker acquire resistance men mCRPC receive either olaparib plus cediranib olaparib alone . V. To explore biomarker signature correlate clinical activity resistance olaparib without cediranib , include change gene expression acquire mutation tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive olaparib PO BID cediranib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
