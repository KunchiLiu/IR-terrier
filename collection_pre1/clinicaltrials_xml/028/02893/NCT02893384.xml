	<brief_summary>Pain follow mastectomy surgery breast cancer significant . Poorly manage pain immediate time-period follow surgery potentially lead long-term ( chronic ) pain condition . There still need find safe , least invasive , effective method manage pain . The investigator believe new technique inject local anesthesia ( freeze ) specific area end mastectomy surgery may important step manage pain breast surgery . The investigator would like begin perform pilot study , mean investigator perform technique patient compare pain outcomes patient technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mastectomy associate significant acute postoperative pain . It show inadequately manage post-mastectomy pain breast cancer patient detrimental physiological , psycho-behavioural , recovery healthcare utilization consequence . Most significantly , acute postoperative pain appear substantial risk factor progression chronic post-surgical pain ( CPSP ) , occur 68 % patient , , high severity acute pain link great progression CPSP . A multimodal analgesic approach optimal method reduce risk progression CPSP , number analgesic technique use reduce incidence acute postoperative pain . Of analgesic technique use , common multimodal systemic analgesia , thoracic paravertebral blockade , thoracic epidural analgesia , local anesthetic wound infiltration , recently pecs block serratus plane block . The former three technique associate drawback include technical challenge , high risk adverse effect , limited evidence minimize progression CPSP state , whilst local anesthetic wound infiltration highly variable pain outcome . Therefore , alternative , safer , effective technique would ideal . Local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) technique demonstrate efficacious joint surgery , whilst injection local anesthesia serratus plane target intercostal pectoral nerve may benefit mastectomy surgery . However , nobody yet perform LIA around nerve breast surgery , investigator feel enormous potential .</detailed_description>
