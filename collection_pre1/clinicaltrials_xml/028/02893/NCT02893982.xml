	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint protocol demonstrate feasibility optimize , image-guided pre-planned workflow deliver least 25 Gy periphery target lesion maintain establish dose constraint normal tissue , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) navigate percutaneous interstitial HDR brachytherapy liver lesion . Secondary endpoint include assessment toxicity oncologic outcome ( primarily local control treat site ) exploratory endpoint support advanced imaging study time treatment procedure . The 25 Gy start dose choose show effective control tumor , albeit limited followup . The promising outcome note dose predicate actually deliver dose , hence feasibility endpoint meeting goal dose delivery . While primary endpoint toxicity avoid exceed MTD , trial treat patient level good characterize toxicity efficacy within dose level ( therapeutic window ) . The investigator attempt escalate level model would predict durable local control approach 100 % .55 Dose escalation level 5 Gy chosen mirror study perform institution SBRT</detailed_description>
