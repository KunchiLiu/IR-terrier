	<detailed_description>Living donor ( LD ) kidney transplantation currently best treatment end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) term life expectancy quality life . This method allow preemptive transplantation , begin dialysis . The main objective study investigate quality life societal participation population LD kidney transplant recipient compare preemptive LD transplantation versus non-preemptive transplantation ( performed period dialysis ) . It hypothesize addition prolong graft survival , preemptive LD kidney transplantation associate less deterioration quality life well societal participation . We therefore propose cross-sectional population-based study include patient underwent LD kidney transplantation 2004 2009 seven active kidney transplantation center France . Cross-sectional survey conduct since 2004 biomedicine agency collaboration InVS order evaluate quality life among ESRD patient . The recent survey , QUAVIREIN , process include small number patient select random . We want broaden study population beyond QUAVIREIN sample order include entire population LD kidney transplant recipient . The study population thus include patient receive LD kidney transplant 2004 2009 give inform consent participate study functional transplant March 31 , 2012 . The seven transplantation center agree participate study . The patient identify use CRISTAL QUAVIREIN databases . Quality life , occupational rehabilitation societal participation data collect self-administered questionnaire send identified patient , except ( order avoid duplicate ) already participate QUAVIREIN survey . The methodology data collection QUAVIREIN . The Department Epidemiology Clinical Evaluation ( CIC-EC ) Nancy University Hospital Center charge study logistics organization . The study hypothesis test apply univariate multivariate statistical analysis collect data use ad hoc model compare preemptive transplantation versus non-preemptive transplantation .</detailed_description>
