	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , parallel , randomize ( 1:1 Slow Dose Titration Group ; Rapid Dose Titration Group ) , two-group study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics efficacy slow rapid dose titration regimens subcutaneous Remodulin infusion subject pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The study include 50 subject 10 clinical trial center China . The treatment phase study last approximately 16 week . Subjects complete require assessment also eligible enter long-term open-label , extension study ( CVT-CV-004 ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . The subject voluntarily give write informed consent participate study . 2 . The subject least 18 year age screening . 3 . The subject weigh minimum 40 kg body mass index le 40 kg/m2 screening . 4 . The subject diagnosis idiopathic heritable PAH , PAH associate repaired congenital systemictopulmonary shunt ( least one year since repair respect date providing informed consent ) , PAH associate connective tissue disease . 5 . The subject must baseline 6MWD 150 550 meter , inclusive , absence concurrent injury , illness ( PAH PAH related condition ) , confound factor would prevent accurate assessment subject 's exercise capacity . 6 . The subject either treatment naïve receive PDE5 inhibitor and/or ERA least 60 day prior screen stable dose least 30 day prior screen willing remain PDE5 inhibitor and/or ERA dose duration 16week treatment phase . 7 . The subject must optimally treated conventional pulmonary hypertension therapy ( e.g. , oral vasodilator , oxygen , digoxin , etc . ) addition , discontinuation , dose change least 14 day prior screen ( exclude diuretic anticoagulant dose adjustment ) . 8 . The subject undergone right heart catheterization screen period ( within 3 year screen ) document mean pulmonary artery pressure ( PAPm ) great equal 25 mmHg , pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ( PAWP ) less equal 15 mmHg , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) 3 Wood unit . 9 . The subject undergone echocardiography within 7 day prior randomisation evidence clinically normal leave systolic diastolic ventricular function , absence clinically significant leave sided heart disease ( e.g. , mitral valve stenosis ) absence unrepaired congenital heart disease . Subjects clinically insignificant leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction due effect right ventricular overload ( i.e. , right ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation ) exclude . 10 . The subject previous ventilation perfusion lung scan and/or high resolution computerize tomography scan chest and/or pulmonary angiography consistent diagnosis PAH ( e.g. , low probability pulmonary embolism ; absence major perfusion defect ) . 11 . The subject pulmonary function test do within 9 month prior screen period follow : 1 . Total lung capacity ( TLC ) least 60 % ( predict value ) 2 . Forced expiratory volume one second/forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) ratio least 50 % 12 . Sexually active woman childbearing potential must practice true abstinence intercourse line prefer usual lifestyle , use two different form highly effective contraception . Medically acceptable form effective contraception include : ( 1 ) approve hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill ) , ( 2 ) barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) use spermicide , ( 3 ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) , ( 4 ) partner vasectomy . For woman childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test require screen negative hCG urine pregnancy test require baseline visit . Women child bear potential include female experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea least 12 consecutive month ) . Males participate study must use condom length study , least 48 hour discontinue study medication . 13 . In opinion Principal Investigator , subject able communicate effectively study personnel , consider reliable , willing likely cooperative protocol requirement , include attend study visit , mentally physically capable learn administer Remodulin continuous SC infusion use micro infusion pump . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . The subject pregnant lactating . 2 . The subject receive epoprostenol , treprostinil , iloprost beraprost within 90 day prior screen ( except use acute vasoreactivity test ) . 3 . The subject previous intolerance lack efficacy prostacyclin prostacyclin analogue result discontinuation inability titrate therapy effectively . 4 . The subject disease associate PH idiopathic heritable PAH , PAH associate repair ( least one year ) congenital systemictopulmonary shunt connective tissue diseases atrial septostomy . 5 . The subject WHO functional class IV . 6 . The subject current diagnosis uncontrolled sleep apnea define physician . 7 . The subject liver function test ( AST ALT ) great three time upper limit laboratory reference range . 8 . The subject history active gastrointestinal ulcer , intracranial hemorrhage , injury cause clinically significant bleeding episode within 6 month screen , disease / condition would either jeopardize safety subject / interfere interpretation study assessment opinion Investigator . 9 . The subject history ischemic heart disease include previous myocardial infarction symptomatic coronary artery disease within 6 month screen , history leave sided myocardial disease evidence PAWP ( leave ventricular enddiastolic pressure ) great 15 mmHg leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less 40 % . 10 . The subject uncontrolled systemic hypertension evidence systolic blood pressure great 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great 100 mmHg . 11 . The subject systemic hypotension evidence systolic blood pressure le 85 mmHg 12 . The subject musculoskeletal disorder ( e.g. , arthritis affect low limb , recent hip knee joint replacement , artificial leg ) disease likely limit ambulation , connect machine portable . 13 . The subject unstable psychiatric condition mentally incapable understand objective , nature , consequence trial , condition Investigator 's opinion would constitute unacceptable risk subject 's safety . 14 . The subject receive investigational drug , investigational device place participate investigational drug device study within 30 day prior screen .</criteria>
