	<brief_summary>Dysregulation blood pressure ( BP ) , secondary decentralize autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) control cardiovascular system , often result chronic hypotension orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , particularly high cord lesion ( i.e. , T6 ) . While hypotensive individual chronic SCI remain asymptomatic complain symptom associate cerebral hypoperfusion , evidence reduce rest cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) report association low systemic BP SCI non-SCI population . Reduced CBF hypotensive individual may lead cognitive dysfunction , report significantly impaired memory marginally impaired attention process hypotensive individual SCI compare normotensive SCI cohort . Furthermore , find CBF increase cognitive testing individual SCI , may contribute impaired cognitive function compare non-SCI control . Although asymptomatic hypotension may adverse impact cognitive function quality quality life ( QOL ) clinical management condition extremely low . In fact , report nearly 40 % Veterans SCI hypotensive , less 1 % carried diagnosis hypotension prescribe anti-hypotensive medication . The discrepancy incidence treatment asymptomatic hypotension SCI population may relate paucity treatment option support rigorous clinical trial document safe effective use anti-hypotensive therapy BP , CBF cognitive function . We hypothesize study medication may increase systolic blood pressure normal range improve cerebral blood flow velocity . Results conclusion remove record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study 1 : Subjects visit laboratory 3 9 time 4 hour determine BP response dose 3 study medication ( midodrine , pyridostigmine , mirabegron ) . Upon arrival laboratory subject randomize receive midodrine , pyridostigmine , mirabegron . Subjects remain seated wheelchair duration test . Instrumentation apply study personnel subject seat quietly , take 20 minute . Instrumentation include placement 3 ECG electrode continuous HR monitoring finger brachial BP cuff . BP , BR HR record 5-minutes medication administration ( baseline ) . After baseline , small pill give glass water . BP , BR HR monitor 5-minutes every 30 minute 4 hour drug administration . Study 2 : Twenty visit laboratory 4 occasion determine effect three anti-hypotensive agent , compare placebo , BP , CBFv , cognitive performance select neuropsychological test . Upon arrival laboratory every visit subject randomize receive midodrine , pyridostigmine , mirabegron , match placebo . Neither study subject investigator know administer . Subjects remain seated wheelchair throughout duration study session closely monitor study personnel . Instrumentation include placement 3 ECG electrode continuous heart rate ( HR ) monitoring , finger brachial BP cuff , Doppler ultrasound probe position leave MCA continuous CBFv monitoring . Subjects remain quietly seat wheelchair 30-minutes instrumentation 5-minute record continuous HR , BP , CBFv ( baseline ) . Prior baseline data collection period , first battery cognitive test administer . The study medication administer subject along glass water approximately 30-minutes arrival laboratory . There 2 hour break period second cognitive battery begin .</detailed_description>
