	<brief_title>Sapanisertib Treating Patients With Metastatic Refractory Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate associate sapanisertib ( TAK-228 ) patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNETs ) . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) associate TAK-228 patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNETs ) . II . To measure safety tolerability TAK-228 patient advanced PNETs . III . To evaluate disease control rate associate TAK-228 patient advanced PNETs . IV . To measure duration response rate associate TAK-228 patient advanced PNETs . OUTLINE : Patients receive sapanisertib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
