	<brief_summary>The primary aim present study screen high-risk type 2 diabetes patient heart failure patient without history atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , ongoing oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) treatment , implanted device recent stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , silent AF . Moreover , aim establish prevalence two risk factor stroke patient heart failure diabetes mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) aim assess feasibility group undergo AF screening . Overall , aim study prevent stroke high-risk patient group identification silent ( asymptomatic ) atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silent Atrial Fibrillation - Screening High-risk Groups Atrial Fibrillation ( The Silence Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number screen patient respectively heart failure type 2 diabetes risk score ( Congestive Heart Failure , Hypertension , Aged 75 year old , Diabetes , Stroke / transient cerebral ischemia , Vascular disease , Aged 65 year old Sex category ( CHADSVASc ) ) two , number patient exclude due AF ongoing AF , number eligible patient include reason , , finally , number include patient list . Patients eligible screen supplied hand-held ECG-recorder develop Zenicor Medical Systems ( www.zenicor.com ) transmit recording 4 time daily ( morning , midday , even -at meal - bedtime ) case symptom , 14 day . The transmitted ECGs digitally store , analyze screen AF . All AF episode record day time arrhythmia register . Eligible patient give brief oral thorough write patient information study , offer appointment first meeting , happen Cardiological out-patient clinic Copenhagen University Hospital ( Hvidovre ) member project group . During first meeting , patient get information study possibility ask question . If patient want bring relative friend already meeting , arrange . If patient meet criteria interested participation he/she invite participation study . The patient get rest information material , i.e . write informed consent declaration , give period question consideration participation least three day . If patient want another visit information possibly participation relative friend , visit schedule , patient include visit , write informed consent declaration give project group member . Heart failure patient standardize echocardiography diabetes patient supplementary registration HbA1c , late blood glucose value . The late level creatinine creatinine clearance register patient ( DM2 congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ) . Every patient give Study identification ( ID ) number key file link number patient ID ; thus , dataset anonymized . All ECG 's analyzed use soft ware base algorithm developed order exclude normal recording ( sinus rhythm without irregularity ) . Patients newly detect AF refer local cardiology out-patient clinic present OAC clinic treatment accord establish guideline include OAC treatment . Here patient inform option OAC treatment , reason want offer , include risk develop cerebral ischemic stroke , precaution treatment risk connect OAC treatment . The treatment OAC part screen study .</detailed_description>
