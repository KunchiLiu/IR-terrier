	<detailed_description>The study cluster randomize control trial 16 Primary Care Networks ( PCN ) Alberta . Inclusion exclusion criterion occur cluster patient level . Site criterion design ensure implementation intervention possible contamination control sit minimize . Patient level criterion design include many patient Metabolic Syndrome identify risk cancer due diet physical activity behaviour possible , maximize generalizability , ensure patient recruit safely able follow CHANGE intervention . CHANGE intervention utilize novel approach embed expertise Dietitians ( RD ) Exercise Specialists ( ES ) patient 's Family Doctor ( FD ) support personalize nutrition exercise intervention patient Metabolic Syndrome identify risk cancer due diet physical activity behaviours feasible implement across diverse practice setting . There sufficient data support individual component lifestyle intervention ( diet exercise ) efficacious . Unfortunately , primary care currently limit capacity implement lifestyle intervention manage individual overweight obese . Family Doctors experience various barrier provide diet exercise counseling , include lack staff resource , limited time effective health promotion counsel limited specialized training . In order provide quality care patient Metabolic Syndrome identify risk cancer due diet physical activity behaviour , investigator need reduce barrier support Family Doctors health care professional skill time help patient change behaviours . Although access interdisciplinary team increase Alberta past year development Primary Care Networks , optimal composition team yet determine . There significant evidence support increase diet exercise professional within primary care team . Currently , Primary Care Networks make decision structure health care team networks . This recent development strong provincial organizational structure create unique time location conduct trial examine prevention activity health care team . Findings CHANGE Cancer Alberta Study inform Primary Care Network business plan support implementation CHANGE intervention broadly across Alberta .</detailed_description>

Patients identify risk cancer due diet physical activity behaviour : . Physical inactivity measure : i. le 150 minute moderate activity ( i.e. , brisk walking , bike rid , jog ) per week and/or strength train less 2 time weekly ] OR ii . high sedentary time ( &gt; 11 hour per day 1,2 ) AND b. Dietary behaviour risk measure : i. Diabetes risk score high high fast glucose Hgb A1c normal OR ii . Abnormal fast plasma lipid profile AND c. 10Year cardiovascular risk score &gt; 10 % . Cluster level : Exclusion criterion : Previous involvement CHANGE intervention . Patient Level : Exclusion criterion : These include : 1 . Edmonton Obesity Stage 0 , 3 , 4 ( 62 ) . • Stage 0 patient apparent obesityrelated risk factor , physical symptom , psychopathology , functional limitation and/or impairment well .
