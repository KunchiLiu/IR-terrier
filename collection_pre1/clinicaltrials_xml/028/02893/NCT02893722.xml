	<brief_title>A Randomized Double Blind Comparison Atosiban Patients With RIF Undergoing IVF Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale With rapid development technology reproductive medicine , vitro fertilization embryo transfer ( IVF-ET ) relate derivative become important mean treatment infertility . IVF-ET pregnancy rate increase initial 10 % current 50 % , repeat implantation failure ( RIF ) occur occasionally , become difficult perplex IVF-ET clinical practice . There uniform definition RIF present . Coughlan et al call woman 40 year old experience least 3 fresh frozen period fail transplant 4 4 high-quality embryo RIF 2014 [ 1 ] . At present , patient start reason screen inspection spontaneously transplantation fail transplant 2 high-quality embryo . But embryo implantation complex process , etiology RIF roughly sum embryo factor , uterine factor , genetic factor , immunological factor , symptomatic treatment accord different cause improve success rate re-transplantation system [ 2 ] . However , case , etiology RIF still explain [ 3 ] . In recent year , influence uterine contraction embryo implantation attract attention . Studies show matter 's natural menstrual cycle fertility cycle , moderate Uterine Contraction ( UC ) conducive embryo implantation , excessive strong UC negative impact embryo implantation , even embryos implanted fallopian tube , cervical vaginal , even discharge uterus [ 4-6 ] . The estrogen level excessively physiological state process ovulation induction IVF induce production ofoxytocin endometrial cell , indirectly lead synthesis release prostaglandin PGF2α , result increase uterine contraction frequency [ 7-9 ] . In 1998 , Fanchin et al . find frequency uterine contraction 30 % embryos transplantation patient higher 5 time /min , significantly correlate success rate low pregnancy [ 5 ] . The follow-up study confirm ultrasound show frequency endometrial contraction induce ovulation induction cycle IVF [ 10 ] 5-6 time natural cycle . Therefore , addition soft operation transplant process , reduction uterine excessive contraction drug may effective measure improve success rate IVF pregnancy . Atosiban antagonist mixed receptor pitressin VIA oxytocin , compete oxytocin receptor locate uterine muscle cell membrane , foetal membrane decidua oxytocin inhibit contraction uterus ; time , inhibits generation oxytocin induced uterine endometrial prostate element PGF2 α increase endometrial blood flow perfusion . Pierzynski et al first applied Atosiban field reproduction 2007 first time , make uterine contraction frequency RIF patient fail transplant seven time oocyte donation embryo transplant decrease significantly , successful become pregnant [ 11 ] . This report immediately cause reproductive scientist apply Atosiban clinical study vitro assist reproduction . For general population , still dispute whether use Atosiban embryo transplant [ 12-14 ] . The prospective randomized study He Ye et al show Atosiban significantly reduce oxytocin patient endometriosis serum concentration PGF2 α , reduce frequency uterine contraction improve implantation rate quality blastocyst freeze-thaw treatment clinical pregnancy rate [ 15 ] . In RIF population , retrospective study prospective cohort study show use low dos Atosiban IVF-ET increase implantation rate fresh thaw quality embryos clinical pregnancy rate [ 16-18 ] , may improve pregnancy outcome patient RIF . But study randomize placebo-controlled study , conclusion still verify . Atosiban currently safe effective tocolytic drug uncomplicated preterm patient , patient accelerate heartbeat , nausea , vomit , headache , dizziness , flushing , anxiety , tremor side effect occasionally . Randomized double blind control trial show side effect application Atosiban placebo maternal child similar , difference statistically significant [ 15 ] . Preclinical study n't find Atosiban toxicity human sperm motility embryo development rabbit [ 20 ] . It n't find literature report fetal congenital malformation associate application Atosiban . Therefore , therapeutic dose Atosiban able safely use embryo transfer . In summary , study intend carry prospective , randomize , double blind control study compare influence Atosiban placebo uterine contraction frequency , endometrial blood flow perfusion , oxytocin serum concentration PGF2α , embryo implantation rate clinical pregnancy rate RIF population fresh embryo transfer , clarify curative effect Atosiban treatment RIF provide evidence-based basis Atosiban application RIF population .</detailed_description>
