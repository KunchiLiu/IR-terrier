	<brief_title>Use Regional Anesthesia Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo hip arthroscopy hip impingement investigator 's institution often regional anesthesia ( nerve block ) prior procedure help prevent and/or reduce pain following procedure . The investigator interest determine benefit well potential adverse effect utilize regional anesthesia patient undergo hip arthroscopy impingement . To , plan enroll patient age 18-45 undergoing hip arthroscopy , randomize one two group one group receive regional anesthesia pre-operatively second control group , . The surgical procedure post-operative management group . Regional anesthesia prior orthopaedic procedure widely adopt many field orthopaedics . While generally consider safe excellent adjuvant pain control , study explore outcomes beyond pain control . In many center , use regional anesthesia hip arthroscopy reserve post-operative management pain . There multiple study indicate patient receive regional anesthesia ( fascia iliaca femoral nerve block ) significantly great improvement pain score even excellent alternative routine narcotic medication patient undergo hip arthroscopy . Other orthopaedic procedure , knee arthroscopy , utilize similar technique achieve post-operative pain control femoral-sciatic nerve block . There also study look utilization regional anesthesia via lumbar plexus block hip arthroscopy . One study find patient undergo hip arthroscopy high level preoperative psychological distress frequently utilized lumbar plexus block achieve adequate pain control . Other study find lumbar plexus block significantly improve pain PACU . While serious complication lumbar plexus block rare , minor complication fall , persistent paresthesia , unexpected admission occur . At institution , utilize lumbar plexus block regional anesthesia patient undergo hip arthroscopy . Rather , standard care anesthesiologist perform single shot fascia iliaca block use bupivacaine patient pre-operative hold bay . To investigative team 's knowledge , study compare difference pain control , well differences narcotic requirement PACU , duration stay PACU , report fall , unplanned admission and/or readmission , day start rehabilitation , patient satisfaction , Harris hip score nerve pain/paresthesias/numbness clinic follow patient undergone hip arthroscopy without regional . A good understanding pain functional outcome follow hip arthroscopy without regional anesthesia help provider well assess circumstance regional anesthesia beneficial detrimental patient 's post-operative course .</detailed_description>
