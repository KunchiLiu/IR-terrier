	<brief_summary>Background : Brain spinal cord tumor uncommon . But contribute substantially cancer death U.S. child adult . Little progress make treat brain tumor . Researchers want learn tumor study people . Objectives : To understand brain spinal cord tumor well uncover area research . Also , connect people tumor doctor help manage illness give new treatment option . Eligibility : People age 3 older diagnose tumor brain spinal cord . Design : Participants initial ( baseline ) visit . They medical history take undergo physical neurological exam . They blood test . They may scan ( image study ) nervous system . If participant urine cerebrospinal fluid collect regular care , researcher may save . Brain tumor tissue prior surgery may study . Genomic DNA test do sample . Results link participant medical and/or family history . The number study visit NIH depend wish participant local doctor . Participants take brain tumor survey computer . They take 6 separate section . Participants answer question general well-being . They answer question learn symptom depression anxiety . Physicians discuss test result participant . They recommend management treatment option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Specimen Banking People With Tumors Central Nervous System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : This protocol design meet unmet need neuro-oncology evaluate patient CNS tumor throughout disease course . The protocol evaluate patient tumor central nervous system ( CNS ) appear probable candidate future protocol entry , disease manifestation unique scientific interest , importance , and/or educational value , understudied tumor unknown unclear natural history . Patients know genetic syndrome high risk develop CNS cancer also evaluate . Objectives : - To evaluate patient tumors central nervous system ( CNS ) probable future candidate NCI Phase I II protocols - To follow patient tumor CNS representative important scientific and/or clinical principle - To follow patient CNS tumor understudy indeterminate natural history - To evaluate follow patient know genetic syndrome high risk develop CNS cancer Eligibility : - All patient great equal 18 year age tumor CNS ( history tumor CNS ) interest NOB , may candidate NOB trial point future . - Patients tumor CNS particular interest member NOB pose important clinical and/or scientific question and/or shed light important aspect disease . - Patients know genetic syndrome high risk develop CNS cancer eligible . - Patients rare tumor CNS offer important educational benefit neuro-oncology trainee staff . - Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Design : - All patient undergo initial evaluation Clinical Center member NOB past medical oncologic history obtain well relevant data neuroimaging pathology review . A total 10,000 patient accrue study . - Patients may see NIH Clinical Center vary interval depend clinical situation . Data related natural history disease course outcome collect least every visit NIH Clinical Center image review minimum every year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient great equal 18 year age tumor CNS ( history tumor CNS ) interest NOB may future candidate another NOB trial . This include patient undiagnosed image abnormality central nervous system ( brain and/or spinal cord ) . Patients know genetic syndrome high risk develop CNS Cancers eligible . Patients tumor CNS particular interest member NOB pose important clinical and/or scientific question and/or shed light important aspect disease . Patients rare tumor CNS ( define occur less 1,000 patients/year United States ) offer important educational benefit neurooncology trainees staff . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients see second opinion plan return NIH clinical evaluation care .</criteria>
