	<brief_summary>Increasing physical activity ( PA ) limit sedentary time important many aspect young child 's wellbeing . However , young child 's PA often limit , instead preschooler ( 3-5 year old ) spend large portion day inactive . Given 7 million U.S. child younger 5 attend center-based child care , early care education ( ECE ) set important source PA young child . Thus , PA promotion effort ECE program crucial increase activity level young child , although intervention exist limited success . Classroom teacher important gatekeeper physical activity ECE classroom , determine active child care . However , teacher often hesitate implement physical activity classroom . Teachers ' attitude PA , confidence modify child 's PA , physical ability influence amount activity provide interact child support PA. Few model exist enhance teacher ' skill promote child 's activity , although approach could result sustainable outcome . Innovative approach physical activity promotion need , engage teacher training , ongoing technical assistance , easy-to-use resource . This project aim improve child 's physical activity Move , Play , Learn ! intervention , intervention design alter behavior classroom teacher increase PA child ( 3-5 year old ) enrol ECE program novel , behavioral coaching approach . To evaluate 10-week intervention , 32 classroom ECE center recruit randomly assign Move , Play , Learn ! intervention waitlist control . Teachers intervention arm attend training workshop learn child 's activity increase use natural opportunity across child care day teacher engagement child impact activity outcome . Teachers ask modify typical classroom activity active , use strategy resource ( e.g. , how-to video , pocket activity card ) ask modify interaction child support PA. Goal setting , self-monitoring , tailored feedback facilitate behavior change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview The intervention program deliver randomize control study , half 32 participant Move , Play , Learn intervention immediately half receive intervention waitlist control format . Participants begin study first baseline survey 5 day accelerometry assess current physical activity practice within participate classroom . Then , participant randomize intervention arm , participant proceed intervention describe elsewhere . If randomize waitlist control , participant encourage continue normal classroom activity . At end intervention , teacher complete survey accelerometry baseline well participant satisfaction survey . This end teacher ' participation project . At baseline , parent ask provide demographic information participate child . Children ask wear accelerometer 5 day teacher baseline follow-up period . This data collection do school week ( Monday-Friday ) , child attend center-based case . Recruitment Recruitment effort target toward licensed child care center Orange , Chatham , Durham , Alamance , Wake , Guilford Counties . A list facility publicly available online database maintain North Carolina ( NC ) Division Child Development Early Education 's ( http : //ncchildcaresearch.dhhs.state.nc.us/search.asp ) . Study staff contact director child care center ask assistance distributing study flyer staff . Flyers instruct interested provider parent contact study office . Randomization Centers randomize two set , halfway baseline data collection half end baseline data collection . At randomization time point , Principal Investigator ( PI ) generate randomization table use permute block approach block size 2 ensure balance study arm give enrollment time point . The randomization table excel format include sequential number randomization assignment ( intervention control ) . The PI apply randomization table list center determine study arm assignment . The PI notify center assignment either intervention control arm . Centers intervention arm immediate access Move , Play , Learn ! Intervention control arm delay access program ; follow-up measure collect . Power Calculation Investigators compare change child physical activity use baseline post-intervention accelerometer measure among child classroom randomize Move , Play , Learn ! intervention compare child classroom randomize waitlist control group . The sample size ( n=26 ) sufficient measure modest increase physical activity ; although expect , measure activity level 7 child per center , investigator detect even 7 % increase ( approximately 12 minute per day ) non-sedentary physical activity , put effect size term measurable outcome . Based previous work similar study , investigator estimate 0.55 effect size Move , Play , Learn ! intervention . Because child cluster within ECE classroom , need account power calculation . Based previous study , ECE center intra-class coefficient ( ICC ) estimate 0.12 nonsedentary time . This ICC appropriate use power calculation since 1 classroom per center recruit ; thus center classroom interchangeable . It anticipate average 7 child per classroom recruit . Using two-sided test significance α=0.05 , ICC=0.12 , cluster size=7 child per classroom , sample size 13 center per arm ( 91 child per arm ) provide least 80 % power detect anticipate change physical activity ( effect size=0.55 . Accounting 15 % attrition classroom teacher , investigator recruit randomize 32 ECE classroom ( 16 per arm ) minimum 7 child per classroom total 224 child . Statistical Analysis The primary analysis test hypothesis intent-to-treat principle ( ITT ) use longitudinal , mixed effect model account correlation child physical activity ECE center . As show , model include random intercept ( b0 ) fix effect intervention ( B2 ) baseline ( B1 ) test mean change physical activity different two arm . Child PA10 wk = β0 + β1Child PAbaseline + β2Intervention + β3Center + b0 + e Additional analyse 1 ) adjust baseline covariates consider relevant change physical activity ; 2 ) adjust baseline variable distribute differently study arm ; 3 ) test interaction term treatment group covariates ; 4 ) examine completers . Missing data The study team make every effort minimize miss data ; however , miss data expect occur . Investigators examine potential bias non-ignorable , non-response use two method . First , investigator compare respondent non-respondents see systematic difference non-missing variable . Next , investigator assess type missingness , whether miss completely random ( MCAR ) miss random ( MAR ) miss random ( MNAR ) . If data either MAR MNAR investigator employ multiple imputation impute miss PA value . Sensitivity analysis conduct determine effect miss data intervention effect estimate robustness result use different estimation method .</detailed_description>
