	<brief_summary>Balance training important component physical fitness , however due mundane often repetitive nature balance training alone often forgotten result people may susceptible postural control instability . A potential solution mundane aspect balance training use exergaming ( interactive exercise gaming combine ) use commercial gaming system Nintendo Wii , Dance Dance Revolution ( DDR ) recently XBOX Kinect . The aim investigation ass XBOX Kinect versus traditional balance train postural control , flow technology acceptance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exergaming Versus Gym-based Exercise Postural Control , Flow Technology Acceptance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exergaming - exercise use interactive computer-generated environment - increasingly used physical rehabilitation . Benefits report range clinical population ( people neurological problem child cerebral palsy learn difficulty , Parkinson ' disease , multiple sclerosis old people . Balance train important focus rehabilitation . Previous literature regard effect exergaming method balance-training mainly conduct use Nintendo Wii™ Wii™ fit people must stand balance board play game . Although literature show traditional balance training alone effective improve balance range population , study compare exergaming `` traditional '' balance exercise ( SEBT , trampolines wobble board ) show mixed result exergaming traditional balance training group improve postural control outcomes great improvement exergaming group traditional balance exercise . A potential reason differentiation result could due different movement require `` traditional '' balance exercise rather something inherently different exercise virtual environment . There also dearth randomize control trial ( RCT ) area evidence base limit . Furthermore , study important psychological aspect exergaming , particular acceptance flow experience . The aim study assess effect exergaming use XBOX Kinect™ system , versus , traditional gym-based exercise , virtual stimulus ( TGB ) : ( 1 ) postural control , ( 2 ) technology acceptance ( 3 ) flow experience ( 4 ) exercise intensity young healthy adult . Matching intensity exercise , two group , assess objectively , Heart Rate subjectively Borg RPE exercise session . To knowledge first paper compare effect exergaming match traditional exercise movement pattern , intensity physiological demand match assessed across group .</detailed_description>
