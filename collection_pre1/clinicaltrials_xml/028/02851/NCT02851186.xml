Subjects group undergo standard operation procedure receive post-operative analgesic base usual care . Study instrument : A 10-point pain Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) employ primary outcome assessment . Intervention : Subjects treatment group receive EA combine AA within two hour operation , post-operation upon arrival ward day subsequent 5 day . Subjects control group receive non-invasive sham procedure schedule . Main outcome measure : Primary outcome : NRS pain score measure upon recovery , hourly 6 hour surgery , 4-hourly day 2 , 6-hourly day 3 daily discharge . Secondary outcome : Morphine consumption , post-operative syndrome , quality recovery questionnaire , SF-6D , EQ-5D-5L adverse event document compare group . Data analysis : Pain intensity first 5 day calculate Area Under Curve ( AUC ) NRS pain score . AUC two group compare Student 's T-test . Expected outcome : AUC acupuncture group expect significantly low sham acupuncture group .</brief_summary>
