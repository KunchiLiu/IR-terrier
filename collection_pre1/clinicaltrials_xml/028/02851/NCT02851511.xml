	<brief_summary>A randomized two-phase clinical trial enroll 360 participant age-related cognitive decline , Alzheimer 's disease neurodegenerative disease ( MoCA &gt; 25 ) . Cognitively healthy elderly adult undergo CT intervention education training-control ( TC ) condition combination transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) sham tDCS control . The CT intervention employ suite adaptive training task ( Double Decision - Useful Field View , Card Shark - Working Memory , Freeze Frame - Arousal-Alerting ) POSIT Science Brain HQ6 , well validate CT method enhance cognitive function elderly . TC involve exposure educational nature video relate content question interval duration CT , provide well-matched active control . Participants receive CT TC conjunction tDCS sham/placebo prefrontal stimulation administer training . Participants assess baseline , CT ( 12 week ) , 12-month follow-up . At time point , comprehensive neurocognitive , clinical multimodal neuroimaging assessment brain function , metabolic state , brain structure conduct . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ) use assess brain response work memory , attention memory encode . Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) assess cerebral metabolite gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) concentration . GABA concentration MRS provide sensitive marker neuro-plastic change task-associated brain region . Alzheimer 's disease risk factor ( APOE4 , familial history ) , baseline clinical/demographic characteristic ( e.g. , diabetes ) , neuroimaging biomarkers ( e.g. , white matter abnormality load ) ass factor predictive value individual response tDCS CT. Based power analysis intervention effect , 80 participant randomize four treatment condition phase 1 . Following intervention , CT ( n=40 ) TC ( n=40 ) condition compare . Interim analysis aim show CT previously establish strong effect cognitive outcome perform , thereby enable elimination TC condition . Phase 2 enroll remain 280 participant two CT intervention condition .</brief_summary>
