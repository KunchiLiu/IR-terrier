	<detailed_description>The EPIMAD Registry cover large area Northern France ( 9 million inhabitant ) collect incident CD case data CD multiplex family ( family 3 CD affect patient ) Nord Pas de Calais Somme Seine Maritime . If investigator could demonstrate CD case multiplex family relate high frequency NOD2 gene mutation , investigator find CD multiplex family without NOD2 gene involvement . Thus family high prevalence CD case may rely major genetic susceptibility variant ( ) remain determined . clinical research Whole Exome Sequencing protocol , aim highlight genetics mutation major effect CD initiate . This study familial genetic study intra-familial control . The genetics analysis : - Ascertain significant NOD2 mutation family member Sanger DNA sequence - WES ( CD patient family control unaffected subject ) - Genotyping mutation find , case control segregation analyse validate implication CD .</detailed_description>
