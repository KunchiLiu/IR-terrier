	<brief_summary>The diagnosis cutaneous lesion often involve use surgical invasive procedure biopsy excision order analyze structure appearance fabric pathologist . With recent advance optical electronic field , considerable effort produce build high-performance optical instrument , able transcribe internal structure skin vary degree depth variable resolution . The imagery area great interest medical diagnosis : non-invasive , quick , real time . This area boom new optical instrument create eventually able offer reliable alternative invasive technique . The optical property different tissue study several year different research group : coefficient light absorption tissue vivo vitro , coefficient light scatter index refractive characterize various tissue make skin . Other study focus melanoma detection multispectral optical technique , via technique optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) perform lesion suspicious cancer , without link criterion two technique . However , study date knowledge able demonstrate different optical parameter obtain OCT directly connect known histopathological parameter commonly use diagnosis lesion skin . This study aim verify possible determine parameter measure OCT would discriminate benign malignant lesion .</brief_summary>
