	<brief_title>Clinical Grade Adenovirus Specific T Cells Immunotherapy After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation ( CTL-ADV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT ) improve last decade . However , HSCT especially match unrelated , cord blood haploidentical donor , patient often experience deep immunodeficiency , increase susceptibility viral infection . Among , adenovirus ( ADV ) systemic infection , often refractory antiviral treatment , associate high mortality rate 50 % ( even child ) . Viremia monitoring HSCT contribute improve survival allow implementation pre-emptive anti-viral treatment appearance clinical sign ADV disease . Nevertheless , anti-viral drug authorize ADV infection , although intravenous ( IV ) cidofovir seem , , efficient . However , nephrotoxicity , especially tubular dysfunction , often describe , require hydratation uroprotection probenecid limit treatment period . Meanwhile , adoptive transfer ADV-specific T cell , prepare immunomagnetic clinical grade technology , become alternative treatment already prove feasible , safe helpful viral clearance immune reconstitution relate vivo expansion ADV-specific T cell lead clinical improvement ( Feuchtinger et al , 2006 , 2015 ; Qazim et al , 2013 ) . Our team propose multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial ADV-specific T cell 14 patient , refractory ADV infection disease unrelated Peripheral blood umbilical cord blood HSCT , include .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study Population : adult child Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell ( bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell , umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) ) sibling match unrelated donor 10/10 9/10 ( ( M ) MUD ) haploidentical donor case UCB transplantation Within 18 month HSCT , occurrence : An adenovirus infection without clinical symptom ( except fever unknown origin ) definitively due infection , treatment failure least 2 week Cidofovir ( 5 mg/kg/week ) . To determine ADV infection , 2 consecutive viremia perform 4 day interval must higher viral threshold 500 copies/mL ( significant increase 2 analysis least 0 , 5 log first viremia equal 500 cp/mL ) . Probable definitive adenovirus infection Cidofovir treatment failure , 5 mg/kg/week ( accord Wisconsin 's criterion ) and/or renal toxicity major intolerance antiviral drug and/or case Cidofovir available France Acute Chronic GVHD acute form grade II less , control 2 line treatment .
