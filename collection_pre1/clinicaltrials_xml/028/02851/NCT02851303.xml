	<brief_title>Morphine Versus Methadone Opiate Exposed Infants With Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates expose opiate utero develop constellation withdrawal symptom know neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . Infants NAS risk multiple medical complication include failure thrive seizure , often require prolonged hospital stay account significant health care cost . At University New Mexico , infant expose methadone heroin utero develop NAS require pharmacologic treatment undergo treatment wean methadone , whereas infant expose buprenorphine undergo wean morphine . However , morphine use frequently treat neonatal abstinence syndrome among methadone-exposed infant throughout US , optimal pharmacologic treatment NAS remain unknown . Anecdotal evidence investigator institution suggest infant treat morphine short hospital stay compare infant treat methadone . Investigators propose pilot randomize control trial evaluate morphine v methadone treatment infant in-utero methadone heroin exposure . Specifically , length treatment , need additional medication treat withdrawal , length hospital stay compare . When woman admit Labor Delivery and/or 12 hour postpartum , research staff approach patient study enrollment . Participants approach study enrollment medication list admission include methadone , participant self-report methadone use prenatally , and/ urine drug screen positive methadone opiates admission . If woman choose enroll study , infant require treatment NAS , infant randomize assign study number treatment use methadone morphine protocol time treatment require . All infant monitor sign withdrawal use standard UNM NAS score protocol . Standard care UNM treat infant expose opioids in-utero methadone require pharmacologic therapy NAS , therefore treatment withhold choose enroll study . Standard care also obtain urine drug screen infant report exposure opiate pregnancy . Enrolled patient thus undergo routine urine drug screening . The difference standard care regard study protocol treatment half methadone heroin expose infant morphine . The morphine protocol proven safety efficacy currently buprenorphine expose infant . Once randomize , infant continue protocol discharge . At discharge , parent complete patient satisfaction survey .</detailed_description>
