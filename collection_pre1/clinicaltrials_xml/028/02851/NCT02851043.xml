	<detailed_description>Firstly , ten healthy child participate trial evaluate pneuRIP . They fit band around abdomen chest . The pneuRIP connect band electrode . Breathing measure wirelessly iPad . They ask lie . They ask breath normally ask breath resistive element place mouth . The resistive element make difficult breath ( similar breathing straw ) . They breathe 3 minute condition record breathing pneuRIP Respitrace . These data compare . Secondly , A group 10 subject outpatient muscle clinic fit chest abdomen band . The Respitrace monitor pneuRIP record breathing pattern . Data two system compare .</detailed_description>
