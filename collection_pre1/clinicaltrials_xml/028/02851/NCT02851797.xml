	<brief_summary>randomise , double blind , parallel group , placebo control study . A total 213 male ambulant subject randomise 2:1 ( givinostat : placebo ) . Subjects stratify concomitant use steroid 4 stratum : 1 . Deflazacort daily regimen 2 . Deflazacort intermittent regimen 3 . Other steroids daily regimen 4 . Other steroids intermittent regimen .

	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Givinostat Ambulant Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Givinostat placebo oral suspension ( 10 mg/mL ) administer orally 2 oral dos daily subject fed state , accord child 's weight . Study drug permanently stop follow occur : - severe drug-related diarrhoea ; - drug-related Serious Adverse Event ; - QTcF &gt; 500 msec ; - platelet count ≤50 x 109/L . Study drug temporarily stop follow occur : - platelet count &lt; 75 x 109/L &gt; 50 x 109/L ( treatment temporarily stop platelet count perform re-tested platelet normalize ) ; - moderate severe diarrhoea . In case study drug temporarily stop , study drug resume level 1/3 small one Adverse Event lead temporary stop occur , platelet normalize diarrhoea mild ( treatment stop moderate severe diarrhoea ) . Two interim analysis plan conduct IDMC order ensure study integrity .</detailed_description>
