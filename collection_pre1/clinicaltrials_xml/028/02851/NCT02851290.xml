Common methods local anesthesia administration hypospadias surgery include caudal dorsal penile nerve block .

	<brief_title>Effect Caudal Penile Block Hypospadias Repair Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypospadias one common genitourinary ( GU ) malformation , see approximately 1 250 male live birth , characterize proximal location urethral meatus , dorsal hood foreskin incomplete ventral fusion , ventral curvature penis . Hypospadias repair include several standard step include urethroplasty , mobilization adjacent flap urethroplasty coverage , rotation penile skin flap circumcision . In order surgeon operate clean relatively bloodless field , tourniquet local epinephrine injection use . In rabbit hypospadias repair model , author use tourniquet local epinephrine infiltration maintain clear surgical field , show increase apoptotic urethral myocytes TUNNEL assay collagen deposition epinephrine cohort . The study also show structural change mitochondria scan electron microscopy epinephrine cohort . This hypospadias study demonstrate pathologic change urethra tourniquet epinephrine injection . While single stage hypospadias surgical technique standardize significantly two decade , surgical complication still occur 28 % patient . Complications include urethrocutaneous fistula , meatal stenosis , glans dehiscence , urethral stricture , urethral diverticulum . Risk factor hypospadias surgical complication extensively publish include : proximal urethral location , previous operation , glans width &lt; 14 mm , urethroplasty coverage layer , surgeon learn curve , age &lt; 4 year old . The majority hypospadias surgical complication need revise surgically result significant financial emotional burden family . The financial impact hypospadias visit , repair , reoperations society largely unknown . A single study 2000 note $ 16.6 million spent operative outpatient hypospadias care 17,000 total outpatient hypospadias visit make year . No recent study available cost patient per surgery per surgical complication repair also unknown . Multiple objective hypospadias surgical questionnaire develop characterize postoperative appearance skin , meatus , urinary stream , presence fistula . These study validate institution data correlate questionnaire score complication sparse . Penile sensation derive primarily dorsal nerve penis . Ventrally innervation frenulum derive perineal nerve branch . The dorsal nerve penis branch pudendal nerve supply sacral nerve . Common method penile block , perform hypospadias surgeon , include dorsal nerve penile block ( DNPB ) penile ring block . The DNPB involve infiltration local anesthetic use short bevel needle subpubic location 10 2 o'clock position dorsal nerve penis block enters base penis . The penile ring block perform infiltration local anesthetic subcutaneous tissue base penis . One prospective study show DNPB significantly well ring block . Success rate DNPB note anywhere 90-100 % child undergoing circumcision . Complications DNPB exceptionally rare &lt; 0.1 % include hematoma local tissue edema . Caudal block commonly perform regional block anesthesiologist hypospadias surgery . It involve blockade nerve pathway describe , proximal location , infiltration caudal epidural space sacral hiatus . The procedure perform usually lateral position . Anatomic landmark define equilateral triangle form bilateral posterior superior iliac spine , sacral hiatus . Initially short bevel needle small gauge angiocatheter insert sacral hiatus 45 degree angle `` pop '' heard , angle `` drop '' 0 degree needle advance . Aspiration perform absence cerebrospinal fluid blood , local anesthetic inject . Complications exceptionally rare rate &lt; 0.003 % include local anesthetic toxicity , neurological injury infection success rate 96 % report . Penile physiology blood flow parameter DNPB caudal block largely unknown . Very study show effect distal organ perfusion regional blockade . One study look child undergo caudal block urologic procedure find caudal block use 1.5 ml/kg 0.15 % ropivicaine increase dorsalis pedis arterial parameter : increase peak velocity 24 % , volume flow 76 % , arterial diameter 20 % . The author propose sympatholytic mechanism reason physiologic change . Another randomize control trial primarily look post-operative pain outcome hypospadias repair patient also find increase penile volume 27 % caudal block arm , propose mechanism also sympatholytic . Finally , case report sympatholytic effect caudal block use treat glans ischemia circumcision . Penile analgesia caudal block approximately equal DNPB . A meta-analysis circumcision analgesia literature , analyze 700 patient show analgesic equivalence caudal versus parenteral analgesia . Also meta-analysis , caudal block find equivalent DNPB increase motor blockade find caudal block arm . One randomize control trial assess analgesia requirement child undergo hypospadias repair caudal block penile block find penile block result superior pain control . However , another randomize control trial find caudal block result superior pain control compare penile block . After either bock , usually significant alteration mean arterial pressure . Recently , association caudal block hypospadias surgical complication theorize drawn international interest amongst pediatric urologists anesthesiologist . A randomized control trial 54 distal hypospadias repair patient , half assign caudal block half penile block , show urethrocutaneous fistula see caudal block arm . Even though primary outcome post-operative pain control group , author theorize caudal block lead sympathetic blockade , penile engorgement , tissue edema , increase hypospadias surgical complication . A nested case control series compare 45 fistula 90 control show association fistula caudal block . The author find fistula associate proximal urethral location , penile epinephrine injection , longer operative time . Unpublished data present 2015 American Urologic Association New Orleans Routh et al . show retrospective single surgeon series 452 primary hypospadias repair patient , half caudal block half penile block , caudal blockade highly associate hypospadias surgical complication even adjust operative time ( OR 3.9 ( 1.3-12.1 ) ) ; p= 0.0008 . This study date power appropriately assess association caudal block hypospadias complication . Thus , clinical equipoise regard utilization caudal block versus penile block post-operative pain control also minimize surgical complication hypospadias repair .</detailed_description>
