	<brief_title>Superior Bilioenteric Anastomosis Magnetic Compressive Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The superior bilioenteric anastomosis one common difficult operation Hepatobiliary Surgery . The traditional manual anastomosis become one main prognosis factor length suture time , difficulty operation , high incidence anastomotic leakage stricture . Magnetic compressive anastomosis realize fast anastomosis , reduce difficulty , reduce incidence anastomotic leakage stricture . Currently , majority study magnetic compressive bilioenteric anastomosis merely confine within clinical case report single-center , small sample , retrospective study , thus lack convictive evidence evidence-based medicine security , reliability convince . This study multicenter , prospective , randomize control trial . To evaluate security , reliability convince magnetic compressive superior bilioenteric anastomosis , study compare incidence anastomotic leakage stricture magnetic compressive anastomosis traditional manual anastomosis among patient need superior bilioenteric anastomosis operation . The study design plan enroll 70 patient divide Study Group ( Group A : Magnetic compressive anastomosis ) Control Group ( Group B : traditional manual anastomosis ) 1:1 ratio randomly stratification factor . The incidence anastomotic leakage stricture , length bilioenteric anastomosis time , value serum bilirubin , length discharge time magnetic device mean time hospital stay evaluate . The patient drop study adverse event happen , active request dropping , new-onset severe disease death . The primary secondary end point observe regular follow-up .</detailed_description>
