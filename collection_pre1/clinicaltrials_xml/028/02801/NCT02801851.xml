	<brief_summary>This study refine pilot test innovative , emergency department ( ED ) -based intervention delirium screening , initial management , communication inpatient provider , examine impact intervention rate documentation delirium electronic health record ED inpatient provider . To achieve , study develop pilot test intervention , Delirium Screening ( SCREEN-ED ) ED , involve 300 old patient ( 150 newly enrol intervention participant , 150 historical control ( comparison group ) currently collect ) , 4 key component : systematic screening delirium use Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) , inform provider screen result , checklist protocol initial delirium management base clinical guideline , documentation Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) communication inpatient provider delirium screen result . The study two primary aim . The first refine test feasibility acceptability SCREEN-ED intervention . The second examine impact SCREEN-ED rate delirium documentation secondary outcome ( length hospital stay , repeat ED visit hospitalization mortality 6-months ) 150 newly enrol intervention group compare 150 already collected historical control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator develop pilot test intervention , Delirium Screening ( SCREEN-ED ) ED , involve 300 old patient ( 150 newly enrol intervention participant , 150 historical control ( comparison group ) currently collect ) , 4 key component : systematic screening delirium use CAM , inform provider screen result , checklist protocol initial delirium management base clinical guideline , documentation Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) communication inpatient provider delirium screen result . The short-term goal test feasibility acceptability intervention , immediate impact documentation delirium EHR . The long-term goal utilize information glean developmental study inform large-scale multi-center randomize clinical trial test impact SCREEN-ED strategy clinical outcome include length stay , repeat ED visit , rehospitalization , mortality . The study enroll 150 patient intervention arm screen delirium use CAM . The screening result ( positive negative ) provide verbally EHR ED provider , , screen positive case , ED physicians provide checklist protocol delirium management embed ED EHR . Additionally , admit patient , screen result enter inpatient EHR . The study team review ED inpatient medical record compare physician documentation delirium SCREEN-ED compare historical comparison group currently collect . The study follow patient ( intervention comparison ) medical record review 6 month collect clinical outcome , examine secondary outcome . The study also examine acceptability intervention ED inpatient provider focus group prior roll-out SCREEN-ED refine intervention component year 2 study , intervention period complete , identify barrier facilitator intervention implementation . Using system use enroll historical comparison group , patient identify use real-time ED EHR ( PulseCheckâ„¢ ) , populate arrival detailed clinical information link hospital EHR . After initial eligibility screen , patient approach trained study staff introduce study . Informed consent obtain study staff use standardize Capacity Informed Consent Instrument combine capacity assessment question interviewer observation use prior ED delirium study . If patient fails Capacity assessment , proxy ask provide consent ( patient assent ) . The PIs work seamlessly integrate staff workflow ED . They expect enrollment last ~40 week , require 4 patient enrol per week meet sample size 150 intervention group ( recruitment rate &lt; 10 % , assume 200 patient per week 25 % ineligible 50 % refuse ) . The pilot SCREEN-ED intervention test whether screen delirium ED combine checklist protocol initial management feasible acceptable increase EHR documentation delirium . Consenting participant enrol SCREEN-ED administered brief ( &lt; 10 minute ) , standardized questionnaire train study staff member CAM score . Immediately follow interview , study staff member score CAM screen result ( positive negative ) , positive case , severity stage delirium ( mild , moderate , severe ) enter EHR verbally communicate provider . For patient screen positive , checklist protocol delirium management automatically appear EHR ED physician prompt review complete applicable checklist item . In case patient admit , diagnosis severity enter EHR admit physician directly inform exist structure verbal write communication ED admit provider . After intervention period , study team conduct additional focus group 10 provider ( MDs nurse ) , include representative inpatient service , provide qualitative data feasibility implementation intervention contribute systematic evaluation use REAIM ( reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation , maintenance ) framework . The investigator use widely use focus-group methodology design elicit range idea , attitude , experience reaction provider SCREEN-ED strategy . Semi-structured interview script develop generate discussion provider ' experience SCREEN-ED change management old patient result use . The checklist item provide overall structure focus group discussion . Information focus group , provide direct account provider experience , compliment adherence data collect medical record review . Inpatient provider describe checklist protocol ( e.g. , diagnosis , treatment &amp; communication ) impact care provide ( e.g. , Did anything differently know patient diagnose delirium ? Did result initial work-up contribute approach patient ? ) . It anticipate three focus group saturation reach ( i.e. , new idea contribute ) . However , case additional provider enrol conduct additional group saturation achieve . Participants enrol ongoing study delirium validate tool family member identify delirium CAM serve historical comparison group . This study , begin enrollment September 2013 , enrol 120 participant date enrol approximately 2 day week . The study enroll intervention patient soon possible completion comparison group enrollment minimize temporal separation enhance comparability . Participants comparison group screen delirium use CAM follow procedure describe intervention group . Because CAM use gold-standard compare new screen instrument administer screening purpose , CAM result communicate provider , incorporate EHR , provider give delirium management checklist . Medical record abstraction element intervention comparison group identical .</detailed_description>
