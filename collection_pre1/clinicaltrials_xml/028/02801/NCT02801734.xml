	<brief_summary>. Project Background Patients advance lung cancer high symptom burden low quality life . Early palliative care improve patient outcome newly diagnose advanced lung cancer patient , previously test model feasible widespread adoption . Hence , aim study pilot sustainable nurse-led intervention - Enhancing Quality life Patients ( EQUIP ) . ii . Hypothesis / Aim The aim study three-fold . Firstly , investigator aim determine feasibility acceptability EQUIP intervention . Secondly , investigator aim obtain tentative estimate efficacy EQUIP intervention . Thirdly , investigator aim determine data completion rate patient report outcome measure context EQUIP trial . iii . Methods Patients newly diagnose stage 3 stage 4 lung cancer recruit randomized EQUIP intervention usual care ( control ) group . Patients randomize EQUIP intervention group receive four face-to-face session palliative care nurse . The content educational session equip patient knowledge skill manage three common symptom fatigue , breathlessness anxiety . All participant complete Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Lung ( FACT-L ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) stigma subscale four time point : baseline , 4 , 8 12 week recruitment . Measures healthcare use also record . Additionally , participant intervention group complete feedback survey intervention session . A total sample 60 patient ( 30 arm ) recruit . Clinical Significance If successful , study lead large scale phase III trial test various component EQUIP intervention , order develop sustainable effective model provision palliative care advance lung cancer patient .</brief_summary>
