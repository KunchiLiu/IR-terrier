	<brief_title>Diltiazem Gel Versus Nitroglycerin Ointment Healing Process Scleroderma Digital Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Systemic sclerosis , also name scleroderma ( SSc ) , autoimmune connective tissue disease associate small vessel vasculopathy collagen deposition skin internal organ [ 1 , 2 ] . About 30-60 % patient limit diffused type scleroderma develop digital ulcer ( DUs ) course disease [ 3 ] . Depending sit ulcer , pathophysiology differ . The one distal part digit relate ischemic change base Raynaud phenomenon , intimal fibroproliferation , thrombosis ; , one bony prominence mostly due microtrauma follow poor vascularization heal [ 4 ] . These ulcer affect quality life patient mostly due pain difficulty heal [ 3 ] . Accordingly , several therapy introduce improve heal process . Among , nitroglycerin ointment assess effective topical agent Raynaud phenomenon ; however , find one study assess effect SSc digital ulcer , show non significant [ 5-7 ] . Calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) diltiazem also use Raynaud phenomenon scleroderma patient . Yet , potential side effect peripheral edema , hypotension , headache limit titration class drug [ 8 ] . Moreover , therapeutic effect SSc digital ulcer still questionable . Only , one clinical trial assess effect nifedipine ulcer healing , result non-significant difference compare placebo [ 7 ] . In addition systemic form CCBs , topical form diltiazem gel also available . Previous study introduce form diltiazem vasodilator , mostly , treatment chronic anal fissure [ 9 ] . Comparing effect topical nitrate chronic anal fissure show controversy . Some study result significant difference ; yet , study Ala et al , demonstrate diltiazem gel superiority nitroglycerin ointment [ 10 , 11 ] . Another survey , spite find non- significant difference two agent treatment anal fissure , give priority diltiazem gel headache induce nitroglycerin ointment [ 12 ] . As inferred previous study , medication use scleroderma DU heal drug apply Raynaud phenomenon . In spite determine therapeutic effect drug phenomenon , efficacy heal DUs still obscure . Furthermore , complication systemic therapy limitation dose titrating , topical agent prefer . However , still find effective topical therapy DU scleroderma patient . The effect topical diltiazem vasodilator agent treatment anal fissure bring mind idea may also effective heal scleroderma DUs . In addition , compare effect diltiazem gel topical nitrate anal fissure , generally , suggest preference former . However , find survey compare effect two topical vasodilator treatment DU . Thus , study , aim ass effect topical diltiazem SSc digital ulcer compare topical nitroglycerin . Material Method : A single blind case control study do 90 scleroderma patient register Tertiary Centers rheumatology disease Shiraz University Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran . ( The sample size estimate use formula n = ( Zα/2+Zβ ) 2 * ( p1 ( 1-p1 ) +p2 ( 1-p2 ) ) / ( p1-p2 ) 2 [ Zα/2 critical value Normal distribution α/2 ( confidence level 95 % , α 0.05 critical value 1.96 ) , Zβ critical value Normal distribution β ( power 80 % , β 0.2 critical value 0.84 ) p1 p2 expect sample proportion two group ] ) . Inclusion Criteria : The patient ' scleroderma diagnose base criterion LeRoy [ 13 ] . The one age 20-70 year old enter study . They , , least one active digital ulcer . Exclusion Criteria : The case comorbid diseases diabetes , thyroid disease cardiovascular disease exclude survey . Moreover , patient smoker , opium addict alcohol abuser also drop study . In addition , one receive inhaled oral prostanoid last 3 month , phosphodiesterase inhibitor except intermittent treatment erectile dysfunction last 1 month one receive antibiotic 2 week prior study , also , exclude . The baseline hepatic function test assess case moderate severe hepatic impairment increase aminotransferase level 3 also exclude survey . The study design : The patient divide 3 group ; one control group consist 30 case , two experimental group 30 patient . The control one ( C ) receive Vaseline ointment placebo , experimental group 1 ( E1 ) receive diltiazem gel ( 2 % ) apply DUs two time daily experimental group 2 ( E2 ) treat nitroglycerin ointment ( 2 % ) apply two time daily 8 week . The number DUs mean diameter DUs measure 3 group begin end study . Moreover , site ulcer ( fingertip , proximal interphalangeal joint ( PIP ) , distal interphalangeal joint ( DIP ) , metacarpophalangeal joint ( MCP ) ) also take account submit patient . The number new DUs develop study difference mean diameter compare 3 group . In addition , difference mean DUs different site also compare see site responsiveness topical therapeutic agent use survey . Ethical Issues : Informed consent entire protocol well form compatible Helsinki Declaration obtain patient . Ultimately , one agree enroll recruit study . Statistical Analysis : Data enter SPSS 19 . For compare number mean difference digital ulcer ' diameter 3 group different site ulcer , one-way ANOVA apply . In addition , Bonferroni test post hoc ANOVA apply pairwise comparison group . The significant p-value study consider &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
