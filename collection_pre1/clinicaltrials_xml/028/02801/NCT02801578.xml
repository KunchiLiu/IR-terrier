	<brief_summary>Ibrutinib currently FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . However , researcher think approve dose may unnecessarily high . The goal clinical research study compare 3 different daily dos ibrutinib learn dos affect disease body . Researchers think low dose ibrutinib find effective currently approve dose may help low risk side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Different Doses Ibrutinib Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , take ibrutinib capsule mouth every day 3 cycle . Each dose ibrutinib take time , either without food . During Cycle 1 , receive high dose ibrutinib ( dose currently FDA approve ) . You take 3 capsule day Cycle 1 . During Cycle 2 , receive second-highest dose take 2 capsule day . During Cycle 3 , take low dose ibrutinib take 1 capsule day . You must swallow ibrutinib capsule whole without opening , break , chew . You give study drug diary keep track dose ibrutinib take , include time dose take , miss vomited dos reason miss dose , dose vomit . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 28 cycle blood ( 1-2 tablespoon total ) drawn dose ibrutinib 4 24 hour dose pharmacodynamic ( PD ) pharmacokinetic ( PK ) testing , help researcher understand ibrutinib work body , learn dose take effective dos ( Exception : 4-hour blood draw day 28 ) . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . You need return clinic follow day ( Days 2 , 9 29 cycle [ Day 1 next cycle ] ) last blood draw . On Day 28 cycle : - You physical exam - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG . Length Study : You may receive ibrutinib study 3 cycle . After time , continue treatment CLL direct doctor . This may may include ibrutinib . If continue take ibrutinib study , doctor determine best dose taking . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study last dose ibrutinib ( end Cycle 3 ) . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . It consider investigational compare 3 different dos ibrutinib . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 12 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
