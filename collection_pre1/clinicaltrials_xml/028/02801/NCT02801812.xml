	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate role nailfold capillaroscopy assessment patient Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) . Primary endpoint : - To compare frequency major capillaroscopic abnormality patient SLE healthy control . Secondary endpoint : - To compare frequency major capillaroscopic abnormality patient active non-active SLE / active SLE healthy control / non-active SLE healthy control . - To study association different capillaroscopic parameter status subject ( SLE / active SLE / non-active SLE / healthy control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Multicenter Case-control Study Assess Nailfold Capillary Abnormalities Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Nailfold capillaroscopy ( NC ) diagnostic investigation use routine clinical set differential diagnosis connective tissue disease , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) . Among SLE clinical manifestation , vascular involvement common feature variable prevalence NC abnormality report SLE : typical NC change , well non-specific variation observe healthy subject . At moment literature intersperse different description capillaroscopic feature SLE , clearly define role NC SLE patient . It suggest presence major capillary abnormality may reflect microvascular systemic involvement SLE , may correlate disease activity . Against background , EULAR study group microcirculation rheumatic disease plan international multicenter study . Objective : To investigate role NC abnormalities assessment SLE patient . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : -To compare frequency major capillary abnormality patient SLE healthy control . Secondary endpoint : - To compare frequency major capillary abnormality patient active non-active SLE / active SLE healthy control / non-active SLE healthy control . - To study association different capillary parameter status subject ( SLE / active SLE / non-active SLE / healthy control ) . No . subject : Total enter : 364 ; Cases ( SLE ) : 182 ; Controls : 182 . Variables NC assessment : presence major capillary abnormality ; NC parameters/mm : number capillary , presence hairpin , tortuous , cross , bushy , ramify , enlarge , giant capillary , microhemorrhages , architecture disorganization , visibility subpapillary venular plexus ; presence scleroderma pattern , normal pattern . Clinical assessment : subject : date birth , gender , race . SLE : age disease onset , disease activity ( SLEDAI-2000 ) damage index ( SLICC-DI ) , presence antinuclear antibody , anti-dsDNA , anti-Extractable Nuclear Antigen antibody , lupus anticoagulant , anticardiolipin/beta2glycoprotein I antibody , Raynaud 's phenomenon , Hypertension , active smoke , diabetes mellitus , ongoing cumulative dose steroid treatment , ongoing immunomodulatory/suppressive treatment . Statistical method For primary endpoint similar secondary endpoint , McNemar test ( match design ) conditional odds ratio ( OR ) . For secondary endpoint , Fisher 's exact test OR , conditional logistic regression model ( match design ) non-conditional regression model OR appropriate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At time enrollment subject must 18 year older give write consent . Patients SLE must fulfill 2012 SLICC classification criterion . SLE onset must 16 year age . Patients SLE secondary antiphospholipid syndrome also enrol . Healthy control select accord definition propose protocol Subject refuse sign and/or he/she able understand patient inform consent . Subjects periungual traumatic lesion may create artifact ( i.e . recent manicure , onychophagia , garden ) . SLE overlap rheumatic disease Systemic Sclerosis , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Mixed Connective Tissue Disease , Sj√∂gren 's Syndrome , Dermatomyositis , Polymyositis</criteria>
