	<brief_summary>Fracture femur common result severe pain . Many method regional peripheral analgesia describe treat pain . In study investigator consider use paravertebral block treat post-fracture pain . Additionally , consider add dexmedetomidine use local anesthetic solution prolong duration block hence postoperative analgesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Dexmedetomidine Bupivacaine Paravertebral Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fracture femur common injury associate excruciate pain . This pain one important cause postoperative morbidity mortality insufficiently treat pain . Pain induces neuroendocrine stress response cause problem like reduction vital capacity , pneumonia , tachycardia , hypertension , myocardial ischemia even infarction . These problem prevent successful management postoperative pain . In patient proximal femoral fracture , use paravertebral blockade produce reliable level analgesia without need additional nursing skill monitor postoperative period . Paravertebral blockade injection local anesthetic solution alongside vertebral column produce ipsilateral analgesia . Currently available local anesthetic bupivacaine may provide reliable period analgesia result block resolution period worst postoperative pain . The use large volume local anesthetic one method overcome problem may lengthen duration analgesia increase risk local anesthetic toxicity . Adding adjuvant another potential alternative . Dexmedetomidine , selective Î± 2 agonist , use prolong duration analgesia nerve block . Dexmedetomidine also report enhance central peripheral nerve blockade . Alpha adrenoceptors locate nerve ending possible role analgesic mechanism prevent norepinephrine release . The spinal mechanism principle mechanism analgesic action dexmedetomidine .</detailed_description>
