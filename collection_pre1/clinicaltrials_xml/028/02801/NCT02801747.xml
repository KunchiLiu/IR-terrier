	<brief_summary>The present study target large population person live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) U.S. insufficiently engage HIV primary care take antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , mainly African American/Black Latino . NIH emphasize urgent need new research approach advance intervention science , propose project employ new , potent , innovative research methodology , Multiphase Optimization STrategy ( MOST ) , framework develop highly efficacious , efficient , scalable , cost-effective intervention . The propose study high public health significance : address vulnerable population PLHA , include critically important subpopulation men sex men ( MSM ) substance user ; develop efficient cost effective intervention increase engagement along HIV care continuum vulnerable group ; address two area highlight August 2015 notice research priorities NIH Office AIDS Research ( NOT-OD-15-137 ) , namely , engage PLHA prevention/treatment service , reduce HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More half person live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) U.S. insufficiently engage HIV primary care take antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , mainly African Americans Latinos . In proposed project , two experience productive behavioral scientist employ potent innovative research methodology , Multiphase Optimization STrategy ( MOST ) , develop highly efficacious , efficient , scalable , cost-effective intervention increase engagement along HIV care continuum . Whereas randomize control trial ( RCTs ) valuable evaluate efficacy multi-component intervention package , design evaluate specific component contribute efficacy . MOST , pioneer , engineering-inspired framework , address problem highly efficient randomize experimentation ass performance individual intervention component interaction . The investigator propose use MOST engineer intervention increase engagement along HIV care continuum African American Latino PLHA well engage care take ART . Further , intervention optimize cost-effectiveness . This efficiency cost-effectiveness critical time constrained resource , also increase intervention 's future scalability . NIH signal interest MOST , first study apply field adult HIV treatment . A similar set multi-level factor impede HIV care ART initiation African American Latino PLHA , primary among individual ( e.g. , substance use , distrust , fear ) , social ( e.g. , stigma ) , structural-level barrier ( e.g. , difficulty access ancillary service ) . Guided multi-level social cognitive theory , study evaluate 5 distinct intervention component ( i.e. , Motivational Interviewing session , pre-adherence preparation , support group , peer mentorship , patient navigation ) , design address specific barrier HIV care ART initiation . These component well-grounded empirical literature find acceptable , feasible , promising respect efficacy preliminary study . Study aim : 1 ) use highly efficient experimental design , identify 5 component contribute meaningfully improvement viral suppression , secondary outcome ART adherence engagement HIV primary care ; 2 ) identify mediator moderator component efficacy ; 3 ) use mathematical modeling approach , build cost-effective efficient intervention package efficacious component . A heterogeneous sample African American Latino PLHA ( respect age , substance use , sexual minority status ) recruit proven hybrid sample method use targeted sample community setting peer recruitment ( N=512 ) . This highly innovative significant study , address high-priority research area ( NIH NOT-OD-15-137 ) , produce HIV care continuum intervention nation 's vulnerable PLHA , optimize cost-effectiveness , exceptional level efficacy , efficiency , scalability .</detailed_description>
