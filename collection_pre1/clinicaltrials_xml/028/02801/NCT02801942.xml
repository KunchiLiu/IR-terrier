	<brief_summary>It hypothesize early change immune system New Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( NOT1D ) subject detect immune cell inguinal lymph node ( iLN ) , distinct change observe peripheral blood derive immune cell . Therefore study ass compare molecular immune profile cell derive iLN healthy NOT1D subject , understand immunological process may lead beta cell destruction . It multi-center , non-drug treatment study . Up 15 subject group , namely healthy subject NOT1D subject , evaluate study . A data look carry recruitment cohort 5 healthy subject , determine quality quantity cell derive aspirate core biopsy peripheral blood likely sufficient continue study meet primary objective .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 40 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Healthy subject determine investigator medically qualify designee base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination laboratory test Subjects consider healthy value follow parameter : fast glucose , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , International normalize ratio ( INR ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , platelet count , red blood cell total lymphocyte count within normal range screening . NOT1D subject document diagnosis diabetes mellitus accord American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) World Health Organisation ( WHO ) criteria consistent Type 1a ( autoimmune ) Diabetes Mellitus , interval 6 week initial diagnosis day 1 study ( Day 1 = `` iLN biopsy '' day ) NOT1D subject , currently require insulin treatment type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) receive insulin therapy least 7 day prior screen NOT1D subject positive , screen , least one autoantibody associate T1D : anti Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase ( GAD ) , antiIslet antigen 2 ( IA2 ) , anti islet cell antibody ( ICA ) , antiIndole 3 acetic acid ( IAA ) , anti Zinc transporter 8 ( ZnT8 ) . NOT1D subject evidence , screening , residual functioning beta cell measure fasted Cpeptide level &gt; =0.15 nanomole per liter ( nmol/L ) NOT1D subject value follow parameter : INR , APTT , platelet count , red blood cell total lymphocyte count within normal range screening . Both , male female subject eligible participate study . A female subject eligible participate pregnant [ confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ] , lactate screening AND study visit ( ) document evidence child bear potential . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance study requirement study restriction . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator , consultation Medical Monitor require , agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Healthy subject family history T1D ( , first degree relative diagnose T1D ) Healthy subject presence one serum autoantibody , antiGAD , antiIA2 , antiICA , antiIAA , antiZnT8 , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , antitissue transglutaminase antibody antinuclear antibody . NOT1D subject history autoimmune disease T1D NOT1D subject presence one serum autoantibodies follow : antithyroid peroxidase antibody , antitissue transglutaminase antibody antinuclear antibody Allergy intolerance local anaesthetic agent Any localised groin condition would contraindicate biopsy procedure include limited : Active infection/inflammation intend puncture site , previous surgery/scarring anatomical abnormality deem relevant procedure investigator , consultation Medical Monitor require . History bleed disorder , current anticipate continuous use anticoagulant ( include limit warfarin , rivaroxaban ) antiplatelet agent ( include limit Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , clopidogrel , etc . ) Active unresolved bacterial infection , viral infection , fungal infection within 4 week prior day 1 . Known febrile episode 38 degree celsius within 4 week prior day 1 . Active organ dysfunction previous organ allograft . History malignancy ( exception resect basal carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . Has undergone major surgical procedure within 30 day screen , and/or plan undergo surgery period study ( i.e . screen last followup telephone call ) Present previous treatment cell deplete therapy immunemodulating suppressive agent ( e.g. , oral steroid ) , include investigational agent follow limited e.g. , Interleukin ( IL ) 2 , alemtuzumab , anti Cluster Differentiation ( CD ) 4 , antiCD5 , antiCD3 , antiCD19 , antiCD20 . Vaccination = &lt; 28days day 1 study plan study period ( i.e . screen visit last telephone call ) Current participation interventional clinical trial . Subjects , participate interventional clinical trial previously , must wait 3 month complete previous interventional clinical trial participate study . Any medical history clinically relevant abnormality deem investigator and/or medical monitor make subject ineligible inclusion safety concern situation , investigator 's judgment , likely cause subject unable unwilling participate study procedure complete schedule assessment . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen ( unless positive due prescription medication ) . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids benzodiazepine . Inability access groin area perform biopsy procedure judge investigator .</criteria>
