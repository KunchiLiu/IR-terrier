	<brief_summary>Given : 1 ) various clinical complication may arise misdiagnosed scaphoid fracture ; 2 ) clinical radiographic diagnosis scaphoid fracture often challenging , particularly time presentation , study aim evaluate whether use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) investigation patient present suspected scaphoid fracture , negative finding initial conventional radiography ( 4-view plain x-ray ) , lead improved level efficiency , quality care patient experience . This study single centre randomise , non-blinded , prospective study . Participants randomise , follow initial negative conventional radiography , either : imaging A &amp; E ( consistent current clinical practice ) ; 2 ) wrist MRI . The study consider follow-up period 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use MRI Assessment Suspected Scaphoid Fracture With Negative Findings Initial Plain Radiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scaphoid bone obliquely orientate bone radial ( thumb ) side wrist , distal carpal row radius . Wrist injury common presentation Emergency Department ( ED ) UK . Amongst patient , scaphoid commonly fracture carpal bone , account 51-90 % carpal fracture 2-7 % fracture . Given : 1 ) various clinical complication may arise misdiagnosed scaphoid fracture ; 2 ) clinical radiographic diagnosis scaphoid fracture often challenging , particularly time presentation , study aim evaluate whether use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) investigation patient present suspected scaphoid fracture , negative finding initial conventional radiography ( 4-view plain x-ray ) , lead improved level efficiency , quality care patient experience .
