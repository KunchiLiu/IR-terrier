	<detailed_description>Introduction The diaphragm dome-shaped sheet muscle tendon serve main muscle respiration play vital role breathe process . Also know thoracic diaphragm , represent important anatomical landmark separate chest , abdomen . Indeed , diaphragm muscle extend trigeminal system pelvic floor , pass thoracic diaphragm floor mouth . Apart anatomy related anatomical connection , abdominal diaphragm prove develop many pivotal relationship : neurologic , vascular lymphatic , fascial connection The complex anatomic bio-mechanic structure thoracic diaphragm , well widespread influence interaction contiguous distant area human body , provide robust rationale osteopathic manipulative approach . Traditional osteopathy , presented Canadian College Osteopathy , define : `` A natural medicine aim restore function body treat cause pain imbalance . To achieve goal Osteopathic Manual Practitioner rely quality finesse his/her palpation work position , mobility quality tissue . '' A wide number osteopathic technique focus diaphragm propose , although systematically efficiently use , general lack evidence able clarify extent osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) diaphragm effective determines modification muscle contractility motion well objective determination benefit patient receive treatment . In recent study da Silva colleague compare manometry pressure low esophageal sphincter immediately osteopathic intervention diaphragm subject gastroesophageal reflux found positive increase pressure soon osteopathic treatment ; however , estimation impact OMT diaphragmatic activity indirect provide information change motility contractility ; another large double-blinded , randomize , control trial , four hundred six hospitalized subject pneumonia randomize receive conventional care , light touch treatment OMT , include doming technique diaphragm , adjunction conventional treatment pneumonia . Authors find significantly short length stay OMT light touch group v control , , able provide causal relationship OMT diaphragmatic activity . Finally , effect OMT COPD patient investigate contrast result : study 35 subject OMT protocol consist seven standardized osteopathic manipulative technique include indirect myofascial re-doming diaphragm compare sham therapy . Interestingly , result suggest overall worsen air trap 30 minute immediately follow one multi - technique OMT session relative sham group . Under indirect point view , result favor role OMT diaphragm mobility reactivation , since may relate dynamic hyperinflation-like mechanism promote air trap . On side another study demonstrate improved lung function severely obstructed subject COPD follow OMT . Thanks new hand-held ultrasound instrument , morphology function diaphragm assess different setting , outpatient clinic , pulmonary function test laboratory , hospital department intensive care unit , different condition . Ultrasonography non-invasive , non-ionizing imaging technique widely available directly assess diaphragmatic function . Two different sonographic approach permit assessment muscle thicken zone apposition excursion dome diaphragm . This study therefore aim investigate whether , extent , , single session select osteopathic diaphragmatic technique able affect muscle motility thickness , assess ultrasound , sample healthy subject compare result versus group receive sham therapy another one non-treated subject . Materials Methods : A prospective , randomize , double blind case v sham v control design study conduct . Seventy-one healthy volunteer select obtain write informed consent . A comprehensive clinical history obtain order identify active relevant condition include exclusion criterion list . The remain participant randomize three arm ( experimental , sham therapy control ) . The choice recruit healthy volunteer orient current lack clear objective evidence impact osteopathic technique thoraco-abdominal diaphragm . Therefore , since aware potential influence osteopathic treatment diaphragmatic motion function , judge identification diseased population suitable treatment arbitrary choice exclude subject know , prove , likely diaphragmatic dysfunction . Study design : participant , regardless assign group , receive comprehensive ultrasonographic evaluation diaphragmatic motion thickness ( see ) follow systematic osteopathic evaluation diaphragm . Following , subject underwent differential intervention accord belong study group : control group simply observe lie operator 's table without receive treatment , shame therapy group receive light touch approach ( gently pressure chest subcostal area without therapeutic purpose ) experimental group effectively treat . After , new osteopathic evaluation , follow repeat ultrasonography , perform subject . Noteworthy , study provide double blind design , patient ultrasonographist , unaware randomization group . Furthermore , osteopath operator access ultrasounds measurement wo n't influence . Osteopathic evaluation The technique use osteopathically assess diaphragmatic function discuss detail elsewhere . Ultrasound Evaluation Three consecutive M-mode Bi-mode measurement right diaphragm motion systematically obtain . A subcostal scan use convex probe frequency 2.5 3.5 mHz achieve subject 's deep inspiration ( inspiratory reserve capacity ) , start functional residual capacity , accord described protocol . After , three estimation diaphragmatic strength measure diaphragm thickness end inspiration end-expiration obtain longitudinal scan use linear probe 12 mHz frequency . The high three obtain value finally collect . Data Analysis Pre post osteopathic treatment ultrasound evaluation compare order detect statistically significant difference motion thickness . Secondary aim find whether clinical , demography lifestyle factor may predictors response treatment . Finally , correlation manual osteopathic assessment ultrasound measurement search .</detailed_description>
