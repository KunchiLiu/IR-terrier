	<brief_summary>This phase 1 open-label trial evaluate safety , pharmacodynamics clinical activity RRx-001 administer combination irinotecan . RRx-001 associated resensitization irinotecan tumor previously refractory . This effect attribute ability RRx-001 restore expression aberrantly silence gene , thus re-establishing pathway function . However , resensitization may one mechanism , among Pgp pump inhibition vascular modulation , lead improve penetration standard chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
