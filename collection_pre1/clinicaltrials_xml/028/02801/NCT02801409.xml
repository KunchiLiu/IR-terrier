	<brief_summary>Some study suggest regional anesthesia/analgesia may decrease rate recurrence/metastasis patient cancer surgery . However , evidence prospective study still lack . The purpose randomize control trial investigate effect epidural anesthesia/analgesia rate recurrence/metastasis patient undergoing lung cancer surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidural Anesthesia/Analgesia Outcome Patients After Lung Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer rapidly increase primary cause cancer death . Surgical resection first line treatment lung cancer . However , unavoidable tumor cell disseminate blood lymphatic system surgery . The outcome depend balance tumor-promoting factor immune function body perioperative period . Studies show stress response induce surgery inhibits cell-mediated immunity . In addition , anesthesia management perioperative period affect immune function patient ; example , volatile anesthetic opioids might aggravate immunosuppression potentially worsen long-term outcome , whereas regional anesthesia might attenuate immunosuppression exert protective effect . However , exist evidence insufficient draw conclusion topic . The investigator hypothesize regional anesthesia might improve long-term outcome patient lung cancer surgery , possibly preserve postoperative immune function . The purpose randomize control trial investigate effect epidural anesthesia/analgesia rate recurrence/metastasis patient undergoing lung cancer surgery .</detailed_description>
