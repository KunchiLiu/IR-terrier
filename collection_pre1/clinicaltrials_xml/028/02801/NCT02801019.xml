	<brief_title>Vitamin E-Diffused Highly Cross-Linked Polyethylene Liner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First generation modern highly cross-linked polyethylene ( XLPE ) clinically introduced 1998 country become standard bearing surface total hip arthroplasty . Studies material show significantly reduce femoral head penetration compare gamma sterilize conventional polyethylene . Thermaly treat ( melt anneal ) often part manufacture process highly cross-linked polyethylene . The polyethylene expose irradiation achieve cross-linking improve wear resistance . Cross-linking irradiation increase amount free radical material.These radical must eliminate stabilized avoid oxidative degradation time.Thermal treatment improve oxidation resistance potentially change mechanical property polyethylene . By anneal i.e . heat treatment melt temperature material maintain well mechanical property , elimination free radical suboptimal , lead oxidation vivo.Heat treatment polyethylene melt temperature effectively reduce eliminate amount residual free radical . This increase oxidation resistance , negatively influence mechanical property material . Due limitation new generation cross-linked polyethylene material develop . Introducing Vitamin E ( α-tocopherol ) , natural antioxidant material prevents oxidative degradation stabilize free radical find irradiated polyethylene plastic . In laboratory test , polyethylene liner incorporate vitamin-E demonstrated similar wear , great strength well resistance oxidation compare first generation cross-linked polyethylene . Currently , laboratory study vitamin E diffuse polyethylene available . The hypothesis study early-term E-XLPE wear low comparable heat-treated XLPE . The investigator also hypothesize implant fixation clinical outcome two year unaffected choice polyethylene . The investigator therefore evaluate early bedding wear uncemented arthroplasty supply liner make vitamin E diffusion dope XLPE ( E1® , Biomet , Warsaw , IN , USA ) . In control group investigator use uncemented hip prosthesis polyethylene liner manufacture achieve high level crosslinking without sacrifice mechanical strength extinguish residual free radical ( ArComXL® , Biomet , Warzaw , IN , USA ) .</detailed_description>
