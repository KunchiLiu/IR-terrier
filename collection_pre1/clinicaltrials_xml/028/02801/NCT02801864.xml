	<brief_title>tDCS Adjuvant Intensive Speech Therapy Chronic Post Stroke Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study client enrol Austin Speech Labs intensive speech therapy follow enrollment protocol . A total six participant enrol , randomly assign sham real group . Three client receive real receive sham tDCS . Prior receive tDCS speech therapy , participant ' comprehension assess use Western Aphasia Battery ( WAB ) . If score low 50 % , exclude study . If receive score great 50 % , ask provide verbal write consent sign consent form . The Principal investigator provide consent form caregiver participants.If necessary , investigator simplify terminology ensure comprehension . The investigator explain purpose research intend gather data order gain scientific knowledge necessarily benefit participant . The participant experimental group control group receive total three hour therapy . All participant receive intensive- group , two hour individual therapy . Experimental Group -- Participants receive tDCS 1mA 20min total three hour intensive speech therapy time begin session . Stimulation provide via electrode use Starstim device . The anodal electrode place inferior frontal gyrus area perilesional area , Broca 's area damage cathodal electrode place contralateral orbital frontal right hemisphere . For Sham experimental group stimulation ramp 45 second ramp 15 second . For experimental group stimulation ramp 45 second stay 20 min sham group ramp initial 45 second . The participant receive three week tDCS continue receive intensive speech therapy five week three hour day . Intensive speech therapy continue order allow neuron stimulate . Control Group - Participants receive sham tDCS five day week three week receive intensive speech therapy . The control group 's therapy follow format experimental group . ***In individual group therapy , client expect produce complete sentence article correct tense . However , clinician provide feedback model , produce sentence use correct article tense . *** Individual Therapy : Will provide two hour Materials - Verb picture card ( verb write back necessary ) , five Wh question cards- write `` Who '' `` What '' , `` Why '' , `` Where '' , `` When '' . Individual therapy use VNest framework . 1 . Clinician place verb picture card table client name verb . . If client name verb picture , clinician write word back picture card client read . If client read , clinician read client repeat . The client copy verb . 2 . Clinician ask Yes/No question related verb agent . There set 4 question provide . . If time permit end session , clinician generate Yes/No question client generate agents/objects client do first 4 easily . 3 . The client complete phonemic-semantic feature analysis chart verb produce verb . . If client generate response , clinician use response sheet provide give model . 4 . The clinician present `` Who '' card client read card . The clinician ask client generate `` Who '' ( agent ) action ( verb ) . . If client generate agent , clinician follow cue hierarchy provide ( semantic cue , phonemic cue , two choice , model response ) . 5 . The Clinician present `` What '' card client read card . The clinician ask client generate `` What '' ( object ) person action ( verb ) . . If client generate agent , clinician follow cue hierarchy provide ( semantic cue , phonemic cue , two choice , model response ) . 6 . The client combine agent , action , object ( SVO ) . 1 . If client generate phrase , clinician provide phrase orthographically client read . If client read phrase , clinician read client repeat phrase . The client ask copy phrase read . 2 . If client combine word , ask write . If write , clinician write client copy read . 7 . The clinician ask client three ( 3 ) Wh- question regard SVO sentence generate step 6 . ( Who ____ ? , What ____ ? , What ____ with/to ? ) 8 . Clinician ask client generate sentence , action ( verb ) , agent , object relate daily life . 1 . If client generate sentence , clinician use cue hierarchy provide ( semantic cue , phonemic cue , two choice , model response ) . 2 . The client ask write sentence read aloud . . If client write sentence , clinician write client copy sentence . If client read , clinician read client repeat . 9 . The client show EFA `` Beach Picture '' ask generate verb ( action ) related picture expand generate subject ( agent ) object . The client ask write his/her response . Every session , client expect generate sentence different verb . 1 . If client unable generate sentence , clinician model client repeat . If client unable write sentence , clinician write client copy . Group Therapy : Group Therapy hour . The participant work ask `` Wh '' question use verbs client . Also , work name agent , object give verb describe video show use complete sentence . The video scene contain different action relate trained verb . There twelve ( 12 ) video use . For group activity , client alternate turn . The following step follow therapy : In step one , six ( 6 ) total trial . If client unable produce verbal response , prompt write response first produce . 1 . The clinician show group video show action client generate sentence describe `` Who '' ( agent ) `` What '' ( object ) relate action . . If client generate sentence , client attempt generate sentence . If neither client able generate sentence , clinician provide model . . Once client able generate `` Who '' ( agent ) `` What '' ( object ) 80 % accuracy cueing , clinician begin cue client expand sentence use `` When '' `` Where . '' 2 . There three set card : one write verb , one picture verb , one wh-questions . 1 . One client pull write picture verb card name verb . Each client use PSFA chart generate one attribute give verb . 2 . The client pull wh- question generate question use wh-question word verb . . If client unable generate question , clinician provide model client repeat . c. The client generate answer question . . If client unable generate response , clinician provide model client repeat . d. Both client write response ( SVO ) , either response give step c new response . . If client unable write response , client clinician provide response client copy . e. The client read response write step d. f. The client name verb g. Repeat step a-f , alternate client . EVALUATION 1 . All participant assess use Communicative Effectiveness Index , Western Aphasia Battery ( part 1 ) , Boston Naming Test , Northwestern Assessment Verbs Sentences ( exclude verb name subtest ) , train untrained verb noun picture , train untrained verb picture . 2 . The WAB use determine participant 's type aphasia aphasia quotient ( AQ ) . 3 . Each participant 's spontaneous speech sample subtest WAB analyze . The sample analyze number word sentence . 4 . In addition , participant structural pre-scan understand lesion site . 5 . The participant re-assessed eight week intervention , three month intervention , six month intervention , one year intervention ass maintenance . 6 . After eight week intervention , participant continue receive treatment wish continue work skill .</detailed_description>
