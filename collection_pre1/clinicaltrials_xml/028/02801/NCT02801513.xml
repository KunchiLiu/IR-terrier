	<brief_title>Maintaining Mechanisms Chronic Depression Their Changeability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent engagement maladaptive pattern think hallmark depression . In suffer chronic course disorder , tendency towards engagement pattern think likely become habitual automatic nature . Recent research begin elucidate potential cognitive neurophysiological base persistence . There evidence depress patient show significant deficit performance monitoring ( Weinberg , Dieterich , &amp; Riesel , 2015 ) . Research error-related negativity ( ERN ) , signal occurs briefly commission error , report significant aberration depress suggest deficit early stage process discrepancy . Deficits ERN suggest serve endophenotype depression psychopathology generally ( Manoach &amp; Agam , 2013 ) . Preliminary finding suggest deficit remain even symptom reduce follow establish treatment . Similarly , evidence increase tendency elaborate negative information evidence strong late positive potential ( LPP ; Auerbach , Stanton , Proudfit , &amp; Pizzagalli , 2015 ) increase rigidity spontaneous activity brain rest indicate increase long-range temporal correlation spontaneous brain oscillation ( LRTC ; Bornas et al. , 2013 ) . Interventions use mental training may particularly suit address aberration . Indeed even brief training mindfulness find significant neuroplastic effect ( Tang et al. , 2010 ) The aim current study therefore investigate effect brief intervention use train mindfulness meditation list parameter . Chronically depressed patient randomly allocate receive either two-week mindfulness train rest control training . EEG measure intervention along self-reports current symptom resilience/vulnerability factor . We expect mindfulness training significantly strong effect ERN , LPP , LRTC rest control training .</detailed_description>
