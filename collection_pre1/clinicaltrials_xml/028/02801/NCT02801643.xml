	<brief_title>The Impact Reward-induced Dopamine Release Functional Connectivity : Combined PET/fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . To test relationship reward-induced dopamine ( DA ) release change rest state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) healthy subject . In 20 healthy adult , investigator examine reward-induced DA release ( measure use positron emission tomography , PET ) ventral striatum , thalamus , prefrontal cortex , previously describe . Before reward task investigator examine RSFC ( measure use functional magnetic resonance imaging , fMRI ) structure , show form functional pathway serve motivation emotion regulation rodent nonhuman primate . The investigator hypothesize DA release impact functional relationship structure determine change RSFC . Sub-Aim 1 . In subset subject , evaluate use VersaPET estimating18F-fallypride level plasma . The VersaPET device ( developed Dr. Paul Vaska , Co-PI ) use measure level plasma radioactivity . This PET device place around low leg allow continuous high-resolution , fast frame image artery leg completely non-invasive manner , whole-body PET scanner acquires image brain . The radioactivity derive device , well result outcome measure , compare estimate arterial analysis . The overall goal evaluate whether future study device use noninvasive alternative arterial line purpose determine blood input function compartmental modeling . This device use available , case-by-case basis ( Dr. Vaska , personal communication ) . Of 20 subject propose , investigator expect half use device . Aim 2 . To examine relationship dopamine release Reward Positivity ( RewP ) potential . Subjects present option participate event-related potential ( ERP ) study . The investigator correlate amount DA release amplitude RewP potential , ERP enhance reward versus non-reward circumstance . Based previous study , investigator hypothesize RewP amplitude positively correlate dopamine release nucleus accumbens .</detailed_description>
