	<brief_title>Long Term Effect Early Iron Supplementation Psychosocial Stimulation Growth Development Iron-deficient Anaemic Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Millions young child develop country developmental deficit due preventable factor like poor nutrition , lack stimulating environment , poverty . Although Bangladesh well achieve MDGs , still poor nutrition , poverty poor parental education prevalent . These mutually exclusive factor implication individual ' future also national income development . Usually , iron deficiency neonatal period early childhood consider key development disturbance cognitive development . There increase evidence iron deficiency anemia detrimentally affect child 's development . Many cross sectional study show iron deficiency associate poor psycho motor development behavioral deficit young child , poor cognition school achievement school-aged child . However , anemia associate many adverse social economic family circumstance may adversely affect child 's development . Nutrition along early child development intervention additive synergistic effect child development , case , nutritional outcome . Meta analysis , study conduct low , middle high income country randomize controlled trial among primary school age child ( 5-12 year ) show concurrent iron supplementation improve global cognitive score growth reduce risk anemia iron deficiency among anemic child 50 % 75 % respectively . According Lancet review child development iron deficiency anemia early childhood , brain growth spurt occur one identify risk factor later development . Similarly early psycho social stimulation act protective factor optimize later development . Studies Indonesia Canada find benefit iron treatment infant ' motor development mental development . It suggest poor level mental development find IDA infant may irreversible circumstance . One systematic review meta analysis reveal daily iron supplementation 2 5 year child increase hemoglobin ferretin limit evidence cognitive development physical growth.. Anemia public health problem Bangladesh 51 % young child age 6 59 month suffer main cause problem iron deficiency . A study conduct Bangladesh find non significant benefit motor development iron alone however power study extremely limited group receive iron zinc benefit motor development . We also conduct cluster randomize control trial 2007-2008 6-24 month old iron deficient anemic ( IDA ) non- anemic non-iron deficient ( NANI ) child iron supplementation IDA child 6 month weekly psycho social stimulation child stimulation cluster 9 month Bangladesh . The result show although intervened IDA group recover iron deficient status 9 month , hey significantly low psycho motor development index ( PDI ) responsiveness examiner compare NANI group . Random-effects multilevel regression developmental score show psycho social stimulation improve child 's mental development Index ( MDI ) group . Interaction iron status stimulation show suggestive trend indicate child IDA NANI respond differently stimulation , i.e . IDA group improve less NANI group . During time predict benefit Iron supplementation psycho social stimulation child may appear later life application sensitive measurement tool intelligence . The present study provide u unique opportunity examine long term effect early iron supplementation psycho social stimulation growth development iron deficient anemic child . Hypothesis : 3 . The benefit early iron supplementation addition Psycho social stimulation growth development IDA infant appear later life . 4 . Addition early psycho social stimulation treat IDA child help catch non-anemic peer development time . Study Objective ( ) 1 . To determine long term effect early psycho social stimulation provide age 6-24 month addition iron treatment IDA child growth ( height , weight Head Circumference ) , IQ , executive function , school achievement , fine motor behavior 2 . To compare growth development IDA infant non-anemic infant 7 year intervention iron supplementation psycho social stimulation . Study Setting Location : 30 village Monohardi Upazilla Narsingdi district . Study design : Follow-up cluster randomize control trial . In original study randomization do village level psycho social stimulation . Two hundred twelve child ( 106 anemic 106 non anemic ) age 6-12 month `` stimulation-villages ( S ) '' receive age specific psycho social stimulation 212 child `` non-stimulation village ( NS : 106 anemic 106 non anemic ) enrol control . Mild moderately anemic ( Hb 80.0-109 g/L ) iron deficient ( ferritin &lt; 12 μg/L ) child assign village ( S NS ) receive ferrous-sulphate ( Fe2SO4 ) syrup . Children consider non-anemic Hb &gt; 110 g/L ferritin level ≥12 μg/L . For group parental education less X grade . Sample : All child participate original study age 6 24 month locate enrol . IDA group : All child identify IDA early childhood ( 6-24 month ) base Hb level 80-110 g/L sTfR level ≥ 5.0 mg/L . Non-anemic group : All child identify NANI early childhood base Hb &gt; 110g/L sTfR &lt; 5.0 mg/L ) live rural area . . Identification sample : study try track child address available mobile phone number register enrollment . The study also contact local staff work play leader health worker close contact family help u locate child . Randomization : In original study village least 12 child ( 6 IDA 6 NANI ) age 6-24 month select randomly assign either psycho social stimulation non-stimulation group . Intervention In original study anemic child early childhood receive 30 mg ferrous sulfate daily base recommendation WHO IOM report 6 month . The psycho social intervention last 9 month include play demonstration home play leader ( PL ) train visit home teach mother child development care practice . The study show mother play child use toys way promote good child development . Plan work : After take write consent , identify mother child interview home base measurement ( SES , HOME &amp; SDQ ) team two member - one trained tester ( graduate psychology social science ) one health worker ( high school graduate ) . The mother invite come along child test center ( centrally locate village ) developmental anthropocentric assessment . The tester conduct psychological assessment child health worker assist bring test . The tester health worker unaware intervention group ( blind ) . Four team start assessment time 4 village rotate next complete one . assume tester complete assessment 10-12 child one village approximately two half day . Measurements In current follow-up , age around 8-9 year available child measure : • WASI : The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence - Second Edition ( WASI-II ) , revision WASI , provide brief , reliable measure cognitive ability use clinical , educational research setting . It consist four sub test : Vocabulary , Block Design , Similarities Matrix Reasoning . Scores sub test lead calculate performance IQ ( PIQ ) , verbal IQ ( VIQ ) well full scale IQ ( FSIQ ) . The average reliability coefficient WASI subtest range .87 .92 overall child 's sample ( Guilford1954 Nunnally 1978 ) . WASI use group Bangladesh previously culturally adapt use . The adapted translated version assess face validity use show meaningful correlation nutritional socio-economic variable ( Ali- personal communication ) . Previous study conduct u show cognitive testing picture , pilot original test 35 child Gaibandha 20 child Dhaka , re-ranked item accord difficulty . The test retest reliability adapt tool range 0.77 0.86 different subscales . - School achievement : Children 's school achievement measure use locally develop test base 'wide range achievement test ( WRAT ) measure mathematics , reading , write comprehension ability . In addition grade level , number grade repeat , attendance school , age enrolment primary school , age leave school , preschool attendance etc . also measure . This test use member group previous intervention study rural Bangladesh sensitive change serum iodine . This adapted version school achievement test show good face validity test . It also show high concurrent validity ( r=0.71 ) Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children ( WISC-IV ) 10 year moderately high predictive validity ( r=0.54 ) Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale Intelligence ( WPPSI ) use 5 year recently complete cohort study Bangladesh ( Tofail -personal communication ) . It also show meaningful correlation socio-economic variable , parental education child 's nutritional status . - Number Stroop : The number Stroop measure executive function child . It psychological test mental ( selective attention ) vitality flexibility . It use Bangladesh another study Gaibandha pick intervention effect ( Ali- personal communication ) . We also use modify word color stroop test Matlab show reasonable concurrent validity ( r &gt; 0.45 ) cognitive measure socio-demographic variable .We conduct pilot test number stroop study assess face validity test -retest reliability use . - Strength difficulty questionnaire ( SDQ ) : use identify behavioral emotional problem child base mother 's report . It widely internationally used brief behavioral screen instrument assess child positive negative attribute across 5 sub-scales : 1 ) Emotional Symptoms , 2 ) Conduct Problems , 3 ) Hyperactivity-Inattention , 4 ) Peer Problems , 5 ) Pro social Behavior . The SDQ extensively research various population translate 40 language . Reliability generally satisfactory assess internal consistency : ( mean Cronbach α : 0.73 ) , cross-informant correlation ( mean : 0.34 ) , retest stability 4 6 month ( mean : 0.62 ) . Our team use several study Bangladesh show meaningful correlation sub-scales socio-economic variable . We use parent 's report SDQ show good face validity conceptually meaningful pattern cross-scale correlation acceptable internal reliability estimate find subscale . At five year age pick intervention effect prenatal supplementation recent analysis . - Memory sub test NEuro PSYchological ( NEPSY ) Assessment : comprehensive instrument design assess neuro psychological development provide insight regard academic , social , behavioral difficulty preschool school-age child . We use memory test NEPSY . We use memory test one recent rural study school child . Although use Bangladesh earlier pilot current population modify adapt accordingly . - Digit span : Digit span forward backward use measure memory executive function child . It use part Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children ( WISC-IV ) 10 year old child currently use one study rural population . It show good face validity test retest reliability 7 day . We also pilot current study area non-study child modify adapt accordingly use . - HOME : middle childhood version home observation measurement environment use assess quality home stimulation . Overall inter-observer reliability middle childhood -HOME report satisfactory . Percentage agreement specific item EC-HOME range 79-100 % Cohen 's kappa value range 0.45 1 . Intraclass correlation subscale score interval 0.79 0.94 . The intraclass correlation total scale 0.92 . It use several study Bangladesh show moderately high concurrent validity IQ measure ( r &gt; 0.5 ) . - Fine motor skill use Purdue peg board Movement Assessment Battery Children- 2 ( age -band 2 7-10 year ) : prefer conduct MABC-2 , make decision piloting test . Correlations MABC-2 test component range 0.25 0.36 ( indicate little overlap subtests ) . Correlation score range 0.73 0.84 component score equal 0.80 total test score . The study conduct earlier u MABC Bangladesh young child MABC-2 8-year old child . This time pilot study do current study area non-study child modify adapt accordingly use . - Socio economic status ( SES ) measure use standard questionnaire . Anthropometric measurement : Children 's height , weight circumference measure use standard measures.All measure culturally adapt Bangladesh use previously group . All instrument ready use pre-tested community use . Reliabilities Inter-observer reliability assess measurement study begin study 10 % measurement . Sample Size In original study sample size calculate 212 child IDA NANI group consider 5 % level significance , 80 % power , improvement 0.5 SD child 's development , ICC 0.01 , design effect 1.5 25 % drop out . In follow-up ass available child group . In original study analysis show effect clustering . Therefore need account design effect sample size without design effect 64 group . Considering drop 10 % , need enrol 70 child group believe possible track many child village sufficient power conduct study . Data Analysis After cod , data enter personal computer use SPSS 11.5 software . We check normality data . Log transformation do data positively skew . The characteristic test lose group compare use 'student test ' ANOVA continuous variable χ2 categorical variable . Pearson 's bivariate correlation conduct explore association age child developmental measure . The sociodemographic characteristic growth measure baseline compare IDA NANI group well stimulate unstimulated group use random effect ANOVA . Finally , fit random-effects multilevel regression model intelligence score nutritional outcome score use intention-to-treat analysis . We investigate effect IDA/NANI group stimulated/ unstimulated group interaction . In regression analysis , outcome final developmental score , adjust relevant initial score , along select covariates identify con-founders .
