	<brief_summary>Peritoneal fibrosis may occur serious complication peritoneal dialysis . It 's main factor UFF could lead Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis ( EPS ) . Using potential feature MSCs treatment fibrosis may offer new insight reconstruction damage tissue . The project intend transplant autologous MSCs ten peritoneal dialysis patient ultra-filtration failure . It 's go study infusion effect clinical , cellular molecular level . So trial , evaluate effect intervention intravenous injection autologous adipose derive mesenchymal stem cell 10 peritoneal dialysis patient ultra filtration failure ( UFF ) . Fifteen UFF patient also consider control group . Then follow 20 , 45 90 day , also 4 6 month first injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Autologous Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells ( AD-MSC ) Transplantation Ultra Filtration Failure ( UFF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease define reduced glomerular filtration rate , increase urinary albumin excretion , , increase public health issue . Prevalence estimate 8-16 % worldwide . Stage 5 CKD often call end-stage kidney disease usually mean patient require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) , may involve kidney transplant form dialysis . One option RRT continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . CAPD characterize continuous removal extracellular fluid peritoneal membrane . It note like peritoneal dialysis therapy , CAPD Short long-term complication UFF common functional disorder peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damage . This project intend evaluate , role autologous mesenchymal stem cell improvement peritoneal membrane function peritoneal dialysis patient ultrafiltration failure 6 month . In study , 10 male female subject peritoneal dialysis least two year ultrafiltration failure age range 18 70 year enrol . Patients select peritoneal dialysis patient attend peritoneal dialysis ward Dr. Shariati hospital . The main inclusion criterion peritoneal dialysis least last two year Ultrafiltration failure . After obtain consent form , sample fat tissue obtain general surgeon sterilize condition patient specialized lab , mesenchymal stem cell separate cultured reach appropriate number ( 106/kg ) . The cell injected peripheral vein hospital setting . Patients followed-up ( clinically laboratory ) baseline week 3 , week 6 , month 3 , month 4 month 6 . The clinical assessment peritoneal function test perform visit . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure periodically assess include : D/P cr , D/P urea , D0/D glucose , PET , KT/V urea , Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR )</detailed_description>
