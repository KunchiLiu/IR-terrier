	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) result combination insufficient insulin secretion pancreatic islet insulin resistance target cell . The investigator extensive pre-clinical data suggest BSE high content isothiocyanate sulforaphane improve hepatic insulin sensitivity . BSE dietary supplement could therefore benefit patient T2D individual risk disease . BSE-containing sulforaphane suggest activate Nuclear factor-like 2 ( NRF2 ) . The investigator aim study clinical effect use BSE dietary supplement glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Broccoli Sprout Extract Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sulforaphane bind Keap1 cytosol , lead nuclear translocation transcription factor . In nucleus NRF2 induces expression large number anti-oxidative gene . Sulforaphane contain high concentration broccoli sprout extract ( BSE ) . Human study conduct use broccoli sprout product without complication . It test treatment prevention cancer inflammatory diseases ~30 clinical trial without serious adverse event report . The low toxicity make BSE ideal dietary supplement prevent treat T2D . The investigator aim study clinical effect sulforaphane glucose tolerance T2D patient . Sulforaphane give BSE . BSE freeze-dried powder aqueous extract broccoli sprout provide consistent stable source sulforaphane . The investigator use parallel arm study design patient receive BSE placebo . The randomization double-blind . The study do one centre . Patients BMI 25-40 kg/m2 include . Another inclusion criterion HbA1c 6-10 % . Patients treat 12 week enable u observe effect HbA1c ( HbA1c turn-over 3 month ) . Patients come screen visit give inform consent include attend second visit 2-3 week later . The patient undergo oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 12-week treatment period . The reason use OGTT rather e.g . insulin clamp readout harmless standard procedure give integrate view glucose tolerance .</detailed_description>
