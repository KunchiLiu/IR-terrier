	<detailed_description>This trial part project : ' A novel technique reliable , precise safe postoperative pain management ' ( project . 65-2014-3 ) . Results contribute development electrical disposable infusion pump manufacture Ferrosan Medical Devices ( FEMD ) . It make two half 's ; first intervene day focus common peroneal nerve , second intervening day focus sciatic nerve . Hypothesis : The infusion rate single peri-neural injection LA influence duration lower limb nerve block . Trial objective : We wish compare five peri-neural infusion rate LA independent factor duration nerve block , sciatic nerve common peroneal nerve , healthy volunteer . The slow infusion simulate standard infusion rate continuous infusion . The fast infusion simulate standard bolus rate administer LA bolus . The three infusion knowledge new alternative infusion rate . Trial design : Prospective , randomise , blind , single centre , healthy volunteer study . Intervention medication : Ropivacaine 0.2 % Detailed description intervention : Baseline measurement safety precautions The volunteer meet Clinical Research Unit , Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød , follow six-hour fast . After baseline measurement , insert peripheral intravenous catheter start continuous pulse oximetry . Placing catheter We insert one peri-neural catheter intervention day : 1 . Adjacent common peroneal nerve non-dominant side . The participant supine dominant side . 2 . Adjacent proximal part sciatic nerve non-dominant side . The participant prone position . An expert peripheral nerve block perform catheter placement sterile manner , use ultrasound ( US ) guide short-axis , needle in-plane technique high frequency linear transducer . Using lidocaine 1 % raise small skin wheal needle entry point anaesthetise trajectory catheter needle . 3 mL isotonic saline deposit peri-neural tissue place catheter . This ensure optimal condition place nerve catheter . Successful catheter orifice placement ensure visually confirmation echogenic marking catheter 2 mL isotonic saline injection orifice . After insertion , sterile dressing place , cover catheter . Absorption peri-neural space We verify full absorption isotonic saline peri-neural space US . When full absorption confirm , member investigator team must leave room . Preparation infusion A trial-affiliated nurse part investigator team prepare one 50 ml syringe , imbibe 30 mL ropivacaine 0.5 % . This step over-looked random , un-affiliated college ensure double-control correct intervention . Peri-neural infusion The trial-affiliated nurse connect transfusion hose mount syringe infusion pump . The nurse activate 2 mL bolus infusion pump , flush transfusion hose connect transfusion hose nerve catheter . The trial-affiliated nurse open opaque envelope match participant prepare infusion administration prescribe accord one five infusion group : Infusion Groups Infusion rate [ mL/hour ] / [ mL/min ] IG1 12 / 0.2 IG2 60 / 1 IG3 300 / 5 IG4 600 / 10 IG5 1800 / 30 This step over-looked random , un-affiliated college ensure double-control correct intervention . The trial-affiliated nurse start infusion investigator team allow back . Measuring outcome The outcome measure follow way : 1 . Measuring length neural exposure ropivacaine five time , accord calculate infusion time . 2 . Finding sensory onset time five minute interval . 3 . Grading degree sensory nerve block register onset time . 4 . Grading degree motor nerve block catheter remove . Investigators start test sensory onset time 10 minute start infusion . All outcomes outcome measurement describe detail section `` Outcomes '' . To ensure manipulation catheter affect distribution absorption LA , catheter remove 30 minute end slow infusion . We estimate mean maximal duration sciatic nerve block seventeen twenty-four hour , respectively15,20-24 . Consequently , duration study day expect twenty-four hour . The volunteer offer discharge time complete nerve block remission . In exceptional case incomplete nerve block remission within twenty-four hour , volunteer ask stay admit continue test . At time , adequately trained health-care personnel rescue medicine resuscitation equipment hand proximity volunteer . Intervention related information - Members investigator team medical doctor skilled perform US-guided peripheral nerve block insert peripheral nerve catheter . - The Certa Catheter™ use recommended manufacturer . - Study medication well medication use concomitant care handle accord local guideline provide store The Department Anaesthesiology Intensive Care , Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød via hospital pharmacy use . During study period , week , medication take locked storage Post Anaesthesia Care Unit lock storage Clinical Research Unit , Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød . - All personnel involve conduction intervention adequately educate experienced performing basal resuscitation . Discontinuance The intervention discontinue : - participant withdraws consent . - participant experience symptoms LA systemic toxicity . - participant exhibit symptom allergic reaction . - suspicion nerve injury In addition specific reason , adverse reaction severity lack compliance instruction may cause discontinuance . Concomitant care 1 . Sedation If indicate , investigator administer midazolam ( 0.03 mg/kg ) . 2 . Treatment pain Skin infiltration anaesthesia necessary inserting catheter investigator administer maximum 2 mL lidocaine 1 mg/mL subcutaneous papilla , ensure non-influential proximity sciatic nerve . If participant experience unbearable pain insertion catheter administration standard short acting , intravenous analgesic ( 0.5-1.5 mg Rapifen depend weight , age administration sedation ) allow . 3 . General care During trial day participant receive meal , snack tap water . The participant bed available time , place two-person room . Sample size : To able detect difference power 80 % margin error 5 % , test null-hypothesis , need participant number infusion group large 10.9 . Thus , infusion group least 11 participant , make sample size intervention-day least 55 total sample size least 110 . To account potential dropout , wish include 60 healthy volunteer intervention-day , total 120 healthy volunteer . Sequence generation : study number block-randomised electronically non-trial-affiliated person one five equally size infusion group first intervention day . This step repeat second intervention day . Allocation concealment mechanism : Until study termination FIPRA 1 , allocation sequence conceal investigator team note electronically computer belong Research Unit , Department Anaesthesiology Intensive Care , Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød . Blinding : All volunteer outcome assessor blind LA administration infusion procedure . Harms Unanticipated problem involve risk subject others , adverse event adverse reaction review report accordance current think The Danish Unit Good Clinical Practice The Danish Medicines Agency . The reporting happen within timeframe state order clinical trial drug human subject ( order # 295 26th April 2004 The Danish Law ) Research ethic approval This trial conduct accord guideline provide The International Council Harmonisation ( ICH ) , The Danish Unit Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) The Declaration Helsinki3 . We register/announce study The Scientific Ethics Committee , The Danish Health Medicines Authority , The Danish Data Protection Agency , The Danish Unit Good Clinical Practice clinicaltrials.gov . The trial initiate official approval give . Access data During trial investigator access CRFs raw data material . After trial primary investigator , sponsor supervisor access full trial dataset . The data store 5 year The Research Unit , Department Anaesthesiology Intensive Care , Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød . As part Co-funding agreement Innovation Fund Denmark , NOH FEMD ( Journal . 65-2014-3 ) , result study contribute development electronic disposable infusion pump manufacture FEMD . Furthermore , publishing , FEMD , right review manuscript ensure intellectual property ( IP 's ) belonging FEMD publish . If , FEMD may claim additional thirty day submission apply new patent protection IP . FEMD allow comment change part manuscript .
