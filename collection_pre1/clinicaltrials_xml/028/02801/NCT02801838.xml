	<brief_summary>Background : Dyspnea common severely impact mechanically ventilated patient outcomes intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Recognize , measure treat dyspnea become current major therapeutic challenge . Its measurement involve self-assessment patient , definition , certain level communication . Consequently , large proportion ICU-population ( non-communicating ) miss evaluation potential benefit associate control . In hand , electrophysiological marker help detect quantify dyspnea regardless patient 's cooperation , develop validate dyspnea surrogate , namely : 1 ) electromyographic ( EMG ) activity extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle 2 ) premotor inspiratory potential ( PIP ) detect electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Because complex implementation daily practice research team develop alternatively behavioral score call IC-RDOS provide reliable dyspnea assessment also without patient participation . Validated conscious patient , yet validate non-communicating patient . Hypothesis : The IC-RDOS valid non-communicating ventilate patient allow simple reliable assessment dyspnea specific population . Objective : To validate IC-RDOS non-communicating ICU patient mechanical ventilation , use comparison tool validate reliable measure dyspnea non-communicating patient ( EMG , EEG ) . Patients Methods : In 40 patient collect simultaneously IC-RDOS , PIP ( EEG ) electromyographic activity three extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle ( scalene , parasternal Alae nasi ) intervention therapy aim reduce dyspnea ( ventilator setting pharmacological intervention ) , initiated clinician charge patient . Expected result : Observe strong positive correlation IC-RDOS electrophysiological marker ( amplitude electromyogram presence magnitude PIP ) . Observe correlation change IC-RDOS electrophysiological marker therapeutic intervention . Optimizing patient comfort prominent concern ICU . By optimize detection quantification dyspnea non-communicating patient , study ultimately improve management `` good living '' ventilate patient intensive care</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION It become clear dyspnea become major matter concern ICU mechanically ventilate patient . As case pain , address dyspnea ICU patient therefore appear highly clinically relevant . This require focused awareness caregiver patient cooperation . Indeed , dyspnea involve sensory identification afferent signal brain cognitive affective processing , characterization depend self-report . Clinical sign `` respiratory distress '' self-perceived dyspnea disconnect , set limitation identify dyspnea many ICU patient whose ability communicate verbally impair . Nevertheless , link exist dyspnea certain observable sign . A respiratory distress observation scale ( RDOS ) validate surrogate self-reported dyspnea palliative care set . In ICU patient , research team recently develop validated 5-items intensive care ( IC ) -RDOS ( heart rate , neck muscle use inspiration , abdominal paradox , fear expression , supplemental oxygen ) . The finding validate IC-RDOS potential surrogate dyspnea ICU , prove concept observation scale useful context . Indeed , IC-RDOS high sensitivity specificity predict dyspnea-VAS â‰¥4 . However , IC-RDOS validate aware patient clinical usefulness `` non communicating '' patient still need demonstrate . Addressing dyspnea `` non-communicating '' patient challenge since patient self-report dyspnea . However , mean experience dyspnea . Indeed , `` non-communicating '' `` communicate '' mechanically ventilate patient equally submit risk factor dyspnea . Moreover , ignore dyspnea `` non-communicating '' patient may increase risk inadequate ventilator setting , could turn even increase dyspnea . To address issue , research team others develop validate reliable electrophysiological maker help detect quantify dyspnea regardless patient 's self-report ability : 1 ) electromyographic ( EMG ) activity extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle 2 ) premotor inspiratory potential ( PIP ) detect electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . 1 . The EMG activity three extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle ( scalene , parasternal intercostal muscle Alae nasi ) reliable surrogate load capacity balance healthy subject patient respiratory disease . In ICU patient , EMG activity significantly correlate dyspnea-VAS . 2 . The application inspiratory resistive load healthy subject result activation pre-motor cortex detect EEG record name pre-inspiratory potential ( PIP ) . OBJECTIVE The objective study validate IC-RDOS surrogate dyspnea `` non-communicating '' mechanically ventilate patient ICU . To achieve goal , IC-RDOS compare two electrophysiological tool validate assessment dyspnea `` non-communicating '' patient , EMG extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle PIP EEG . This comparison perform therapeutic intervention aim reduces dyspnea concomitant variation scale neurophysiological marker require validate reliability scale . The specific aim simultaneously collect IC-RDOS , PIP EMG activity Scalene , Parasternal intercostal muscle Alae nasi , 1 . Before intervention , 2 . And intervention aim reduce dyspnea . STUDY DESIGN A first non-verbal measure respiratory discomfort achieve IC-RDOS experimenter . Concomitantly , EEG EMG record 15-minutes period . The therapeutic intervention aim reduce dyspnea perform clinician charge patient , strictly independent experimenter . This intervention could change ventilator setting administration pharmacological agent . The nature intervention record remain blinded experimenter . After therapeutic intervention , second non-verbal measure respiratory discomfort perform IC-RDOS . Concomitantly , EEG EMG record 15-minutes period . If physician charge patient judge necessary , second therapeutic intervention may perform . After second therapeutic intervention , third non-verbal measure respiratory discomfort perform IC-RDOS . Concomitantly , EEG EMG record 15-minutes period . EXPECTED RESULTS Observe strong positive correlation non-verbal numerical evaluation dyspnea IC-RDOS amplitude EMG activity three extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle . Observe significant positive association presence amplitude PIP value IC-RDOS . Observe significant association change IC-RDOS respective change EMG activity extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle amplitude PIP . Observe decrease proportion dyspneic patient therapeutic intervention . Observe average relative reduction IC-RDOS therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
