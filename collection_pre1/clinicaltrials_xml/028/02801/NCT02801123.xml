	<brief_summary>Background : As people survive cancer , importance research effective intervention improve quality life ( QOL ) amongst survivor grow . Two intervention substantial evidence-base Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery ( MBCR ) Tai chi/Qigong ( TCQ ) . However , intervention never directly compare . Objectives : ( 1 ) To compare MBCR TCQ waitlist control condition use innovative , randomize , preference-based comparative effectiveness trial ( CET ) design take account potential moderating factor might predict differential response . ( 2 ) To investigate impact MBCR TCQ range biological outcome include immune process , blood pressure , heart rate variability , stress hormone , cellular aging , gene expression . Methods : The study design preference-based multi-site randomize CET incorporate two Canadian site ( Calgary , AB Toronto , ON ) . Participants ( N total = 600 ) . Participants preference either MBCR TCQ get prefer intervention ; without preference randomize either two intervention . Within preference non-preference group , participant also randomize immediate intervention group wait-list control . Outcome measure assess pre- post-intervention 6-month follow include psychological outcome ( mood , stress , mindfulness , spirituality , post-traumatic growth ) , QOL , symptom ( fatigue , sleep ) , physical function ( strength , endurance ) , exploratory analysis biomarkers ( cortisol slope , cytokine , blood pressure/heart rate variability , telomere length , gene expression ) , health economic measure . Hypotheses : The investigator theorize MBCR TCQ improve outcomes amongst survivor relative treatment usual , particularly patient strong preference particular intervention . Specifically , investigator hypothesize MBCR may superior TCQ measure related stress mood . Conversely , TCQ may superior MBCR improvement physical functional measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background While ample research document problem people diagnose cancer face , include high level distress , anxiety , depression symptom fatigue , pain sleep disturbance , also limit grow body evidence support efficacy range mind-body therapy ( MBTs ) alleviate symptom . The investigator choose focus compare MBCR TCQ level 1 evidence cancer care , show potential affect important biomarkers clinical outcome . Both intervention similarly root meditative practice , MBCR great emphasis mental practice , TCQ emphatically body movement-based practice . The investigator also anticipate many patient preference one . Evidence efficacy briefly review follow detail study design method . Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery ( MBCR ) Through ongoing program research investigator adapt group intervention base intensive training mindfulness meditation ( Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ; MBSR ) specifically people cancer , call Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery ( MBCR ) , acknowledge root program also form content somewhat different , focus primarily challenge face people live cancer . It 8-week program consist weekly group meeting 1.5 2 hour , shorten traditional MBSR base practical logistical concern need study population . Home practice 45 minute per day ( 15 min yoga ; 30 min meditation ) prescribed . As week progress , different form meditation introduce , begin body scan sensory awareness experience , progress sit walk meditation . Gentle Hatha yoga incorporate throughout , form move meditation . Didactic instruction well group discussion reflection , problem solve skillful inquiry commonly apply teaching tool . Since 1998 , investigator test efficacy wide range study group people cancer , begin psychological outcome include stress symptom , mood disturbance include anxiety , anger depression , expand scope scale assess effect sleep disturbance fatigue . The investigator also examine positive outcome include post-traumatic growth , spirituality benefit find . To assess potential biological mechanism change , investigator examine effect program biomarkers include blood pressure , inflammatory cytokine , stress hormone recently telomere length use increasingly sophisticated study design , show benefit across measure . The investigator work MBCR cancer patient survivor span spectrum research basic mechanistic research clinical trial implementation science . Others , well , study MBSR cancer patient , several review meta-analyses summarize benefit across outcome anxiety , stress , mood disturbance quality life . Tai Chi/Qigong ( TCQ ) Work also do evaluate efficacy tai-chi qigong cancer care , review available . Tai chi shorten name Tai Chi Ch'uan , form martial art traditional Chinese medicine . It involve series slow specific movement `` form '' do meditative fashion . It purport focus mind solely movement form help bring state mental calm clarity . The practice separate martial art root widely taught health behavior practice exercise . In cancer care , review seven controlled trial breast cancer patient conclude tai chi help improve psychological physical health measure compare usual care , compare active intervention may superior . Overall elderly sample , large body research support efficacy improve balance prevent fall improve overall psychological well-being , large study well design need . Similarly , grow body research suggest efficacy qigong , practice align breath , movement , awareness exercise , healing , meditation . Qigong traditionally view practice cultivate balance qi ( chi ) `` intrinsic life energy '' . Qigong exercise generally three component : posture ( whether move stationary ) , breathe technique , mental focus guide qi body . A review literature include Chinese Korean database find 23 study cancer care . The consistent benefit see immune system function ( reduced inflammation ) , improve mood , quality life , fatigue . As case tai chi study , randomize control trial large sample size necessary generalize finding . The study protocol incorporate simple Tai Chi element within heal framework stem Qigong principle . For reason investigator call Tai Chi/Qigong ( TCQ ) .</detailed_description>
