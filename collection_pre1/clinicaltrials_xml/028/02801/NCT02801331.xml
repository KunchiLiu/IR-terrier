	<brief_title>Efficacy Outcomes Non-Pharmacological Intervention Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test therapeutic efficacy stochastic vibrotactile stimulation ( SVS ) reduce withdrawal symptom , pharmacological requirement hospitalization , improve neurobehavioral developmental outcome opioid-exposed newborn . Candidates at-risk NAS due opioid exposure utero identify investigator medical caregiver and/or prescreened use HIPAA Waiver recruitment ( maternal-prenatal ; infant-postnatal ) . Infants randomize either SVS ( complementary standard care ) Standard Clinical Care ( SCC ) , restrict equipment ( mattress ) availability . Infants enrol within 24 hour post birth participate throughout hospitalization . Infants assign SVS receive daily intervention continuous SVS throughout hospitalization use specially construct crib mattress delivers gentle vibration preset interval . Specific Aim 1 . Determine efficacy SVS non-pharmacological therapy complementary standard clinical care ( SCC ) reduce severity duration opioid withdrawal newborn compare SCC alone . Quantify clinical variable : NAS severity , day hospital , velocity weight gain , cumulative morphine dose . Specific Aim 2 . Compare neurobehavioral outcome fetal drug-exposed infant infant receive SVS receive SCC . Longitudinal outcomes assessment 1 month , 6-months 1 year test whether early intervention SVS compare standard care improve physical , social , emotional cognitive development .</detailed_description>
