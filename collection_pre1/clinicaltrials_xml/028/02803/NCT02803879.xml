	<brief_summary>Some patient heart failure require treatment call cardiac-resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) involve put pacemaker heart make ventricle ( low chamber heart ) contract together , make pump blood rest body efficient . important get CRT pacemaker check make sure work correctly perform job . However difficult adjust setting pacemaker right amount ensure heart pump efficiently . One way do use special machine use ultrasound make 2-dimensional image heart call echocardiogram . This technique also use measure flow blood heart calculate efficient pump blood . However adjusting setting pacemaker device difficult use time consume . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 2-dimensional electrical tracing heart activity another tool use help adjust setting pacemaker , make heart pump efficiently . Furthermore , recent research show well echocardiogram optimise pacemaker device setting . A new type ECG call cardiogoniometry ( CGM ) recently develop create 3-dimensional view heart electrical activity already show well normal ECG diagnose certain condition like angina heart attack . However never use try optimise setting pacemaker use CRT hope quicker easy use method available . More importantly hope reduce symptom patient suffer make heart pump efficiently . As untested never use setting , need know first CGM machine recognise setting pacemaker change . The aim study see CGM machine pick change pacemaker setting , hope run later study see use optimise setting pacemaker use CRT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) improve symptoms quality life improve prognosis patient chronic heart failure . CRT work improve co-ordination cardiac contraction , indicated people heart failure leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) ECG . The importance LBBB indicate electricity spread slowly surface heart heart beat , thereby make contraction `` dyssynchronous '' ; , instead heart muscle contract simultaneously , part contract relax part even start contract . With standard pacemaker , pace lead implant right ventricle . In patient normal heart rhythm ( `` sinus rhythm '' ) , second lead usually place right atrium close heart 's natural pacemaker . The lead ventricle track heart 's natural heart rate detect lead atrium , , natural rate slow , pacemaker sequentially pace atrium ventricle . A CRT system similar , addition extra lead position pace leave ventricle . Now , pacemaker able stimulate leave right ventricle simultaneously , restore normal co-ordination ventricular contraction . Approximately 25 % patient achieve significant clinical benefit CRT . Such patient term `` non-responders '' , lack response typically measured failure improve exercise capacity CRT , failure heart improve echocardiography . One option reduce number non-responders may optimise CRT device adjust setting base clinical variable ( ECG echocardiogram finding ) . Both ECG echocardiogram optimisation give similar result term clinical response CRT , patient CRT optimise use ECG variable significantly great impact echocardiographic response , great proportion group LV end-systolic volume reduction &gt; 10 % ) 3 . Another possibility optimise CRT cardiogoniometry ( CGM ) , study aim investigate . CGM form 3D vector electrocardiography provide quantitative analysis myocardial depolarisation repolarisation . Like standard 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , CGM use different electrode identify electrical potential gradient produce cardiac electrical activity . The ECG visually represent information two dimensional way , whereas CGM create three dimensional display . Electrode placement important : complex mathematical modelling use generate display . CGM give output standard ECG . One additional output vector loop graph . These sequentially plot value electrical activity heart x , z axis , three orthogonal plane . When vector loop follow pathway mean electrical activity heart follow pathway ventricular depolarisation repolarisation . By contrast , abnormal electrical conduction , vector loop pathway vary . CGM useful identify stable coronary artery disease recognise acute coronary syndrome , clinical value outside patient acute ischaemic heart disease unclear . We aim conduct feasibility study see CGM detect different setting CRT device , assess CGM vector loop different device setting . Based result study , aim investigate whether CRT optimise try align vector loop pathway use CGM .</detailed_description>
