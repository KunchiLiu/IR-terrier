	<brief_summary>Septic syndrome ( systemic inflammatory response associate infection ) remain major although largely under-recognized health care problem represent first cause mortality intensive care unit . While long know sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis induce tremendous systemic inflammatory response , novel finding indicate sepsis indeed initiate complex immunologic response varies time , concomitant occurrence pro- anti-inflammatory mechanism . As resultant , short pro-inflammatory phase , septic patient enter stage protract immunosuppression . This illustrated patient reactivation dormant virus ( CMV HSV ) infection due pathogen , include fungi , normally pathogenic solely immunocompromised host . These alteration might directly responsible worsen outcome patient survive initial resuscitation nearly immune function deeply compromise . Both arm immunity ( innate adaptive ) indeed markedly suppress ( include enhance leukocyte apoptosis , lymphocyte anergy deactivate monocyte function ) . New promise therapeutic avenue currently emerge recent finding adjunctive immunostimulation immunosuppressed patient . The prerequisite immunostimulation administration ( IFNg , GM-CSF , IL-7 ) however rely investigator capacity identify patient could benefit , clinical sign immune dysfunction . The main objective : 1. identify best biomarkers sepsis-induced immunosuppression 2. evaluate ex vivo whether drug could rejuvenate immune function .</brief_summary>
