	<brief_summary>Lymph node metastasis one common sit develop disease recurrence progression initial local treatment primary solid malignancy systemic treatment advanced metastasis . No specific treatment modality establish standard therapy . Systemic therapy usually consider since lymphadenopathy consider sign disease dissemination though aggressive local treatment , include surgical lymphoadenectomy radical radiotherapy might result long-term survival select patient . The concept stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) , high dose radiation target pathological entity deliver fraction , proven successful treat benign malignant lesion change paradigm radiation therapy . The radiobiology SABR show favorable tumor control . Clinical experience suggest SABR might offer excellent in-field tumor control low toxicity profile select patient , although majority report retrospective include small patient series heterogeneous tumor sit dose-fractionation schedule . At present , lack validated prognostic factor identify patient might benefit ablative local therapy metastatic lymph node ( ) . The mechanism effect SABR cancer lesion yet clear . Apart direct effect clonogenic cancer cell , immune-mediated process also hypothesize . Therefore , present study aim provide well understanding utilization SABR metastatic lymph node ( ) . The associated translational research also advance knowledge immune system reaction SABR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy Metastatic Lymphadenopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institutional , single-arm , phase II trial ass local control rate oligo-metastatic oligo-progressive lymph node treat stereotactic ablative radiotherapy 1 year . Patients pathologically proven non-hematopoietic malignancy patient radiographic evidence evaluable regional recurrent , oligo-metastatic oligo-progressive lymph node eligible enrolment . Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy : The lymph node plan target volume ( PTV ) receive prescribe dose accord assigned treatment group . The dose prescribed 90-95 % PTV cover prescription dose . If critical structure exceed define dose limitation , dose reduction method apply protocol define . Dose inhomogeneity exist within clinical target volume ( CTV ) . Treatment deliver six fraction target volume give per day , 2-3 fraction per week 2 daily consecutive fraction , 2 2.5 week . Target Radiation Dose : SABR 45 Gy six fraction define target volume meet organ-at-risk constraint criterion use intensity modulate radiotherapy volumetric modulate arc therapy ( VMAT RapidArc ) . Radiation Dose Reduction : Reduced Dose 10 % : SABR 40.05 Gy six fraction define target volume meet organ-at-risk constraint criterion Reduced Dose 20 % : SABR 36 Gy six fraction define target volume meet organ-at-risk constraint criterion</detailed_description>
