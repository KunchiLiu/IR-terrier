	<detailed_description>In part study , subject enrol study within 28 day screen . The study consist two part , subject assign follow : Part A- single escalating dos This part study single-site , randomize , double-blind , double dummy , placebo-controlled single-dose study Aramchol healthy Chinese volunteer . The purpose Part A evaluate PK , safety tolerability Aramchol tablets single dos either 400 mg 600 mg. Thirty-two ( 32 ) subject participate part study randomize receive single-dose 400 mg Aramchol , 600 mg Aramchol , Placebo . Drug administration precede light breakfast consume within 1 hour prior dose . All drug administer study staff . In order maintain blinding , subject receive two tablet dose , accord follow administration : - Cohort A : 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet ( 12 subject ) - Cohort B : 1 x 200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet ( 12 subject ) - Cohort C : 1 x 200mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Placebo tablet ( 8 subject ) Subjects admit in-house even first study drug administration ( Day 0 ) remain in-house 36 hour dose . Blood sample Aramchol concentration draw 36 hour designate time point describe . Additional ambulatory sample collect 48 , 72 , 96 , 144 hour postdose . Subjects continuously monitor safety . An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit take place last PK sample day , ie , 144 hour last dose administration . If PK profile Part A similar exist PK data non- Chinese subject , study may stop . If PK profile different , Part B study may perform . Part B- multiple escalating dos Part B study single-site , randomize , double-blind , doubledummy , placebo-controlled multiple-dose study Aramchol healthy Chinese volunteer . The purpose part evaluate PK , safety tolerability Aramchol tablets multiple administration two different dos . Thirty-two ( 32 ) subject participate part study equally randomize receive 400 mg Aramchol , 600 mg Aramchol , Placebo 10 consecutive day . Screening Part B may begin PK analysis Part A . Part A subject enroll Part B sponsor approval . Drug administration precede light breakfast consume within 1 hour prior dose . All drug administer study staff . In order maintain blinding , subject receive two tablet dose , accord follow administration : - Cohort D : 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet ( 12 subject ) - Cohort E : 1 x 200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet ( 12 subject ) - Cohort F : 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Placebo tablet ( 8 subject ) Subjects admit in-house even first study drug administration ( Day 0 ) remain in-house 24 36 hour first ( Day 1 ) last ( Day 10 ) dos , respectively ; subject return visit . PK blood sample draw Day 1 24 hour designate time point describe . Additionally , pre-dose ( trough ) sample draw dose Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 . On Day 10 , blood sample collect 36 hour designate time point describe additional visit 48 , 96 , 120 , 144 , 168 192 hour post-dose . Subjects continuously monitor safety . An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit take place last PK sample day , ie , 192 hour last dose administration .</detailed_description>
