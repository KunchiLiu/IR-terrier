	<brief_summary>Antiphospholipid ( APL ) antibodies heterogeneous family auto-antibodies , predominantly represent anticardiolipin ( ACL ) antibodies lupus anticoagulant ( LA ) . Antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) define presence APL associate venous and/or arterial thrombosis repeat foetal loss . APS may either primary secondary autoimmune disease , mainly systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . However , context APS , APL also observe various clinical situation healthy subject . Published study report variable prevalence APL healthy subject , essentially ACL and/or LA , clinical significance currently remain unclear . Several study highlight link APL atherosclerosis . It therefore appear interest specifically study association presence APL presence cardiovascular risk factor population healthy subject . Atherosclerosis currently consider chronic inflammatory disease arise complex interaction atherogenic plasma factor cell arterial wall . Several inflammatory marker know associated cardiovascular risk . Lipid peroxidation also play major role atherogenesis process . It therefore also important correlate APL marker vascular inflammation marker oxidative stress . A prospective case-control study therefore conduct 1,500 healthy blood donor . Subjects screen APL-positive compare APL-negative subject term cardiovascular risk factor ( cardiovascular risk per se , presence cardiovascular disease study ) . In context blood donation , subject wish participate study attend medical interview clinical examination various data collect , mainly presence cardiovascular risk factor . A blood sample also take assay various laboratory marker study . This study provide good understanding role APL healthy subject clearly specify possible link atherosclerosis population .</brief_summary>
