	<brief_summary>About 15 % couple consult difficulty achieve pregnancy . In two-thirds case , male component identify , always sufficient explain infertility . In majority case , cause clearly identify multiple abnormality may detect partner . Many factor concern lifestyle environment ( medication , alcohol , smoking , pollution , exposure heat , toxin , xenobiotic oestrogen , etc . ) may impact fertility . These factor may also impact fertility child conceive , describe intergenerational effect ( alteration fertility boy expose smoke utero ) . Few scientific study high level proof publish impact smoke couple 's fertility . Gonadal function quality gamete alter environmental factor , may trigger process apoptosis alteration DNA gamete ( sperm DNA fragmentation ) . Other modification include DNA methylation histone acetylation , control gene expression group term epigenetic modification . More recently , oestrogens show involved male reproductive function act spermatogenesis , spermiogenesis epididymal maturation . Demonstration active aromatase ( Arom ) ( mRNA , protein activity ) ejaculate human spermatozoon suggest synthesis small quantity oestrogens spermatozoon . The study transcript profile could provide information quality spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis first step embryonic development . Confocal microscopy colocalized aromatase head , midpiece tail use assess quality acrosome anti-CD-46 monoclonal antibody . Even low concentration xenobiotic oestrogen exert biological effect certain function murine human spermatozoon , accelerate capacitation acrosome reaction . These factor effective act combination , human gamete appear sensitive action murine gametes All study conduct date investigate impact toxins either one partner child born couple . No detailed high-level scientific study study partner quality embryo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Amiens University Hospital Cytogenetic , CECOS Reproduction Biology , assist reproductive technology department collaboration Caen University Hospital ( member G4 ) want conduct type routine clinical practice follow-up study context inter-regional research grant ( PHRC ) . These 2 University Hospitals situate agricultural region potential polluting industry . The recruitment centre comprise young couple present infertility cause always demonstrate percentage ART ICSI high national average ( close 75 % vs 60 % ) . This population also present high cancer risk region . This research project concern evaluation impact male smoke couple 's fertility consist two-centre case-control study .</detailed_description>
