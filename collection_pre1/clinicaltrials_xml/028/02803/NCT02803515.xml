	<brief_summary>Peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC ) stage III FIGO ovarian cancer stag . It correspond advanced stage relative 5 year survival rate 52 % . The multimodal treatment approach combine neoadjuvant chemotherapy , cytoreductive surgery macroscopic lesion , hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) . It significantly improve survival rate patient ovarian PC decrease recurrence mortality rate 21 % . The efficacy HIPEC base chemotherapy potentiate hyperthermia ( 43Â° ) . However , cellular mechanism involve fully understood , include cell death pathways heat shock protein ( Hsp70 Hsp90 ) . RICCI et al . show , base pre-clinical model , efficacy HIPEC partly due overexpression exposure HSP90 cell surface lead anti-cancer immune response . The aim study validate finding tissue sample patient ovarian PC . We constitute bank isolated tumor sample HIPEC measure postoperative HSP90 serum level order establish predictive response . HSPs expression cancer cell surface determine flow cytometry . Forty-four patient include . Elucidating underlying mechanism HIPEC broaden therapeutic possibility include use new immunotherapy . The multimodal approach could improve efficacy HIPEC minimal systemic toxicity .</brief_summary>
