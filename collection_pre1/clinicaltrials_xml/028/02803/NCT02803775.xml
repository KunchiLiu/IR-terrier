	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) well establish clinical therapy patient symptomatic leave ventricular systolic dysfunction electrocardiographic QRS duration 120 m great . Multicenter trial consistently demonstrate CRT `` non responder '' rate 32-43 % 6 month . Subsequent study show utilizing echocardiographic-guided device reprogramming optimal atrio-ventricular ( A-V ) interventricular ( VV ) delay rest improve clinical response . Recently , echocardiographically validate automated pacemaker programmer-based intra-cardiac electrogram ( IEGM ) algorithm develop rapid optimization sino-ventricular ( P-V ) , A-V V-V delay rest heart rate partially base interventricular conduction time delay . Nevertheless , controversy still persist applicability echocardiographic IEGM derive algorithms elevated heart rate , physical activity , patient likely experience symptom related poor cardiac output . Recent study show clinical benefit pace site late intrinsic activation intra-ventricular conduction delay ( IVCD ) . Some study utilize intrinsic SENSED IVCD method others use right ventricle ( RV ) -PACED IVCD . There study date compare method determine one may yield good clinical outcome lower non-responder rate . This study predict RV pace IVCD method provide good clinical outcome long RV sense IVCD determine clinical composite score . The study prospective double blind study additional cross-over group consist non-responders compare clinical response 72 patient receive CRT therapy . After successful CRT-D implantation hospital discharge patient randomly assign 1:1 fashion Group 1 ( SENSED ) Group 2 ( PACED ) . The patient complete Minnesota Living Heart Failure questionnaire , compare echocardiographic data assess blinded nurse physician prior discharge follow visit maintain double blind design . After 3 month follow-up , non-responders group crossed-over group follow additional 3 month . Clinical data collect end 3 month compare look change symptom , ejection fraction ( EF ) echocardiographic measurement , New York Heart Assocation Function Class ( NYHA ) class , clinical composite score ( CCC ) , device interrogation data hospital admission two group see statistical difference .</brief_summary>
