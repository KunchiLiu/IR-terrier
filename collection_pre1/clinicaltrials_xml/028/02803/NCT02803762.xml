	<brief_summary>This study open-label , absorption , metabolism , excretion , mass balance study 400 mg [ 14C ] pacritinib ( contain 100 Î¼Ci radioactivity ) administer orally single dose 6 healthy male subject follow least 10-hour fast ( include water ) Day 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigate Absorption , Metabolism , Excretion , Mass Balance Pacritinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study design investigate absorption , metabolism , excretion well safety/tolerability pacritinib follow administration single oral dose healthy male volunteer . The pacritinib dose administer [ 14C ] -labeled form enable detection quantitation dose-related material independent possible biotransformation . The study design allow detection potential human specific metabolite detect animal specie . Subjects confine clinical site time Check-in Day 14 post-dose , may discharge clinical site Day 10 13 post-dose study discharge criterion meet ( i.e . completion sufficient radioactivity excretion ) . All remain subject discharge clinical site Day 14 post-dose irrespective study discharge criterion . The data obtain study use clinical development compound .</detailed_description>
