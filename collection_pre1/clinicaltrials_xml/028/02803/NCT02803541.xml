	<brief_summary>Purpose : Most child adolescent chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) much less physical endurance age match peer , high risk premature cardiovascular disease , poor self image part due limit peer contact . Sustained exercise adult CKD improve endurance decrease cardiovascular risk . Minimal data exists pediatric CKD patient . This study show whether 12 day increase exercise summer camp improve endurance measure distance walk 6 minute self concept measure short standardize questionaire ( Harter scale ) . The study occur Frost Valley YMCA Catskills 2 , 12 day session total 25-30 kidney camper mainstreamed general camp population 500 . Mainstreaming mean kidney camper live cabin 8-10 age match peer participate much possible camp activity bunkmates . The kidney program Frost Valley provide hemo peritoneal dialysis , well care child less advanced CKD post transplant . Participants activity measure duringcamp wear pedometer . The distance walk 6 minute ( 6 minutewalk test ) measure onset completion 12 day camp experience . A standardized questionaire self concept also administer onset completion camp .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Children adolescents CKD high rate hospitalization , End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) remain life expectancy 20 year increase risk premature death due cardiovascular disease . Most much less physical endurance age match peer degree underperformance loosely correlated severity renal disease . Cardiovascular disease , chronic inflammation , anemia , low muscular strength and/or bone disease among factor consider responsible poor physical conditioning . However , investigator hypothesize important cause inactivity cause vary combination parental 'protection ' , limited poor peer inaction , patient choice . In addition , child require chronic hemodialysis enforce 10-14 hour weekly enforce inactivity . Cardiovascular morbidity commonly associate chronic kidney disease physical endurance measure cardiovascular health . In addition many child chronic kidney disease demonstrate poor self-concept , part relate lack physical endurance limit peer contact . Multiple study adults chronic kidney disease document poor physical conditioning function . Over past decade , many study demonstrate adult CKD significant benefit regular exercise physical fitness , walk capacity , blood pressure , health relate quality life . Several small study show modest improvement child adolescent CKD study high drop-out rate problematic compliance . A 2012 study Akber et al use pedometer measurement show 7 day period , child , adolescent , young adult CKD ( n=44 ) average walk 50 % le expect use data collect NHANES standard . Females walk less male old child less active young child . On 6 minute walk test , male score &lt; 2 standard deviation expect mean female &lt; 4 standard deviation mean . There measure difference stage CKD , dialysis , transplant status . In 1975 Ruth Gottscho Kidney Foundation partner Albert Einstein College Medicine Frost Valley YMCA develop first summer camp program capable perform hemodialysis care child chronic kidney disease . One guiding principles program kidney camper ( well child chronic illness ) mainstreamed general camp population participate activity age match peer . Each summer , 4 two week camp session 500 camper attend session . The program run summer since 1975 , enrollment kidney camper vary 25 50 summer . The Frost Valley YMCA locate Catskill Mountains approximately 120 mile New York City spread 2000 acre . Informal observation kidney camper indicate many show improve physical endurance camp stay , study do early program 's history demonstrate improved self-esteem . , A study use Piers Harris test self-concept evaluate 24 chronic dialysis child Summer 1976 compare 76 regular camper . On arrival camp dialysis camper low self-concept regular camper ( P &lt; .01 ) . The child evaluate end camp . Both group improve self-concept ( P &lt; 0.02 ) dialysis camper show great improvement . ( P &lt; 0.01 ) This study present 1977 Clinical Dialysis Transplant Forum . The investigator hypothesize time camp kidney camper improve physical endurance self-concept ; assess objectively physical fitness/function psychometric assessment . The investigator hope way interferes little possible camp experience yet educational fun kidney camper peer . The ultimate objective pilot study increase awareness child CKD physically active , enjoy part program peer , may benefit physically mentally . METHODS : This pilot study design close collaboration UNC Kidney Center UNC Department Exercise Science occur first two 12 day camp session Frost Valley YMCA Summer 2016 . Campers range age 8 17 year . Each kidney camper age match healthy control ( bunkmate ) provide pedometer camp arrival ask wear throughout day week camp order record physical activity level . Participants also ask record screen time week prior begin camp . Participants ask wear pedometer camp stay , except waterfront activity , data record . The investigator hope enroll kidney camper ( estimate 25-40 individual ) approximately 70-100 control camper . The Omron 321 pedometer choose retain seven-days data , inexpensive , previously show valid reliable indicator physical activity . On day , first day camp arrival , kidney camper along his/her bunkmate ask complete 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . A standardized chart self-report perceive exertion end walk use . Pulse upon completion 6MWT 1 minute later measure . Each child wear portable pulse oximeter walk . The investigator hypothesize kidney camper increase activity camp compare activity home measure pedometer , also able ambulate measure 6MWT less perceive exertion possibly low post 6MWT pulse rate end camp session compare begin camp . The 6MWT test choose primary test measurement consultation Exercise Science Department faculty camp administrative staff considerable normative data healthy child , non-invasive , administration easily fit camp program . Having kidney camper participate bunkmate 6MWT provide motivation camper perform high level possible , yet single kidney camper special specifically research subject . Research data collect camper consent/assent obtain . Similarly , data control camper instructive whether relatively short period increase activity ( 12 day ) allow measure change 6MWT . In order time efficient fit camp environment , rather standard 6MWT classically do hallway 2 cone separate 20 meter , camper walk ( run ) along camp circle approximately laundry area Biscuit Hall ( modify 6MWT ) . This relatively level pave path ( net elevation rise ~15 foot ) 1500 foot distance estimate take average camper 6 minute . Any reach Biscuit Hall earlier , lap around Biscuit 6 minute . The course carefully measure marked distance achieve accurately ascertain . The 6MWT repeat identical fashion shortly end camp session , approximately time day . Any child becomes unusually fatigue modified 6MWT , encourage rest ready continue . A short standardize survey measure self-concept give kidney camper control camper complete upon arrival shortly prior leave camp use Harter Self Perception Profile Children ( SPPC ) . Camp physical form use determine age , weight , height control camper directly measure kidney camper . STATISTICS The primary data collect distance travel 6MWT . Each child serve his/her control pair t-test analysis . Secondary data , emphasize kidney camper , perceive exertion self concept . In group , possible , correlation draw activity level prior camp , performance 6MWT , measurement self-concept . Also , group analyse do comparison previously publish standard data . As pilot project little data exists activity level child kidney disease similar study ever do , difficult predict change activity see . Consequently power calculation provide . Similarly , study exercise use period considerably longer 12 day , possible 12 day insufficient see measureable change 6MWT . Although camper bunk village ask participate 6MWT , data camper whose family provide consent camper provide assent use analysis . If sufficient non-kidney camper participate , data analyze similar manner measure impact camp experience physical fitness self-concept . In situation , data regard screen time pre camp well pedometer measurement pre-camp may instructive .</detailed_description>
