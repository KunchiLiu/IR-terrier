	<brief_title>Is There Association Between Vitamin D Levels And Insulin Resistance In Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common gynecological endocrinopathy among woman reproductive age . The prevalence PCOS among woman estimate 6.4 % 6.8 % worldwide . PCOS heterogeneous androgen excess disorder different degree reproductive metabolic dysfunction . There many consideration explain complexity underlying pathogenesis PCOS , particularly well-known role hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal dysfunction , metabolic abnormality genetic factor , developmental model chronic disease postulate early-life event affect individual difference vulnerability lifestyle environment , suggest hostile intrauterine environment low birth weight may predispose development early adrenarche , PCOS metabolic syndrome later life ; however , definite pathogenesis real underlying etiology PCOS remain uncertain ripe opportunity research . PCOS common cause anovulatory infertility , foremost clinical symptom include anovulation oligo-ovulation , infertility , menstrual irregularity , polycystic ovary , hyperandrogenism woman without specific underlie disease adrenal pituitary gland . A primary abnormality folliculogenesis may play role development PCOS . The polycystic ovary contain multiple antral follicle , prematurely acquire LH receptor become responsive LH , increase granulosa cell proliferation preantral follicle , result anovulation . PCOS define presence least 2 follow criterion : irregular absent ovulation , elevate level androgenic hormone , enlarge ovary contain least 12 follicle . Several epidemiological interventional PCOS study demonstrate serum vitamin D concentration inversely associate fast plasma glucose level , insulin resistance , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat contribute pathogenesis PCOS promote insulin resistance affect glucose metabolism PCOS woman . Vitamin D either produce skin response direct exposure sunlight dehydrocholesterol obtain diet . Vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 principally liver 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 kidney two hydroxylation step . 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 active form vitamin D , bind vitamin D receptor ( VDRs ) express 2776 genomic position modulate expression 229 gene 30 different tissue , skeleton , pancreatic islet cell , parathyroid gland , ovary . About 3 % human genome regulate VDRs gene include responsible glucose fat metabolism well blood regulation ; 's active form act VDRs either directly regulation intercellular calcium facilitate insulin secretion . It suggest Vitamin D increase insulin sensitivity effect muscle cell receptor increase insulin receptor increase insulin sensitivity insulin receptor insulin . Also , fat soluble vitamin , high proportion vitamin D may sequester adipose tissue obese individual , result low 25- ( OH ) D3 concentration level ; therefore , low vitamin D status suspect risk factor impair glucose tolerance , insulin resistance substantial cause obesity . In light literature , relationship vitamin D status insulin glucose metabolism investigate woman PCOS vitamin D deficient , although consensus whether serum vitamin D level different woman without PCOS . Vitamin D level define serum level 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [ 25- ( OH ) D3 ] . Vitamin D insufficiency define 25- ( OH ) D3 concentration &lt; 30ng/ml frank vitamin D deficiency define 25- ( OH ) D3 concentration &lt; 20ng/ml . There appear grow disconnect observational study randomize clinical trial vitamin D supplementation PCOS woman insulin resistance glucose intolerance . Observational study keep show fairly consistent relationship low concentration level vitamin D insulin resistance glucose intolerance , almost randomize trial , include meta-analysis vitamin D supplementation woman suffer PCOS show minimal , , benefit term correct insulin resistance increase insulin sensitivity index improvement glucose metabolism . The result publish indicated change significant show difference insulin resistance core patho-physiology syndrome . Vitamin D deficiency ( VDD ) common woman without PCOS may associate metabolic endocrine disorder PCOS . However , phenotypic manifestation PCOS associate various degree gonadotropic and/or metabolic abnormality much debate whether represent single disorder several determine interaction multiple genetic environmental factor . Previously conduct prospective observational study investigate temporal relationship VDD metabolic disturbance ( resistance action insulin glucose intolerance ) PCOS lack . If VDD causally related PCOS subsequent development metabolic dysfunction PCOS , prospective observational study repeat VDD assessment good characterization PCOS disease severity enrollment need clarify whether VDD co-determinant metabolic dysregulations PCOS compare Non-PCOS woman ( control ) . Study design : A prospective observational study conduct outpatient clinic Ain Shams University Women 's Hospital approve local ethical committee . Sample size justification : For sample size determination , investigator use follow formula : N= 2 x K x [ SD/μ1-μ2 ] 2 N equal number patient per arm K constant ( K=7.9 ) set type-1 error α 0.5 power β 80 % . Results previous study calculate mean ( standard deviation ( SD ) ) vitamin Din PCOS group ( μ1 ) 15.45 ± 7.88 ng/ml control group ( μ2 ) 12.83 ± 5.76ng/ml . Anticipating 10 % drop rate , calculate sample size 83 subject group , total 166 subject enough detect significant difference , exist . Objectives : 1 . To measure plasma concentration vitamin D , fast glucose , fast Insulin , androgen level , FSH LH level participant diagnose PCOS healthy participant . 2 . To clarify whether VDD co-determinant metabolic dysregulations particularly insulin resistance glucose metabolism PCOS compare healthy woman ( control ) . 3 . To develop well assessment PCOS severity factor involve . Methodology : All recruited subject undergo : - Written consent . - Complete history particular emphasis menstrual , sexual , gynecological , medical ( Irregular cycle , oligomenorrhea , polymenorrhea , secondary amenorrhea , dysmenorrhea primary secondary infertility , cancer , thyroid disease , galactorrhea , hirsutism , pelvic pain ... etc ) , previous pelvic surgery , induction ovulation , vaginal infection , abnormal Pap smear , life style habit alcohol smoking . - Physical examination include general examination , Anthropometric measurement like weight ( kg ) , height ( meter ) , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , waist hip ratio ( WHR ) , Waist circumference ( midway low rib margin iliac crest ) hip circumference ( wide part gluteal region ) . Signs androgen excess , thyroid toxicity , galactorrhea examine . Patients undergo gynecological ultrasound follicular phase ass ovarian size morphology . Local examination exclude uterine abnormality , cervical tenderness , mass , vaginal infection discharge . - Diagnostic test : Overnight fast venous blood sample withdraw 2nd 3rd day menstruation , withdrawal bleed follow progesterone therapy 5 day amenorheic woman , centrifuge frozen -80 C analyze assessment vitamin D level , Androgen level , plasma Glucose plasma Insulin , FSH LH analogue . All collect data tabulate statistically analyze . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic measure variable express range , mean standard deviation ( metric data ) ; range , median interquartile range ( discrete data ) ; number proportion ( categorical data ) . Demographic data , primary secondary outcome woman compare use t-test ( quantitative parametric measure ) , Mann-Whitney 's U-test ( quantitative non-parametric measure ) chi-squared Fisher 's Exact test ( categorical measure ) . Pearson 's correlation coefficient ( metric variable ) Spearman 's correlation coefficient ( rank variable ) use estimate association variable . Microsoft Excel SPSS Windows use data presentation statistical analysis . Ethical consideration : The clinical research study conduct accordance mention design , safety reporting case match relevant policy , requirement , regulation Ethical Committee Department Obstetrics Gynecology - Faculty Medicine , Ain Shams University Women 's Hospital . Consent procedure : The investigator make certain appropriate inform consent process place ensure potential research subject , authorize representative , fully inform nature objectives clinical study , benefit study participation right research subject . The investigator obtain write , sign informed consent subject , subject 's authorized representative , prior perform study-specific procedure subject . The investigator retain original sign informed consent form . Subject confidentiality : All evaluation form , report record leave site include unique personal data maintain subject confidentiality .</detailed_description>
