	<brief_title>Circulatory Management Acute Kidney Injury Patients Undergoing Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study find incidence acute kidney injury afer partial nephrectomy high 30 % . In addition nephron loss induce renal parenchyma resection , ischemia/reperfusion injury produce clamping/unclamping renal artery also important reason . However , study investigate effect circulatory management incidence acute kidney injury partial nephrectomy limit . It show perioperative hemodynamic optimization protect renal function surgical patient . And patient undergoing renal transplantation , adequate hydration optimal perfusion enhances early graft function . The investigator hypothesize hydration circulatory management guarantee optimal renal perfusion may decrease occurrence acute kidney injury partial nephrectomy . The purpose study investigate whether circulatory management base LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitoring reduce incidence acute kidney injury patient undergo partial nephrectomy compare routine circulatory management base blood pressure urine output monitoring .</detailed_description>
