	<brief_summary>This study aim test hypothesis cardiogoniometry ( CGM ) helpful identify site culprit vessel patient NSTEMI comparison 12-lead ECG . NSTEMI constitute clinical syndrome subset acute coronary syndrome usually cause atherosclerotic coronary artery disease . It define `` electrocardiographic ( ECG ) ST-segment depression prominent T-wave inversion and/or positive biomarkers necrosis ( e.g. , troponin ) absence ST-segment elevation appropriate clinical setting ( chest discomfort angina equivalent ) '' . The standard 12 lead ECG commonly sensitive localise site culprit lesion even coronary angiography may always helpful majority lesion angiographically evident thrombus . Patients ACS may multivessel disease often possible identify precise site culprit lesion . In patient multivessel disease , interventionists frequently target severe stenosis even though necessarily acute lesion . CGM ( Cardiogoniometry cardiologic explorer , Enverdis GmbH medical solution , Germany ) form 3D vector electrocardiography provide quantitative analysis myocardial depolarisation repolarisation . It CE mark show sensitive specific standard 12-lead ECG diagnose stable coronary artery disease . Furthermore , recent work show CGM sensitive detecting patient NSTEMI conventional 12-lead ECG In summary , evidence CGM efficacious 12-lead ECG diagnosis stable CAD ACS . The hope clinical application extend localise ischaemia culprit vessel valuable diagnostic aid . The primary objective study investigate efficacy CGM identify culprit vessel patient present NSTEMI . Secondary endpoint evaluate efficacy CGM detect significant coronary stenosis ( define â‰¥70 % ) compare standard 12-lead ECG</brief_summary>
