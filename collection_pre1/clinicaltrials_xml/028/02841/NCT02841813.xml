	<brief_summary>The incidence preterm birth increase annually . Premature delivery become lead cause neonatal illness death . For survived premature baby , incidence sequela also high full-term baby , bring heavy burden family society . Preterm birth become important factor affect quality birth . The occurrence premature birth outcome combine action genetic environmental factor . However , etiology clear . Recent study show risk preterm birth associate dietary factor . Choline essential nutrient human health play important role growth development fetuses neonate . The investigator previously find serum level free choline preterm mother low normal mother full-term birth . Serum level free choline also reduce preterms receive parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . However , relationship choline preterm birth clear . Therefore , study aim explore effect choline intake pregnancy genetic polymorphism risk preterm birth clinical outcome preterms receive total PN therapy . Healthy Chinese pregnant woman healthy term infant recruit control group , Chinese woman preterm delivery preterm infant recruit preterm group . Dietary choline intake pregnancy evaluate semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire 24-h dietary recall questionnaire . Gene polymorphisms key enzyme choline metabolism identify among participated woman neonates Real-time polymerase chain reaction . Choline related metabolite assay use high performance liquid chromatography combine mass spectrometry among mother preterms 7-days PN treatment . The influence genetic risk factor metabolic change choline physical mental development preterms evaluate . The result study contribute comprehensive understanding role choline relative gene polymorphism risk preterm birth , helpful estimate high risk advance . The result also provide scientific evidence establish personalize amount choline intake among woman infant , optimize nutrition support pregnant woman preterms , promote good prenatal postnatal care .</brief_summary>
