	<brief_title>Osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) First-line Locally Advanced Metastatic NSCLC Patients With EGFR EGFR T790M</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Naïve patient ≥ 18 year age histological confirmation locally advance metastatic , non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) activate EGFR mutation concomitant T790M mutation . Evidence measurable evaluable metastatic disease require . Primary objective : - To evaluate efficacy osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) , term objective response rate patient advance non-squamous NSCLC EGFR mutation EGFR T790M mutation diagnosis define RECIST 1.1 criterion . Secondary objective : - To determine safety tolerability profile osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) , measure use number severity AEs enter Case Report Form ( CRF ) ; chemistry , blood count , vital sign , physical examination , weight , ECG performance status ( S ) . - To determine efficacy parameter progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , time treatment failure ( TTF ) , duration response ( DOR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , tumor shrinkage ( TS ) . - To correlate parameter clinical response efficacy document EGFR mutational status . - To carry longitudinal analysis EGFR mutation ( include T790M mutation ) plasma serum . - To determine level BIM mRNA well mRNA level biomarkers related EGFR TKI response determine whether predictor treatment response . - To identify mechanism acquire resistance osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) ; mutation site covalent bind drug ( C797 ) mutation tissue blood . Type study : Multicenter , international , single-arm , open-label , non-controlled phase IIa clinical study . Treatment : Patients treat 1 tablet osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) 80 mg per o ( p.o . ) daily .</detailed_description>
