	<brief_summary>More patient diabetes mellitus lead increase rate chronic non-healing wound . These wound colonise pathogen , include multi-drug resistant organism . Despite repeated course antibiotic subsequent management difficult due devascularisation surround tissue heal failure . Ultimately , patient may require amputation . Electrolysed water novel antiseptic produce pass electric current mixture tap water salt . Microbiocidal activity due presence hypochlorous acid neutral Ph . Irrigation chronic wound electrolysed water reduces bacterial load appear encourage wound heal . Following encourage pilot study , propose compare electrolysed water conventional management diabetic patient non-healing foot ulcer . Adult diabetic chronic ulcer attend podiatry Hairmyres Hospital recruit receive regular debridement irrigation wound use either in-use product ( Prontosan™ ) electrolysed water part prospective randomise controlled trial . Strict enrolment criterion apply , regular clinical assessment microbiological screening . Lesions present &gt; 6 week &gt; 2cm photograph trial entry grade use standardise criterion . Wounds monitor least 12 week ( max . 20 ) , primary composite end-point define complete healing ; &gt; 50 % heal initial lesion ; and/or avoidance surgical intervention . Secondary endpoint surgical intervention , include debridement amputation ; antibiotic therapy ; and/or patient death . The main objective compare rapidity wound heal use either in-use product electrolysed water . Improved healing could potentially benefit patient might otherwise progress amputation . We also monitor antimicrobial consumption study patient throughout trial . A final objective cost use electrolysed water v cost Prontosan routine management diabetic foot ulcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The entrance criterion specify adult diabetic patient ( 18-65 year ) chronic ( &gt; 6 week ) non-healing wound ( &gt; 2cm2 ) identify study clinician counsel aid Participant Information sheet ( PIS ) . Having consider PIS &gt; 24hrs , patient wish participate provide sign formal consent enter trial . Relevant demographic clinical data record baseline microbiology , blood test classification wound pain score . Wounds graded accord Texas classification photograph . Pain score entry measure modify McGill questionnaire grade 0 ( pain ) 5 ( severe pain ) . Study patient randomly assign receive either in-use product electrolysed water accord predetermine statistical protocol give code continue identification . The patient 's note tag study code information , copy send patient 's GP . The wound inspect , debrided , clean irrigate twice week use electrolysed water in-use product ( Prontosan™ ) . In-patients may receive frequent application ( e.g . daily ) depend upon wound status . This perform ward nurse in-patients outpatient podiatrist Diabetic clinic . Patients assessed podiatrist weekly ( &lt; =20wks ) agree end-point reach ; research assessment coincide routine outpatient clinic attendance in-patient review minimise patient inconvenience . Release electrolysed water coordinate research scientist . Supplies decant identical container order blind staff product identity . The bottle label ' A ' ' B . Patients randomise receive study in-use irrigant continue product , initially assign . If patient develops infection , receive clinical review microbiological screening . These patient continue trial irrigants offer appropriate antibiotic accord laboratory data . They encourage complete trial data analyse separately final analysis . Patients underlie terminal disease exclude trial along patient severe co-morbidities , e.g . morbidly obese ; uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1c &gt; 97 mmol/mol ) ; gangrene ; chronic leg oedema/venous disease ; end-stage renal disease ; untreatable ischaemic heart disease ; HIV ; etc . Patients ongoing infection trial entry treat reassessed . Any previous document allergy either Prontosan™ electrolysed water also necessitate exclusion . Any adverse effect think due either irrigant prompt study withdrawal investigation . If doubt continuation correctly assign irrigant specific patient , patient 's data label noted final analysis . This also case and/or lapse 4 treatment session therapy . All data retain final project report . The primary composite end-points : complete healing ; &gt; 50 % heal initial lesion ; and/or avoidance surgical intervention include amputation . Secondary endpoint : surgical debridement include amputation ; antibiotic consumption ; patient death . Each patient lesion photograph agree end-point .</detailed_description>
