	<brief_title>Ursodeoxycholic Acid Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal detachment consist separation neuroretina retinal pigment epithelium . The common form rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD ) , occur result full-thickness retinal break presence vitreoretinal traction . Photoreceptor cell death occur rapidly RRD ultimate cause vision loss patient . Reattachment retina surgical procedure allow recovery vision . However , degree visual recovery differs among patient , despite successful reattachment . This mainly related preoperative visual acuity level , presence macular detachment duration . Predicting factor worse visual acuity height retinal detachment macula presence edema , separation , cyst undulation level outer nuclear layer show optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Most patient usually consult RRD already involve macular area 3 day , lead bad visual prognostic even successful surgery . The need adjuvant neuroprotective agent critical improve photoreceptor survival , functional recovery subsequent quality life patient affect RRD . Tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDCA ) taurine conjugate ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) , secondary bile acid produce intestinal bacteria . UDCA approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment cholestatic liver disease . Both UDCA TUDCA potent inhibitor apoptosis , part interfere upstream mitochondrial pathway cell death , inhibit oxygen-radical production , reduce endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , stabilize unfolded protein response ( UPR ) . TUDCA propose anti-apoptotic agent several neurodegenerative disease , include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , Huntington 's disease . In certain degenerative retinal disorder , retinitis pigmentosa , TUDCA play important role prevent cell death . In animal model RRD , systemic treatment TUDCA show protect photoreceptors cell death . The aim study determine whether detectable level UDCA reach vitreous cavity administer orally different time point surgery RRD , analyze ocular safety . 20 patient present rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 4 day duration prospectively include . A single dose ursodeoxycholic acid administer orally surgery different time-points 16 subject . Standard surgery perform ocular sample collect procedure . Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment continue treated patient 3 month surgery .</detailed_description>
