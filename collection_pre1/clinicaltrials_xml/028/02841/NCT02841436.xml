	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer one important malignancy high mortality world . The prognosis patient poor . Although patient early-diagnosed disease could receive surgical intervention , majority ( 70 % 80 % ) patient present locally advance metastatic status inoperable . Patients late status usually recommend receive palliative bypass operation choledochojejunostomy and/or gastrojejunostomy palliative radiotherapy pancreatic cancer . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) use expect alternative therapy . However , main drawback RFA side effect damage adjacent structure bile duct , tumor locate adjacent vessel could ablate well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Research About Using Irreversible Electroporation Treat Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) , develop manufacture AngioDynamics US Ltd , ablate tumor fenestrating cancer cell membrane electric pulse . The anti-tumor effect result thermotherapy , also diminish adjacent vessel . Several pre-clinical clinical study already demonstrate IRE safe effective treatment , adjacent tissue vessel ductal structure spar . Recently , IRE use treat pancreatic cancer successfully , safety satisfactory . The system approve safe European Union ( EU ) 2008 receive Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval 2010 . However , still experience use IRE tumor ablation Taiwan . In study , investigator perform IRE inoperable patient locally advance pancreatic cancer . They receive IRE operation palliative bypass operation include choledochojejunostomy and/or gastrojejunostomy . The investigator evaluate potential side effect ablate effect tumor , also follow-up patient 2 year evaluate overall survival . The investigator appraisal clinical feasibility advantage system study .</detailed_description>
