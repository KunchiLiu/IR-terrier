	<brief_title>Hydrothermal Ablation Recurrent Chronic Symptomatic Bursitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , exploratory , 6-months dose-tolerance dose-response study single thermal ablation ( Ablaflex ) procedure subject suffer chronic symptomatic bursitis . Possible study participant screen eligibility base defined inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible patient administer single 3-minute perfusion physiological saline solution specific temperature 50° Celsius 55° Celsius . If volume bursa estimate ultrasound examination ≤ 10 cc , perfusion perform rate 3mL/second . If volume bursa &gt; 10 cc ≤ 25 cc , perfusion perform rate 4mL/second . If volume bursa &gt; 25 cc , subject consider screen failure ( exclusion criterion # 10 ) . Immediately prior immediately thermal ablation phase 3 minute , perfusion physiological saline solution room temperature ( 22°C ) perform 2 minute . In total bursa rinse 7 minute . An elastic bandage ( Elastoplast ) apply immediately procedure compress bursa cavity . It wear 6 week . The first patient bursitis olecranon administer physiological saline solution temperature 50° Celsius , subsequent patient receive perfusion increment 0.5 1° Celsius long AR ( intensity ) report . As long AR report , first CR PR report specific temperature , patient CR PR report consider first cohort 3 patient treated temperature course clinical trial . As soon first AR report , patient AR report consider first cohort 3 patient treated temperature remainder study conduct cohort 3 patient treated condition . Patients assess 6 different study visit : baseline ( Day 1 ) , 1 day ( 24/72h ) treatment , 1 week treatment ( +/- 1 day ) , 3 week treatment ( +/- 2 day ) , 6 week ( +/- 1 week ) treatment , 6 month ( +/- 2 week ) treatment . At time 6-months study period unscheduled visit may perform . Patients request score weekly patient report outcome assessment ( PRO ) Week 6 Month 6 , record possible ARs bursitis related treatment . At Week 2 , Week 4 Week 5 patient complete PRO home . Assessments perform every study visit include : physical examination ( focus bursitis ) , vital sign ( include HR temperature ) , PRO , adverse event ( AE ) , concomitant medication ( ) treatment ( ) . An ultrasound exam bursa ( accord standard ultrasound protocol ) perform baseline week 6 ( week 1 assessment optional ) .</detailed_description>
