	<brief_summary>For last 70 year , orthopaedic dogma dictate injury penetrate joint capsule require formal irrigation debridement operate room minimize risk develop septic complication . The literature support practice sparse stem primarily wartime injury may generalizable small , less contaminated arthrotomies see civilian population . Despite classical teaching traumatic arthrotomies require irrigation , debridement , closure operating room , numerous surgeon around country begin treat small traumatic arthrotomies without surgery .

	<brief_title>Operative Non-operative Treatment Traumatic Arthrotomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Soft tissue wound around joint common injury carefully evaluate identify intra-articular extension . Wound exploration , imaging , intra-articular saline load injection commonly utilize diagnose presence traumatic arthrotomy . The reason diligence treatment dramatically different wound violate joint compare one . As opposed local wound care simple soft tissue wound , traumatic arthrotomies think require formal irrigation debridement operate room minimize risk develop septic arthritis . Septic Joints An injury penetrates joint capsule synovium violate body 's natural barrier protect joint external pathogen . Microorganisms environment may enter joint direct inoculation contiguous spread perforate barrier . By bring patient operate room formal irrigation debridement , orthopaedic surgeon theoretically attempt minimize burden contamination repair body 's natural barrier reduce risk develop intra-articular infection . Septic arthritis orthopaedic emergency result severe cartilage damage cause long-term joint pain , stiffness , potentially auto-fusion . If dealt timely manner , intra-articular infection result significant long-term disability , extreme case , result overwhelming sepsis death . Orthopaedic Dogma Clearly , minimize risk develop septic arthritis important every orthopaedic surgeon . Over sixty year ago , observation high rate septic complication combat injury violate joint . Since , orthopaedic dogma dictate injury violate joint necessitate formal irrigation debridement order minimize risk infectious complication . The literature topic sparse stem primarily wartime observation injury sustain commonly associate high level contamination , intra-articular fracture , retain foreign body , delay treatment . The characteristic injury may limit generalizability observation civilian population , especially small , mildly contaminated arthrotomies without associated fracture retain foreign body . To date , study prospectively evaluate benefit operative irrigation debridement traumatic arthrotomies compare non-operative observation antibiotic . A single study publish show patient open joint injury treat operative irrigation debridement infection rate 2.1 % , value significantly low previously observe non-operative cohort combat injury . There little question large heavily contaminate arthrotomies benefit formal irrigation debridement , unclear benefit extrapolate small , less contaminated injury . Nevertheless , orthopaedic surgeon continue debride irrigate open joint regardless burden contamination size arthrotomy . Small Arthrotomies Commonly Missed Injuries In effort identify treat many traumatic arthrotomies possible , orthopaedic surgeon begin look additional technique aid diagnosis . After 's introduction 1975 , saline arthrogram quickly become gold standard diagnosis small traumatic arthrotomies . This doctrine call question show saline load arthrogram , commonly perform , sensitivity 43 % . Two year later , recommend use 155-ml saline diagnose 95 % arthrotomies , volume double previous use clinical practice easily tolerate patient . Most recently , study show false-negative rate 67 % use 180-mL saline arthrogram , volume far beyond would tolerate conscious patient . Despite miss half small traumatic arthrotomies last 40 year , outbreak patient return septic arthritis miss arthrotomies . The absence occurrence raise question even necessary formally debride irrigate small traumatic arthrotomies operate room great cost patient . Costs Arthrotomy Despite relative dearth evidence support practice formally irrigate debriding open joint injury , significant healthcare expenditures additional risk general anesthesia undertaken address problem . Although administration general anesthesia become extremely safe , still carry risk serious consequence heart attack , stroke , even death . Patients multiple medical comorbidities even great risk serious perioperative complication . In addition risk undergo anesthesia , significant cost associated operation . A patient diagnose isolated traumatic knee arthrotomy expect leave hospital bill least $ 15,000 base conservative estimate provide Department Research Finance Carolinas Medical Center . In era healthcare cost spiral control , determine intervention efficacious paramount shape healthcare resource utilization maintain long-term sustainability . Specific Aims : 1 . To compare cost medical care patient traumatic arthrotomies treat surgical irrigation debridement versus non-operative treatment local wound care . 2 . To determine incidence develop septic arthritis patient non-operatively treat traumatic arthrotomy . 3 . To determine incidence develop septic arthritis patient operative treatment traumatic arthrotomy . 4 . To determine need additional surgery ( ex : foreign body removal ) patient non-operatively treat traumatic arthrotomy . 5 . To provide description traumatic arthrotomies successfully treat non-operatively . Study Design Prospective Multi-center Observational Cohort</detailed_description>
