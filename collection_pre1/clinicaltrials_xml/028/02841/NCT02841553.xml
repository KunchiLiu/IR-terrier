	<brief_title>Wolfram Syndrome International Registry Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Wolfram syndrome ( OMIM # 222300 ) autosomal recessive disorder characterize insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( DM ) first decade life , follow optic atrophy ( OA ) , blindness , deafness . Death widespread neurodegeneration occur third fourth decade . Postmortem study reveal non-autoimmune loss pancreatic beta-cells responsible diabetes.The investigator discover mutation WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome , rare Mendelian disease strong effect signal pathway may relevance complex type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . Protein synthesis mammalian cell occur primarily endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . There number metabolic condition disrupt process , include increase protein synthesis , synthesis mutate protein , others . When condition occur , trigger adaptive response ER stress sensor serve slow protein synthesis , extreme condition lead apoptosis . The investigator discover beta-cells exhibit high level ER stress animal model Wfs1 deficiency . High level ER stress promote beta-cell death may relate etiology Wolfram syndrome patient , unknown present . Rationale Immunocytochemistry subcellular fractionation study indicate Wolfram protein localize endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane nine transmembrane segment . Fibroblasts patient non-sense mutation gene reveal protein absence cause rapid decay transcript , patient compound missense mutation exhibit markedly reduce protein stability . Thus , patient Wolfram syndrome due certain mutation protein present reduced level , although mechanisms protein participate ER stress reaction still investigation . In contrast , non-inactivating missense mutation describe autosomal dominant low frequency sensorineural hearing loss ( LFSNHI , OMIM # 600965 ) . Virtually nothing known common polymorphic variant appear impact risk type 2 diabetes . Studies animal model demonstrate relationship ER stress Wfs1 ( n.b . nomenclature human gene WFS1 mouse Wfs1 ) . Both Wolfram mRNA protein induce ER stress . Glucose-induced insulin secretion also activate Wfs1 expression reduction Wfs1 mRNA result activation ER stress . ER stress cause diabetes demonstrate mouse knockout eIF2 kinase ( PERK ) , result beta-cell loss diabetes , rare genetic disease characterize mutation gene , result early-onset diabetes epiphyseal dysplasia , Wolcott-Rallison syndrome . These result mouse model suggest lack expression Wfs1 beta-cells appear significant contributor reduction beta-cell survival . While genetic study convincingly demonstrate mutation WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome , alteration expression Wfs1 protein level animal model cell culture result enhance ER stress , relationship WFS1 expression , ER stress , Wolfram syndrome human unclear . The current proposal seek patient Wolfram syndrome enroll Registry . A simple peripheral blood draw obtain patient obtain DNA sequence WFS1 gene . The research problem establish link ER stress diabetes patient monogenic disease strong effect . Analyzing WFS1 gene mutation DNA registry patient Wolfram syndrome allow u test hypothesis . Achieving goal patient may profound effect ultimate treatment common complex disease T2D . When available , parent unaffected sibs patient Registry invite participate study donate blood sample control . As first step , investigator establish registry collect blood sample patient perform genetic test monitor level biomarkers . Study Design In study , investigator hypothesize study monogenic variant strong effect associate severe insulin deficiency Wolfram syndrome provide important insight complex type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . Aim 1 . Establish maintain registry patient Wolfram syndrome . An Internet base registry employ enroll participant clinical diagnosis Wolfram syndrome ( insulin dependent DM bilateral OA ) . Clinical information regard age diagnosis progression disease collate analyzed good define natural history , along potential metabolic phenotype glucose intolerance heterozygous parent unaffected sib . If already complete , blood WFS1 sequence analysis obtain participant ( parent sibs also control purpose ) send CLIA certify lab define mutation . This information benefit patient family refer physician provide genetic diagnosis indicate .
