	<brief_summary>Surgical aortic valve replacement ( SVAR ) currently 'Gold Standard ' therapy patient severe symptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS ) . Approximately 30-50 % patient severe AS deemed inoperable due comorbidities severe respiratory disease , chronic renal disease peripheral vascular disease . Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) emerge novel therapeutic modality inoperable patient effective alternative SAVR select high intermediate-risk patient . Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury ( MRI ) , mediate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , related cardiopulmonary bypass link adverse clinical outcome follow cardiac surgery . In contrast SAVR , transcatheter deployment aortic prosthesis require short time ischemia hypotension may associate less ROS mediate MRI . Inflammatory responses reperfusion injury follow TAVR previously describe compare SAVR . The aim study therefore compare oxidative stress response patient isolate severe symptomatic AS undergoing SAVR TAVR determine whether correlate clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury ( MRI ) relate cardio-pulmonary bypass link adverse clinical outcome follow cardiac surgery . Changes ROS follow SAVR well document literature . Furthermore , pre-operative ROS marker malondialdehyde show predictor adverse outcomes 30-day 1-year follow-up . In contrast SAVR , TAVR associate short duration myocardial ischemia hypotension ad may thus associate low degree MRI . Inflammatory responses reperfusion injury follow TAVR describe compare SAVR . Cellular respiration lead generation partially reduce oxygen derivative call ROS . Under normal physiological condition , ROS serve integral component cellular signal pathway . A balanced redox state establish major ROS produce system ( NADPH oxidase , xanthine oxidase , nitric oxide synthase , myeloperoxidase lipoxygenases ) major antioxidant system ( catalase , Î±-tocopherol , ascorbic acid , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase glutathione S transferases conjugate reduce GSH hydrophobic organic compound glutathione ) . Excess production reduce degradation ROS antioxidant defense system impose oxidative burden upon cellular environment lead modification numerous biomolecules functional defect . In MRI enzyme xanthine oxidase catalyze formation uric acid coproduction superoxide . Superoxide release result recruitment activation neutrophil adherence endothelial cell , stimulate formation xanthine oxidase endothelium , superoxide production . Oxidation DNA proteins may follow lead membrane damage lipid peroxidation lead alteration membrane permeability , modification protein structure functional change . Oxidative damage mitochondrial membrane also occur result membrane depolarization uncouple oxidative phosphorylation alter cellular respiration . This ultimately lead mitochondrial damage , release cytochrome c , activation caspase apoptosis . Although TAVR may expose myocardium level MRI SAVR , patient undergo TAVR great number co-morbidities may thus great baseline ROS burden patient undergo SAVR . As generation ROS patient undergo TAVR whether difference ROS level patient correlate clinical outcome describe . The prospective study attempt address question .</detailed_description>
