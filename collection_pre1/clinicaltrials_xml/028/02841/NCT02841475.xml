	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common condition whose prevalence increase advance age . One main complication arrhythmia occurrence systemic thromboembolism , first occurrence cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) . The advanced age independent risk factor occurrence stroke context AF , evidence score award age 75 year risk estimate thromboembolism score CHA2DS2-Vasc . Making elderly priority target prevention thromboembolism , increase thromboembolic risk prevalence AF population . For many year , vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) proven effectiveness context . But effectiveness safety thromboembolism prevention anti-vitamin K treatment involve maintain INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) therapeutic range . Indeed occur thromboembolic haemorrhagic adverse event directly correlate INR outside therapeutic range maintain INR therapeutic range subject many variation inter- intra-individual . They include , genetic factor , food , drug interaction , well disease process . Or one elderly characteristic coexistence multiple pathological process comorbidities . The supposed interaction comorbidities variability INR little study : Only study examine factor associate stability INR unstable . The identification patient risk instability INR yet allow clinician great vigilance good identification patient initiation treatment vitamin K appear best therapeutic strategy . Our study seek determine whether comorbidity , assess Charlson comorbidity index , associate instability INR , among 80 year patient treat AVK atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
