	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm head neck cancer ( Squamous cell histology well HPV+ and/or EBV+ head neck tumor ) , Stages IVA , IVB , select case Stage III ( see additional criterion ) . 2 . Completed curative intent therapy , without additional standard care curative intent therapy feasible ( see additional detail ) . 3 . After prior curative intent treatment HNC estimate risk recurrence ≥4050 % fall one category ( A , OR B , OR C , OR D , OR E ) . While exact estimation risk recurrence difficult follow category include reflect patient substantial risk tumor recurrence already early evidence recurrence : A Any HNC patient eligible adjuvant treatment protocol AFTER completion curative intent therapy : HPV ( ) HNC : N2C , N3 , bulky N2B disease ( ≥5cm LN/tumor conglomerate ) . HPV ( + ) HNC : N2C , N3 , AND ≥10 pack year tobacco use HPV ( + ) HNC multilevel nodal involvement , AND bulky N2B disease ( ≥5cm LN/tumor conglomerate ) , AND ≥ 10 pack year tobacco use EBV ( + ) NPC may eligible criterion A , alternative criterion B , C , D , E meet . HNC supraclavicular mediastinal nodal involvement ( either HPV+ HPV EBV+ ) time curative intent treatment Residual mass area prior tumor biopsy show residual tumor , remain concern require close followup AND resected/resectable . Nonresponders induction chemotherapy ( PD induction , lack tumor shrinkage ( &lt; 15 % per RECIST ) Interrupted treatment course lower intend radiation dose i.e . interruption radiation ≥3 week ( cumulative ) , delivery ≤50 Gy part radiation base treatment ( NOT deescalation approach ) . Persistence EBV+ HPV+ DNA blood post treatment meet criteria C OR E B Patient treat salvage treatment ( i.e . salvage surgery reirradiation ) residual recurrent tumor prior radiation base therapy ( either HPV+ HPV EBV+ ) AND candidate additional curative intent therapy ( various reason include poor performance status , comorbidities , refusal patient , prior radiation reirradiation , etc ) . Positive margin residual tumor may still acceptable ( see D ) ) C Mx ( ≤2cm long diameter ) indeterminate distant lesion present curative intent therapy either shrunk therapy remain visible/stable post therapy ( may include SBRT treatment lesion ) . D Oligometastatic disease treat SBRT curativeintent therapy ( e.g . surgery RFA , etc ) oligometastatic disease . E Microscopic low volume residual tumor surgery radiation base treatment ( include salvage treatment oligomet/SBRT ) , AND candidate additional curative intent therapy ( various reason include feasibility , poor performance status , comorbidities , refusal patient , prior radiation reirradiation , etc ) . Low volume disease define 5 lesion , ≤2 cm long diameter , OR difficult assess tumor measurement roughly equivalent volume tumor ≤2cm diameter ( 5 lesion ) . Please note measurable disease NOT require , general guidance patient measurable disease may better serve dedicated treatment trial . There may additional scenario patient consider high risk disease recurrence patient consider enrollment discussion approval PI and/or coPI . 4 . Availability tumor tissue ( ≥10 slide ) PDL1 , gene expression profile ( GEP ) , additional testing . 5 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . 6 . Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . 7 . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . An ECOG performance status 2 acceptable patient ECOG 0/1 prior curative intent therapy midst recovery curative intent therapy 8 . Demonstrate reasonable organ function , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . 9 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 11 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 2 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Has hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 5 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 6 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy typical side effect radiotherapy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer tumor likely influence live expectancy subsequent 3 year without active treatment ( e.g . low grade prostate cancer absence therapy ) . 8 . Has know active ( =growing ) central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Radiation resect brain metastasis acceptable clinically stable . 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 10 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 11 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 12 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 13 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 14 . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . 15 . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . 16 . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . 17 . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow within 30 day prior initiation treatment</criteria>
