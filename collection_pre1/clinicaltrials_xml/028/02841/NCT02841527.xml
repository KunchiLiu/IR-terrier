	<detailed_description>Obesity increase health problem UK one predict worsen . It associate many health problem shorten person 's life span impair quality life . Current national guideline recommend surgery consider overweight ( morbidly obese ) remain obese try option . In UK worldwide three commonly perform operation laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( 'BAND surgery ' ) , laparoscopic gastric bypass ( 'BYPASS ' ) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( 'SLEEVE ' ) . All lead weight loss , associate different problem . In short term vary complication inconvenience relate operation . In long term different outcome relate weight regain , symptoms side effect surgery . This study ( BYBANDSLEEVE ) randomise trial recruitment target 1341 patient eleven hospital aim compare effectiveness , cost effectiveness acceptability BAND , BYPASS SLEEVE surgery . The process randomisation mean participant chance receive one three procedure , fair comparison make . The first phase ( two hospital ) test feasibility recruitment optimise information patient maximise trial recruitment . It establish core set clinical outcome use evaluate surgery morbid obesity . The second stage ( 11 hospital ) recruit full sample follow participant least three year . The investigator compare effect BAND , BYPASS AND SLEEVE surgery three year randomisation weight loss , wide range symptom aspects quality life . The investigator also examine patient ' detailed experience follow , nutritional outcome , short long term surgical complication National Health Service ( NHS ) value money .</detailed_description>
