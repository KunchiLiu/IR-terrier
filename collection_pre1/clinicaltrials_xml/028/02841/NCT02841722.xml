	<brief_summary>The anti-cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy often cause neutropenia grade IV febrile neutropenia . Those neutropenia , addition comorbidity factor , result dose reduction and/or temporary permanent stop chemotherapy , thus impact clinical response . To avoid episode , shorten duration reduce associate risk , administration Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) recommend . Recombinant G-CSF reproduces physiological effect endogenous G-CSF increase proliferation granulocyte progenitor . Different form G-CSF available : daily administration ( filgrastim , lenograstim ) single administration ( pegfilgrastim ) . Various international learn society offer recommendation primary care , secondary curative neutropenia induce chemotherapy base G-CSF . However , guidance ideal time administration growth factor duration administration clear . If seem clear treatment initiate within first 24 hour follow administration chemotherapy , summary characteristics different product provide evidence optimize administration day depend kinetics evolution neutrophil . In addition , information give choice formulation respect . The pilot study investigator propose aim model effect exogenous G-CSF evolution neutrophil function time explain pharmacodynamic variability administration chemotherapy base eribulin . The description evolution neutrophils growth factor administer give opportunity streamline administration regimens factor provide guidance circumstance give weekly chemotherapy . Expected benefit foreseeable risk With exception surplus withdrawal first 2 cycle treatment , study impact care patient .</brief_summary>
