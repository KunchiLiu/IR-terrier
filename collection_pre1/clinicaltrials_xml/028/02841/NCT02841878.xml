	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) profoundly affect quality life . Mucosal micro-inflammation , epithelial permeability disorder proteases activity increase demonstrate patient ' gastrointestinal tract . Protease activity increase could subject genetic determinism ( decrease proteases inhibitor gene expression ) . Objectives : 1/ To study relation proteases activity ( stool colonic biopsy supernatant ) , proteases inhibitor gene expression mucosal cellular infiltrate ( IBS patient healthy subject ) . 2/ Establishing correlation protease activity , mucosal micro-inflammation symptom . 3/ To evaluate protease inhibitor therapeutic potential . Expected result : 1/ Decreased expression proteases inhibitor gene subject IBS . 2/ Correlation symptom proteases activity intensity . 3/ Demonstration restorative potential protease inhibitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) first reason consultation gastroenterology prevalence reach 5 % general population . IBS characterize abdominal discomfort , diarrhea constipation decrease quality life . Recent fact IBS pathophysiology show association mucosal immunity activation ( mast cell protease ) epithelial permeability disorder . Permeability disorder reproduce application colonic biopsy culture supernatant in-vitro cell culture . In parallel , tight junction protein mRNA ( ZO-1 , Occludin ) decrease observe ex-vivo biopsy in-vitro . Gut bacterial protease ( cystein serin protease ) may also play role . In human , proteases activity correlate IBS symptom severity . Proteases activity increase ( cystein serin protease ) poorly understood , increase could subject genetic determinism ( decrease proteases inhibitor gene expression - Serpin A1/E1 ) . Objectives : 1/ To study relation proteases activity ( stool colonic biopsy supernatant ) , proteases inhibitor gene expression mucosal cellular infiltrate ( IBS patient healthy subject ) . 2/ Establishing correlation protease activity , mucosal micro-inflammation symptom . 3/ To evaluate protease inhibitor therapeutic potential . Method : Subjects recruit gastroenterology consultation . IBS patient answer Rome III criterion . Patients come screen colonoscopy define healthy subject . Colonic biopsy send real time research laboratory ( EA 6302 ) supernatant collect , mRNA expression study ( Serpins , ZO-1 , occludin , cytokine ) , proteases activity / permeability measurement proteases inhibitor reversibility test . Histologic study also perform . Expected result : 1/ Decreased expression proteases inhibitor gene subject IBS . 2/ Correlation symptom proteases activity intensity . 3/ Demonstration restorative potential protease inhibitor .</detailed_description>
