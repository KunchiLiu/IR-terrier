	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether hydration status affect blood sugar control appetite regulation . In order , participant undergo monitor phase whereby weight , diet physical activity monitor , follow dehydration protocol involve fluid restriction sit heat tent . In one arm trial , participant remain dehydrated remainder day ( i.e . heat tent ) fluid intake restrict , arm trial , participant rehydrated consume necessary amount plain water . All participant undergo arm trial , order choose randomly . Several measure take throughout trial . Before participant go heat tent , provide urine sample ( baseline hydration status indicate urine osmolality ) , blood sample ( glucose , insulin , arginine vasopressin , /copeptin , ghrelin serum osmolality plasma volume ) , peripheral quantitative computer tomography scan thigh indicate muscle size . On day proceed heat tent , participant measure repeat , along metabolic rate consume 75 g glucose drink , follow 15 minutely blood sample hourly metabolic rate measure 120 minute ( i.e . oral glucose tolerance test ; OGTT ) . Following , participant present large bowl pasta sauce instruct eat satisfied ( maximum 30 min ) . Blood sample take every 10 minute 60 minute follow meal . Participants also option opt-in muscle biopsy take . This take ~120 minute glucose drink .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate whether hydration status affect blood sugar control appetite regulation . This randomise crossover trial two trial arm separate 5-35 day . Each trial arm consist five day total , difference trial arm amount fluid consume heat tent day 4 ( describe ) . Days 1-3 trial arm monitoring phase . Participants give chest mount activity monitor ( ActiHeart TM ) , body mass scale , food diary food weigh scale three urine sample pot . Participants require provide urine sample upon wake , note weight eat . The activity monitor need worn midnight day 1 order gauge three full 24-h period activity . The food diary also start point ; participant require weigh record food beverage ( include record leftover ) . On day 3 monitoring phase , participant require continue normal daily routine , however provide set amount water consume ( 40 mL/kg lean body mass ) order standardize baseline hydration status . No food fluid allow consumed 2200 h day 3 . On day 4 , participant take measure ( weight urine sample ) arrive university fast state ( i.e . food fluid ) . A blood sample drawn antecubital vein follow peripheral quantitative computer tomography ( pQCT ) scan thigh . After blood sample scan , participant may eat food list low water-content food rest day . At approximately midday ( flexible depend participant ' availability , match trial arm ) , participant weigh , place heat tent ( 40-50 degree Celsius ) lose 1 % pre-heat tent weight maximum one hour ( whichever come first ) . On second trial arm , participant match percentage body mass loss , even require spend less time heat tent , still one hour . After heat tent , participant receive salty meal order facilitate fluid absorption/retention . This matched trial arm order reduce confound . In dehydration trial arm , participant provide 3 mL/kg lean body mass plain water consume rest day . In rehydration trial arm , participant give 40 mL/kg lean body mass plus 150 % body mass loss heat tent . This meter throughout day maximise rehydration . Thus amount water consume day 4 heat tent discernible difference trial arm , everything else match . In trial arm plain water ( i.e . caffeine alcohol ) allow consume , food dry food list eaten . This match subsequent trial arm . No food fluid 2200 h day 4 . On fifth day trial arm , participant require attend laboratory approximately 0730 h ( ± 1 h ) . A urine sample collect , along body mass . Another pQCT scan thigh take participant ' metabolic rate measure use Douglas bag method . As part trial , participant able opt-in muscle biopsy . If opted-in , muscle biopsy take pQCT scan . This involve local anesthetic ( Lidocaine ) , make small incision use scalpel , obtain muscle sample use Bergstrom technique . Participants fit cannula , hand place 60 degree Celsius hotbox five minute , baseline blood sample drawn . Participants give 75 g glucose drink consume within five minute . Whilst remain rest , researcher draw 10 mL blood sample every 15 minute 120 minute , approximately 10 mL saline infuse blood sample drawn . Metabolic rate measure 0 ( pre-OGTT ) , 60 120 minute . For participant opted-in muscle biopsy , another one take 120 minute . Participants present computer base appetite assess psychological inventory assess subconscious food preference . These test pilot data future research . Following , participant present pasta meal , instruction eat satisfy maximum 30 minute . After 30 minute , blood sample drawn , follow 10 minutely sample 60 minute . Visual analogue scale subjective appetite rating take pre-meal , immediately , post-meal , 30 60 minute post-meal . The cannula remove . The sample size require trial 16 participant , calculate use pilot data assess blood glucose control dehydrate rehydrated . Based pilot study , hydration status result marked difference rate return fast glycaemia . This primary conclusion support magnitude effect 45 minute post-oral glucose tolerance test ( D = 1.1 mmol/l ) . The standard deviation time point control ( normal hydration ) group also 1.1 mmol/l , result effect size ( ) ≈1 . To provide 95 % power ( beta level ) detect effect alpha level ( p ) less equal 0.05 use 2 -- tail paired -- test require ~16 participant . If participant complete study ( i.e . miss data ) , data include analysis . In word , analysis plan per protocol ( completers ) . The statistical technique use linear model post-hoc t-tests correct multiple comparison relevant . However , final dataset obtain , statistical test may subject change ( e.g . data non-parametric ) .</detailed_description>
