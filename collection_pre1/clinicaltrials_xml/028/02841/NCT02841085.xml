	<brief_title>New Genetic Mutations Thromboembolic Venous Disease Idiopathic . Study `` FIT GENETIQUE '' .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism desease public health problem justify major primary secondary prevention policy . When VTE occur absence risk factor clinically identifiable ( `` idiopathic '' ) , inherited biological risk factor ( `` inherit thrombophilia '' ) find 30 % case . However , patient idiopathic VTE , risk recurrent venous thromboembolism high , whether detectable inherited thrombophilia find . This first observation suggest patient idiopathic VTE detectable thrombophilia likely underlie unknown thrombophilia yet discover . This hypothesis support result study `` FIT '' ( Regional PHRC 2001 , promoter CHU Brest , Investigator Main : Francis Couturaud , EA3878 Brest , France , investigator Associate : Clive Kearon , McMaster University , Hamilton , Ontario , Canada ) , cross international study evaluate risk VTE among family member first degree patient first idiopathic VTE episode . In large study cross-1950 family member first degree ( topic study ) 372 patient first episode VTE Idiopathic ( propositus ) include ( 50 % include Brest 50 % inclusive Canada ) . The main result risk VTE among family member first degree high similar , proband either bearer without detectable hereditary thrombophilia . In word , even absence detectable hereditary thrombophilia , risk VTE among family member first degree high . This study identify subject likely inherit thrombophilia yet discover .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Family member 1st , 2nd , 3rd 4th degree ( spouse descent ) patient ( propositus ) : 1 . / single episode unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease without detectable inherit acquire thrombophilia ; 2 . / include `` FIT '' study ; 3 . / consent family member 2nd , 3rd 4th degree approach participate study .
