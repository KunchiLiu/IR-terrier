	<brief_title>A Trial PF-06252616 Ambulatory Participants With LGMD2I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 1b/2 , open-label multiple ascend dose escalation study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy , PK PD PF 06252616 ambulatory adult LGMD2I . The study design intend determine optimal safe pharmacologically active dose PF 06252616 LGMD2I provide opportunity subject receive active drug rare disable disorder . The study conduct three period : Lead-In , Treatment Follow-up period . The Lead-In Follow-up period 16 week allow assessment change various outcome measure period time comparison change function , treatment . The Treatment period 32 week . Three cohort participant enrol receive escalating dos PF 06252616 . The first cohort option crossover high dose .</detailed_description>
