	<brief_summary>In case psychotic disorder bipolar disorder schizophrenia , attention dysfunction contribute , accord theory neuroscience , development mood disorder follow disturbance interaction-care emotion . In context , general objective research project refine understanding similarity distinction bipolar schizophrenic patient basic emotional information processing . Specifically , : 1 ) good understand level basic emotional information processing condition differ comparable sense 2 ) estimate , pathology , specific influence nature task process emotional information . To answer question , investigator develop protocol specifically target different information processing channel play nature spatial frequency content emotional natural scene . To estimate pathology , specific influence nature task emotional processing , 3 type task propose : 1 ) simple task perception 2 ) -3 ) two task whose categorization one focus emotional feeling individual tendency action . Both tasks categorization involve specifically ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( CPFVM ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) respectively . All patient data compare data healthy control participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main goal This research project generally aim refine understand similarity distinction bipolar schizophrenic patient emotional information processing . Specifically , : 1. good understand level emotional information processing condition differ comparable direction 2. ass specifically pathology , emotional regulation deficit realization different cognitive task process emotional information . To answer question , investigator develop original protocol image functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) specifically target different information processing channel play nature spatial frequency content emotional natural scene ( see Methods ) . emotional regulation deficit disorder address part 3 type task : 1 ) simple task perception 2 ) -3 ) two task categorization center emotional feeling individual ( task affective ) tendency action ( motivational task ) . Both tasks categorization involve specifically Prefrontal Cortex-Ventro Median ( CPFVM ) Lateral Prefrontal Cortex-Dorso ( DLPFC ) , respectively , distinguish two category patient . All patient data compare healthy control participant . This project also allow u improve knowledge bipolar schizophrenic patient compare control subject , ) brain structure network involve emotional information process emotional regulation , ii ) functional relationship still unclear neural structure involve process iii ) nature information pass network .</detailed_description>
