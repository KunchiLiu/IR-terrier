	<brief_title>Multimodal Imaging Analysis During Treatment With Bevacizumab Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastomas tumor poor prognosis . The treatment recurrent glioblastoma standard first-line treatment clearly codify , however , many result literature show benefit bevacizumab ( anti- angiogenic therapy ) often propose indication . Tissue action , response mechanism therapeutic escape remain poorly understood . The investigator hypothesize response mechanism control change parameter tumor tissue , hypoxia , neoangiogenesis , cell density multimodal image help u good understand mechanism . To identify parameter image would best measure response mechanism , investigator want evaluate first study particular indication , property measure call Anglo -Saxon ' sensitivity change `` say , sensitivity ability measure change . This additional property reproducibility measurement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>World Health Organization performance index lower equal 3 Estimated life expectancy great 3 month patient diagnosis glioblastoma histologically proven Patient tumor progression morphological magnetic resonance imagery evidence Pluri Disciplinary Meeting . This increase must meet detailed criterion Response Assessment Neuro Oncology Working group : except case new lesion appear outside field radiotherapy , tumor progression therefore define magnetic resonance imagery perform period shorter 12 week last day radiotherapy ( see criterion Response Assessment Neuro Oncology Working Group detail chapter 21 B ) Patient unilateral tensor injury baseline ( order case tumor region interest area area equivalent region interest contralateral healthy tissue ) . Patient measurable lesion baseline , accord criterion define work group Respons Assessment Neuro Oncology . The lesion contrast measure twodimensionally T1 gadolinium axial section . The two perpendicular diameter red lead 10 mm least two axial section . Patient progression radiotherapy receive least one chemotherapy regimen ( temodal ) A patient treatment bevacizumab monotherapy Pregnancy Exclusion criterion related con realization positron emission tomography magnetic resonance imagery : Weight great 120 kg , Foreign body incompatible magnetic resonance imagery ( eg metallic intraocular foreign body ) , Medical equipment instal incompatible magnetic resonance imagery ( eg pacemaker ) Pregnant lactate woman</criteria>
