	<brief_summary>This study open label pilot study explore utility thermography assess response Golimumab treatment Psoriatic Arthritis ( PsA ) . Ten patient fulfil Classification criterion Psoriatic Arthritis ( CASPAR ) Psoriatic Arthritis active disease eligible anti-TNF therapy invite participate study . They assess 4 time point study : prior first anti-TNF medication ( screen basal visit ) , subsequently within 5 day 2nd 4th dos monthly Golimumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermography Assessing Treatment Response Golimumab Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriatic Arthritis joint problem ( arthritis ) often occur skin condition call psoriasis . Psoriasis common skin problem cause red patch body , on-going ( chronic ) inflammatory condition . About 1 20 people psoriasis develop arthritis skin condition . In case , psoriasis come arthritis . The cause Psoriatic Arthritis know . Psoriatic Arthritis treat use different type drug reduce pain swell joint . New medicine block inflammatory protein call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) widely use progressive Psoriatic Arthritis , case drug Golimumab . Thermography use image study heat distribution different part body , allow one see variation temperature , example detect joint inflammation . This pilot study evaluate whether thermography able reliably detect joint inflammation Psoriatic Arthritis , whether able detect improvement worsen inflammation medical treatment Golimumab . This involve assess disease activity use questionnaire , examine patient joint , perform blood test , ultrasound thermography .</detailed_description>
