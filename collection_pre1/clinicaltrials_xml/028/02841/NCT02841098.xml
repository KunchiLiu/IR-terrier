	<brief_title>`` Endarterectomy Combined With Optimal Medical Therapy ( OMT ) v OMT Alone Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Atherosclerotic Carotid Artery Stenosis Higher-than-average Risk Ipsilateral Stroke ``</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid artery stenosis &gt; = 50 % affect 3 % subject &gt; = 60 year accounts 15 % ischemic stroke . Overall , patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis low risk ipsilateral stroke modern medical therapy . It therefore uncertain whether benefit carotid surgery still justify perioperative risk stroke death , whether revascularisation good value money consider compete demand health service . Several image technique develop identify patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis higher-than-average risk ipsilateral stroke . Specifically , presence transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) -detected embolic signal , intraplaque haemorrhage magnetic resonance imaging , TCD-measured impair cerebral vasomotor reserve rapid stenosis progression show involve least 3-fold high risk ipsilateral stroke . However , recommendation clinical practice make regard use tool , utility must demonstrate formal randomised clinical trial . Our hypothesis use predictor identify subset patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis could benefit prophylactic endarterectomy . Carotid endarterectomy The procedure carry technique routinely use surgeon . Operative report perioperative complication collect . CEA perform soon possible , within 60 day randomization . Optimal medical therapy OMT apply patient start immediately randomisation . OMT define adhoc committee follow relevant guideline . It include : - Antiplatelet therapy . If patient require anticoagulation reason ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , patient treat appropriate anticoagulant accord practice centre alternative antiplatelet therapy . - Antihypertensive treatment , require , achieve target blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg ( high target may define OMT committee select condition , e.g . contralateral carotid occlusion ) Application structure program , stepped-care approach use rank antihypertensive drug use . - High-dose statin treatment ( target LDL &lt; 0.7 g/l ) . A stepped-care approach rake lipid-lowering drug also use . - Patients smoking time randomisation encourage stop join smoke cessation support program . - Other lifestyle modification : reduction alcohol consumption , choose healthy food , increase regular physical activity , reduction body weight relevant . OMT may modify course trial take account revise guideline new evidence .</detailed_description>
