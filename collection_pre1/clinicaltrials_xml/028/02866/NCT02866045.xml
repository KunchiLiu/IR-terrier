	<detailed_description>Subepithelial lesion gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract commonly identify routine endoscopy . Most lesion benign . However potential malignant transformation important correctly identify lesion order determine therapy and/or surveillance necessary patient . Leiomyoma , neural origin tumor , lipoma , duplication cyst , pancreatic rest , inflammatory fibroid polyp , granular cell tumor consider benign SELs . Gastrointestinal stromal tumor , lymphoma , carcinoid , metastatic carcinoma , glomus tumor malignant potentially malignant lesion . Obtaining diagnosis SELs often difficult since biopsy normal overlie surface mucosal layer typically normal . Jumbo forceps biopsy , bite-on-bite technique conventional biopsy forceps , endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) guide fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) , fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) , single incision needle-knife biopsy ( SINK ) , endoscopic resection allow sample deep tissue layer may provide histologic diagnosis . However standard biopsy method diagnose SELs . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) helpful image diagnostic tool evaluation SELs capable assess size , layer origin , echo pattern . However , reliable enough differentiate benign malignant SELs . The combination EUS fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) allow cytologic diagnostic accuracy 80 % . If malignant tumor suspect , tissue acquisition important management may vary base type SEL . EUS-FNA enables small needle pass lesion interest ultrasound guidance , obtain cellular material cytology analysis . Although previous report show accuracy rate EUS-FNA SEL range 72 % 90 % often problem inadequate cellular aspirate additional immunocytochemical examination . This problem cause miss rate approximately 40 % additional immunocytochemical analysis may need reach definitive diagnosis GISTs , although macroscopic appearance alone often sufficient . Using large FNA needle perform biopsy seem logical solution limitation . However , thus far show improve adequacy biopsy aspirate . For reason , core biopsy needle ( EUS-FNB ) develop hope obtain core tissue histology . The advantage biopsy core specimen well know evaluation tissue architecture increase diagnostic yield compare cytology obtain FNA . In addition , tissue core biopsy critical diagnose characterize SELs provide high rate immunohistological evaluation . Recently , novel design core biopsy needle ( Sharkcore , Medtronic ) introduce preliminary data suggest superior diagnostic performance compare previous version core biopsy needle . How new needle performs diagnostic evaluation SELs remain unclear . Single-incision needle-knife ( SINK ) biopsy alternative diagnostic method acquire tissue sample . By use conventional needle knife sphincterotome , overlie mucosa SELs open single linear incision 10 mm tissue sample obtain pass conventional biopsy forceps open deep tumor . According preliminary study de la Serna Higuera et al , technique provide sufficient tissue sample high diagnostic yield 92.8 % . However , biopsy method possible visible bulge SEL apparent within lumen gastrointestinal tract . The investigator believe technique offer potential obtain substantial tissue sample much likely provide definitive diagnosis subepithelial tumor . In addition , hop biopsy sample obtain via SINK well able provide adequate tissue determination mitotic rate GIST tumor , major predictor malignant risk lesion . However , SINK method compare late EUS-FNB core needle unclear , term diagnostic efficacy obtain diagnosis term safety profile . The purpose study prospectively compare efficacy safety EUS-FNB use new SharkCore needle SINK biopsy patient upper GI SELs . The result study determine method perform confirm diagnosis SELs .</detailed_description>
