	<brief_summary>As patent brand-name immunosuppressive medication expire , increase interest use generic immunosuppressive drug . However , despite pharmacokinetic study show bioequivalence , question remain regard clinical impact use generic immunosuppression . The important immunosuppressive agent modern transplant era arguably tacrolimus , calcineurin-inhibitor narrow therapeutic index . This study seek answer question regard clinical impact generic tacrolimus use measure primarily acute rejection , loss graft function , patient death randomize trial 4 parallel group : Brand tacrolimus , brand tacrolimus 6 month switch Generic A , Generic A , Generic A 6 month switch generic tacrolimus . Given kidney , liver , heart transplantation commonly perform transplant well-defined measure rejection graft failure , organ study two-center study design accrue target number transplant recipient within three-year study period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomize , open-label , multicenter , parallel , observational study ass safety efficacy 300 kidney , heart liver transplant recipient compare brand tacrolimus generic combination generic brand tacrolimus three year follow period . All subject receive immunosuppressive medication include induction therapy ( thymoglobulin , basiliximab , induction ) maintenance include mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroid therapy direct standard-of-care center . Their medication information record study file . The study population include recipient kidney , liver , heart allograft first 14 day transplantation . The total 15 visit 36 month period plan follow . The blood sample specify translational research study lab . Subjects continue receive routine lab part standard care treat physician . For detailed information study lab schedule see Table 5 Study Schedule , study safety lab organ see Appendix 4 . These safety lab do part stand care treat physician . If subject need study drug medication next study visit subject come clinic get new supply . First ( Baseline ) Visit ( 14 day transplant study subject discharge hospital ) : - Subject review sign consent form - Review subject 's medical history - Review subject 's current medication - Review subject 's physical exam include vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , pulse respiration rate ) , height weight - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - About 16 cc blood sample ( 3.2 teaspoon blood ) collect subject translational research study laboratory test - Randomization subject - Subject receive study drug . Month 1 Visit : - Review subject 's current medication - Review subject 's physical exam include vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , pulse respiration rate ) , height weight - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - Subject return complete dose diary receives new dose diary - Subject receive study drug . Month 2/3 Visit : - Review subject 's current medication - Review subject 's physical exam include vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , pulse respiration rate ) , height weight - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - About 16 cc blood sample ( 3.2 teaspoon blood ) collect subject translational research study laboratory test ( Month 3 Visit ) - Subject return complete dose diary receives unfilled dose diary - Subject receive study drug . Month 6/9/12/24 Visit : - Review subject 's current medication - Review subject 's physical exam include vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , pulse respiration rate ) , height weight - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - About 32 cc blood sample ( 6.5 teaspoon blood ) ( Month 6 Visit ) 16 cc ( 3.2 teaspoon ) Month 9 , 12 24 collect subject translational research study laboratory test - Subject return complete dose diary receives unfilled dose diary - Subject receive study drug applicable . - If Group 4 subject receive immunosuppressant drug local pharmacy Month 15/21/27/33 Visit : - Subject receive study drug applicable - If Group 4 subject receive immunosuppressant drug local pharmacy - If Group 4 subject come clinic study visit subject receive CleverCap dose diary mail . The subject also receive instruction mail back old CleverCap dosing diary . Month 18/30 Visit : - Review subject 's current medication - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - Subject return complete dose diary receives unfilled dose diary - Subject receive study drug applicable . - If Group 4 subject receive immunosuppressant drug local pharmacy Month 36 Visit ( End Study Visit ) : - Review subject 's current medication - Review change subject 's health reaction study medication record - About 16 cc blood sample ( 3.2 teaspoon blood ) collect subject translational research study laboratory test - Subject return final complete dose diary - Subject return study drug remain possession study team A safety follow-up phone call make month 37 ( +/- I week ) record patient 's wellbeing graft survival . This call serve last AE follow-up report month 36 . Total blood 32 cc blood ( approximately 6.5 teaspoon ) drawn subject Month 6 study visit . At Baseline , Month 3 , Month 9 , Month 12 , Month 24 Month 36 study visit subject draw 16 cc ( approximately 3.2 teaspoon ) blood . During course study ( approximately 3 year participation study ) , total amount blood drawn approximately 128 cc ( approximately 8.7 tablespoon 1/2 cup ) . This third amount usually draw someone donate pint blood . Also , subject continue routine blood urine collection monitor heart , liver kidney function part standard care treatment UCLA UCSD UCI . These routine blood collection include total blood study discuss . The schedule routine blood urine collection depend subject 's condition treat physician 's discretion . Adherence measure daily medication diary , CleverCaps electronic pill bottle cap , coefficient variation tacrolimus subject ' blood .</detailed_description>
