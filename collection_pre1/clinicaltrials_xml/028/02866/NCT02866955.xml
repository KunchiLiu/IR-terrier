	<brief_summary>Despite advance early detection treatment strategy , 25 40 % patient treat breast cancer develop metastasis . Some patient therapeutic impasse situation . It therefore necessary consider possible option . The Estramustine show encouraging result treatment metastatic breast cancer . Given clinical data , answer rate Estramustine impact progression free survival deserve study earlier clinical situation . This Phase II study evaluate efficacy Estramustine woman breast cancer metastates , already treat aromatase inhibitor treatment fail .</brief_summary>
