	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Ingenol Mebutate Gel 0.015 % Treatment AK Face Solid Organ Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses ( AK ) patch dysplastic keratinocytes arise sun-damaged skin . These lesion precursor cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , treat prevent progression SCC . First-line therapy AK include cryotherapy curettage , target clinically visible lesion address subclinical lesion field ultraviolet radiation damage . Field therapy include topical chemotherapy , immunotherapy , photodynamic therapy . Ingenol mebutate active compound find Euphorbia peplus sap , approve treatment AK immunocompetent patient . Ingenol mebutate 0.015 % favored topical treatment treatment AK face due brief treatment course , high clearance rate , resolution without sequela . Solid organ transplant recipient ( OTR ) high incidence AK high risk develop SCC , require frequent field therapy . In addition , OTR generally high burden AK require treatment large surface area 25 cm2 area label ingenol mebutate 0.015 % . The investigator plan investigate safety efficacy ingenol mebutate 0.015 % OTR , treatment area 100cm2 . This single arm , open-label interventional study ingenol mebutate 0.015 % solid organ transplant recipient . The investigator plan treat 20 subject , 10 kidney transplant recipients 10 lung transplant recipient . The investigator select two population represent spectrum solid organ transplantation : kidney transplant recipient large transplant population , low level immunosuppression skin cancer risk . Lung transplant recipient high burden skin cancer actinic keratoses .</detailed_description>
