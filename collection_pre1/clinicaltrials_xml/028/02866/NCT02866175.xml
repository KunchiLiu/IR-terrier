	<brief_summary>There insufficient data safety efficacy edoxaban plus antiplatelet therapy subject atrial fibrillation AF follow percutaneous intervention PCI stenting . This study design evaluate safety explore efficacy edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen versus vitamin K antagonist VKA-based antithrombotic regimen subject AF follow PCI stent placement . Bleeding central safety outcome cardiovascular clinical trial , especially antithrombotic strategy invasive procedure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>OAC indication atrial fibrillation period least 12 month follow successful PCI stenting . Eligibility assess 4 hour sheath removal within 5 day successful PCI stent placement . If stag PCI plan , eligibility assess completion last stage . Successful PCI definition : The success PCI procedure define 2 interrelated component : angiographic finding , procedural / clinical outcome detail : Angiographic Success A minimum stenosis diameter &lt; 20 % ( visually assess angiography residual blockage stenosis reduce less 20 % artery 's diameter ) . Sufficient enlargement lumen target site improve coronary artery blood flow final TIMI flow grade 3 ( visually assess angiography ) , without occlusion significant side branch , flowlimiting dissection , distal embolization , angiographic thrombus . Procedural Success No major inhospital clinical complication ( e.g . ongoing ISTH major clinical relevant nonmajor procedural bleeding time randomization , stroke , emergency CABG ) . In summary , clinically successful PCI require anatomic procedural success along relief sign and/or symptoms myocardial ischemia time randomization . Bleeding risk systemic condition Known bleed diathesis , include limited , 1 . Uncontrolled active bleeding , encompass ISTH major clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding , precede randomization . Lesion condition , consider significant risk major bleeding . This may include limited : unresolved gastrointestinal ulceration , presence malignant neoplasms high risk bleeding ( e.g . malignancy metastasis ) , recent unresolved brain spinal injury , recent brain , spinal ophthalmic surgery , intracranial hemorrhage , know suspected esophageal varix , arteriovenous malformation , vascular aneurysm ( 3.5 cm ) major intraspinal intracerebral vascular abnormality . 2 . Medicationrelated INR &gt; 2.5 ( subject reconsider late time , within 5 day sheath removal ) . Contraindication edoxaban , VKA , ASA and/or P2Y12 antagonist ; Concomitant treatment antithrombotic agent , fibrinolytic therapy chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Concomitant condition therapy Critically ill hemodynamically unstable subject ( time randomization ) include : 1. cardiogenic shock acute decompensated heart failure , requirement vasopressor agent inotropic support mechanical support support circulation 2. respiratory failure require endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation . Any prior mechanical valvular prosthesis ; Planned coronary vascular intervention major surgery within 12 month ; Randomization must defer last stage multistep , multivessel PCI procedure ; Moderate severe mitral stenosis ; Ischemic stroke within 2 week prior randomization ; Uncontrolled severe hypertension systolic blood pressure ( BP ) ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg ; Severe renal impairment estimate creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) &lt; 15 mL/min dialysis ; Known abnormal liver function prior randomization ( incl . hepatic disease biochemical evidence significant liver derangement know prior randomization ) . Other exclusion criterion Any follow abnormal local laboratory result prior randomization : 1 . Platelet count &lt; 50 x109/L 2 . Hemoglobin &lt; 8 mg/dL Unable provide write IC ; Female subject childbearing potential without use adequate contraception ( female childbearing potential define one postmenopausal least one year , surgically sterilise , hysterectomy least three month prior start study [ Visit 1 ] ) . Females take oral contraceptive therapy least three month . Adequate contraceptive include hormonal intrauterine device , hormonal contraceptive ( oral , depot , patch injectable ) , double barrier method condom diaphragms spermicidal gel foam . Pregnant breastfeeding subject ; Assessment subject likely comply study procedure complete followup ; Participating another clinical trial potentially interfere current study ; Previous randomization study ; Known drug alcohol dependence within past 12 month judge Investigator ; Life expectancy &lt; 12 month .</criteria>
