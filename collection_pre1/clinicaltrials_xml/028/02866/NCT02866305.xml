	<detailed_description>- Background Knowledge incidence , risk factor genetic predisposition primary spontaneous pneumothorax young adult limit , treatment also controversial . Typically , first incidence treat conservatively simple chest tube drainage disease reoccurs surgery consider . However , conventional treatment may associate increased morbidity , prolong hospitalization many young adult concerned high recurrence disease . The latter report many 25-35 % patient . Because spontaneous pneumothorax young adult usually associate apical bleb , investigator hypothesize primary surgery ( Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery = VATS ) resection bleb time first episode pneumothorax might effective first line treatment associate low morbidity short hospital stay , definite decline recurrence rate . - Method From July 2009 investigator conduct nationwide study , 300 consecutive patient admit Danish hospital primary spontaneous pneumothorax undergo high resolution CT thorax . Based upon CT patient randomise conventional conservative treatment ( chest tube drainage ) primary VATS bleb resection mechanical pleurodesis . Participants follow ten year . The primary endpoint ipsilateral recurrence pneumothorax . Secondary endpoint length hospitalization , duration chest tube drainage miscellaneous complication . Simultaneously , research biobank contain blood sample pulmonary tissue create future study biomarkers possible genetic cause . Finally , investigator conduct national epidemiological study , incidence Danish population investigate . *Perspective This study contribute new knowledge incidence , genetics best treatment primary spontaneous pneumothorax young adult impact future strategy understand treatment disease global level .</detailed_description>
