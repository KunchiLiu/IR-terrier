	<brief_summary>Patients receive chemotherapy regimen overall risk febrile neutropenia ≥ 20 % . The use web-application propose . They inform risk neutropenia , fever bleeding may occur beyond fifth day chemotherapy cycle ( eliminate fever related treatment ) . The temperature measurement perform home infrared forehead thermometer provide part study , systematic manner daily time day case unexplained fatigue chill . Before fever report physician via web-application ( alert ) , questionnaire complete patient search gravity criterion assess condition home . The patient hospitalize immediately show sign severity order document infection provide intravenous antibiotic adapt clinical condition ; absence sign , patient make count near lab receive oral antibiotic indicate . The subsequent strategy define web-application algorithm optimize care patient . The ability use web-application could allow early detection complication post-chemotherapy haematological toxicity offer take guide decision-making algorithm manage physician . The aim favour take home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hematological toxicity frequent sometimes severe complication chemotherapy use onco-hematology . The frequent neutropenia . It define Neutrophils rate lower 1 Giga/L . The patient risk fever serious infection require hospitalization , empiric antibiotic therapy sometimes dose reduction chemotherapy threaten patient future . Hospital overall mortality febrile neutropenia estimate 9.5 % . The growth factor allow reduce risk neutropenia shorten neutropenia . In general , suggest primary prophylaxis chemotherapy whose risk febrile neutropenia superior 20 % . However , 20 30 % post-chemotherapy fever document . A double early empiric antibiotic therapy decrease significantly risk mortality . Thrombocytopenia le frequent complication neutropenia risk spontaneous bleed patient platelet rate 10 Giga/L . The patient inform begin take care neutropenia risk , fever hemorrhagic event happen home two chemotherapy . The patient center take care must report quickly fever bleed happen chemotherapy evaluate risk immediate complication propose appropriate therapeutic strategy . However many patient one two hematological complication chemotherapy n't take care optimally adapt delay . The use web-application could allow febrile patient chemotherapy benefit personalize care quicker communication clinical symptom blood test result oncologist via tool . In practice , patient n't always contact oncologist case fever . On hand , delay transmission biological test medical team n't always allow optimal take care appropriate delay hematological toxicity febrile event patient chemotherapy . The possibility use web-application could allow detect earlier possible complication post-chemotherapy hematological toxicity suggest take care guide decisional algorithm manage oncologist . The aim privilege care home . The expected benefit patient earlier adapt care case infection and/or bleed . The use web-application could allow , optimize care chemotherapy-induced neutropenia , limit number hospitalization prescription intravenous antibiotic achieve optimally therapeutic project . The usual monitoring ( oral advice ) would propose patient include study . It unlikely post-chemotherapy fever , neutropenia thrombocytopenia support later usual practice . Therefore expect use web-application benefit patient allow detect earlier post-chemotherapy complication propose optimal take care include patient . Patient must chemotherapy schema global risk febrile neutropenia &lt; 20 % could use web-application . Patients inform risk neutropenia , fever bleeding could happen beyond 5th day chemotherapy . Temperature take home infrared forehead thermometer provide study systematic day time case unusual fatigue chill . When fever detect web-application , questionnaire complete patient find serious symptom . The aim optimize take care patient .</detailed_description>
