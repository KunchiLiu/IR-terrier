	<brief_summary>Emotion-related brain activation make visible patient via neurofeedback aim improve discriminability emotional arousal emotion regulation . With functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , information current brain activation image feed back patient via visual display . Patients borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) usually hyper-activate brain region associate emotion . In study , BPD patient provide neurofeedback amygdala , crucial processing emotion . The aim study observe , whether amygdala-neurofeedback would help BPD patient improve emotion regulation . Compared control condition , improve brain self-regulation emotion regulation expect three neurofeedback train session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Neural Responding BPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients BPD show increased emotional reactivity , slow return baseline , severe emotion dysregulation symptom . On neural level , BPD patient hyper-activate amygdala hypo-activate prefrontal cortex response emotional stimulus . The prefrontal cortex amygdala crucial node brain 's emotion regulation network thus assume , dysregulation within network key BPD symptom . Psychotherapy treatment specialize BPD teach patient monitor emotional arousal develop emotion regulation skill . However long run despite important therapeutic advance , majority BPD patient keep report significant impairment function psychotherapy . To explore new type therapy BPD , investigator apply real-time fMRI neurofeedback , patient provide brain activation via visual display . In previous work find BPD patient healthy participant down-regulate amygdala activation real-time fMRI neurofeedback , increase connectivity amygdala prefrontal cortex . Yet , yet fully understand potential effect amygdala neurofeedback emotion . BPD patient ( n=25 ) participate three-session fMRI neurofeedback train 2-7 day session ( within 2 week ) . The effect training measure training . Primarily , investigator expect improvement emotion regulation , secondarily , reduction BPD symptom expect . Hypotheses : With fMRI neurofeedback , BPD patient improve significantly self-report psychophysiological measure emotion regulation fMRI neurofeedback training . BPD patient show significantly reduce symptom severity self-report measure neurofeedback train .</detailed_description>
