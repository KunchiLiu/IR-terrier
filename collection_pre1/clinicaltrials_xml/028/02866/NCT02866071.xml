	<brief_summary>STUDY SYNOPSIS Objectives The primary objective estimate proportion subject report clinically important reduction pain score ( define 2 point 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale ) receive fentanyl ( 50mcg ) without intranasal ( IN ) ketamine ( 50mg ) prior hospital arrival treatment acute traumatic pain . Design Outcomes This prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled single-site clinical trial . The primary outcome variable reduction report pain least 2 point ( 0-10 Verbal Numerical Rating Scale1,2 ) compare pretreatment pain score pain score obtain upon reassessment 30 minute medication administration . Secondary outcome include : reduction report pain Emergency Department ( ED ) arrival ; incidence adverse event ; additional opiate requirement prior ED arrival first three hour ED care ; development chronic pain ( measure Brief Pain Inventory,3 ) post-traumatic stress disorder ( measure PTSD Checklist DSM-54 ) overall satisfaction life ( measure Satisfaction With Life Scale5 ) 90-days injury . Interventions Duration Adults qualify prehospital pain treatment paramedic stand order screen inclusion , eligible , undergo IRB-approved consent process concurrent receive 50mcg fentanyl ( IV IN per current standard practice ) . Consenting subject 1:1 randomize receive either 50mg IN ketamine IN placebo . Pain rat 0-10 scale subject prior treatment , 30 minute follow treatment , ED arrival , 30 minute interval first three hour ED care . Additional pain medication give prior hospital arrival within first three hour ED care also record . The primary outcome reduction baseline pain pretreatment measurement 30 minute medication administration . Overall satisfaction life symptom PTSD chronic pain assess hospital disposition ( in-person ) via phone follow-up 90-days ( +/- 14 day ) injury . Sample size Power The Investigators consider two point reduction pain clinically significant , thus compare proportion subject achieve two point reduction pain 30 minute post-medication administration treatment group control group . Sample size consideration base primary analysis . To test hypothesis proportion treat fentanyl alone least 2 point reduction pain low proportion treat combination fentanyl single-dose ketamine 2 point reduction pain , investigator use chi-square test ( Fisher 's Exact Test appropriate ) . An intent treat approach use . It expect response rate two group 40 % 60 % , respectively . These estimate base response rate study compare pain management efficacy subject treat morphine alone morphine plus ketamine . With magnitude effect , sample size 97 per group 80 % power detect difference two group critical level significance set 5 % . To allow subject drop-out , protocol deviation , miss outcome data , investigator plan enroll additional 15 % arm , total 224 subject .</brief_summary>
