	<brief_summary>The trial recruit 120 patient ; 90 ovarian clear cell carcinoma 30 endometrial clear cell carcinoma . Patients randomise chemotherapy Nintedanib 200mg twice daily oral administration ( PO ) continuously . The primary diagnosis must histologically confirm central pathological review present tumour biopsy relapse disease must find least 50 % clear cell carcinoma serous differentiation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Nintedanib Compared To Chemotherapy Patients With Recurrent Clear Cell Carcinoma Of The Ovary Or Endometrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clear cell carcinoma ( CCC ) uncommon histotype ovarian rare histotype endometrial cancer . The prognosis recurrent disease poor response rate standard chemotherapy &lt; 10 % urgent need novel therapy . Ovarian CCC ( OCCC ) biologically different ovarian cancer histotypes share feature renal CCC , include upregulation angiogenesis pathway . Hence inhibition angiogenesis , successful strategy renal CCC , may also benefit OCCC endometrial CCC ( ECCC ) . Nintedanib well-tolerated , potent , orally-available , kinase inhibitor target Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGFR ) 1-3 , Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor ( PDGFR ) α/β , Firbroblas Gworth Factor Receptors ( FGFR ) 1-3 . It license Europe combination docetaxel first line chemotherapy Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . Importantly also significant activity single agent renal CCC Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) 20.3 % , disease control rate 76. % 43 % 9 month progression free survival . Response rate ( RR ) ovarian CCC standard chemotherapy without platinum poor whatever line treatment . A number different agent use recurrent CCC , although isolated instance response variety agent report , regimen seem offer particular advantage . As result investigator expect see significant difference response rate within chemotherapy arm study . Hence feasible allow physician choice chemotherapy pre-specified selection include patient multiple previous relapse . Since overall progression free survival may shorter successive line treatment , number previous line treatment stratification factor . These measure maximise recruitment rare tumour sub-type across different country .</detailed_description>
