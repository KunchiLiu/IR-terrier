	<brief_title>The Pelvic Floor Muscles Strength Sexual Function Primigravid Non-pregnant Nulliparous</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational cross-sectional study . The sample consist 161 woman divide two group : first pregnant woman , form 81 primigravida participant Prenatal Program public health system Uberlandia city ( Brazil ) . The second consist 80 non-pregnant nulliparous . All participant sign informed consent study approve Ethics Committee Federal University Uberlandia ( nº 145.623/2012 ) . To estimate average strength vaginal palpation vaginal squeeze pressure primigravid , investigator use follow equation scale sample : Zα/2 refers probability ( α/2 ) standard one-tailed normal distribution ; σ2 variance associate vaginal palpation vaginal squeeze pressure ; ε sample error . Based similar study , evaluate similar population , assume : α=0.05 , σ=1.34 ε=0.32 vaginal palpation ; assume : α=0.05 , σ=12.60 ε=3.00 vaginal squeeze pressure . Therefore , sample size would 67 68 woman , respectively . The PFM assessment PFM evaluation perform vaginal palpation vaginal squeeze pressure . These method widely use research involve female pelvic floor many study show reproducibility validity . The examiner conduct evaluation start study , reproducibility test . Ten woman evaluate twice , interval one week determine intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) variable . The participant ask health history . After check eligible participate survey , participant invite empty bladder remain supine position hip knees flexed foot prop . Assessments begin explain perform contraction PFM volunteer advise stay relaxed breathe normally . The vaginal palpation always first exam check PFM contraction ability hold vaginal squeeze pressure exam . During vaginal palpation examiner quantify strength . The physiotherapist introduce index middle finger 4cm inside vagina , request hold maximum contraction PFM , accord instruction movement `` inward '' great possible strength . Muscle function classify Oxford Scale Modified , varies zero ( absence muscle contraction ) five ( strong contraction finger suck evaluator ) . To consider valid , movement cranial elevation observe examiner , well absence visible contraction adductor muscle hip , gluteus abdominal . The vaginal squeeze pressure measure perineometer equip vaginal probe cover non-lubricated condom probe lubricate hypoallergenic gel . The probe sensor connect microprocessor hand latex tube , allow measurement nip pressure centimeter water . To obtain measurement , subject remain position vaginal sensor introduce approximately 4cm vaginal cavity . The woman orient motivate verbally perform three voluntary maximal contraction sustain five second one minute interval . For statistical analysis , investigator use mean three peak pressure provide equipment . Sexual function assessment Sexual function evaluate Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) questionnaire , validate Portuguese version , easy understand language subsequently apply exclusively Brazilian pregnant woman . The questionnaire consist 19 multiple-choice question , involve six sexual response domain : desire , arousal , lubrication , orgasm , satisfaction pain . The score question individual , vary 0 6 point . The investigator perform mathematical calculation , allow acquisition ﬁnal index , total score FSFI . The total score FSFI range 2 36 point . The low score , bad sexual function . The assessment period last four week . At time interview , pregnant woman instruct regard completion enough time fill self-administered way reserve place . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences software ( SPSSV21 , Chicago , IL ) . Data normality test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . To perform variable comparison , Mann-Whitney test performed . To verify correlation variable , Spearman correlation test use . Values p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . The intensity relationship correlation coefficient value interpret accord follow guideline : 0 = zero ; 0.10-0.39 = weak ; 0.40-0.69 = moderate ; 0.70-0.99 = strong , 1 = perfect , regardless whether positive negative .</detailed_description>
