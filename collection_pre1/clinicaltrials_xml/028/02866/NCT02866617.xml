	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Of Oral Health-Related Quality Of Life In Patients Wearing Vacuum Formed Thermoplastic Retainers Constructed On Conventional Stone Models And On 3D Reconstructed Orthodontic Study Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : To compare impact 2 type vacuum form thermoplastic retainer patient . Objectives : 1 . To compare oral health-related quality life patient wear vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct conventional orthodontic study model reconstruct 3D study model 6 month . 2 . To compare compliance vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct conventional orthodontic study model reconstruct 3D study model 6 month . 3 . To compare stability patient wear vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct conventional orthodontic study model reconstruct 3D study model 6 month . Research Methadology Ethical Consideration : Application ethical approval Medical Ethics Committee , Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya . Study population This randomize control clinical trial include exist patient visit Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya , fix orthodontic treatment due fix appliance remove . 5.2 Sample Size Estimation Sample size estimation base previous study do Jäderberg et al ( 2012 ) calculate use PS Software ( Power Sample Size Calculation ) . A sample size calculation perform base alpha significance level 0.05 beta 0.1 achieve 90 per cent power detect clinically meaningful difference 1.0 mm [ standard deviation ( SD ) 1.0 ] group . The sample size calculation reveal 22 pair sample sufficient . This number sample size also achieve moderate Pearson Product Moment correlation two group . However , compensate possible dropout , 30 pair enrol clinical trial . 5.4 Materials method 1 . Enrollment &amp; Randomization Potential subject recruit patient receive orthodontic treatment Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya . Patients screen base schedule debonding inclusion exclusion criterion list . An online random number generator use create randomization list study number match either Group A Group B . The day debonding potential subject give consent officially enrol study . 2 . Study Groups As flow chart illustrate , two study group exist randomized cross-over observational study . Each study group receive 3 set vacuum form thermoplastic retainer . Group A wear vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct laboratory technician accord standard protocol 1 week day debond , vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct stone study model one dentist 1 week debond 3 month later vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct 3D reconstruct study model another 3 month . Group B wear vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct laboratory technician accord standard protocol 1 week day debond , vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct 3D reconstruct study model one dentist 1 week debond 3 month later vacuum form thermoplastic retainer construct stone study model another 3 month . 3 . Study Visit # 1- Debonding Appointment All subject debonded resident doctor , residual composite remove , teeth appropriately polish . Final photo take per University Clinic protocol . After debond , maxillary mandibular alginate impression ( Hydrogum 5 , Zhermack , Italy ) obtain sample ; two work model one study model ) . One set impression send University 's Orthodontic Laboratory construction vacuum form thermoplastic retainer laboratory technician 1st appliance ( issue day debond ) . The vacuum form thermoplastic retainer make lab use thermoplastic material clinic 's Biostar machine available lab use standard instruction provide manufacturer . vacuum form thermoplastic retainer cool trim accordingly . Clinically vacuum form thermoplastic retainer evaluate resident doctor intra orally adjust patient comfort . All subject instruct wear retainer full time , remove eat , brush , clean . For remain two set impression , impression pour dental stone within 24hours . 4 . Acquisition stone study model . Impressions obtain disinfect casting . The white stone ( Elite Ortho , Zhermack , Italy ) mix tapped impression little time ensure air trap within stone mix stone use form base . Once stone set sufficiently , impression invert base . When cast low impression , stone lingual section remove set fully ensure impression easily remove model . Once base fully set impression carefully remove stone gradually lift model use plaster knife . The result stone model trim use model trimmer . The base model parallel occlusal plane trim ensure even adaption thermoforming material . The back edge model trim 90° sagittal plane . The labial buccal side model trim round final model 'D ' shape . 5 : Acquisition digital model . Conventional study model scan use structure light scanner ( Maestro 3D , Age Solutions , Inc , Italy ) via EasyDentalScan software ( Age Solutions , Inc ) produce 3D digital model . The scanned data upper low conventional study model save exported binary stereolithographic ( .stl ) file . 6 : Acquisition reconstruct model . A Fused Deposition Modelling ( FDM ) machine ( UP ! 2 Plus 3D Printer ) contain acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) plastic use construct replica ( RP ) model digital file accord manufacturing instruction . This process do CBMTI SDN BHD ( subsidiary UM CAPITAL BERHAD ) , Institute Postgraduate Studies , University Malaya . The prototyping process begin unwind feedstock filament reel feed liquefier locate inside system work envelop , show figure , get gradually heat temperature gradient provide number coil wrap helically axis liquefier . The heat liquefier melt plastic filament deposit melt nozzle attach exit control diameter final extrudate . Two step motor entrance liquefier make sure continuous supply material model build-up . The nozzle liquefier assembly mount onto mechanical stage numerically control X-Y plane . Upon receipt precise tool path prepare Insight software , nozzle move foam substrate depositing thin bead thermoplastic model material along necessary support structure . Deposition fine extrude filament onto substrate produce layer correspond slice CAD model object . Once layer build substrate move z direction order prepare stage deposition next layer . The deposited filament cool immediately glass transition temperature polymer get harden . The entire build system contain within temperature- control environment temperature glass-transition temperature polymer provide efficient intra-layer bonding . 7 : Acquisition vacuum form thermoplastic retainer Each VFR construct Erkodur blank ( Erkodent , Erich Kopp , GmbH , Pfalzgrafenweiler , Germany ) 1.5 mm thickness use standard instruction provide laboratory 's Biostar machine . Retainer Designs : vacuum form thermoplastic retainer Designs- Extraction Non-extraction Cases - Upper- Trimmed 1-2mm facial gingival coverage , palatal coverage , 2nd Molar occlusal coverage - Lower- Trimmed 1-2mm facial lingual gingival coverage , 2nd Molar occlusal coverage . 8 : T2 T3 visit : Issuing vacuum form thermoplastic retainer . The 2nd retainer fit within 1 week debond ( T1 ) 3rd retainer fit 3 month ( T2 ) debond . The duration retainer wear standardize base standard protocol retainer wear practice . The patient instruct wear vacuum form thermoplastic retainer 24 hour day first week remove eat brush teeth . After first week , wear time reduce 10 hour day ( Thickett Power , 2009 ) . All patient provide standardized oral write instruction use retainer one dentist . The subject review member research team 2 interval , 3 month ( T2 ) 6 month ( T3 ) debond . At 3 month ( T2 ) review appointment , subject give Questionnaire Q2 fill . Later , 3rd retainer give subject review 3 month ( T3 ) 3rd retainer issue ( 6 month debond ) questionnaire Q3 administer .</detailed_description>
