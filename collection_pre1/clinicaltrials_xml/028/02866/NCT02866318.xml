	<brief_title>Learning Curve CUSUM LV Ejection Fraction Visual Estimation Novice Practitioners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eight EM resident experience echocardiography prior study recruit analysis echocardiographic image file . They receive echocardiography interpretation skill train include one hour lecture . Twenty echocardiography video file provide training session , instructed estimate EF look LV contractility without take measurement . This procedure take less 2 minute case . An evaluation form complete EP . EF estimate qualitatively ( Normal / Global hypokinesia ) , RWMA quantitatively ( % ) EP echocardiographic certification ( cardiologist ) . An echocardiography perform M7RÂ® model ultrasound machine report experienced echocardiographers use MSM . The echocardiography result report blinded study . A participant estimate EF base complete assessment LV wall motion include parasternal long-axis , short-axis , apical four chamber view except MSM . And , participant write EF ( % ) region WMA visual assessment check Normal wall motion Global hypokinesia EF report paper .</detailed_description>
