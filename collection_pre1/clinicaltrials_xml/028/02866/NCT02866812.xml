	<brief_summary>During last decade , embolization become treatment choice rupture intracranial aneurysm , improve neurological outcome patient . At time , safety , also become technique allow prophylactic treatment unruptured intracranial aneurysm discover incidentally imaging exam . Regarding patient rupture intracranial aneurysm , patient survive often reduce quality life one two good neurological outcome embolization . Depression , anxiety fatigue , whose psycho-social impact important , often cite . This description often do without consider realize type treatment ( surgery embolization ) mostly neurological functional status patient remotely ( disability daily activity ) . Regarding patient unruptured intracranial aneurysm , mostly asymptomatic embolization program . They would present cognitive impairment one case five 1 month treatment . If depression , fatigue difficult return work life logically find patient severe sequela ( disability daily activity ) rupture intracranial aneurysm , question arises patient rupture intracranial aneurysm favorable evolution asymptomatic patient unruptured intracranial aneurysm . A precise status population necessary , especially discovery treatment intracranial aneurysm often early ( 40 60 year ) good neurological status allow `` priori '' return easily active life .</brief_summary>
