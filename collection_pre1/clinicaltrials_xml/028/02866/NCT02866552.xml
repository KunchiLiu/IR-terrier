	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) auto-immune orphan disease mainly characterize alteration microvascular network , cutaneous visceral fibrosis . Hands frequently affect , consequence ischemic phenomenon cutaneous fibrosis . As result , patient suffer everyday disability , consequence occupational activity social contact , sometimes severely alter quality life . To date , anti-fibrosis treatment proven effective ; exist vasodilation treatment unfortunately effective , associated adverse effect restriction . It consequently utmost importance effective treatment sclerodermic hand develop . The injection adipose autologous tissue common practice plastic surgery , known century . Adipose tissue , originally use increase volume , also characterize trophic property associate stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) , contain multipotent stem cell , capable tissue repair . Interestingly , SVF cell angiogenic anti-inflammatory , could improve damage see SSc . The injection SVF finger would also make possible control production extracellular matrix improve balance fibrosis fibrolysis , result improvement cutaneous sclerosis The main purpose evaluate efficacy SVF injection finger patient suffer SSc Cochin hand functional scale evaluate 12 month , comparison control group .</brief_summary>
