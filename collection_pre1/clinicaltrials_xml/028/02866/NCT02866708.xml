	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate treatment effect INP wound heal tissue perfusion large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This randomized cross-over pilot study look effect intermittent negative pressure ( INP ) therapy wound heal peripheral macro- microcirculation spinal cord injure patient chronic leg foot ulcer ( 6 week inclusion ) . The project design randomized clinical trial single-subject multiple baseline design . We perform convenience sample spinal cord injure patient leg foot ulcer , last recruitment end december 2016.To ensure equal distribution participant study arm , perform block randomization . A statistician randomized patient either intervention arm control arm start study : At baseline , participant randomize either A ) 8 week without intervention OR B ) 8 week start INP therapy 2 hour per day divide 2-3 timed section . After 8 week , participant control group ( A ) re-examined , start 8-week INP therapy . Also intervention ( INP ) subject low limb individual throughout study period . The leg act intra-individual control . At baseline ( week 0 ) , course study ( every 4th week ) , participant ' wound measure wound nurse . Baseline ( start INP therapy ) intervention follow measure perform : Demographic data ( weight , height , ABI ) , Segmental pulse-volume-recording , Segmental skin perfusion pressure laser Doppler sensor pressure cuff evaluate reactive hyperemia ( Sensilase , Väsamed ) health survey ( SF-36/EQ-5D-5L customize wound questionnaire ) similar examine baseline end study period . Otivio AS supplied FlowOx device provide necessary training perform project . Outcome variable assess study period : wound healing ( primary endpoint ) , quality life ( secondary endpoint ) , skin perfusion pressure ( secondary endpoint ) , ankle-brachial pressure ( secondary endpoint ) segmental pulse-volume recording ( secondary endpoint ) . The aim project prospectively examine elucidate effect intermittent negative pressure therapy apply limited part lower limb clinically relevant measure relate wound heal peripheral macro- microcirculation patient spinal cord injury . The hypothesis study : - Application INP patient spinal cord injury , use FlowOx™ device , improve wound heal foot compare treatment ( baseline ) compare standard wound care alone . - Application INP patient spinal cord injury , use FlowOx™ device , improve macro- microcirculation foot compare treatment ( baseline ) compare standard wound care alone patient spinal cord injury . - Application INP patient spinal cord injury , use FlowOx™ device , improve macro- microcirculation intervention foot compare control foot compare standard wound care alone patient spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
