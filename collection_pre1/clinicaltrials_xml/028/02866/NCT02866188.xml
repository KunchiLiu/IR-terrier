	<brief_title>The Feasibility Study Recognition Cardiac Arrest Using Smart Watch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Korea , out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) occur twenty thousand person per year , among sixty percent occur home . We already know survivor rate neurological outcome OHCA patient close relation initial emergency management field , like bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , Basic Life Support ( BLS ) , etc . However , Korea , witness almost bystander CPR BLS field highly trained rescuer arrive . So , total survivor rate 2.4 % irrespective neurologic outcome Korea . Generally , Korea , begin bystander CPR progress throughout dispatcher 's instruction emergency response system . This system OHCA patient activate witness recognize cardiac arrest call emergency response system . Therefore , cardiac arrest recognition witness important . However , conventional recognition cardiac arrest field often difficult , monitoring device , healthcare provider . The conventional recognition method cardiac arrest firstly check mental status , secondly check pulse patient 's carotid artery self-respiration . This method difficult witness , especially general person . Even , difficult emergency physician , . Consequentially , recognition cardiac arrest witness generally delay , golden-time run highly trained rescuer arrive . An average arrival time highly trained rescuer eight ten minute . A hypoxic brain damage begin four minute cardiac arrest . As result , delayed time already pass four minute cardiac arrest . So , survivor rate neurologic outcome good enough . In study , want find whether recognition cardiac arrest use smart watch feasible . If idea possible , recognition cardiac arrest use smart watch easy fast witness , like general person . By use smart watch , emergency response system cardiac arrest bystander CPR BLS begin earlier use conventional cardiac arrest recognition method field .</detailed_description>
