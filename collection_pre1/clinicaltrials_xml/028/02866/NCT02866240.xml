	<brief_summary>This single site , non-randomized , prospective , open-label , interventional pilot/feasibility study . Patients recruit medically-refractory focal neocortical epilepsy , define basis presence focal spike ( available ) focal seizure onset originate lateral cortical surface lobe . Patients recruit epilepsy clinic Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) , home institution principal investigator . All patient refer physician request maintain current antiepileptic drug throughout study change enrollment permit maintain pre-enrollment drug level , clinically necessary . The primary outcome measure change seizure frequency ( seizures/4-week period ) compare baseline . Secondary outcome measure include change interictal discharge burden , change cortical excitability , quality life measure . Patients medically-refractory neocortical epilepsy receive cathodal tDCS administer seizure focus 10 session 2-week period allowance make-up session week three .

	<detailed_description>Noninvasive neurostimulation technique include Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . Of , tDCS uniquely suited mass distribution treatment , even home , lightweight , portable , inexpensive favorable safety profile . In tDCS , low intensity ( 1-2 mA ) unidirectional electrical current apply scalp influence underlie cortical excitability . Some small preliminary study suggest cathodal tDCS may suppress epileptic seizure [ 1,2 ] . However , well-powered randomized-controlled trial demonstrate convince proof efficacy conduct . This study intend test whether tDCS reduces seizures patient intractable focal neocortical epilepsy . The hypothesis repeat daily session cathodal tDCS lead clinically significant decrease seizures population . Successful completion pilot study essential first step toward large placebo-controlled trial goal establish cathodal tDCS novel , non-invasive inexpensive treatment drug-resistant seizure , provide critical data need application obtain FDA approval use tDCS treatment drug-resistant epilepsy . tDCS painless method focal brain stimulation . tDCS base decades-old observation neuronal firing modulate low amplitude electrical direct current ( DC ) . Specifically , apply cerebral cortex , cathodal DC inhibit neuronal fire [ 3,4 ] . The mechanisms cathodal DC reduce neuronal fire likely relate hyper‚Äêpolarization soma membrane occur apical dendrite neuron orient toward cathode constant electric field [ 5 ] . The practical application tDCS simple : low amplitude DC administer via scalp electrode cerebral cortex expose cathodal DC beneath one electrode , return ( anodal ) electrode place anywhere else body , complex arrangement minimize current one site . tDCS method also recently adapt rat work disease model show success seizure suppression [ 6,7 ] . Hundreds tDCS trial demonstrate technique well tolerate safe . Direct electrical current stimulation presently FDA-approved extracranial use , FDA application cranial stimulation ( tDCS ) management mood disorder chronic pain progress . tDCS unit also inexpensive light-weight . The electrical supply derive conventional 9-volt battery . The scalp electrode fasten second . tDCS combine easily therapy , may require resuscitation acutely-injured patient . tDCS presently investigation treatment epilepsy , excess cortical excitability prominent feature disease process , neuronal inhibition may beneficial . Thus epilepsy , tDCS may offer practical non-pharmacologic therapy large minority , approximately 35 % , patient whose seizure control medication . The tDCS stimulator use clinical study STARSTIM device ( Neuroelectrics , Inc ) . STARSTIM capable record EEG , tDCS stimulation , allow detailed understanding tDCS-induced effect neural activity , may eventually serve guidance fine-tune stimulation parameter improve tDCS protocol base developmental , behavioral , dynamical , disease state closed-loop system . Starstim device remotely control use NIC software stand Neuroelectrics Instrument Controller ( NIC ) . This application allow physician configure study protocol define parameter . The provided version software enable apply tDCS protocols subject study .</detailed_description>
