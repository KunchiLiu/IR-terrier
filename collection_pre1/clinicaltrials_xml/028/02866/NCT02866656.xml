	<brief_title>The Clinical Research Low Intensity Continuous Ultrasonic Lower Limb Arteriosclerosis Occlusion（ASO） Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound form sound whose frequency high natural audible range human ( &gt; 20 kHz ) ultrasonography widely use diagnostic device several decade . In addition diagnostic purpose , ultrasound clinically use therapeutic application , include tumor ablation , thrombolysis , bone regeneration , facilitate drug delivery . Recently , therapeutic angiogenic effect low-intensity ultrasound report endothelial cell , chick chorioallantoic membrane , rat model hind limb ischemia . investigator hypothesis low-intensity ultrasound improve ailment ASO . In present study , evaluate efficacy safety low intensity ultrasonic ASO , explore noninvasive auxiliary treatment ASO . 90 patient randomly divide 2 group : A ) control group，patients give Conventional conservative treatment : B）treatment group，patients give Conventional conservative treatment low intensity ultrasonic treatment ; Treatments last 4 week , three time week , stimulation give 8 minute every time , location treatment low limb ischemia area surround tissues；outcome indicator record Before 4 week trial , The Walking Impairment Questionnaire ( WIQ ) , ankle brachial ratio , farthest distance Walking , percutaneous tissue oxygen tension , tissue oxygenation index recovery time , local skin temperature , ultrasonic blood vessel , muscle enzyme , hepatic kidney function . investigator speculate 4 week Low intensity ultrasonic treatment , observation index ASO patient improve ; meanwhile , creatine kinase , liver kidney function , blood urine routine , electrocardiogram ( ecg ) obvious change .</detailed_description>
