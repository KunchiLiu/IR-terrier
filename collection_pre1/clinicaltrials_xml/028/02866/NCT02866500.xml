	<brief_summary>Context : oral cancer 5th cancer order frequency human France . It country mortality oral cancer raise Europe . The frequent location concern oral cavity prevalency one high world . The main risk factor tobacco alcohol . The oral cancer treat great majority case radiotherapy go pull xerostomy , responsible degradation oral state . Furthermore , increase risk appearance osteoradionecrosis ( ORN ) patient carrier buccal lesion and\or undergo surgical act . Consequently , initial oral state patient estimate eliminate source infection . An unfavourable initial state increase risk degradation one appearance ORN . However , present epidemiological data available concern oral state patient present oral cancer . Objective : main objective study describe , radiotherapy , oral state patient present oral cancer follow evolution oral state three year register patient quality life . The secondary objective describe distribution risk factor degradation oral state ( oral hygiene , food habit , xerostomy , consumption tobacco alcohol ) population register impact dental restoration radiological assessment . Methods : prospective epidemiological study observation realize service odontology Timone hospital ( Marseille , France ) association service ORL maxillofacial surgery Timone well service radiotherapy medical oncology Timone Paoli Calmettes institute ( IPC ) . All toothed patient affected oral cancer untreated include , treat surgically , 18 year old initial dental assessment realize . The main assessment criterion CAD index parodontal state . Expected result perspective : This study allow epidemiological data concern patient ' oral state affect oral cancer radiotherapy . It allow set consensus good practice .</brief_summary>
