	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate brain responds low blood glucose non-diabetic individual . The ultimate goal understand brain substrates hypoglycemia unawareness , condition occur patient type1 diabetes undergoing insulin treatment.In present study , investigator focus difference two group non-diabetic subject : one group experience two episode hypoglycemia day prior study ( supposedly develop level unawareness hypoglycemia ) , one group . In study , 3 tesla MRI scanner use acquire brain image . The imaging system identical one use hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypoglycemia , also call low blood glucose low blood sugar , occur blood glucose drop normal level . When blood glucose start drop , body reacts drop , try restore blood glucose level . Symptoms hypoglycemia usually easily recognize . Hypoglycemia treat quickly easily eat drink small amount glucose-rich food . However people long history diabetes impair response hypoglycemia therefore n't recognize symptom hypoglycemia , condition call hypoglycemia unawareness . If treat hypoglycemia get bad cause confusion , clumsiness , faint etc . Currently , fully understood brain area involve sense drop glucose level . Absence knowledge critical barrier design monitor effective intervention strategy avoid and/or reverse hypoglycemia unawareness . The purpose study investigate brain responds low blood glucose non-diabetic individual . Specific focus give difference two group non-diabetic subject : one group experience two episode hypoglycemia day prior study ( therefore supposedly develop level unawareness hypoglycemia ) , one group .</detailed_description>
