	<criteria>1 . Patients plan undergo ESD treatment superficial esophageal cancer 2 . Patients age ≥20 year time consent 3 . Patients clinical metastasis ( cN0M0 ) cervical abdominal CT 4 . Patients endoscopically diagnose depth wall invasion remain epithelium ( EP ) lamina propria mucosa ( LPM ) 5 . Patients ≥3/4 circumference length &lt; 8 cm 6 . If patient multiple lesion , circumference minor lesion one lesion large circumference ( major lesion ) must &lt; 1/2 , distance minor lesion major lesion must 5 cm major axis . 7 . Patients squamous cell carcinoma ( include highgrade intraepithelial neoplasia ) confirm biopsy 8 . Patients whose lesion confirm localized thoracic esophagus ( lesion cervical esophagus abdominal esophagus exclude ) . The location lesion determine endoscopy . 9 . Patients receive pretreatment esophageal cancer . Treatment ESD superficial esophageal cancer depth wall invasion assess remain epithelium ( EP ) lamina propria mucosa ( LPM ) include definition pretreatment . However , patient scar due previous ESD major minor lesion exclude study . 10 . Patients ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 1 11 . Patients commonly use endoscope tip diameter 8.9 mm pas 12 . Patients dysphagia score 0 13 . Patients whose laboratory value within 28 day enrolment meet follow criterion : White blood cell count : ≥4,000/µL Platelet count : ≥100,000/µL AST : ≤100 IU/L ALT : ≤100 IU/L Total bilirubin : ≤2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine : ≤2.0 mg/dL 14 . Patients receive sufficient explanation study provide write voluntary consent 1 . Patients cardiac disease ( myocardial infarction , unstable angina , heart failure ) , renal disease ( nephrotic syndrome kidney failure ) , poorly control diabetes mellitus 2 . Patients active ( within 1 year ) malignancy esophageal cancer 3 . Patients active bacterial , fungal , viral infection 4 . Patients treat corticosteroid 5 . Patients positive HBs antigen , positive HCV antibody , positive HIV antibody , positive HTLV antibody , positive Treponema pallidum ( tested screening ) . For patient positive HBc/HBs antibody , HBVDNA test performed ( result negative , patient allow enter study ) . 6 . Patients mental disorder difficult control 7 . Pregnant woman , lactate woman , potentially pregnant woman Lactating woman may enrol study discontinue lactation period transplantation confirm wound healing . Women childbearing potential must agree use follow birth control method completely abstain sexual intercourse period consent participate study end study participation . Principal birth control method : oral contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device include intrauterine luteal hormonereleasing system , tubal occlusion , vasectomized partner Supportive birth control method : condom diaphragms The use principal birth control method essential . Supportive birth control method use alone must use together principal birth control method . For oral contraceptive , change birth control method strategy consider known effect reduce miss concomitantly take certain type drug dietary supplement . 8 . Patients participate another clinical study within 6 month , participate another clinical study , plan participate another clinical study participation Study CLS2702ESO01 9 . Patients tissue collect due disease ( e.g. , stomatitis , erosion , mass , blister ) oral mucosa tissue collection site 10 . Patients history hypersensitivity antibiotic preparation ( ampicillin sodium , sulbactam sodium , streptomycin sulfate , gentamicin sulfate , amphotericin B ) take drug may affect study ( within 28 day enrolment ) 11 . Patients undergone radiotherapy cervical upper abdominal region , surgery head neck cancer may affect assessment ESD stenotic symptom 12 . Patients whose swallow function markedly reduce completely lose due sequela cerebral infarction reason 13 . Patients porcine latex allergy 14 . Patients , opinion treat physician , eligible study due reason describe</criteria>
