	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , single-arm , phase II interventional clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety Icotinib neoadjuvant treatment patient IIIA- IIIB NSCLC activate EGFR mutation exon 19 21 . Sixty-seven resectable stage IIIA- IIIB NSCLC patient EGFR activate ( 19/21 ) mutation eligible enrol . EGFR mutation prospectively test participant ' biopsy sample confirm surgical resect sample . Neoadjuvant treatment phase : Eligible patient receive 125mg Icotinib three time per day . Treatment schedule continue disease progression unbearable toxicity appear . Surgery treatment phase : Tumor response evaluate CT scan 8 week induction treatment . The patient responsive disease consider technique resectable undergo resection . Post-surgery phase : It discretion investigator whether patient candidate post-operative treatment consider best interest patient . It recommend patient positive margin residual tumor surgery receive radiation therapy . Patients surgery receive long-term follow-up -- chest CT scan，abdominal abdominal ultrasound every 3 month , brain MRI every 6 month , bone scan ( ECT ) every 12 month -- 5 year .</brief_summary>
