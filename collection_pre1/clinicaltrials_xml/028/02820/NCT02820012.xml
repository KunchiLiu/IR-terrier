	<brief_summary>Although practice many year , surgical correction scoliosis relatively subject publish idiopathic scoliosis publish type scoliosis . This study involve creation observatory patient undergoing scoliosis ST2R reduction technique ( Simultaneous Translation Two Rods ) associate PASS ® system . The main objective analyze three-dimensional correction deformity intervention maintenance time depend etiology scoliosis . This research conduct pediatric surgery service specialize technique . Correcting radiographic parameter directly relate surgical procedure . The quality life patient indirectly affect surgery . Secondary objective analyze surgical technique evaluate impact quality life patient . This study firstly well understanding : - Scoliosis child adolescents surgical treatment ; - The impact surgical procedure ST2R technique three-dimensional correction , patient 's quality life ; secondly , good management patient require surgery scoliosis well public health impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The correction deformity three plane space main goal surgical treatment child 's scoliosis adolescent . The technique provide satisfactory correction deformity coronal plane remain insufficient sagittal plane particular correction thoracic hypokyphosis . Dr. Clarke team show ST2R reduction technique ( Simultaneous Translation Two Rods ) associate PASS ® system give good correction thoracic hypokyphosis idiopathic scoliosis . The result single-center study show ST2R technique allow restore normal thoracic kyphosis average gain 23 ° patient preoperatively hypokyphosis , high gain make technique ( rotation shaft , close Gradually , situ bend ) , provide frontal correction 70 % , similar result report technique . The result technique non idiopathic scoliosis still analyze . The creation observatory child 's adolescent scoliosis ( idiopathic , neuromuscular , etc ... ) operate technique reduction simultaneous translation two rod instrumentation : - Firstly , confirm refute first publish result idiopathic scoliosis - And secondly analyze result technique scoliosis . The impact intervention quality life patient essential element evaluate .</detailed_description>
