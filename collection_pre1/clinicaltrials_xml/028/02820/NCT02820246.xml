	<brief_summary>Malnutrition hospital admission risk factor unfavourable outcome , prolong hospital stay delay recovery . In patient incidence complication nosocomial infection , poor ventilatory function , prolong bed rest increase . In addition relevant proportion patient nutritional intake need hospitalisation.Mortality show 8 time higher dependency discharge 3 time frequent actual food intake 25 % calculated need . The aim international cross-sectional multicentre audit registry generate risk level nutritional intervention profile individual unit/ward base case-mix , nutrition care available structure . This profile give snapshot relation risk resource allocation . The audit unit center . Each unit get feedback anonymously position compare participate unit . Risk adjustment select patient group , social environment structure plan . In conclusion audit/registry serve five distinct aim : - Generate precise map prevalence malnutrition admission decrease nutrient intake accord risk factor , medical specialty , organisational structure country . - Increase awareness clinical nutrition patient , caregiver hospital manager . - Enlarge maintain reference database hospitalise patient - Provide individual unit benchmarking</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NutritionDay Worldwide Hospitals : An International Audit Registry Nutrition Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One day international cross-sectional audit type hospital ward . Intensive care unit exclude . Data collect help questionnaire . Anonymised data entry audit database do individual anonymous center unit-codes . The data collect consist four part : 1 . Unit organisation structure : Structural information unit ( one sheet / unit ) fill unit supervise physician together nurse head . 2 . Patient 's demographic &amp; medical information : Demographic profile , diagnostic category base ICD 10 nutritional intervention patient ( one line / patient ) fill responsible person medical staff . Oncological patient additional caregiver sheet define precisely cancer stage specific treatment . 3 . Individual self-administered patient questionnaire : Each patient document her/his nutritional intake study period . In addition patient may ask fill questionnaire change nutritional habit reason decrease nutritional intake patient 's perspective . Oncological patient additional optional patient sheet determine specific nutritional problem supportive treatment use . 4 . Individual patient outcome : hospital cohort : hospital discharge day 30 , whatever come first : date unit discharge , date hospital discharge , site discharge health status . Participation rule : 1 . A user need register nutritionDay member nutritionDay network . Each may choose personal user name . Each user need provide valid email address . After respond validation email user register choose user name . User detail store system connect nutritionDay registry time . One user may serve contact several unit center . 2 . A user may order code participation one several center unit . Access registry possible center code unit code . These code select list random number . Audit/registry recruitment plan : Participation registry voluntary . There actually participation fee . All necessary information obtain dedicate website ( www.nutritionday.org ) . Participation promote via international national scientific society , university , health care organisation governmental agency well via advertisement international national congress . The target would type hospital ward within hospital different size level care . Risk benefit assessment : The benefit patient awareness knowledge nutrition related factor treatment option treat unit increase . There individual risk since audit purely observational . The benefit individual unit receive extensive benchmarking report display unit data comparison unit specialty previous 3 year immediately end data entry validation step . Units group unit may request specific report obtain case case agreement financial coverage . All data use reference benchmarking purpose unit minimum 60 % actually present patient recruit outcome day 30 available 80 % patient . There risk unit since anonymity unit structurally strictly maintain . The benefit registry up-to-date data enable benchmarking pace medical care evolution . Moreover registry data use research scientific community . The aim recruit minimum 10-50 unit 20-30 bed per participate country . A minimum 10 unit per medical specialty necessary allow specialty adjustment . Data security : On datasheets unit hospital/center identify numeric code deliver application nutritionDay coordinate center automatic system . The requirement valid email address direct communication unit . Patients usually identify locally used questionnaire initial age , use initial mandatory . Consecutive numbering also possible . Only participate unit trace patient identifier able collect hospital outcome day 30 nutritionDay answer automatic request data clarification data quality feedback . . During data entry electronic registry anonymous code center , unit patient possible . Thus data handling centre trace data back individual patient . The access data entry protect anonymous center-code unit-code . Typically data collect via dedicate website access via www.nutritionday.org . The protected data server run Center Medical Statistics Informatics Intelligent Systems ( CEMSIS ) Medical University Vienna . The data server mirror back . The data server protect within University Firewall external access . Data feedback individual unit report All participate unit entitle receive bench-marking report registry . The report generator start participate unit , data entry complete . As first step unit receive data feedback sheet base electronic data plausibility miss data analysis . After state data correctly enter final report generate . This final report offer complete descriptive statistic unit data compare reference data previous 4 year correspond specialty . Only data unit fulfil high data quality standard use reference . More 60 % patient present unit need participate 80 % patient need outcome record . Optionally period use comparison extended 2006 . All descriptive statistic represent prevalent data correct cross-sectional sampling allow direct data control interpretation . All download report unit consecutively number stored documentation purpose . Data analysis modelling : The first aim project serve local specialty specific up-to-date benchmarking regard nutrition feed status , risk profile nutrition care . Given typical cross-sectional sample 20-30 patient frequent risk factor easily compare risk factor recent weight loss less normal eat observed one third half patient . The second aim scientific data analysis . The actual research question : - Identifying risk factor associate decreased eating . - Analysing impact risk factor increase length hospital stay - Analysing time-trends risk profile nutrition care - Analysing economic impact nutrition risk factor health care system - Updating PANDORA score major change performance identify The actual database include 103 920 patient period 2006-2012 allow follow precision estimate prevalence risk factor : Risk factor prevalence 1 % precision 95 % CI 0.93-1.07 % Risk factor prevalence 5 % precision 95 % CI 4.87-5.14 % Risk factor prevalence 10 % precision 95 % CI 9.81-10.19 % Risk factor prevalence 20 % precision 95 % CI 19.75-20.25 % Risk factor prevalence 30 % precision 95 % CI 29.72-30.29 % Risk factor prevalence 40 % precision 95 % CI 39.70-40.30 % Given typical participation 12 000-20 000 patient annually , investigator expect sufficiently precise database benchmarking , use last 4 year data . For scientific data analysis investigator use COX-regression general linear model proper weight observation account effect cross-sectional sampling event discharge death linear regression model analyse length stay . Whenever several event occur patient compete risk analysis perform . All data analysis do Dept . Medical Statistics , Medical University Vienna . After publication multinational result , national datasets available national publication base research plan , number ward large enough ensure anonymity individual ward within country .</detailed_description>
