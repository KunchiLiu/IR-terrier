	<brief_summary>The incidence acute kidney injury ( AKI ) among hospitalized patient approximately 7 % . Among patient , sepsis septic shock remain important cause acute renal failure ( ARF ) account 50 % case AKI . The goal project uncover key factor lead renal function recovery . This study plan survey novel biomarkers reflect tissue pathology regeneration . During hospitalization , blood urine sample collect NGAL inflammatory marker analysis patient bacteremia , rest sample collect novel biomarker survey . This study early predict renal function impairment identify possible molecule involve renal function recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recovery renal function acute renal injury important clinical determinant patient morbidity mortality . However , study cover field scarce nonhomogeneous . The `` gold standard '' monitor kidney function measure `` true '' glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 24 h urine isotope collection . Serum creatinine practical surrogate GFR daily care patient . Unfortunately , use serum creatinine limit several patient dependent independent factor . Also , serum creatinine concentration may fall one-third normal advanced CKD secondary extrarenal clearance . The accuracy serum creatinine determine kidney function improve serial measurement serum creatinine , assessment reciprocal slope serum creatinine , serial measurement 24 h creatinine clearance . However , difficult decide residual renal function AKI patient require renal replacement therapy . Furthermore , even change kidney function linear , poor relationship [ Cr ] -1 rate rate function recovery , demonstrate direct comparison urine isotope clearance . Moreover , even 24 h creatinine clearance yield poor estimate renal function recovery . Severe sepsis lead cause acute kidney injury , although little mechanism pathogenesis subset AKI human . Animal model since direct attention lesion , apoptosis , leukocytic infiltration thrombus formation . Kidney biopsy post-mortem patient die septic shock show involvement intense capillary leukocytic infiltration , apoptosis , rare thrombus . Apoptosis leukocytic infiltration , predominantly mononuclear , seem likely major importance . Furthermore , acute tubular lesion correlate arterial lactate concentration . Thus , indicate kidney lesion integral severity multiple organ failure . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , cell wall component gram-negative bacteria , know exert toxic effect activation complement system monocytes-macrophages release secondary mediator like cytokine , chemokines , arachidonic acid derivative , recent report suggest LPS may exert direct toxicity renal cells.LPS potential drug target since presence critical membrane stability , also play prominent role raise immune response . LPS trigger release many inflammatory cytokine , particular , TNFα , interleukin-1β IL-6 , implicate etiological agent variety pathology range mild ( fever ) lethal ( septic shock , organ failure , death ) . Biomarkers biological parameter objectively measure evaluate , act indicator normal pathological process , response intervention . The sensitivity , specificity time course biomarker critical factor determine utility particular biomarker disease process . A surrogate outcome biomarker one faithfully tracts disease include early prediction renal function impairment , response therapy , renal function recovery .</detailed_description>
