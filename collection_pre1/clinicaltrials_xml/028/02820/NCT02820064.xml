	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) characterize chronic systemic hypoxia low-grade inflammation well alteration arginine ( ARG ) metabolism . As ARG synthetized circulate citrulline ( CIT ) , alteration CIT homeostasis , particularly production ornithine transcarbamylase ( OCT ) small intestine could involve . We hypothesize hypoxia +/- inflammation , classically associate COPD , effect OCT regulation enterocytes . This study aim explore effect hypoxia inflammation production citrulline ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC ) activity enterocytes explant culture duodenal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Hypoxia Inflammation Citrulline Synthesis Ornithine Transcarbamylase Human Enterocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Citrulline amino-acid almost exclusively release small intestine synthesis glutamine OTC enterocytes . Citrulline small intestine release portal vena , enter hepatocytes , reach systemic circulation metabolize arginine kidney . By way , important source endogenous ARG . Moreover , evidence suggest circulate citrulline could direct action regulation muscle protein synthesis . Therefore , administration citrulline might interest nutritional strategy preserve restore muscle mass function . Muscle mass determinant respiratory function muscle weakness explain large part morbidity mortality patient suffer Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Evidence suggest citrulline plasmatic level would lower several state involve systemic inflammation hypoxia . Indeed , observe rat hypoxia lead sharp decline plasma CIT concentration also human ( hypocitrullinemia observe Intensive Care Unit patient subject suffer sepsis trauma ) cause relationship yet establish . Therefore , may suppose decreased plasma CIT level could responsible decrease de novo ARG synthesis lead impairment NO production ( endothelial dysfunction ) pathological situation . Because chronic hypoxia systemic inflammation systemic trait patient suffer COPD , fact hypoxia and/or systemic inflammation might directly affect OCT , decrease intestinal citrulline production , turn , could contribute endothelial dysfunction muscle weakness consider . In order explore hypothesis , potential consequence hypoxia inflammation ( alone association ) citrulline synthesis OCT human enterocytes determine , thanks `` explant '' culture model duodenal tissue . Duodenal biopsy remove oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopies perform Hepato-gastro-enterology unit Grenoble University Hospital , among patient expect undergo gastroscopy diagnostic purpose . 30 patient select period 6 month . After complete information write agreement , 8 biopsy specimen remove duodenum patient process organ culture . Then , duodenal biopsy incubate presence cytokine expose hypoxia . Indeed , 4 group constitute : control group ( stimulus ) , group expose hypoxic condition , group expose inflammatory condition ( cytokine ) group expose hypoxic inflammatory condition . As primary endpoint , group , OTC activity citrulline production culture medium study .</detailed_description>
