	<brief_title>Reducing Acute Coronary Syndrome Patient Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient delay mean many people achieve optimal benefit time-dependent treatment Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) . Reducing delay would reduce mortality morbidity date , intervention change behaviour mixed result . Systematic inclusion behaviour-change technique ( BCTs ) visual mode delivery might improve efficacy intervention . Aim To evaluate efficacy BCT-based intervention compare two possible mode delivery ( text+visual text-only ) . Design A 3-arm web-based , parallel randomise , control trial theory-based intervention . Methods analysis The intervention comprise 12 BCTs systematically identify follow systematic review consensus exercise undertaken behaviour change expert . We aim recruit n=177 participant experience ACS previous 6 month local National Health Service ( NHS ) Teaching Hospital . Participants identify Cardiac Rehabilitation staff invite letter take part study . Those wish take part ask access experiment secure web-address consent re-checked . Consenting participant randomly allocate equal number one three study group : ) usual care ii ) usual care plus text-only BCT-based intervention iii ) usual care plus text+visual BCT-based intervention . The outcome variable change intention phone ambulance immediately symptoms ACS ≥15 minute duration assess use two randomised series 8 scenario represent vary symptom delivery intervention control condition ( usual care ) .</detailed_description>
