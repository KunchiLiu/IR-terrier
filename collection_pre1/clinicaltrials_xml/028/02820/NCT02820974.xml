	<brief_summary>There lack effective early screen system migraine-susceptible woman peri-menopause period . The process acute pain cognition well underling functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) feature suitable screen pain-susceptible individual . However , study issue among large sample peri-menopause woman . The investigator thus design current trial investigate processing acute pain cognition well underling feature functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .The investigator combine pain behavior , cognitive task , fMRI analysis , psychophysiological interaction ( PPI ) suitable statistical package investigate relationship mention feature occurrence migraine test efficacy feature predict migraine development .

	<brief_title>The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study Processing Acute Pain Cognition Among Perimenopause Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although prevalence migraine high peri-menopause period , exist significant individual difference whether develop migraine among population . However , still lack effective early screen system migraine- susceptible woman peri-menopause period . Individual acute pain processing interaction cognition well underling feature functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) suitable screen pain-susceptible individual . Actually , feature acute pain processing interaction cognition well fMRI alteration report two previous small sample trial among pre-menopause population , however , similar study large sample peri-menopause woman . The investigator previously report abnormal acute pain processing decrease cognition experimental peri-menopause rat well peri-menopause woman migraine . The investigator thus raise current hypothesis acute pain processing interaction cognition well underling feature functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) usable screen migraine-susceptible individual among peri-menopause woman . In current project , The investigator combine pain behavior , cognitive task , fMRI analysis , psychophysiological interaction ( PPI ) suitable statistical package investigate relationship mention feature occurrence migraine test efficacy feature predict migraine development . The investigator try establish screen system migraine-susceptible individual peri-menopause woman .</detailed_description>
