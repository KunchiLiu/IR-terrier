	<brief_title>Influence Couch Tracking Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy one main option cancer treatment , alongside surgery chemotherapy . Its efficacy largely depend absorbed radiation dose tumor cell . However , irradiation healthy cell result negative side effect patient . Therefore , big challenge radiation therapy irradiate tumor sufficient dose , keep irradiation healthy tissue reasonably low . Currently , radiation treatment plan define volume enclose tumor , add margin account uncertainty . These margin ensure tumor receives prescribe dose . Tumor motion contribute uncertainty . The tumor motion tumor different site different cause , project focus thoracic , liver , adrenal gland tumor . The motion tumor type mainly cause patient 's respiration . So , tumor motion pattern depend respiration pattern patient . The motion lung tumor report peak-to-peak amplitude 24 mm . Currently , tumor motion handle enlarge margin , tumor always inside defined volume . But enlarge margin also result increase irradiated volume consist healthy tissue . Tumor motion mitigation concern reduce margin increase cause motion tumor . There several approach tumor motion mitigation one consideration project tumor track approach , technically difficult approach . In tumor track tumor motion continuously compensate move radiation source modify radiation beam , move patient , denote couch tracking . In couch tracking , patient move robotic treatment couch . Such robotic treatment couch use conventional , widely available C-arm linear accelerator , , therefore , readily available implement couch tracking . The patient place couch move opposite direction tumor motion . The goal minimize patient 's tumor motion relative radiation , turn allow margin decrease . The margin decrease might ultimately lead reduction side effect , e.g . pneumonitis . The motion couch depend motion tumor , turn depend respiration patient . However , couch motion may influence patient 's well patient 's respiration . So question arises : Does motion couch influence respiration behavior ? And also : Does motion couch influence well ( motion sickness ) ? And well-being respiration behavior connect ? If respiration behavior depend couch motion , may necessary control respiration behavior . Additionally , study , investigator check assumption couch tracking , namely patient 's body rigidly fix couch . If assumption hold , motion patient 's body relative couch take account couch tracking .</detailed_description>
