	<brief_summary>GSK1358820 botulinum neurotoxin A complex approve treatment overactive bladder ( OAB ) several country , however , approve OAB treatment Japan . This study plan evaluate efficacy safety GSK1358820 Japanese OAB patient urinary incontinence whose symptom adequately manage medication OAB . The primary objective study evaluate superiority single dose treatment GSK1358820 100 unit ( U ) compare placebo . The study comprise screen phase 28 day , follow double-blind treatment phase 12 48 week wherein subject receive single treatment either GSK1358820 100 U injection Placebo injection , ratio 1:1 , stratification within treatment arm accord number urinary urge incontinence episode screen . Subjects meet criterion re-treatment receive second third treatment . Each re-treatment open-label GSK1358820 100 U injection , space least 12 week previous treatment . The total duration participation subject exceed 52 week , include screen 48-week treatment period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged &gt; =20 year time signing informed consent . Subject symptom OAB ( frequency urgency ) urinary incontinence period least 6 month immediately prior screening , determine document subject history . Subject adequately manage one medication ( , anticholinergic beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist ) treatment OAB symptom . 'Not adequately manage ' define : An inadequate response least 4week period OAB medication ( ) approve optimize dose ( ) , , subject still incontinent despite medication ( ) OAB ; limit side effect ( , condition subject reduce dosage discontinue medication due side effect least 2week period OAB medication ( ) approve optimize dose ( ) ) . Subject experience follow , 3day subject bladder diary complete screening phase : 1 . &gt; = 3 episode urinary urgency incontinence , one urgency incontinencefree day 2. urinary frequency ( defined average &gt; = 8 micturition [ toilet void ] per day , , total &gt; = 24 micturition ) Subject willing use clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) drain urine determine necessary investigator ( subinvestigator ) . Body weight &gt; =40 kilogram ( kg ) screening . Males female : 1 . Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication study exit : Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . Male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option : Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet standard operate procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . 2 . Female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : • Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . • Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication study exit . This list highly effective method ( approve Japan ) provide , apply FRP sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis : Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ; Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Subject give sign informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol ( example , use toilet without assistance , complete bladder diary questionnaires , able collect volume void per micturition measurement 24hour period , attend study visit opinion investigator ( subinvestigator ) . Subject symptom OAB due know neurological reason ( example , spinal cord injury , multiple sclerosis , cerebrovascular accident , Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , etc . ) Subject predominance stress incontinence determine subject history . Subject history evidence disease , functional abnormality bladder surgery , OAB , may affect bladder function include limited : 1 . Bladder stone ( include bladder stone surgery ) within 6 month prior screen confirm occurrence bladder stone screen phase 2 .

Use external device prohibit within 7 day prior start screen phase 4 . History interstitial cystitis , opinion investigator ( subinvestigator ) 5 . Past current evidence hematuria due urological/renal pathology uninvestigated hematuria . Subjects investigate hematuria may enter study urological/renal pathology rule satisfaction investigator ( subinvestigator ) . 6 .

Notes : 1 . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , and/or another method , machineread manually overread 2 . The specific formula use determine eligibility discontinuation individual subject determine prior initiation study . In word , several different formula use calculate QTc individual subject low QTc value use include discontinue subject trial Subject hemophilia clot factor deficiency disorder cause bleed diathesis . Subject receive anticholinergic , beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist medication therapy treat symptom OAB , include nocturia , within 7 day prior start screen phase . Subject treat intravesical pharmacologic agent ( example , capsaicin , resiniferatoxin ) OAB symptom within 12 month prior initiation Treatment phase 1 ( Week 0 ) .
