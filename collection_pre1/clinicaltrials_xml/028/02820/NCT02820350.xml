	<brief_summary>The SCD ( Selective Cytopheretic Device ) extracorporeal device use adjunct renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) improve outcome pediatric patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Funding Source - FDA OOPD ( SCD-PED-01 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Efficacy Selective Cytopheretic Device ( SCD ) Pediatric Patients With Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selective cytopheretic device ( SCD ) comprise tubing , connector hemofilter cartridge . The device connect series commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ( CRRT ) device . Blood CRRT circuit divert CRRT hemofilter extra capillary space ( ECS ) SCD . Blood circulate space return patient via venous return line CRRT circuit . Regional citrate anticoagulation use entire CRRT SCD blood circuit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A patient , legal representative , sign write informed consent form . 2 . Must receive medical care intensive care unit ( e.g. , ICU , MICU , SICU , CTICU , Trauma ) . 3 . Age le 22 year . 4 . Females child bear potential pregnant ( confirm negative serum pregnancy test ) lactate recently postpartum . 5 . Intent deliver full supportive care aggressive management utilize available therapy minimum 96 hour . 6 . Clinical diagnosis AKI due hemodynamic toxic etiology require CRRT ( see Appendix B ) . AKI define acute kidney injury occur set acute ischemic nephrotoxic injury one following : Increase SCr ≥0.3 mg/dL ( ≥26.5 μmol/L ) within 48 hour ; Increase SCr ≥1.5 time baseline , know presumed occur within prior 7 day ; Urine volume &lt; 0.5ml/kg/h 6 hour 7 . All patient must able tolerate regional citrate anticoagulation . Tolerance regional citrate anticoagulation define meeting follow criterion : 1 . Two ( 2 ) hr treatment citrate anticoagulation without side effect citrate therapy . 2 . Two ( 2 ) consecutive intracircuit iCa level &lt; 0.40 mmol/L , least 30 minute apart within first 4 hour citrate therapy . 8 . At least one nonrenal organ failure presence ( proven suspect ) sepsis 1 . Threshold blood pressure 80/40 mmHg patient systolic blood pressure le 80 mmHg diastolic blood pressure le 40 mmHg . 2 . Irreversible brain damage base available historical clinical information . 3 . Presence organ transplant time . 4 . Acute chronic use circulatory support device LVADs , RVADs , BIVADs , ECMO . 5 . Presence preexist advanced chronic renal failure ( i.e. , ESRD ) require chronic renal replacement therapy prior episode acute kidney injury . 6 . AKI occur set burn , obstructive uropathy , allergic interstitial nephritis , acute rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , shigatoxin associate hemolyticuremic syndrome , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) , malignant hypertension , scleroderma renal crisis , atheroembolism , functional surgical nephrectomy , hepatorenal syndrome , cyclosporine , tacrolimus nephrotoxicity . 7 . Received &gt; 12 hour CRRT hospital admission prior transfer outside hospital . 8 . Received &gt; 1 hemodialysis treatment hospital admission prior transfer outside hospital . 9 . Hospitalization &gt; 14 day hospital admission prior transfer outside hospital . 10 . Metastatic malignancy actively treat may treat chemotherapy radiation subsequent three month period study therapy . 11 . Chronic immunosuppression . 12 . HIV AIDS . 13 . Severe liver failure . 14 . Current Do Not Attempt Resuscitation ( DNAR ) , Allow Natural Death ( AND ) , withdrawal care status , anticipate change status within next 7 day . 15 . Patient expect survive 28 day irreversible medical condition . ( This restrictive AKI , may include situation presence irreversible brain damage , untreatable malignancy , inoperable life threaten condition , condition therapy regard futile PI . ) 16 . Any medical condition Investigator think may interfere study objective . 17 . Physician refusal . 18 . Dry weight &lt; 20 kg . 19 . Platelet count &lt; 30,000/mm3 time screen . 20 . Concurrent enrollment another interventional clinical trial . Patients enrol clinical trial measurement and/or sample take ( NO TEST DEVICE OR TEST DRUG USED ) allow participate . 21 . Use Investigational drug device within previous 30 day .</criteria>
