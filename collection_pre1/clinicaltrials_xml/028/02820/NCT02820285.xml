	<brief_summary>Recent epidemiological study France show high prevalence obesity ( 14.5 % ) strong increase last 20 year . Among many complication associate obesity , liver complication ( steatosis steatohepatitis [ NASH ] ) among common . Semaphorins describe early 1990 . More 20 type protein report date . These protein use neural development . Since many function also describe . The semaphorins involve numerous physiological physiopathological process ( cardiac morphogenesis , vascular growth , tumor progression ) , regulation immune cell liver fibrosis . Preliminary study allow show dendritic cell infiltrate adipose tissue initiate activation T cell inflammation . Immune semaphorin new player regulation inflammation immune reaction . The role immune semaphorin regulate inflammation two compartment ( liver adipose tissue ) could crucial step could lead severe liver damage . Its dysregulation could explain NASH injury . The goal identify new mode regulation cellular homeostasis fatty liver disease . These factor may serve diagnostic marker future therapeutic target .</brief_summary>
