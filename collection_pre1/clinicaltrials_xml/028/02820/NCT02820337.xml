	<brief_summary>The main goal project study subcutaneous visceral ( SAT VAT ) adipose tissue take bariatric surgery ( Single port sleeve gastrectomy ) subject HIV infection , anf morbid obesity undetectable viral load ( VL ) HIV lipohypertrophy particularly truncal . The study cover morphology adipocytes , fibrosis , immune activation inflammation , gene expression , pharmacology antiretroviral drug ( ARV ) measurement viral replication adipose tissue plasma bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The choice sleeve gastrectomy base choose effective technique complication , rupture digestive continuity therefore little malabsorptive effect well quality life . The intervention sleeve gastrectomy offer unique opportunity study SAT VAT HIV obese patient bariatric surgery , analyze specific modification tissue good understand pathophysiology disease . The term associate change cardiometabolic comorbidities improvement weight loss important element management patient . It therefore important evaluate whether fibrosis term change observe HIV patient change effectiveness intervention . In general population , obesity major public health problem . It consider inflammatory disease , multifactorial chronic evolution , require long-term medical care / surgery . Indeed , body mass index ( BMI ) correlate increased mortality mainly due cardiovascular disease ( hypertension , coronary artery disease ) , cancer diabetes . Finally , overweight obesity lead cause liver disease Western country result nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , term include hepatic lesion observe overweight obesity : steatosis , steatohepatitis , fibrosis , cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease reflect presence insulin resistance also participate installation . Reducing overweight therefore key part treatment reduce chronic inflammation , insulin resistance liver damage . There little data literature prevalence obesity population HIV patient . In France , prevalence obesity French Hospital Database HIV 15.1 % among woman 5.3 % among men , similar prevalence general population . Patients born sub-Saharan Africa high risk 20.7 % versus 12.2 % woman 10.9 % versus 4.7 % men . No data available obesity complication describe general population population obese HIV patient . Nevertheless , apart obesity , patient infect HIV develop cardiovascular metabolic complication well document recent year . French international recommendation agree management obesity multidisciplinary . In treatment , surgical treatment treatment choice French international recommendation follow indication : - morbid obesity ( BMI ≥ 40 kg / M² ) resistant medical treatment expose patient serious complication control specific treatment - obesity BMI 35 40 kg / M² comorbidities associate life-threatening functional outcome : cardiovascular disease , musculoskeletal disease , severe metabolic disorder control maximal medical therapy . In case , indication consider patient access specialize medical care least 6 month , also include complementary approach ( diet , physical activity , management psychological problem , treatment complication ) . At present , sleeve gastrectomy technique choice general population , compare bariatric surgery technique bypass , reduce complication , length hospital stay , operative time , gain term quality life without disruption digestive continuity therefore little malabsorption . This lack malabsorption argument choice HIV patient cART reduce risk malabsorption ARV vitamin deficiency vitamin D deficiency already well describe HIV . The minimally invasive approach ( 1 trocar ) , routinely perform Dr. G. Pourcher obese patient whether infected HIV , reduce surgical risk . This Single port also allow easy access SAT , VAT liver . The management obesity HIV population , similar life expectancy general population remain day marginal . The literature subject almost `` poor '' Additionally , comorbid condition exist population HIV patient target population require support least equivalent general population .</detailed_description>
