	<detailed_description>Introduction : The percentage elderly general population increase rapidly . Currently , Dutch population comprise one fifth person age 65 year old recent estimate show increase roughly quarter next 20 year . Since th incidence peripheral arterial disease increase age , rise elderly also reflect population patient refer vascular surgery . Elderly patient high risk postoperative complication , mortality functional decline young patient . In frail elderly effect might pronounce . Frailty umbrella term encompass patient related factor weight loss , muscle wasting , inactivity , comorbidities polypharmacy . Current score system use predict postoperative mortality complication follow vascular surgery perform poorly elderly population take account frailty . Moreover design predict mortality complication validate predict patient report outcome measure quality life functional status . The aim AGE VASC study ass value frailty factor predict improvement quality life one year peripheral vascular surgery . Methods : The AGE VASC study prospective observational cohort study . All patient age 70 year old , schedule peripheral vascular surgery low limb , mentally competent sign informed consent eligible study . Before surgery patient screen frailty use different questionnaire physical test . The battery test exist Short Form 36 ( SF36 ) , Walking Impairment Questionnaire ( WIQ ) , Multi Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , Nagi 's scale disability , Geriatric Depression Scale -8 ( GDS8 ) , three physical test : five meter walk speed , time get go test hand grip strength . And non-invasive measurement Advanced Glycation Endproducts ( AGEs ) . A blood sample take determine vitamin status , immune status iron deficiency . After surgery , electronic patient chart study score postoperative complication mortality . Three twelve month surgery patient receive SF-36 , WIQ , World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule ( WHODAS ) 2.0 questionnaire determine quality life functional status .</detailed_description>
