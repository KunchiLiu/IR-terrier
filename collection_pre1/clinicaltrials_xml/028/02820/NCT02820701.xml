	<brief_title>Ultrasound Evaluation OMT Sacral Base Asymmetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose prospective , randomize , control trial investigate effect osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) sacral base asymmetry assess ultrasound . The study conduct July 2016 - June 2017 data collection plan August September 2016 . Forty men woman age 20 55 year least one episode LBP past two week recruit Kirksville area . Participants randomly assign two group , control OMT use random number generator . Males female randomize separately ensure equal distribution two study group . Demographics include sex , age , body mass index ( BMI ) collect participant . All participant complete brief medical history questionnaire , receive initial palpatory assessment sacral base asymmetry , initial ultrasound evaluation sacral base asymmetry . After ultrasound assessment , control group wait another room approximately 30 minute . Participants OMT group receive OMT address sacral base asymmetry initial ultrasound assessment . Following treatment period OMT group , participant receive second ultrasound assessment sacral base asymmetry . The ultrasonographer blind whether subject receive OMT . After second ultrasound measurement , participant control group offer OMT treatment consistent OMT group .</detailed_description>
