	<brief_summary>Preterm birth alters normal sequence lung development last respiratory consequence . It still unclear whether observed respiratory morbidity preterm born individual reflect sequelae non-progressive lung disease occur early life result ongoing active disease , leave undiagnosed untreated , could increase risk COPD-like phenotype . We propose examine micro-structural abnormality lung use innovative non-invasive imaging technology relation pulmonary function marker inflammation oxidative stress young adult born preterm .</brief_summary>
