	<detailed_description>Preventable error healthcare lead cause patient injury death . Despite extensive effort expenditure billion dollar , computerization fail solve problem . Research show software design debug paper prescription markedly decrease rate injury death associate use opioids hospitalize patient . To application insight software engineering practice medicine , PIs design build Patient-Oriented Prescription Programming Language ( POP-PL ) evaluate new platform use improve medical management patient . The design POP-PL base building understand process medical treatment patient . This project collaboration computer scientist clinicians Northwestern Medicine . The collaborate clinician co-investigators research project also provide healthcare patient observe . The computer scientist research staff undergone human subject research train co-investigators research project well . The clinician-investigators oversee research project staff observation patient , clinical encounter healthcare provider patient , interaction healthcare provider healthcare information system . Researchers involve study observe interaction health care provider patient collate observation data electronic data source . Since research base mainly upon observation chart review involve intervention change patient care , risk study participant minimal , involve inadvertent disclosure healthcare information . This risk mitigate anonymizing collect data .</detailed_description>
