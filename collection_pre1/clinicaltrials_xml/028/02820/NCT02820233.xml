	<detailed_description>The EGF family receptor tyrosine kinase ( a.k.a . ERBB receptor ) mediate effect epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) family include Neuregulin-1Î² ( NRG ) . NRG ERBB1-4 critical cardiac development maintenance adult heart . Current understanding role EGF/NRG/ERBB signal cardiovascular system rapidly evolve due recent finding non-myocyte cell population . This study examine population progenitor cell adult human heart respond EGF NRG . Subjects enrol schedule undergo heart surgery willing allow small biopsy take heart surgery . Biopsies take laboratory cell separate analyzed flow cytometry grow cell culture understand biology regulate NRG EGF .</detailed_description>
