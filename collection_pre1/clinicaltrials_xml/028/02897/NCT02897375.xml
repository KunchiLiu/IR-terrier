	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose palbociclib cisplatin carboplatin treat patient solid tumor spread place usually cure controlled treatment . Palbociclib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving palbociclib cisplatin carboplatin may help stop tumor growth patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palbociclib With Cisplatin Carboplatin Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability palbociclib administer along cisplatin carboplatin . II . Establish recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) test combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile cisplatin , carboplatin . II . Obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor efficacy test combination regimen . III . Conduct PK/pharmacodynamics ( PD ) correlative analysis use palbociclib trough concentration cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( CDK4 ) inhibition read-outs tumor surrogate sample collect course 1 day 22 ( C1D22 ) . IV . Assess potential association tissue-based biomarkers efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 palbociclib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2-22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 palbociclib PO QD day 2-22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
