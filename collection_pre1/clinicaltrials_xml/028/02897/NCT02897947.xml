	<brief_title>Outcome Surgery Lumbar Spinal Stenosis - Comparison Data From Three National Quality Registries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational register base study , i.e . prospective data registration retrospective study design . Eligible patient 50 year older treat surgically LSS Denmark , Norway Sweden 2011 , 2012 , 2013 history previous lumbar spine surgery . Register-based study advantage large sample size great external validity , also limitation low follow-up rate , inferior data quality compare clinical trial . Data present accord STROBE criterion . The register : All registry aim study outcome spine surgery . All department participate voluntarily . Patients participate voluntarily sign inform consent . At time admission , patient report data demographic , social factor , comorbidity previous surgery . After surgery , surgeon record diagnosis type surgery perform . The Norwegian Spine register , NORspine , base experience Swespine register previous validation study local clinical registry , founded 2007 . In total 38 40 center perform lumbar spine surgery Norway report NORspine . Coverage approximately 95 % . The completeness approximately 65 % . The Swespine Register include individual treat surgery lumbar spinal stenosis since 1993 . During last decade , number department participate registry vary 35 41 42 45 department provide spinal surgery service Sweden . Coverage approximately 90 % . The completeness ( number patient report Swespine time surgery ) approximately 80 % . The Danish spine register , DaneSpine , base Swespine acquire Danish Spine Society Swedish Society Spinal Surgeons 2009 successively implement . Coverage completeness DaneSpine determine . Quality assurance : Loss follow-up may bias result . Solberg et al . ( 2011 ) study 633 patient , operate degenerative disorder lumbar spine Norway , find loss follow-up 22 % would bias conclusion overall treatment effect . There indication bad outcomes non-responders group . In similar one-center study DaneSpine . HÃ¸jmark et al . ( 2016 ) find loss follow-up 12 % seem bias conclusion draw DaneSpine center . Data handle Anonymized individual level data three register pool one database . The cohort divide country comparison . Missing data range data : In case miss data case exclusion analysis analysis , use . Out range data delete . Analysis The data clean exclude patient miss incorrect date surgery , miss date follow-up , previous lumbar spine surgery surgery decompression lumbar spinal stenosis without concomitant arthrodesis . After data cleaning , aim perform blind statistical analysis , independent statistician performing analysis unaware group belonging ( i.e . country ) . The code broken analysis interpretation perform . Comparisons indication surgery Analysis baseline data include age surgery , sex , anthropometrics , number smoker , Oswestry Disability Index , EQ-5D , number sick leave , employment status , duration leg back pain present mean ( SD ) , mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) , number ( % ) . Variables analyze analysis variance , Chi-square logistic regression test . Data present crude ( unadjusted ) data elucidate difference country . Comparisons outcome Comparisons change outcome variable baseline 1 year , well comparison actual value 1 year perform . Analysis covariance , Chi-square logistic regression test crude ( unadjusted ) data present . In addition , baseline variable use covariates analysis covariance adjust data present . Propensity score also consider covariates . Comparison surgical method use Based decompression without concomitant arthrodesis . Non-response analysis A non-response analysis perform compare available baseline variable respond 1 year follow-up respond . Sample size A study similar character never perform . Due nature study , sample size formulate guise power , risk level , clinical difference . The number patient participate study estimate 7500 . The sample large difference Oswestry Disability Index low 2 point may detect ( power 90 % , significance level 5 % ) , interpretation minimal important difference 10-15 point Oswestry Disability Index often refer take account .</detailed_description>
