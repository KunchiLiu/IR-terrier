	<brief_summary>Abnormal respiratory sound ( wheeze and/or crackle ) diagnosis criterion acute bronchiolitis . One third infant develop recurrent episode , lead diagnosis infant asthma . Nowadays , available treatment shortens course bronchiolitis hasten resolution symptom , thus , therapy supportive . Our hypothesis diagnosis wheeze bronchiolitis ( ~60 % infant ) help select infant benefit anti-asthma therapy . In set diagnosis wheeze crucial , objective tool recognition wheeze clinical value . The investigator develop wheeze recognition algorithm record respiratory sound Smartphone place near mouth ( Bokov P , Comput Biol Med , 2016 ) . The objective present cross sectional , observational study 1/ validate approach large sample infant ( 1 24 month ) admit hospital respiratory complaint period viral bronchiolitis , 2/ use gold standard diagnosis wheeze respiratory sound recording ( Littmann ) subsequent analysis two experienced pediatrician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infants ( 1 24 month old ) recruit two emergency department ( Robert Debré ; Antoine Béclère hospital Assistance publique - Hôpitaux de Paris ) base respiratory complaint . Six characteristic record ( age , sex , SpO2 , presence absence wheezing , respiratory sound , initial diagnosis ) . Two recording respiratory sound obtain almost simultaneously : one Smartphone mouth ( 5 cm ) one electronic stetoscope ( Littmann ) . Two expert pediatrician listen recording give thee group : wheezing ( agreement ) , without wheeze ( agreement ) non agreement diagnosis . The recording make Smartphone subject wheeze recognition algorithm previously describe . The sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPP evaluate . The algorithm improve necessary use true negative true positive recording ( expert agreement ) .</detailed_description>
