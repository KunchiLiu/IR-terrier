	<detailed_description>Cork University Hospital designate cancer centre , national Cancer Control Programme treat excess 560 new case breast cancer year . Breast surgery perform five specialist breast surgeon , patient access service either National Cancer Screening Programme ( BreastCheck ) via referral family physician rapid access symptomatic breast assessment unit . Both acute persistent pain follow incisional breast surgery significant problem . In past , report 50 % woman undergo incisional breast surgery experience significant pain immediately follow surgery . One three woman may develop persistent post surgical pain last great 3 month . The use multimodal analgesic regimen include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory , paracetamol , low dose opiate importantly local anaesthetic technique see significant improvement post-operative pain management follow incisional breast surgery . Local anaesthetic technique paravertebral blockade become commonplace management pain follow major incisional breast surgery . Current budgetary difficulty bring increased pressure bear upon use availability hospital bed . This result shift inpatient model care day case model . More 85 % breast cancer surgery perform day case ( day admission/discharge ) . The remainder breast cancer surgery require day admission variable length stay post-operatively . Pain significant determinant length post operative stay . Patients moderate severe pain less independent , require assistance basic care , consume opiate analgesic , suffer opiate-related side effect , less compliant post-operative physiotherapy consume healthcare resource patient mild pain . Therefore design implementation effective pain management strategy woman undergo major incisional breast surgery essential component overall perioperative patient care pathway . Since 2010 , patient undergo major incisional breast surgery BreastCheck Cork University Hospital receive multimodal analgesic regimen follow surgery base upon use local anaesthetic continuous wound infiltration ( CWI ) . The efficacy CWI follow mastectomy find equivalent gold standard paravertebral block . Similarly , efficacy CWI woman undergo axillary lymph node dissection previously demonstrate . The clinical experience woman undergo mastectomy axillary clearance sentinel node surgery suggest equivalence paravertebral analgesia CWI . Since January 2013 , woman undergo major breast cancer surgery Cork University Hospital enrol prospective cohort study evaluate efficacy enhance perioperative pathway . Elements pathway include improved process flow establishment dedicate preoperative assessment preadmission clinic , day surgery hospital admission admission lounge adjacent operating theatre , standardise anaesthesia , analgesia surgical protocol , goal base immediate post-operative recovery , early independent ambulation enteral nutrition , active discharge plan early assessment hospital discharge readiness . Although woman follow major breast cancer surgery achieve hospital discharge readiness score early , length hospital stay determine institutional individual clinician convention , rather objective assessment home readiness . Parallel work enhance perioperative pathway , clinician Cork University Hospital devise APP base technology integrate perioperative pathway . Prior surgery , APPs provide clinician user generate educational material relate first person perspective perioperative experience . In post-operative phase , technology enable clinician monitor interact patient remotely , thereby facilitate early hospital discharge . The technology also enable patient communicate anonymously , generate contemporaneous community recovery . The objective work threefold : identify , characterise manage barrier safe discharge within 23 hour major breast cancer surgery ; evaluate feasibility discharge select cohort patient 23 hour follow major breast cancer surgery indwell CWI mainstay post operative analgesia evaluate analgesic efficacy CWI woman discharge within 23 hour major breast cancer surgery Primary Endpoint : The analgesic efficacy safety CWI woman discharge home within 23 hour major breast cancer surgery assess patient report pain score 24 48 hour discharge , surveillance detect adverse event associate CWI use . Secondary Endpoints : Quality recovery 24 &amp; 48 hour ( QoR 40 ) Analgesic Consumption 24 &amp; 48 hour Wound drain output 24 &amp; 48 hour Patient Satisfaction Score Preoperatively , patient screen preassessment clinic suitability 23 hour discharge assess accord institutional norm . The patient receive preoperative , nurse deliver education regard wound care wound drain management . A mutually agree discharge plan design patient multidisciplinary team . The patient receive perioperative technology device become familiar educational communication functionality contain within . On day surgery patient admit operate theatre day surgery area ( DOSA ) . In DOSA opportunity meet perioperative team ask outstanding question . They change theatre gown enter operate theatre . This patient cohort receive standard propofol TIVA ( T4 TIVA protocol attach ) . With standard monitoring place ( pulse oximetry , electrocardiography , non-invasive arterial blood pressure inspire end- tidal partial pressure O2 CO2 ) , patient receive preinduction Fentanyl 100mcg Midazolam 2mg . Entropy process frontal lobe EEG monitoring attach . Anaesthesia induce propofol target control infusion ( Marsh Algorithm ; 4-6mcg/ml dose range use 2 % Propofol ) lung assist ventilate 65 % oxygen/air mixture . Airway intraoperative fluid management entirely discretion responsible consultant anaesthetist . Intraoperative analgesia : Patients receive Diclofenac 75mg Paracetamol 1g surgery . Administration intraoperative morphine 0.1mg/kg discretion consultant anaesthetist . All patient give PONV prophylaxis ondansetron 4mg dexamethasone 8mg intraoperatively . Wound soakage 40ml 0.25 % bupivacaine 1:200,000 adrenaline perform surgeon , allow minimum 3 minute soakage time prior wound closure . Two multiple port catheter place surgeon , one direct towards chest wound towards axillary wound . These catheter connect prefilled INFUSOR single use pump deliver 5 ml/hr 0.25 % bupivacaine . Postoperatively , patient transfer theatre post anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) remain PACU discharge criterion meet . In PACU , patient experience pain , 10 ml 2 % Lidocaine administer catheter CWI first instance . Morphine 2mg IV PRN may administer rescue analgesia require thereafter . Patients may administer additional antiemetic ( Ondansetron ) PACU . Following transfer ward , patient receive standard analgesic regimen Diclofenac sodium , 75 mg PO 12 hourly/ PRN Paracetamol , 1 g PO/PR , 6 hourly /PRN , Oxycodone ( Oxynorm ) 10mg 4 hourly /PRN . While hospital , data relation patient recovery , pain complication record use Cork University Hospital 's perioperative pathway clinical data sheet . Following discharge , postoperative data collect use bespoke android app specifically design capture outcome measure first second post operative day . The app gather anonymised data relation pain ( slide-rule page analogous visual analogue score ) , quality recovery ( QoR40 Score ) , wind drain output millilitre patient satisfaction likert-type scale . Data collect follow discharge first second postoperative day . Participants encourage provide free-text feedback relation healthcare experience . Any adverse event monitor , record treat appropriately . Summary data respect primary secondary endpoint present . Where appropriate , 95 % confidence interval calculate .</detailed_description>
