	<brief_summary>Main idea perception write story picture among impaired right hemisphere patient Abstract The right hemisphere consider complement language processing ability opposite hemisphere ; responsible processing secondary unusual characteristic linguistic stimulates . This processing enable , among function , comprehension metaphor humor . Additionally , enable execution infer spoken write discourse . Studies deal common impairment among right-hemisphere-damaged ( RHD ) individual , find inference processing write story narrative sequence present picture impair . This impairment could damage ability create global coherence , important component central theme comprehension different type narrative . Another important component superstructure , schema aid create , remember produce main idea speak write discourse . Other study consider impairment create global coherence , Theory Mind impairment , source central theme comprehension impairment among RHD individual . Discourse integral part interpersonal communication , proper social conduct . The theme choose conversation reflect functional role discourse semantic pragmatic point view . The aim current study deepen current knowledge concern central theme comprehension among RHD individual follow cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , two genre write discourse ( classic story story twist ) , situation represent single picture . Unlike write story , extraction central theme single picture require focus single situation rely non-linguistic visual information . Differences concern central theme comprehension different discourse genre picture might able assist select diagnostic therapeutic tool design work high cognitive-linguistic ability , usually impair among RHD individual . In late stage , tool meant help improve RHD individual ' spontaneous narrative skill . The study include 20 RHD adult follow CVA , 20 healthy adult without know damage right hemisphere . The two group match concern sex , age , educational level socio-economic status . The subject perform study test three session , 60 minute . The screening test include language diagnosis - Western Aphasia Battery ( WAB ) , read test . 37 include Psycholinguistic Assessments Language Processing Aphasia 's battery ( PALPA ) . Patients diagnose aphasia exclude research . The research test include : central theme comprehension test story picture , include classic story , story twist , picture different situation ( accompany multiple-choice question concern central theme ) , sub- exanimations take `` Frigbi '' battery design evaluate memory phonological memory capacity , Raven 's Progressive Colored Matrices test design evaluate pre-morbid ability ( non-linguistic ) , Theory Mind ( T.O.M ) evaluation test , test design evaluate central coherence impairment : Navon Figures test evaluation global visual perception impairment , Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test ( RCFT ) - Recall Form test evaluation visual-perceptive organizational ability , non-verbal memory . The performance two group compare test use statistical test . In addition , interaction variable measure .</brief_summary>
