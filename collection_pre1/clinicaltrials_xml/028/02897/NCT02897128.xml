	<brief_summary>Wound complication sarcoma resection frequent potentially devastate problem . The burden surgical wound complication low extremity preoperative external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) soft tissue sarcoma estimate 43 % . A noninvasive method predict complication would extremely beneficial . The aim study evaluate relationship preoperative skin oxygenation wound outcome multi-center prospective analysis . This information could lead change practice regard surgical timing adjunctive intervention improve wound heal outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Oxygen Predictor Wound Healing Complications Preoperatively Radiated Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 11,400 new case soft tissue sarcoma diagnose United States annually . Most high-grade sarcoma , select low intermediate grade sarcoma , treat limb salvage surgical resection conjunction external beam radiation optimize local control . The current preference practice orthopaedic/surgical oncologist radiation oncologists implement radiation treatment prior surgery diminish total radiation dose field size , thereby optimize long-term functional result salvage limb . While clear advantage preoperative radiation , well-demonstrated negative consequence regard heal surgical wound . Currently reliable clinical criterion aid physician determine individual patient 's risk develop postoperative wound complication . This fact , combine rarity sarcoma diagnosis , prevent improvement wound outcomes sarcoma patient . This project design close critical gap knowledge . The investigator propose utilize preoperative measurement transcutaneous oxygen ( Tc02 ) propose incision classify patient high- low-risk category development wound complication resection . Measurement preoperative TcO2 represent novel application simple , noninvasive method ass skin oxygenation . Given result already complete pilot investigation ( Nystrom 2016 ) , investigator believe important clinical problem well suit prospective , multi-disciplinary , multi-institutional investigation . A successful project would result enhanced ability identify wound risk prior surgery allow additional investigation perioperative intervention ( delay surgery recovery oxygenation , increase suture duration , judicious use muscle flap skin graft , postoperative hyperbaric oxygen , treatment incisional wound vacuum-assisted closure ) may mitigate significant adverse outcome .</detailed_description>
