	<brief_summary>Open-label study evaluate safety efficacy Ixazomib combination Lenalidomide Dexamethasone patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The patient population consist adult men woman 65 year , confirm diagnosis MM meet eligibility criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Induction Extended Consolidation Plus Lenalidomide Maintenance Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive induction therapy , comprise three cycle Ixazomib , plus Lenalidomide Dexamethasone . Peripheral Blood Stem Cells ( PBSC ) mobilize within 2 week ( +/- 1 week ) last dose Lenalidomide , Cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF Granulocyte-CSF ( Colony Stimulating Factor ) . Intensification : High Dose Melphalan ( HDM ) perform within 3 week +/- 1 week follow stem cell harvest . After Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation , patient enter consolidation phase : Early consolidation ( consolidation part 1 ) start 2 month transplantation comprise 2 cycle MLN - Rd ( MLN R identical induction therapy low dose Dexamethasone ) . Late consolidation ( consolidation part 2 ) consist 6 additional cycle Ixazomib plus Lenalidomide . No Dexamethasone . Maintenance therapy start within 28 day last dose Lenalidomide last cycle Late Consolidation thirteen 28-day cycle ( approximately 12 month duration ) Patients see regular treatment cycle interval participate study . Response assess accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion disease progression . All patient follow survival progression .</detailed_description>
