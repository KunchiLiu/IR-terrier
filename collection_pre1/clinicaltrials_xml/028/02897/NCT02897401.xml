	<detailed_description>The study one visit take place : - Verification inclusion non-inclusion criterion . - Collection informed consent subject Given non-invasive nature procedure , period reflection give subject , however , information obtain consent make visit . - Collection 5 mL require pregnancy test woman childbearing age . This collection need fast . If test positive , subject include study . - Collection 30 mL urine need cotinine NNN quantitative analysis . This collection need fast . Then , urine sample divide two vial store -80 ° C : - 10 mL vial cotinine analysis , - 20 mL vial NNN analysis . - Realization Fagerstrom test ( FTCD ) order evaluate subject smoking . This test do group 4 ( group `` without nicotine '' ) - Measurement carbon monoxide exhale air If signing consent , subject realize urinate enough urine inclusion visiting , subject come back next working day make urine collection .</detailed_description>

Patients group 4 must urinary cotinine ≤ 10 ( cotinine / creatinine ratio Determination Cotinine DRI ) The threshold carbon monoxide clinical experience : Non current smoker : 0 5 part per million ( ppm ) Passive smoker : 6 9 ppm Current active smoker : 10 ppm Non inclusion criterion Rolling tobacco , cigar , cigarillo , pipe , bidi , chicha , cannabis smockers last 4 week Users tobacco snuff chewing tobacco last 4 week Users oral nicotine replacement therapy ( gum , lozenge , inhaler , oral spray ) last 4 week .

The result available inclusion visit . The included patient urinary cotinine level require group , secondarily exclude study . The number subject Groups 1 , 2 3 ratio cotinine would less 100 expect negligible.A102</criteria>
