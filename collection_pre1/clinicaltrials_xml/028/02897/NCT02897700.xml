	<brief_summary>The overarch purpose study determine mainstay chemotherapeutic regimen represent several genotoxic agent include limited Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Epirubicin , Fluorouracil Methotrexate ( CDEFM ) , format either single agent combination safe , tolerable , effective treatment patient infiltrate ductal carcinoma breast .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome Chemotherapy Surgical Patients With Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( IDC ) breast , sometimes call invasive ductal carcinoma breast , common type breast malignancy . About 80 % breast cancer IDCs . Once find , IDC usually already break wall milk duct begin invade tissue breast . Over time , IDC spread lymph node possibly area body high frequency . According statistic American Cancer Society , 180,000 woman United States diagnose IDC year . Although IDC affect woman age , common grow older . Further , approximately two-thirds woman 55 old diagnose symptom . The treatment invasive ductal carcinoma fall two broad category . First , local treatment IDC , include surgery radiation , treat primary tumor surround area chest lymph node . Second , systemic treatment IDC , include chemotherapy , hormone therapy target therapy , suppose deliver cytotoxicity throughout body eliminate cancer cell leave primary site help minimize risk recurrent disease . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I/II trial determine safety , tolerability efficacy single concurrent administration cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , epirubicin , fluorouracil methotrexate ( CDEFM ) woman undergo surgery infiltrate ductal carcinoma situ breast cancer . RATIONALE : This randomize , control , open-labeled multicenter , pilot study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( arm A B ) . Patients accrue control participant assign arm C. implement study , investigator collect surgical sample primary tumor periphery blood breast cancer patient assess effect chemotherapeutic regimen correlation post-therapy survival patient cohort . Besides five-year disease-free survival , overall survival five-year metastasis-free survival post treatment , investigator also analyze evaluate anticancer agent-induced tumor stroma damage extent , may provide evidence confirm treatment efficacy appraise potential influence damage tumor microenvironment disease progression regression clinical setting .</detailed_description>
