	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate f treatment NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant combination nivolumab safe useful patient certain type cancer . The study also investigate NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant nivolumab may represent substantial improvement available therapy nivolumab alone . All eligible patient receive NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant nivolumab trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine ( NEO-PV-01 ) w/ Nivolumab Patients With Melanoma , Lung Cancer Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial enroll patient metastatic advanced melanoma , lung , bladder cancer . The three agent use study : - A new , investigational , personalized cancer vaccine call `` NEO-PV-01 '' - Poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol ) , investigational adjuvant use help stimulate immune system - A cancer drug call nivolumab ( OPDIVO® ) These agent consider immunotherapy work stimulate immune system fight cancer . NEO-PV-01 truly personalize vaccine therapy custom design manufacture include target immune system present uniquely individual 's cancer . Poly-ICLC adjuvant help stimulate immune system make vaccine , NEO-PV-01 effective . Nivolumab help T-cells , certain type immune cell , recognize target reach attack tumor . Nivolumab clinical development treatment bladder cancer approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) treatment lung , skin , kidney , blood cancer . The purpose study find treatment NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant combination nivolumab safe effective patient melanoma , lung , bladder cancer . The study also see NEO-PV-01 vaccine + adjuvant nivolumab improve response compare available therapy nivolumab monotherapy The side effect NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant nivolumab monitor additional research test do assess immune response individual 's cancer .</detailed_description>
