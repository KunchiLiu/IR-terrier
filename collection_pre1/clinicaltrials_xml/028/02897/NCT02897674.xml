	<brief_summary>Aims : To investigate whether diet realistic dos palm oil effect lipid profile fat deposition healthy volunteer . Design : Randomized , parallel design 14 week include 2 week standardization period 12 week supplementation . In standardization period participant incorporate palm oil diet make 20 % calorie provide baseline measure . In supplementation period 12 week , volunteer randomize one three fat : palm olein , interesterified palm olein soybean oil , consume 20 % calorie fast remain 10 % fat calorie fat naturally occur food like meat nut . Otherwise participant keep rest diet habitual . Population : 60 healthy male female age 18 60 year , 30 participant BMI 18.5-24.9kg/m2 30 participant BMI 25-29.9kg/m2 fast plasma glucose evidence insulin resistance recruit . No pre-existing morbidity include cardiac , hepatic renal disease , history diabetes , hypertension hyperlipidemia . Treatment : Pre-intervention : Participants ask record habitual dietary intake completion 4-day food diary ask wear accelerometer armband assess physical activity begin end supplementation period . 2 week standardization period : All participant ask replace added fat diet palm olein provide two third 30 % fat calorie . At end standardization period , first day 12 week dietary intervention , well end 12 week supplementation , participant attend clinical research facility study visit . Weight , height waist circumference take ; total regional body composition measure MRI . Fasting post prandial plasma glucose , insulin , appetite hormone lipid measure . Participants ask come follow-up visit week 6 10 single blood sample weight check . 12 week supplementation period : participant randomize one three supplementation group : palm olein , interesterified palm olein soybean oil . Participants ask consume two third 30 % fat calorie one oil incorporate normal diet cooking baking .</brief_summary>
