	<brief_summary>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) effective treatment variety psychiatric disorder . However , despite continued advance ECT technique , neurocognitive dysfunction continue frequent adverse effect . Declarative memory less selective memory often impaired ECT course . Immediate memory , however , broadly preserve . It hypothesize memory impairment due ECT induce disruption long term potentiation well cerebral flux glutamatergic cholinergic system . Different pharmacological agent treatment ECT induce cognitive dysfunction try . Agents opioids , vasopressin , neuropeptides , cholinergic agent , thyroid hormone , stimulant use equivocal result , control study show clear efficacy . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive , painless brain stimulation treatment use direct electrical current stimulate specific part brain . Electrical current apply constantly low intensity ( 1-2 mA ) long period , usually minute ( 5-30 minute ) , achieve change cortical excitability influence spontaneous neural activity . There two type stimulation tDCS : anodal cathodal stimulation . Anodal stimulation act excite neuronal activity cathodal stimulation inhibits reduce neuronal activity . Several study demonstrate moderate strong effect size tDCS various neurocognitive neuropsychiatric setting . Majority study show positive effect tDCS cognitive functioning among healthy volunteer subject neurological psychiatric condition . Beneficial effect online stimulation apply left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex report working memory , attention information processing depress patient . To investigator ' knowledge study evaluate potential efficacy tDCS prevention ECT induce cognitive adverse effect . In current study , investigator propose double blind , randomize control trial test use tDCS strategy prevent mitigate memory impairment frequently associate ECT course .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , random assignment , double blind , parallel group study adaptive design compare efficacy tDCS perform course ECT sham tDCS patient major depressive episode treat ECT . The investigator intend recruit patient schedule receive acute course ECT . Patients able willing provide write informed consent , meet study criterion screen , randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive course real tDCS sham tDCS . Subjects receive standard acute course bifrontal ECT ( 3X/week ) depressive symptomatology monitor Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD-24 ) treatment . The primary outcome change cognition baseline end study . The investigator monitor cognitive change ECT treatment , end treatment course two month last treatment . Secondary outcome number treatment need achieve remission . Remission define two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD ) score &lt; = 10 , HRSD total score change &gt; 3 point remain &lt; 6 last two consecutive treatment . In addition , investigator collect data treatment parameter seizure duration , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) morphology well hemodynamic change .</detailed_description>
