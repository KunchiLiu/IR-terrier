	<brief_summary>The prevalence low back pain among person unilateral low limb amputation significantly high rate experience general public . Chronic pain , include low back pain , limit functional independence negatively impact quality life . As , project investigate role biomechanical casual pathway development low back pain ; , investigator explore relationship adopt neuromuscular pattern post-amputation perform activity daily live risk develop spinal tissue damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Unilateral Lower Limb Amputation Spinal Loads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite high prevalence low back pain ( LBP ) among person unilateral low limb amputation ( ULLA ) compare able-bodied individual , relatively little known fundamental mechanism underlying condition . This research represent first step toward investigate low back biomechanics use advanced computational modeling technique inform future design effective intervention LBP . Specifically , impact trunk neuromuscular pattern adopt person ULLA perform activity daily live spinal load risk spinal tissue damage investigate . This achieve via secondary biomechanical analysis large set high-quality kinematics data obtain individual without ULLA perform follow task : 1 ) walk self-selected controlled speed , 2 ) sit-to-stand stand-to-sit , 3 ) stairs-up stairs-down . The central hypothesis , compare able-bodied individual , trunk movement strategy adopt person ULLA cope physical demand common daily activity associate complex pattern internal muscle force result large load spine high probability spinal tissue damage . Investigators ' dataset draw Biomechanics Laboratory Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) unprecedented access large population service member ULLA . Using unique database , investigator implement novel finite element model approach estimate internal muscle force ( i.e. , adopt neuromuscular pattern ) need perform daily physical activity basis satisfy equilibrium stability across entire lumbar spine . Completion project enable investigator determine difference muscle recruitment , well resultant effect spinal load risk spinal tissue damage , person without ULLA . Hence , pilot project expect establish initial groundwork future research involve design highly specific intervention aim trunk neuromuscular behavior post-amputation rehabilitation lessen adverse effect low back biomechanics potential LBP .</detailed_description>
