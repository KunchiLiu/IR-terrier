	<brief_summary>Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy ( TTC ) , also know `` Broken Heart Syndrome '' , disorder heart occur commonly woman ( although occasionally occur men ) usually relate stressful event . Symptoms often similar heart attack , include chest pain shortness breath . Although Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy new medical condition , widely recognise last decade . Currently investigators n't exact understanding heart affect way , investigator conduct study help understand cause Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathogenesis Acute Stress Induced ( Tako-tsubo ) Cardiomyopathy : Energy Shut-Down Intense Inflammation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim study reciprocal modulation fatty acid glucose metabolism Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy physiology , human animal model , investigate metabolic pathway preferentially adopt acute Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy myocytes severe functional shut largely preserved variability . The human model use determine preferential stimulate uptake glucose/fatty acid optimal metabolic condition ( hyperinsulineamic euglycemic clamp 18F-Fludeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) fast 14Fluorine-18Fluoro-6-Thia-Heptadecanoic Acid ( 18F-FTHA cardiac Positron Emission Tomography ) ) . In rat model investigator examine metabolic tracer uptake ( use micro Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography ) well downstream modulation two metabolic pathway ( transcriptional regulator , mitochondrial respiration , expression uncoupling protein , level Adenosine Triphosphate generation reactive oxygen specie production ) . The investigator aim test hypothesis inflammation play pivotal role pathophysiology condition exploring : 1 ) In rat model define time course , extent subtypes cellular infiltrate , 2 ) In rat model Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy , demonstrate presence inflammatory macrophage use in-vivo Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide-cardiac magnetic resonance image whether relates number type macrophage present determined immunohistochemical analysis , 3 ) In clinical patient , define time course specific peripheral blood monocyte subset serum level inflammatory cytokine versus match control 4 ) In clinical patient , establish compartmentalisation tissue macrophages leave ventricle time course resolution use Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance . The investigator ass psycho-emotional factor involve Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy give majority case intense emotional trauma immediately precede onset .</detailed_description>
