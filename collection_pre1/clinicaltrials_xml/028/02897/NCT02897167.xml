	<brief_summary>The study immune pathway involve etiopathogeny schizophrenia would important advance understand mechanism involve development disease would turn point drug therapy . Until , mechanism action antipsychotic focus blockade modulation brain dopaminergic pathway . If immunological pathway responsible neuroinflammation neurodegeneration involve alteration different area brain pathway ( include dopaminergic pathway ) discover , investigator could develop new treatment act new target , allow delay onset first psychotic episode improve evolution impact disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Activation Proinflammatory Pathways Toll-like Receptors Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia mental illness affect approximately 1 % population . It suppose important impact patient socio-health system , since patient difficulty autonomous independent life need health , economic social resource lifetime . Until recently , etiopathogeny schizophrenia explain combination genetic environmental factor . However , recent year increase evidence involvement immune system development evolution schizophrenia least subset patient . Although several meta-analyzes publish increase decrease interleukin proinflammatory molecule describe , immune pathway involve development evolution schizophrenia still unknown . The first observation relate immune system disorder development non-affective psychosis make century ago describe association pathogen infection ( virus , protozoa spirochete ) occurence psychosis . Pathogens directly affect neuron brain structure , increase release free radical oxygen nitrogen indirectly alter activation innate adaptive immune system . They publish current epidemiological study support theory argue increase risk psychotic decompensation hospitalization . Furthermore , know many gene involve schizophrenia match gene involve defense pathogens attack . Several epidemiological study objectify association autoimmune diseases and/or chronic inflammatory disease ( intestinal , vasculitis , etc . ) mental disorder schizophrenia , stress one important trigger factor development pathology . Considering case onset autoimmune disease chronic inflammatory precedes first psychotic episode , hypothesize autoimmune reaction trigger psychotic symptom . However , although study show statistically significant involvement interleukin ( increase interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) mainly ) development exacerbation schizophrenia , level interleukin alter cause cardiovascular disease , obesity metabolic syndrome ; condition highly prevalent patient schizophrenia . The innate immune system consist various immune cell ( macrophage , mast cell , dendritic cell , microglia , leukocyte , etc . ) recognize pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMPs ) damage-associated molecular pattern molecule ( DAMPs ) receptorial system call pattern-recognition receptor ( PRRs ) , locate cell surface cytoplasm . Toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) one important family PRRs . They transmembrane protein extracellular domain bind ligands intracellular domain bind protein complex initiate intracellular transduction pathway . Among 11 known , TLRs study schizophrenia TLR-4 . Multiple study objectify TLRs express neurodevelopment early stage life also important role neurodevelopment neuronal plasticity adulthood . Microglia phagocytic cell locate central nervous system ( CNS ) know express various type TLRs . Its role regulatory cell CNS do via intracellular signal pathway initiate TLRs . Depending activate signal route , microglia perform different function : involve positively immune response , neurodevelopmental , neuronal plasticity synaptogenesis , otherwise production proinflammatory cytokine free radical oxygen nitrogen favor neuroinflammation cerebral neurotoxicity . Some epidemiological experimental study animal human suggest infection virus , bacteria protozoa prenatal phase ( especially first quarter ) represent major risk factor prenatal inflammation , abnormality neurodevelopment , obstetric complication behavioral change similar observe schizophrenia patient . TLRs cause neuronal damage fetus two intracellular signal pathway : increase cytokine production and/or antimicrobial factor produce maintain activation microglia . Both increase cytokine antimicrobial factor maintain activation microglia cause accumulation free radical oxygen nitrogen , result neurodegeneration , necrosis and/or apoptosis , lead change structure brain function , normal process child neurodevelopment . It known excessive activation microglia may lead reduction synapsis glutaminergic neuron brain area cerebral cortex , hippocampus basal ganglion , similar glutamatergic hypofunction find brain schizophrenia patient . In addition , several study publish demonstrate anti-inflammatory antioxidant property antipsychotic , suggest effectiveness due action dopaminergic receptor ( classical theory ) also modulatory effect immune system .</detailed_description>
