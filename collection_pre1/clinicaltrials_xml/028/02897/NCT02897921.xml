	<detailed_description>Background : Many myopathy inherit recessive manner , recessively inherited disorder , clinical manifestation may potentially manifest carrier single mutation . This recently demonstrate researcher recessively inherit limb girdle muscle dystrophy ( LGMD ) type 2A , carrier single mutation also symptomatic . In X-linked recessively inherited dystrophinopathies cause mutation DMD gene chromosome Xp21 , female mutation carrier may also manifest disease , although often milder affected men . In recently discover LGMD2L , manifest carrier also suspect . Thus , accord statistic , many person evaluate myopathy carry single LGMD2L mutation . Some previous study look significance single mutation carrier recessive muscle disease . In dystrophinopathy , report 5 % female DMD carrier report myalgia cramp , 17 % experienced mild-to-moderate muscle weakness 8 % experience dilate cardiomyopathy , mean onset age approximately 30 year . Another study find echocardiographic examination abnormal 38 % DMD female carrier - dilate cardiomyopathy , leave ventricle dilatation . Overall , however significance carry single mutation recessive myopathy widely unexplored . No study yet investigate characteristic single mutation carrier recessive myopathy observational , cross-sectional study . Aim : In study , clinical characteristic single mutation carrier recessive myopathy investigate . The investigation include sceletal muscle degeneration strength , well cardiac status . Recruitment Methods : Estimated total subject recruit 200 know recessive gene mutation , 40 healthy control . In former study 40 healthy volunteer already investigate , thereby give total 80 healthy control . Recessive gene carrier recruit obtain via Department Clinical Genetics Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center , Rigshospitalet , thus include carrier aware carrier status . 2 day test per participant . Day one : Measuring S-creatine kinase level ( blood sampling ) , muscle strength ( Biodex 4 Isokinetic Dynamometer ) , ECG , Holter monitor device application . Day two : Holter monitor device removal , Dixon MRI analysis gadolinium contrast medium , echocardiography . Healthy control take part MRI-scanning isokinetic dynamometer test . Trials expect carried October 2016 May 2020 .</detailed_description>
