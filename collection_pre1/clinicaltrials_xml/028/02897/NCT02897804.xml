	<brief_summary>The overall objective propose research reduce incidence sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) among college student . The investigator propose accomplish use innovative , engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy ( MOST ) develop highly effective , appeal , economical , readily scalable internet-delivered behavioral intervention target intersection alcohol use sexual risk behavior . The rate STIs college campus alarm : one four college student diagnosed STI least college experience . Sexual activity drink alcohol highly prevalent among college student . Alcohol use know contribute sexual risk behavior responsible transmission STIs , namely unprotected sex , contact numerous partner , `` hook-ups '' ( casual sexual encounter ) . Few intervention develop explicitly target intersection alcohol use sexual risk behavior , none optimize . In order reduce incidence STI transmission among high-risk group , new approach need . MOST comprehensive methodological framework bring power engineering principle bear optimization behavioral intervention . MOST enables researcher experimentally test individual component intervention determine effectiveness , indicate component need revise re-tested . Given high rate alcohol use sex among college student , college set provide ideal opportunity intervene alcohol use sexual risk behavior . The propose study include diverse population college student 4 campus increase generalizability finding . The specific aim ( 1 ) develop pilot test initial set online intervention component target link alcohol use sexual risk behavior , ( 2 ) use MOST approach build optimize preventive intervention , ( 3 ) evaluate effectiveness newly optimize preventive intervention use fully power randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This work result new , potent behavioral intervention reduce incidence STIs among college student US , lay groundwork new generation highly effective STI prevention intervention aim subpopulation risk .</brief_summary>
