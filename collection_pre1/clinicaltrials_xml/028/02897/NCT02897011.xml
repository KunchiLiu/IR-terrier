	<brief_title>2-week dc MTX Influenza Vaccination RA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic systemic inflammatory disease affect joint main target inflammation . Patients RA require chronic treatment disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) include methotrexate ( MTX ) , constitute mainstay treatment . Underlying immune dysfunction additional immune suppression associate treatment render patient RA susceptible infection . Thus , vaccination preventive disease crucial recommend patient unless contraindicate . However , low dose glucocorticoid , conventional DMARDs biological DMARDs include tumor necrosis factor inhibitor report substantially decrease vaccine response ( 4 ) ; MTX report associate decreased response seasonal influenza vaccination 15 % . To optimize vaccine response , vaccination administrate treatment immunesuppressive medication initiate . However , patient RA already stable dose MTX time vaccination . To improve vaccine response , short term discontinuation MTX could consider . In prior study , discover temporary discontinuation MTX 4 week peri-vaccination period tend associate improved response vaccination trivalent influenza vaccination ( Figure 1 ) . It remain defined whether MTX discontinuation shorter period increase vaccination efficacy minimize RA flare rate .</detailed_description>
