	<detailed_description>Taxane induce peripheral neuropathy ( TIPN ) affect many female breast cancer survivor treat taxane chemotherapy . This condition include symptom range minor loss sensory function , numbness mild paresthesia frank pain include burn tingle sensation shoot neuropathic pain . Treating TIPN difficult time conventional treatment primarily limit use antidepressant anticonvulsant , significant efficacy safety issue often little reduction TIPN . The mechanisms taxane induce peripheral tissue damage become clearer allow potential develop specific intervention resolve pain associated class drug . Acupuncture treatment use symptom improvement patient peripheral neuropathy cause HIV diabetes mellitus ; however , study evaluate acupuncture viable treatment taxane induce peripheral neuropathy . Moreover , little research consider biological effect acupuncture treatment related mechanism pain resolution . This study enroll female breast cancer survivor Greenville Health System Cancer Institute Center Integrative Oncology Survivorship undergo acupuncture protocol consist traditional acupuncture point use neuropathic pain . This prospective , randomize , control trial consist two arm . The two arm consist 1 ) acupuncture plus conventional therapy 2 ) conventional therapy ( n= 9 participant arm ) . Arm 1 receive traditional manual acupuncture protocol twice week 6 week week 6 week conjunction standard care treatment . Arm 2 receive standard care treatment ; acupuncture offer individual 12 week waitlist . The 18 participant start individualize 12 week study schedule recruit 4 month time period . This study assess severity pain , inflammatory biomarkers , circulate level mitochondrial DNA baseline , 6 week , 12 week arm questionnaire blood test . Results study clarify acupuncture 's role therapeutic modality manage pain induce TIPN provide evidence could help unlock good understanding action .</detailed_description>
