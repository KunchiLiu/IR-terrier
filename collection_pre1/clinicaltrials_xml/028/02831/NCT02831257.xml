	<brief_title>AZD2014 In NF2 Patients With Progressive Symptomatic Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The goal clinical research study learn study drug AZD2014 shrink grow symptomatic meningioma . Based laboratory research , cellular pathway block AZD2014 important growth survival meningioma . Further treatment meningioma cell laboratory set result decreased survival tumor cell . As , purpose research see whether treat meningioma AZD2014 result tumor shrinkage . The safety AZD2014 also study . Your physical state , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain on-study help research team decide AZD2014 safe effective patient condition . AZD2014 study patient various cancer single agent ( drug use alone treat cancer ) combination number anticancer therapy . Previous study also allow investigator determine best dose frequency AZD2014 achieve anti-tumor effect reduce likelihood side effect . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve AZD2014 treatment disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must confirm diagnosis neurofibromatosis 2 fulfilling National Institute Health ( NIH ) criteria Manchester criterion , detection causative mutation NF2 gene . Participants must progressive symptomatic meningioma . NOTE 1 : Histologic confirmation meningioma require set compatible radiographic appearance , NOTE2 : progression define increase target meningioma volume ≥ 20 % OR ≥ 3 mm past 2 year . Subjects must target meningioma amenable surgery due patient preference high risk surgical complication Participants must willing able undergo regular MRI scan brain Patients must measurable disease , define least one meningioma ≥ 1.0 ml accurately measure contrastenhanced cranial MRI scan , perform within 28 day study registration . Prior surgical resection radiation therapy progressive meningioma require study enrollment . Patients must receive less 3 prior chemotherapy regimen progressive meningioma . Patients receive dexamethasone must able treated alternative corticosteroid prednisone , prednisolone , methylprednisolone opinion treat physician . Patients must available archival paraffin tumor block sufficient generate least 20 unstained slide ; , paraffin tumor block unavailable , least 20 unstained slide . Age ≥ 18 year time study enrollment . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) deterioration previous 2 week Life expectancy great 3 month Within 14 day study registration , participant must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL hemoglobin ≥90 g/L platelet ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal concurrent creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) , confirmation creatinine clearance require creatinine &gt; 1.5xULN Urine protein ≤1+ urine dipstick ( 2+ see first test , retest least 24 hour later ) PT/INR/PTT ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal The effect AZD2014 develop human fetus unknown . For reason mTOR kinase inhibit agent know teratogenic , female patient must willing use 2 form highly effective contraception ( per institution standard ) time screen 4 week discontinue study , must breast feeding must negative pregnancy test prior start dose child bear potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential fulfil one follow criterion screen : ( 1 ) postmenopausal woman , define either woman age 50 year amenorrhoeic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , , ( 2 ) woman 50 year old amenorrhoeic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level postmenopausal range institution . Alternatively , woman must documentation irreversible surgical sterilisation hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation . Male patient either surgically sterile willing use effective barrier method contraception study 16 week follow last dose study treatment sexually active female childbearing potential . If do previously , storage sperm prior receive AZD2014 advise male patient desire child . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document prior study specific procedure , sample , analysis . Ability swallow retain oral medication Prior chemotherapy , biological therapy , radiation therapy , androgen , thalidomide , immunotherapy , anticancer agent within 21 day start study treatment ( include palliative radiotherapy focal site ) . Prior use investigational monoclonal antibody therapy within 3 month , prior use nitrosoureas mitomycin C within 6 week . Patients must recover acute toxicity due radiotherapy . With exception alopecia , unresolved toxicity prior antitumor treatment ( exclude corticosteroid ) great CTCAE ( Version 4.0 ) Grade 1 time study entry . Major surgery within 4 week prior entry study ( exclude placement vascular access ) , minor surgery ( exclude tumor biopsy ) within 14 day first dose study treatment Participation another clinical study investigational product last 21 day . History hypersensitivity active inactive excipients AZD2014 drug similar chemical structure class AZD2014 . Exposure potent moderate inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 , Pgp ( MDR1 ) BCRP take within state washout period first dose study treatment ( see Appendix B ) Exposure sensitive narrow therapeutic range substrate drug metabolize enzyme CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 drug transporter Pgp ( MDR1 ) , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 OCT2 within appropriate washout period ( minimum 5 x report elimination halflife ) first dose study treatment ( see Appendix B ) Any haemopoietic growth factor ( e.g. , filgrastim [ granulocyte colonystimulating factor ; GCSF ] , sargramostim [ granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor ; GMCSF ] ) within 14 day prior receive study treatment.. Pretreatment mTOR inhibitor may allow discuss protocol tumor type separately Current refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis , partial complete bowel obstruction .

Screening chronic condition require . History malignancy , except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥5 year first dose study drug felt low risk recurrence treat physician , ( 2 ) adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease , ( 3 ) adequately treat carcinoma situ without evidence disease , ( 4 ) Gleason 6 prostate cancer observation .
