	<brief_title>Protected PCI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study assess safety efficacy IMPELLA® 2.5 System subject undergo non-emergent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) post market approval . The primary endpoint composite clinical endpoint major adverse event 90 day follow PCI procedure . The outcome compare pre specify performance goal 53 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Signed Informed Consent 2 . Subject indicate NON emergent percutaneous treatment least one de novo restenotic lesion native coronary vessel bypass graft per judgement heart team include surgeon 3 . Age eligible ( 18 ≤ Age ≤ 90 ) 4 . Subject present : 1 . Ejection Fraction≤ 35 % AND least one follow criterion : Intervention last patent coronary conduit , Intervention unprotected leave main coronary artery Or 2 . Ejection Fraction ≤ 30 % intervention patient present triple vessel disease . *threevessel triple vessel disease define least one significant stenosis* three major epicardial territory : Left Anterior Descending ( LAD ) Artery and/or side branch , leave circumflex ( LCX ) artery and/or side branch , Right Coronary Artery ( RCA ) side branch . *Significant stenosis define least 50 % diameter stenosis visual estimate total occlusion . In case leave coronary artery dominance , lesion LAD proximal LCX qualifies threevessel disease . 1 . ST Myocardial Infarction within 24 hour CKMB normalize 2 . Preprocedure cardiac arrest within 24 hour enrolment require CPR 3 . Subject inotrope dependent cardiogenic shock define : Hypotension ( systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg &gt; 30 minute need supportive measure maintain systolic BP great equal 90 mmHg ) AND end organ hypoperfusion ( cool extremity OR urine output &lt; 30 ml/hour ) 4 . Mural thrombus leave ventricle 5 . Patient schedule revascularization total chronic occlusion ( CTO ) transcatheter aortic valve replacement within 1 year index procedure . 6 . The presence mechanical aortic valve heart constrictive device 7 . Documented presence aortic stenosis ( aortic stenosis grade ≥ +2 equivalent orifice area 1.5cm2 less . 8 . Documented presence moderate severe aortic insufficiency ( echocardiographic assessment aortic insufficiency grade ≥ +2 ) 9 . Severe peripheral arterial obstructive disease would preclude IMPELLA System device placement 10 . Abnormalities aorta would preclude surgery , include aneurysms extreme tortuosity calcification 11 . Subject renal failure ( creatinine ≥ 4mg/dL dialysis ) 12 . Subject history debilitate liver dysfunction elevation liver enzymes bilirubin level ≥ 3x ULN INR ( Internationalized Normalized Ratio ) ≥ 2 13 .
