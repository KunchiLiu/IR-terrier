	<brief_summary>ACS examine potential influence intermittent physical activity break various intensity ( control , light , moderate , vigorous ) measure immediate mental performance , mood , hunger several metabolic outcome child age 7-11 year . We build upon previous work hypothesize higher-intensity intermittent physical activity break throughout 8-hour day improve immediate mental performance , mood , post-exercise physical activity level , reduce hunger post-exercise food intake .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Class Space Metabolic Benefits Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A range metabolic , behavioral , mental physical health benefit regular physical activity document adult child long-term . Yet , relatively little known child 's usual daily physical activity pattern ( i.e . small burst throughout day ) affect acute ( immediately post-activity ) short-term ( 72 hour post-activity ) metabolic psychosocial outcome . Additionally , little know specific pattern physical activity affect subsequent physical activity level ( i.e . compensatory behavior ) subsequent dietary intake , short-term- information critical designing effective intervention involve physical environment school classroom . Overall Goal : Active Class Space ( ACS ) examine potential influence intermittent physical activity break various intensity ( control , light , moderate , vigorous ) measure immediate mental performance , mood , hunger several metabolic outcome child age 7-11 year . We build upon previous work hypothesize higher-intensity intermittent physical activity break throughout 8-hour day improve immediate mental performance , mood , post-exercise physical activity level , reduce hunger post-exercise food intake . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To determine effect intermittent physical activity break vary intensity immediate mental performance , hunger satiety ; ( 2 ) To determine effect intermittent activity break vary intensity rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) , perceive exercise enjoyment , in-task mood , post-exercise food intake post-exercise physical activity level ; ( 3 ) To examine gender difference precede variable response low- , moderate , high-intensity intermittent physical activity . Design : Eighteen healthy male twenty-one healthy female age 7-11 year complete complete four experimental condition random order : ( 1 ) 8 hour sit interrupted 2 -- minute , light -- intensity activity break perform 25 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) every 18 minutes; ( 2 ) 8 hour sit interrupted 2 -- minute , moderate -- intensity activity break ( 50 % HRR ) ; ( 3 ) 8 hour sit interrupted 2 -- minute , high -- intensity activity break ( 75 % HRR ) ; ( 4 ) 8 hour sit interrupt 2 minute sedentary screen time . Standardized meal provide experimental condition . Dietary intake physical activity level monitor remainder experimental day subsequent three day condition . Dependent Variables : Major outcome variable include : Energy expenditure measure indirect calorimetry heart rate ; dietary intake measure use 3-day dietary record ; physical activity measure accelerometry ; immediate mental performance assess use 90-sec mathematical computation test ; hunger satiety assess use visual analog scale ; RPE assess use Borg scale ; perceive exercise enjoyment assess use physical activity enjoyment scale ( PACES ) ; in-task mood assess use Feeling Scale ( FS ) Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale ( SEES ) . Data Analysis : A linear mixed model fit outcome variable effect condition , sex , BMI , baseline physical activity level . A Bonferroni correction use adjust multiple comparison post hoc test follow mixed-effect model . A similar linear mixed-model raw level outcome variable time also fit assess temporal difference condition . This model include effect condition , time , time-by-condition interaction , sex , BMI , baseline physical activity level . Significance : ACS shed new light short-term metabolic , behavioral , mental physical health benefit intermittent physical activity break child . The result study inform design behavioral environmental intervention promote physical activity cognitive development pediatric population .</detailed_description>
