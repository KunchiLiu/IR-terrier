	<brief_summary>Summary 1 . Purpose Objective : The purpose study test feasibility rapid acquisition point care 3D ultrasound obtain abdominal and/or pelvic image . The study use newly develop acquisition method post-processing technique create three dimensional image model abdomen and/or pelvis . 2 . Study activity population group . The study population convenience sample patient age present Emergency Department complaint necessitate clinical abdominal and/or pelvic imaging . The study intervention include acquisition research ultrasound image , use clinical care , comparison image clinically obtain image . Other clinical data surgical pathology report also review . 3.Data analysis risk/safety issue . This pilot study intend determine feasibility refine image reconstruction algorithm . Research image compare clinical image . Comparison research image final diagnosis also occur . The research intervention , ultrasound exam , know safety risk . The risk subject loss confidentiality . This study observational , interventional , experimental ultrasound perform subject use clinical care patient ( consequently , opportunity affect clinical outcome ) . Experimental image review completion clinical care provide clinician care subject . The investigator measure effect ultrasound examination subject ' outcome .</brief_summary>
