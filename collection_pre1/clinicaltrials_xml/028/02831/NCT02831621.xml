	<brief_summary>Excess ectopic fat deposition associate development cardiovascular metabolic disease . This study investigate lifestyle intervention effect different site ectopic fat deposition cardiovascular metabolic factor . Moreover , clinical economic value exercise supplement hypocaloric diet investigate . Endocrinologists University Hospital Antwerp , Belgium , recruit woman consultation . Also , recruitment poster use University Hospital Antwerp University Antwerp . Potential participant meet priori set inclusion exclusion criterion randomize minimization method hypocaloric diet group ( usual care ) group hypocaloric diet combine physical fitness training . Both group undergo intake procedure personal goal set barrier change behavior discuss . Ectopic fat deposition measure image technique three six month intervention . A post-intervention follow-up period six month plan . Based know relationship ectopic fat cardiovascular outcome , short term study result extrapolate estimation reduction cardiovascular event . The following clinical outcome present : change ectopic fat abdomen ( visceral fat ) , liver ( intra hepatic lipid ) , skeletal muscle ( intra myocellular lipid ) , heart ( epicardial fat ) dietary combine ( diet+physical activity ) intervention . The impact supervise exercise addition diet express project healthcare cost quality adjust life year .</brief_summary>
