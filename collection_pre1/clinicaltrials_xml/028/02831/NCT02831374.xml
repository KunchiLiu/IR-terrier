	<brief_summary>Purpose : This prospective randomize comparative clinical study conduct assess effect platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) gel soft tissue heal bone regeneration potential low third molar extraction socket . Methods : For study , 50 Patients ( 37 male , 13 female ) require surgical removal lower impacted third molar fulfil inclusion criterion recruit . The patient categorize two group , Group A Group B . For group 25 patient randomly allocate . The predictor variable Group A application PRP Gel whereas Group B PRP . Postoperative pain , swell , trismus , soft tissue heal osseous regeneration assess use standard method . These outcome variable assess 1 , 3- , 5- , 7- , 14-postoperative day . Patients recall 4th , 10th , 16th postoperative week assessment bone healing . The data record tabulate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design prospective randomize comparative clinical study . The sample population compose fifty consecutive patient need surgical extraction lower third molar local anesthesia . The study include 37 male 13 female age range 20 40 year . All Patients categorize GROUP A ( wound PRP place ) GROUP B ( socket without PRP ) . The patient allocate randomly group equally single-blind technique , irrespective age sex . Ethical approval obtain Institutional Ethics Committee prior begin study . The signed consent form obtain patient explain risk benefit surgical procedure . The group A ( test group ) receive topical application PRP , whereas group B ( control group ) leave heal without PRP . Clinical assessment : Postoperative pain assess use 10-point visual analog scale ( VAS ) score 0 equal `` pain '' 10 equal `` severe pain '' Facial swell assessed modification Schultze-Mosgau et al method , involve measure length tragus oral commissure tragus pogonion . The arithmetic sum two measurement consider facial swell time point . The maximum distance maxillary central incisor mandibular central incisor take mouth open . The difference postoperative preoperative mouth open value consider trismus . Assessment soft tissue heal base criterion give Landry et al . Gonshor et al . Third molar socket assess radiographically bone heal modification Kelley 's method describe Olufemi et al . The percentage facial swell mouth opening estimate use method describe Ogundipe et al . Protocol preparation PRP gel Under aseptic condition , PRP process mean modification method Sonnleitner et al . Before surgery , 10 mL venous blood collect antecubital fossa patient 's forearm store sterile tube contain anticoagulant ( 0.5 mL citrate phosphate dextrose ) patient group A experimental group use routine venipuncture procedure . The tube thoroughly agitated ensure mix anticoagulant venous blood . The whole blood centrifuge 1,200 rpm ten minute . The supernatant layer obtain platelet poor plasma ( PPP ) Buffy coat ( BC ) RBCs ( red blood cell ) bottom part . PPP , BC upper 1-2 mm RBC ( red blood cell ) layer collect new sterile tube centrifuge 1,000 rpm 10 min . The upper half supernatant remove low half mixed carefully get PRP . The platelet concentration PRP note . PRP gel prepare add Five drop mixture 10 % CaCl2 1000 U bovine thrombin 2mL ( milliliter ) PRP use extraction socket . Surgical procedure The surgical extraction procedure patient carry operator . After achieve Local anesthesia use 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride 1:100,000 epinephrine , standard Terrence Ward 's incision place raise full thickness mucoperiosteal flap . Distobuccal bone carefully expose bone surround buccal aspect impact tooth perform use surgical bur copious irrigation 0.9 % saline . The tooth elevate use Coupland elevator require situation tooth section surgical bur facilitate removal . The socket check tooth bony debris . The bony margin smoothen use file irrigate normal saline . Subsequently , PRP gel place extraction socket patient group A wound closure do use simple interrupt 3.0 black silk suture . In group B wound close without application PRP gel . Patients advise regular post extraction prescribe 500 mg paracetamol postoperatively ( 1 tablet every 6 h 2 day ) . All patient also advise consume medication advise get medical help somewhere else postoperative discomfort pain without prior information operator . The patient review postoperatively 1- , 3- , 5- , 7- , 14-day record pain , mouth opening , Soft tissue bony heal index . Patients recall 4th , 10th , 16th postoperative week assessment bone healing . Statistical analysis : The data analyze use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) version 21 . Descriptive statistic mean , SD ( standard deviation ) percentage use . Normality data test use Kolmogorov Smirnov method . Unpaired t-test use compare group normally data Mann-Whitney test non-normally data . For categorical variable , Chi-square test employed . A p-value le 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
