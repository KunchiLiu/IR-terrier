	<brief_title>Effect TTFields ( 150 kHz ) Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Patients With 1-10 Brain Metastases Following Radiosurgery ( METIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field ( TTFields , TTF ) demonstrate significant activity vitro vivo NSCLC pre-clinical model single modality treatment combination chemotherapy . TTFields also show inhibit metastatic spread malignant melanoma vivo experiment . In pilot study , 42 patient advanced NSCLC tumor progression least one line prior chemotherapy , receive pemetrexed together TTFields ( 150 kHz ) apply chest upper abdomen disease progression ( Pless M. , et al. , Lung Cancer 2011 ) . Efficacy endpoints remarkably high compare historical data pemetrexed alone . In addition , phase III trial Optune® ( 200 kHz ) monotherapy compare active chemotherapy recurrent glioblastoma patient show TTFields equivalent active chemotherapy extend survival , associate minimal toxicity , good quality life , activity within brain ( 14 % response rate ) ( Stupp R. , et al. , EJC 2012 ) . Finally , phase III trial Optune® combine maintenance temozolomide compare maintenance temozolomide alone show combined therapy lead significant improvement progression free survival overall survival patient newly diagnose glioblastoma without addition high grade toxicity without decline quality life ( Stupp R. , et al. , JAMA 2015 ) . Applying TTFields 150 kHz brain treatment 1-5 brain metastasis NSCLC use NovoTTF-100M device demonstrate safe pilot study , patient randomize local therapy brain metastasis neurosurgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery receive either NovoTTF-100M treatment supportive care alone . Eighteen ( 18 ) patient enrol study . There device-related serious adverse event ( SAE ) report date ( Brozova H. , et al. , Neuro Oncol 2016 ) . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : All patient include trial patient 1-10 supratentorial brain metastasis NSCLC amenable stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . In addition , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Eligible patient randomly assign one two group : 1 . Patients undergo SRS follow TTFields use NovoTTF-100M System 2 . Patients undergo SRS alone receive supportive care . Patients arm study may receive systemic therapy NSCLC discretion treat physician . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio . Baseline test perform patient enrolled arm . If assign NovoTTF-100M group , patient treat continuously device second cerebral progression . On arm , patient recur anywhere brain offer one follow salvage treatment ( accord local practice ) include , limited : - Surgery - Repeat SRS - Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) Patients control arm offer cross NovoTTF-100M arm study receive TTFields salvage therapy second cerebral progression investigator believe best interest patient patient agree . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 150 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make Novocure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular component cell change location within divide cell , disrupt normal function ultimately lead cell death.. In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields interfere normal orientation tiny motor relate cellular component since electrically-charged well . As result two effect , tumor cell division slow , result cellular death revers continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . Finally , frequency TTFields apply type cancer specific may damage normally divide cell healthy tissue . In conclusion , TTFields hold promise serve brand new treatment brain metastasis NSCLC side effect .</detailed_description>
