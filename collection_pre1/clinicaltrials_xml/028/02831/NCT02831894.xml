	<brief_summary>Treatment-seeking insomnia sufferer often present primary care venue first usually treatment prescription sedative hypnotic , typically benzodiazepine ( BZD ) new benzodiazepine receptor agonist ( BzRA ) . For patient , short-term intermittent use provide satisfactory insomnia relief . However , 65 % individual prescribe hypnotic use year , &gt; 30 % remain agent five year . Whereas patient may appreciate partial full relief insomnia symptom ongoing hypnotic use , continuous long-term use agent may represent optimal therapy . A sizable proportion insomnia patient participate non-drug insomnia therapy cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy ( CBT-I ) achieve sustain insomnia remission long time-limited course treatment . However , difficult long-term hypnotic user convert use medication self-management approach . Interventions combine CBT-I supervised medication tapering ( SMT ) show great promise achieve outcome , almost 50 % patient receive assistance either fail discontinue hypnotic return even achieve short-term abstinence . Previous research provide rudimentary understand help long-term hypnotic user discontinue sleep aid successfully manage insomnia CBT-I technique . Limitations exist research include failure consider : 1. pace hypnotic withdrawal influence outcomes ; 2. patient characteristic belief need sleep medication , anxiety sensitivity moderate outcome ; 3. hypnotic withdrawal symptom change sleep quality mediate outcome . This R34 project gather key pilot data address limitation . Specifically , project compare currently recommend taper pace ( 25 % dose reduction every two week ) slower taper pace ( 10 % dose reduction every two week ) taper condition determine influence taper pace outcome . The study also examine participant ' belief need hypnotic , anxiety sensitivity , hypnotic dose , half-life time use moderator outcomes . The influence hypnotic withdrawal symptom level sleep disturbance withdrawal test mediator outcomes . Enrollees ( N=75 ) first complete CBT-I randomize taper pace ( n=25 per SMT pace ) . Target moderator mediator examine assess influence outcome . Primary outcome include drop-out rate hypnotic discontinuation rate observe SMT pace . Investigators tally rate achieve hypnotic dose reduction SMT return hypnotic use 3-month follow-up secondary endpoint . Results inform future R01-level clinical trial focus taper pace , patient characteristic moderate effect taper pace , psychophysiological process mediate effect taper pace . This line research inform clinical practice help refine guideline taper pace provide successful , person-centered intervention</brief_summary>
