	<brief_summary>The current standard Prostate Cancer ( PCa ) detection remain take 10-12 systematic biopsy prostate . This approach lead overdiagnosis insignificant PCa one hand underdiagnosis undergrading significant PCa . multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( mpMRI ) see increase uptake clinic biopsy target , value biopsy naive patient remain controversial . With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound ( CEUS ) cancer induce neovascularisation visualise potential improve ultrasound image prostate cancer detection localisation significantly . The past year numerous study perform CEUS , base result subjective judgement investigator . To overcome difficulty CEUS quantification technique use encourage first result . These image technique propose improve yield prostate biopsy possibly replace systematic biopsy . In trial mpMRI image CEUS + quantification perform primary biopsy . Using fusion device , target biopsy take predefined MRI lesion CEUS lesion , together standard systematic biopsy patient separate blind clinician . The main outcome measure per-patient ( significant ) prostate cancer detection rate biopsy regimen .</brief_summary>
