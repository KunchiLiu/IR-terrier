	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together capecitabine temozolomide treat patient neuroendocrine tumor spread place body usually cure controlled treatment , return period improvement , remove surgery . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spreading .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) veliparib ( ABT-888 ) combination capecitabine temozolomide patient advance well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 2 . To determine safety profile combination capecitabine , temozolomide veliparib patient advance well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) . 3 . To evaluate antitumor activity combination capecitabine , temozolomide veliparib advance well-differentiated NET patient 4 . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination capecitabine , temozolomide , veliparib advance well-differentiated NET patient IV . To evaluate association pharmacodynamic biomarkers response patient advance well-differentiated NET patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 , temozolomide PO BID day 10-14 veliparib PO BID day 10-14 . Courses repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
