	<detailed_description>Swimming water-based physical activity represent effective form aerobic-dynamic exercise . However , exist guideline mainly advise caution recommend water-based activity patient coronary artery disease . To date , safety efficacy short-term water-based exercise patient coronary artery diseases scarcely address . Cardiovascular rehabilitation integral part management myocardial infarction coronary procedure . Most rehabilitation program exercise-based , since beneficial effect physical activity undisputed , corroborate large body evidence . Most rehabilitation program exercise-based , since beneficial effect physical activity undisputed , corroborate large body evidence . Research mainly focus impact assessment standard form physical training , study various form physical exercise , mainly land-based . No previous study report effect exercise water integral element standard cardiac rehabilitation coronary patient exercise capacity , vascular function , arrhythmogenic potential cardiac autonomic function , marker neurohormonal activity , activate hemostasis inflammation .</detailed_description>
