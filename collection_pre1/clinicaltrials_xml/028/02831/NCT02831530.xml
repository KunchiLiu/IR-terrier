	<brief_summary>Cyclins CDK4 / 6 extensively involved proliferation growth numerous cancer include breast cancer . The objective study identify new preoperative oral treatment , abemaciclib direct CDK / 6 compare treatment , inhibit tumor growth induce senescence ( age ) tumor . This early study offer woman go operated breast cancer expression hormone receptor ( ER / PR ) . These woman 3 chance receive one 14 day wait period surgery abemaciclib tablet . Other patient receive treatment . The decision receive treatment do random computer draw . The drug 's effectiveness evaluate primarily biological parameter tumor compare surgery treatment . These result biomarkers allow u good know treatment eventually used future identify patient treatment abemaciclib efficiency . Patients treat protocol receive treatment entirely conventional breast cancer within parameter tumor : participation limit time .</brief_summary>

Candidates initial breast surgery minimum tumor size 11 mm measure breast ultrasound . Bilateral multifocal tumor allow , assume tumor evaluation pre posttreatment biopsy perform target lesion . 5 . HRpositive ( define either ER PR expression &gt; 10 % immunohistochemistry PCR ) irrespective HER2 status . 6 . No evidence metastatic disease . 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0/1 . 8 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) least 50 % 9 . Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential within 14 day prior treatment initiation ( premenopausal le 12 month amenorrhea postmenopause , undergone surgical sterilization ) . 10 . For woman childbearing potential sexually active , agreement use highly effective nonhormonal form contraception two effective form nonhormonal contraception least 6 month posttreatment . 11 . Patients must affiliate social security system 1 . Patients noncandidate upfront breast surgery candidate neoadjuvant chemotherapy hormonotherapy . 2 . Patients receive another concomitant anticancer treatment like chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine treatment , radiotherapy currently diagnose tumor . 3 . Known hypersensibility abemaciclib component . 4 . Difficulty swallow oral medication . 5 . Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease would put patient high risk treatmentrelated complication . 6 . Patients whose general clinical condition consider postpone surgery . 7 . Inadequate organ function , evidence follow laboratory result : Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3 Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL Total bilirubin great 1,5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( unless patient document Gilbert 's syndrome ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST [ SGOT ] ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT [ SGPT ] ) &gt; 3 x ULN Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL and/or clearance creatinine &lt; 50mL/min ( calculate CockcroftGault method ) 8 . Patients serious preexist medical condition , judgment investigator , would preclude participation study ( example , history major surgical resection involve stomach small bowel , preexist Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) . 9 . Patients personal history within last 12 month follow condition : syncope cardiovascular etiology , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , sudden cardiac arrest . 10 . Patients assess investigator unable unwilling comply requirement protocol . 11 . Pregnant breastfeeding patient</criteria>
