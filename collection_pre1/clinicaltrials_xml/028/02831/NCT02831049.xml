	<brief_summary>Background : Sights , sound , smell associate alcohol tempt people drink . The connection encounter cue want drink might reduce behavioral technique , like give cue certain time , certain circumstance . Objective : To see visual imagery behavioral technique reduce alcohol crave drinking . Eligibility : Healthy people age 21 65 mildly concerned drink habit past 3 month : Women : More 3 drink single day 7 drink per week Men : More 4 drink single day 14 drink per week Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test , alcohol breath test , hepatitis test , alcohol drug use questionnaire . Participants get smartphone carry throughout study . They use report drinking , mood , activity daily . The phone GPS record location throughout day . There 6 study visit 4 week . Visits last 4 hour , final visit last 7 hour . Visits include follow : Not drink alcohol use illicit over-the-counter drug least 24 hour visit Providing urine breath sample . Exposure various cue . Participants reaction monitor measure heart rate , blood pressure , skin temperature . Drinking alcohol soft drink . For visit alcohol , transportation visit provide . About month last visit , participant call ask drinking craving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate alcohol memory retrieval-extinction , novel behavioral procedure reduction crave drinking , problem drinker . Study population : We collect evaluable data 75 participant . Participants evaluable complete geographical momentary assessment ( GMA , describe ) . All participant adult alcohol drinker ( men : &gt; 14 drinks/week &gt; 4 drinks/day ; woman : &gt; 7 drinks/week &gt; 3 drinks/day ) whose drinking score hazardous Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test . Participants seek treatment alcohol-use disorder , physiologically dependent alcohol , drug use disorder . Design : A randomized study three group . Participants use smartphones provide geotagged report alcohol crave drink daily life ( GMA report ) , , series laboratory session . During session , participant drink alcoholic beverage ( individualized produce 0.06 g/dL blood alcohol content ) soft drink . Participants repeatedly present alcohol- soft-drink-associated cue without drinking . These memory retrieval extinction portion , respectively , memory retrieval-extinction . Previous study suggest procedure robustly reduce Pavlovian association cue response crave . The mechanism seem involve memory reconsolidation , freshly retrieve association ( e.g. , drink cue consumption - pleasant effect ) become vulnerable disruption extinction . Three group test : ( 1 ) alcohol retrieval / alcohol extinction compare ( 2 ) soft-drink retrieval / alcohol extinction ( 3 ) alcohol retrieval / soft-drink extinction . Before retrieval-extinction , participant test alcohol crave cue-induced physiological response laboratory session . Retrieval-extinction follow 1 week follow-up GMA reporting , telephone contact 30 day thereafter . Outcome parameter : The co-primary outcome measure : self-reported alcohol crave laboratory session retrieval-extinction , GMA report alcohol crave drinking . Daily-life response important version retrieval-extinction use , retrieval induce drinking alcohol , rather alcohol cue alone , may especially likely effect generalize laboratory daily life . Secondary outcome measure : ( 1 ) self-reported alcohol crave drink 30-day follow-up , ( 2 ) physiological reactivity session , ( 3 ) urine biomarkers alcohol consumption .</detailed_description>
