	<brief_summary>Background . For century causal link influenza cardiovascular disease suspect . It conceivable influenza may precipitate plaque rupture , increase cytokine central role plaque destabilization trigger coagulation cascade . Accordingly , registry study , case control study small randomized trial , underpowered clinical endpoint , demonstrate risk acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) increase follow respiratory infection risk stroke AMI patient establish cardiovascular disease seem reduce follow influenza vaccination . In May 2015 Cochrane review conclude influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular mortality cardiovascular event bias inconsistent result prior study require higher-quality evidence confirm finding . High cost little commercial interest conduct randomize trial influenza vaccine cardiovascular disease stand way . Objective . The objective document whether influenza vaccination protect cardiovascular event death AMI . Methods . Population : 4400 patient ST-elevation ( STEMI ) non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) randomize 1:1 blinded fashion use RRCT design follow via registry two telephone call . Intervention : Influenza vaccination . Control : Placebo ( saline ) . Outcome : The primary endpoint composite death , myocardial infarction stent thrombosis till 1 year patient STEMI/NSTEMI undergo coronary angiography/PCI . Patients include study Sweden 's 8 university hospital , 3 university hospital Denmark , 1 Finland , 1 Iceland 1 specialized heart center Norway . Secondary endpoint time all-cause death , time stent thrombosis , time revascularization , time myocardial infarction , time stroke time rehospitalization heart failure till 1 year , 2 year , 3 year 5 year . Furthermore , extensive health-economic analysis conduct . The trial approve ethical committee system ( Dnr 2014/264 ) Medical Products Agency ( EudraCTnr -2014-001354-42 ) Sweden . Perspectives . If clinical benefit demonstrate prospective trial influenza vaccination may become important novel in-hospital therapy patient cardiovascular disease accompany direct indirect societal gain profound .

	<detailed_description>Name investigational treatment : Influenza vaccine ( Vaxigrip , Sanofi Pasteur MSD ) . Title study : Influenza vaccination After Myocardial Infarction ( IAMI trial ) . Study center : Up 35 invasive center Sweden , Denmark , Finland Iceland . Planned study period : 2016 - 2019 October 1 March 1 ( influenza season ) . Long-term follow 2023 via registry . Phase development . Phase IV . Objectives : In multicenter , prospective , randomized registry-based control clinical trial base SCAAR SWEDEHEART platforms national registry participate country compare influenza vaccination placebo reduce future major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event patient myocardial infarction . Methodology : Following informed consent patient randomize 1:1 fashion influenza vaccination placebo 24 hour prior coronary angiography/PCI ( NSTEMI patient ) 72 hour follow coronary angiography/PCI ( NSTEMI STEMI patient ) . Number subject : 4 400 Primary endpoint : Time all-cause death , new myocardial infarction stent thrombosis ( first occur ) till 1 year . These data obtain national health registry . Secondary endpoint - Time all-cause death till 1 year - Time cardiovascular death till 1 year - Time stent thrombosis till 1 year - Time revascularization till 1 year - Time myocardial infarction till 1 year - Time cardiovascular death , new myocardial infarction stent thrombosis ( first occur ) till 1 year - Time stroke till 1 year - Time hospitalization heart failure . - Length hospital stay report SWEDEHEART Follow telephone registry information : The follow endpoint perform use SCAAR registry . Seven day vaccination patient request return postage pay standard questionnaire ass adverse event occur . Follow primary secondary endpoint also perform telephone contact patient first degree relative nurse phone call 350±10 day . Quality assurance . It compulsory register patient undergo PCI participate country . All registry data routinely validate participate country part routine registry function . Sites monitor accord specific study monitoring plan . Data check part registry use us predefined rule range consistency data field registry . Source data verification part routine registry maintenance compare data medical record . Overall agreement registry data medical record &gt; 95 % . Standard Operating Procedures : Before start clinical trial center telephone/web-based start meeting presentation study , study procedure documentation . The first visit site center include patient study . During study period , monitor regular contact participate department ensure trial conduct compliance protocol applicable regulatory requirement . The monitor also provide information support investigator ( ) . The number monitoring visit limit unless specific problem occur main part monitor centralized regular check data quality database . Moreover log sign informed consent AE form fax sponsor follow-up . The monitor review source document verification consistency study data record CRF accord risk base monitoring . Investigators responsible personnel must available monitoring visit , possible audit inspection devote sufficient time process . Patient recruitment status continuous ( updated every 24 hour weekday ) available trial website . Reporting adverse event : Registration adverse event start inform consent treatment study medication give continue patient leaf hospital coronary angiography/PCI procedure minimum 7 day follow influenza vaccination . The time limit use treatment group . The patient inform contact investigator study nurse adverse event occur timeframe . Seven day vaccination patient request return postage pay standard questionnaire ass adverse event occur . An AE untoward medical occurrence patient clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavourable unintended sign , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal ( investigational ) product , whether related medicinal investigational product . Medical occurrence symptom exist disease , represent exacerbation disease , PCI procedure define AE 's clinical trial . Also elective hospitalisation pre-treatment condition AE 's expect reaction vaccination , limited , redness , swell , pain , fever chill . AEs report also define study endpoint . An IEC evaluate safety 1000 patient . Serious Adverse Events - SAE : A serious adverse event ( SAE ) untoward medical occurrence effect dose : result death , life-threatening , require hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation , result persistent significant disability incapacity , congenital anomaly birth effect , important medical event . Hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient hospitalisation disease represent exacerbation disease coronary angiography/PCI procedure well event non-related study medication report SAE . Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction - SUSAR : All serious adverse event ( SAE ) must evaluate unexpected drug relate . The definition unexpected adverse reaction adverse event , document report earlier . If responsible investigator judge SAE drug relate unexpected must promptly report sponsor , responsible reporting SUSARs Regulatory Authorities Ethics Committee . Whether reaction expect assessed SPC . Assessment severity . For adverse event , serious well non-serious , investigator must make assessment severity . Relationship classify accord follow definition . - Mild : Awareness sign symptom , easily tolerate cause interference daily activity . - Moderate : Discomfort enough cause interference daily activity . - Severe : Inability perform normal daily activity . Relationship study drug . The investigator judge whether , his/her opinion , adverse event associate study treatment . Relationship classify accord follow definition : Probable : An adverse event , might due use drug . The relationship time suggestive ( e.g . confirm dechallenge ) . An alternative explanation less likely , e.g . concomitant drug ( ) , concomitant disease ( ) . Possible : An adverse event , might due use drug . An alternative explanation , e.g . concomitant drug ( ) , concomitant disease ( ) , inconclusive . The relationship time reasonable ; therefore , causal relationship exclude . Unlikely : An adverse event alternative explanation likely , e.g. , concomitant drug ( ) , concomitant disease ( ) , relationship time suggest causal relationship unlikely . Reporting procedure Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events : Only adverse event serious adverse event consider sign symptom expect related STEMI NSTEMI know side effect study drug report study . Events define endpoint study ( e.g . all-cause death , new myocardial infarction stent thrombosis ) report adverse event . This mean clinical sign symptom , report patient observed investigator , opinion investigator unexpected relation actual diagnosis , report 7 day post vaccination . SUSAR report procedure : If responsible investigator judge SAE drug-related unexpected event must report sponsor within one work day . The documentation CIOMS form ( http : //www.cioms.ch/index.php/cioms-form-i ) . The sponsor responsible reporting SUSAR regulatory authority ethic committee . The sponsor also responsible information involve investigator study . - A SUSAR result death judge life threatening must report regulatory authority ethic committee within 7 day sponsor notified event . A full report send authority within 15 day . - A SUSAR result death life threatening report regulatory authority ethic committee within 15 day sponsor notified event . A full report send authority soon possible . Annual report : A safety report , include assessment overall safety report SUSARs submit yearly Regulatory Authorities request Ethics Committee . Sample size : The combined 1-year primary endpoint all-cause death , new AMI stent thrombosis estimate 10.0 % ( expect survival probability 0.9 ) individual randomize placebo . With 5 % two-sided significance level investigator calculate 386 event would need 80 % statistical power detect 25 % reduction primary endpoint influenza vaccination group , correspond hazard ratio 0.75 . With estimation 2186 patient need per study group , power calculation utilized STATA release 11 ( College Station , TX , USA ) . In order control dropouts cross one group ( negligible TASTE ) , 4400 patient include . Statistical analysis : The result analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . Differences group time-to-event endpoint assess log-rank test . For primary endpoint , patient censor 1 year ; analysis time point handle similar way . Survival probability display calculate use Kaplan-Meier methodology . Hazard ratio ( HR ) 95 % confidence interval study group calculate use Cox proportional hazard model , violation proportional hazard assumption time-dependent HR calculate adjustment make stratification variable , center STEMI/NSTEMI . Differences study group assess unpaired t-tests original scale log scale appropriate . Ordinal variable assess chi-2 test trend Mann-Whitney U test Pearson 's chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use test difference proportion . Two-sided statistical significance level 5 % use estimate present 95 % confidence interval . Subgroup analyse first foremost carry primary endpoint component . All subgroup analyse event data perform use proportional hazard model factor treatment , subgroup , treatment-subgroup interaction , present within-group hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval interaction p-value . The primary subgroup analyse focus STEMI NSTEMI population effect intervention three influenza season , purpose evaluate effect subgroup . Interim Safety Analysis : A maximum 3 month follow inclusion first 1000 patient independent endpoint committee ( IEC ) monitor study endpoint . Variables assess all-cause death , new myocardial infarction stent thrombosis . Premature termination study mandate event one treatment strategy show statistically significance 0.001 alpha level composite time all-cause death , new myocardial infarction stent thrombosis .</detailed_description>
