	<detailed_description>This Phase II trial determine efficacy safety situ gene therapy stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) use window opportunity treatment nivolumab patient metastatic squamous non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . In situ gene therapy consist adenovirus-mediated expression herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( ADV/HSV-tk ) plus Valacyclovir therapy . Male female patient age ≥18 year histologically cytologically confirm metastatic squamous non-squamous NSCLC whose disease progress platinum-based chemotherapy immune checkpoint therapy eligible participate study . Patients EGFR ALK genomic tumor aberration eligible disease progression FDA-approved therapy aberration . ADV/HSV-tk ( 5 x 1011 viral particle ) 2-mL total volume inject intratumorally day 0 study . Valacyclovir orally administer dose 2 g three time daily 14 day . Valacyclovir treatment administer 24 hour gene vector injection day 1 day 15 study . SBRT 30 gray ( Gy ; 6 Gy X 5 fraction ) administer 2 week day 2 day 16 study . Nivolumab ( 240 mg ) administer intravenously 60 minute every 2 week start day 17 study continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary endpoint objective response rate ( ORR ) ADV/HSV-tk + Valacyclovir therapy combination SBRT use window opportunity treatment nivolumab patient metastatic squamous non-squamous NSCLC . Both RECIST 1.1 modify immune-related response criterion ( irRC ; derive RECIST 1.1 ) use assess treatment response . Secondary endpoint include ) duration response ( DoR ) ; b ) overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate ; c ) safety toxicity ( toxicity define treatment-related death ≥ grade 3 toxicity exclude alopecia constitutional symptom assess NCI CTCAE v4.03 ) ; ) immune-mediated antitumor activity ( assessed RECIST 1.1 modify irRC ) ADV/HSV-tk plus Valacyclovir therapy combination SBRT use window opportunity treatment nivolumab .</detailed_description>
