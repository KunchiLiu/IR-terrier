	<brief_summary>The purpose study implement Anesthesiology Control Tower ( ACT ) . This pilot study employ exist information technology infrastructure Barnes Jewish Hospital create remote monitor alert system operate room . Similar `` telemedicine '' method employ critical care , ACT support operate room clinician adhere best-practice principle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthesiology Control Tower</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study logically build previous work utilize already establish infrastructure resource intra-operative electronic medical record AlertWatch® alert system . In conceptualize pilot study , well large follow-up trial focus clinical outcome , mindful challenge put forward investigator National Institutes Health , seek support low-cost , pragmatic , patient-centered randomize control trials.91 Specifically relation ACTFAST , ( 1 ) highly develop , specialize IT infrastructure limit investment require embark study ; ( 2 ) study conduct entirely within context routine clinical care , negate need dedicate trial-related visit ; ( 3 ) access registry granular data complication patient-reported outcome obviates need new costly infrastructure track patient outcome ; ( 4 ) inclusion large number broadly representative patient study highly efficient waiver inform consent.91 The design pilot proof-of-concept study randomize clinical effectiveness trial . It include 6-month pre-intervention period time ACT staff alert send . This allow training controller , refinement alert , optimization process obtain filter information diverse electronic source . Following period , trial begin run 12 month . On daily basis study period ( weekdays 7am 5pm ) , operate room Barnes-Jewish Hospital ( BJH ) eligible randomization , occur use computer-generated assignment . Anesthesiology team ORs allocate experimental arm receive additional support ACT form control-tower alert complement AlertWatch® system . The outcomes interest pilot study usability usefulness ACT , clinician adherence recommendation monitoring , documentation therapeutic intervention , key physiologic variable temperature blood pressure . We also document patient outcomes include duration postoperative hospital stay , incidence postoperative morbidity ( myocardial infarction , surgical site infection ) , functional recovery , postoperative quality life . Data endpoint inform design subsequent trial focus clinically relevant outcome , logically follow current pilot randomize trial . All alert include study choose follow proven best intraoperative management practice line national metric quality safety .</detailed_description>
