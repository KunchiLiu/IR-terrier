	<brief_summary>The aim study know difference protein profile ( multi-analyte profile ) PH1 patient , idiopathic hypercalciuria ( IH ) patient PH1 patient 'siblings . Idiopathic hypercalciuria less severe kidney disease PH1 , also lead formation kidney stone . The aim identify pattern discriminate marker associate primary hyperoxaluria type 1 ( PH1 ) significantly improve clinical diagnosis prognosis .</brief_summary>
