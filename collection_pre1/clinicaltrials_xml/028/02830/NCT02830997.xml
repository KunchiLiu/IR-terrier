	<brief_summary>In total knee replacement operation , surgeon us techniques instrument guide operation ensure part prosthesis ( artificial knee surface ) place correct position . There many technique surgeon use achieve accuracy operation . This study compare Principal Investigator 's present precision-guided technique instrumentation method newly develop technique use computer-based stereotactic guidance system . The purpose study : 1 . ) learn whether use different guidance system result difference accuracy placement prosthesis ; 2 . ) compare length time take experienced joint replacement specialist complete operation use different guidance system ; 3 . ) learn whether advantage either system term function recovery patient first year surgery ; , 4 . ) provide manufacturer stereotactic guidance system feedback technical ease use workflow ease system may use train education purpose and/or plan refinement system . The study enroll 150 patient Athens Orthopedic Clinic 2 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Knee Arthroplasty Guidance Systems Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open-label study aim enroll 75 participant conventional guidance arm follow 75 participant stereotactic guidance arm , sequence . Detailed observational data collect surgical procedure , participate patient evaluate prescribed interval ( pre-operatively , 2,4,6 , 12 month post-operatively ) use survey instrument , clinical indicator , routine radiologic outcome . Radiologic outcome assess use standard x-ray obtained course normal care patient undergo total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . A subset first 30 patient enrol treatment arm , addition , ask voluntarily undergo compute tomography ( CT ) scan low extremity ( hip , knee , ankle joint ) 8-12 week surgery measure 3-dimensional accuracy prosthesis placement limb alignment . Data collection include : 1 . Demographic background information ( age , sex , height , weight , social ( occupation/employment ) , major comorbidity ( broadly classify ) , smoke ) 2 . Patient report outcome measure ( Veteran 's Rand 12-item Health Survey ; 2011 Knee Society Score ) 3 . Physical Examination ( knee range motion , knee stability ) 4 . Details surgical operation 5 . Operating room workflow detail , include skin-to-skin surgical time 6 . Post-operative disposition 7 . Radiologic outcomes 1 . Routine pre- post-operative radiograph review limb alignment evidence prosthesis fixation 2 . Post-operative CT scan ( hip , knee , ankle ) use evaluate accuracy placement TKA prosthesis ( femoral tibial component ) accuracy limb alignment coronal , sagittal , axial plane . The value measure post-operative CT scan compare final intra-operative plan ; lack difference two constitute 'accuracy ' . 8 . Adverse event</detailed_description>
