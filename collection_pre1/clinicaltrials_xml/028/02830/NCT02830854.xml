	<brief_summary>A variety non-pharmacological intervention use management Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) similar cognitive disorder elderly , yet therapeutic modality demonstrate conclusive positive result term effectiveness . Although still unknown trigger AD , recent study show AD associate brain energy depletion , oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction . Since supplemental molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) support cell energy production act highly bioavailable mitochondria-related antioxidant , may provide ideal agent facilitate treatment perhaps prevention AD similar cognitive disorder elderly . The overall hypothesis evaluate project administration H2 positively affect patient-reported outcome clinical biomarkers men woman suffer AD .</brief_summary>
