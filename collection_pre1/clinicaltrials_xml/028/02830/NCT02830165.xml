	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) treat patient prostate cancer likely come back spread ( high-risk ) undergoing surgery . SBRT type external radiation therapy use special equipment position patient precisely deliver radiation tumor body . Delivering radiotherapy prostatectomy SBRT convenient , conformal , may spare normal tissue well deliver radiotherapy prostatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) prostate cancer patient high risk recurrence prostatectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety acute toxicity SBRT follow prostatectomy . This base Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 patient report quality life ( Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [ EPIC ] International Prostate Symptom Score [ IPSS ] questionnaire ) . II . Correlative biomarker molecular analysis use primary tumor specimen serial blood draw treatment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3 fraction SBRT 1-2 week , 2-4 week prior radical prostatectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
