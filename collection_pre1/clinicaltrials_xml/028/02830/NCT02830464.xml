	<detailed_description>In recent year advance diagnosis/ therapy patient acute coronary syndrome heart failure / renal insufficiency patient could make . However , disease still associate increased mortality rate . The disease affect time heart kidney contribute deterioration course disease . An acute chronic functional impairment organ , e.g . heart , connect another functional impairment , kidney . In past , different score risk prognosis assessment introduce measure many different diagnostic parameter E.g . age , pre-existing condition , kidney function , heart function , laboratory value . The score use risk assessment treatment . For determine prognosis heart kidney-failure patient , biomarkers analyze . Biomarkers blood urine provide early information specific course disease call prognostic biomarkers . In study , prognostically relevant biomarkers cardiovascular / renal insufficiency clinically evaluate , improve course assessment disease gain new insight typical course congestive heart failure . This prerequisite allow patient appropriate treatment soon possible . An important role heart vascular disease award Fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF ) 23 . The height FGF23 blood plasma link risk cardiovascular event occur begin dialysis patient . FGF23 go hand hand development heart failure hospitalization result heart failure . The clinical utility biomarkers examine relation establish risk score calculate clinical parameter , determine whether biomarker bone-heart-kidney axis extend forecast evaluation patient .</detailed_description>
