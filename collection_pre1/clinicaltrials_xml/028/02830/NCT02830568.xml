	<brief_summary>The main objective multicentre study conduct evaluation cost-efficiency various technique kidney take regard quality life kidney living donor . It allow compare three technique take ( open donor nephrectomy , cœliosurgery pure `` hand-assisted `` cœliosurgery assisted robot ) determine respective advantage quality life , medico-economic consequence cost-efficiency approach point view society . The evaluation concern donor receiver follow three month take . The open donor nephrectomy technique reference compare two others .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Context : The efficient treatment terminal chronic renal insufficiency renal transplantation , spite realization 2000 transplant year France , wait list increase every year important way . The decrease offer transplant deathly donor lead numerous country develop renal transplant alive donor . This type transplantation represent 2007 8,1 % transplant France ( report ABM 2007 ) , deficit renal transplant new law bioethics increase donation ( represent 70 % renal transplantation certain centre North America Northern Europe ) . Although French urology top laparoscopic technique , classic surgical take lombotomie stay reference technique , practise 58 % centre , patient consequence term pain , duration hospitalization , convalescence possible side effect . The development take cœliosurgery , mini-invasive technique , allow increase number wish organ donation centre develop . It however difficult technical gesture , require important experience . This technique inconvenience painful scar subject complication section know pubic `` Pfannenstiel '' use take pure cœliosurgery . The surgical robot Da Vinci ( Intuitive Surgical , Sunnyvale , California ) , 3D mink , joint instrument inside body , reduction movement , best ergonomics , improve precision cœlioscopic gesture , sharply upper cost . The CHU Nancy pioneer Europe develop technique 2002 , encourage result series 80 patient . Only retrospective study compare quality life technique , spite major financial impact ( 10 year dialysis represent 100 K€ ; price robot 1700 K€ ) important difference quality life accord various surgical approach , prospective comparative medico-economic study realize . In France , hospital bear load expense concern donor , include daily allowance medical certificate , shorten hospitalization convalescence donor well result improve transplantation receiver kidney living donor would allow fast amortization expensive technology . Main objective : To compare cost efficiency three technique take kidney live donor . Main assessment criterion : The quality life donor test generic measuring instrument EUROQOL SF-36 ( D-1 ( day renal transplantation ) , D4 ( 4 day ) D90 ( 3 month ) SF-36 D-1 D90 ) . It realize donor 's preoperative ( D-1 ) , postoperative ( D4 ) visit follow-up 3 month ( D90 ) . It also collect receiver 's preoperative ( D-1 ) , postoperative immediate ( D4 ) visit follow-up 3 month ( D90 ) . The combination cost estimate allow build marginal cost-efficiency ratio . Secondary objective envisage : - The evaluation quality life receiver measure instrument becomes generic EUROQOL SF-36 D-1 , D4 ( Euroqol ) D90 . - The comparison comfort surgeon physical psychic investment index card ( form ) specific evaluation ( Borg NASA-TLX ) . - The comparison coelio-surgical technique : pure coelioscopy , coelioscopy `` hand-assisted `` coelioscopy assist robot concern quality life marginal cost-efficiency ratio .</detailed_description>
