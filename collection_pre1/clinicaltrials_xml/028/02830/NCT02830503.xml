	<brief_summary>Project summary Rationale Many NICU 's replace feed tube week rarely order avoid disturb infant . The researcher discover high concentration potentially pathogenic bacteria yield resident nasogastric feeding tube , even within one day use ( data , manuscript submit ) . Preterm infant vulnerable colonization gut , development dysbiosis might lead necrotizing enterocolitis . The researcher speculate replace resident feed tube every day thereby decrease amount potentially pathogenic bacteria give infant via feed tube lead few bacteria present upper part gastrointestinal tract infant hence reduce competition probiotic colonization . Objectives The investigator plan conduct intervention study premature infant receive probiotic ( &lt; 32 week gestation ) feed tube replace every day intervention group week ( standard practice ) control group . The main outcome bacterial concentration stomach one week life . Methods The study prospective , randomize control trial preterm infant . Infants randomized intervention group tube replace every day control group follow normal practice department . The intervention last one week . The infant follow discharge . The investigator plan include 11 infant group . Primary outcome Concentration bacteria gastric aspirate day seven .</brief_summary>
