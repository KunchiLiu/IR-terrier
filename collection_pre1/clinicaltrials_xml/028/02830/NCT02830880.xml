	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass use anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid ( FACBC fluciclovine ) PET scan useful determine participant respond chemotherapy treatment . Investigators enroll participant whose cancer treat hormone therapy cancer respond treatment ( Castration -resistant ) , therefore start chemotherapy . Investigators enroll thirty ( 30 ) participant study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FACBC Prostate Therapy Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal investigation examine therapeutic monitoring chemotherapy castrate resistant prostate carcinoma anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC prostate carcinoma determine anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC amino acid image serve accurate efficient image biomarker . Investigators perform baseline anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT whole body . All participant also undergo conventional stag include 99mTc MDP bone scan cat scan ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) abdomen pelvis standard care enrol institution . This study interfere standard patient evaluation delay therapy . All 30 participant receive chemotherapy every 3 week 4 cycle . Participants undergo repeat anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT 1 4 cycle also repeat conventional imaging include bone scan CT MR abdomen pelvis 4 cycle . At end study , study team record response ( lack thereof ) anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT correlate response response per standard clinical criterion include bone scan uptake skeletal lesion , CT MR soft tissue skeletal lesion , PSA progression regression , clinical parameter decline performance status .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Biopsy proven primary recurrent castration resistant prostate carcinoma skeletal and/or nodal involvement currently undergo systemic chemotherapy commence therapy docetaxel/prednisone .
