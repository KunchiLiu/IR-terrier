	<detailed_description>This study prospective multi-centre observational single-arm clinical trial , aim investigate efficacy safety low profile visualize intraluminal support ( LVIS ) stent combine coil treatment rupture intracranial saccular aneurysm . As protocol , clinical follow-up 30 day ( ±7 day ) procedure , DSA MRA follow-up 6 month ( ±30 day ) procedure , clinical follow-up 1 year ( ±30 day ) procedure conduct patient . The primary end-points include major adverse event ( cerebral infarct death ) 30 day post-procedure , complete occlusion rate 6 month ( 180±30d ) follow-up , modify Rankin Score ( mRS ) 1 year follow-up . The secondary end-points immediate technical success ( successful device placement ) rate , immediate complete occlusion rate , recurrence rate 6 month ( 180±30d ) follow-up in-stent stenosis obliteration rate 6 month ( 180±30d ) follow-up . Duration study 2 year .</detailed_description>
