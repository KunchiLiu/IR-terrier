	<brief_summary>In proposal , aim examine shear wave elastography ( SWE ) measurement diseased native kidney correlate grade fibrosis use histological sample . The overall goal propose study address follow specific aim . Specific aim : To determine whether difference exist elasticity measurement native kidney without fibrosis . Hypothesis : Kidneys high grade fibrosis demonstrate high measure tissue elasticity stiffness compare kidney zero fibrosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project prospective cross-sectional study correlate native kidney shear wave elastography ( SWE ) measurements histology . Briefly , patient refer native kidney biopsy undergo SWE shear wave velocity ( SWV ) correlate degree fibrosis determine pathologist . A list patient recently underwent native kidney biopsy obtain pathology department weekly basis . Patients contact participate study consent follow visit nephrologist . After biopsy , patient schedule come renal ultrasound SWE . SWE examination conduct use ultrasound machine equip Philips Epiq ARFI Shear wave ElastPQ C1-5 mHz transducer . Shear wave velocity obtain estimate tissue elasticity ( Young 's modulus ) calculate . All measurement perform one two qualified radiology physician blind clinical pathological data . We allow period 90 day obtain image biopsy ; otherwise patient longer eligible participate . The primary outcome measure study determine whether tissue elasticity determine SWE assess kidney fibrosis . Linear regression analysis perform describe relation extent fibrosis parenchymal stiffness .</detailed_description>
