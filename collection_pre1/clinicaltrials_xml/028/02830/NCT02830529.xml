	<detailed_description>Hypertension ( HTN ) , know `` silent killer '' affect 1 3 adult United States cost $ 50 billion annually disproportionately affect African Americans ( AA ) . A significant proportion AA population live blood pressure consistent clinical criterion prehypertension hypertension many untreated undiagnosed . AAs prehypertension 35 % great risk progress hypertension white . Salt sensitivity , chronic stress stress relate racism/discrimination , self-efficacy , motivation , activation among factor associate pre-HTN AAs . The prevention progression prehypertension hypertension sodium reduction , stress management , physical activity part evidence base treatment , efficacy self-management intervention pre-HTN AAs lacking . The Dietary Approach Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) gold standard prevention treatment hypertension yet many study , report AAs less likely adhere DASH intervention compare white . The barrier self-management report AAs include stress , include perceive stress related racism/discrimination ; perceive lack control get hypertension future ; limit social support ; low motivation change behavior . AAs perceive stress cause hypertension less likely engage self-management behavior . If brain prolong state stress , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA ) activity compromise leading allostatic load ( wear tear chronic stress body ) increase accumulation abdominal fat , atrophy nerve cell hippocampus , hypertension . The intervention use large hypertension trial adequately address chronic stress effect racism/discrimination cognitive mediator ( self-efficacy , motivation , activation , decision making , health information ) hinder practice self-management behavior AAs . In addition , none DASH intervention study AAs include mindfulness , strategy widely apply across clinical population manage obesity , BP , depression motivate patient brain level , task level . Self-management intervention activate relevant area brain need optimize adaption health behavior . There two distinctively anti-correlated network brain : analytic brain processing emotional brain processing influence self-management behavior . The analytic brain processing center , locate prefrontal parietal area brain activate attention demand task ( skill , knowledge , self-monitoring ) . In contrast , emotional brain processing center locate posterior cingulate medial prefrontal cortex activate wakeful rest ( emotion management , social cognition , self-awareness ) . As activation analytic brain processing center increase , emotional brain processing center decrease . Thus , comprehensive approach engage analytic brain processing emotional brain processing hypothesize help AAs improve motivation , activation self-efficacy , garner necessary social support succeed management prehypertension . The investigator test effect promise new self-management intervention AAs , Mindfulness Attitude Deliver Dietary Approach Stop Hypertension ( MAD DASH ) depart conventional intervention address prehypertension combine two self-management intervention ( Mindfulness DASH ) group set . 2 ) Purpose , specific aim and/or hypotheses The purpose gather pilot data inform future study use follow aim : 1 . Determine whether difference sodium intake , blood pressure ( BP ) , health relate quality quality life ( HRQoL ) , among receive analytic component ( DASH diet education ) , emotional component ( MAD-DASH mindfulness plus DASH diet education ) compare receive usual care ( DASH pamphlet ) . 2 . Examine whether patient activation , motivation , decision-making , self-efficacy , health information mediate relationship MAD DASH mindfulness intervention self-management behavior ( diet , self-monitoring , physical activity ) . 3 . Determine social support , demographic ( gender ) , allostatic load moderate proximal ( diet , physical activity ) distal ( BP , sodium , HRQoL ) outcomes . 4 . Explore difference brain activation ( fMRI ) cortical network , HPA Axis/stress function ( cortisol ) among MAD DASH intervention , DASH education intervention , usual care . 3 ) Background significance The investigator hypothesize MAD DASH intervention improve participant 's neural brain processing diet education self-monitoring emotional brain processing level meditation , deep breathing , monitor emotion promote prehypertension self-management behavior ( diet , self-monitoring , managing emotion , physical activity ) . The investigator hypothesize behavior lead reduction blood pressure mediate HPA axis function stress response ( systematic inflammatory effect ) , cognitive mediator ( self-efficacy , decision-making , motivation , health information , activation ) , contextual factor ( social support , demographic , allostatic load ) modify effect intervention proximal ( increased fruit vegetable , decrease sodium intake , increase physical activity ) distal ( BP , sodium , HRQoL , cost ) outcomes . These mechanism hypothesize lead performance self-management behavior , turn expect lead subsequent reduction sodium intake , BP , improve HRQoL The MAD DASH intervention likely improve health behavior due integration Mindfulness practice non-judgmental self-awareness emotion , sensation , cognition . Mindfulness believe affect self-management self-regulation response , acceptance emotion ( e.g. , stress , anxiety , depression ) , self-control emotion -- -that interfere person 's ability practice health behavior management . Improvements HRQoL also associate mindfulness practice . The MAD DASH eight-session intervention include body scan exercise ( lie sit eye close deliberately focus sensation within body ) , sit meditation , yoga exercise along self-management education ( self-monitoring sodium intake , physical activity ) incorporate strategy reduce sodium intake , manage emotion , increase physical activity . There may direct benefit subject , however participation may provide data provide insight way African Americans reduce blood pressure improve overall health . Understanding biological psychosocial factor contribute blood pressure control African American adult timely population expect grow 9.9 million 2050 substantial disparity health outcome exist population . Findings study potential elucidate factor contribute disparity health outcome African Americans good characterization neurobiological mechanism self-management prehypertension .</detailed_description>
