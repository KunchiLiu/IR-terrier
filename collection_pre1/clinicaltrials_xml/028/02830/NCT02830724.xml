	<brief_summary>Background : In new cancer therapy , researcher take person blood , select certain white blood cell grow lab , change gene cell use virus . The cell give back person . This call gene transfer . For study , researcher modify person white blood cell anti-CD70 . Objectives : To see gene transfer anti-CD70 cell safely shrink tumor certain treatment safe . Eligibility : Adults age 18 old diagnose cancer CD70-expressing cancer . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , scan , test . They may admit hospital . Leukapheresis perform . For , blood remove needle arm . A machine separate white blood cell . The rest blood return needle arm . Eligible participant intravenous catheter place upper chest . Over several day , get chemotherapy drug anti-CD70 cell . They recover hospital . Participants take antibiotic 6 month treatment . They repeat leukapheresis . Participants visit clinic every 1-3 month first year treatment , every 6 month second year , determine physician . Follow-up visit take 1-2 day . At visit , participant lab test , image study , physical exam . Throughout study , blood take participant many test determine size extent tumor treatment impact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administering Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes Transduced With CD70-Binding Chimeric Antigen Receptor People With CD70 Expressing Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We generate chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) engage CD70 use natural ligand CD27 , bind moiety . Transducing PBL CAR convey MHC-independent recognition CD70 express target cell , include renal cell carcinoma cancer . - In co-cultures CD70+ target cell , anti-hCD70 CAR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN-gamma high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - To determine safety administer PBL transduce anti-hCD70 CAR concert preparative lymphodepletion high dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ; aldesleukin ) . - Determine anti-hCD70 CAR-transduced PBL mediate regression CD70 express tumor . Eligibility : Patients CD70 express tumor 18 year age old must : -Measurable metastatic disease progress standard therapy Patients may : -Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure cell retroviral vector supernatant contain replication-incompetent virus encode anti-hCD70 CAR . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - On day 0 patient receive PBL transduce anti-hCD70 CAR begin high dose aldesleukin . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct approximately 4-6 week treatment . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design , two separate cohort Phase II component : 1 ) renal cell carcinoma 2 ) non-renal cell cancer ( solid tumor )</detailed_description>
