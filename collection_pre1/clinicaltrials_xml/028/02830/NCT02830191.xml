	<brief_summary>Ciclosporin A ( CsA ) immunosuppressive drug use organ tissue transplantation ( kidney , heart , liver , bone marrow ... ) prevent rejection , different autoimmune inflammatory disease . A therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) require CsA treatment . It justify narrow therapeutic range efficiency nephrotoxicity , large intra- interindividual pharmacokinetic variability . TDM CsA conventionally perform determine residual concentration , sometimes concentration 2 hour administration . TDM CsA currently perform venous sample ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . Dried blood spot ( DBS ) sampling could particularly interesting alternative conventional blood sampling . With DBS , capillary blood obtain finger prick patient , blood drop obtain deposited filter paper , store room temperature send laboratory mail . This sample method several advantage : require small blood volume , less invasive conventional venous sampling , sample perform patient home day consultation , result analysis available clinician day consultation , allow dose adjustment quickly . Several study publish recent year use DBS sample method , various drug antimalarial , antiepileptic , antiretrovirals , metformin , benzodiazepine , immunosuppressant . Only one clinical validation study TDM CsA use DBS method publish Wilhelm et al . ( 2013 ) population 38 patient receive allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient . The result show excellent correlation concentration determine two sample method . The investigator propose observational study University Hospital Caen clinical validation DBS sample TDM CsA kidney transplantation , data publish . During nephrology consultation , patient , venous finger prick blood sample simultaneously collect . CsA assay perform liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) two sample method . A specific LC-MS/MS assay method apply DBS sample develop validate study ( DBS/LC-MS/MS ) . Correlation result obtain two sample method evaluate , least 100 sample . Patients answer questionnaire ass pain comfort DBS sampling , feasibility self-sampling home method . The aim clinical validation study DBS sample establishment systematic TDM CsA renal transplant patient DBS sample University Hospital Caen .</brief_summary>
