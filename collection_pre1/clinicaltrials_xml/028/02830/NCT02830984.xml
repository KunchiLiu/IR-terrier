	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) become one important technique treatment bile duct stone . A number study conduct use large-balloon dilation ( LBD ) adequate EST extract large bile duct stone . In study , author suggest EST plus LBD might lower risk post procedure pancreatitis ( PEP ) direct balloon dilation toward bile duct rather pancreatic duct . It report EPBD follow insertion nasobiliary drainage catheter prevent PEP . However , still unclear nasobiliary drainage endoscopic sphincterotomy plus large-balloon dilation prevent postoperative pancreatitis treat large bile duct stones.The investigator therefore design prospective randomize trial determine whether nasobiliary drainage prevent PEP endoscopic sphincterotomy plus LBD treatment large bile duct stone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients enrol confirmed presence CBD stone use magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography . Patients large bile duct stone randomly assign EST+LBD+ENBD group EST+LBD group . A descriptive analysis perform primary endpoint , contain frequency number percentage patient . A two proportion equality test conduct explore whether incidence rate different . Descriptive statistic include number ( N ) , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum , produce continuous variable . Frequency table number ( N ) percentage subject produce categorical variable .</detailed_description>
