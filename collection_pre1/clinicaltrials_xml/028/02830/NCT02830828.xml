	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common condition result impaired hand function . In case CTS `` pinch grip '' force thumb index finger become unnecessarily high prevent object slip pick . HYPOTHESES The propose study investigate follow hypothesis regard CTS . As object pick , investigator suspect several point grip force different patient different severity CTS , i.e . grip may deteriorate CTS get bad . The investigator also suspect grip force affect depend weight object , i.e . patient CTS may struggle object certain weight . Patients CTS sweat less , may affect grip . The investigator suspect pinch grip CTS patient disproportionately alter frictional property object moistness skin . The investigator suspect patient CTS less able adapt sudden change object 's weight . The investigator wish examine affected surgical treatment CTS . METHODS The investigator include patient symptomatic , idiopathic CTS , age 18 80 year . The investigator ' centre recruit CTS patient attend National Health Service ( NHS ) outpatient appointment follow nerve conduction study . An equal number healthy participant recruit comparison purpose . At aforementioned appointment , patient undertake pinch grip force test use device test point . Patients normal care surgeon , may include operation treatment CTS . Therefore patient invite back grip test operation . No aspect study prevent patient receive normal National Health Service ( NHS ) care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RESEARCH QUESTIONS This study ask important question CTS build previous research field . The research question : - How precision pinch grip force affect CTS throughout activity pick replace object , range CTS severity , especially severe CTS ? - How precision pinch grip force affect patient CTS pick object different weight ? - How precision pinch grip force affect patient CTS frictional property skin-device interface alter ? - How precision pinch grip force CTS alter sudden increase downward load force ? - How parameter change surgical treatment CTS ? CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AND STUDY JUSTIFICATION Answers question inform understanding precision pinch grip force control , CTS . Patients CTS drop thing , investigator feel impaired hand function CTS related poor grip control . Previous author recognise pinch grip force affect CTS ( Hsu et al . 2013 ) . The investigator intend extend work show aspect force control alter CTS throughout action pick object , correlate CTS severity . This allow u use different reading take pinch grip test ass CTS severity . This also reveal heavy object may great adverse affect grip control CTS patient . If successful , pinch grip testing could form table-top test CTS nerve injury evaluation may allow good patient selection surgery . The investigator also account skin hydration , sweat impaired CTS , rarely account previous work . ( This since abandon mid-study ) . When examine friction impact precision pinch force CTS , investigator may inform understanding investigator could design occupational aid median nerve problem . Investigating patient CTS compensate object hold suddenly change weight , help u understand reflex co-ordinated hand , may help u work towards rehabilitate patient nerve injury affect upper limb . We currently good evidence patient surgery CTS whether surgery restores hand function lose patient suffer CTS . Investigating happen surgery , may show u best time operate patient , patient prioritise whether surgery actually improve pinch force control post-operatively . DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH PROPOSAL This research proposal formulate experience senior hand surgeon multidisciplinary team professional regional hand surgery centre active research base ( The Birmingham Hand Centre , University Hospitals Birmingham , UK ) . Consultation carry attached University Birmingham 's Department School Psychology . A lead collaborator department 's Professor Human Movement . RECRUITMENT Patients CTS routinely refer investigator ' centre assessment treatment CTS . They would normally refer centre GP , receive appointment letter attend hospital . They would evaluate clinically nerve conduction test . This may hand surgery consultant member hand team . Patients may receive date surgery would follow necessary . The Principle Investigator one Local Collaborator consultant hand surgeon would receive referral see patient clinic . Recruitment occur one follow point ; 1 . At point patient refer Principle Investigator , patient offer chance participate appointment letter contain Participant Information Sheet . This assessed upon presentation clinic . 2 . Some patient list surgery without see investigator ' research clinic , suitable inclusion therefore `` missed '' . The investigator intend recruit patient already list operation carpal tunnel syndrome day surgery . The Chief Investigator approach patient day operation seek permission carry pinch-grip testing surgery . Patients would receive Patient Information Sheet Chief Investigator , would consent study inclusion test within Ambulatory Care Unit hospital whilst wait operation . There would alteration normal care certainly delay operation . Recruitment affect normal NHS ( National Health Service ) care way . Very limited data ( ) collect point patient attend normal NHS ( National Health Service ) appointment . If choose take part , attend normal NHS ( National Health Service ) appointment without need undergo grip test . No therapeutic promise make Participant Information Sheet . Recruitment `` control '' participant ; Healthy , age-gender match control invited staff student body University Birmingham take part pinch grip test exercise alone act control group . The investigator request response university member age 18-80 . Potential participant invite take part email circulate staff student . Interested participant respond email receive full Participant Information Sheet Controls . This specify information collect comprise age , gender , hand dominance grip test data ( GP Contact detail store anonymously case incidental finding discover warrant action ) . They invite attend University Hospital Birmingham grip strength test perform undergo test accord protocol outline patient group . This point consent take Chief Investigator appropriate member research team . The sample size determine power analysis run begin study , expect comprise 50 patient . This recruitment process note mid-study fail recruit age-matched control . As alternative , patient match , contralateral hand free symptom CTS . No formal power analysis take place , minimally important clinical difference know . INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion criterion : Patients symptomatic , idiopathic CTS ( affirmed clinical examination NCS ) present clinic Aged 18 80 year In contrast study investigator would include patient ; Previous upper limb injury Previous upper limb surgery CTS intervention ( e.g . steroid injection ) Diabetes mellitus Any upper limb nerve neuropathy upper limb neurology Upper limb musculoskeletal degenerative disease ( osteoarthritis ) Thyroid disease , ( Zhang et al . 2011 ) . This create pragmatic study design , generalisable wider population clinical practice . Exclusion Criteria : Central neurological psychiatric disease Visual impairment impairment would interfere patient 's ability perform study test Pregnant patient . ( Criteria base prior research ( Zhang et al . 2011 ) ) . CONSENT The consent form suggest Medical Reseach Council ( MRC ) Health Research Authority Participant Information Sheet follow guideline . Both distributed appointment letter send patient . Informed consent participate confirm original clinic appointment . Members hand team consent patient operation almost daily , fully familiar assessment capacity understand ethical principle underpin informed consent . Consent obtain Chief Investigator ( CI ) . The study include assessment child vulnerable adult RISKS , BURDENS AND BENEFITS Patients inform risks benefit anticipate use Participant Information Sheet . The investigator guarantee treatment benefit yet know result show . However , patient help u understand important problem affect many similar patient . These patient may benefit research future . With consent , lay summary circulate patient control completion study inform result work . They consent informed participation sheet . Their preferred contact detail store separately index spreadsheet trust computer system link clinical data . The intent carry pinch grip force test CTS patient . This add time patient ask stay clinic 30 minute . They fully inform ask whether wish participate , prior invite take part precision pinch grip test . This affect access assessment treatment CTS . The intent test precision pinch grip test custom build device develop University Birmingham . This device base already use Zhang Hsu et al , anticipate pose risk harm patient . The investigator know side effect may grip test . Patients may find hand little tired test ; however last long severe . The investigator think risk injury pose patient grip device small . The investigate team trialed device healthy volunteer member research team prior use study . The investigator think risk ; include limited psychological physical harm , pose study fall outside risk inherent normal clinical care . Confidentiality breech extremely unlikely , information store NHS ( National Health Service ) trust computer , however investigator acknowledge risk . Only clinicians involve patient care researcher within study team access patient ' clinical detail . Patients consent allow non-clinical member research team ( university staff ) access essential information study ; however information keep absolute minimum . For example , researcher performs `` pinch-grip '' test , fair assume researcher become aware patient diagnosis CTS . Patients consent . The burden patient request attend three subsequent follow-up appointment acknowledge , however benefit patient may feel contribute study encourage attend . The study sponsor ( UHB ) update throughout , special emphasis place draw attention risk burden emerge start study . The risk convey Participant Information Sheet . CONFIDENTIALITY Confidentiality Principles Principle 1 : The purpose obtain patient information outline . Principle 2 3 : Person-identifiable data collect . Participants identify UHB Patient Number . Principle 4 : Access person-identifiable data limit member treat clinical team . If non-clinical collaborator perform precision pinch-grip test clinic , access patient-identifiable clinical detail , test afterwards analysis . Principle 5 6 : All clinical team member aware commitment confidentiality law . The investigator anticipate principle need breach order prevent serious patient harm . If however , situation arises , discuss Chief Principle Investigators , relevant authority contact advice action take whilst take step safely inform affected patient early possible . CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Principle Chief Investigators involve clinical evaluation CTS patient appointment . Special care take ensure patient aware study participation affect normal care way . Care take avoid form coercion . The Principle Chief Investigators may also perform surgical treatment appropriate patient , however separate study affect care way . Effort make ensure patient coerced return follow-up grip testing operation . Patients may wish attend extra follow-up appointment . At end study , patient discharge back care GP , refer back concern arise ( normal practice ) . Participants aware know result grip test , intent publish full paper within twelve month . HUMAN TISSUE Non- applicable OTHER ETHICAL ISSUES The intent carry pinch grip force test CTS patient . This add time patient ask stay clinic . They fully inform ask whether wish participate , prior invite take part precision pinch grip test . This affect access assessment treatment CTS . The intent test precision pinch grip test custom build device develop University Birmingham . This device base already use Zhang Hsu et al , anticipate pose risk harm patient . OTHER LEGAL ISSUES As device custom-built University Birmingham , intellectual property right address department develop device , view draw confidentiality agreement , although pre-requisite commence trial . OTHER MANAGEMENT ISSUES This intention set-up National Health Service ( NHS ) clinic back-to-back CTS patient , clinical assessment , follow nerve conduction study , follow pinch grip assessment . This require logistic planning , however co-ordinated internally UHB make process clear patient recruit study via Participant Information Sheet .</detailed_description>
