	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab palliative radiation therapy work treat patient esophagus , stomach , gastroesophageal junction cancer spread part body . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Palliative radiation therapy , external beam radiation therapy , use high energy beam treat symptom cause tumor . Giving pembrolizumab together palliative radiation therapy may work well treat patient esophagus , stomach , gastroesophageal junction cancer spread part body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Palliative Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophagus , Stomach , Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . To establish combination pembrolizumab traditional external beam multifractionated radiation therapy ( RT ) primary tumor single target metastatic site patient metastatic gastric , esophageal , and/or gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancer lead increase tumor infiltrate cytotoxic T-cells circulate cytotoxic T cell reduction immunosuppressive regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) metastatic site . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish combination pembrolizumab RT feasible patient population evaluate toxicity per National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( ver . ) 4.03 . II . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 immune relate ( ir ) RECIST treatment population correlate tumor T-cell response . III . To evaluate progression-free ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) treatment population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure change whole genome serum micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) signature protocol therapy correlate tumor/immune/stromal cell miRNA expression profile determine deep sequencing . OUTLINE : INITIAL TREATMENT : Patients undergo palliative external beam RT daily . On day 1 , patient undergo first RT fraction receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute . Courses repeat every 3 week 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SECOND PHASE : Patients achieve complete response , stop study treatment , experience radiographic disease progression may eligible second phase discretion investigator cancer treatment administer since last dose pembrolizumab trial eligibility safety parameter meet . Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 week 1 year , every 9 12 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
