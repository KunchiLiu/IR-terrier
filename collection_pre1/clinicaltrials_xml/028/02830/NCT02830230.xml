	<brief_summary>There strong causal association persist genital tract infection Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) gradual progression infection cervical ( mouth uterus ) cancer.The robust study India show single round HPV DNA screen test significantly reduce cervical cancer mortality . The finding encourage since demonstrates simple reliable HPV DNA test available low income country potential accept primary screening test future . The cross-sectional study develop country year 1999-2004 focused determine test characteristic HPV Hybrid Capture 2 test ( HC2 ) determine CIN2 high grade lesion , report test sensitivity 90 % 100 % mean 95 % . Similarly cross-sectional study develop country 1993 2003 focus test characteristic HPV DNA Hybrid capture 2 ( HC2 ) test determine CIN2 high grade lesion show sensitivity range 50 % 91 % average sensitivity 79 % .Among develop country cross-sectional study India evaluate test report sensitivity 68.2 % . There statistical significant difference ( p value = 0.003 ) sensitivity HPV DNA HC2 test develop develop country determine CIN2+ Lesions difference specificity . A study conduct Chinese woman detect prevalence HPV genotype among woman mucopurulent cervicitis , healthy woman woman Invasive cancer , author report 10 % high failure rate extract HPV DNA case mucopurulent cervicitis compare two group . So study explore presence untreated co-infections STIs/RTIs ( Sexually transmit infections/Reproductive tract infection ) result cervical inflammation somewhere interfere low sensitivity HC2 test due presence blood excess mucus associate condition lead low sensitivity test context Indian Scenario .</brief_summary>

The participant ready participate explain detail purpose study Doctor.All woman enrol woman shall follow 7-14 day . Day 1.Cervical swab ectocervix endocervix shall collect . Additional vaginal swab Will take lateral vaginal wall posterior fornix woman enrol study.The swab evenly spread glass slide heat fix . The slide put slide box transport Microbiology Department Gram stain Gonococcal , Non-Gonococcal infection , Bacterial Vaginosis , Candida . Next , cervical cell HPV DNA test collect . The woman diagnose clinical cervicitis receive treatment spot advise use use barrier contraception 15 days.No treat give woman enrol arm i.e woman without clinical lab STIs . Day7-14- All woman enrol study shall follow 7-14 day . Women undergo per-speculum examination clinical sign cervicitis cervicovaginitis reassess document . A repeat cervical swab vaginal swab shall collect send gram staining mention organism . A repeat , cervical cell HPV DNA test collect . Women positive HPV DNA STIs follow visit shall counsel referred evaluation treatment appropriate hospital .</detailed_description>
