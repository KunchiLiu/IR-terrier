	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate nature change oral gut bacterial resistance profile antibiotic therapy surgical procedure two group . The intervention group receive course amoxicillin analgesic surgical extraction bacterial sample take saliva , tongue coating stool sample four appointment period six month . This compare control group receive analgesic surgical extraction . An examination development sustainability antibiotic resistance oral gut microbiome healthy cohort follow 6 month , surgical extraction impact teeth . Change proportion antibiotic resistant bacterial component study use Metagenomic DNA sequence quantification resistant gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial Design This prospective , longitudinal , observational , cohort study investigate young adult undergoing surgical extraction wisdom tooth without antibiotic post-operatively . The prescription antibiotic base clinical judgment base case complexity , trauma length procedure . No randomization perform . Four observational time point undertaken collect 3 bacterial sample ( tongue coating , saliva stool sample : baseline , 1 week , 1 month 6 month . To survey extent persistence range bacterial resistance gene within oral gut microbiota cohort systemically healthy young adult surgical extraction third molar receive receive amoxicillin . Hypothesis It anticipate single course amoxicillin ( 250 mg three time daily five day ) prescribe surgical tooth extraction , impacted third molar , alters short-term long-term antibiotic resistance profile cause significant shift composition oral gut resistome healthy cohort . From analysis bacterial resistance , comparison baseline data time give insight impact increase antibacterial resistance . Understanding help pave way determine guideline rational prescription antibiotic dental surgical clinical procedure form basis antibiotic stewardship well determine potential risk benefit awareness prescribe antibiotic . This baseline data followed-up longer timeframe examine persistence resistance gene time later study . It expect significant number patient student cohort HKU make later recall straightforward . Patients ask keep record log antibiotic consumption initial study may inform late research . Subjects schedule surgical extraction give write consent part study recruit . An experienced clinical operator specialist maxillofacial surgery training ( ML Co-A ) responsible perform clinical treatment . Prescription antibiotic base case complexity , difficulty operative surgical procedure time take . Therefore patient randomize base obtain 10 patient group . Three set sample ( Saliva , tongue dorsum scraping stool sample ) collect follow four time point . The subject ask refrain brushing teeth night sample collection perform similarly ask use dental mouthwash . Apart collection time point , subject ask maintain 'normal ' , routine oral hygiene procedure duration study . After collection baseline sample surgical extraction third molar tooth perform . The subject give post extraction instruction analgesic pain relief subject Amoxicillin require antibiotic . Compliance check ask patient check tablet wrapper strip amoxicillin recall appointment . The subject ask refrain use mouth rinse six month study period ( already ) toothpaste without antibacterial content provide use . Tongue coating , saliva stool sample DNA extraction collect specified time point describe . Baseline- antibiotic group On day surgery Baseline- antibiotic On day surgery 1 week 1 week 1 month 6 month Samples oral cavity take morning least two hour meal . Subjects advise collect stool sample within 24 hour schedule appointment . A sterile micro brush use collect tongue coating The tongue coat sample take stroke surface tongue three time back front side one half anterior two-thirds tongue time point sampling . After sample collection , tip micro brush cut place inside Eppendorf vial . The sample store -800C DNA extraction perform . For saliva sample , subject ask spit sterile container immediately transfer ice store - 800C . Collection stool sample perform base guideline stool sample collection give human microbiome project ( 16 ) . DNA extraction perform sample use DNA extraction kit provide ( Qiagen , USA ) . Metagenomic shotgun sequence For metagenomic sequencing extract genomic DNA physically shear average fragment size 250 bp . The fragmented gDNA sequence bi-directionally ( 100 bp direction ) lane Illumina HighSeq . Quality filter perform Trimmomatic ( 17 ) , pair unpaired forward read combine read 10 % ambiguous base remove . Next , read screen human sequence Best Match Tagger v3.101 ( 18 ) , human read duplicate read remove . Relative abundance resistant gene The blaTEM primer use describe Kim et al ( 22 ) . Primers analyze presence erm ( G ) , erm ( B ) erm ( F ) resistance gene describe Jansonn et al ( 23 ) . Primers Tet ( M ) Tet ( W ) gene describe Diaz-Torez et al ( 24 ) . 16S universal primer use relative quantification standard . 12 The relative gene abundance assess use real time PCR . Conventional PCR reaction use generate gene-specific amplicons use template DNA standard qPCR . Amplicons purify use gel/PCR extraction kit QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen , USA ) quantify fluorometrically use Quant-iTTM PicoGreenÂ® dsDNA Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) . The number DNA molecule calculate base size mass amplicons . Tenfold serial dilution amplicons prepare use follow procedure Yu et al . ( 25 ) . Selection Withdrawal Subjects Patients recruit wait list Prince Philip Dental Hospital , The University Hong Kong clinically screen wish impacted wisdom teeth remove . Sample size We would present outcome log 10 scale compare day 0 community DNA extract fecal sample . From previous study ( 15 ) , anticipate standard deviation 1.25 unit . By sample size determination use software G*Power version 3.1.9.2 ( Franz Faul , Universitat Kiel , Germany ) , would need least 8 per group power 0.8 detect 1.25 unit difference 0.05 significance level . Therefore , research , collect total sample size 16 ( 8 per group ) initial stage . Treatment Subjects This prospective , longitudinal , observational , cohort study investigate young adult undergoing surgical extraction wisdom tooth without antibiotic post-operatively . Antibiotics analgesic give post- operatively . Amoxicillin Intra orally , three time daily 250 mg 5 day Analgesics - Arcoxia 120mg three day Paracetamol 500 mg QID PRN 3 day Paracetamol 1 g Plus 16 mg Codeine Phosphate . The prescription antibiotic base clinical judgment base case complexity , trauma length procedure . No 14 randomization perform . Four observational time point undertaken collect 3 bacterial sample ( tongue coating , mouth rinse stool sample : baseline , 1 week , 1 month 6 month . If patient take additional antibiotic review period six month , ask inform investigator . Compliance check ask patient check tablet wrapper strip amoxicillin recall appointment . Assessment Efficacy The study look efficacy new drug . The treatment procedure carry accord conventional treatment protocol . Assessment Safety The study look safety new drug . The treatment procedure carry accord conventional treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
