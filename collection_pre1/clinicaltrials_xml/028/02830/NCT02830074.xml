To end , study randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare efficacy combine sleep PAP adherence program , call `` BEST '' program ( Best practice PAP + patient Education +ongoing Support Training ) . The central aim proposal therefore test efficacy two PAP adherence program . The study two main aim . First , investigator aim test efficacy educational program improve adherence PAP therapy first 6 month use ( data available subject 12 month ) . Second , investigator evaluate impact program sleep quality three key area function : general functioning ( use measure specific SCI/D patient ) , respiratory functioning ( via spirometry ) quality life ( assessed measure appropriate use patient limited mobility ) 3-month intervention period . The investigator also explore whether intervention effective subgroup patient others . The propose work relevant VA 's patient care mission , address critical need patient suffer disparity access high quality care disability . The investigator anticipate investigator ' work yield significant new knowledge improve health quality life Veterans living SCI/D .</detailed_description>
