	<brief_title>Reliability Functional Measures Hemodialysis Patient .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer End Stage Renal Disease commonly involve haemodialysis treatment , common treatment stage . Haemodialysis substitute renal function associate several alteration lead decrease functional capacity health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) . Many study show functional capacity , physical activity level HRQoL significantly bad healthy sedentary age - match counterpart . It unknown low physical activity , uraemia anaemia responsible decreased functional capacity cohort . Physical performance test frequently use assess haemodialysis patient since feasible low-cost evaluation . The purpose present study quantify functional capacity change -6 month period group haemodialysis patient . Additionally investigator pretend calculate value absolute relative reliability yet report ( Short Physical Performance Battery , one-leg balance Timed Up go ) .</detailed_description>
