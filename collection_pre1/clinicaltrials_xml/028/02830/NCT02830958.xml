	<brief_summary>The hip commonly perform operation . It prosthetic joint replacement surgery whose effectiveness depend quality architectural mechanical reconstruction artificial hip , integrity balance periarticular musculature . To achieve dual purpose , two element essential : access hip best meet musculature able restore balance , adequate prosthesis . Despite move towards surgery less invasive hip replacement procedure cause tissue damage . This result nociceptive neuropathic pain , become chronic 30 % case . Several study show risk factor chronic post-surgical pain . They relate patient also surgery . Puolakka study correlate chronic pain post-surgical acute pain follow surgery surgical patient total knee arthroplasty . Indeed , post-operative acute severe pain multiplies 10 risk develop chronic pain . It thus advantageous reduce postoperative pain , localize mainly trochanteric region , decrease risk develop chronic post surgical pain . Now medical comunity know post-operative bruising tissue damage partly responsible pain . The Kinesiotaping use adhesive elastic cotton tape color invent Dr. Kase 1970s It water resistant retain property 5 day . It characteristic cause elevation epidermis thereby reduce pressure mechanoreceptors dermis . This would effect reduce nociceptive stimulus . Its designer also claim would beneficial effect lymphatic venous circulation . According Kase Kinesiotaping cause uprising epidermis decreasing pressure dermis promote lymphatic drainage mechanical action movement . The lymphatic system responsible capture waste venous blood ( catabolites , plasma protein ) thus promote absorption edema . In study , Donec highlight significant decrease pain high absorption postoperative edema Kinésiotape® group control group surgical patient total knee arthroplasty . The Curetape® band use orthopedic surgery department since 2010 current care . Consequently , seem interesting evaluate effect Curetape® surgical patient total hip replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Kinesio Taping Effect Pain Edema Patients Who Underwent Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective / Secondary : To evaluate effect application Kinésiotape® patient undergo total hip replacement pain change immediate postoperative edema . Methodology : - STUDY This prospective randomized study routine care , placebo perform hospital group Paris Saint Joseph , 75014 . - Randomization : Given weakness literature subject Investigators opt trial randomization 2 group make patient . The patient list balance randomly alternate block . orthopedic ward staff physiotherapist inform first schedule avoid bias care patient . An array randomization create independent person study . This randomly assign patient group use Microsoft Excel . - Time study The projected duration patient recruitment adjust rhythm inclusion reach 30 patient per group ( follow normal distribution ) 6 month recruitment event observe strong effect tape pain . Acquisition data : - Data collect Clinical data categorization patient identify ( age , height ( ) Weight ( kg ) , sex ) . Investigators evaluate postoperative edema measure perimeter thigh . [ 6 ] The perimeter measure millimeter 1/3 2/3 distance lateral condyle femur - great trochanter . The landmark find palpation mark replication , data measure use 150 cm graduate Bohin® tape mm perform bedside student intern physiotherapy . To quantify postoperative pain , Investigators use numerical scale present questionnaire patient . Investigators note last day patient hospitalization amount analgesic receive daily , hang postoperative hospitalization . - Supports : data collection form .</detailed_description>
