	<brief_summary>This research study study Surefire Infusion System ( `` Surefire '' ) increase delivery chemotherapeutic agent deliver trans-arterially intermediate stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( `` HCC '' ) ( Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) class B ; locally advance , liver restrict disease patient . The name study intervention involve study : -Trans-arterial chemoembolization ( `` TACE '' ) without utilization Surefire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Surefire Infusion Device Tumor Response Regional Intra-arterial Therapy Primary Liver Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study randomize Pilot study , first time investigator examine use Surefire device improve tumor perfusion . Specifically , study compare TACE without use Surefire device Investigators research determine Surefire Infusion System improve tumor response liver-directed intra-arterial chemotherapy compare traditional microcatheter . Surefire Food Drug Administration-approved valve-like device block backflow within artery also generate increased pressure tumor feeder vessel infusion . During study , participant receive medication dose way would deliver liver standard care procedure , either regular microcatheter ( standard care procedure ) Surefire Infusion System ( modify microcatheter ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unresectable HCC , define image criterion cytohistologic assessment . TACE prefer method treatment determine multidisciplinary Brigham Women 's Hospital / Dana Farber Cancer Institute ( BWH/DFCI ) Liver Tumor Board . Intermediate stage HCC ( BCLC class B ) , eligible curative treatment , ChildPugh A B. Additionally , tumor involve great 50 % entire liver . Prior systemic chemotherapy allowable . Age 1875 year . The pediatrics population include disease low prevalence population . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great least 12 month . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥60,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) /Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit , creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . No previous regional treatment ( include surgery , radiation liverdirected arterial ablative therapy ) . Main tumor size &gt; 1 cm The effect study arm develop human fetus unknown , however different control group . In addition , significant radiation deliver procedure , positive pregnancy test exclude patient study addition exclude receive standard therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants prior local regional therapy include radiation therapy , transarterial therapy , ablative therapy . A hypovascular tumor ( defined tumor part less contrastenhanced nontumorous liver parenchyma arterial phase compute tomography scan ) . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Evidence hepatic decompensation include esophageal gastric variceal bleed hepatic encephalopathy . Severe underlying cardiac renal disease . Color Doppler ultrasonography show portal vein tumor thrombosis complete main portal vein obstruction without cavernous transformation ; obstructive jaundice . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive patient NOT exclude study . Patients undergo MRI evaluation/examination ( eg . pacemaker metallic implant ) History allergic reaction attribute agent use study ( i.e . doxorubicin , epirubicin , MRI contrast agent iodinate contrast agent ) . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy utilize within chemoembolic agent teratogenic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemoembolic agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat chemoembolic agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study well radiation associate angiographic procedure .</criteria>
