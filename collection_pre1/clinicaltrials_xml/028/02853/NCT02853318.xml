	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study combination pembrolizumab , bevacizumab , low dose oral cyclophosphamide treat patient recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way boost immune system find , recognize kill tumor cell well block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth nutrition . Drugs use chemotherapy , low dose oral cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , well enhance body 's immune response cancer cell . As three drug show improve immune response cancer cell give pembrolizumab , bevacizumab , cyclophosphamide together may work well treat patient recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate improvement progression-free survival patient treat anti-programmed cell death 1 ( anti-PD1 ) pembrolizumab combination intravenous ( IV ) bevacizumab oral metronomic cyclophosphamide compare patient treat second line chemotherapeutic agent . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pilot data clinical response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion immune relate response criterion ( irRECIST ) . II . To obtain data change tumor microenvironment prior subsequent therapy , screen potential biomarkers predict clinical benefit . III . To determine safety tolerability treatment combination study population . IV . To evaluate overall survival patient treat anti-PD1 pembrolizumab combination IV bevacizumab oral metronomic cyclophosphamide . V. To assess impact combination anti-PD1 pembrolizumab , IV bevacizumab oral metronomic cyclophosphamide anti-tumor immune response ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 month ( 17 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without evidence disease progression may continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 12 week 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
