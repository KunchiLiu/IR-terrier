	<brief_summary>Mounting amount evidence suggest non-invasive stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) maybe safe effective treatment modality Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . However large variability magnitude clinical outcome report likely related current lack knowledge ideal side stimulation ( left v right ) limit precision target brain circuit need obtain optimal treatment response . In protocol investigator : 1 ) generate individualize treatment plan base individual 's functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) meta-analytical base connectivity analysis guide delivery adjunct , imaging-based &amp; robotically deliver rTMS active duty military ( ADM ) subject PTSD participate intensive program providing integrate evidence-based psychotherapy pharmacological management ( Treatment Usual ( TAU ) ) . 2 ) To use clinician rating self-report PTSD symptom scale , well indicator clinical change , determine whether compare TAU , addition adjunct rTMS improve clinical outcome . 3 ) To conduct neuroimaging-based assessment aim measure rTMS effect network connectivity ADM receive treatment PTSD potential correlation connectivity change clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled , 20 consecutive day trial adjunct rTMS right DLPFC ADM PTSD receive TAU Laurel Ridge Treatment Center ( LRTC ; San Antonio , TX ) . Methods : Consenting ADM receive TAU PTSD LRTC randomize receive 20 consecutive day adjunct rTMS accord one two treatment arm : Arm 1 TAU plus rTMS right DLPFC Arm 2 TAU plus sham rTMS . At UTHSCSA 's Research Imaging Institute ( RII ) , brain image neurocognitive assessment conduct , rTMS treatment plan generate base ( pre-treatment ) anatomical functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) guide optimal robotic positioning TMS coil accurately target subject DLPFC . Initial diagnostic interview weekly clinical follow ups conduct LRTC research clinician blind subject ' research group . A comparison baseline brain connectivity measurement subject ' neuroimaging follow ups conduct treatment Week 3 conduct identify network connectivity change potentially associate treatment response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female Englishspeaking patient ( either activeduty military civilian ) receive treatment LRTC age 1865 year ; 2 . Patients must diagnosis PTSD confirm ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale ( CAPS5 ) screening , 3 . Subjects must minimum PTSD Symptom Checklist DSMV ( PCL5 ) symptom severity rating 35 . 4 . Treatment resistance ( i.e . meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSMV ) CAPS criterion PTSD ) despite complete least one adequate trial Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ) SerotoninNorepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor ( SNRI ) FDArecommended dose least 68 week . 5 . Subjects SSRIs antidepressant , hypnotic medication include modulators GammaAminobutryic Acid ( GABA ) A receptor function , trazodone , atypical neuroleptic prazosin may enter study deem stable dose medication . 1 . Subjects diagnostic history bipolar disorder , schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder currently exhibit psychotic feature confirm MiniInternational Psychiatric Interview ( MINI ) . 2 . Serious , active suicidal risk assess evaluate psychiatrist . Serious active suicidal risk determine imminent risk suicide reflect patient plan intent end life . History suicidality exclusion participation protocol long evaluate psychiatrist determines absence serious active suicidal risk mean keep patient safe . 3 . Substance use disorder 3 month prior screen ; except Mild Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder accord DSMV criterion . 4 . Any history sign serious medical neurological illness include seizure disorder . Except seizure , subject clinical abnormality may include study clinician considers illness introduce additional risk interfere study procedure . 5 . History traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) loss consciousness 20 minute determine Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen ( TBI Screening Tool ) . 6 . Positive urine pregnancy test screening . 7 . Any history sign metal object ( e.g . surgical clip , cardiac pacemaker , metal implant , etc . ) body time screen . MRI risks person foreign body implant body .</criteria>
