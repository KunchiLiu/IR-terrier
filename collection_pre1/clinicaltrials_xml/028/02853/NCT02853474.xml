	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , open-label multicenter phase III study aim estimate survival benefit Early Palliative Care ( EPC ) combine standard oncology care include first-line chemotherapy ( experimental arm ) standard oncology care ( standard arm ) , patient metastatic upper gastrointestinal cancer ( gastric cancer , pancreatic cancer , biliary tract cancer ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Palliative Care Patients With Metastatic Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers Treated With First-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical oncology aim increase patient 's survival , even metastatic stage , addition disease-related treatment-related symptom . However , provide palliative care ( PC ) include symptoms management , nutritional support , psychosocial support , well assistance end-of-life preference , may important survival issue improve quality life set . In France , PC traditionally offer late , end-life stage , although World Health Organization recommend provide PC earlier possible course disease , order increase quality life . Decades ago , PC service initiate France order provide medical alternative use questionable medical practice regard end life period : abandonment , euthanasia , inappropriate aggressive therapy . According French society palliative care , PC approach aim provide active care , holistic approach , person serious , progressive terminal illness . The objective PC relieve pain distressing symptom , also take account psychological , social spiritual suffering . PC offer interdisciplinary support system help patient relatives . As mentioned previously , PC France ( also US ) usually offer late , end-life stage . Actually , PC access become Right guaranteed Law , patient family 1999 . This context explain even nowadays , PC often mean `` end life `` lay-man general public also caregiver , doctor . The last World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommendation far less restrictive 1996 French recommendation , stated PC offer earlier possible course disease , order increase quality life , positively influence course illness . The World Health Organization recommendation add PC applicable early course illness , conjunction therapy intend prolong life , chemotherapy radiation therapy , include investigation need well understand manage distress clinical complication . In recent randomized study , 151 patient newly diagnose metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer randomize receive either early PC ( EPC ) combine standard oncologic care standard oncologic care alone . It hypothesize patient , receive EPC , compare patient receive standard oncologic care , would better quality life ( primary endpoint ) . The first visit PC service set within first 12 week , median number visit EPC group 4 . In study , author refer recommendation National Consensus Project Quality Palliative Care . Among patient metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer , EPC lead significant improvement quality life . In addition , EPC lead significant improvement mood , well overall survival ( median survival , 11.6 vs. 8.9 month ; HR=0.60 , p = 0.02 ) ) , despite less aggressive end-of-life care . Following publication American study , American Society Clinical Oncology recommend nowadays `` combined standard oncology care PC consider earlier course illness patient metastatic cancer…. '' . However , clear gap exists ( France ) recommendation current practice . In addition , consensus early PC integrate oncologic service , even though underpowered small randomize trial report recently insignificant good survival favor early versus delay ( 3 month later ) initiation PC . The result study describe , although formally restrict field metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer , modify perception many oncologist objective PC . However , additional clinical study do consider EPC additional survival input advance malignancy . The median survival metastatic upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancer pancreatic cancer , gastric cancer , biliary tract cancer exceed 10-11 month , poor report metastatic lung cancer . Standard care metastatic set upper GI cancer describe ad hoc French guideline , i.e . : `` Thésaurus National de Cancérologie Digestive '' . Briefly , standard care metastatic pancreatic cancer first-line setting lie combination fluorouracil , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ( FOLFIRINOX regimen ) patient without cholestasis good performance status , gemcitabine monotherapy . In metastatic biliary tract cancer , standard care lie gemcitabine-based regimen ( gemcitabine monotherapy , gemcitabine plus cisplatin , gemcitabine plus fluorouracil ) . Besides HER2 positive metastatic gastric/gastrooesophageal patient present much good prognosis , treat trastuzumab-based regimen , patient metastatic gastric/gastrooesophageal HER2 negative patient ( IHC + IHC ++ negative fish/sish ) poor prognosis , similar survival rate patient upper GI malignancy . In set , several regimen may offer patient , follow : Folfox , EOX/ECX , Folfiri , LV5FU2-cisplatin , Capecitabine-platinum salt docetaxel-based regimen ... ) . Several experimental treatment ( antiangiogenics , meet inhibitor , modulators immune check point , etc ... ) currently test metastatic gastric/gastrooesophageal cancer , treatment restrict patient good health condition accept participate clinical trial , none trial yet produce meaningful survival benefit first-line setting . To summarize , therapeutic advance set metastatic upper GI cancer infrequent , often modest . Providing extra survival benefit patient EPC , may contribute deeply modify practice care oncology France .</detailed_description>
