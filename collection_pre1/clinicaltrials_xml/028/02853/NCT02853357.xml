	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine short-term effect thoracic spine thrust manipulation participant low back pain . Participants study randomize receive either low thoracic spinal manipulation standard set exercise , sham manipulation standard set exercise . It hypothesize thoracic manipulation combine core strengthening exercise positive short term improvement pain function patient LBP compare sham manipulation combine core strengthening exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim use randomize controlled trial design investigate effect thoracic spinal manipulation conjunction core strengthening exercise compare sham manipulation core strengthening exercise patient low back pain . Core strengthening exercise show improve pain functional status patient non-specific low back pain compare conventional exercise . However , strong evidence suggest exercise alone adequate management low back pain . Spinal manipulation demonstrate promising result management low back pain , unclear whether target location manipulation important . It hypothesize thoracic manipulation combine core strengthening exercise positive short term improvement pain function patient LBP compare sham manipulation combine core strengthening exercise base theory regional interdependence . The specific aim study follow : 1 . To determine effect thoracic spine manipulation core strengthen exercise function individual low back pain , specifically measure change Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire ( MODQ ) . 2 . To determine participant 's perception improvement follow thoracic spine manipulation core exercise , measure global rating change ( GROC ) , compare sham manipulation . 3 . To determine effect thoracic spine manipulation core exercise fear avoidance , measure fear-avoidance belief questionnaire ( FABQ ) , individual low back pain . 4 . To determine effect thoracic spine manipulation core exercise pain use numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) . The ability demonstrate effectiveness manipulation target thoracic spine conjunction core exercise could provide clinician simple , effective treatment strategy low back pain minimal injury risk , potential improve pain function , ultimately decrease healthcare cost associate low back pain . The effect treatment disability , fear-avoidance , pain analyze use 2x2 repeated measure multivariate analysis variance ( MANCOVA ) , pre/post-test measure time two factor duration symptom serve covariate . An independent test use determine difference Global Rating Change group follow , number need treat ( NNT ) calculate . Spinal manipulation potentially serious risk include , fracture , numbness , tingle , injury spinal cord . However , risk low thoracic spine manipulation target study . In recent systematic review evaluate safety thoracic spine manipulation , author find seven case serious trauma result thoracic spine manipulation . The majority case perform chiropractor unsure whether participant contraindication manipulation . In order mitigate risk , participant thoroughly screen contraindication spinal manipulation . If adverse event occur , participant refer appropriate provider participation study discontinue .</detailed_description>
