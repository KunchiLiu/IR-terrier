	<brief_summary>Adductor canal block ( ACB ) , Saphenous nerve block , block purely sensory nerve share nerve supply knee joint hypothetical advantage well pain management less motor affection . Also , clear anatomical landmark increase success rate ( femoral artery ) ( * ) .On hand , branch femoral nerve far distal plexus , decrease block effectiveness . Likewise , great variation knee nerve supply . This prospective double-blinded randomize control trial compare ultrasound guide adductor canal block ( ACB ) versus ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block ( LPB ) patient undergo total knee arthroplasty aim decrease post-operative pain , help early mobilization well physiotherapy . This study hypothesize ACB , compare LPB , exhibit less motor , weakness , few opioids consumption well pain score .</brief_summary>
