	<detailed_description>Amoxicillin antibiotic family β-lactams sub-family penicillin A . It time-dependent bactericidal activity . It mainly active many bacterial specie frequently find infectious disease . It administer orally parenterally . It therefore frequently prescribe antibiotic , alone combination . Its elimination mainly urinary active form . It frequently prescribe intravenously high dos infectious disease department , indication like meningitis , endocarditis , listeriosis , document susceptible osteo-articular infection . Several amoxicillin treatment side effect report , like hypersensitivity reaction , gastrointestinal adverse reaction , mucocutaneous candidiasis , nervous system toxicity eventually kidney disease , namely occurrence crystalluria acute interstitial nephritis whose frequency undetermined . Literature concern occurrence crystalluria mainly base Case report incidence data . Crystalluria characterize presence amoxicillin trihydrate crystal urine , amoxicillin urinary supersaturation . The appearance large needle , isolate aggregate `` broom bush-like '' crystal , 50-300µm , birefringent polarize light . Amoxicillin crystalluria may vary importance , microscopic macroscopic , sometimes urinary tract obstruction may cause acute renal failure ( ARF ) require renal replacement therapy . A low urine output could associate occurrence crystalluria , well urine pH 5 7 , high urinary density high dos amoxicillin . Amoxicillin crystalluria deem uncommon . In national pharmacovigilance database , November 2013 , 9 report case , 12 78 year old , 5 severe one life-threatening . There high underreporting data , seem impact highly underestimated several reason : amoxicillin crystalluria seek routine clinical practice center , even high dose administrate . It clinically detectable microscopic even urine culture perform , amoxicillin crystal may mistake crystal . In investigator 's experience automate system always detect crystal . Moreover , patient likely receive high dos amoxicillin generally subject severe infection risk acute renal failure either due background previously initiate therapy ( like association aminoglycosides ) , imputability crystalluria occurrence episode acute renal failure among patient seldom consider . Finally , recent increase number report case national pharmacovigilance database incentive pay attention complication . The investigator also think occurrence amoxicillin crystalluria , even apart extreme case macroscopic crystalluria complicate oligo-anuric ARF , could increase risk intra-hospital ARF . The demonstration effect associate incidence significant crystalluria might justify research routine practice among patient receive intravenous high-dose amoxicillin ( IHDA ) . The search amoxicillin crystalluria rather simple , perform direct microscopic examination urine . If doubt diagnosis amoxicillin composition crystal , due atypical appearance concomitant administration drug may generate similar crystal , sample may send specialized laboratory infrared spectroscopy confirm amoxicillin crystal . IHDA treatment would situations high risk crystalluria . The highlight effect associate significant incidence crystalluria might justify systematic research recommendation routine practice patient receive IHDA . Following occurrence infectious disease department Reims university hospital case macroscopic crystalluria complicate ARF require renal replacement pharmacovigilance alert , search amoxicillin crystalluria systematic well several center Grand East France patient receive IHDA possibility watch patient carefully kidney level . The investigator propose , observational study multicenter longitudinal cohort , assess incidence amoxicillin crystalluria IHDA , search factor associate occurrence crystalluria measure impact crystalluria occurrence episode intra-hospital ARF . Data collect patient ' paper computerize record Center . - Sociodemographic data . - Weight size - Medical history - Date begin end hospitalization , date begin end antibiotic therapy - Ongoing treatment / Absorption nephrotoxics diuretic / Associated antibiotic - Indication amoxicillin treatment - intravenous intake urine output - Amoxicillin dosage amoxicillin brand use administration route - Biological data - Amoxicillin crystalluria ( Quantification ) / Presence crystal - Amoxicillin dosage ( perform ) - urine dipstick - urine sediment bacteriological analysis - Urinary pH - Creatinine creatinine clearance accord MDRD formula ( entrance , start treatment , departure , minimum maximum ) . - Albuminemia - Characteristics possible episode acute renal failure occur within 28 day follow IHDA - Retained mechanism acute renal failure - Renal ultrasound result ( perform ) . - Search crystalluria Statistical aspect : 1 . Justification number subject need The impact drug relate crystalluria amoxicillin treatment unknown . Literature subject compose case report . However frequency lower 5 % IHDA would significant clinical interest . The number subject need calculate 5 % alpha risk , expect frequency 10 % accuracy 5 % , lead require number subject 139 patient . Taking account 10 % possible exclusion , plan include 153 patient . According observed incidence crystalluria , extension number subject need discussed secondarily investigator obtain necessary power assess impact crystalluria risk acute renal failure . 2 . Statistical analysis : 1 . Flowchart : The synthesis patient include , exclude analyze expressed form flowchart . 2 . Analysis primary endpoint : It descriptive analysis cumulative incidence amoxicillin crystalluria IHDA . It express percentage 95 % confidence interval . c. Secondary endpoint : i. Descriptive analysis : Quantitative variable normal distribution describe mean standard deviation , quantitative variable non-normal distribution describe median interquartile range . Qualitative variable describe frequency percentage . ii . Univariate analysis : Depending secondary endpoint , variable explain ( dependent variable ) occurrence crystalluria occurrence acute renal failure . The measure association make calculate odds ratio 95 % confidence interval . iii . Multivariate analysis : Depending number event , multivariate analysis binary logistic regression model propose . On factor favor occurrence crystalluria , variables p-value less 0.20 univariate analysis . Amoxicillinemia force model . On factor favor occurrence acute renal failure , variables p-value less 0.20 univariate analysis . The occurrence crystalluria force model . The association measurement make calculate adjusted odds ratio 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
