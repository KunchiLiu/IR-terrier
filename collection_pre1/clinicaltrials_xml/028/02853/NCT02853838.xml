	<brief_title>Chest Physiotherapy Infants Between 0 12 Months Old With Acute Bronchiolitis SRV ( + )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis main cause hospital admission infant 1 year old Chile . Currently , approximately 4800 child admit hospital cold season , affect health service ' effectiveness . The frequent causal agent Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) . To date , specific treatment disease support measure recommend . Chest physiotherapy support measure improve mucociliary clearance reduces obstruction airway . A clinical trial effect prolong slow expiration ( PSE ) , chest wall vibration , provoke cough treatment bronchiolitis infant admit hospital find subgroup RSV require oxygen 10 hour less control group . Gomes Postiaux ( 2012 ) report 50 % decrease respiratory distress measure Wang score PSE suction compare traditional chest physiotherapy technique patient bronchiolitis RSV ( + ) . Currently recommendation Chile suggest chest physiotherapy outpatient bronchiolitis , guideline refer case inpatient . It propose carry randomize controlled trial infant one year old . The active group receive standard therapy , PSE , provoke coughing , control group receive standard therapy manual chest wall vibration . The effectiveness chest physiotherapy measure though clinical score respiratory distress , hour use supplementary oxygen , vital sign intervention group hospital stay . The main outcome clinical severity score 48 hour admission .</detailed_description>
