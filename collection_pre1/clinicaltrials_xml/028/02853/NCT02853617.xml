AV-101-16 : A single repeat dose , dose-escalation phase I/II study evaluate safety intramuscularly administer AV0328 . Approximately 16 subject enrol single U.S. center , base 4 subject per dose group . The study consist 2 part : Part 1 single dose , dose escalation study ; Part 2 ass effect second dose AV0328 . Part 1 - Single Administration AV0328 : Following injection , subject observed 28 day determine safety tolerability single administration AV0328 . Cohort 1 receive 15 µg give IM injection Day 1 . Cohorts 2 , 3 4 receive 30 , 75 150 µg , respectively . The first subject cohort must observe minimum 24 hour remain subject group treat . Dosage escalation occur final subject dose level observe minimum 2 day dose limit drug-related toxicity occur . Part 2 - Second Administration AV0328 : Following review safety tolerance minimum 22 day Part 1 Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) , subject dose level return receive additional injection dose level AV0328 Day 29 . Additional safety pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data collect Week 52 .</detailed_description>
