Written inform consent gain follow great 48 hour purpose read Participant Information sheet . The study involve two stage ( ) recruiting participant cross sectional analysis relationship physical activity level cardiovascular cognitive function , ( ii ) long exercise training study subsample volunteer ( i.e . participant volunteer exercise train ) . Participants stage 1 visit laboratory University three occasion ( three week period ) assess body composition , exercise tolerance , current physical activity level , cognitive function arterial cardiac health . Each visit last 60 - 90 minute . Participants provide accelerometer wear period one week order assess movement count sedentary behaviour . Stage 2 include participant volunteer exercise training component ( approx 60 ) . These participant randomly divide two group . Both group exercise three time per week 12 week duration . Group 1 exercise traditional manner moderate intensity , whilst second group exercise heavy intensity short burst . Both group complete amount work two differ mode . Both group attend laboratory twice per week supervise exercise session also perform one home base 30 minute brisk walk per week . All participant re-examine 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study involve two stage ( ) recruiting participant cross sectional analysis relationship physical activity level cardiovascular cognitive function , ( ii ) long exercise training study subsample volunteer . 100 participant stage 1 visit laboratory University three occasion ( within three week period ) assess anthropometric outcome , body composition , exercise tolerance , cognitive function arterial cardiac health . Each visit last 60 - 90 minute . Participants provide accelerometer wear period one week order assess movement count sedentary behaviour . Stage 2 include participant happy continue exercise training phase . These participant match age BMI randomly ( match pair ) allocate one two group . Both group exercise three time per week 12 week duration . Group 1 exercise traditional manner undertake continuous exercise , whilst Group 2 exercise heavy intensity short burst ( interval exercise ) . Both group complete amount work two differ mode . Both group attend laboratory twice per week supervise exercise session also perform one home base 30 minute brisk walk per week . All participant re-examine 12 week . Recruitment participant One hundred participant combination ( ) local advertisement and/or ( b ) whose detail hold research database ( previous volunteer indicate willingness contact future study ) seek volunteer study . Participants contact via email/telephone/letter provide information regard study . All volunteer interested participate contact provide general information preliminary telephone screen interview . This used check main inclusion exclusion criterion . The woman fit criterion send participant information sheet read carefully still interested invited attend first laboratory visit screen session . Participants great 48 hour assess participant information sheet attend first visit , eligible , ask provide write informed consent . Laboratory Visits Visit 1 During visit study procedure explain detail participant , write informed consent take . A thorough medical history obtain participant ask complete Recruitment Information Questionnaire ( RIQ ) confirm inclusion/ exclusion criterion . Participants complete National Adult Reading Test ( NART ) estimate premorbid intelligence level . Participants also complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) review determine whether participant fit continue study . Simple measure body weight , height waist circumference take . Participants complete practice version cognitive test battery demonstrate test , ensure participant understand perform test correctly assess compliance ( effort ) . Participants complete cycle test stationary bicycle supervision investigator medic . Visit 2 The second visit involve several measure arterial health require participant attend 12 hour fast state . Blood vessel function assess use blood pressure cuff around low arm period 5 minute . Cardiac structure function assess use two-dimensional ( 2D ) echocardiography . Vascular function assess use ultrasound applanation tonometry . All procedures non-invasive . Percentages body fat muscle mass measure use bioimpedance . A 60ml blood sample take used ass endothelial progenitor cell number function , insulin sensitivity , cholesterol level part assessment health artery vascular system . Visit 3 On third visit cognitive function test complete , require participant attend 12 hour fast state . Participants perform 45 minute battery cognitive test . Following cognitive test , participant ask complete cognitive test evaluation questionnaire ass subjective objective cognition . At end third laboratory visit participant provide ActiHeart accelerometer ( Actigraph , Pensacola , USA ) wear period one week order assess movement count sedentary behaviour . At end seven day accelerometer give back collected team data download . The three baseline laboratory visit plus seven day use ActiHeart accelerometer come stage 1 study . Participants ask continue exercise training stage ( stage 2 ) , willing volunteer move second stage experiment . All measure repeat 12 week ( 78 hour 5 day follow cessation last exercise training session ) .</detailed_description>
