	<brief_summary>This study multicentre , randomize , open label comparison pancreatic beta cell recovery preservation Vildagliptin 100mg daily Metformin ( 1000 - 2500mg ) daily 96 week 203 patient type 2 diabetes conduct four center Chennai . The primary outcome measure compare effect Vildagliptin versus Metformin Pancreatic beta cell function type 2 diabetic patient measure Insulin secretion rate ( ISR ) relative glucose0-2hr ( pmol/min/m2/mmol/L ) . The secondary outcome effect Vildagliptin versus Metformin base treatment glycaemic variable term Percent HbA1c reduction , C-peptide response , Insulin glucose ratio , Reduction fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , 2hr postprandial glucose ( PPG ) baseline , Improvement insulin sensitivity , Improvement oral disposition index , Percentage patient reach glycemic target ( ) HbA1c ≤ 6.5 % ( ii ) HbA1c ≤ 7.0 % , overall study population General safety term occurrence adverse event</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject invite study center local population willing participate trial . Each subject inform orally write study prior inclusion study subject give write informed consent include . The selection subject base inclusion exclusion criterion define protocol . The selected subject give screen number subject screening procedure find eligible candidate enrollment . The screening procedure include obtain subject 's anthropometric data , baseline symptomatology , medical history , physical examination , laboratory investigation like blood glucose ( fast , 30min &amp; 2hr meal ) , HbA1c , ^Plasma insulin ( fast , 30min &amp; 2hr meal ) , ^2hr C peptide , Serum Amylase , Lipase , Urea , Creatinine , Gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) , Urine albumin/creatinine ratio urine pregnancy ( applicable ) . The selected subject screen procedure give subject number randomize two arm . In Arm 1 advise take Vildagliptin 100mg daily 96 week . In Arm 2 assign Metformin ( 1000mg - 2500 mg/ day accord physician 's preference 96 week subject ask come follow week 12 , week 24 , week 48 , week 72 week 96 . Subjects give sufficient quantity study drug . They instruct take one tablet Vildagliptin 50mg per day , 30 minute breakfast morning second tablet night , 30 minute dinner Metformin tablet per instruction give physician . Subjects instruct maintain record dosing detail patient diary . Blood sample take investigation blood glucose ( fast , 30min &amp; 2hr meal ) , HbA1c , Plasma insulin ( fast , 30min &amp; 2hr meal ) , C peptide ( 2hr meal ) , fast serum Amylase , Lipase , Urea , Creatinine , GGT , Urine albumin/creatinine ratio Urine pregnancy test ( require ) specify visit chart . There three telephonic visit week 36 , week 60 week 84 . During visit subject inquire health status phone drug next three month dispense courier deliver home coordinator . If glycaemic control constantly satisfactory ( HbA1c ≥ 8.5 % ) visit 3 , rescue drug ( Glimepiride ) add arm clinical biochemical test do per visit chart . With Glimepiride A1C &gt; 9 % insulin add subject withdrawn study .</detailed_description>
