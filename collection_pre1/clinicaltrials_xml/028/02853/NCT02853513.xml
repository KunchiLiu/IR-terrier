	<brief_summary>The scientific approach project propose build cohort `` psychological injury '' post-attack 13 November 2015 . This call patient `` involve '' , ie patient directly witness event either come automatic gunfire close explosion , whether physically injure . The main objective define validate model transition acute stress disorder ( ASD ) posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) good detection risk unfavorable thus well patient support . The first step determine independent risk factor find analytic prospective cohort study . Bayesian model well suit exercise integrate ( ) context relate patient , ( ii ) context relate trauma , ( iii ) immediate reaction long-term latter . They particularly suit understand brain disorder say information ( prior probability ) wrong improper memory traumatic event . The confrontation descend information perceive bottom-information could partly responsible symptom PTSD . Once validate , model characterize individual level risk unfavorable patient ( calculate probability develop PTSD ) assess epidemiological impact long-term cohort event consider . These determination necessary prerequisite optimize mean support current future casualty . The investigator main objective define Bayesian model describe resilient function face trauma also allow describe possible evolution ASD PTSD error . The state PTSD determine PCL-S scale .</brief_summary>
