	<detailed_description>Recruitment patient achieve department digestive surgery . It involve 122 patient severe obesity undergo bariatric surgery schedule within digestive surgery department . Patients recruit examined evaluate presence severity periodontitis , separate either group 1 : patient moderate severe periodontitis , group 2 : patient without mild periodontitis . The day surgery , blood sample collect analysis circulate metabolic inflammatory marker . Collection stimulate saliva , periodontal sample faeces sample ( 50 g ) also carry bacteria determination . During surgical procedure , sample visceral adipose tissue ( 50 g ) collect used periodontal bacteria detection inflammatory marker analysis .</detailed_description>
