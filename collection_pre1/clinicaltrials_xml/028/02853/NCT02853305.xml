	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone participant advance metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( bladder cancer ) . The primary hypothesis pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy superior chemotherapy alone respect Progression-free Survival ( PFS ) Overall Survival ( OS ) participant program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive tumor participant ( include participant PD-L1 positive tumor PD-L1 negative tumor ) .</brief_summary>
