	<brief_title>A Study CAN008 Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAN008 glycosylated fusion protein consist extracellular domain human CD95 ( APO-1/Fas ) Fc domain human IgG1 . CAN008 block interaction CD95 cognate ligand CD95L . The target CAN008 inhibition CD95L . CD95L express glioblastoma whose cell resistant CD95-mediated apoptosis . CD95L show crucial trigger invasion migration tumor cell neutralize CD95L abolishes invasive capacity glioblastoma cell . The purpose study : 1 . To describe toxicity associate regimen adult patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . 2 . To determine duration disease free survival overall survival associate therapy .</detailed_description>
