	<brief_summary>Kawasaki disease ( KD ) acute systemic vasculitic syndrome coronary tropism . It report worldwide , ten time common Asian population . It second vasculitis child frequency rheumatoid purpura . It occur 80 % case 1 5 year , maximal incidence around age 12 month . KD well understood cause yet unknown . It may autoimmune disorder . The problem affect mucous membrane , lymph node , wall blood vessel , heart.The clinical picture KD associate persistent fever antipyretic resistance mucocutaneous sign bulky cervical lymphadenopathy usually unilateral . There currently vaccine available Kawasaki disease extremely important able recognize symptom set become severe . Chagas disease ( CD ) cause parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . Acute CD occur immediately infection , may last week month . Infection may mild asymptomatic . There may fever swell around site inoculation , acute infection may result severe inflammation heart muscle . The notion pathology CD autoimmune component initially base find circulate antibody bind heart tissue antigens patient chronically infected T. cruzi . A recent study report possible antigen ( non-cruzi-related antibody NCRA ) mimicry characterize serological reactivity well-defined T. cruzi antigen blood sample individual expose parasite . The measured seroprevalence cross-reactivity favor highly prevalent immunogen acquire childhood . There similarities mechanism CD KD : could interest explore presence NCRA blood sample adult history KD . The objective study measurement biomarker NCRA serum adult history KD compare control population . This measurement prevalence may permit associate NCRA possible pathogenic agent .</brief_summary>
