	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) group non-progressive motor dysfunction often change , secondary injury brain abnormality occur early stage development . In child CP , brain injury lead delay motor development first week , associate muscular spasticity . Drug treatment include oral treatment ( baclofen tizanidine ) injectable treatment like Botox ( intramuscular injection ) neurolysis alcohol phenol ( local injection nerve ) . Regarding botulinum toxin , study question effectiveness . However , publication pathophysiology human muscle CP child toxin injection find . The action toxin neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) muscle structure unknown child CP . The primary objective study describe structural abnormality CP child 's muscle follow multiple toxin injection term NMJ fragmentation axonal sprouting . Secondary objective : To evaluate relationship : - The severity motor impairment muscle structural abnormality . - The clinical measure spasticity muscle structural abnormality . - To compare structure spastic muscle toxin injection spastic muscle without toxin injection For muscle multiple toxin injection , assess relationship : - The number toxin injection muscle structural abnormality . - The date first injection muscle structural abnormality . - The total dose inject toxin muscle structural abnormality . - The nature product inject muscle structural abnormality . This innovative study improve knowledge effect long-term botulinum toxin injection muscle ( therefore safety usual care ) , spastic muscle NMJ CP child , pathophysiology CP child 's muscle . All visit act perform accord usual patient follow-up . Only biopsy perform addition , take injected muscle plan operation . A biopsy may also perform muscle without toxin injection act make possible planned surgery . No biopsy make muscle would require surgery .</brief_summary>
