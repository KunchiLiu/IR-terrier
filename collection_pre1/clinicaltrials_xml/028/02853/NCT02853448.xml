	<brief_summary>There many instance access centrifuge ( Emergency ward , EMT truck , battle field , etc . ) result need immediately ( myocardial infarction ) ; new collection tube could separate serum plasma whole blood immediately upon , , collection , would extremely beneficial . Such new tube could save time cost eliminate centrifugation step currently require obtain serum plasma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Device That Separates Blood Cells From Serum/Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new blood collection tube recently develop ; tube separate serum/plasma whole blood blood flow tube . This accomplished filter set inside tube ; filter set may impregnate anti coagulant agent , sodium citrate ( blue top ) may virgin ( red top ) . The serum collection part tube disconnect filter part upon completion serum collection , cap lid , forward bed-side instrument test analysis laboratory . The filter part discard hazardous waste container . Blood Separation free red cell damage achieve control blood flow rate device . A 30 second flow intake typical . The flow rate controller use experiment element add line standard blood draw needle set . This study conduct compare concentration routine clinical chemistry ( analytes electrolytes ) measure serum/plasma obtain routine standard blood collection tube novel blood collection tube separate blood cell whole blood blood drawn . Routine clinical lab perform serum plasma obtain standard novel tube evaluate efficacy novel tube recover cell-free serum measure various routine blood analytes compare standard tube . Procedure Plasma , well serum , collect analyzed study . While blood collection procedure , collection blood standard tube differs serumSTAT tube ; subsequent post-treatment blood/serum/plasma differs one . The serum ready analysis completion step . The procedure draw blood use new device explain demonstrated phlebotomist ensure ( ) comfortable use device . The following routine clinical chemistry show metabolic panel shall measure ; 1 . Albumin 2 . AlkalinePhosphatase 3 . ALT ( Alanine Transaminase ) 4 . AST ( Aspartate Transaminase ) 5 . BUN ( Blood Urea Nitrogen ) 6 . Creatinine 7 . Glucose 8 . Total Bilirubin 9 . Total Protein 10 . Calcium 11 . Carbon Dioxide 12 . Chloride 13 . Potassium 14 . Sodium 15 . Troponin I Furthermore , BUN/Creatinine ratio shall also present data set .</detailed_description>
