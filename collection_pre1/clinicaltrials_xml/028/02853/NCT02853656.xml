This prospective comparative study fFN ( control ) PhIGFBP-1 test ( comparator ) woman singleton pregnancy 22-34 week gestation present self-reported sign , symptom complaint suggestive preterm labour . Both test do every participant - test sequence every 5 participant fFN test undertaken first next cohort 5 PhIGFBP-1 swab take first . This remove potential bias surround test undertaken first .
