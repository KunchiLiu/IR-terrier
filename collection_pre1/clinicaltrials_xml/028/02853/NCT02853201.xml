	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation life-saving treatment critically ill patient unable breathe . At time recovery , separation ventilator perform without difficulty majority patient . However , approximately 15 % patient experience extubation failure , i.e . re-intubated extubation within period 48 hour 7 day . Patients fail extubation expose long duration mechanical ventilation , high rate ventilator-acquired pneumonia , high morbidity , high ICU mortality . Therefore , relevant importance clinician identify patient risk extubation failure soon ventilation discontinue . However , current clinical assessment poor predictive performance : physiological variable helpful obtain invasively use esophageal gastric catheter . Using ultrasound measurement assess activity respiratory muscle could particular interest purpose . By show early recruitment accessory muscle well diaphragm dysfunction hyperactivity , ultrasound could help clinician pay great attention patient therefore try apply specific therapeutic . There several advantage ultrasound : non-invasive , available intensive care unit , previous study report reasonable reliability measurement . In present study , aim ass contractility respiratory muscle ( diaphragm , intercostal , sternocleidomastoid ) use ultrasounds identify patient may risk extubation failure and/or ICU readmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Intercostal Muscles After Extubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single centre , prospective , physiologic study extubated patient ( n = 110 ) ass contractility diaphragm , intercostal , sternocleidomastoid muscle . The purpose determine whether employ ultrasound early extubation useful diagnostic tool identify patient may risk extubation failure and/or intensive care unit ( ICU ) re-admission . The study perform Medical-Surgical ICU St. Michael 's Hospital . Once clinical team decide extubate patient , research team approach patient consent ( capable ) patient 's substitute decision maker . Demographic information extract medical chart enter study case report form ( CRF ) . Ultrasounds diaphragm , intercostal , sternocleidomastoid muscle perform within 2 hour extubation repeat within 24 hour extubation ( feasible ) . The following physiological biological variable collect spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) : mode ventilation setting , Arterial Blood Gas ( ABG ) result , heart rate , arterial blood pressure , peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , respiratory rate , Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) , temperature , fluid balance last 24 hour , Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score , rapid shallow breathe index ( RSBI ) . At time ultrasound measurement , follow physiological variable collect : heart rate , arterial blood pressure , SpO2 , respiratory rate , Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) , cough , Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) , ambient air , oxygenation , use non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) , level dyspnea , level comfort , nasal flaring , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) score , Respiratory Intensive Care Observation Scale ( RICOS ) . Outcome data record include : extubation failure , use NIV and/or high-flow nasal oxygen cannula post extubation , re-intubation , ICU discharge/re-admission status , tracheostomy . A 7-day follow-up ICU discharge signify completion study .</detailed_description>
