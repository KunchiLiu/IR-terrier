	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document appearance androgen receptor isoform splice variant 7 ( AR-V7 ) expression course therapy castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . II . To determine whether detectable AR-V7 associate shortened duration treatment benefit abiraterone enzalutamide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine presence expression level AR-V7 impact response docetaxel . II . To determine point AR-V7 arise androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) presence expression correspond castration resistance . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine androgen receptor isoform splice variant ( AR-Vs ) AR-V7 play role resistance / response therapy explore study . II . To determine , patient express mutation androgen receptor ( AR ) , genetic alteration associate treatment outcome therapy explore study . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood collection every 3 month ADT , every 4 week treatment abiraterone / enzalutamide , every 3 week administration docetaxel . Samples analyze cell-free ribonucleic acid ( cfRNA ) , cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( cfDNA ) , AR-V7 , AR-Vs via quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . After completion study , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
