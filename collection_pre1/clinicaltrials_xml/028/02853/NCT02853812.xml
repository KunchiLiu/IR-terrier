	<brief_summary>The propose research identify brain area activate deactivated tinnitus human . The identification area expect able treat tinnitus refractory traditional therapy method brain stimulation . Furthermore , technique would useful verify effectiveness treatment relieve tinnitus . The brain activation measure fMRI perform position rest , inhibition tinnitus , application sound inhibit tinnitus . This comparison identify specific brain area activate deactivated tinnitus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . What purpose research ? The propose research identify brain area activate deactivated tinnitus human . The identification area expect able treat tinnitus refractory traditional therapy method brain stimulation . Furthermore , technique would useful verify effectiveness treatment relieve tinnitus . 2 . What methodology ? This diagnosis base functional brain imaging MRI ( fMRI ) . The study conduct 30 subject unilateral tinnitus , stable lesion origin inhibit mask sound . The brain activation measure fMRI perform position rest , inhibition tinnitus , application sound inhibit tinnitus . This comparison identify specific brain area activate deactivated tinnitus . 3 . What expect benefit ? Direct individual benefit could possibly meet participant study . Indeed , determination mask noise afford set mask system reduce tinnitus patient wish . Moreover , case identification brain area activate inactivated tinnitus subject , may propose carry transcranial magnetic brain stimulation area attempt relieve tinnitus , accord stimulation protocol date tinnitus . This achieve personalized approach treat tinnitus . Besides expect individual benefit , expect benefit collective order , give highly variable success rate , generally limited treatment tinnitus .</detailed_description>
