	<brief_summary>This study divide 2 part . Part 1a conduct evaluate safety , tolerability , relative bioavailability 2 free base tablet formulation ( relate compound [ RC ] high shear wet granulation [ HSWG ] ) compare reference capsule formulation fast condition . This 3-period ; cross-over study guide gepotidacin formulation use future study . Following review pharmacokinetic ( PK ) safety data Part 1a , decision make whether proceed Parts 1b 2 . Part 1b 2-period , cross-over study ass effect food PK select gepotidacin tablet formulation Part 1a . In Part 2 , PK select gepotidacin tablet formulation Part 1a Japanese ( 2a ) Chinese ( 2b ) subject evaluate fasted condition . The duration study ( Screening Follow-up visit ) approximately 44 day ( Part 1a ) , 41 day ( Part 1b ) 38 day ( Part 2a 2b ) , respectively . The approximate number subject enrol Part 1a 27 ( 9 subject 3 treatment sequence ) , 16 Part 1b ( 8 subject 2 treatment sequence ) 12 Japanese 12 Chinese subject Part 2a 2b , respectively .</brief_summary>
