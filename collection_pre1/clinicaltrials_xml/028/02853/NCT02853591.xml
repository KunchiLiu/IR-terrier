	<detailed_description>This randomized-controlled double-blinded trial examine outcome total laparoscopic hysterectomy perform low high pressure pneumoperitoneum either novel pressure-barrier insufflator ( AirSeal® ) conventional insufflator . All patient schedule total laparoscopic hysterectomy ( without robotic-assistance ) screen eligibility study . If eligible , standard inform consent process ensue . All research activity commence day surgery , pre-operative preparation area . Enrolled subject undergo standard registration pre-operative preparation staff preoperative nurse , include placement intravenous access line administration standard pre-operative intravenous medication ( typically ondansetron , dexamethasone , ketorolac ) . While pre-operative area , prior sedative drug administration anesthesia , patient complete 11-point Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) baseline pain , well baseline 18-question quality life survey Abdominal Surgery Impact Scale ( ASIS ) . Both study instrument self-administered patient collect research team . A baseline blood collection perform pre-operative area research team assistant send inflammatory marker . The subject move operating room anesthesia team apply pad use Cheetah Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring ( NICOM ) system , addition standard anesthesia monitoring equipment . The Cheetah NICOM activate baseline measurement prior anesthesia induction . Induction , intubation , anesthesia administration perform accord standard practice dedicate group anesthesia provider . A second set hemodynamic measurement Cheetah NICOM measure intubation , prior pneumoperitoneum . A select group anesthesia provider familiar protocol administer anesthesia use non-depolarizing muscle relaxant continuously adjust less one twitch pneumoperitoneum . Prior incision , preoperative prophylactic antibiotic surgical sterile preparation perform per usual technique . Bilateral upper extremity place tucked position , shoulder pad use case . An 18g peripheral IV ( ideally antecubital ) place allow intra-operative blood draw . This may place anesthesia induction , prior arm tucking . Randomization occur patient anesthetize , prior surgical start time allow proper equipment open surgical field without waste . Randomization one four group equal allocation ( 1:1:1:1 ratio ) : 1 . Conventional insufflation 15mmHg intra-abdominal pressure . ( Group 1 ) 2 . Conventional insufflation 9mmHg intra-abdominal pressure ( Group 2 ) 3 . AirSeal® insufflation 15mmHg intra-abdominal pressure ( Group 3 ) 4 . AirSeal® insufflation 9mmHg intra-abdominal pressure ( Group 4 ) If randomize AirSeal® group , tri-lumen filter tube set dedicate access trocar open placed surgical field . If randomize conventional insufflation group , conventional insufflation tube additional conventional trocar open placed surgical field . The patient remain blind randomization throughout study , research team assistant responsible blood draws administration NRS ASIS questionnaire . Laparoscopic entry typically obtain optical trocar periumbilical region , placement may modify surgeon 's discretion . Initial pneumoperitoneum establish trocar pressure 15mmHg group . Pressure remain set Trendelenburg position placement necessary laparoscopic trocars . Data record third time Cheetah NICOM point . Once trocars insert , AirSeal® system activate necessary base group randomization , pressure decrease 9mmHg indicate base randomization . Additional recording data Cheetah NICOM occur 10 minute 30 minute pressure decrease , surgery proceed accord surgeon 's preferred technique . Any surgeon-directed modification intra-abdominal pressure time surgery completion and/or patient safety record . Thirty minute pneumoperitoneum establish , research team assistant perform second blood draw inflammatory marker . The surgery complete per typical fashion , total operative time estimate blood loss record . A final Cheetah NICOM record make 5 minute deflation pneumoperitoneum . The patient emerge anesthesia usual monitoring transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) meeting appropriate routine criterion . A staff PACU nurse care subject PACU administer pain medication necessary and/or per patient request . All pain medication administration hospital record Epic electronic health record ( EHR ) . The amount patient 's narcotic administration record EHR document study file . The staff PACU nurse blind subject group allocation . The research team assistant administer NRS pain survey patient two hour post-operatively inquire regard presence shoulder pain . The third blood draw also occur timepoint research team assistant . All patient undergo plan same-day discharge home . If unable discharged , stay overnight hospital document rationale . On day surgery , subject contact research team assistant administer NRS pain survey telephone ( person still hospital ) ask patient report number narcotic pain pill use since discharge dosage . Presence shoulder pain ask . If patient still hospital , narcotic usage collect EHR . Per standard routine , patient ask return clinic two week post-operatively evaluation examination . The 18-question ASIS administer visit blind research team assistant . If patient complete `` two-week visit '' within 1-3 week surgery , research team assistant administer ASIS telephone . The patient exit study visit . Blinding patient broken administration ASIS , standard practice provide patient copy operative report visit , describe pneumoperitoneum setting use case .</detailed_description>
