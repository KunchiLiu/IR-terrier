	<brief_title>Registry COPD Patients From Outpatient Polyclinic Healthcare Institutions Russian Federation Moscow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry COPD patient fact represent two part non-interventional multicenter descriptive study : one part retrospective study include COPD patient , part observational prospective cohort study COPD patient include registry newly diagnose outpatient surveillance select polyclinic institution Moscow annual retrospective entry data . Monitoring perform 3 year regular ( yearly ) entry data concern patient diagnosed COPD ; include patient registered diagnosis J40 - J44 accord ICD-10 spirometry result confirm COPD diagnosis , study start outpatient surveillance , also newly register patient diagnosed COPD ( ICD-10 J40 - J44 , confirm spirometry result ) conduction registry program select polyclinic institution Moscow ( accord ICD : J40 - Bronchitis , specify acute chronic , J41 - Simple mucopurulent chronic bronchitis , J41.0 - Simple chronic bronchitis , J41.8 - Mixed simple mucopurulent chronic bronchitis , J 42 - Unspecified chronic bronchitis , J 43 - Emphysema , J 44 - Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) base regular ( yearly ) retrospective analysis patient record data entry consolidate database . The present observational multicenter descriptive study conduct set routine clinical practice outpatient polyclinic institution . There hypothesis test study . The study conduct outpatient polyclinic institution primary medical care system Moscow . Pulmonologists primary medical care system engage investigator . These physician , patient tentative COPD diagnosis refer Russian Federation within scope responsibility access source medical record evaluate quality diagnosis extent treatment prescribe COPD patient . The present study observational therefore require treatment regimen direction patient management . The patient receive medical care line routine practice treatment disease Russian Federation . Patient participation study way affect principle extent treatment receive patient accord routine clinical practice . Physicians-investigators enter study information ( data ) concern COPD patient , already register select medical treatment preventive care institution , newly register patient seek attention outpatient polyclinic institution . Patient data enter registry de-identified . The patient identify screen number initial . Then Physician-investigator evaluate patient compliance inclusion criterion . The study enrol patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Only physician enters patient data regional COPD registry possess patient contact information , henceforth physician enter de-identified patient data accord study design . This physician influence choice examination extent , treatment strategy medication . Primarily epidemiological method use presentation study result . Descriptive analysis approach apply analysis study objective . Descriptive statistic use analysis study population , baseline clinical data . Descriptive statistic include frequency table ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum continuous variable ; n , frequency percentage categorical variable ) . Percentages evaluate together 95 % confidence interval ( appropriate case ) .</detailed_description>
