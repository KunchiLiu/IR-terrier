	<brief_summary>Continuous enteral feeding common type nutrition use critically ill patient despite non-physiologic , mammalian alimentary tract design intermittent ingestion nutrient . The small number randomize controlled study compare intermittent gastric feed ( IGF ) continuous gastric feed ( CGF ) intensive care unit demonstrate IGF safe , feasible short time goal nutrition . Studies healthy adult also demonstrate mean glucose concentration ( MGC ) lower bolus enteral feeding use instead continuous feed ; change glucose-insulin metric might beneficial critically ill patient population stress hyperglycemia common . This study compare effect CGF IGF critically ill medical patient population . Glucose-insulin dynamic type enteral feed analyze perform randomize crossover study compare effect CGF IGF MGC , total insulin infuse , glucose variability ( GV ) , episodes hypoglycemia maximum glucose concentration value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Effects Intermittent Continuous Enteral Feeding Glucose-Insulin Dynamics Critically Ill Medical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-blinded randomize crossover study generalize population critically ill adult . The population study define age 18-90 admit Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) . This study compare glucose-insulin dynamic critically ill adult fee use either CGF IGF scheme glucose concentration maintain 140-180 mg/dl use insulin infusion protocol . Randomization perform use computer generate random number keep individually seal envelope . All participant nasal gastric oral gastric ( NG/OG ) tube previously place nutritional need . The amount Osmolite give determine ideal weight participant : 1.2 cal/ml Osmolite caloric goal 25 kcal/kg/day . Feeding intolerance develops define : excessive abdominal distention , emesis , abdominal pain , vomit gastric residual &gt; 250 ml IGF gastric residual &gt; 500 ml CGF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1890 year Anticipated ICU stay great 72 hour Expected indication enteral feeding within first 2448 hour ICU admission Any contraindication relate oral nasal gastric tube , Osmolite 1.2 cal/ml , goal rate ( goal volume ) Osmolite 1.2 cal/ml use 24hour goal nutrition , gastric feed due anatomical/physiological pathology , ideal body weight exceed 85 kg maintain goal volume intermittent arm 301 ml potassium great 6.4 . Planned procedure test would require hold gastric feed protocol . Pregnancy , confirm pregnancy test female &lt; 60 year age . Hemodynamic instability define vasoactive medication requirement blood pressure support cardiac arrhythmia include : Norepinephrine ≥ 5 mcg/min , Epinephrine ≥ 5 mcg/min , Dopamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min , Milrinone 0.375mcg/kg/min , Vasopressin &gt; 0.04 Units/min , Dobutamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min , vasoactive drip , combination low dose vasopressor list . Atrial Nodal blocking agent use continuous drip form include diltiazem , esmolol amiodarone allow require vasoactive medication restriction . Prior surgical procedure would preclude goal rate/or volume CGF/IGF include : previous partial complete gastrectomy massive intestinal resection leave less 200 cm small bowel . Screening glucose concentration le 120 mg/dl NPO unless diabetic .</criteria>
