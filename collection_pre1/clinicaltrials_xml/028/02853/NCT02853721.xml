	<brief_title>Early Prediction Hypocalcaemia Following Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The aim randomize control trial validate result previous prospective cohort study conduct surgical unit regard use concomitant intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) serum calcium measurement predict hypocalcemia total thyroidectomy . Methods : From January 2014 January 2015 , 150 patient underwent total thyroidectomy department divide two group . The experimental group submit assay iPTH six hour surgery whilst control group submit daily assay serum calcium phosphorus . Sensitivity specificity different serum measurement calculate use Receiver-operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve .</detailed_description>
