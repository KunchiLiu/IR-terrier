	<brief_title>A Lifestyle Intervention Targeting Enhanced Health Function Persons With Chronic SCI Caregiver/Care-Receiver Relationships : Effects Caregiver Co-Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current proposal address compel problem cardiometabolic disease risk functional decline person disability spinal cord injury disease ( SCI/D ) . 'Obesity/overweight ' address project - major component cardiometabolic disease risk ( CMD ) - represent sole chronic condition whose speed growth widespread dispersion parallel pandemic communicable disease . Nearly 2/3 Americans currently overweight obese , growth rate exceed 10 % past decade . The prevalence impact obesity expect worsen . Obesity-related health risk cross line gender , geographic region , socioeconomic status , race , heritage , educational level , strongly associate comorbid condition include : cardiometabolic syndrome , hypertension , diabetes , inflammatory disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , stroke , osteoarthritis , sleep apnea , depression , cancer , respiratory failure , disorder coagulation , degenerative joint disease . All disorder widely report elevated prevalence people physical disability ( PWPD ) . A study base pool data 1994-5 National Health Interview Survey , 1994-5 Disability Supplement , 1995 'Healthy People 2000 ' Supplement report 66 % high rate obesity among PWPD general population . A regional study report extreme obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] ≥ 40 ) four time prevalent among PWPD without . Prevalence rate overweight obesity person chronic SCI/D equally daunt , range 55 % 95.7 % population . Numerous cause explain accretion body fat SCI include sarcopenia leading loss metabolically active muscle mass , reduce whole body energy expenditure , restrict choice exercise conditioning , hypercaloric diet . Irrespective cause , weight gain disability bring diminish work capacity , musculoskeletal decline , pain , accelerate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , progressive life dissatisfaction . Overweight/obesity SCI/D also disturbingly co-morbid dyslipidemia , glucose intolerance , insulin resistance , 'pro-inflammatory phenotype , risk postprandial lipemia . Increasing body mass ( BM ) promote wheelchair injury dysfunction , impose significant burden self-image perceived health , far difficult reverse obesity occur person without disability . Overweight particular : ) Poses functional limitation , restrict physical activity , independence , community integration ; b ) affect ease transferring , joint function , fracture risk ; , c ) compromise 'activities daily live ' ( ADLs ) 39 % individual SCI . Despite risk concern effective solution problem evade researcher , clinician , stakeholder SCI . While overweight body implication health function PWPD , also impact caregiver . Within past quarter decade predictable shift many health function relate responsibility adjuvant provider ( i.e. , healthcare provider extenders ) -- so-called 'caregivers ' - challenge administer great health functional demand age PWPD similarly experience health functional 3 decline accompany age . This shift provider likely continue , possibly worsen due uncertain future disability coverage within tentative American health system . The investigator already start observe - yet fully comprehend - many complex difficulty impose age PWPD caregiver , speculate effectively intervene . Unlike caregiver person Alzheimer 's disease Parkinson 's disease , caregiver people wheelchair dependency require physically active , lift/push/roll impair body far often , often assume caregiving responsibility earlier life PWPD . While clinician researcher often focus person disability , caregiver leave care plan . It thus surprising pain , anxiety , depression among caregiver PWPD exceedingly prevalent . Encouraging evidence already suggest important role primary secondary lifestyle intervention ( LI ) form weight-lessening fitness-promoting nutrition exercise improve health function people age disability . Comprehensive LI program exercise , nutrition , behavioral support people without disability design systematically test multi-center clinical trial , find effective short term promote weight loss lessen conversion rate frank diabetes . The LI program compare pharmacotherapy actually find effective . Programmatic modification make community deployment LI plan , test long-term follow-up show remarkable success sustain - even improve - benefit obtain initial treatment . These research finding make LI program weight-loss promote reconditioning exercise , nutrition , behavioral support legitimate candidate test PWPD , although study ever do . Moreover , impact intervention caregiver burden never examine , although reasonable conjecture loss body BM improved fitness/function care-receivers would reduce global caregiver burden . Further , evidence support lifestyle health benefit care-receiver caregiver enrol link behavioral intervention program , make relationship dyadic partner benefit one another coordinate intervention intrigue intervention benefit . To : ) address concern problem overweight/obesity SCI , b ) good understand impact health function person SCI caregiver , c ) intervene hazard inaction would forecast additional decline , investigator conduct randomize , control , multi-center intervention study examine person disability SCI caregiver , together enrol dyadic partner . Key question address whether : ) people disability SCI benefit LI plan improve health function , b ) caregiver people disability SCI benefit LI plan improve health function , c ) co-participation caregiver partner LI curriculum provide cross benefit partner , ) benefit clinical intervention long-lasting minimal supervision . The investigator use intervention participant SCI model Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) incorporate population-appropriate exercise , nutrition , behavioral support . Caregivers ( link partner ) randomize either 'behavioral support ' 'control condition ' . Clinical train take place 6 month follow 6-month minimally supervise extension phase . Outcomes tested participant SCI focus domains health function reflect fitness , cardioendocrine risk inflammatory stress ; multi-dimensional function pain ; Sol independence ; self-efficacy , program acceptance , life satisfaction . Outcomes tested caregiver focus multidimensional function pain ; , Quality Life ( QoL ) independence , latter include perceive caregiver burden .</detailed_description>
