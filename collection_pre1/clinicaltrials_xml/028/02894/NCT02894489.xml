	<brief_title>Changes Visual Function , Ocular Surface Structures Physiology After Long-Termed Contact Lens Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contact lens fit important treatment many ocular disease provide three main therapeutic application : visual correction , protection ocular surface , cosmetic sport purpose . The ophthalmology department NTUH set contact lens special clinic one comprehensive refractive service . The investigator provide corneal lens Rose K lenses optical correction keratoconus patient ; investigator also fit large scleral lens correction irregular astigmatism post-penetrating keratoplasty post-refractive surgery patient . In addition , contact lens adjuvant therapy ocular surface disorder severe dry eye limbal insufficiency . There research prove inflammatory mediator neutrophil increase long-termed wear silicon hydrogel soft lens night orthokeratology lens . They also conclude lens wear affected corneal epithelial proliferation . However , physiological change long-termed wear large diameter scleral lens still pending . In addition , still understand lens effect high order aberration ocular surface structure . The purpose study analyze epidemiologic data treatment result patient fit specialty lens contact lens clinic Aug 2016 Aug 2018 . Patients categorized different group diagnose type lens wear . After 6 month follow , change visual acuity , visual function relate quality life , change ocular surface structure physiology analyze . The investigator hope share experience specialty contact lens fit understand effect long-term contact lens wear ocular surface .</detailed_description>
