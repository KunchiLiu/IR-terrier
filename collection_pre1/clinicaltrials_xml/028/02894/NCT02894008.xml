	<brief_title>A Study New Leishmania Vaccine Candidate ChAd63-KH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess safety new candidate Leishmania vaccine ChAd63-KH patient persistent post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) . With 95 % case occur India , Bangladesh , Nepal , Sudan Brazil , visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) disease poor . With estimate 40,000 death annually , mostly child young adult , VL rank second malaria amongst parasitic infection mortality , measure DALYs lose , rank top ten infectious disease globally . No effective vaccine yet develop VL / PKDL despite significant research effort . The investigator recently complete successful first-in-human clinical trial new therapeutic vaccine VL / PKDL ( ChAd63-KH ) . This trial demonstrate safety ChAd63-KH healthy UK adult volunteer immunogenicity two Leishmania antigen par see vaccine candidate antigen clinical development disease ( e.g . malaria , HCV , Ebola ) . Following external peer review data generate LEISH1 , investigator award Wellcome Trust funding progress vaccine Phase II clinical trial patient PKDL . Study design : The first eight adult volunteer receive 1x10 ( 10 ) vp , follow DSMB CTSC review , subsequent eight adult volunteer receive 7.5 x10 ( 10 ) vp . Doses administer single time point . Adolescents vaccinate either 1x10 ( 10 ) vp 7.5 x10 ( 10 ) vp , determine evaluation available data DSMB &amp; CTSC review . Aims : 1 . To compare humoral cellular immune response generate candidate vaccine patient persistent PKDL . 2 . To observe clinical change cutaneous PKDL disease 42 day period follow vaccination .</detailed_description>
