	<brief_summary>While previous atherosclerosis-related study focus mainly atherogenicity lipid , propose study aim investigate effect dietary factor , i.e . monosaccharide , disaccharide , amino acid , artificial sweetener , atherogenicity serum macrophage . Findings current propose study may shed light yet unknown mechanism dietary factor could affect atherosclerosis development CVD risk hence could possibly assist future development anti-atherogenic strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis underlie cause cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , major cause death worldwide . Atherosclerosis inflammatory disease artery activate macrophage abundant atherosclerotic lesion . Macrophages play key role early atherogenesis . After differentiate peripheral blood monocyte , form intimal macrophage take oxidized/modified lipoprotein transform lipid-rich foam cell , hallmark feature early atherogenesis . In addition lipoprotein uptake , lipid accumulation macrophage also result alteration cellular lipid metabolism , e.g . attenuated reverse lipid transport enhance rate lipid biosynthesis . CVD atherosclerosis development significantly affect nutritional factor . Although much progress make understanding role different lipid ( fatty acid , cholesterol , phospholipid triglyceride ) atherosclerosis development macrophage foam-cell formation , little known potential impact nutrient , i.e . sugar amino acid . For instance , hyperglycemia know enhance atherosclerosis development , high glucose level increase macrophage atherogenicity via pro-inflammatory oxidative stress-related mechanism . However , role monosaccharide glucose ( fructose , galactose mannose ) various disaccharide ( maltose , sucrose lactose ) macrophage foam-cell formation , key event early atherogenesis , currently unknown . As amino acid , specific subgroup - branched-chain amino acid ( BCAAs ) , recently associate increase CVD risk . The BCAA subgroup , compose leucine , isoleucine , valine , characterize aliphatic structure side chain common catabolic pathway . Recent report demonstrate association BCAAs , CVD coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Serum BCAA level positively associate various CAD risk factor development well severity CAD , even control risk factor . Nevertheless , role BCAAs atherosclerosis development macrophage foam-cell formation currently unclear . In recent decade , availability consumption various artificial sweetener increase considerably . In USA instance , approximately 30 % adult 15 % child , report consumption artificial sweetener . Although consumption artificial sweetener previously associate elevate risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , effect different artificial sweetener , e.g . saccharin , aspartame , sucralose , steviol , cyclamate , mannitol , atherosclerosis development possible impact macrophage foam-cell formation investigate yet..</detailed_description>
