	<brief_summary>This study evaluate role AZLI treatment acute pulmonary exacerbation CF . For consecutive exacerbation patient receive AZLI + IV Colistin , two IV anti-pseudomonals .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aztreonam Inhalation Solution ( AZLI ) Treatment Exacerbations Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZLI , market Cayston , inhale beta-lactam antibiotic . It license chronic suppression Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) . Current standard practice dictate use two IV antipseudomonal antibiotic treatment acute pulmonary exacerbation . The increase survival , hence population , CF mean new antimicrobial strategy require order manage antimicrobial resistance , minimise adverse systemic effect heavy antimicrobial exposure also make effective use resource . Inhaled antibiotic commonly use chronic suppression PA yet use thoroughly investigate acute pulmonary exacerbation . Inhaled antibiotic deliver drug directly target-site minimal systemic absorbance , make attractive candidate treatment acute exacerbation . Recently , become apparent bacterial community much complex initially think . The microbiome , term use describe polymicrobial community lung , become apparent due use modern culture-independent method detect bacteria . The microbiome change composition structure around time exacerbation response treatment , although change prospectively characterise . We design open-label randomise , control cross-over trial investigate clinical effectiveness AZLI treatment acute pulmonary exacerbation , whilst simultaneously compare effect inhale intravenous antibiotic microbiome .</detailed_description>
