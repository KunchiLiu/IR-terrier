	<brief_title>Evaluation Directional Recording Stimulation Using spiderSTN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) technique involve implant electrode use stereotactic method connect pulse generator deliver current localize area brain . The optimum location DBS electrode determine pre-operative brain imaging , often combine intraoperative microelectrode recording/stimulating ( MER ) sequence . Current MER practice involve insert micro-recording/stimulating electrode guide tubes brain lowering towards target , perform recording select step . The recording differ base type neuronal structure pass through.Based recording , promise location discriminate stimulation use macro-electrodes , target final lead placement choose . The spiderSTN lead ( Aleva Neurotherapeutics SA , Switzerland ) capable record stimulate inner out surface , allow user steer direction stimulation target location phase . This allow neurosurgeon great flexibility investigate balance therapeutic benefit stimulation-induced side effect give location . This feasibility study design explore effect directional stimulation ability differentiate stimulation induce side effect give location , DBS surgery . It propose patient suffer Parkinson disease ( PD ) essential tremor ( ET ) DBS indicate accord standard criterion hospital . It restrict limited number patient ( 10 ) , sufficient ass record stimulate capacity spiderSTN device . The patient undergo normal DBS surgery position final lead chosen . Then spiderSTN test phase take place . Once test phase complete , conventional DBS surgery resume .</detailed_description>
