	<brief_summary>The investigator retrospectively review radionuclide shuntographic test use ( 99m ) technetium-pertechnetate ( DTPA ) perform August 2005 December 2015 nuclear medicine department Far Eastern Memorial Hospital . The result shuntography evaluate visually qualitatively , correlate clinical follow-up . The test interpret normal abnormal , include complete distal obstruction , partial distal obstruction miscellaneous . Clinical outcome within 30 day define base subsequent need revision , re-implantation adjustment shunt pressure . Then investigator calculate sensitivity ( Se ) , specificity ( Sp ) , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) overall accuracy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cerebrospinal fluid ventriculoperitoneal ( V-P ) shunt often use treatment hydrocephalus . Complications shunt uncommon present variety sign symptom , could evaluate clinical examination neuro-imaging . The radionuclide cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) shunt study provide simple , effective , low-radiation-dose method assess CSF shunt patency . When discrepancy neurological examination imaging , additional radionuclide shuntography helpful . The purpose study analyze image finding clinical interpretation variety shuntography result determine applicability shuntography patient suspect shunt malfunction . Materials Methods : The investigator include radionuclide shuntographic test use ( 99m ) technetium-pertechnetate ( DTPA ) perform August 2005 December 2015 department . No complication discomfort note examination . The result shuntography evaluate visually qualitatively , correlate clinical follow-up . The test interpret normal abnormal , include complete distal obstruction , partial distal obstruction miscellaneous . Clinical outcome within 30 day define base subsequent need revision , re-implantation adjustment shunt pressure . Then investigator calculate sensitivity ( Se ) , specificity ( Sp ) , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) overall accuracy . The investigator would also determine correlation operative finding assessment radionuclide shuntography .</detailed_description>
