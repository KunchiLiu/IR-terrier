	<brief_summary>This prospective multicenter registry evaluate efficacy hybrid coronary revascularization ( HCR ) combine coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment multivessel coronary artery disease . CABG perform leave anterior descend artery leave circumflex artery use arterial graft , whereas PCI conduct treatment significant stenotic disease right coronary artery everolimus-eluting stent ( EESs ) . This research plan involve patient schedule coronary revascularization multivessel coronary artery disease consent participate registry .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients stable angina , unstable angina , nonST elevation myocardial infarction . Patients multivessel coronary artery disease include significant stenotic lesion* right coronary artery also include leave main stem disease . Patients refer CABG . Patients significant stenotic lesion right coronary artery amenable PCI . Patients take DAPT medication . Patients provide write informed consent . * Significant stenotic lesion mean condition fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) low 0.80 visually confirm stenosis least 75 % . • Patients ST elevation myocardial infarction occur within 24 hour enrollment . Patients previously underwent CABG . Patients high risk receive CABG . Patients need simultaneous surgery valve surgery CABG . Patients life expectancy 1 year shorter due comorbidities . Patients history cerebral infarction within last 6 month . Patients congestive cardiac failure NYHA 3 high . Patients unstable hemodynamics enrollment . Patients right coronary artery disease chronic total occlusion difficult treat PCI ( JCTO score ≥ 23 ) . Patients receive longterm dialysis . Patients allergic antiplatelet agent . Patients critically allergic contrast medium . Patients allergic DES component .</criteria>
