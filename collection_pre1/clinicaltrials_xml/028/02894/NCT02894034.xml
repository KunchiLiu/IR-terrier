	<brief_summary>Sub Arachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH ) public health concern high incidence ( 7/100 000 inhab . ) , mortality rate ( 25 % ) , morbidity rate ( 50 % ) . Prognostic tool indispensable guide optimize care patient . Some diagnostic factor identify ( e.g . age , comorbidities , ACSOS , GCS , ICP , occurrence complication ) well classification scheme use grade seriousness disease ( Hunt Hess , World Federation NeuroSurgery ) . A tool simple , reliable , reproducible , non costly , non invasive , simple perform ( include remote method without change plan patient care ) would ideal . The measurement Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter ( ONSD , ) correlate MRI ultrasound previous study , intra-cranial pressure ( ICP : fundamental prognostic factor SAH ) could one tool . This measurement , previously demonstrate use ultrasound , could carry time patient 's initial cerebral scan . In practice , admission patient undergoes cerebral CT scan much often ultrasound ( faster , less costly , less technical training require ) . Two preliminary study seem suggest measurement ONSD CTc predictive factor morbi-morbidity patient serious traumatic skull fractures.The measurement reliable , reproducible , non invasive , non costly , good sensitivity specificity . Proving also applicable SAH could particularly useful .</brief_summary>
