	<detailed_description>Postoperative pulmonary complication , PPCs common open heart surgery . The cause PPCs complex involve numerous factor cardiac surgery include general anesthesia , cardiopulmonary bypass technique , median sternotomy , internal mammary artery dissection , topical cool myocardial protection , process surgery , pulmonary risk factor patient preoperative intubation . These factor could lead pain change breathe pattern induce respiratory muscle dysfunction . Causes restriction lung volume , reduce lung volume , impaired airway clearance secretion accumulation lead poor ventilation gas exchange . These major contribute factor PPCs e.g . atelectasis pneumonia , increase load cardiac function . The cardio-respiratory dysfunction could result prolonged intubation mechanical ventilator dependence ICU important cause morbidity mortality . Also , PPCs increase use medical resource , extend length hospital stay increase hospital cost . The reduce PPCs need chest physical therapy ( CPT ) solve problem . The goal CPT increase lung volume , improve airway secretion clearance , improve physical ambulation movement . The CPT technique compose deep breathing exercise , cough huffing , force expiratory technique , percussion vibration , early mobilization change position . However , complication still available high incidence . May , CPT technique urge pain , clear secretion , patient enough time perform CPT technique preoperative period atelectasis occur immediately surgery . But CPT patient cardiac surgery mostly train extubation . So , CPT develop new technique breathe device increase lung volume improve airway secretion clearance without increase pain reduce incidence PPCs . Incentive spirometry ( IS ) device widely use prophylaxis treatment respiratory complication postsurgical patient . The previous study suggest IS train could reduce incidence PPCs . However , several publication controversisce result effectiveness IS compare chest physical therapy prevent PPCs patient undergo cardiac surgery . Recent study suggest patient undergo cardiac surgery evidence benefit IS prevent PPCs , improve pulmonary function oxygenation reduce length hospital compare preoperative education standard postsurgical physical therapy . The comparison effectiveness IS conventional postoperative chest physical therapy show difference . This may cause IS device study enough increase lung volume especially low lung , often find atelectasis . Moreover , device property airway clearance , secretion accumulation primary cause PPCs . Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) device popular use patient cardiac surgery practically demonstrate reduce incidence PPCs . Due , PEP technique prevent closure trachea exhalation , result increase lung volume mobilization secretion . Earlier study compare effect different deep breathing exercise , PPCs CABG surgery . However , study study immediate effect 30 deep breath perform without mechanical device atelectasis 2 day surgery , perform adequate follow-up . A resulting lack evidence indicate PEP technique clinical practice , patient undergo cardiac surgery . Due , routine treatment , breathe exercise repeat every daytime several day . It unlikely repeat practice substantial effect . Moreover , Westerdahl et al . ( 2003 ) find aerate lung area increase IS+PEP group , compare PEP deep breathe group . This data interesting point , patient practice breathe exercise IS+PEP 30 breathes every daytime several day maybe difference patient practice IS+PEP chest physical therapy incidence PPCs patient cardiac surgery . The study effect IS+PEP reduce incidence PPCs compare respiratory physiotherapy intervention patient undergoing cardiac surgery study . Westerdahl et al . ( 2001 ) study effectiveness three deep breathe technique male patient CABG surgery result find occurrence atelectasis statistical difference IS+PEP group , compare deep breath PEP group . This result contrastly result Haeffener et al. , ( 2008 ) . In patient undergo CABG surgery , combinated treatment IS EPAP help reduction PPCs significantly . However , study limitation methodology due patient comprehensive . Thus , study interested effect practice IS combine PEP reduce incidence PPCs , especially atelectasis patient undergo cardiac surgery BreatheMAXÂ® v.2 . Due , BreatheMAX develop manufactured Thailand , breathe device multiple function cheap price easy . Moreover , IS BreatheMAX humidify vibrate mechanism inhale , thus reduce viscosity secretion increase ability remove secretion without cause dry mouth . The obstruction secretion primary cause atelectasis patient undergoing cardiac surgery . But device manufacture abroad single function , make time use several function need multiple device . In order prevent PPCs , patient well trained CPT technique use postoperative period physiotherapist . However , clinical practice patient always admit hospital 1-2 day operation , enough time practice CPT technique . In addition , taught CPT technique may challenge redundant practice short time . To solve problem , illustrate CPT technique select direct toward airway clearance , alveolar recruitment effect also need few efficient technique feasible easily post-operative patient . Consequently , apart huff coughing , use proper breathing device would easier enjoy way practice acceptable vulnerable patient pre-operative period . IS PEP technique select therapeutic effect . However , evidence support effectiveness IS PEP techniques pre-operative continue post-operative period order prevent PPCs . The hypothesized scope patient learn technique well , operative period , PPCs reduce prevent could result prevent reduce incidence PPCs . Therefore , study aim evaluate effectiveness preoperative physical therapy program ( Oscillated PEP + Oscillated IS ) PPCs patient underwent cardiac surgery . In conclusion , research proposal study effectiveness Oscillated PEP Oscillated IS ( OPEP+OIS ) technique compare deep breathing exercise conduct pre-operative continue post-operative period incidence PPCs , especially atelectasis , length mechanical ventilator , length intubation , length ICU hospital stay .</detailed_description>
