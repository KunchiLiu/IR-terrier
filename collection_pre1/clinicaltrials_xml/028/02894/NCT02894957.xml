	<brief_summary>Rationale : No study examine effect varenicline `` gradual '' smoke cessation COPD smoker currently interested quit . Objective : To compare efficiency varenicline-assisted `` gradual '' vs. `` abrupt '' smoke cessation low-motivated COPD smoker Setting : Pulmonary outpatient clinic Design : Open , randomized pilot smoke cessation trial Participants : COPD smoker low motivation quit . Such low motivation define score ≤ 3 point observe 10 cm visual analog scale ( 0=non motivate ; 10=highly motivate ) . Interventions/procedures : Patients randomize either receive varenicline ( uptitrated 1 mg twice daily ) smoke reduction smoke usual 4-6 week quit . After quit-day , two group receive standard 12-week varenicline treatment . Non-treatment follow-up continue 6 month . Measurements : The main outcome measure carbon monoxide-verified complete abstinence rate ( CAR ) 6 month quit-day . Other measure : CAR 3 month ; point prevalence 3 6 month ; change motivation ; cigarettes/day ; differential dropout rate ; decline pulmonary function ; COPD symptom , episode exacerbation medication ; adverse event . Sample size : One hundred twenty-one subject per group necessary detect CAR difference two group 15 % 6 month . Potential study limitation : The main potential limitation lack 1-yr follow-up . Relevance : This study may provide useful preliminary information safety efficiency varenicline `` gradual '' smoke cessation low-motivated COPD smoker may assist preparation large , comprehensive trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Varenicline `` Gradual '' vs. `` Abrupt '' Smoking Cessation Low-motivated COPD Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) inflammatory disease characterize progressive airflow limitation fully reversible use bronchodilator .Cigarette smoke single common cause COPD . It estimate 15-20 % smoker develop COPD lifetime , high figure report old smoker . Incidentally , previous study show 20 % `` healthy '' smoker participate cessation trial might airway obstruction , unaware diagnosis . There single explanation fact fraction smoker develop COPD . Bronchodilator treatment improve symptom quality life COPD patient , new drug available purpose . Notwithstanding , smoke cessation remain therapeutic intervention likely slow progression disease prevent decline maximal expiratory flow . Thus , smoke cessation paramount treatment patient COPD . Although know smoking cause disease , many patient COPD continue smoke . Smoking prevalence rate 80 % documented patient mild moderate disease 50 % severe disease . Notwithstanding , various reason COPD patient resistant smoke cessation `` healthy '' smoker ; include high pack-year history strong nicotine dependence . In addition , COPD smokers less motivated quit often suffer depression , know cause failure quit attempt . These observation call new cessation strategy likely prompt COPD smoker attempt quit smoking . The standard way stop smoking quit abruptly designate quit-day . However , COPD patient , hard achieve since , , smoke source pleasure also longstanding habit , second nature . An alternative strategy so-called `` reduce-to-quit '' `` gradual '' cessation method . Although also quit-day , key difference smoker reduce number cigarettes/day several day week prior quit . To help smoker achieve maintain reduction , pharmacotherapy usually offer , many country , nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) license purpose . Surprisingly enough , study publish efficiency varenicline aid pre-quitting smoking reduction . Indeed , varenicline find superior single type NRT ( bupropion ) aid smoking cessation adult smoker . . Second , find efficient placebo NRT `` abrupt '' cessation COPD smoker motivate quit ] . Finally , varenicline find decrease pre-quit enjoyment general smoker increase motivation quit among healthy smoker willing make serious attempt quit smoking . RESEARCH QUESTION/OBJECTIVE With consideration mind , investigator set examine efficiency varenicline-assisted `` gradual '' vs. `` abrupt '' cessation COPD smoker low motivation quit . The investigator hypothesize , patient receive standard 12-week varenicline treatment , `` gradual '' cessation would produce high quit rate 6 month `` abrupt '' cessation varenicline use assist pre-treatment reduction . A secondary hypothesis varenicline-assisted pre-quitting smoking reduction would increase motivation quit compare usual smoking quitting . STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW When planning study , investigator first idea carry three-arm , double-blind , randomized trial . However , lack basic information reliable sample size calculation uncertainties participation rate guide towards preliminary , open , randomize pilot study COPD smoker low motivation quit . The patient recruit among attend outpatient clinic Pulmonary Institute Share Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem . Participants randomly assign receive varenicline smoke reduction smoke usual quitting . Thereafter two group receive standard varenicline treatment follow-up extend 6 month . PARTICIPANTS Participants heavy smoker ( ≥15 pack year ) sex , age ≥35 yr receive diagnosis COPD ( FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict ) low motivation quit smoking . Randomization procedure Eligible participant computer-randomized either `` gradual '' `` abrupt '' cessation group baseline visit . Blinding The study open participant medical team aware treatment . INTERVENTION AND PROCEDURES Gradual cessation Patients randomize `` gradual '' cessation group receive varenicline ( 0,5 mg daily 3 day , 0,5 mg twice daily 4 day , 1,0 mg bid thereafter ) aid smoking reduction . This pre-treatment phase last 6 week end participant must stop smoking altogether . However , patient allow quit already week 4 feel ready . After quit , participant continue receive varenicline 1,0 mg bid 12 week . Smoking reduction : Participants recommend reduce smoke 25 % first two week , 50 % week 3-4 , 75 % week 5-6 ; however , give indication every subject allow chose his/her goal rate progress . To achieve reduction participant offer three structured way : ) Scheduled reduction ( SR ) , gradually increase time cigarette ( inter-cigarette interval ) ; b ) Hierarchical reduction - easy first , rating cigarette term difficult would give eliminate turn , start easy one ; c ) Hierarchical reduction - hardest first : similar previous one subject must start hard give cigarette first . Abrupt cessation Patients group ask smoke usual 6 week enrolment stop altogether . However , feel ready allow quit week 4 . Thereafter , participant receive standard 12-week varenicline treatment , start 1 week titration period describe . Visits Follow-up Ten visit schedule : study entry week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 24 30 . Support Only minimal level advice support give . However , subject receive individualize verbal instruction regard general conduct study proper use study medication .</detailed_description>
