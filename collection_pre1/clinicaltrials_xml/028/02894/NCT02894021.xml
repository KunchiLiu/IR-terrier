	<brief_summary>Lymphoceles , seromas , frequent complication follow mastectomy associate axillary dissection occur 10 90 % case . It define presence palpable post operative serous accumulation bothersome patient require puncture drainage even several repeat puncture . The presence seromas therefore associate discomfort pain . Seromas could also responsible increase morbidity due complication infection , suture separating , lymphedema , prolong hospital stay , delay initiation adjunct treatment ( e.g . chemotherapy , radiotherapy ) . Some risk factor identify , obesity , increase post operative drainage J1 J3 , arterial hypertension . Different measure demonstrate benefit limit axillary lymphoceles dissection : placement drain , pad delay shoulder mobility . Studies show axillary padding decrease lymphocele development shortens length hospital stay . Some study base pad mastectomy site also show decrease post operative seromas ; however study do usefulness pad mastectomy site alone include pad drain pad axillary area . The padding technique investigator employ perform donor site breast reconstruction latissimus dorsi muscle flap , demonstrate reduction rate seromas . In study , classic technique compare pad mastectomy site short drainage ( 48h ) .</brief_summary>
