	<brief_summary>A novel magnetic resonance ( MR ) compatible accelerometer respiratory motion sensing ( MARMOT ) develop surrogate vendor ' pneumatic belt . The aim model correct respiratory motion free-breathing thoracic-abdominal MR image simplify patient installation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MR Compatible Accelerometer Respiratory MOTion Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory motion serious problem acquisition high-quality thoracic/abdominal magnetic resonance ( MR ) image . Various method propose compensate motion-induced artefact , include breathholding , respiratory gate model-driven motion correction . Breath-holding simplest among three . However conventional clinical method induces various problem , include inefficient use scanner , inconsistent organ position breath-hold , image alter physiological status patient inconvenience especially suffer respiration difficulty . Free-breathing MR acquisition therefore become great clinical interest recently . The investigator intend examine efficacy MARMOT sensor : - model predict respiratory motion abdominal scan , - correct respiratory motion cardiac cine scan , via reconstruction-based method .</detailed_description>
