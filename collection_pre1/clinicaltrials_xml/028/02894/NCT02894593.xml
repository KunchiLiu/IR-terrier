	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate antiplaque effect alcohol-free essential-oil containing mouthrinse - Listerine Zero ( LZ ) alcohol-based essential oil ( EO+ ) mouthwash compare positive control 0.20 % chlorhexidine ( CHX ) mouthwash , negative control placebo solution ( saline ) , use vivo plaque regrowth model 3 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alcohol-free Essential Oils Containing Mouthrinse Efficacy 3-day Supragingival Plaque Regrowth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plaque biofilm microorganism responsible development caries periodontal disease . The daily removal supragingival dental plaque represent major factor prevention caries , gingivitis periodontitis . Plaque control largely obtain daily effective tooth brush inter-dental cleaning , case plaque removal improve add use mouthwash . An effective action chemical formulation ( especially antiseptic ) control plaque gingivitis level prove . Most mouthwash contain alcohol ( especially ethanol ) order act carrier agent active essential oil penetrate plaque , give subject `` clean mouth sensation '' . The alcohol content mouthwash , besides antiseptic property , serf purpose break dissolve active principle , addition preserve formula component , although content directly contribute effective biofilm gingivitis control . However , contraindication use alcohol-based mouthwash , like use infant , pregnant woman , alcohol addict patient mucosal injury . There also undesirable effect , like burn sore sensation , painful sensation patient exist soft tissue injury , perception dryness mouth . In order avoid use alcohol-based mouthwash particular condition , scientific interest become widespread introducing mouthrinse strong anti-plaque quality alcoholic ingredient . One product alcohol-free essential oil mouthwash Listerine Zero ( LZ ) , little documentation regard anti-plaque effect . The aim study evaluate antiplaque effect alcohol-free essential oil mouthwash ( Listerine Zero , LZ ) alcohol-based essential oil mouthwash ( EO+ ) , compare positive control 0.2 % chlorhexidine mouthwash ( CHX ) , negative control placebo solution ( saline ) , use vivo plaque regrowth model 3 day . The study design double-masked , randomize , crossover clinical trial , involve 21 volunteer compare four different mouthwash , use 3-day plaque regrowth model . After receive thorough professional prophylaxis baseline , next 3 day , volunteer refrain oral hygiene measure perform two daily rinse 15 ml test mouthwash . EO+ compare LZ . CHX rinse serve positive control , placebo solution negative control . At end experimental period , plaque index ( PI ) assess , panelist complete visual analogue scale ( VAS ) questionnaire evaluate organoleptic property product . Each subject underwent 14-day washout period , another allocation .</detailed_description>
