	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) high incidence associate high case fatality . In France , 5-year survival , pool across cancer stage diagnosis , range 57 % men 60 % woman . About one third patient diagnose CRC develop metachronous recurrence follow year . It paramount importance accurately identify factor associate increase risk progression death , order develop effective follow-up treatment strategy . However , accurately assess role patient ' specific characteristic progression cancer several methodological challenge need overcome . One difficulty , common prognostic study cancer , concern need separate effect prognostic factor different clinical endpoint , disease recurrence vs recurrence-free death . Another difficulty , encounter prognostic study , cause death available accurately cod . Yet , patient likely die cause related disease primary interest , especially cancer longer survival affect old subject . Until recently , exist statistical methodology able simultaneously , deal difficulty , i.e . account ( ) possibly different effect prognostic factor death v recurrence , ( ii ) unknown cause death . However , challenge addressed recent development Markov relative survival model ( MRS ) , extend Markov multi-state model incorporate relative survival modelling . Simulations demonstrate MRS able accurately estimate different effect prognostic factor risk several event , include separate effect disease-specific vs cause death . To date , MRS apply clinical epidemiological study . The aim study assess potential advantage new multi-state relative survival model ( MRS ) , propose Huszti et al . ( 2012 ) , prognostic cancer study . To end , compare MRS result obtain two conventional analysis , base Cox 's proportional hazard model , multi-state Markov model propose Alioum Commenges ( 2001 ) . The three model apply explore impact prognostic factor cancer-specific mortality recurrence , large population-based French registry colorectal cancer , 25 year follow-up .</brief_summary>
