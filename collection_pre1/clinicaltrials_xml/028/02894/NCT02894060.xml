	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease link atherosclerosis ( e.g . infarct , cerebro-vascular accident ) one main cause mortality general population . The recruitment macrophages wall arterial lumen follow unregulated capture oxidate LDL ( LDLox ) lead accumulation cholesterol ester formation foamy cell characteristic fatty streak , first phase atherogenesis . These fatty streak rarely follow clinical event , progress complicate atheromatoses ( calcification , rupture ) result occurrence various clinical event myocardial infarction cerebro-vascular accident ( CVA ) . Once oxidate , LDL become immunogenic induces anti-LDLox antibody production could markers progression atherosclerosis . During LDL oxidation , multitude specific oxidative epitope ( SOE ) oxidate phospholipid ( PLox ) malondialdehyde-lysine epitope ( MDA ) generate . In order measure level marker blood , researcher develop series immunologic level vitro , use specific antibody direct well-defined epitope . Recently , show Lp ( ) would prefer transporter PLox . In fact , several clinical study show strong correlation PLox/apoB concentration Lp ( ) . This marker ( PLox/apoB ) predict future morbidity mortality due cardiovascular disease , include CVA , 15 year advance , independent know risk factor . CD36 scavenger receptor recognize LDLox , specifically PLox present lipoprotein .One soluble form inflammatory CD36 ( sCD36 ) recently identify . In study , healthy volunteer recruit order able establish normal serum range different immunologic biomarkers .</brief_summary>
