	<brief_title>Efficacy/Quality Life Study Postmenop . Women With Advanced Breast Cancer , Treated With Letrozol Palbociclib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , multi-center , single arm , non-comparative phase II study postmenopausal woman HR+/HER2- advance breast cancer receive palbociclib addition letrozole . The study take place two country , Austria ( 5 study center ) Germany ( 40 study center ) . In total , 120 patient enrol study . The study seek recruit 60 ( 58-62 ) patient first-line treatment ( Enrollment Group 1 ) 60 ( 58-62 ) patient second- later-line treatment ( Enrollment Group 2 ) palbociclib letrozole . Recruitment centrally monitor allow closure respective group soon 60 ( 58-62 ) patient enrol . Treatment continue disease progression , intolerable toxicity , death reason . In case letrozole discontinue , palbociclib discontinue . In case treatment palbociclib stop , letrozole continue accord investigator 's discretion . Irrespectively letrozole , discontinuation palbociclib define end treatment ( EOT ) study . After EOT , patient enters follow-up period . Primary end point clinical benefit response 24 week first study treatment patient . A study independent , decentral , `` virtual '' biobank establish . All patient ask give consent tumor sample use future investigational research . Study sit inform local pathologist patient 's consent ask tissue sample reserve future analysis . The site request collect contact detail pathologist store tumor sample , sample 's identification number ( ) , document eCRF . The decision perform subsequent investigational research study collect sample base outcome data study new scientific finding relate drug class disease , well reagent assay availability .</detailed_description>
