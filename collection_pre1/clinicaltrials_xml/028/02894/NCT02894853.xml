	<brief_summary>We hypothesize early molecular profiling , include tissue blood-bases analysis , NSCLC patient , include stage I-III , increase diagnostic efficiency . When molecular profile available early stage disease , patient benefit personalized therapy need . This result well quality life outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Cancer Early Molecular Assessment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prospective multicentre trial tumour patient present NSCLC profile upfront , irrespective disease stage pathology use tissue blood-based genetic testing . A minimal molecular profiling depict target include due time . The study divide two part . In first part participate centre run-in period half year molecular profiling perform currently standard care . This period use measure impact increase awareness diagnostic process . During second part study comprehensive upfront profile accord local standard take place NSCLC patient . Liquid ( blood ) biopsy include order increase diagnostic yield patient tissue biopsy adequate . Patients treat accord standard care , include clinical study appropriate . Re-biopsies ( tissue liquid ) advocate time establish disease progression/disseminated disease , personalize therapy initiate accord exist data molecular profiling .</detailed_description>
