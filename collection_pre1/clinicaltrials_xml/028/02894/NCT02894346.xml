	<detailed_description>Introduction According research positive link physical activity academic performance child young people , mean exercise benefit physical health well-being , also cognition performance learn context . However , develop engage physical activity ( PA ) require motivation importantly research show people intrinsically motivate likely engage PA consistently . When integrate PA school context role teacher become crucial , teacher responsible develop carry qualified PA activity . It therefore important understand underlie factor motivation - especially teacher ' motivation use PA tool learning . There potential barrier integrate PA learn context . A recent study University Southern Denmark suggest teacher willing implement PA , , always , meaningful use school set tool learning . Furthermore , number teacher believe PA PE activity positive impact concentration learning , however , find hard integrate carry qualify PA activity suitable learn objective school lesson . The study also suggest implement PA tool learn depends much teacher know didactics relation use PA. With implementation The Danish School Reform 2014 , PA become mandatory part school day , state child must engage least 45 minute daily activity . The 45 minute must either part pupil learn process separately subject lesson . It , however , state reform kind activity , intensity , time school day PA must carry . The reform therefore open interpretation perceive teacher many way . As consequence school teacher carry 45 minute daily activity differently - base lack information Reform , also base experience knowledge PA . It therefore important examine understand teacher support process use PA tool learn particular focus frame learn process use theory Scaffolding approach . Over aim 1 ) Analyse teacher ' underlying factor motivation use PA learn tool use The Self Determination Theory ( SDT ) , 2 ) analyse support teacher ' motivation use theory scaffolding . This objective investigate follow research question : - What type motivation structure pattern The Self-Determination Theory occur use PA tool learn ? - How element didactics , learn environment professional identification important furthermore relate teacher ' motivation ? - How motivation support framed use theory scaffold ? The goal : 1 ) Reach systematic view understand motivation analyse affect teacher ' use PA tool learning ; 2 ) understand maintain support motivation ; 3 ) offer new scientifically base knowledge work PA school context particularly teacher responsible develop engaging PA ; 4 ) offer teacher insight motivation towards PA. Self-Determination Theory As tool analyse pattern structure motivation The Self-Determination Theory ( SDT ) use . The SDT highly suitable analyse underlying factor motivation within individual , use start point understanding element teacher ' motivation - intrinsically extrinsically . According Deci Ryan , develop model , human motivation base three innate psychological need : competence , autonomy relatedness . In theory distinction self-determined autonomous control type motivation offer way measure structure pattern related teacher motivation focus motivation psychological process . These different type motivation ( autonomous control ) reflect individual reason participate activity : autonomous define engage activity perceive consistent intrinsic goal . In contrast , control mean engage activity external reason reward approval others . The model offer four type extrinsic motivation : external , introjected , identify integrate . These four type extrinsic motivation view motivation process external internal regulation . Using four type extrinsic motivation , possible understand kind motivation pattern structure occur use PA furthermore enable nuanced look teacher ' intrinsic extrinsic motivation use PA tool learning . Scaffolding motivation- learning process By use element scaffold theory , examine support maintain motivation learn process PA implement . The method originally develop way examine child 's learning process , however , previous research area , find scaffold teacher equally important scaffold child learn process - especially learn process new . The approach method scaffold basically way frame support learn process divide six level . Wood , Bruner Ross point learning process require sort scaffold competent person offer support learn process use appropriate amount structure guidance . By use method , possible point support teacher process develop integrate PA furthermore point , base finding SDT , support importantly maintain teacher motivation use PA tool learn . In sense teacher view learner undergoing learning process . Inspired Russian psychologist Lev Vygotski 's theory The Zone Proximal Development , Wood , Bruner &amp; Ross identify six level scaffold . The six level : 1 ) Recruitment - gain interest learner ; 2 ) Reduction degree freedom - simplifying task ; 3 ) Direction maintenance - keep learner track ; 4 ) Marking critical feature - mark relevant irrelevant part task ; 5 ) Frustration control - offer support guidance ; 6 ) Demonstration - show learner solution . Research design The research design Ph.D. project use mixed method base method mention . Applying different type quantitative qualitative method , possible examine analyse objective different angle make sure point data saturation reach time answer aim research question . This Ph.D. project contain comparative study , instead focus gain deep insight stake regard teacher ' motivation implementation Danish School Reform . 1 . A thorough literature review base current national international literature carry . This conducted accordance key research question project . 2 . Survey : A survey provide basic knowledge teacher ' motivation furthermore give opportunity define teacher ' motivation base SDT . The questionnaire distribute minimum 500 teacher Denmark , select variety Danish Public Schools base follow criterion : Size , location , socio-demographics . The sample consist key respondent ( teacher ) potentially provide data make possible answer main objective Ph.D. project time make sure maximum variation obtain . Teachers therefore select base follow differentiation , teacher category need : Age , gender , subject , class experience . The questionnaire base The Work Task Motivation Scale Teachers ( WTMST ) . 3 . Based knowledge gain questionnaire , define select teacher motivate in-depth interview conduct 10 teacher . The sample consist teacher show different level intrinsic extrinsic motivation accordance SDT pick survey .</detailed_description>
