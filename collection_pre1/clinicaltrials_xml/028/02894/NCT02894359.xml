	<brief_summary>Cervical dystonia ( CD ) syndrome characterize sustain and/or phasic involuntary neck muscle activity cause abnormal head posture movement . It frequent form adult focal dystonia . The distribution dystonic muscle unique patient , explain variety pattern encounter . The therapeutic management CD essentially local symptomatic : Botulinum Neurotoxin injection and/or specific retrain therapy programme . Therefore , analyze characteristic abnormal head movement identify dystonic muscle key point treatment . To well understanding posture movement disorder head neck , wish establish three-dimensional ( 3-D ) computer model cervical spine movement ten healthy subject build image obtain `` Cone Beam `` system . Then compare cervical posture movement ten CD patient match age genre computer model . Comparison patient ' image axial plane reconstruct computer 3-D computer model lead description various pattern CD . Analysis musculoskeletal disturbance CD help improve localization Botulinum Neurotoxin injection sit well retrain programme .</brief_summary>
