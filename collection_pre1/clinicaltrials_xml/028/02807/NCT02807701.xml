	<detailed_description>Open pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) standard treatment wide array periampullary pancreatic disease include malignant benign condition . The outcome PD improve last two decade due advance surgical technique , anesthesia perioperative care . Although study high volume center demonstrate reduce operative mortality le 3 % , postoperative morbidity rate still range 30 % 60 % . Laparoscopic surgery use increasingly less invasive alternative traditional intervention pancreatic resection . Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy ( LPD ) difficult procedure become increasingly popular . Nevertheless , comparative data outcome remain limited despite several improvement surgical device technique allow surgeon approach pancreas laparoscopically , laparoscopic PD remain challenge . LPD represent one advanced abdominal operation owe necessity complex dissection reconstruction . Recent report note complete laparoscopic PD include laparoscopic resection reconstruction technically feasible safe . In prospective randomized study , investigator evaluate safety feasibility surgical oncological outcome minimally invasive PD compare conventional open PD</detailed_description>
