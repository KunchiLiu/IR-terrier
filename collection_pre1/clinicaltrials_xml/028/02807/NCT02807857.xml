	<brief_summary>This low interventional study , whose unique intervention measure blood level biomarker call NT-proBNP chronic heart failure patient daily followed-up Primary Care Physicians ( PCPs ) Europe , assess cardiologist referral guide NT-proBNP measurement patient currently judge PCPs stable , lead optimization HF treatment , define adherence treatment recommendation current European Society Cardiology guideline treatment heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Evaluation Natriuretic Peptide Based Referral CHF Patients Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In majority European country , primary management chronic heart failure patient perform General Practitioners collaboration cardiologist ( specialist ) . Previous study show many patient suffer CHF receive optimal pharmacological and/or device treatment disease . An increase natriuretic peptide ( BNP , NT-proBNP ) associate increase risk cardiovascular event heart failure patient . The purpose present study assess referral clinical stable chronic heart failure patient reduce ventricular ejection fraction ( EF &lt; = 40 % ) NT-proBNP level &gt; = 600 pg/mL specialist ( cardiologist ) lead treatment optimization , define adherence treatment recommendation accord European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline . In addition , data obtain study use describe demographic , clinical ( include NT-proBNP level ) treatment characteristic CHF patient manage primary care set across Europe..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willing able provide write informed consent accept study procedure time schedule . Age ≥ 18 year . Patients suffer chronic heart failure ( heart failure diagnosis must make confirmed cardiologist and/or hospital physician time patient 's medical history ) . Patients reduced ejection fraction ( ≤ 40 % ) confirm time point patient 's medical history . Use investigational drug either within 5 halflives enrollment , within 30 day , expect pharmacodynamic effect return baseline , whichever longer . Major surgery last 3 month prior baseline plan major surgery cardiac intervention study . Cancer significant comorbidities imply patient 's condition unstable . Comorbidities associate elevated natriuretic peptide ( NP ) level : renal insufficiency , ( eGFR &lt; 25 ml/min/1.73 m² calculate accord MDRD formula ) , recent ( less 3 month ) cerebral trauma recent ( less 3 month ) cerebrovascular incident , novel diagnosis acute exacerbation COPD within last 3 month . Patients primarily manage regularly followedup cardiologist HF Highly frail patient whose estimate lifespan due comorbidities judgement investigator le 6 month .</criteria>
