A healthy military cohort randomly assign either perform pushup consistent army physical fitness score , take blinded oral medication NSAID ( ibuprofen ) oral placebo . The study require three visit assessment : day vaccine receipt , 48-72 hour later 21 -28 day later . The assessment visit include injection site inspection , injection site photograph , completion symptom diary validate pain scale laboratory blood specimen first third visit measure antibody level change . The exercise participant also require provide 1-2 fingerstick blood sample evaluate lactate , byproduct anaerobic exercise measure level exercise effort achieve anaerobic metabolism . The study evaluate either intervention impact perceived delayed pain , physical sign inflammation antibody response measure serology .</detailed_description>
