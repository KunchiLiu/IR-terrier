	<brief_summary>A Phase 2 study investigate antitumor activity term overall response rate ( ORR ) tipifarnib approximately 20 eligible subject CMML . Subjects receive tipifarnib administer orally , twice day ( bid ) 7 day alternate week ( Days 1-7 15-21 ) 28 day cycle . In absence unmanageable toxicity , subject may continue receive tipifarnib treatment disease progression . If complete response observe , therapy tipifarnib maintain least 6 month beyond start response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study investigate antitumor activity term ORR tipifarnib approximately 20 eligible subject CMML . This trial plan single treatment trial statistical comparison historical ORR rate . The primary objective provide evidence TRUE underlie ORR subject and/or KRAS/NRAS wild-type subgroup exceed historical rate . Only consented subject meet eligibility criterion enrol study . Eligible subject receive tipifarnib administer start dose 1200 mg , orally food , bid 7 day alternate week ( Days 1-7 15-21 ) 28 day cycle . Stepwise 300 mg dose reduction control treatment-related , treatment-emergent toxicity allow . If complete response observe , therapy tipifarnib maintain least 6 month beyond start response . In absence unmanageable toxicity , subject may continue receive tipifarnib treatment disease progression . Provisions make continuation study treatment subject whose disease progress beyond end study , e.g . single patient treatment protocol . Determination disease response perform Investigator accord MDS/MPN IWG criterion . Similarly , disease progression also determine base MDS/MPN IWG criterion . Upon disease progression , subject follow approximately every 12 week survival use subsequent therapy either death 12 month accrual study cohort complete , whichever occur first . Information survival subsequent anticancer therapy may collect phone .</detailed_description>

Subjects stable dose hydroxyurea least 2 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 may continue hydroxyurea Cycle 1 Day 7 . Subjects must recover NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 &lt; Grade 2 acute toxicity ( exclude Grade 2 toxicity consider safety risk Sponsor Investigator ) toxicity must deem irreversible Investigator . Acceptable liver function : 1 . Total direct bilirubin ≤ 2 time upper limit normal ( x ULN ) ; apply subject Gilbert 's syndrome diagnose per institutional guideline . 2 . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Acceptable renal function serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min use CockcroftGault Modification Diet Renal Disease formula . Female subject must : 1 . Of nonchildbearing potential ( surgically sterilize least 2 year postmenopausal ) ; 2 . If childbearing pIf childbearing potential , subject must use adequate method contraception consist twobarrier method one barrier method spermicide intrauterine device . Both female male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception 2 week prior screen , , least 4 week last dose study medication . Female subject must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start study medication . 3 . Not breast feed time study . Written voluntary inform consent understood , sign date . Known prior progression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) define least 20 % blast blood bone marrow . Myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome CMML . CMML ( 5 ; 12 ) yet receive imatinib . Participation interventional study within 4 week randomization 5 halflives prior treatment agent ( whichever longer ) . Ongoing treatment anticancer agent CMML contemplate protocol . Subjects stable dose hydroxyurea least 2 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 may continue hydroxyurea Cycle 1 Day 7 . Concurrent use granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor ( GMCSF ) . Prior treatment ( least 1 full treatment cycle ) farnesyltransferase inhibitor . Active coronary artery disease require treatment , myocardial infarction within prior year , New York Heart Association grade III great congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular attack within prior year , current serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication except atrial fibrillation . Major surgery , diagnostic surgery , within 2 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 , without complete recovery . Active , concurrent malignancy require radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer , adjuvant hormonal therapy breast cancer hormonal treatment castration sensitive prostate cancer ) . Active uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection , require systemic therapy . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active infection hepatitis B hepatitis C. Concomitant disease condition could interfere conduct study , would , opinion investigator , pose unacceptable risk subject study . The subject legal incapacity limited legal capacity .
