The result screen data collect study record subject 's Case Report Form . MedDRA Data dictionary use adverse event determination normal laboratory range add ITF . Standardized CRFs use document subject ' data course study . The investigator assure data enter promptly , legibly , completely , accurately accordance source document . This also apply data subject -after consent participate -underwent baseline examination require especially inclusion study - criterion exclusion meet reason - include study . The Sponsor require top ( original ) copy CRF Investigator also leave copy trial file . Each page CRF must sign ( co- ) Investigator . A stamp signature allow . Any correction case report form must carry investigator designate . A single line must draw original entry , make sure previous data totally obliterate . The reason correction give date initialled .

Thereafter , CRFs correct , applicable . CRFs send post personally submit monitor visit . All medical record upon case report form base must keep least 5 year completion study . At time discuss Sponsor whether storage require long period . It responsibility investigator assure study conduct accordance protocol valid data enter CRF . Monitoring audit study conduct accordance SOPs ( IDEAL-BE-S08-1 , IDEAL-BE-S08-2 IDEAL-BE-S08-3 ) develop IDEAL order check adherence protocol compliance Good Clinical Practice guideline ensure international acceptability study data . In support measure , investigator make record available ALPAN , IDEAL Sponsor upon request reasonable time . Case report form check completeness clarity . Data verification legally require do direct comparison source document case subject 's respective consent cross-checking source document presence investigator - always give due consideration data protection medical confidentiality . In respect investigator assure ALPAN IDEAL support time . The investigator permit representative ALPAN , IDEAL Sponsor monitor study frequently necessary determine data record protocol adherence satisfactory . The CRFs related document review detail accordance SOPs IDEAL ( IDEAL-BE-S08-1 , IDEAL-BE-S08-2 IDEAL-BE-S08-3 ) Good Clinical Practice regulation . Visits may conduct also representative ALPAN , IDEAL Sponsor suitable interval throughout study . These visit purpose verify adherence protocol completeness exactness data enter Case Report Forms . The Sponsor allow get information state study . Case Report Forms transport investigator via IDEAL Sponsor completion trial . In fulfilment obligation Sponsor verify compliance protocol , ALPAN IDEAL require investigator permit monitor review portion subject 's primary medical record directly concern study . It investigator 's obligation assure documentation relevant data subject 's file , medical history / concomitant disease , date study enrolment , visit date , result examination , administration medication adverse event . The investigator affirm uphold principle subject 's right protection invasion privacy . Throughout study , data identify volunteer number . The data blind correspondingly data analysis . In order guarantee performance study accordance GCP provision , in-house , need , on-site audit may carry . The auditor independent staff involve proceeding clinical study . The investigator agree give auditor access relevant document review . The applies case inspection local national authority . After every on-site audit investigator receive audit confirmation auditor . This file together study documentation make available local authority case supervision . At end study , audit certificate include final report . Safety Monitoring : Adverse event question examination do every visit . Evaluation Criteria : Primary Endpoints : - Difference baseline Imuneks 10 mg Capsules immunological examination ( lymphocyte , macrophage , neutrophil , eosinophil monocyte ) - Proportion subject symptoms cold ( cold see first week exclude evaluation prophylactic effect assessable period ) Secondary Endpoint : • Number Subjects Reporting Side Effects number subject take rest period treatment period . Plan miss data : Subjects prematurely withdraw treatment trial replace . Missing value efficacy parameter include evaluation . Missing value treat use list wise deletion method . All computation perform commercial statistical software SPSS® , SAS® WinNonlin® . Microsoft Excel may use tabulation data description statistic . Graphical summary present SAS® WinNonlin® format . A detailed description analysis perform provided statistical analysis plan . Statistical Considerations : Populations Analysis : Intent-to Treat ( ITT ) population primary analysis population . Per Protocol ( PP ) Population supportive analysis population analysis . The descriptive statistic : Arithmetic mean ( MEAN ) , standard deviation ( SD ) , coefficient variation ( % CV ) , maximal value ( MAX ) , minimal value ( MIN ) , median value ( MEDIAN ) apply applicable demographic immunological data present table . Efficacy Analysis : Primary Endpoints evaluate either pair t-tests Wilcoxon signed-rank test two-group comparison . Repeated measure ANOVA Friedman test apply two-group comparison . All p value two-tailed ; p &lt; 0.05 denote statistical significance .
