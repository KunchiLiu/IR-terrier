	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate frailty patient age â‰¥ 65 year cancer . The elderly population heterogeneous , necessary evaluate elderly patient treatment assess risk-benefit balance . To date , assessment relies subjective clinical method often optimal , slow implement . An innovative method evaluation could determination elastin peptide . Indeed , rate peptide , link serious condition associate age , rise inexorably age dose could help determine objectively type treatment offer old patient . Expected result : This study allow good identification group frail elderly relevant biological marker clinical assessment , often subjective available within period compatible treatment newly diagnose cancer . This biological assessment also enable optimal management elderly patient particular allow geriatrician good efficiency .</brief_summary>
