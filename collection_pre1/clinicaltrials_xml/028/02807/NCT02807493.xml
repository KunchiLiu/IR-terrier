Past study publish dental literature show specially design oral appliance support dental occlusion may increase isometric strength different muscle group . Increased strength neck muscle could improve efficiency Valsalva maneuver increase intra-uterine pressure , thus decrease duration phase II labor . Nulliparous woman uncomplicated singleton pregnancy randomly assign either study group ( Dental appliance ) dental appliance group . Duration labor measure phase I phase II . Rates cesarean section instrument delivery complication chart well Apgar score .</detailed_description>
