	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well abiraterone acetate , niclosamide , prednisone work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cell . Hormone therapy use abiraterone acetate may fight prostate cancer lower amount androgen body make . Niclosamide drug may block another signal cause prostate cancer cell growth . Prednisone drug help lessen inflammation . Giving abiraterone acetate , niclosamide , prednisone may better treatment patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate , Niclosamide , Prednisone Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response 50 % reduction baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response determine Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criterion ( PCWG2 ) . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival CRPC patient treat PDMX1001/niclosamide ( niclosamide ) , abiraterone ( abiraterone acetate ) prednisone . III . To assess toxicity PDMX1001/niclosamide , abiraterone prednisone give combination . IV . To evaluate molecular correlative patient response outcome analysis patient baseline tumor specimen ( diagnostic biopsy ) along serial blood specimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) day ( QD ) , niclosamide PO twice day ( BID ) prednisone PO BID . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
