	<brief_summary>This project develop test use service robot track health elderly time . The objective develop low-cost mobile manipulator capable limited set elder- relevant manipulation task ( e.g . picking drop item ) . The investigator visualize model use service robot deployment elder care facility . Feedback focus group elder clinician inform necessary engineering innovation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal develop three stage new affordable robot participation Living Independently Elders ( LIFE ) member clinician . The robot develop multidisciplinary team head Dr. Yim UPENN ( PI ) , Dr. Lau Savioke , Drs . Johnson Cacchionne UPENN PM &amp; R UPENN Nursing , respectively . The aim build low-cost robot platform focus simple , key , repetitive , data-driven task robot well . Rather attempt create robot helper mimic human , aim free human caregiver time-consuming task robot accomplish facility , thereby allow human focus task human best ( i.e . human contact ) . Participatory review develop prototype complete stage ( year ) LIFE member clinician . There three research question investigator hope answer build effective system synergistically satisfy business need : R1 ) Although activity daily live ( ADLs ) elder health previously document categorize , research do characterize perspective feasibility automation use affordable mobile manipulation robot . How known ADLS characterize accord much would benefit robotic assistance give vary level robot capability ( mobility , limited manipulation , full manipulation ) ? R2 ) A manipulator arm must safe , affordable , performant enough assist ADLs elder heath . What new breakthrough require develop new manipulation technology satisfy constraint ? ? R3 ) A data-driven service robotics What concomitant key usability acceptance service feature require system potential affect elder health positive way . How predictive service robotics best use maintain improve elder health ? Which specific robot behavior impact elder ' well-being ?</detailed_description>
