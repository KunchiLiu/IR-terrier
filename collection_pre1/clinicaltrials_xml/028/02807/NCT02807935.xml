	<brief_summary>The purpose current series study evaluate different glaucoma treatment vivo effect conventional outflow pathway , specifically Schlemm 's canal ( SC ) anatomy use Enhanced Depth Imaging ( EDI ) -optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The image take part patient routine medical follow ( start treatment , 1,4 12 week afterwards ) diameter , cross-sectional area volume measure use commercially available 3-dimensional reconstruction . The series study divide 3 branch , branch contains different treatments.For treatment different patient recruit . The branch following- 1 . The surgical branch- 1 . Before trabeculotomy 2 . Before cataract surgery 3 . Before vitrectomy surgery 4 . Before XENâ„¢ Gel Stent implant 2 . The pharmacological branch- 1 . Before treatment prostaglandin analogs 2 . Before treatment alpha blocker 3 . Before treatment beta blocker 4 . Before treatment carbonic anhydrase inhibitor 3 . The laser branch- 1 . Before trabeculoplasty 2 . Before laser iridotomy 3 . Before yag capsulotomy laser</brief_summary>
