In child , study investigate salivary cytokine ( sCK ) suggest associate oral health ( sCK ) . One study investigate sCK adult oncology patient show association Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) severity oral chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) survivor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Therefore determination sCK concentration may also helpful assessment GVHD activity inflammatory process cancer patient . In pediatric oncology patient , investigator ' knowledge , study far investigated sCK concentration marker oral systemic health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral complication common cancer treatment . Oral mucositis typically occur immediately chemotherapy may lead pain , oral systemic infection , nutritional compromise . Late effect oral mucositis result cancer treatment include increase risk dental caries , xerostomia osteonecrosis . It recognise , regular assessment oral health , prevention early treatment oral mucositis decrease early late complication rate . Saliva play key role maintain oral health reduce salivary flow contributes acute disorder long-term sequelae oral health . Saliva complex fluid secrete salivary gland gingiva . In last decade numerous study investigate immunological biomarkers cytokine saliva sample . These study include individual various oral systemic disease include oral cancer , oral caries , autoimmune endocrine disease , metabolic syndrome , chronic kidney disease psychiatric illness . In child , study investigate salivary cytokine ( sCK ) suggest associate oral health ( sCK ) . For example , one study 114 healthy adolescent girl age 11-17 year show sCK concentration generally associate level serum . In addition study also suggest sCK concentration age dependent . However , number study suggest sCK may also reflect systemic disease show study include 20 child age 9-17 allergy ( include asthma , allergic rhinitis eosinophilic esophagitis ) show Th-2 cytokine detectable sCK . One study investigate sCK adult oncology patient show association IL-6 severity oral chronic GVHD survivor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Therefore determination sCK concentration may also helpful assessment GVHD activity inflammatory process cancer patient . In paediatric oncology patient , investigator ' knowledge , study far investigated sCK concentration marker oral systemic health .</detailed_description>
