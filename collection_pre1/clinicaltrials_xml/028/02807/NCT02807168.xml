	<brief_summary>Acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) health problem great magnitude , frequent cause hospitalization patient 65 year old . Of patient , 50 % readmitted within next six month consequent worsen prognosis , increase mortality high cost associate . In fact , two-third part cost condition due hospitalization . Hence increase importance ADHF associate hospitalization essential event natural history disease address therapeutic effort . However , present time change scenario make half patient show HF preserve ejection fraction ( PEF ) , acute heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( AHF-PEF ) fact high prevalence epidemiological relevance . To investigator must add , unlike patient depressed EF , HF-PEF therapeutic strategy may prove recovery affected patient . All make overall heart failure PEF AHF-PEF represent major health problem . However , despite lack effective treatment , also opportunities improvement term morbidity mortality evaluate . Rather look therapy new specific drug , opportunity may use management strategy among use biomarkers monitoring could key . In regard , NT-proBNP show correlate severity prognosis , include risk decompensation . Nevertheless , whilst late guideline heart failure management recommend use diagnosis HF , use biomarkers monitor guide treatment include yet . The assumption study use NT-proBNP may serve therapeutic management guideline in-patient HF-PEF discharged , allow reduction decompensations hospitalization well well functional situation 6 month . Several criterion propose define syndrome HFpEF accord 2013 ACCF/AHA Heart Failure Guideline include ( ) clinical sign symptom HF ; ( b ) evidence preserve normal LVEF ; ( c ) evidence abnormal LV diastolic dysfunction determine Doppler echocardiography cardiac catheterization The assay N‑terminal proB‑type natriuretic peptid indicate aid diagnosis individual suspect congestive heart failure detection mild form cardiac dysfunction . The test also aid assessment heart failure severity patient diagnose congestive heart failure . This assay indicate risk stratification patient acute coronary syndrome congestive heart failure , also use monitoring treatment patient leave ventricular dysfunction .</brief_summary>
