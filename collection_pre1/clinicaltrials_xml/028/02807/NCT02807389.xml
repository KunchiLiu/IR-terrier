	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study safety autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer use biomatrix ( The Gore Fistula Plug ) Phase I study use single dose 20 million cell . 15 adult patient ( age 18 great ) persistent symptomatic post-surgical gastrointestinal leak despite current standard radiologic endoscopic therapy enrol . The subject subsequently follow fistula response closure 18 month . This autologous product derive patient use patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visit 1 : Patients evaluate eligibility ( inclusion/exclusion checklist ) write , informed consent obtain . Patients undergo general exam vital sign . Patients schedule fat biopsy collect tissue need grow MSC . In event cell growth tissue obtain first biopsy , one attempt make second tissue sample patient . However , second attempt fail grow cell , attempt make , subject continue study . Visit 2 ( Week 0 ; Day 0 ) : Patients undergo interventional endoscopy , fistula tract assess stem cell coat place endoscopically . Study visit follow : Visit 3 ( Week 0 ; Day 1 ) Visit 4 ( Week 2 ; Month 1 ) Visit 5 ( Week 4 ; Month 1 ) Visit 6 ( Week 8 ; Month 2 ) Visit 7 ( Week 12 ; Month 3 ) Visit 8 ( Week 24 ; Month 6 ) Visit 9 ( week 52 ; Month 12 ) Visit 10 ( Week 78 ; Month 18 )</detailed_description>
