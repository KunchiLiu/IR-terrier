	<brief_summary>Pregnancy consider cardiovascular ( CV ) stress test , complicate pregnancy associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) later life . Moreover , know often pregnancy induce CV adaptation resolve completely short postpartum ( PP ) period clear whether induced change resolve long period time ( i.e . upcoming months/years delivery ) . Understanding cardiac adaptation pregnancy reversal process postpartum period , well factor influence process , may provide u insight mechanism , may help u identify factor may target point modification .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Women Specific Cardiac Recovery After Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal study explore pattern physiologic pathophysiologic cardiac recovery preeclamptic pregnancy compare normotensive pregnancy , till 18 month PP . This study longitudinal cohort study . The first measurement perform upon admittance induction labour caesarean section , correspond 48-24 hour delivery . Further measurement perform cluster PP interval : 24-48 hour , 3 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 18 month . Cases also receive additional baseline measurement upon PE diagnosis . Cases consist woman preeclampsia ( PE ) and/or HELLP syndrome current pregnancy ( early late PE , without intra uterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) ) , whereas control woman uncomplicated pregnancy . 290 woman total include . Inclusion case subject occur upon diagnosis , inclusion control occur delivery . The first visit study perform upon admittance PE diagnosis case , control participant administer induction labour caesarean section , thus extra visit necessary . This also true first postpartum ( PP ) measurement . The next 6 visit participant discharge hospital extra visit necessary , except 6 week PP visit , routine visit . The frequent visit may cause discomfort , especially since participant young mother still need take care child . During measurement , one co-worker assist take care newborn necessary , participant bring child . Each visit last approximately 2 hour MUMC+ . The invasive procedure venapunction 75 ml blood extract . The unfavourable side effect small hematoma ( rare ) . Clinically , participant advise base risk profile follow standard `` cardiovascular ( CV ) risk management '' . Transthoracic echocardiography , glycocalyx measurement FibroScan perform . Experience show investigation experience uncomfortable . Also , 3 liter exhale air collect VOCs analysis . All measurement perform supervise experienced researcher . These investigation already approve previously METC application ( CMO-nr : 2008/226 ; 2009/004 ; 10-2-066 ) . The measurement ( questionnaire , blood pressure ( BP ) , weight measurement , urine collection , glycocalyx measurement , FibroScan exhale air collection ) cause discomfort patient besides time take . On hand , potential health improvement early detection CV risk profile initiation already exist effective prevention strategy improve lifestyle important benefit .</detailed_description>
