	<detailed_description>Persons Hemophilia ( A B ) often experience recurrent joint bleeds , commonly affect ankle , knee elbow . These bleeds lead significant pain disability time . If recurrent joint bleeds manage prompt adequate infusion factor concentrate , damage cause presence blood joint space eventually result condition call debilitate chronic hemophilic arthropathy . The initiation adherence prophylactic infusion regimen , start first second joint bleed , essential prevention progression arthropathy . Studies demonstrate prophylaxis recombinant plasma-derived factor VIII IX concentrate effective prevent clinical joint bleeds progression debilitate joint disease patient severe hemophilia A B respectively . However , patient prophylaxis , absence symptomatic joint bleeds and/or structural functional abnormality joint physical examination plain radiographic image lead erroneous assumption prophylaxis completely effective . It establish patient severe hemophilia still risk subclinical bleeding ( `` microbleeds '' ) despite seemingly adequate prophylaxis . Young adult , despite lifetime prophylaxis apparently normal joint develop arthropathy 20 's 30 's . Prophylaxis currently practice may delay onset clinical joint disease . The recent advancement ultrasound imaging ( US ) proven effective confirm joint bleed , monitor evolution joint bleed assess resolution recurrence bleed . Previous study evaluate prevalence subclinical arthropathy young hemophilic adult use US MRI technique conclude US effective sensitive MRI identify subclinical joint abnormality . However , investigator ' knowledge , prior study use US technique extend period time monitor natural evolution joint arthropathy child hemophilia adherent establish prophylaxis regimen evidence clinical joint compromise . The seminal Joint Outcome Study , confirm role prophylaxis prevent overt clinical joint disease , mandate trough residual factor VIII level 1 % . While trough level significantly decrease overt hemarthroses joint damage , evidence suggestive microbleeds raise question protection afford low trough level . Intuitively would seem high trough level confer great protection microbleeds , result sustainable joint health . The `` ideal '' protective trough , establish . The investigator ' hypothesis US valuable imaging technique monitor natural evolution hemophilic arthropathy child severe hemophilia A B undergoing prophylaxis regimen manifest clinical evidence hemophilic arthropathy . Through observational study , investigator provide valuable information regard prevalence , progression severity joint abnormality . The use US detect microbleeds cumulative damaging effect demonstrable MRI , also allow tailor treatment implementation new prophylaxis strategy .</detailed_description>
