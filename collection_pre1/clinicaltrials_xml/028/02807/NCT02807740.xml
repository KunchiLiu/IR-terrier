	<brief_summary>Patients affect Parkinson disease ( PD ) benefit rehabilitation although evidence scatter . In last year increase evidence virtual reality improve functional outcome Parkinson 's disease . No evidence know concern cardiological safety effect balance Virtual Reality . The aim study compare virtual reality rehabilitation program versus conventional one sample patient affect mild moderate Parkinson collect data cardiological effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective , single-blinded , randomize controlled trial aim compare two different rehabilitation program PD disease evaluate effect Virtual Reality cardiocirculatory system . Patients undergo Conventional Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Program 6 consecutive week , 3-times week 40 minute session . Moreover , order acquire data cardiocirculatory system first last session Holter- electrocardiography use . Data compare healthy subject ( match age gender ) . The used protocol report . Conventional ( C ) Rehabilitation Program The Conventional rehabilitation program perform accord `` Royal Dutch Society Physical Therapy Guidelines physical therapy patient Parkinson 's disease '' . In C rehabilitation session , patient undergo 3 phase : 1 ) Warm-up phase : passive mobilization main joint muscular strengthen low limb ; 2 ) Active phase ( stand seat ) : exercise motor coordination upper low limb , balance training , start stop exercise , deambulation training ; 3 ) cool-down phase ( seated patient ) : manipulation exercise , mobilization exercise , respiratory exercise . Virtual Reality ( VR ) Rehabilitation Program Each session consist multiple exercise . These one describe , exercise perform patient 4 minute follow 1 minute rest . Exercise 1 ( name Trumpet H2D1 ) : patient place center room ask randomly touch move trumpet display wall screen . When trumpet reach patient 's arm , disappear give sound . Exercise 2 ( name Pink rise hemiarch leave right H1D2 ) : patient place center room ask touch rise project wall screen hemiarch , exercise sequence rise touch therefore distance target patient decide physical therapist . Exercise 3 ( name Doggy ) : patient place center room ask lead dog four corner wall screen . Patients free move room . Exercise 4 ( name Eggs ) : patient place center room ask touch fast possible egg project wall screen random order . When egg reach patient 's arm , disappear give sound . Exercise 5 ( name Mole ) : patient place center room ask reach mole go hole . The patient know mole move room . When mole reach patient 's arm , disappear give sound . Exercise 6 ( name Stay Or Move In Between ) : patient place center room wre ask perform motor task indicate physical therapist maintain balance two lateral bar order touch make sound . Exercise 7 ( name Leaves ) : patient place center room ask clean wall screen fast possible leaf project wall .</detailed_description>
