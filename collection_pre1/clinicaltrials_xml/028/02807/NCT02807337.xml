	<brief_summary>Prospective double-blinded randomize clinical study . Aim study compare effectiveness Caphosol mouth rinse prevention oral mucositis compare 0.9 % NaCl rinse . Patients randomize receive either Caphosol 0.9 % NaCl rinse four time day seven day begin chemotherapeutic regimen . The patient give opposite rinse next chemotherapeutic regimen , everyone get mouth rinse trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study double-blinded study researcher research nurse patients/parents unaware solution use ( Caphosol vs 0.9 % NaCl ) . They taste similar package ampule similar . Since Caphosol consist two solution ( A B ) mix immediately use , investigator apply procedure also case 0.9 % NaCl solution ( two vial 0.9 % NaCl mixed ) maintain blinding . Caphosol 0.9 % NaCl rinse relabeled maintain blinding . Every patient participate two time study . The treatment group allocation base randomization perform participation first time . During another chemotherapeutic regimen , patient automatically use another mouth rinse ( Group 1 = &gt; Group 2 Group 2 = &gt; Group 1 ) . This dependence-effect caused observation gather patient take account analyse data . Blinding maintain throughout study . The investigator estimate occurrence oral mucositis side effect chemotherapeutic treatment differs 3-fold different study arm ( 10 % Caphosol group , 30 % 0.9 % NaCl group ) . Power calculation use power 0.8 p-value 0.05 indicate 70 child need recruited arm , i.e . two repeat measurement 70 child need adequate statistical power . A drop-out approximately 3-5 % patient take account therefore investigator plan recruit 75 patient . Randomization perform use freely available web-based MINIM-randomization software . The data analysis perform intention-to-treat principle . Mixed-effect regression method use due repeat observation within study subject . Specific method use study : - Oral mucositis assess daily patient oncology ward home use Children International Mucositis Evaluation Scale World Health Organization oral mucositis scale . - In begin study , initial clinical evaluation perform pediatric dentist . During stay hospital , parents/patients ( nurse ) fill oral mucositis scale . At home , patients/parents fill scale . Scales fill day 14 consecutive day . Caphosol / 0.9 % NaCl rinse treatment last 7 consecutive day . - The available medical dental record audit frequency oral mucositis . - Oral sample collect pediatric dentist , bacterial analysis perform microbiologist University Tampere . - Laboratory value pain medication retrieve electronic patient file ( MIRANDA/Fimlab ) . - Blood test collect possible later use genetic study .</detailed_description>
