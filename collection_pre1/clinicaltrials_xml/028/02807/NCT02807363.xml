	<brief_summary>This Phase 2a , pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study determine safety provide evaluation PK/PD metric two different oral dos select upon result study LOPDT-PH1-01 - 4 mg oral tablet administer 28 day QD BID regimens . The PK/PD profile study drug compare leuprolide formulation approve treatment endometriosis ( monthly intramuscular injection , Lupron Depot 3.75 mg ) . Major PK ( e.g. , total exposure leuprolide ) PD parameter ( e.g. , rate estradiol suppression cessation menstrual period ) also evaluate Lupron Depot historical data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetic profile pharmacodynamic effect two Leuprolide Oral Tablet dose regimen : Leuprolide Oral Tablet , 4 mg , administer QD 28 consecutive day Leuprolide Oral Tablet , 4 mg , administer BID 28 consecutive day comparison leuprolide administer intramuscularly , Lupron Depot 3.75 mg . The study design randomize , open-label , parallel-group active-control trial . Up thirty-two ( 32 ) subject ( 12 subject Leuprolide Oral Tablet treatment group 8 subject Lupron Depot group ) randomly assign study drug ratio 3:3:2 . The randomization schedule balance use permuted block . The randomization schedule may stratify study site , necessary . The study consist two major period : approximately one month dosing ( either 28 consecutive day daily oral dosing , single intramuscular injection Treatment Day 1 ) approximately 1 month ( 28 day ) post-dosing PK/PD evaluation . The total study duration , screen final study visit approximately 3.5 month . After 28-day dosing period , four follow-up visit schedule 7 , 14 , 21 28 day last dose . During follow-up visit , serum sample draw assess leuprolide ( via single blood draw ) LH , FSH , E2 , progesterone concentration . During follow-up visit , subject ask onset ( absence ) menstrual period . The primary statistical analysis PK data conduct population subject complete 28 day dose . Supporting evaluation perform cohort subject receive least one dose study medication provide pharmacokinetic data . Similarly , primary statistical analysis PD data conduct population subject complete 28 day dose . Supporting evaluation perform cohort subject receive least one dose study medication provide pharmacodynamic data . The safety analysis perform subject receive least one dose study medication .</detailed_description>
