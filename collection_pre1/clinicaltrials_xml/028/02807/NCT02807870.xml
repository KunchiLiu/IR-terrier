	<brief_summary>Introduction : Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) one prevalent mental disorder child associate important negative functional outcome throughout development . The first sign symptom become apparent preschool age . Therefore , early intervention population potential limit disorder 's negative impact prevent future impairment affected individual . The first-choice medication treat ADHD methylphenidate , evidence efficacy safety preschool child . However , non-evidence base worry pressure medium place parent train first-line treatment ADHD clinical guideline . Parent train behavioral intervention implement parent , weekly session 8 12 week , adequate treating ADHD dysfunctional symptom behavior . However , level evidence intervention reduce . Furthermore , need trained therapist public health system , add difficulty adherence comprehension parent , limit generalization raise question regard indication . Until , study compare pharmacological treatment methylphenidate parent train preschool child ADHD regard clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness . Moreover , study evaluate impact pharmacological intervention psychotherapy neurobiological mechanism ADHD , crucial determine impact neurodevelopment . Objectives : This double-blind randomized clinical trial aim evaluate efficacy , tolerability acceptability treatment methylphenidate compare parental training placebo preschool child ADHD . Furthermore , investigator propose use advance neuroimaging technique assessment change brain connectivity institution treatment . Methods : This study randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , evaluate two active intervention placebo control group . One hundred fifty child age 3 year 11 month 5 year 11 month , diagnose ADHD , randomize receive treatment methylphenidate information ( 50 child ) , parental training treatment placebo medication ( 50 child ) belong active control group educational information parent placebo treatment treatment ( active control , 50 child ) . The treatment last eight week , neurobiological outcome assess treatment clinical outcome assess week 0 , 4 8 also evaluate 50 child typical development relation neurobiological measure . Implications : This study propose innovative relevant analysis , enable field advance knowledge biological mechanism related ADHD treatment response . Also , study expand evidence guide early prevention strategy early intervention .</brief_summary>
