	<brief_summary>You ask take part study either Ph positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) still small amount disease recently receive allogeneic stem cell transplant ( cell someone else ) . The goal clinical research study learn blinatumomab patient allogeneic stem cell transplant help control ALL prevent ALL come back patient either small amount ALL ALL past . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blinatumomab Maintenance Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Every study cycle 6 week . You may receive 4 cycle blinatumomab . Each cycle start around 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month stem cell transplant . In cycle , receive blinatumomab continuous infusion vein 4 week , follow 2 week `` rest period '' receive blinatumomab . You need remain hospital first 2 cycle check side effect . Length Study : You may receive blinatumomab 1 year . You longer able receive study drug disease come back ( ALL ) , disease get bad ( small amount ALL ) , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Study Visits : Before cycle : - You physical exam . As part physical exam , check graft versus host disease ( GVHD , transplant donor tissue attack tissue recipient 's body ) . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn effectiveness stem cell transplant . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing . Once week cycle , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . End Study Visit : About 2 week last dose blinatumomab : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn effectiveness stem cell transplant . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing . Other Information : During study , continue receive standard transplant drug prevent GVHD infection . Your study doctor explain drug give risk . Check doctor take drug may interfere blinatumomab cause side effect . This investigational study . Blinatumomab FDA approve commercially available treatment Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) negative B-ALL return treatment . Its use patient Ph positive B-lineage ALL investigational . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
