	<brief_summary>This study compare anesthetic efficacy Lignocaine articaine administer intraligamentarly use ligajet twenty five female patient irreversible pulpitis bilateral mandibular molar . At 5minutes post injection , teeth isolated rubber dam access perform . Patients instruct definitively rate pain felt endodontic procedure . If patient felt pain , treatment immediately stop patient rat discomfort use Heft Parker VAS . The extent access achieve patient felt pain record within dentin , enter pulp chamber initial file placement . The success define ability access instrument tooth without pain ( VAS score zero ) mild pain ( VAS rating &lt; 54mm ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present clinical study carry compare anaesthetic success 4 % articaine 2 % lidocaine intraligamentary anaesthesia patient irreversible pulpitis . Subjects randomly receive two intraligamentary injection use Ligaject two separate appointment spar one week apart cross design . Twenty patient receive intraligamentary injection 0.9 ml 4 % articaine 1:100,000 epinephrine ( Septodont INC ) first appointment 1.8 ml lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine . Each patient serve control . All injection give physician author . The injection perform insert needle gingival sulcus mesio-buccal line angle tooth needle direct approximately 30degrees angle long axis tooth buccolingual plane . Needle place sulcus bevel place away tooth towards alveolar bone . Needle advance firm pressure could advance . The operator wait 10 second slowly remove needle injection site . This step supposedly allow anaesthetic solution dissipate within tissue reduces amount anaesthetic solution dissipate within tissue reduces amount solution drip site needle withdrawal . However , almost case anaesthetic solution escape upon removal needle sulcus . Five minute post injection , teeth isolated rubber dam isolation investigator perform access cavity . Patients instruct definitely rate pain felt endodontic procedure . If patient felt pain , treatment immediately stop patient rat discomfort use Heft Parker VAS . The extent access achieve patient felt pain record within dentin , enter pulp chamber initial file placement . The success define ability access instrument tooth without pain ( VAS score zero ) mild pain ( VAS rating &lt; 54mm ) .</detailed_description>
