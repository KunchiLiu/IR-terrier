	<brief_title>Influence Dexmedetomidine Propofol ICU Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine potent selective α-2-adrenergic receptor agonist frequently use sedation ICU , also among critically ill patient . It promote sedation , anxiolysis , moderate analgesia minimal respiratory depression . Sedation ICU patient remain challenging doctor nurse evidence administration sedatives critically ill patient potentially harmful mainly relation delirium critical care consecutive clinical outcome . However , many case , sedation supportive patient ICU personnel allow controlled interaction patient establish comfort security , upholds patient 's autonomy herewith create less threatening environment . Delirium frequent acutely ill hospitalize patient , especially cardiac orthopaedic surgery , ICU , associate adverse outcome . It pathologic neurobehavioural syndrome cause transient alteration normal neuronal network activity secondary systemic disturbance . There much effort fight pain , agitation delirium ICU majority case deal . Many different sedative essential calm agitate aggressive patient , despite fact sedative bare inherent risk acute encephalopathy , especially post-sedation phase aggravate patient 's status thereby worsen outcome . However , prognosis patient untreated ICU delirium even bad . In surgical ICU University Hospital Basel , standard therapy delirium consist intravenous administration haloperidol either parenteral oral oral quetiapine . At present , despite recommendation use late American guideline sedation , analgesia delirium ( Reference : College Critical Care Medicine ( CCM ) Guidelines sedation , analgesia delirium ) ongoing concern safety efficacy , haloperidol first-line agent use worldwide treatment delirium general . However , seem evidence potential prevent delirium . Due disturbed circadian rhythm among delirious patient , exclusive sedation haloperidol quetiapine , especially night , insufficient frequently call additional sedative agent , propofol . There evidence beneficial effect circadian rhythm dexmedetomidine induces unique sleep-like sedation state highly select patient , dexmedetomidine infusion night induce light sedation could show increase sleep efficiency shift 24h sleep pattern mainly night . The mechanism action dexmedetomidine unique compare traditionally administer sedative agent due lack activity γ-aminobutyric acid receptor miss anticholinergic activity . Mentioned side-effects dexmedetomidine include bradycardia hypotension need vasoactive support case . The participant cohort always increase sympathetic tone , hypotension bradycardia expect case . Dexmedetomidine infusion therefore suggest treatment acute agitation bolus therapy advise . There seem negative effect mortality data suggest highly significant reduction incidence delirium , agitation confusion , low treatment cost , reduction ventilator day less critically ill patient , reduction ICU hospital stay dexmedetomidine use sedative agent . One study reveal dexmedetomidine reduce incidence duration delirium ; however , study restrict postcardiotomy delirium . Another study measure significant reduction incidence postcardiotomy delirium , one study non-postcardiotomy patient also doubt beneficial effect dexmedetomidine context . These conflict result call research field . Especially role dexmedetomidine unique patient population , neurosurgery , trauma obstetrics still evaluate focused investigation . In randomized study , investigator aim test hypothesis reinstitution normal circadian rhythm continuous infusion dexmedetomidine compare propofol 8pm 6am diagnosis hyperactive mixed delirium , decrease duration delirium . The infusion might repeat several time achieve resolution delirium . For delirium assessment investigator follow Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) , assessment sedation level investigator comply Sedation Agitation Scale ( SAS ) Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) , pain Critical care Pain Observational Tool ( C-POT ) and/or Visual Analogue Scale/Numeric Rating Scale ( VAS/NRS ) scale . To evaluate potential side effect ( see next section : study drug ) investigator record follow parameter : - Fluid balance - Blood count - Creatinine - Blood urea nitrogen - Triglycerides Creatine kinase , myoglobin lactate monitor evaluate propofol relate infusion Syndrome ( PRIS ) , threaten side effect long-term propofol infusion . If latter mention value elevate investigator would perform muscle biopsy , syndrome lead haemodynamic abnormality , lactic acidosis rhabdomyolysis . The evaluation electroencephalogram ( EEG ) enable investigator analyze different pattern sleep architecture influence dexmedetomidine propofol . Interneuronal communication base electrical impulse measure EEG time , even sleep .</detailed_description>
