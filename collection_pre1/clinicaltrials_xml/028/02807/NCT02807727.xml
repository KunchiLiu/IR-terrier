	<brief_title>Cardiac REperfusion With Intralipid® Reperfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center randomise control study cardiac protection INTRALIPD patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft cardiopulmonary bypass . Purpose objective : Reperfusion coronary artery bypass graft associate modifiable leak cardiac Troponin I ( cTnI ) secondary ischemia reperfusion injury . The purpose study test whether INTRALIPID administer reperfusion limit myocardial reperfusion injury measure cTnI release patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting . Trial design : This study prospective single centre double blind placebo control randomised trial . Sample size : 30 Adult Male Female Patients Investigational drug ( ) : INTRALIPID 20 % Fresenius Kabi ( SA ) Registration Number : K/25.2/316 Formulation : IV Solution Strength : 20 % ( 200mg/ml ) Modified Ringer 's Lactate Fresenius Kabi ( SA ) Registration Number : C/24/218 Formulation : IV Solution Dose drug : 1.5 ml/kg Administration : IV Bolus CVP Blood sample tissue biopsy : cTnI sample fixed time point , baseline 1 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour surgery . The first biopsy do prior cardioplegic arrest second biopsy do 5 minute reperfusion . Safety assessment : The safety intervention monitor routinely patient focus : 1 . Changes lipid profile Intralipid 2 . Coagulation measure ACT , TEG PFA 3 . Oxygenation Arterial Blood Gas monitoring 4 . Hemodynamic monitoring echocardiography 5 . Lipid interference laboratory measurement . The laboratory inform specimen preparation avoid interference instrument 6 . Post operative hemodynamic Intensive Care Unit Monitoring Measurement report safety monitoring consider adverse event measure parameter result range laboratory reference . Efficacy assessment . Primary endpoint : The efficacy drug determine geometric mean ( 95 % CI ) difference AUC cTnI concentration calculate accord trapezoid rule . Secondary End Point : Exploring molecular mechanism involve cardiac protection analyze tissue sample difference phosphorylation cytoplasmic protein kinase .</detailed_description>
