	<brief_summary>This project aim identify brain behavioral characteristic individual experience symptom generalize anxiety disorder predict effectiveness Exposure-based therapy versus Behavioral Activation Therapy . Brain imaging aspect study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Behavioral assessment include self-report questionnaire , computer-based observational task , interview . Assessments focus individual process positive information ( reward ) negative information ( distress image ) , well people make decision . These assessment conduct across 2-3 in-person session prior begin treatment , repeat across 2-3 in-person session complete treatment . A blood draw also conduct pre- post- treatment . Both Exposure-based Behavior Activation therapy consist 10 , 90-minute weekly therapy session conduct small group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) common anxiety disorder primary care , lifetime prevalence rate 6 % . GAD lead significant individual socioeconomic burden ( e.g. , due day lose work increase health care utilization ) . Although significant comorbidity major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , GAD diagnosis conveys much poor prognosis , 58 % GAD vs. 80 % MDD alone obtain remission two year . This highlight importance effectively treat GAD , improve mental physical health decrease socioeconomic burden . First-line treatment include medication ( e.g. , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ SSRIs ] ) psychotherapy ( e.g. , cognitive behavioral therapy [ CBT ] ) . While superior placebo , 40-60 % experience significant improvement , least 25 % relapsing within year . Thus , long-lasting improvement occur less 50 % patient . This ineffectiveness moderately associate symptom severity , illness duration , comorbidity , finding provide strategy improve treatment effectiveness . The current study seek identify behavioral cognitive-affective predictor indicate well patient respond treatment intervention individualize effectively treat refractory patient . The overall aim study identify whether neural , biological , behavioral response related arbitration conflict avoidance approach drive predict response Exposure-based versus Behavioral Activate therapy individual generalize anxiety disorder ( without co-morbid major depressive disorder ) . This accomplish use behavioral , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , genetic analysis pre post Behavioral Activation therapy . Research subject include treatment-seeking individual clinically significant symptom unipolar depression . Diagnosis assess use structured clinical interview . Anxious depressive symptom severity , personality characteristic , general functioning collect via self-report paper-and-pencil questionnaire . Objective measure approach , avoidance , conflict behavioral response collect use computer-administered testing related neural responsivity measure use fMRI . For exploratory aim , blood draw collect pre post-treatment examine genetic factor may predict response behavior therapy . This research potential identify neural behavioral approach-avoidance characteristic help predict patient likely respond Exposure-based versus Behavioral Activation therapy ( i.e. , predictor treatment effectiveness ) reveal target future treatment modification . Aim 1 : Examine relationship among approach-avoidance behavior neural response , baseline GAD symptom severity . Hypothesis 1.1 : Approach conflict arbitration behavior explain significant variance baseline symptom beyond avoidance-related behavior . Hypothesis 1.2 : Approach ( striatum ) conflict arbitration ( lateral PFC ) neural activity explain significant variance baseline symptom beyond avoidance-related ( amygdala ) neural activity . Aim 2 : Examine multi-level approach-avoidance behavior neural response predict individualize response Exposure-based therapy GAD ( compare Behavioral Activation ) . Hypothesis 2.1 : Approach-related conflict arbitration behavior help predict treatment response beyond avoidance-related behavior baseline symptom severity . Hypothesis 2.2 : Activity approach-related conflict arbitration neural circuitry predict treatment response beyond activity avoidance-related neural circuitry . Aim 3 : Identify change approach-avoidance process relate Exposure therapy elicit functional improvement ( compare Behavioral Activation ) . Hypothesis 3.1 : The degree conflict arbitration ability increase treatment positively relate functional improvement pre- post-treatment .</detailed_description>
