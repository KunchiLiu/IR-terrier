	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine activity SY-1425 patient relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , relapsed/refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , newly diagnose old AML patient unsuitable unable tolerate conventional therapy ( monotherapy combination azacitidine ) , lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) patient positive RARA biomarker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Biomarker-Directed Phase 2 Trial SY-1425 Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , multi-center , open-label study explore activity SY 1425 patient relapsed refractory non-APL AML , relapse refractory higher-risk MDS , newly diagnose treatment naïve AML , transfusion dependent , lower-risk MDS . All patient must positive RARA super-enhancer associate biomarker RARA pathway biomarker time study screen evaluation . Patients accrue four arm base diagnosis , prior treatment , risk group , choice treatment ( SY-1425 single agent combination azacitidine ) . SY-1425 administer 6 mg/m2/day orally divide two dos . SY-1425 give 28-day treatment cycle dose continuous . For newly diagnose treatment naïve AML patient receive combination SY-1425 azacitidine , azacitidine administer 75 mg/m2/day IV SC day 1-7 , SY-1425 administer 6 mg/m2/day orally divide two dos day 8-28 28-day treatment cycle . Dosing continue unless : patient experience unacceptable toxicity , disease progression/relapse , pursue post-remission therapy SY-1425 ( single agent combination azacytidine ) , Investigator determine best interest patient discontinue treatment . Newly diagnose AML patient achieve CR/CRi PR SY-1425 single agent treatment relapse , fail achieve CR/CRi PR complete least 4 cycle SY-1425 single agent treatment , eligible receive SY-1425 combination azacitidine . Lower risk MDS patient withdrawn study week 24 least minor erythroid response . Lower-risk MDS patient opinion investigator receive clinical benefit , meet minor erythroid response criterion remain study sponsor approval . Lower-risk MDS patient continue past week 24 continue receive treatment erythroid relapse , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity . An end treatment visit conduct AML higher-risk MDS patient within 30 day last dose study drug , prior start subsequent therapy monitor safety resolution adverse event . For lower-risk MDS patient , end treatment visit also end study visit conduct 30 day last dose study drug . All AML higher-risk MDS patient follow every three month survival 2 year patient withdraw prior relapse also follow-up event free survival .</detailed_description>
