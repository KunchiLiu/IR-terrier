	<brief_summary>This study multi-center , dual-arm randomize control study evaluate skeletally immature patient mild AIS curve . At six institution , patient randomize either scoliosis-specific exercise ( SSE ) treatment arm control group . The SSE group receive training SSE , posture , activity daily live physical therapist certify Schroth-based exercise method . The control group receive SSE instruction observe treat orthopaedic surgeon ( consider standard-of-care treatment method ) . Results compare one year treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scoliosis-Specific Exercises At-Risk AIS Curves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient AIS meeting follow inclusion criterion eligible participate trial : diagnosis AIS ; age 10 17 year ; major curve Cobb angle 15° 20° ; thoracolumbar , lumbar , primary thoracic curve pattern ; Risser grade 0 . Curves le 15° clinically meaningful progress 5° . Curves 15° also allow 5° measurement error . Curves 20° able progress least 5° bracing initiate accord SRS criterion ( 25° ) . Patients exclude accord follow exclusion criterion : scoliosis AIS , upper thoracic double curve pattern , developmental disorder prevent understand compliance exercise schedule , current previous brace wear , previous participation SSE program , previous spine surgery , inability commit perform home exercise program 15 minute day , 5 day week , inability commit attend least 8 hour PT within 6 month . Patient medical record review eligibility . If patient deem eligible inclusion study , member research team meet patient family review consent form private medical exam room . The family give ample time review consent form ask question . If participant chooses participate , consent form sign patient legal guardian prior investigational procedure occur . Once consent form sign , patient randomly assign TSRH site statistician one two follow group : 1 . Standardization Physical Therapy : Physical therapist Texas Scottish Rite Hospital , Boston Children 's Hospital , Columbia University Medical Center , Norton Leatherman Spine Center , Johns Hopkins University , Texas Children 's Hospital receive train certification Schroth-based ( BSPTS ) method recruit member study team . Physical therapist institution deliver standardize exercise intervention . 2 . Study Groups : A ) Scoliosis-Specific Exercise ( SSE ) Group Each patient assign SSE group attend least 8 hour supervise exercise training lead Schroth-based certified physical therapist course 6 month . Ideally , patient see 7 session : 1 . First session : 2 hour 2 . Session 2 : 1 hour ( 1 week later ) 3 . Session 3 : 1 hour ( 1-2 week later ) 4 . Session 4 : 1 hour ( 2-3 week Session 3 ) 5 . Session 5 : 1 hour ( 3-4 week Session 4 ) 6 . Session 6 : 1 hour ( 1-2 month Session 5 ) 7 . Session 7 : 1 hour ( 1-2 month Session 6 ) The exact number training session time frame determine patient 's ability perform exercise . All therapist use standardized exercise prescription algorithm performance checklist similar Dr. Parent 's Schroth scoliosis exercise study . Patients perform home exercise program 15 minute day , 5 day week , independently execute prescribed exercise accord follow criterion : 1 . Correctly move pelvis body weight base support neutral . 2 . Accurately set exercise per curve pattern different position . Exercises progress static dynamic passive active correction . 3 . Proficiently perform minimum 8 exercise integrate scoliosis-specific correction include auto-elongation increase space pelvis , vertebra , rib . Various kinesthetic , mental imagery proprioceptive strategy use open concavity depress convexity . 4 . Perform scoliosis-specific correction activity daily live . The overall goal patient maintain corrective posture throughout day . Patients ask use smartphone tablet application ( app ) perform home exercise program one method track exercise adherence . A paper version app available patient without access smartphone tablet . Patients also send electronically weekly survey regard home exercise adherence secure research database , Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) . An exercise log initial guardian help family keep track exercise adherence serve way monitor exercise adherence patient may smartphone , tablet , computer . Patients also able meet therapist return-to-clinic visit every 2-3 month thereafter 1 year follow-up ass performance quality , maintain motivation , progress intensity . Patients withdraw achieve 80 % exercise adherence within 6 month . B ) Control Group Patients randomize group continue receive standard-of-care treatment orthopaedic physician include regularly schedule clinic visit observation . Observation consist treatment scoliosis , routine clinical assessment orthopaedic surgeon detect curve progression every 3 6 month . Once measurement collect patient 's enrollment one year followup , patient group continue track observation skeletal maturity order record whether patient experience curve progression , prescribed brace , proceed surgical treatment .</detailed_description>
