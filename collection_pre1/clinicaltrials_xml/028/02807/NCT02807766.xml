	<detailed_description>Autism well-recognized neurodevelopmental disorder severely affect health child . While unclear neurobiological basis autism lack effective medication , commonly use approach treatment behavioral intervention . However , pathophysiological mechanism underlie intervention therapy remain incompletely understood . The current project aim explore impact different early behavioral intervention method brain plasticity autism use multimodal MRI technique provide guideline intervention treatment autism evaluate efficiency method . Investigators first investigate longitudinal effect behavioral intervention brain structure function child autism . In addition , investigator provide new biological index upon multimodal large-scale brain connectomes evaluate curative effect intervention . Finally , investigator propose prediction model intervention effect base multimodal multivariate pattern analysis method . Furthermore , investigator expect map state-of-the-art biomarkers multi-modal network provide new interpretation pathophysiological mechanism autism .</detailed_description>
