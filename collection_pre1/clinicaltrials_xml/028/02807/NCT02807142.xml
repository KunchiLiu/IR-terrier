	<brief_summary>The objective study determine cell therapy NC1 administer spinal cord effective treatment post-traumatic syringomyelia . The post-traumatic syringomyelia development progression cyst fill cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) within spinal cord . The cell therapy NC1 consist cell obtain bone marrow patient , culture vitro administer spinal cord patient .</brief_summary>
