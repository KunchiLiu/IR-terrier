	<brief_title>Relationship Between Apelin New-onset Atrial Fibrillation After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis systematic progressive pathological process , commonly occur intima large medium-sized artery . The disease lead degenerative , proliferative , non-inflammatory lesion ; thicken , harden , loss elasticity vascular wall , vascular stenosis ; reduce arterial blood flow . Eventually , organ damage occurs . Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease common chronic degenerative disease cause atherosclerosis . Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) effectively increase myocardial blood supply , prevent myocardial infarction , improve quality life , associate low rate surgical complication mortality . However , new-onset atrial fibrillation common complication coronary artery bypass grafting , incidence rate 30 % . It induce hemodynamic instability , often accompany left-ventricular systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure , increase risk stroke . Several study show initiation maintenance atrial fibrillation strongly associate inflammation , affect electrical structural remodel heart . The role C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , marker inflammation , widely investigate . C-reactive protein non-specific acute-phase protein , elevate many cardiovascular disease , include coronary atherosclerotic heart disease , heart failure hypertension . Elevated C-reactive protein level associate simple post-surgical atrial fibrillation , also cardioversion recurrence atrial fibrillation ablation . However , elevation C-reactive protein level lone atrial fibrillation , indicate inflammation associate cardiovascular disease , atrial fibrillation per se . One aim present study determine C-reactive protein level patient new-onset atrial fibrillation change coronary artery bypass grafting . Apelin anti-inflammatory effect different tissue . Ellinor et al . show level apelin-12 remarkably low patient atrial fibrillation . Recurrence atrial fibrillation high patient persistent atrial fibrillation low apelin-12 level electrical cardioversion . Apelin endogenous ligand G-protein couple receptor APJ , exhibit homology angiotensin II . The signal system stimulate apelin regulates many physiological function pathological process . The main target apelin cardiovascular system ; dilate blood vessel , antifibrotic positive inotropic effect . Falcone et al . show risk recurrence atrial fibrillation 3.1 time great patient low apelin level high apelin level . Furthermore , Yang et al . conclude apelin level low patient different type atrial fibrillation control , indicate apelin might contribute initiation maintenance atrial fibrillation . The investigator carry literature search Web Science ClinicalTrials.gov , use search term `` apelin '' , `` coronary artery bypass '' , `` atrial fibrillation '' . The investigator also search Wanfang Database China National Knowledge Infrastructure , use term `` apelin '' , `` coronary atherosclerotic heart disease '' , `` surgery '' , `` atrial fibrillation '' ; `` apelin '' , `` coronary atherosclerotic heart disease '' , `` coronary artery bypass grafting '' , `` atrial fibrillation '' . However , investigator find clinical study relationship apelin atrial fibrillation coronary artery bypass grafting . The investigator therefore design present study investigate relationship . In cohort study , patient coronary atherosclerotic heart disease schedule undergo coronary artery bypass grafting assign high low apelin group , accord preoperative apelin level . The incidence atrial fibrillation compare two group 7 day postoperatively . In addition , case-control trial patient compare plasma apelin level inflammatory response patient without atrial fibrillation 7 day postoperatively . Adverse event Adverse event coronary artery bypass grafting record . These might include myocardial infarction , myocardial ischemia , bradycardia , hypotension , stent thrombosis . The investigator provide detailed record date onset , treatment-related processing method , possible relationship treatment . All adverse reaction report researcher charge clinical Institutional Review Board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access Data collection : A table formulate data collection accord trial design . Data add electronic database use double data entry strategy . Data management : Accuracy information check recruited patient follow . The database lock researcher charge alter . All information relate trial preserve The General Hospital Shenyang Military Region , China . Data analysis : The electronic database fully disclose statistician statistical analysis . Open access : Published data available www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician blind group assignment , use SPSS 19.0 software . If measurement data normally distribute , data express mean Â± SD , count data express percentage . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . In cohort study , chi-square test use compare incidence rate new-onset atrial fibrillation coronary artery bypass graft patient high low apelin level . In case-control study , pair t-tests use compare plasma apelin , brain natriuretic peptide , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level patient without atrial fibrillation . Multivariate logistic regression analysis apply determine relationship plasma apelin level , cardiac fibrosis inflammatory response atrial fibrillation coronary artery bypass grafting . Frequency measure monitor trial implementation Trial progression report Ethics Committee General Hospital Shenyang Military Region every month trial 's status update registration database . Confidentiality Test data , include medical record , save electronically hard copy . The electronic data preserve dedicated password-protected computer manage data manager . The paper data preserve secure , locked place data manager researcher charge future viewing .</detailed_description>
