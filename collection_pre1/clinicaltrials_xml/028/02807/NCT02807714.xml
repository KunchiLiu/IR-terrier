	<brief_summary>The purpose study find association protein name Podocan WNT pathway regulatory molecule patient different form Coronary Artery Disease ( Acute Coronary syndrome , Stable Angina Coronary Artery Restenosis ) . It find experimental study protein regulate smooth muscle cell function hence may influence progression Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) . We test see regulatory function exist human subject . Studying patient 's blood possibly enable identify association Podocan CAD . This may help good prevent treat CAD improve understanding mechanism disease . No drug therapeutic intervention use purpose research study . Only blood sample collect cardiac catheterization lab . As part study participant follow repeat event repeat cardiac catheterization period 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Podocan Wnt Pathway Regulatory Molecules Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smooth muscle cell ( SMC 's ) critically influence clinical course vascular disease . The close regulation SMC migration proliferation within intimal space critical maintaining delicate balance insufficient excessive atherosclerotic plaque repair . When SMC proliferation suppress , ensue weaken fibrous cap result plaque vulnerability underlie Acute Coronary Syndrome SMC proliferation excessive , intimal hyperplasia hallmark accelerate Coronary Artery Disease follow Restenosis post PCI . While stent vastly improve upon recoil constrictive remodel component restenosis , problem accelerate intimal SMC growth remain . The current approach deliver stent release non-specific agent promote cell death and/or inhibition proliferation successful lower need recurrent vascular intervention . However , success come expense delay vascular healing , whose ultimate long-term clinical impact still evaluate . Short long-term negative effect heal arterial wall delay re-endothelialization , increase inflammation enhance thrombogenicity drug-eluting stent ( DES ) undisputed . These side effect DES mask prolonged aggressive dual anti-platelet therapy , expose patient - especially elderly - increase bleeding risk complicate clinical decision-making . This problem also cause fear early treatment cessation , demand rigorous patient compliance costly . These issue trivial daily clinical practice lack reliable clinical predictor restenosis precludes individualized patient tailor stent selection . Podocan protein within Single Leucine Rich ( SLR ) protein family previously unrecognized component sclerotic glomerular lesion develop course experimental HIV associate nephropathy . Its important role regulate smooth muscle cell function via Wnt-pathway recently describe investigator study . It show modulate experimental arterial repair significantly different expression pattern find coronary arterial lesion obtain directional coronary atherectomy ( DCA ) patient restenosis compare stable angina . These finding suggest possible clinical predictive role Podocan , Wnt-pathway effectory molecule incidence Instent Re-stenosis ( ISR ) need Repeat Target Vessel Revascularization . All patient present cardiac cath lab angiography evaluation know suspected CAD eligible enrollment . It expect , base angiographic result , participant fall one four category : 1 . No CAD 2 . Stable CAD , intervention require 3 . Obstructive CAD require intervention ( angioplasty , stenting , CABG ) ( Not associate acute event , MI ) 4 . Patients present Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) In elective/scheduled case , prior catheterization , peripheral blood sample obtain via IV access line previously place catheterization procedure . In emergent case ACS , blood sample obtain manner describe previously possible . It likely case , ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , possible base clinical care priority . In case blood sample obtain within 24 hour catheterization . These blood sample need obtain via venipuncture clearly labeled/recorded collect post-procedure . Blood sample frozen store -80Â°C freezer Research Institute . Samples batch send Baylor Medical Center test presence Wnt Podocan molecule ( Wnt-1 , Wnt-3 , Dkk-1 , Sclerostin , WIF-1 , sFRP-1 , sFRP-3 ) measure circulate level via ELISA Obstructive CAD ( non-ACS ) Group : It expect 900 stented patient enrol 18-20 month . Justification patient number derive specific aim attempt establish prospective component study , prediction restenosis . Given current average incidence restenosis 10 15 % ( DES around 7 % BMS around 20 % restenosis rate ) number guarantee around 100 restenosis event 900 patient . This give realistic statistical chance detect possible clinical predictive value variable . Participants consent sample found obstructive CAD require stenting maintain separately study database control group future analysis . The following information collect baseline angiogram : - syntax score order determine coronary atherosclerotic burden - PCI perform baseline angiogram ? If yes - type stent , location Participant chart review 24 month post catheterization collect covariates ( like age , sex , race/ethnicity , high blood pressure , obesity , smoke diabetes ) monitor follow event : - Repeat cardiac catheterization -- Re-stenosis stent place baseline angiogram -- Onset new lesion - Progression lesion treat baseline angiogram - New onset MI/ACS - Recurrent MI/ACS - Death due know cardiovascular causation CS Group : The follow information collect baseline angiogram : - syntax score order determine coronary atherosclerotic burden - PCI perform baseline angiogram ? If yes - type stent , location Participant chart review 24 month post catheterization monitor follow event : - Repeat cardiac catheterization -- Re-stenosis stent place baseline angiogram -- Onset new lesion -- Progression lesion treat baseline angiogram - Recurrent MI/ACS - Death due know cardiovascular causation Non- Obstructive/Stable CAD Group : The follow information collect baseline angiogram : -syntax score order determine coronary atherosclerotic burden Participant chart review 24 month post catheterization monitor follow event : - Repeat cardiac catheterization -- Onset new lesion -- Progression lesion treat baseline angiogram - New onset MI/ACS - Death due know cardiovascular causation Normal Angiography ( No CAD ) Group : Participant chart review 24 month post catheterization monitor follow event : - Repeat cardiac catheterization -- Onset new lesion - Progression lesion treat baseline angiogram - New onset MI/ACS - Death due know cardiovascular causation Comparison Historical Samples : The principal investigator own collection historical tissue sample angiographically define coronary target lesion biopsy clinical patient stable angina restenosis . The technique DCA ( Directional Coronary Artherectomy ) , sample collect , clinically do anymore , prevent investigator collect sample current study participant . The current study participant group accord exact clinical criterion historic patient hence represent comparable clinical cohort . The expression Podocan Wnt effectory molecule ( Wnt-1 , Wnt-3 , Dkk-1 , Sclerostin , WIF-1 , sFRP-1 , sFRP-3 ) coronary artery lesion obtain Directional Coronary Artherectomy analyze use immuno-histochemical stain quantitative histo-morphometric analysis compare restenosis Primary Stable Coronary Artery Disease publish investigator ( 5 ) . This comparison allow investigator examine relationship level Podocan Wnt effectory molecule , coronary plaque physiology , study endpoint disease progression evidence restenosis .</detailed_description>
