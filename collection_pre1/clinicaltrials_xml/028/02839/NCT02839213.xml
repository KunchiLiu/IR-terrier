	<brief_summary>The management normal labor art science . For decade , health provider work manage labor actively safely , goal shorten duration painful labor . Reduction Cesarean section fetal maternal complication also important aspect labor management . The safety active management labor demonstrate several prospective randomize clinical trial . A short duration labor admission delivery also consistently report numerous study woman treat active management protocol.Hyoscine butylbromide belongs parasympatholytic group drug semisynthetic derivative scopolamine . It effective antispasmodic drug without untoward side effect atropine . Hyoscine butylbromide quaternary ammonium compound peripheral anticholinergic action , central action cross blood-brain barrier . Hyoscine butylbromide act primarily block transmission neural impulse intraneural parasympathetic ganglion abdominal organ , apparently inhibit cholinergic transmission synapses abdominal pelvic parasympathetic ganglion , thus relieve spasm smooth muscle gastrointestinal , biliary , urinary tract , female genital organ , especially cervico-uterine plexus , thus aid cervical dilatation . Spasmolytic drug frequently employ delivery room overcome cervical spasm thus reduce duration labor . Hyoscine butyl bromide use shorten duration labor several hospital world . The mechanism act context labor yet elucidate , evidence efficacy largely anecdotal . Major study carry evaluate effect injectable suppository form Hyoscine butyl bromide cervical dilatation ; majority study demonstrate efficacy Hyoscine butyl bromide augment labor . However , study show effect Hyoscine Butyl bromide accelerate labor . In addition , study also use oxytocin active management labor , would certainly affect duration labor increase bias result . The specific objective study ass whether Hyoscine butyl bromide effective hasten cervical effacement dilatation , thus shorten duration first second stage labor without labor augmentation . We also intend determine whether use Hyoscine butyl bromide first second stage labor associate increase complication , increase blood loss rate cesarean delivery .</brief_summary>
