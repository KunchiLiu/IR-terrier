	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Dermal Neurofibroma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine selumetinib result shrinkage dermal neurofibroma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess effect selumetinib development new dermal neurofibroma treatment selumetinib . II . Assess effect selumetinib target inhibition dermal neurofibroma ( ) excise prior treatment treatment selumetinib analysis percent inhibition phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ) , change phosphorylated AKT ( pAKT ) tumor kinome . III . Assess effect selumetinib tumor microenvironment analyze peripheral blood bone marrow derive progenitor cell cytokine obtain pretreatment treatment selumetinib . IV . Assess effect selumetinib skin relate morbidity use Skindex patient report outcome measure . V. Quantify development new dermal neurofibroma treatment selumetinib . VI . Detailed pathologic analysis dermal neurofibromas pretreatment treatment selumetinib change cell composition ( include macrophage mast cell infiltration ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
