	<detailed_description>The investigator propose feasibility study intranasal ketamine provide analgesia anxiolysis minor procedure . This single-blinded randomized study inhale ketamine convenience sample child age 4-12 year age undergo minor procedure . For purpose study , investigator limit minor procedure venipuncture IV placement , limit patient population child deem investigator show resistance IV placement venipuncture without premedication . The investigator choose age 4-12 year child verbal able rate pain VAS scale , likely require restraint require staff member assist parent restraint , Green study find age range few adverse event ketamine . The investigator propose uniform dose 50 mg/ml intranasal ketamine 1 mg/kg . Ketamine dilute achieve volume 0.5-1 ml distribute naris . The plasma concentration intranasal ketamine fifth IV ketamine , peak serum concentration reach average fifteen minute later IV ketamine . Thus , intranasal administration find achieve mild sedation 1 mg/kg would expect achieve low level sedation 0.2 mg/kg slow IV administration , compatible subdissociative dosing use analgesia . A 1 mg/kg intranasal dose also consistent low end dose spectrum use anesthesia literature preoperative sedation . The investigator propose pilot study 20 child age 4-12 year undergoing venipuncture IV insertion . After obtain informed consent single parent ( investigator request exclusion require consent parent ) , child assign receive 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine via atomizer . Consent occur treat physician decide child require bloodwork IV placement , impact decision . All child receive EMLA . EMLA cream standard care area feel would ethical withhold EMLA purpose study . Ketamine add incomplete analgesia EMLA , may better option EMLA child know difficult venous access . EMLA universally effective -- find decrease VAS pain score 61 % -- cause vasoconstriction , increase procedural fail rate . Ketamine administer 30 minute EMLA apply . At 45 minute mark , procedure attempt . All child receive continuous monitoring pulse oximetry , blood pressure pulse rate time medication administer child discharge emergency department . All child direct continuous observation ED staff . The procedure complete within twenty minute completion nasal administration . After procedure complete , child ask rate level procedural pain Faces scale . A parent nurse procedure rate estimate procedural pain VAS scale . Child , parent nurse blind 's score . The investigator intend show nasal ketamine require minimal disruption ED resource treatment time , effectively treat pain increase child 's compliance venipuncture IV placement , increase parent satisfaction , without serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
