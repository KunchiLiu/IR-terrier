Healthy male AT randomly assign either 1 ) HVI steroid ( 50 ml ; 10 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride 20 mg Depomedrol follow 40 ml saline ) 2 ) HVI without steroid ( 50 ml ; 10 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride follow 40 ml saline ) . All subject perform 12-wk eccentric training program eccentric training 3 time per week week 12 week 24 . Clinical examination ultrasound perform baseline ( treatment ) follow-ups 6 week , 12 week 24 week prior baseline see possible change difference two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect High Volume Injection With Without Steroid Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Achilles tendinopathy ( AT ) common impair disorder . High Volume Injection therapy ( HVI ) seem show promising result Achilles tendinopathy ( AT ) . HVI consist large volume saline small amount steroid . Steroid injection widely use treat tendinopathy know literature steroid injection give fast short term pain reduction tendinopathy HVI seem show short term prolonged effect could contribute volume effect ( saline ) . Aim : The aim study determine effect steroid High Volume Injection ( HVI ) compare HVI without steroid ( volume effect ) functional outcome ultrasound tendon thickness Color Doppler activity chronic Achilles tendinopathy ( AT ) . Materials method : Healthy male ( 21-59 year ; n=60 ) AT randomly assign either 1 ) HVI steroid ( 50 ml ; 10 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride 20 mg Depomedrol follow 40 ml saline ) 2 ) HVI without steroid ( 50 ml ; 10 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride follow 40 ml saline ) The injection perform ultrasound guidance . All subject undergo 12 week eccentric training program subject continue eccentric training 3 time per week week 12 week 24 . Clinical effect assess change symptom pain ( VISA-A VAS score ) , tendon ultrasound thickness color Doppler . All outcome measure record baseline 6 week , 12 week 24 week follow-up . Statistics : All data analyze SigmaPlot v11 use two-way repeated measure ANOVA Student-Newman-Keuls Post-hoc test . This use see change time group ( time effect ) differences group within time-points ( group effect ) . All data present mean Â± SEM time .</detailed_description>
