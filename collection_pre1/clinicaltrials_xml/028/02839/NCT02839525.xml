	<brief_title>The Effect Nutritional Interventions Exercise-induced Muscle Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exercise-induced muscle damage associate eccentric activity affect muscle structural unit micro-injury promote local inflammatory response , muscle damage delay onset muscle soreness . These event cause impact athletic performance low adherence training program . To optimize muscle recovery damage cause exercise essential ensure adequate caloric intake , required amount macronutrients micronutrient . Recent study show protein intake sleep effective strategy inhibit muscle protein degradation , stimulate muscle protein synthesis facilitate adaptive response skeletal muscle physical exercise . Furthermore , evidence use anti-inflammatory nutrient suggest diet rich omega 3 reduce inflammation inhibition pro-inflammatory mediator . Therefore , intake nutrient combine protein meal sleep control food intake improve adherence sport training . The study consist three group everyone receive individualize diet . A randomization procedure determine type intervention . The distribution group follow : group 1 ( control ) - volunteer follow individualize diet olive oil capsule maltodextrin ; group 2 - intervention omega 3 individualized diet ; group 3 - omega 3 whey protein isolate intervention individualize diet . The order procedure perform : ( 1 ) Nutritional Anthropometric assessment ; ( 2 ) Individual orientation diet distribution supplement ; ( 3 ) Baseline assessment ( peak torque , muscle pain level vastus lateralis rectus femoris echo intensity ; ( 4 ) Muscle damage induction eccentric exercise protocol ; ( 5 ) Reviews 24h , 48h , 72h , follow routine method apply baseline .</detailed_description>
