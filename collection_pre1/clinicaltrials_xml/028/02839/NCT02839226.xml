	<brief_summary>This prospective , placebo-controlled , double blind , randomize study design ass heal effect AR/101 chronic Hard-to-Heal wound ( ) different etiology include arterial ulcer , diabetic ulcer venous ulcer , least 3 month duration . After collection comprehensive medical data confirm eligibility patient obtain informed consent , patient enter Screening run-in Period wound clean necessary surgical debridement irrigation ( isotonic solution ) prior initiation ( run-in phase ) study accord physician 's instruction . During 14 day screen period , subject receive standard care ( SoC ) daily basis , per indication patient status , accord physician instruction . Wounds morphologically assess treat physician photographic evaluation PI week - day 7 14 screen run-in phase . Following run-in period , Subjects wound ≥ 5cm2 ≤100 cm2 least 3 month duration fail respond treatment SoC screen run-in phase enrol study . Eligible subject wound randomized treat topically AR/101+ SoC placebo +SoC daily 14 day . During treatment phase I , depend wound size wound type , subject receive treatment dose apply topically daily wound dress accord physician 's instruction . Wounds photograph daily assess treat physician clinic week ( end weekly period ) . During treatment period , adverse event concomitant medication monitor ; wound morphologically assess photo documentation follow wound bed progression granulation tissue formation . At end Treatment period I , patient 's wound analyzed patient treatment arm wound score 0-2 assign receive study drug additional 14 day treatment phase II full accordance treatment regimen describe Treatment phase I . A termination visit perform day 14 Treatment phase I II earlier wind reach maximum score granulation scale wound ready skin grafting ; case early withdrawal due withdrawal consent .</brief_summary>
