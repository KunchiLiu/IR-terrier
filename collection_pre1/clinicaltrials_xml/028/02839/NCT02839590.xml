	<brief_summary>There currently many surgical option patient glaucoma ocular hypertension ( OHT ) , include Hydrus Microstent implant , HiFU ( High intensity Focused ultrasound ) , STAR flo , Kahook Dual Blade , Diode laser , trabeculectomy Baerveldt implant , little known different surgical technique use treat glaucoma affect flow fluid eye ( aqueous dynamic ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial objective Main outcome measure : The follow aqueous dynamic parameter measure : IOP , aqueous flow rate , trabecular outflow facility uveoscleral outflow . These parameter measure pre-treatment ( 2 month glaucoma surgery ) repeat 3 month 12 month post-surgery . Measures take operate eye contra lateral non-operated eye use control . Trial design This prospective observational study contra lateral untreated eye use control . Baseline measure conduct routine clinic visit 2 month glaucoma surgery 4 week treatment washout . Post-treatment follow-up measurement main outcomes conduct 3 month 12 month surgery , , 4 week wash . A number additional eye test also perform collect data study pre-operative appointment baseline measurement take post-operative follow-up appointment 3 month 12 month surgery . Other data collect eye test routinely perform pre-operatively post-operative follow-up appointment 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month surgery . Study participant recruit patient attend Ophthalmology Department Outpatients Clinic St Thomas ' Hospital , London , United Kingdom diagnosis glaucoma OHT ( ocular hypertension ) require glaucoma drainage surgery . One hundred patient glaucoma OHT clinical decision make need glaucoma surgery include study 100 eye undergoing surgery include together contra-lateral untreated eye use control comparison treat eye . Data collect study follow routine appointment patient undergo glaucoma surgery ask attend : pre-operative appointment , surgery , follow-up assessment 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month surgery . Baseline measurements take 2 month glaucoma surgery . At baseline assessment demographic information collect Details participant ' relevant past medical history collect baseline pre-operative assessment 12 month post-surgery . All test perform eyes contra-lateral non-operated eye use control . Aqueous parameter • Aqueous flow rate : Participants ask self-administer 3 6 drop ( depend age ) fluorescein sodium 2 % topically eye 5 minute interval night fluorophotometric scan . Fluorophotometry perform use scan ocular fluorophotometer 9:00 -12:00 midday . Four set triplicate scan collect 1 hour interval determine aqueous flow rate ( Ft ) . The 3 scan do quick succession , take approximately 2 second total complete set . Following set scan , IOP measure use pneumatonometry . rebound tonometry . IOP record mean total 12 measurement per eye : 3 measurement every hour alternate eye . Patients previous cataract surgery iridotomy/iridectomy excluded aspect measurement fluorophotometry inaccurate eye . - Outflow facility : Tonographic outflow facility ( C ) measurement perform use electronic Schiøtz tonographer ( Model 720 , Berkeley Bioengineering Inc , USA ) 9:00 -12:00 midday . The facility outflow measure rate decay IOP supine position application record Schiøtz tonometer period 4 minute standard 5.5 gram weight . The `` R '' value curve every 30-second time point manually enter McLaren tonography computer program . The program fit second-degree polynomial least square nine data point determines best-fit value time 0 time 4 minute extrapolation . - Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) : Pneumatonometry rebound tonometry use measure IOP patient undergo fluorophotometry . The IOP measurement record 1 hour interval hour 9:00 -12:00 midday follow set fluorophotometric scan . - Uveoscleral outflow : There currently reliable clinical method measure uveoscleral outflow ( Fu ) episcleral venous pressure ( Pv ) . Fu therefore calculate use Goldmann equation ( see ) assume episcleral venous pressure 8-11 mmHg : Ft = C ( IOP - Pv ) +Fu Where : Ft = Measured aqueous flow rate Fu = Ft - C ( IOP - Pv ) Fu = Calculated uveoscleral outflow C = Tonographic outflow facility ( value compute measurement device ) IOP = Mean morning intraocular pressure measure pneumatonometry Pv = Episcleral venous pressure ( 8-11 mmHg , exact value calculate base patient parameter ) Routine test At pre-operative visit baseline measurement take routine post-operative follow-up visit ( 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month surgery ) patient undergo clinical ophthalmological examination include follow test examination : - Visual acuity measurement ( Snellen ETDRS chart use . Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) Non Corrected Distance Visual Acuity ( NCVA ) measure use ETDRS ( early treatment diabetic retinopathy study ) chart . Best Corrected Near Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) measure use standard near vision chart ) . - Slit lamp examination - Visual field - IOP ( intraocular pressure ) measurement ( Goldmann applanation tonometry use measure IOP , except irregular corneal astigmatism corneal problem may preclude accurate reading . The IOP measurement do application topical anesthetic ( eye drop ) fluorescein ) - Gonioscopy - Dilated fundoscopy - Anterior chamber depth axial length - Central corneal thickness - Refraction ( routine baseline ) Description surgical intervention There potentially four type operation patient may part glaucoma care department : - Trans-trabecular meshwork implant ( Hydrus implant iStent implant ) - Ciliary Ablation Treatment ( Diode laser HiFu ultrasound treatment ) - External ( sub-conjunctival ) Drainage Surgery ( Trabeculectomy , Baerveldt implant Ahmed Implant ) - Suprachoroidal Shunt Surgery ( STARflo )</detailed_description>
