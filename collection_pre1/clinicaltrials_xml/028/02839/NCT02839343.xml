	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Before Surgery Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized phase II study evaluate 18-month overall survival rate patient borderline resectable cancer head pancreas use one treatment regimens . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 v 1 stratification factor . The primary secondary objective describe . Primary Objective : To evaluate estimate 18 month overall survival ( OS ) rate patient borderline resectable PDAC receive neoadjuvant therapy consist one follow regimen prior intend surgical resection adjuvant therapy 4 cycle FOLFOX : 1 . Arm 1 : 8 cycle systemic FOLFIRINOX , and/or 2 . Arm 2 : 7 cycle systemic FOLFIRINOX follow hypofractionated radiation therapy Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate estimate R0 resection rate patient receive two multimodality treatment regimen . 2 . To evaluate estimate event-free survival patient receive two multimodality treatment regimen . 3 . To evaluate estimate pathologic compete response ( pCR ) rate patient receive two multimodality treatment regimens 4 . To assess adverse event ( AE ) profile safety treatment arm . Patients follow 5 year post-registration .</detailed_description>
