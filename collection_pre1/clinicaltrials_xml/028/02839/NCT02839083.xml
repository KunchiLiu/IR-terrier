	<brief_summary>Breast surgery usually associate significant postoperative pain . Suitability analgesic technique breast surgery always questionable . The aim study compare US guide Pecs II block versus thoracic paravertebral block perform US guidance regard potential complication analgesic efficacy technique first 24 h modify radical mastectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pecs II Block Alternative Paravertebral Block Modified Radical Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various modality use perioperative pain management relevance breast surgery . Thoracic epidural paravertebral block ( PVB ) become gold standard technique achieve goal . However , technique may associate devastate complication spinal cord injury , total spinal anesthesia , inadvertent intravascular injection pneumothorax . On hand , advancement ultrasound ( US ) technology ability visualize pleura structure around paravertebral space increase interest performing thoracic paravertebral block guide US . `` Pecs '' block less invasive procedure involve US guide interfascial injection suggest potential alternative analgesic technique . The Pecs I block initially describe Blanco minor breast surgery . A year later , 2012 , describe Pecs II block `` modify Pecs block '' breast surgery involve axilla . The Pecs I block target medial pectoral nerve ( MPN ) C8 T1 lateral pectoral nerve ( LPN ) C5 , C6 , C7 . These nerve arise medial lateral cord brachial plexus , respectively , innervate pectoralis muscle . The Pecs II block target T2-6 intercostal nerve , long thoracic nerve supply serratus anterior , thoracodorsal nerve supply latissimus dorsi . Potential complication include accidental intravascular injection pneumothorax . The easily identifiable landmark allow block provide simple alternative paravertebral neuraxial block breast surgery . The block produce excellent analgesia use rescue block case patchy ineffective paravertebral epidural block .</detailed_description>
