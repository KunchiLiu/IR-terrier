	<brief_summary>Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis ( PEP ) well-recognized complication significant morbidity even mortality . A variety possible mechanism suggest occurrence pancreatitis , papillary edema cause manipulation cannulation endoscopic treatment receive attention . The papillary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction pancreatic juice , increase ductal pressure , result occurrence pancreatitis . Topical application epinephrine papilla may reduce papillary edema . Moreover , report epinephrine spray papilla may effective prevent PEP . However , still unclear epinephrine spray papilla prevent acute pancreatitis endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography . We therefore design prospective randomize trial determine whether epinephrine spray papilla prevent PEP ERCP .</brief_summary>
