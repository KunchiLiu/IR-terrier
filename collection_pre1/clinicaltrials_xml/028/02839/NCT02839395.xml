	<brief_summary>The human eye dual role , reflect various photo-receptors use vision image color , Image form photoreceptors ( IFP ) entrainment `` Biological clock '' locate hypothalamus retinal ganglion know non-image forming photoreceptors ( NIFP ) . The recently discover new photo-pigment melanopsin sensitive short wavelength ( SWL ) illumination exist the-NIFP . The axon NIFP form special nerve know Retino-hypothalamic-tract ( RHT ) transfer SWL signal biological clock result suppression pineal melatonin ( MLT ) production . This basic mechanism environmental light/dark cycle entrain biological clock transfer message organ , tissue cell . The American Medical Association ( AMA ) issue resolution 2012 state light night constitutes environmental pollution violate daily cycle , include wake sleeping cycle , suppress secretion melatonin pineal gland night . Results study show exposure artificial light night ( ALAN ) mainly emerge SWL source suppress MLT-produced pineal gland . Computers , tablet , TVs , smart-phones screen emit SWL illumination , day night hour , whether active passive user . The result previous study show , exposure SWL-ALAN illumination suppress MLT-secretion disrupts sleep pattern . In order understand well effect SWL-exposure emerge screen human behavior health , investigator study effect SWL-exposure structure quality sleep , cognitive function Continous Performance Test ( CPT III ) , emotional state , physiological , variable ( melatonin secretion level body temperature ) test previous study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator examine whether difference one-time multiple exposure computer screen light ( 350 lux ) . The investigator hypothesize multiple continuous exposure significant detrimental effect quality sleep consequently performance , emotional , physiological indicator , one-time exposure screen light . Procedure : On base-line , first fifth night study , end two hour exposure screen light , subject connect sleep test system skilled technician . On night ( night 2-4 ) , exposure computer light , conducted end exposure subject ask go sleep . During entire experimental period subject wear Actigraph watch ensure regular sleeping hour . In addition , subject ask expose computer/tablet/smartphone screen 20:00 h wake . An Actigraph monitor sleep week experiment . The subject invite attend Sleep Institute 21:00 h. The subject ask enter test room , dark , sit front computer screen two hour distance 60 cm screen perform on-screen task hour 21:00 23:00 h. The task include : reading write Microsoft Word document , , answer question deal document read , solve verbal arithmetic problem , attempt accomplish task correctly quick time possible . The subject tell purpose study examine effect content task quality sleep . During exposure , subject allow eat drink , go bathroom . At end two hour exposure screen light , subject connect sleep test system skilled technician . Body temperature 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate ( 6-SMT ) urine measure use on-set off-set method three time , 21:00 , 23:00 h , close fall asleep time . Three measurement take awaken . After sleep test system instal , subject ask go sleep morning woken his/her average waking time . After examinee woken provide urine sample body temperature measurement , sleep test system remove examinee give 30 minute organize him/herself , perform follow task ass his/her degree fatigue sleepiness : Continous Performance Test ( CPT-III ) , Brief Symptoms Inevntory ( BSI ) emotional questionnaire , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) Karolinska Sleepiness Scale ( KSS ) questionnaire .</detailed_description>
