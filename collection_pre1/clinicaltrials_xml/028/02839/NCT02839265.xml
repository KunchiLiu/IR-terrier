All patient receive daily subcutaneous injection CDX-301 ( 75 Âµg/kg ) 5 day , begin first day SBRT . SBRT deliver single pulmonary lesion . Depending size location target lesion , SBRT regimen 34 Gy x 1 ( peripheral tumor small 2 cm adjacent chest wall ) , 18 Gy x 3 ( peripheral tumor eligible 34 Gy x 1 ) , 10 Gy x 5 ( central tumor ) . The primary endpoint progression-free survival 4 month , define use immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) . A total 29 patient enrol .</brief_summary>
