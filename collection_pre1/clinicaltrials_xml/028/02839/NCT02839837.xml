	<brief_summary>Depression associate disruption mechanism regulate neuroplasticity . Effective treatment rehabilitation depression , neurological neuropsychiatric disorder , relies neuroplasticity . Thus , identify therapy enhance neuroplasticity ( neuroplastic adaptation ) vital comprehensive treatment depression . Aerobic exercise training demonstrate antidepressant property single bout aerobic exercise may provide short-term improvement affective state depression . Furthermore , acute aerobic exercise may enhance response know neuroplasticity-inducing paradigm . However , unclear aerobic exercise influence neuroplasticity depression neurobiological mechanism underlie acute neuroplastic change well understood depress healthy cohort . Thus , purpose project examine acute effect aerobic exercise neuroplastic , neurobiological , mood index depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator determine effect exercise two different intensity ( compare control non-exercise condition ) neuroplastic potential depress non-depressed subject . To accomplish aim , investigator subject ride cycle ergometer intensity set elicit 35 % ( low ) 70 % ( high ) heart rate reserve ( ( ( 220 - age ) - rest heart rate ) x 35 % 70 % ) + rest heart rate ) . Prior , immediately exercise participant neuroplastic potential test via transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , blood specimen sample , mood change assess ( method detail ) . These assessment occur time point every 15 minute 1 hour exercise . Neuroplastic potential assess use TMS . TMS-induced motor evoke potential ( MEP 's ) record abductor pollicis brevis way measure change excitability corticospinal tract response exercise pair associative stimulation . Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) cortisol level obtain blood specimen sample order examine potential exercise-induced change know stress- neuroplasticity-related biomarkers . Mood affect survey use Activation-Deactivation Checklist ( AD ACL ) , feel scale ( FS ) , felt arousal scale ( FAS ) . These measure permit assessment exercise-induced change mood affect .</detailed_description>
