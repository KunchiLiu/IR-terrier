	<brief_summary>In patient esophageal cancer ( EC ) neo-adjuvant chemoradiation ( nCRT ) follow surgery curative intent lead objective response 45 60 % , whereas 20-35 % patient residual tumor ( ypT0N0 ) pathologic examination . The absolute survival benefit response nCRT 15 % , still 14 % patient develop locoregional failure CROSS trial . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography compute tomography ( ( FDG-PET-CT ) able distinct responder non-responders , still miss significant clinical evidence . Whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) show potential benefit , might enhance combine method . PET/CT DWI-MRI precisely correlate anatomic metabolic FDG-avid lesion seem assess post-treatment change , especially regard nodal staging . Both technique claim important role selection patient clinical complete response ( cCR ) indirectly pathologic complete response ( pCR ) nCRT . However , exact role complementary effect technique still unknown . For appropriate judgment response , secure standard endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) / biopsy potential suspect lesion , nodal residual tumor , see PET/CT DWI/MRI EUS perform &lt; 2 week surgery , approximately 6-10 week nCRT compare situation primary stag . Patients clinical complete response ( cCR ) resemble pathologic response ( pCR= ypT0N0 ) nCRT may refrain surgical resection relate morbidity mortality . However , patient without early ( 2wk commencement ) response nCRT course may benefit nCRT . DWI-MRI seem effective pre-treatment prediction treatment outcome . Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) , indirectly measure tissue density , use determine likelihood tumor response treatment . High ADC treatment show predict unfavorable response . Tumors low ADC value presentation generally respond good treatment . An increased ADC patient nCRT could use predict early pathologic response i.e . discrimination `` responder non-responders '' nCRT .</brief_summary>
