	<brief_summary>Background : Most patient surgery cancer metastasize ( spread ) lungs later get metastasis treat surgery chemotherapy . The drug resistance may due DNA change cancer cell activate gene turn others . Researchers want test combination drug people metasteses . Decitabine ( DAC ) may reverse DNA change . Tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) make DAC last longer . Celecoxib may slow progression cancer . Objectives : To determine safe dose DAC THU mouth . To see DAC-THU without celecoxib reactivates gene lung metastasis . Eligibility : Adults 18 year old , cancer lung treat surgery . Design : Participants screen : Blood , lung , heart test Scans Tests virus Pregnancy test Participants blood stool test . They surgery remove metasteses 1 lung . About 3 week later , lung scan . If disease back , participant get DAC THU without celecoxib , mouth 6 week . Participants scan . If disease bad , continue study drug 4 week . Participants scan heart lung test . They surgery remove metasteses lung . Participants weekly blood urine test , plus several blood draw first 2 day take drug . Participants exams blood test surgery . Participants follow-up visit 1 3 month second surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Oral Decitabine Tetrahydrouridine With Without Celecoxib People Undergoing Pulmonary Metastasectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Whereas malignancy diverse histology express variety cancer testis antigen ( CTAs ) , immune response antigens appear uncommon cancer patient , possibly due low-level , heterogeneous antigen expression , well immunosuppressive regulatory T cell . - In publish study demonstrate induction NY-ESO-1 MAGE-A3 cancer cell various histology normal respiratory epithelial cell fibroblast follow exposure DNA demethylating agent , Decitabine ( DAC ) ; up-regulation CTAs facilitate CTL-mediated lysis tumor cell . We also demonstrate eradication pulmonary metastasis immunocompetent mouse follow systemic treatment DAC subsequent adoptive transfer CTL recognize murine CTA , P1A . In phase 1 trial , demonstrate up-regulation NY-ESO-1 MAGE-A3 well reactivation p16 thoracic malignancy follow intravenous 72hr DAC infusion . Chronic administration schedule necessary optimal gene induction solid cancer . - Additional study use murine tumor model suggest DNA demethylating agent may enhance activity immune checkpoint inhibitor upregulating antigen presentation , inhibit activity myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) . - Presently , information regard gene modulation antitumor activity oral epigenetic therapy patient solid tumor . - In study , optimal frequency/dose DAC-THU administration establish patient bilateral pulmonary metastasis , additional cohort patient receive DAC-THU together celecoxib inhibit activity immunosuppressive Treg myeloid derive suppressor cell . Correlative experiment perform ascertain oral epigenetic therapy modulates gene expression pulmonary metastasis enhances antitumor immunity neoplasm . - This trial intend establish rationale condition use oral DAC-THU +/- celecoxib combination immune checkpoint inhibitor adoptive immunotherapy regimen target CTAs patient thoracic malignancy . Objectives : -To determine pharmacokinetics , toxicity maximum tolerate dose oral DAC THU without celecoxib patient undergoing resection pulmonary metastasis Eligibility : - Patients histologically cytologically proven sarcoma , melanoma , germ cell tumor , epithelial malignancy bilateral pleuro-pulmonary metastasis render clinical evidence active disease ( NED ) minimal residual disease ( MRD ) metastasectomy . - Patients great equal 18 year ; ECOG performance status 0-2 , without evidence unstable decompensated myocardial disease ; must adequate pulmonary reserve evidence post-operative FEV1 DLCO ( Bullet ) 40 % predict ; pCO2 &lt; 50 mm Hg pO2 &gt; 60 mm Hg room air ABG ; immunosuppressive medication except non-systemic corticosteroid . - Patients must platelet count &gt; 100,000 , ANC great equal 1500 without transfusion cytokine support , normal PT , adequate hepatic function evidence total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/ml creatinine clearance &gt; 70 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) time DAC/THU +/- celecoxib treatment commences . Design : - Eligible subject bilateral pulmonary metastasis undergo disease resection one hemithorax - Following recovery initial hemithoracic metastasectomy ( approximately 2-3 week ) , patient begin oral DAC ( 0.2mg/kg ) -THU ( 10 mg/kg ) therapy 3-5 consecutive days/week depend dose level . THU administer 60 minute prior DAC . - If dose limit systemic toxicity ( primarily myelosuppression ) observe , frequency DAC- THU sequentially increase maximize intra-tumoral DNMT1 depletion avoid grade 3 great systemic toxicity . - Once frequency DAC-THU therapy optimize , additional patient also receive oral celecoxib ( 400mg PO BID ) . - Oral DAC-THU +/- celecoxib therapy continue 6 week . Patients repeat image study . Those patient exhibit evidence disease recurrence operate lung disease progression contralateral hemithorax undergo metastasectomy standard care contraindication progression disease extrathoracic site . Those patient exhibit response therapy evidence stable regressing nodule continue DAC-THU therapy 4 additional week , follow metastasectomy . - Systemic toxicity response therapy record . Gene expression DNA methylation profile pre- post-treatment metastasis compare determine DAC-THU therapy alter epigenome metastasis . Serologic responses upregulated CTAs well cell mediate responses epigenetically-modified autologous EBV-transformed B autologous tumor cell ( available ) assess treatment evidence CT gene activation follow DAC-THU +/- celecoxib treatment . - DNMT CTA expression level PBMC tumor tissue evaluate treatment ascertain DAC-THU deplete systemic DNMT level , determine alteration DNMT/CTA expression PBMC serve surrogate respective drug induce change tumor tissue . - Following complete metastasectomy , patient follow clinic routine staging scan per standard care guideline . - As exact set comparison analysis perform determine follow completion trial , base limited number patient , analysis consider exploratory hypothesis generate rather definitive . - Approximately 46 patient accrue trial .</detailed_description>
