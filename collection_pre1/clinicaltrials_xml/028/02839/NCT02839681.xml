	<brief_summary>Background : Anetumab ravtansine new drug . It kill cancer cell carry mesothelin . That protein surface tumor cell many type tumor , include lung cancer . Researchers want find safe dose study drug lung cancer . They want see shrink tumor mesothelin-positive lung cancer . Objectives : To test safety effectiveness anetumab ravtansine lung cancer . Eligibility : Adults 18 year old lung cancer gotten bad therapy Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Tumor tissue sample . This previous procedure . Blood urine test Heart test Scans . For one scan , small amount radioactive substance inject blood . Eye exam The study 21-day cycle . On day 1 cycle , participant get study drug tube insert vein . Participants repeat heart test cycle 1 2 . They blood test weekly cycle 1 , twice cycle . They scan every 6 week first 6 month , every 9 week end year 2 , every 12 week . Participants sample tumor tissue take twice . About 30 day stop study drug , participant follow-up visit . This include medical history , physical exam , blood pregnancy test , heart eye test .

	<brief_title>Anti-Mesothelin Antibody Drug Conjugate Anetumab Ravtansine Mesothelin Expressing Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related death worldwide , account one million death every year . - Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) constitute approximately 85 % lung cancer 40 % patient newly diagnose NSCLC advanced disease . The median year overall survival advance NSCLC least 1 year . - In recent year , identification oncogenic alteration mutation EGFR ALK translocation therapy target tumor immune escape mechanism lead substantial improvement prognosis patient advance lung cancer ; however , alteration detect less half advance NSCLC patient small subset patient respond immunotherapeutic intervention available today . - Anetumab ravtansine ( BAY 94-9343 ) antibody-drug conjugate target mesothelin , protein normally present mesothelial cell . A Phase I trial show overall acceptable manageable safety profile . It develop patient mesothelin express cancer ; clinical development furthest along mesothelioma registration phase II clinical trial . - NCI researcher demonstrate mesothelin mRNA protein present substantial number lung adenocarcinoma cell line ; mesothelin expression observe 50 % advanced lung adenocarcinomas immunohistochemical assessment Objectives : Safety Run-in -To evaluate safety tolerability anetumab ravtansine patient previously treat unresectable mesothelin express advanced lung adenocarcinoma ( stage IIIB IV ) . Phase 2 -To determine efficacy ( objective response rate ) anetumab ravtansine patient advance ( Stage IIIb ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) mesothelin express lung adenocarcinoma . Eligibility : - Age &gt; 18 year . - Histologically cytologically confirm previously treat unresectable mesothelin express advanced lung adenocarcinoma ( stage IIIB IV ) - Positive mesothelin expression archival tumor tissue , define mesothelin membrane intensity score 2+ 3+ ( 0-3 scale ) express membrane great equal 10 % tumor cell . - Should receive least one prior platinum base chemotherapy immune checkpoint target agent . In addition , subject epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] -mutated anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ ALK ] -translocated NSCLC receive FDA-approved targeted therapy appropriate . - Normal organ function Design : - This open label , single center , phase I/II study anetumab ravtansine subject mesothelin positive lung adenocarcinoma . - During safety run-in portion study , de-escalating dos assess determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . - During phase 2 portion study , ( RP2D ) assess objective response rate . - During portion study , anetumab ravtansine administer intravenously every 3 week disease progression absence clinical benefit , patient withdrawal occurrence intolerable toxicity . - Response assessment ( image ) occur every 6 week first 6 month , every 9 week end year 2 , every 12 week thereafter . - Up 12 evaluable patient enrol safety run-in portion study . Approximately twenty patient , include 6 safety run-in portion study , evaluate phase 2 portion study . The accrual ceiling set 55 accommodate screen failure ( 50 % failure rate regard mesothelin expression ) inevaluable subject .</detailed_description>
