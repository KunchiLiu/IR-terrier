	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder often life-long consequence affect young child critical developmental period . The Centers Disease Control estimate ASD affect many 14.7 per 1000 child ( 1 68 ) .

Folinic acid , also know leucovorin , approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) decrease side effect cancer chemotherapy . Folinic acid may helpful treat language problem child autism spectrum disorder , know . Therefore , folinic acid investigational new drug study . The primary aim study evaluate efficacy tolerability high-dose folinic acid improve closely associate symptom language impairment child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Improvement delay language may also benefit core ASD problem social communication . The study also focus identification biomarkers pre-specified subgroup child ASD may moderate positive response folinic acid . The study model high-dose folinic acid improve language set stage improve social communication child ASD moderate language impairment . To test whether folinic acid superior placebo , 160 child ( age 5 12 yrs 6 month , inclusive ) ASD moderate language randomly assign folinic acid placebo 12 week double-blind condition .
