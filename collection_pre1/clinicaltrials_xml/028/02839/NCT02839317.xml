	<brief_summary>The cause CD could different accord age onset CD symptom . Indeed know young patient CD diagnosis particular genetic variant abnormality IL10R regard quite monogenic disease . In way , microbiota also undergo substantial change extremes life , infant older people ramification explore . The comparison microbiota principal component analysis genetic profile patient CD begin extreme life could help u good know physiopathology CD accord age provide argument CD begin extreme life could different disease . The aim study ascertain population-based study hypothesis gut microbiota different paediatric-onset elderly-onset CD patient relation genetic environmental mechanism . The result provide good knowledge etiopathogenic way CD propose personalize therapeutic care base age CD onset ( i.e . accord gut bacteria involve ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim describe principal component analysis compare gut microbiota subgroup paediatric-onset ( n=75 ) , elderly-onset CD patient ( n=75 ) control subject ( 75 paediatric control 75 elderly control subject match age ) without priori approach high throughput sequence bacterial DNA . As show type IBD-associated dysbiosis depend ileal involvement , Paediatric-onset elderly-onset CD patient stratify accord parameter . The secondary aim : - ( I ) Find specific bacteria involve paediatric- elderly-onset patient use PLS Discriminant Analysis ( PLS-DA ) classical PLS regression ( regression mode ) response variable categorical . - ( II ) Search association bacterial dysbiosis different genetic background patient accord age CD onset ( paediatric-onset v elderly-onset ) control subject ; - ( III ) Quantify bacteria invasive property ( E. coli , include adherent-invasive E.coli , Shigella , Salmonella , Yersinia , Campylobacter ) , fecal fungal flora ( Candida albicans , particular ) association genetic serological profile accord age CD onset control subject ; study include comparison gut microbiome subgroup paediatric-onset , elderly-onset CD patient control subject . - ( IV ) Study environmental risk factor use questionnaire submit CD patient control subject . The result would provide good knowledge etiopathogenic way CD would downstream open way towards clinical trial focus specific microbiota disorder accord age CD onset . This project help decipher potential involvement specific bacteria physiopathology CD . This could lead development new therapeutic strategy either use optimized current treatment target bacteria . Data clinical trial great majority rarely include paediatric patient set upper limit study eligibility 65 year age thus focus adult-onset disease . Thus potential specificity paediatric- elderly-onset disease take account . A good knowledge characteristic CD extreme life important set innovative clinical trial include specific therapeutic adapt patient disease occur extreme age life , especially patient benefit specific trial . The ultimate goal well quality care deliver paediatric- elderly-onset CD patient .</detailed_description>
