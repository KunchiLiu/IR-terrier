	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) follow cycle 1 experimental regimen 1 2 ( pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride [ pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ] [ PLD ] atezolizumab PLD/bevacizumab atezolizumab ) . ( Safety lead-in ) II . Progression-Free survival ( PFS ) . ( Phase II study ) III . Overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective response rate ( ORR , either partial complete response ) . ( Phase II study ) II . Safety measure frequency severity adverse event Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v. ) 4.0 . ( Phase II study ) III . ORR PFS . ( Phase III study ) IV . Safety measure frequency severity adverse event Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v.4.0 . ( Phase III study ) V. Patient Reported outcome ( PRO ) measure National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) - Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) ovarian symptom index ( NFOSI ) -18 , disease-related symptom ( DRS ) , treatment side effect ( TSE ) , function/well-being ( FWB ) , Neurotoxicity ( FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group [ GOG ] -neurotoxicity [ NTX ] -4 ) , Fatigue ( Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [ FACIT-F ] -9 ) Abdominal Discomfort ( FACT/GOG-abdominal discomfort [ AD ] ) . ( Phase III study ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether biomarkers pre-treatment tissue , peripheral blood , stool specimen predict ORR , PFS and/or OS . II . To determine whether change quantitative biomarker parameter first 6 12 week therapy predict ORR , PFS and/or OS . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 8 . ARM II : Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 8 , atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 8 . ARM III : Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 8 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
