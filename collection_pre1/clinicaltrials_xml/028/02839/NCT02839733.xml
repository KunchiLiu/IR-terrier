	<brief_summary>Background : Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common childhood motor disability . The neurotransmitter dopamine ( DA ) important cognition emotions/behavior . DA may also important motor skill learn . Genes relate DA function may affect person ability learn new cognitive motor skill . Some child CP learn motor skill easily others trouble . Researchers want find DA gene variation cause variability . Objectives : To learn DA related gene affect motor cognitive learning people without CP . Eligibility : People age 5 25 without CP : Follow protocol Attend perform training session Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood draw genetic test The study 2 part . Participants CP join . Those without join Part 1 . All participant baseline assessment : short motor skill test blood draw . Part 1 : Two 10-session training program 2 week . Cognitive training 2 session clinic , 8 home . Participants perform memory task computer . All 10 motor training session clinic . Participants step line virtual reality environment . Part 2 : Two lab training session least 1 week apart . Participants perform task computer . Participants CP may brain MRI 1 visit . They lie table slide machine take picture . They scanner 45 minute . They may</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The broad objective study determine relationship variation gene relate dopamine ( DA ) neurotransmission area brain associate motor lean ( e.g . DRD1 , DRD2 , DRD3 , COMT , DAT ) and/or activity-dependent brain plasticity ( e.g . BDNF ) difference motor learn rate cognitive processing ability person without cerebral palsy ( CP ) . We hypothesize individual genetic difference relate ability learn new motor cognitive skill may thus provide potential explanation often report response variability rehabilitative therapy see CP . We also explore whether motor cognitive learning ability correlate within individual could suggest similar underlying neural mechanism . Finally would like evaluate effect reward procedural learn CP , preliminarily assess behavioral manipulation DA system may affect learn across individual . Study Population : A maximum 100 ambulatory child young adult without CP ( age 5-25 inclusive ) enrol protocol . Design : This protocol consist two separate relate study : Study # 1 observational trial whereby subject without CP participate two different train paradigm , 10 session , one involve learn novel work memory task one involve motor skill learn low extremity , adapt horizontal ladder task utilized rodent study . All blood draw genetic analysis baseline , result related change performance ( learn ) per task training . Study # 2 within-subjects evaluation CP effect reward ( versus no-reward ) learning , presumed increase dopamine transmission . Mean individual response reward-based learn assess related genetic variation dopamine transmission . For subject CP , would like obtain brain MRI optional unable unwilling portion , still participate protocol . Outcome Measures : Primary outcome change performance ( learn ) task training relate presence absence polymorphism associate brain plasticity deficit work memory and/or motor learning . Individual response reward also related variation relate high versus low dopamine transmission brain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For subject : 1 . Ages 525 inclusive 2 . Able follow study protocol 3 . Able attend perform training session schedule Additional criterion subject CP : 1 . Diagnosis cerebral palsy 2 . Gross Motor Functional Classification Scale Level III ( able walk least 10 meter without assistive device ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For subject : 1 . Presence injury medical condition ( besides CP ) would affect motor function ability perform motor train program . Additional criterion subject CP : 1 . Less 6 month major surgery legs 2 . Currently take levodopa , trihexyphenidyl , methylphenidate baclofen since may affect dopamine transmission neuroplasticity . Additional criterion CP choose MRI : 1 . Have follow contraindication MRI scan : 1 . Pregnancy 2 . A ventriculoperitoneal shunt 3 . Have claustrophobia comfortable small enclose space 4 . Have metal would make MRI scan unsafe : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion devise , cochlear ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( nitroglycerine ) , metallic implant object , body pierce remove , bone joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel metal embed ( war wound accident previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near eye ) . 5 . Excessive startle reaction fear loud noise</criteria>
