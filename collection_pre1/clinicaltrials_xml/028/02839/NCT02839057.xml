	<brief_summary>Fractures second cervical vertebra ( C2 ) common spinal fracture among elderly . Non-surgical treatment comprise cervical collar treatment 12 week , surgical treatment elderly could mean posterior fixation C1-C2 without collar treatment anterior screw osteosynthesis C2 6 week collar treatment . A meta-analysis retrospective study recently find improved survival surgical treatment . This national registry study design estimate survival non-surgical surgical treatment population-based cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Swedish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) host Swedish Agency Health Welfare contain patient contact within Sweden coverage &gt; 90 % orthopaedic diagnosis . Registered main diagnosis co-morbidity use ICD-9 code 1996 1997 onward ICD-10 code . Treatment cod since 1996 use Swedish classification surgical procedure . Furthermore , information hospitalisation time available registry . In Swedish Cause Death Registry ( CDR ) death Sweden register date death cause death . While date death coverage complete , cause death 46 % agreement final hospital diagnosis . All patient main diagnosis C2 fracture ( ICD-10 : S12.1 ) treat January 1st 1996 December 31st 2014 extract NPR merge CDR incident death . Prior data transmission , Swedish Agency Health Welfare anonymised individual personal identification number use key remained Agency . Invalid age data exclude either due miss entry mismatch date death . Multiple admission ( case identification number 12 month admission ) duplicate entry ( case identification number ) remove dataset , valuable co-morbidity data duplicate entry store original record . Duplicate entry originate separate recording hospital patient refer specialised hospital . Furthermore , primarily non-surgically treated case change treatment modality register surgical patient . The registered hospitalisation time patient combine non-surgical surgical in-hospital treatment period . From record Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI ) calculate . Using Swedish surgical procedure cod spinal fusion ( `` NAG '' ) spinal osteosynthesis ( `` NAJ '' ) patient receive surgical treatment mark , cohort divide two group receive non-surgical surgical treatment . The age distribution difference patient C2-fractures treat surgically non-surgically visualised density distribution plot . A logit logistic regression analysis identify covariates surgical treatment assignment present 95 % confidence interval ( C.I . ) statistical probability p. Goodness-of-fit model present pseudo-r2 accord McFadden . Using Kaplan-Meier method non-surgical surgical treatment mean survival , well survival rate 3 month , 1 year , 2 year determine , visualise use Kaplan-Meier plot 99 % C.I . With Cox proportional hazard regression method multiple covariates contribute survival enter hazard ratio ( HR ) present 95 % C.I . probability p. As relevant covariates survival besides surgical treatment age , gender , spinal cord injury , CCI identify . Since assumption medical advancement improve patient survival general last decade , even year admission include covariate model . In order identify cut-off age treatment modality associate anymore great survival adjust HR certain age plot age 95 % C.I .</detailed_description>
