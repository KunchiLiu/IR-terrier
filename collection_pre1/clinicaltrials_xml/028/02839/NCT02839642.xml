	<brief_summary>Progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) rare neurodegenerative disease parkinsonian syndrome group . It represent 5 10 % parkinsonian syndromes affect 3,000 10,000 person France . PSP characterise doparesistant parkinsonism axial sign early gait instability fall , oculomotor sign vertical gaze palsy , dysphagia dysarthria , cognitive behavioural disturbance . The latter predominantly manifest psycho-motor slowness , apathy frontal executive deficit . Swallowing impairment fall may lead life-threatening situation death occur 6-9 year disease onset . Apart L-dopa may transiently inconsistently improve motor symptom effective symptomatic , disease-modifying neuroprotective therapy presently available reduce disability way . Therefore patient often receive mostly non-medical care physiotherapy speech therapy . In addition dopaminergic degeneration evidence cholinergic deficit PSP correlate gait balance impairment . This stand contrast limited number study cholinergic augmentation strategy PSP . Trials cholinesterase inhibitor PSP produce rather conflict result : donepezil improves cognition deteriorate motor function whereas case series 5 PSP patient treat rivastigmine find improvement several cognitive aspect deterioration motor function .On hand Parkinson 's disease convincing evidence positive effect rivastigmine cognition , apathy fall Investigators ' hypothesis rivastigmine ( acetyl- butyryl-cholinesterase inhibitor ) may reduce gait postural impairment PSP may therefore limit number fall consequence term injury sustain ( fracture etc ... ) patient ' autonomy . In addition investigator hypothesise rivastigmine may also reduce cognitive behavioural impairment associate PSP . Taken together improvements likely produce significant effect patient ' quality life caregiver burden .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Probable PSP Richardson subtype define NINDSSPSP criterion modify allow inclusion patient first fall within 3 year disease onset . Aged 41 80 year time screen Judged site investigator able comply gait/balance neuropsychological evaluation baseline throughout study Able ambulate independently assistance ( cane ) Score ≥ 20 minimental state examination ( MMSE ) screen A reliable caregiver define person frequent contact subject ( ≥ 3 hour per day ) willing fill fall diary monitor study medication compliance subject 's health concomitant medication throughout study must accompany subject visit . A fall near fall rate ≥ 2/week average ( estimate interview screen confirm 2week period screen baseline use fall postcard ) . Any parkinsonian medication take subject must stable dose 4 week prior screen must remain stable duration study Stable chronic medication 4 week prior screen Written inform consent provide subject caregiver . Non ambulatory patient . History clinical examination suggest another parkinsonian syndrome ( Parkinson 's disease , Dementia Lewy Bodies , Corticobasal Degeneration , Multisystem Atrophy , Vascular Parkinsonism , tumoral parkinsonism , antipsychotic druginduced parkinsonism ) Presence significant neurological psychiatric disorder : Alzheimer 's disease , epilepsy , history stroke , psychotic disorder , severe bipolar unipolar disorder A fall near fall rate &lt; 2/week average ( 2week period screen baseline use fall postcard ) . Insufficient fluency local language complete neuropsychological , global gait/balance assessment Score &lt; 20 minimental state examination screen Within 4 week screen course study concurrent treatment cholinesterase inhibitor medication ( donepezil , galantamine , rivastigmine ) cholinergic agent ( agonist antagonist ) include memantine . History deep brain stimulation surgery . Within 4 week screen course study concurrent treatment beta blocker , antipsychotic drug mood stabiliser . Any malignancy within 5 year screen current significant judge site investigator hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , neurological disease . Presence active gastroduodenal ulcer , unstable asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . History current urinary retention require either anticholinergic medication urethral catheterisation . The systolic blood pressure measurement &gt; 190 &lt; 85 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure measurement &gt; 105 &lt; 50 mm Hg screening . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality screen , include creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 3 time upper limit normal reference range . The ECG abnormal screen judge clinically significant site investigator . Particular attention give sign suggest conduction disorder . Treatment investigational drug device within 60 day screen . Ongoing pregnancy lactation . Women childbearing potential use form efficacious contraception . Any contraindication rivastigmine define ANSM Known hypersensitivity rivastigmine cholinesterase inhibitor medication .</criteria>
