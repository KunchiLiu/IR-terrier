Patients positive result indicate true active chronic infection may enroll discussion consensus agreement treat physician principal investigator . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use acceptable method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study least 3 month last dose ipilimumab manner risk pregnancy minimize . See definition WOCBP . WOCBP must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior first dose ipilimumab/nivolumab Women must breastfeed Willing adhere study visit schedule prohibition restriction specify protocol . Inflammatory breast cancer Medical history concurrent diseases Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy , interfere interpretation study result . Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies Chronic use immunosuppressant and/or systemic corticosteroid ( used management cancer noncancerrelated illness ) . However , use corticosteroid allow treatment immune related Adverse Events ( irAEs ) , adrenal insufficiency . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab . Prior treatment CD137 agonist , ipilimumab CTLA4 inhibitor ; Prior investigational agent within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab ; Prior therapy anticancer agent include chemotherapy , adjuvant chemotherapy , immunosuppressive agent , surgery radiotherapy within 4 week prior first dose ipilimumab .</criteria>
