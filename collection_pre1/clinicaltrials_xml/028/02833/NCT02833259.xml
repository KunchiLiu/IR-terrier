	<brief_title>Avoidable Readmissions For Patients Hospitalized With Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Objectives The purpose study develop administrative data-based risk prediction model identify potentially avoidable 30-day readmission patient hospitalize community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) . The focus potentially avoidable readmission hospital readmission influence intervention design decrease . The specific aim project : 1. ass accuracy International Classification Disease , Tenth Revision ( ICD-10 ) discharge diagnosis code CAP use structure retrospective chart review reference method . 2. estimate rate all-cause readmission hospital within 30 day one year discharge patient hospitalized CAP . 3. estimate percentage CAP patient die within 30 day one year discharge without hospital readmission . 4. estimate percentage unplanned readmission patient hospitalized CAP use structure retrospective chart review . 5. describe pneumonia-related -unrelated reason readmission patient hospitalize CAP use structure retrospective chart review . 6. quantify probability unplanned readmission avoidable use latent class analysis base independent classification four reviewer . 7. investigate distribution potentially avoidable readmission time since discharge index hospital admission . 8. identify characteristic derive administrative claim data independently associate potentially avoidable readmission . 9. derive internally validate administrative claim data-based risk prediction model identify potentially avoidable 30-day readmission patient hospitalized CAP . 10. identify characteristic abstract medical record independently associate potentially avoidable readmission . 11. derive internally validate medical record data-based risk prediction model identify potentially avoidable 30-day readmission patient hospitalized CAP . 12. compare overall accuracy , discrimination , calibration administrative claim data-based versus medical record data-based risk prediction model identify potentially avoidable 30-day readmission patient hospitalized CAP . 13. externally validate publish risk prediction model potentially avoidable 30-day readmission . II . Study design R3P retrospective observational cohort study consecutive adult patient discharge two hospital diagnosis code CAP . Data source include routinely collect hospital discharge data retrospective chart review . III . Participating study center set The study conduct university-affiliated general hospital Northern Alps , France . With capacity 1,362 acute care bed , Grenoble university hospital serve predominantly urban population 675,000 inhabitant report 135,999 stay 2014 . Annecy general hospital capacity 896 acute care bed report 70,651 stay 2014 . IV . Data collection Two clinical research assistant perform structure retrospective chart review use computerized data collection instrument . The following variable record index hospitalization : - patient hospital stay identifier ; - baseline patient characteristic , include demographic , preexist comorbid condition , pneumonia severity index ( PSI ) risk class , physical examination laboratory finding admission , X-ray CT-scan finding within 48 hour admission , initial microbiological work-up ; - inhospital antibiotic therapy associate treatment ; - index hospital admission course ( ICU admission , pneumonia-related -unrelated complication ) ; - physical examination laboratory finding discharge ; - discharge plan treatment ; The following variable record first readmission within one year discharge : - patient hospital stay identifier ; - physical examination laboratory finding readmission , X-ray CT-scan finding within 48 hour readmission ; - ICU admission ; - pneumonia-related -unrelated complication ; - primary secondary reason readmission . As part French diagnosis-related group ( DRG ) -based prospective payment system , computerized hospital discharge data include patient hospital stay identifier , admission discharge date , age , gender , length stay , discharge location , primary secondary ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code ( 99 ) index hospitalization readmission . ICD-10 cod complies national guideline do trained technician physician , depend hospital . Coders usually abstract diagnosis physician note , although admission note , daily progress note , consultation report , diagnostic imaging , treatment routinely record medical chart . Discharge data externally audit reabstracting random sample hospital stay every year . V. Data management To ensure optimal quality , data collect retrospectively chart review enter electronically clinical research assistant use personal identification code password-protected web-based data collection system . The clinical research assistant receive formal training method data abstraction recording . An operation manual include definition acceptable data source variable distribute . Reliability data abstraction assess randomly select case independent collection practice physician . VI . Statistical analysis 1 . Overview The administrative hospital discharge datasets link medical record-abstracted case use patient hospital stay identifier . If patient admit study period , first hospitalization include index admission . 2 . Accuracy ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code CAP The accuracy ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code assess use three reference method : 1 . Medical record and/or discharge letter notation CAP diagnosis . 2 . Medical record notation ≥ 1 respiratory symptom ( cough , sputum production , dyspnea , tachypnea , pleuritic pain ) , ≥ 1 auscultation finding ( rales crepitation ) , ≥ 1 sign infection ( temperature &gt; 38°C , shiver , white blood cell count &gt; 10,000/µL &lt; 4,000/µL ) , new infiltrate chest radiography CT-scan perform within 48 hour admission . 3 . A composite # and/or # b Positive predictive value point estimate along 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) report three reference method , separately . 3 . Assignment reason readmission Four physician , member clinical review panel , independently review medical record index hospitalization readmission . The member panel general internist , infectious respiratory disease specialist clinical experience manage CAP patient . Consistent Jasti et al . ( CID 2008 ; 46:550-6 ) , physician reviewer use predefined criterion categorize reason rehospitalization : 1. pneumonia-related worsening sign symptom ; 2. new worsen comorbid condition ( ) independent pneumonia ; 3. combination pneumonia-related comorbidity-related reason . The reviewer independently assign primary reason readmission , use mutually exclusive category publish Halfon et al . ( J Clin Epidemiol 2002 ; 55:573-87 ) . Inter-rater agreement reason rehospitalization quantify use Cohen 's Kappa . 4 . Identifying potentially avoidable readmission Consistent van Walraven et al . ( CMAJ 2011 ; 183 : e1067-72 ) , four physician reviewer use 6-point ordinal scale rate whether readmission adverse event whether adverse event could avoid . A readmission rating three domain classify potentially avoidable reviewer . The probability readmission avoidable quantify use latent class analysis base independent classification four reviewer . 5 . Development medical record data-based risk prediction model We derive multivariable logistic regression model quantify likelihood 30-day readmission avoidable . The development sample include cause 30 day readmission adult patient hospitalized CAP . The outcome interest potentially avoidable readmission within 30 day discharge . We use medical record-abstracted data index hospitalization readmission . Candidate predictor identify combine finding systematic literature review opinion field expert . 6 . Development administrative claim data-based risk prediction model In separate analysis , derive multivariable logistic regression model quantify likelihood 30-day readmission avoidable . The development sample include cause 30 day readmission adult patient hospitalized CAP . The outcome interest potentially avoidable readmission within 30 day discharge . We use administrative data model base combination diagnostic code index hospitalization readmission . Candidate predictor identify review publish model combination opinion field expert . 7 . Internal validation risk-prediction model We use bootstrapping quantify optimism apparent performance clinical prediction model . Discrimination quantify concordance ( c ) statistic . Calibration investigate graphically formally assess calibration slope test . VII . Harms safety In retrospective observational study , severe adverse event collect structured chart review , include inhospital mortality , complication due CAP CAP management , new worsen comorbidity , ICU admission , out-of-hospital mortality . VIII . Auditing Monitoring study process document conduct personnel designate Direction de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation ( DRCI ) Grenoble university hospital .</detailed_description>
