	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect budesonide ( use Symbicort budesonide formoterol ) fluticasone ( use Advair fluticasone salmeterol ) airway microorganisms patient moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . This randomize , parallel group , two-centered clinical trial study evaluate effect 12 week treatment Symbicort 400 mcg BID Advair 250 mcg BID ( via Diskus ) airway microbiota patient moderate-to-severe COPD .

	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Differential Effects Inhaled Symbicort Advair Lung Microbiota</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , non-placebo control study evaluate effect Symbicort 400 mcg twice daily ( BID ) Advair 250 mcg BID 12 week . As standard therapy COPD long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) treatment , placebo group ethically justify . The control arm study thus Oxeze 12 ug BID . The study recruit approximately 69 subject , St. Paul 's Hospital British Columbia Cancer Agency , randomize 1:1:1 3 arm block . We anticipate 10 15 % drop rate , enable approximately 60 subject full analysis . After initial enrolment confirmation entry criterion , subject perform spirometry follow bronchodilation salbutamol ( 400 ug ) . They enter 4-week run-in period subject withdraw inhale corticosteroid contain product . They treat formoterol via Turbuhaler 12 ug BID short-acting beta-2 agonist need ( PRN ) . Subjects may also LAMA ( either tiotropium 18 ug daily glycopyrronium 50 ug daily ) discretion attend physician . At end run-in phase , eligibility confirm subject undergo pre post-spirometry , low-dose thoracic compute tomography ( CT ) bronchoscopy . One week post-bronchoscopy , subject randomize 12-week treatment period . Subjects may also LAMA discretion attend physician . At end 12 week treatment period , subject undergo pre- post-spirometry 2nd bronchoscopy . The subject re-evaluated one week follow bronchoscopy discharge study . All subject pulmonary nodule require follow-up evaluate attend physician pulmonary nodule investigate per guideline Fleischner Society .</detailed_description>
