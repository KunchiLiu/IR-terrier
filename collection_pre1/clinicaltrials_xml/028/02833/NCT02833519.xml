	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman current previous history depression and/or anxiety significantly increase risk perinatal depression disruption mother-infant attachment . In addition , pregnant woman anxiety and/or depression high risk preterm birth , low birth weight , complication birth . It well describe physical exercise general associate psychological well-being reduce risk morbidity mortality non-pregnant woman . Several study document physical exercise pregnancy associate health benefit infant mother . Physical exercise pregnancy associate low risk pregnancy- delivery related complication preeclampsia , gestational diabetes mellitus , low back pain , preterm delivery , emergency caesarean section postpartum depression , well contribute improve mood . Nevertheless , exist literature small study examine effect exercise depression among mentally vulnerable pregnant woman . The aim study examine effect supervise group train pregnant woman current previous history depression and/or anxiety . Patient enrollment . The participant recruit Department Obstetrics , Rigshospitalet , Denmark , July 2016 March 2019 . Participants select basis 1 ) information provide participant general practitioner 2 ) electronic questionnaire receive email complete pregnant woman register give birth Rigshospitalet . The information questionnaire routinely transfer pregnant women´s medical record . The first contact participant make phone 12-14 week gestation , , part routine care , mentally vulnerable pregnant woman contact midwife Department Obstetrics , Rigshospitalet . In interview , pregnant woman give brief information trial . If woman interested information , write participant information trial send . If pregnant woman would like participate project , appointment personal meeting make , participant give information project write , informed consent obtain randomization take place . Data collection management . Questionnaire number one , baseline data : participant complete baseline-questionnaire electronically data store secured database . Questionnaire number two ( 29-34 week gestation ) questionnaire number three ( two month give birth ) : two questionnaire send participant email electronically answer questionnaire store secured database . Other data obtain patient record . Sample size . The calculation make base primary endpoint , World Health Organisation Five Well-being Index ( WHO-5 ) 29-34 week gestation . The WHO-5 wellbeing index score range 0-100 , 100 best possible wellbeing . The average value measure WHO-5 wellbeing index 10-12 week gestation 62 point standard deviation ( SD ) 16 . This previously assess among pregnant woman University Hospital , Rigshospitalet . For calculation 29-34 week gestation use SD observe 10-12 week gestation . The investigator expect effect intervention cause 10 point high WHO-5 index score intervention group control group gestational week 29-34 , clinically significant ( `` Guide well-being index : WHO-5 '' , Danish Health Authority ) . It estimate 50 % participant follow program least 75 % session ( high participation , 19-24 session ) 35 % follow 50-75 % session ( moderate participation , 12-18 session ) 15 % follow less half session ( low participation ) . The investigator expect high participation train course lead increase 10 point WHO-5 wellbeing index , moderate participation training course lead increase 7 point , low participation lead increase 2 point , compare control group . This lead average value intervention group 7.75 point ( 0.50 x 10 + 0.35 x 7 + 0.15 x 2 ) high average value control group . With power 90 % two-sided significance level 5 % , difference wellbeing-level 7.75 point ( SD = 16 ) two group 29 - 34 week gestation detect two-sample t-test 91 patient group . The investigator expect necessary include total 300 pregnant woman , investigator anticipate 12.5 % group drop discomfort complication related pregnancy 30 % remain 130 participant group answer questionnaire 29-34 week gestation , leave 91 participant group . Data analysis . The primary data analysis perform basis intention-to-treat principle . The investigator compare baseline data two group Student 's t-test , chi-square test non-parametric test . A large proportion miss value outcome variable expect due drop non-response questionnaire . Data assume Missing At Random ( MAR ) therefore observe patient characteristic use impute miss data , mean multiple imputation . While expect drop-out 12.5 % group , pregnant woman participate group train time , investigator perform per-protocol analysis pregnant woman perform ≥ 75 % training session , addition intention-to-treat analysis . A pilot study 9 woman intervention group 11 woman control group , carry April - June 2016 .</detailed_description>
