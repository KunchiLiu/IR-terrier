	<brief_title>Enhancing Quality Life Through Exercise : A Tele-Rehabilitation Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults spinal cord injury ( SCI ) report low level quality life ( e.g. , low life satisfaction ; high depression ) general population low rate community participation . One health behavior improve psychosocial outcomes physical activity ( PA ) . Unfortunately , PA rate low among adults SCI . Novel intervention increase PA need . One approach gain traction video-based tele-rehabilitation , benefit reducing cost , increase accessibility service deliver adapt intervention person 's home environment . Experts strongly recommend PA intervention base psychological theory enhance effectiveness . The intervention ground strong psychological/motivational theory call self-determination theory ( SDT ) . According SDT , human strive growth well-being aiming satisfy three basic psychological need autonomy ( sense volition ) , competence ( sense capability ) relatedness ( sense connectedness ) . The investigator intervention therefore design foster psychological need order increase intrinsic/autonomous motivation PA , promote high PA level improve quality life participation . To date , study either conduct video-based tele-rehabilitation intervention promote PA test SDT among adults SCI ; thus provide need pilot intervention . The purpose study pilot test innovative , theory-informed , video-based tele-rehabilitation intervention aim enhance SDT-variables , PA quality life-related variable among adult SCI . Effect size derive pilot intervention use inform sample size calculation subsequent large randomize control trial . Given previous video-based PA tele-rehabilitation intervention exist , hypotheses derive PA general telephone-based counselling study . Specifically , hypothesize video-based intervention moderate effect SDT variable , PA , participation , life satisfaction depression .</detailed_description>
