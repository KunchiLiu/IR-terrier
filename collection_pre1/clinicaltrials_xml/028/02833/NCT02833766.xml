	<brief_summary>The main objective trial determine efficacy doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR immunoliposomes first-line therapy patient advanced triple Negative , EGFR positive breast cancer . In proof concept trial , patient administration doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR immunoliposomes ( anti-EGFR-IL-dox ) every 28 day , progression unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes Loaded With Doxorubicin Patients With Advanced Triple Negative EGFR Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) highly chemosensitive disease display dismal short-term prognosis three quarter patient progression 12 month initiation conventional chemotherapy . Approximately 2/3 TNBC express EGFR breast cancer , include TNBC , disease highly sensitive anthracyclines . Furthermore , data phase I trial , 26 patient different solid tumor , show little toxicity sign efficacy anti-EGFR-IL-dox . The EGFR assessment perform centrally patient EGFR positive tumor include . The patient treat anti-EGFR-IL-dox progression followed-up accord standard practice patient TNBC .</detailed_description>
