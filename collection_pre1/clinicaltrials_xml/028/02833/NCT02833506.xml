	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect sirolimus NY-ESO-1 protein MIS416 treat patient stage II-IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Sirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vaccine therapy , like Y-ESO-1 protein MIS416 , may strengthen immune system find kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , sirolimus , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving sirolimus vaccine therapy may work bet treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II-IV Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine safety feasibility NY-ESO-1 protein MIS416 combination mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor sirolimus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness combinatorial therapy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity : peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ CD4+ T-cells ; peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibody ; peripheral blood frequency CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) + regulatory T-cells ; explore time disease progression . OUTLINE : COHORT I ( C1 ) : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein MIS416 vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 15 , 29 , 57 , 85 , 113 absence disease progression toxicity . COHORT II ( C2 ) : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein MIS416 vaccine Cohort I . Patients also receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) daily 2 week follow 2 week start day 1 , 29 , 57 , 85 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 12 month .</detailed_description>
