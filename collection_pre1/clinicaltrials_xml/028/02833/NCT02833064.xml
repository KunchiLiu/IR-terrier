	<brief_summary>Acute liver injury ( ALI ) acute liver failure ( ALF ) rare clinical condition , latter often associate poor outcome . To improve outcome patient , clinician need develop clear understand pathophysiology condition . Biomarkers novel image technique vital investigate understanding pathophysiology ALI . Patients ALI ALF age 16 due cause eligible take part study . The study involve collection biological sample ( blood , urine , stool breath ) include patient daily 7 day . For patient undergo liver transplantation , small sample explanted ( remove ) liver tissue obtain . A small subgroup patient paracetamol induced acute liver failure eligible include pilot MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) study , involve two MRI scan first 7 day admission . All patient recruit Royal Infirmary Edinburgh .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For inpatient , investigator wish collect biological sample patient daily first seven day admission . 25mls blood take daily research purpose , time routine clinical sample reduce discomfort additional venepuncture . One urine sample take daily ( take catheter patient catheter place ) , sample stool patient move bowel . The investigator wish collect breath analysis , one point first seven day admission . Breath analysis require patient fast four hour ( exception water ) prior test . If patient undergoes liver transplantation admission , small sample explanted liver tissue obtain later analysis . For outpatient ( acute liver injury , stable cirrhotics , non-cirrhotic liver disease ) , investigator ask attend ward outpatient department collection biological sample . The investigator take 25 ml blood , along urine stool sample able provide first attendance . Breath analysis also undertaken visit hospital , 4 hour fast ( exception water ) . Outpatients ask return one month later , blood ( 25mls ) , urine stool sample collect . As pilot study , investigator wish perform MRI scan subset 10 patient paracetamol induce acute liver failure . Paracetamol induce acute liver failure associate particularly rapid course , characterise hepatic encephalopathy renal impairment . In view potential renal impairment , intravenous contrast use scan , alternative technique employ artertial spin labelling . The participant need consent individual part study able take part .</detailed_description>
