	<detailed_description>One four woman report bothersome symptom pelvic floor disorder 16 % reporting urinary incontinence ( UI ) . Sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) approve men woman urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , urgency frequency syndrome , urinary retention anal incontinence , procedure design deliver electrical pulse sacral nerve , thereby influence bladder , sphincter , pelvic floor . SNM provide symptomatic relief 70-86 % patient undergoing procedure UUI accord several recent prospective study . Although success rate quite high , precise mechanism action SNM subject UUI remain unclear . Moreover , little data regard specific patient characteristic may serve `` predictor '' SNM success . The microbiome refers genetic material micro-organisms present particular environment . The role microbiome recently implicate several disease state ( obesity , inflammatory bowel disease , functional bowel disease . Initially , urinary microbiome part `` human microbiome project '' widely accept urine sterile . However , recent study note presence urinary microbiota adult woman without clinical urinary tract infection . Furthermore , recent study show urinary microbiome differs among woman UUI versus without UUI also among woman interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome versus without . These study suggest urinary microbiome play role development continuation urinary symptom . Because invasiveness SNM procedure , would helpful way predict treatment success . Investigators study propose urinary microbiome may change woman SNM implantation hope describe change conduct study . Investigators also hope determine difference urinary microbiome exist woman positive response SNM treatment ( responder ) compare without symptom improvement ( non-responders ) . This hypothesis test collect urine sample subject UUI already plan undergo SNM part clinical care SNM treatment .</detailed_description>
