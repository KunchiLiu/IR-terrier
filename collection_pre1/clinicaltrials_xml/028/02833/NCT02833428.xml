	<brief_summary>The aim study analyze use artificial intelligence engine ( IA ) influence pathophysiological environment ( set parametric monitoring data , imaging , biology etc . ) acute spinal cord trauma spinal pain . This project seek establish principle new approach study spinal cord injury patient . It meet usual criterion clinical trial far test patient effect therapeutic</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Artificial Intelligence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective multiple : 1 . Analyze clinical situation pathophysiology spinal pain . 2. somatosensory evoke potential analysis ( PES ) motor ( PEM ) injuries spinal cord acute phase . 3 . Increasing mass data integrate current standard ( volume ) . The reason imperative statistical power conventional test probability specific event characterize type pathology consequence management ( monitor therapeutic ) . 4 . Identify new predictive parameter monitor spinal pain . 5 . Design tool computer collection , successful storage format , adaptation collection tool : This validation technical solution ( i.e . IA ) . Expected result This system allow record analyze large amount parameter , largely beyond human resource . Analysis data allow well understanding pathophysiology acute trauma spinal cord essential prerequisite research new therapy . The realization evoke potential , ever conduct patient acute phase also allow investigator well understand mechanisms evolution SCI ( Spinal Cord Injury ) . Moreover , model expert system must allow , creation routine , discover new predictive parameter monitoring , improve management patient . This completely open system enrich new parameter enrich also inclusion new case . It therefore offer theoretical field infinite discovery extremely promising .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient acute spinal cord injury cord opposite vertebra C2 marrow compare T12 vertebra . neurological lesion classify A , B , C D accord Frankel classification initial examination ( Annex 1 ) . Patient able give inform consent There exclusion criterion . All patient meet inclusion criterion includable . However , differs remarkable different situation : The clinical neurological assessment patient may difficult depend context : intubated patient admit ventilated multiple trauma . Neurological assessment via evoked potential may difficult depend environment patient care : need multiple investigation , resuscitation . Evoked potential instal agreement healthcare team patient stabilize . The patient refuse submit one additional exam part standard care ( i.e . PES / PEM ) ; offer participate study without completion review . It case simple use clinical laboratory data collect retrospectively anonymized scientific purpose .</criteria>
