	<brief_summary>Approximately half patient receive treatment chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection United States advance liver disease . Patients advance fibrosis/cirrhosis achieve sustain virological response ( SVR ) treatment clinically cure HCV continue elevate risk develop hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . According guideline several professional society American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) , particular , patient advance fibrosis/cirrhosis undergo life-long bi-annual screening incident HCC whether achieve SVR , . The number patient need post-SVR HCC screen rise dramatically recent year due confluence three factor : Increased screen HCV , allow people realize often `` silent '' infection ; availability safe highly effective direct act antiviral drug ( DAAs ) HCV , allow much high percentage treat patient achieve SVR ; long duration HCV infection many patient , allow enough time advance fibrosis/cirrhosis develop . To investigate post-SVR patient era DAAs promote HCC screening , objective study conduct randomize , unblinded , two-arm prospective intervention trial compare rate HCC screen patient randomize either personalized patient navigation automate reminder ( e.g . electronic mail ) . Both intervention represent improve care current standard care ( patient navigation automate reminder ) . There evidence suggest one intervention well . Healthcare provider agree participate study contact confirm liver disease status patient clinical trial provider patient arm trial send reminder need schedule patient screen visit .</brief_summary>
