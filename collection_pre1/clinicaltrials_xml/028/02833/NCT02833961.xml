	<brief_summary>Cerebral vascular disorder one fatal diseases despite current advance medical science . The large number negative clinical trial neuroprotection acute stroke pointer fact translate good understand pathogenesis pathophysiology clearly beneficial treatment strategy remain daunt task . This project aim elucidate plausible biophysical event affect water metabolite diffusion brain tissue ischemia , combine information provide two advanced method magnetic resonance ( MR ) diffusion imaging : diffusional kurtosis image diffusion-weighted spectroscopy . Diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) establish major tool early detection stroke . However , information obtain use conventional DWI may incomplete . Diffusional kurtosis ( K ) quantitative measure complexity heterogeneity microenvironment white grey matter , offer complementary information may potentially sensitive biomarker probe pathophysiological change . In addition , gain specific insight molecular mobility intracellular environment , beneficial ass diffusion property metabolites , N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , creatine phosphocreatine ( Cr ) , choline contain compound ( Cho ) . Assessment metabolite diffusion change diffusion-weighted spectroscopy ( DWS ) provide information specific intracellular environment . In particular , thanks specific compartmentation NAA almost exclusively neuron Cho glial cell , diffusion property metabolites may provide specific insight pathological process occur independently two cell type . In addition , measure temporal profile diffusion coefficient compound may help clarify underlying pathophysiological change neuronal cell acute ischemia . With help two advanced method , proof-of-concept trial propose 24 healthy subject 24 ischemic stroke patient . Ischemic stroke patient scan three time 3T MR scanner ( day 10 post-stroke , around week 4 3 month ) , order extract diffusion kurtosis imaging ( DKI ) DWS metric understand dynamic cellular mechanism play cerebral ischemia . The goal study investigate neuronal glial metabolite diffusion change different time point ischemic stroke , infarcted non-infarcted hemisphere . The aim get non-invasively important information evolution cellular damage disease , possibly distinguish neuronal glial process ( measure metric extract two sequence ) , well different mechanism lead metabolite diffusion change two brain area , thus provide great impact strategy treatment patient cerebral infarction .</brief_summary>
