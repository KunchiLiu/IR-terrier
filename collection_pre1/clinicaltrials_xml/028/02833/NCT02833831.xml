	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect ALS-008176 Cardiac Repolarization Interval Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part Phase 1 study consist dose escalation part ( Part 1 ) TQT part ( Part 2 ) , perform two separate panel ( Panels 1 2 ) . Panel 1 double blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , placebo control dose escalation study healthy participant determine safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ALS-008176 administration single dos 1500 milligram ( mg ) , 2500 mg 3000 mg fast condition . The final dose use Panel 2 determine base result dose escalation part . An interim analysis conduct Panel 1 select dose Panel 2 . Panel 2 double blind , double dummy , randomize , 3 period crossover ( medication provide participant different sequence ) , placebo positive control study evaluate effect ALS-008176 QT/QTc interval healthy participant . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
