	<brief_summary>Medical context : Several molecular study show chromosomal alteration patient endometrial cancer , gain 1q , 19p , 19q , 8q , 10q 10p loss 4q , 16q 18q . Several gene interest dentified ( P53 , PTEN , PIK3CA , ÃŸ-catenin , K-ras ... ) . It thus conceivable like enable genomic tool use breast cancer today ( Oncotype DX , MammaPrint ) , correlation tumor profile life project case cancer endometrium could do . A study already underway Reims University Hospital funding League cancer AOL 2010 CHU Reims . It identify specific alteration nosologic continuum pathology characterize area interest genome . To date , 39 patient endometrial cancer 15 patient endometrial hyperplasia ( patient 'cases ' ) include study . For study , 10 patient exhibit neither cancer endometrial hyperplasia also include . Samples 10 patient 'witnesses ' pool serve reference analyze patient 'cases ' . objective : In continuation study begin November 2009 , refine study genomic imbalance highlight hyperplasia endometrial cancer study correlation genomics proteomics immunohistochemical study analyze microsatellite instability . To study prognostic role genetic factor patient carrier disease endometrial ( cancer hyperplasia ) . Material method : Experimental Design : Cross-sectional study inclusion prospective multi-center follow cohort study patient 'cases ' . Population / patient : total , plan include 72 patient hyperplasia endometrial cancer ( 22 patient include pre-study part fund League cancer 50 patient include scope study fund 2010 AOL Chu Reims ) . Plan investigation : study include two phase : Sectional study : The inclusion 10 patient `` witness '' already complete first project . During consultation obstetrics gynecology department Reims University Hospital surgical department institute Jean Godinot , term objective study present patient cancer hyperplasia endometrial diagnose achieve endometrial biopsy . If patient agrees participate study , management pathology ( hysterectomy , hysteroscopy curettage resection ) change . The sample take surgery analyzed provide first research project . Tumor karyotype , DNA extraction perform sample fresh . A comparative genomic hybridization conduct use DNAs thus obtain . Additional analyzes ( immunohistochemistry analysis microsatellite instability ) perform sample already obtain future withdrawal .</brief_summary>
