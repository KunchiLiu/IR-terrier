	<brief_title>The Plasma Serotonin Aortic Stenosis : Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcific aortic stenosis frequent valve disease adult . Without therapeutic strategy , disease lead heart failure death . Surgical aortic valve replacement well tolerated cardiac surgery lead excellent outcome . Until recently , calcific aortic stenosis consider histopathologically degenerative passive origin . It recognize , however , complex cellular process feature atherosclerosis . It observe drug may slow dawn progression aortic stenosis observational study . It suggest serotonin , monoamine neurotransmitter peripheral signal mediator , may involve progression aortic stenosis also consequences myocardium hypertrophy . In blood , serotonin mainly store platelet , release serotonin involve post-injury vasoconstriction , thrombus formation , fibrosis atherogenesis . This study hypothesize patient aortic stenosis exhibit high circulate serotonin level counterpart without heart disease . In addition circulate serotonin , metabolite 5-HIAA systematically measure patient . This study would allow determine potential plasma serotonin prognosis marker perhaps suggest discovery new target treatment aortic stenosis .</detailed_description>
