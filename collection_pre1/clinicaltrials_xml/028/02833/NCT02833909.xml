	<detailed_description>The objective investigate ex vivo inflammatory response hidradenitis suppurativa ( activation inflammasome , role pro-inflammatory cytokine ) skin patient treat surgically disease . The investigator hypothesize Th17-derived cytokine , especially IL-17 , could serve relay inflammatory process lead HS severity recurrences.To fulfil proposal , investigator aim demonstrate characterize presence inflammasome associate HS disease - Hypothesis It widely accept hyperkeratinisation follicular occlusion originate infection thereof cause skin inflammation . The investigator hypothesize host-derived danger signal lead release inflammatory mediator IL-1β activate inflammasome structure . The inflammasome molecular platform control expression activation IL-1β via different sensor . The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β could subsequently lead recruitment orientation lymphocytes towards Th17 subtype create feedback loop maintain excessive tissue inflammation HS . If complex inflammatory process present HS , block bacterial-induced ( IL-1 β ) sterile-associated ( IL-17 ) inflammation would largely improve therapeutic benefit HS patient . - Experimental approach The investigator seek highlight presence inflammasome sensor effector skin explants HS compare control skin . For original physiopathological study , 10 lesional skin excise HS patient control ( plastic surgery ) sign informed consent require ethical review board ( CPP accept 23-01-2015 ) investigate . HS disease severity base stag accord Hurley staging . Six mm skin punch harvest control explants situ peri-lesional site HS skin explants . Skin sample handle either straight forwardly ( day 0 ) period tissue culture 4 day w/out treatment . All experiment conduct follow : - Ex vivo skin tissue sample insert Transwell® filter culture period 4 day w/out antibiotic ( Rifampicin , Clindamycin ) . - Both day 0 day 4 : - one set skin sample embed analyze presence inflammasome sensor effector immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) - Another set homogenize cytokine determination ( ELISA ) cell stimulation ( see ) - Homogenized sample treat anti-cytokine antibody ( Secukinumab v isotype ) 4 hour addition keratinocytes cell line monocyte/macrophage cell line . The influence IL-17 bacterial infection inflammasome activation cell line investigate describe associated PCR technique .</detailed_description>
