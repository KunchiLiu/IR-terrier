	<brief_summary>The Click-Mid-Upper Arm Circumference study aim describe compare performance set three simplify mid-upper arm circumference classification device ( `` Click-MUAC '' ) use mother caregiver screen acute malnutrition young child . The study conduct Isiolo County , Kenya . The study build recent approach training mother screen acute malnutrition child ( mother MUAC approach ) . The primary aim study describe compare performance set three prototype Click-MUAC device gold standard classification , term measure agreement ( sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , Cohen 's Kappa , Youden 's J ) classification ( diagnosis ) acute malnutrition . A secondary aim study determine difference agreement gold standard classification amongst mothers/caregivers use Click-MUAC prototype versus mothers/caregivers use regular MUAC tape . The hypothesis study least one Click-MUAC prototypes equal gold standard classification term measure agreement classification acute malnutrition . A secondary hypothesis study agreement gold standard classification well amongst mothers/caregivers use Click-MUAC prototype compare mothers/caregivers use regular MUAC tape . The outcome study use decide whether production Click-MUAC device desirable , case , select design base performance prototype device state preference intend user .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Performance Simplified Mid-Upper Arm Circumference Devices ( `` Click-MUACs '' ) Detect Acute Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study non-randomised , non-blinded , clinical diagnostic trial describe compare performance conduct two phase : ( ) calibration device , ( ii ) test Click-MUAC prototype `` gold standard '' classification . The study take place designate health facility within Isiolo County already IMAM programme run . The investigator expect health facility high number acute malnutrition admission select study site order able test prototype large number attend Severe Acute Malnutrition ( SAM ) /Moderate Acute Malnutrition ( MAM ) child . The first phase work concentrate calibration Click-MUAC prototype . The performance Click-MUAC prototypes regard accuracy classification assess child measure MUAC close 115 mm 125 mm case-defining threshold . This phase work require prior test Click-MUAC prototype perform semi-rigid testing tube . The second phase work test Click-MUAC prototype . Three set measurements/classifications take Click-MUAC test trial : ( ) Mother/caregiver MUAC classification perform mother/primary caregiver child , use three Click-MUAC prototype regular MUAC tape ; ( ii ) IMAM staff MUAC classification perform Integrated Management Acute malnutrition ( IMAM ) staff child , use three Click-MUAC prototype regular MUAC tape ; ( iii ) Gold standard MUAC measurement perform study coordinator and/or data collection team member train measurement MUAC select accuracy ( i.e . study supervisor ) precision measurement , follow validation exercise use Habicht method , child . In addition , mothers/caregivers IMAM staff also ask state preference Click-MUAC prototype ask give reason preference . The Click-MUAC device screening/diagnostic device . Appropriate measure agreement different measurer group ( mothers/primary caregiver , IMAM staff , gold standard ) calculate two-by-two contingency table . The following appropriate measure agreement calculate table : sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , Cohen ' Kappa , Younden 's J . The analysis ( i.e . two-by-two contingency table estimation appropriate measure agreement ) perform prototype Click-MUAC device . A discordancy analysis also perform . The aim discordancy analysis describe misclassifications term range , interquartile range , median MUAC type discordancy . This analysis provide calibration information may inform design change avoid/minimize gross misclassifications minimize frequency error make close class boundary .</detailed_description>
