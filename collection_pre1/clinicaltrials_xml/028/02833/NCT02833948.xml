	<brief_summary>The aortic valve locate leave ventricle aorta . Patients symptomatic , severe aortic valve stenosis conventionally surgically replace require direct access heart chest . Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) well-established alternative treating severe aortic valve stenosis . Both type intervention improve prognosis alleviate symptom . The optimal choice blood thin therapy TAVR unknown . It report leaflet thrombosis reduce leaflet motion occur phenomenon suggest potentially related neurological event . In addition , occurence phenomenon reduce anticoagulation blood thin therapy . The purpose study evaluate anticoagulation compare usual double platelet inhibitor therapy TAVR reduce risk leaflet thrombosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Rivaroxaban-based Strategy With Antiplatelet-based Strategy Following Successful TAVR Prevention Leaflet Thickening Reduced Leaflet Motion Evaluated Four-dimensional , Volume-rendered Computed Tomography ( 4DCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) become establish therapeutic option patient symptomatic , severe aortic valve stenosis , ineligible high risk conventional surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) . It recently report leaflet thickening reduce leaflet motion , verify four-dimensional computed tomography ( 4DCT ) , uncommon TAVR SAVR . It emphasize phenomenon investigated effect clinical outcome ( e.g . stroke ) valve durability . As valve leaflet thicken reduce motion could reverse oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) treatment observe patient chronic OAC therapy , hypothesize phenomenon could relate possible leaflet thrombosis `` thrombotic film '' leaflet . AIM : To evaluate whether rivaroxaban-based strategy , follow successful TAVR , compare antiplatelet-based strategy , superior reduce subclinical valve leaflet thicken motion abnormality - detect 4DCT-scan . POPULATION : All patient undergo successful TAVR ileofemoral subclavian access approve TAVR device screen eligibility . Included subject must provide write informed consent . Inclusion exclusion criterion list . DESIGN : The GALILEO-4D trial conduct substudy multicenter , open-label , randomize , event-driven , active-controlled GALILEO trial . Patients 1:1 randomized antiplatelet-based strategy vs. rivaroxaban-based strategy - randomization adopt 1:1 randomization main GALILEO trial . In case GALILEO-4D trial still continue completion main GALILEO trial , 1:1 randomization continue inclusion 150 patient treatment group . In total , 300 patient randomize GALILEO-4D trial . INTERVENTION : Subjects GALILEO-4D substudy receive intervention main GALILEO study . In addition , 4DCT-scan echocardiography perform 90 day randomization . END POINTS : The primary endpoint constitutes rate patient least one prosthetic leaflet &gt; 50 % motion reduction assess cardiac 4DCT-scan ( total N = 300 ) . The secondary endpoint list .</detailed_description>
