	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ascorbic acid give together bevacizumab treat patient high grade glioma come back ( recurrent ) . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Ascorbic acid contain ingredient may prevent slow growth high grade glioma . Giving bevacizumab ascorbic acid together may work well treat patient high grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Ascorbic Acid Patients Treating With Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity determine recommend dose intravenous ascorbic acid give three time weekly combination intravenous bevacizumab every two week patient recurrent high grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change level serum ascorbic acid ( use high performance liquid chromatography [ HPLC ] coulometric electrochemical detection ) therapy ascorbic acid bevacizumab . II . Radiographic assessment disease status 2 cycle therapy ascorbic acid bevacizumab . III . To evaluate progression-free overall survival patient recurrent high grade glioma treat therapy ascorbic acid bevacizumab . Patients stable responsive disease every 2 cycle continue therapy ascorbic acid bevacizumab intolerance progressive disease . IV . To descriptively examine quality life ( QOL ) use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ascorbic acid . Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously ( IV ) 90-120 minute three time per week ( least 24 hour apart ) bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
