	<brief_title>Study MRI Monitoring Patients With Aplastic Anemia Low Int-1 Risk MDS Complicated With Iron Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-term transfusion therapy , support treatment patient intractable chronic anemia currently frequent cause secondary iron overload . Both Aplastic anemia ( AA ) low risk ( low intermediate-1 risk ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) classify bone marrow failure syndrome ( BMFs ) lot character common . Iron overload ( IOL ) become significant problem regularly transfuse patient , lead organ damage , particularly liver heart . Iron overload also suppressive effect erythroid progenitor may increase transfusion requirement . In case , iron chelation therapy may help improve quality life prolong survival . Because importance iron chelation patient AA low intermediate-1 ( int-1 ) risk MDS complicate iron overload , necessary monitor iron overload status find suitable patient chelate follow effectiveness therapy . Using quantitative Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) T2* detect iron deposit different organ introduce China since 5 year ago . Compared traditional method evaluate iron overload like clinical manifestation , serum ferritin ( SF ) level , transferrin saturation ( TS ) , CT echocardiography ( UCG ) etc. , widely use far China , MRI T2* provide accurate , convenient affordable non-invasive way monitoring iron overload . More important , reliable monitor improvement iron chelation therapy since variation MRI detection different detection low . Few report focus IOL MDS AA China far . Measurement liver iron concentration ( LIC ) MRI yield similar result come liver biopsy analysis , validate tool detection iron overload . Data publish multi-center trial evaluate efficacy safety deferasirox ( DFX ) low intermediate-1 risk MDS patient transfusion-dependent IOL show DFX yield sufficient reduction excess iron indicate serum ferritin level importantly liver MRI . But median duration DFX treatment 354 day data Chinese patient include . Most study MDS lack data long term follow-up scarcely data AA far . In China , patient iron overload afford adequate iron chelation therapy , although still patient afford chelate irregularly . And patient accept deferoxamine instead deferasirox medical insurance policy . It important include patient different situation monitor iron change major organ base different chelation level . In study , anticipate evaluate prospectively 80 patient AA low int-1 risk MDS IOL , traditional method MRI T2* . Clinical parameter T2*values monitor every 12 month 3 year . Other parameter like clinical follow-up ( rate infection , liver disease , cardiac disorder , endocrine function co-morbidities associate MDS/AAs , etc . ) , SF , liver kidney function , UCG test monitor well interval every 6 month . At end study , patient classify well chelate group ( define receive deferasirox 20mg/kg deferoxamine 40 mg/kg 255 days/year ) poor chelate group ( define receive iron chelation therapy dose less ) compare difference outcome change iron status . The investigator aim give overview IOL patient AA low int-1 risk MDS sequelae different chelation treatment . And investigator also aim evaluate relationship LIC T2*/R2* . It first longest prospective clinical trial AA low risk MDS give u good understand value proper chelation treatment organ function .</detailed_description>
