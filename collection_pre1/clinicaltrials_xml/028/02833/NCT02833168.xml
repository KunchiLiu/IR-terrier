	<brief_title>Screening Questionnaire Respiratory Muscle Weakness Sleep-disordered Breathing Neuromuscular Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SDB promiment clinical feature various neuromuscular disorder include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) , myopathies myotonic dystrophy type 1 , Pompe disease , limb-girdle muscular dystrophy ( LGMD ) . In ALS , SMA , LGMD Pompe disease , SDB usually cause nocturnal alveolar hypoventilaton due diaphragmatic weakness manifest first sleep REM sleep particular . SDB usually lead sleep disruption , non-restorative sleep daytime symptom include morning headache , hypersomnolence , increase neuromuscular fatigue . In patient severe diaphragmatic involvement symptom SDB potential complication respiratory muscle weakness substantially add overall disease burden disease decrease life span . Diagnosis SDB establish mean sleep study ideally comprise polysomnography ( PSG ) transcutaneous capnography . PSG capnometry time-consuming , expensive readily available patient refer physician , respectively . For reason desirable thoroughly screen patient neuromuscular disease symptom SDB respiratory muscle weakness . Results validate screen questionnaire could use adjunctive pulmonary function test spirometry result order identify patient sleep study perform . In addition , screen questionnaire would facilitate early recognition patient SDB , enable treat physician take appropriate step establish diagnosis initiate non-invasive ventilation early possible . Until , validated German language screen questionnaire symptom respiratory muscle weakness SDB . Steier et al . publish English language questionnaire validate screen tool 33 patient different neuromuscular disorder predominantly neurogenic ( Steier et al . 2011 ) . In study , SDB define apnea hypopnea index 5 per hour . Nocturnal oxygen saturation CO2 monitoring take account . In addition questionnaire systematically cover sleep-related symptom SDB detail ( sleep disruption morning headache ) separate daytime symptom dyspnea orthopnea , respectively . Thus , current project aim correlate comprehensively generate item screen questionnaire sleep study result include capnography alongside respiratory muscle test patient neuromuscular disorder . As control subject , patient newly diagnose obstructive sleep apnea syndrome sleep disorder sleep-related breathing disorder enrol study .</detailed_description>
