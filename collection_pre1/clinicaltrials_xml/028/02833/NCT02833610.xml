Subjects surgically sterile ( e.g . history bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy ) whose sexual partner sterile ( e.g . history vasectomy ) require use additional contraceptive measure . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior administration denosumab . Active IV bisphosphonate use last 3 month . POEMS syndrome ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal protein , skin change ) . Plasma cell leukemia . Prior history current evidence osteonecrosis/osteomyelitis jaw . Active dental jaw condition require oral surgery , include tooth extraction . Nonhealed dental/oral surgery , include tooth extraction . Planned invasive dental procedure course study . Evidence follow condition per subject selfreport medical chart review Any prior invasive malignancy within 5 year enrollment may affect outcome study Any noninvasive malignancy treat curative intent know active disease within 5 year enrollment may affect outcome study Major surgery significant traumatic injury occur within 4 week enrollment Active infection Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus know infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Active infection require IV antiinfective therapy Subject pregnant breast feeding , plan become pregnant within 5 month end treatment .
