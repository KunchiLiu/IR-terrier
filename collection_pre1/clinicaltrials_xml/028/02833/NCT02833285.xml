	<brief_summary>The inflammatory response involve many player immune response , include B lymphocyte . These cell responsible synthesis immunoglobulin response presence antigen . They characteristic chronic inflammation . There several subset B cell characterize specific membrane marker . Once activate , cell express many factor contribute tissue destruction see periodontitis particularly osteoclastogenesis ( receptor activator nuclear factor kappa-B ligand , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-6 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î± Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-3 ) . During establishment periodontal disease , important inflammatory infiltrate observe gum . This infiltrate characterize presence many B lymphocyte . B cell subset blood gum patient periodontitis little studied . However , number autoreactive B cell ( cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19+ , CD5+ ) report high blood patient periodontal disease . In gum , rate B T cell increase level inflammation correlate severity inflammatory process . Activation B cell prerequisite progression gingivitis periodontitis . B cell distribution could indicator disease progression , also allow study response treatment . The aim pilot study characterize B cell subset blood gum patient periodontitis , accord disease activity . Analysis B cell blood could highlight association particular subpopulation aggressive periodontal disease evidence particular biological profile host response . The investigator also wish observe evolution phenotype follow unconventional surgical therapy . This study would better understand pathogenesis periodontal disease refine diagnosis , prognosis treatment periodontitis , thus participate development personalized medicine . Biological monitoring therapeutic effect may initiate allow effectively prevent recurrence .</brief_summary>
