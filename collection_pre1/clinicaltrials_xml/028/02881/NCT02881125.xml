	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose nortriptyline hydrochloride give together paclitaxel treat patient small cell carcinoma come back . Nortriptyline hydrochloride , may help disrupt survival signal cause cancer cell death . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving nortriptyline hydrochloride paclitaxel may work well treat patient small cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Nortriptyline Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) nortriptyline hydrochloride ( nortriptyline ) combine weekly paclitaxel ( PC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) nortriptyline combine weekly PC . II . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study nortriptyline hydrochloride . Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive nortriptyline hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 , twice daily ( BID ) day 8-14 , thrice daily ( TID ) day 15-28 course 1 TID day 1-28 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
