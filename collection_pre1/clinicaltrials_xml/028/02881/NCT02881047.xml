	<criteria>Subjects must able give informed consent All adult patient ( 18 year age old ) Severe sclerotic skin change chronic graft versus host disease meeting score 3 NIH consensus criterion organ score chronic GVHD , score define deep sclerotic feature hidebound skin pinch together , result impaired motion . According NIH criterion , patient need widespread cutaneous GVHD ; hidebound skin OR impair mobility receive score 3 ( high score ) . Demonstrable range motion limitation joint contracture due sclerotic GVHD across specific joint / limb amenable laser therapy must present . Patients must note inability bend joint ( e.g . foot , wrist , elbow ) freely compromise ability perform specific task ( e.g . walk stair , grab / make fist , lift raise thearms head ) . As functional limitation nature subjective ( NIH score criterion subjective ) determination eligibility make investigator .
