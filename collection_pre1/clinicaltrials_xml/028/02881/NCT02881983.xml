This study aim evaluate emotion regulation process , short term ( STA , 1month withdrawal ) long-term alcohol abstinent individual ( LTA , least six month abstinence ) , compare healthy control participant ( C ) positive negative emotion induction protocol . Main aim : Evaluating emotional regulation deficit assess physiological indicator ( heart rate variability , electrodermal response , pupil diameter ) clinically presentation visual stimuli emotional value ( positive , negative , neutral ) alcohol use disorder 's ( AUD ) patient short long term abstinent compare control group healthy subject .
