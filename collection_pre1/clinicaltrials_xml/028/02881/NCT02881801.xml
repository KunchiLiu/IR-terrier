	<brief_summary>This study aim describe pattern active sedentary time survivor critical illness , three time point hospital admission ( awaken ICU ≥ 5 day mechanical ventilation , discharge ward discharge hospital ) . The specific research objectives 1 . Determine duration active sedentary parameter include time bout 24 hour period 2 . Examine change active sedentary parameter include time bout time point awaken ICU hospital discharge . 3 . Conduct preliminary examination relationship activity sedentary behaviour metric measure muscle strength , physical function hospital length stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patterns Physical Activity Sedentary Time Survivors Critical Illness During Hospital Admission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study consecutively sample eligible patient critical illness , require intensive care . This study use two activity monitor ( accelerometer ) measure physical activity sedentary variable patient recover critical illness single tertiary hospital three occasion acute hospital admission . Accelerometer derive measure obtain continuous 24 hour monitoring period patient sufficiently awake attentive within ICU , ICU discharge acute hospital discharge . Measurements patient muscle strength physical function also make time accelerometry .</detailed_description>
