The limitation current obesity treatment lead increased interest endoscopic treatment , may effective pharmacotherapy less invasive reversible bariatric surgery . The AspireAssist® Aspiration Therapy System novel endoscopic therapy develop Aspire Bariatrics Inc. ( King Prussia , United States ) treatment obesity . The system take advantage percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube technology induce weight reduction aspirate portion ingest meal stomach .
