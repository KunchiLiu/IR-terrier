	<detailed_description>I . Background / Rationale For twenty year , surgical discipline , new minimally invasive technique develop main goal reduction muscle trauma associate surround road `` classic '' reduce morbidity link one . More recently , minimally invasive method dedicate spinal surgery establish , treatment herniated disc initially , narrow lumbar canal . The canal release minimally invasive fusion , use tubular system muscle retraction new technique proven effective : post operative pain reduction hospital stay blood loss . The objective study investigate quality ductal release minimally invasive fusion . II . objective . primary objective Evaluating quality discharge postoperative scanner minimally invasive fusion . b. secondary objective . Evaluation rate type early complication minimally invasive technique ii . Evaluation early postoperative result ( postoperative pain , analgesic consumption , length hospital stay , blood loss ) iii . Evaluation clinical outcome short medium term decompression minimally invasive fusion . III . Methodology duration research This retrospective single-center consecutive series multi-operator regard evaluation surgical practice cite goal . Clinical data collect prospectively KEOPS database ( SAMIO ) . All patient include study spinal MRI scanner pre-operative post-operative scan . N = ( number patient period ) / Time Study ? The series patient classify two group : - Foraminal stenosis - Central stenosis The evaluation primary objective criterion compare height foramen measure CT pre- post-operative low edge overlie pedicle top edge pedicle underlie sagittal section . For central stenosis , Postoperative MRI perform volume dural sac compare preoperative MRI axial image .</detailed_description>
