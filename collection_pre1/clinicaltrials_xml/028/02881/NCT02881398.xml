	<detailed_description>A recent paradigm-shift global burden cardiovascular disease observe decrease prevalence industrialize nation increase prevalence resource limit area . This problem compound resource-limited area receive disproportionately low allocation global resource include diagnostic test train healthcare professional . Such cardiovascular condition include heart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial arrhythmia hypertensive heart disease . Coupled rise epidemic rheumatic structural heart disease affect 15- million individual region creates urgent need require innovative scalable method improve population- health , method reduce cost care , simultaneously improve outcome . The World Health Organization 's Millennium Developmental Goals recently report rise cellular phone technology 7-Billion device active circulation . Parallel development globalization Internet-based communication emergence new smartphone-connected mobile health ( mHealth ) device provide new method patient remotely monitor chronic condition provider improve healthcare delivery . These technology include smartphone 'apps ' , wearable wireless device smartphone-ECG , sensor-based technology , pocket-sized ultrasound miniaturize lab-on-a-chip technology . Several design feature mHealth well suit use resource-limited area use practitioner-based diagnostic tool include portability , low cost , simple use form factor . Although attractive method new technology utilization , impact mHealth use practitioner-based clinical-decision-support tool subsequent management outcomes previously evaluate . Several barrier effective healthcare exist resource-limited area require multidisciplinary collaboration community , medical center , health worker patient . Developing new digital program healthcare innovation region bring together collaboration industry , researcher , engineer information technology partner . In aggregate , cumulative effort across several discipline necessary order ass feasibility , utility , impact new device resource constrain area . The investigator describe multidisciplinary global effort across institution India United States . The investigator receive support international medical society device manufacturer advance knowledge technology utilization improve healthcare access outcomes patient resource limited area .</detailed_description>
