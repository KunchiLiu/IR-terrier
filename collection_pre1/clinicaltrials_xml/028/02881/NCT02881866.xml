	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect inhaled furosemide different type breathlessness relief healthy volunteer . Each volunteer inhale mist either furosemide control substance 3 occasion per day 2 separate day . On one day perform one breathlessness test create 'urge breathe ' know air hunger ( AH ) day perform breathlessness test increase sense work/effort ( WE ) breathing . The study double blind neither volunteer research know mist inhale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specificity Dyspnoea Relief With Inhaled Furosemide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . 16 healthy volunteer attend 4 session . After 2 practice session subject undergo 2 test day make feel 'air hunger ' ( hypercapnia constrain ventilation ) mist inhalation one day sense breathe 'effort ' ( raise ventilation external resistive load ) mist inhalation second test day . The mist either furosemide placebo ( saline ) mist . The urge urinate systemic absorption lung account concomitant administration intravenous furosemide saline inhale . Furosemide prescription drug make kidney produce urine . When administered inhalation aerosol direct action lung sensitise slowly adapting stretch receptor believe account relief dyspnoea previously report inhaled furosemide . Vagal afferent pulmonary stretch receptor know involved relief air hunger know also relieve sense breathing effort . Relief breathlessness measure compare two trial day see furosemide specifically relieve 'air hunger ' type breathlessness 'effort ' type breathlessness .</detailed_description>
