	<brief_summary>There significant difference CM LOC ball attachment , consider peri-implant soft tissue health marginal bone loss . The primary secondary objective determine CM LOC attachment improve peri-implant soft tissue response decrease marginal bone loss around implant compare conventional ball attachment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PeriImplant Soft Tissue Marginal Bone Loss Single Implant Mandibular Overdenture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ball attachment commonly use solitary , simple , easy use less technique sensitive compare bar attachment . However , ball attachment require prosthetic space 12 mm could show tremendous wear implant mal-aligned . CM LOC attachment newly introduce market good expectation regard property effect periimplant soft tissue . CM LOC attachment , combes titanium patrix resin matrix make polyetherketoneketone ( PEKK ) , promise material regard wear prosthesis retention provide , even mal-aligned implant . However , clinical performance attachment test yet . Therefore , randomize control trial decide compare CM LOC commonly use ball attachment regard soft tissue health marginal bone loss .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Completely edentulous male female patient age 50 69 . No contraindication implantation . Each patient perform random blood sugar Glycosylated Hemoglobin analysis . Patients Glycosylated hemoglobin test HbA1c 8 % normal blood sugar level ( 79 110 ) control diabetic patient ( 90130 fast accord American Association Diabetes ) include . Sufficient bone width ( â‰¥ 6 mm ) anterior region place implant . It could either normally present achieve bone plateauing . This confirm cone beam compute tomographic ( CBCT ) scan . Residual bone height range 1120 mm low vertical height midline mandible le 13 mm ( Class II III accord McGarry et al [ 16 ] 1999 ) . This confirm CBCT . Patients seek install single symphyseal implant new denture construct . Patients , dissatisfied retention stability technically satisfactory denture . Patients , already exist maxillary mandibular complete denture , examination mandibular denture , find technical problem regard denture design and/or occlusion ; new maxillary mandibular denture fabricate All patient adapt denture least six week include trial . Patients provide write informed consent participate trial do schedule date implant installation . Patients systemic local contraindication implant placement . Satisfied patient retention mandibular denture well unsatisfied patient maxillary denture . Patient mandibular denture height less 6 mm base denture incisal edge central incisor ( measure caliper ) 12 mm crown height space measure ruler incisal edge till crest ridge . This do putty index diagnostic set . Incompliant cooperative patient . Patients smoke 10 cigarette per day .</criteria>
