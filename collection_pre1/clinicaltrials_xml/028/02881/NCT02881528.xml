	<brief_summary>The autoimmune diabetes ACCELERATOR PREVENTION TRIAL ( adAPT ) base accelerator hypothesis . The trial design establish whether metformin , oral hypoglycaemic agent know reduce insulin demand type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , child risk type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) thereby prevent disease . The first phase adAPT screen participant age 5-16 year ( inclusive ) islet-related autoantibody sibling offspring individual diagnose T1D age 25years Scotland England . There four principle islet-related antibody associate T1D . The presence two confers 40 % risk develop T1D five year . While presence none one antibody carry similar risk develop T1D general population ( 1 500 5years ) . It anticipate 5 % screen identified double-antibody positive , participant invite join intervention phase study - randomise control trial ( RCT ) . Up 200 eligible subject could identify screen minimum 90 enrol RCT phase . adAPT propose three stage project . The current protocol defines screen phase , Stage 1 seamless entry Stage 2 . Screening identify child young people high risk develop T1D invite participate Stage 1 involve minimum 4 month treatment either metformin/placebo , however Stage1 treatment run seamlessly Stage 2 . Stage 1/2 treatment last 21 month ( accommodate 15months screening , 4 month treatment 2 month analysis ) . Post Stage1 analysis/ late Stage 2 participation last 36 month ( participant enrol early Stage 1 long intervention ) . During Stage1 participant test three occasion ( baseline , month 1 month 4 ) metabolic response use 5-point mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) . Testing continue Stage 1/2 3 visit visit month 8 , 12 , 18 . Late Stage 2 visit occur month 24 , 30 &amp; 36 . Participants invite continue Stage 3 , take treatment 60 month post analysis Stage 1 associate protocol amendment additional consent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>adAPT randomise double-blind placebo-controlled Phase IV clinical trial . Metformin , license medicine test current license ( off-label ) . Participants either receive metformin ( liquid ) match placebo double blind manner ; neither participant study team know allocation . Metformin , study medication , reduces demand insulin Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . adAPT test metformin also reduce insulin demand child risk Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) . adAPT adaptive design stage inform next progression depend upon previous stage outcome Stage 1 expose participant metformin placebo four month , follow seamlessly enter Stage 2 . However , recruitment roll 15 month many recruit early enter Stage 2 even reach Stage 1 . Accordingly , protocol submission also outline Stages 2 . A successful Stage 1 lead-on clinical outcome trial ( Stages 2 3 ) , successful , fundamentally change understanding cause diabetes prevent . Stage 1 required confirm adAPT trial design achievable . Outcome evaluation undertaken 21 month . Stage 2 ( proof-of-concept ) test metformin slow-down development diabetes . The outcome data form Stage 1 allow power calculate drive number participant require study Stages 2 ( 3 ) . It propose power thus population number establish Stage 2 ( protocol ) new participant enter Stage 1 via screen follow establish trial pathway . Diabetes biological marker measure formally assessed end Stage 2 , 36 month . Stage 3 occur metformin treatment Stage 2 proven good placebo slow development diabetes . Stage 3 investigate development diabetes group , use biological marker clinical outcome five year . Children/adolescents age 5-16 year ( inclusive ) time screen sibling offspring people diagnose type 1 diabetes age 25 eligible invite participate screen phase adAPT . Families/ child invite participate screening inform study invitation letter ( via index T1D patient ) designate clinician/Principal Investigator ( PI ) via family practitioner Scottish Primary Care Research Network/Clinical Research Network ( SPCRN/CRN ) . In addition potential participant may contact study team independently ( self-referral ) response media/press internet coverage . Those invited via letter request either return reply slip , call/Short Message Service ( SMS ) /email study team register interest . Parent child age-appropriate Screening Information provide write consent assent complete . Consent/assent occur minimum 24 hour elapse study information provision . Screening take place clinically appropriate location . Screening require small non-fasting blood sample ( 3.5 ml ) . Participants offer topical anaesthesia prior blood sample take . This sample test four islet-related antibody . Two antibody infer positive test , one less conclude negative test . It anticipate approximately 5 % screen population present positive result thus 40 % risk diabetes 5 year thus eligible invited Stage 1 study . It expect 95 % people screened test negative participation conclude ( except remote data linkage relate diabetes diagnosis 10 year post study participation ) . The antibody test post study 's partner laboratory Bristol , United Kingdom ( UK ) result available within 8 week timeframe . Antibody positive participants/families receive result consultation invitation intervention stage study . Age-appropriate information sheet provide children/adolescents addition parents/guardian information . If child/adolescent parent/guardian assent/consent participant RCT phase follow visit take place : Stage 1 Month 0 ( M0 ) visit - lasting approximately 2.5 3 hour : Measure participant height , weight waist circumference . Urine pregnancy test menstruate female participant . Topical anaesthesia offer applied participant agreeable . ( Following assessment anaesthesia ) cannula insert blood sampling . Safety blood sample measure fast glucose level , full blood count , liver function , urea electrolyte . Samples send local National Health Service ( NHS ) hospital accredit laboratory . Research blood sample : Antibodies , Immunology , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA -with consent Vitamin B12 . Mixed Meal Tolerance Testing ( MMTT ) baseline sample ( Insulin , C-peptide Glucose ) follow Ensure Plus ( equivalent ) drink 6ml per kg dose ( maximum 360ml ) 4 blood test obtain 30 minute interval ( via situ cannula ) 2 hour ; Time point : 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute . Randomisation occur follow eligibility criterion safety sample result review PI . If participant eligible participant parent inform rationale non-eligibility participant ' family doctor inform clinically significant finding ( consent . ) Participants provide study medication ( Metformin placebo ) give instruction dose administration randomisation take place M0 visit . If eligible , one sibling screen , seropositive , recruit . To avoid treatment contamination , immediate family member allocate treatment group , first family member test one randomly allocate . The required study medication dose calculate use participant 's weight use dose algorithm use 2.5kg increment nearest 0.5mls . On commencement treatment metformin cause gastric intolerance , therefore minimise side effect first two week participant request take daily 10mg/kg - half target dose . Medication administered/ take orally . Month 0 + 2 week : Research nurse contact parent/participant review tolerability tolerate increase twice daily dose 10mg/kg assess adverse event profile . New write dose instruction provide . If participant tolerate dose withdrawn study . Month 1 Visit - last approximately 2.5 3 hour : Procedures M0 without antibody blood sample . Study medication increase target dose 20mg/kg , twice daily . Participants provide new write dosing instruction . Month 1 + 1 week : Research nurse phone parent/participant review tolerability up-titrated dose assess adverse event profile . If dose tolerate dose reduce previous tolerate dose 10mg/kg , twice day continue remainder trial . Where down-titration occur new write dosing instruction provide . Month 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , ( Late Stage 2 : 24 , 30 , 36 ) - last approximately 2.5 3 hour : Procedures M0 antibody sample . Clinical significant result report per local laboratory range protocol . Months 1 , 2 &amp; 3 every 3 month require research nurse contact parent/participant assess adverse event profile .</detailed_description>
