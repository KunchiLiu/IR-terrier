	<brief_summary>The main aim preliminary research determine combine self-soft tissue therapy ( SSTT ) alongside establish 6 week FMS Coping Skills Programme ( FCSP ) feasible acceptable treatment approach FMS . All participant six week FCSP randomly allocate control ( FMS Coping Skills Programme ) intervention group ( FMS Coping Skills Programme plus SSTT ) . All participant assess outcome measurement start feasibility study , six week three month completion . This feasibility study hypothesis SST approach acceptable FMS patient combine 6 week FCSP ( hand ) SSTT ( hand ) beneficial . This feasibility study inform large randomize control trial ( RCT ) combine treatment approach FMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES The main aim preliminary research : 1 . To determine feasibility conduct future large study term recruitment , randomisation , estimate effect size , study protocol procedure , intervention outcome acceptability . 2 . To determine combine SSTT ( MTrP therapy ) adjunct presently provide usual care hand ( rehabilitation self-management programme ) feasible acceptable participant combine treatment approach FMS . METHOD The multidisciplinary team include researcher health professional actively involved musculoskeletal therapy research . This current randomise controlled feasibility study support internal funding Faculty Health &amp; Applied Sciences , University West England ( UWE ) , Bristol . Ethics approval NHS ethics/IRAS obtain . Participant identification recruitment Participants identify recruited FMS patient enrol 6 week FCSP Royal National Hospital Rheumatic Diseases ( RNHRD ) out-patients department . All enrol patient FCSP , email sent invitation letter information sheet RNHRD admin clinical team request participation feasibility study . Prior primary collection data , participant sign inform consent form . Participants undergo screening ( inclusion/exclusion criterion ) , provide demographic information complete general health screen survey . Randomisation- All participant randomly allocate either control intervention group , independent researcher use block randomisation utilise online randomisation tool . This method involve create table use two number set . The randomiser ensure group appear equal number time whilst simultaneously randomly allocate participant group . The randomisation order perform co-researcher , prepare opaque envelope open relevant point process . Control Group - Participants undertake 6 FCSP . The FCSP non-pharmacological , multidisciplinary exercise education group programme . Its main aim provide condition-specific , patient centre , self-management education advice , line national driver long-term condition international FMS clinical guideline . All group participant screen prior acceptance onto FCSP must diagnosis fibromyalgia use ACR 1990 2010 criterion . Patients co-morbidities accept . Core component 6 week FCSP include goal-setting , pacing , hydrotherapy , exercise dietary advice . There one face-to-face review session three month teach component FCSP complete . Patient report outcome measure ( PROMS ) collect participant three time-points ; start course , end course three month post course . These inputted onto clinical database , analysed measure clinical progress individual basis Intervention Group - Participants group undertake 6 week FCSP plus SSTT ( myofascial trigger point ( MTrP ) therapy ) ( initially TrP pressure release perform researcher also teach SSTT home programme ) . The specific form soft tissue therapy use feasibility study MTrP therapy , use case series triceps surae dysfunction describe protocol . This protocol adapt patient FMS administer researcher two session include train teach participant SSTT . All participant control group receive advice booklet SSTT . Researcher TrP pressure release intervention- Lower leg/foot- The participant position prone knee extend TrP pressure release gastrocnemius knee flex soleus . While still prone , TrP pressure release also use medial plantar aspect foot specifically quadratus plantar abductor hallux . TrP pressure release , employ barrier release concept use . The researcher slowly apply increase thumb pressure soleus gastrocnemius MTrPs first increase tissue resistance felt ( barrier ) . Pressure initially perceive tender mildly painful , participant instruct notify researcher stop procedure tolerable . Pressure maintain release muscle tension participant feel tenderness pain related thumb pressure . On release pressure researcher apply passive stretch affect calf muscle , facilitate maintenance gain muscle length . On subsequent visit TrP pressure release progress rock facilitate ankle great dorsiflexion apply hamstring flex extend knee . Participants warn possible mild post treatment soreness ( mild ache ) may last 24 hour , interfere day day function . Forearm/Hand- Exactly TrP pressure release protocol use . All participant seat forearm rest plinth , researcher participant facing . The thenar hypothenar muscle , wrist extensor flexor muscle receive TrP pressure release stretch . Self soft tissue therapy ( SSTT ) - participant advise self treatment show technique identify active latent MTrPs low leg/foot forearm/hand . Participants show vary technique include self-massage , use tennis ball foam roller . All participant advise SSTT least day advise stop SSTT symptom increase . Stretching programme - stretching advise post SSTT MTrPs part home exercise programme . A standardised home stretch protocol issue detailed advice booklet include demonstration stretch technique advice dosage . A full description demonstration give participant . No specific time give stretch protocol evidence inconclusive duration static stretch need produce benefit . Data management analysis- Data analyse PI co-researcher office University West England . Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 20.0 use analyse data use descriptive ( mean , standard deviation range score initial follow session ) . The result additional FCSP /FMS PROMS criterion FMS diagnosis-Widespread Pain Index/Symptom Severity Score plus tenderness 18 tender point site also analyse difference group . In line aim feasibility study , inferential statistic employ . Sampling frame- As feasibility study sample size power calculation conduct . The aim recruit 20 patient , enough meet aim feasibility study sufficient provide estimate variability control intervention group . All potential participant screen accepted meet inclusion/exclusion criterion : Confidentiality/ Anonymity- Any data produce feasibility study anonymised ; therefore , identify detail replace numerically . All data analyse downloaded password protect computer University West England . Data handling Record Keeping- The CI PI responsible data collection , record quality . Anonymised collect data participant analyse downloaded password protect computer University West England . Data collect retained accordance Data Protection Act 1998 . Back-up copy electronic data make regularly onto CD . All source document retain period 5 year follow end study . Addressing Consent &amp; Withdrawal- Consent- Consent address via informed consent form give participant week data collection sign prior collection data . A full explanation opportunity ask question prior data collection afford participant . Withdrawal- Participants completely free abstain withdraw feasibility study time process data collection . Risk &amp; Risk Management- Participants invite participate feasibility study . Each participant option participate opt . Participants ' future affect way decision take part . There physical , psychological , social legal economic risk participant participate feasibility study . There additional risk researcher people impact study consequence undertake proposal great encounter normal day-to-day life . Access source data- Direct access source data document permit monitoring , audit , Research Ethics Committees review . Safety Assessments Monitoring- The project management committee consist research team ( Dr Rob Grieve , Sandi Derham Julie Russell ) , meet regularly assess study . This study monitor audited accordance UWE policy . Other Ethical Considerations- Apart already mention possible mild discomfort , participant make effort attend session SSTT home programme .</detailed_description>
