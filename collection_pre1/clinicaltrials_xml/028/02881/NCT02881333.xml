	<brief_summary>Currently , patient intellectual disability without recognizable syndrome ( case ) , way diagnosis often long , tedious expensive different approach use one identify structural variant ( duplication , deletion ) point mutation ( sequence one candidate gene ) . The development high-throughput sequence technique ( next generation sequencing : NGS ) drastically increase detection point mutation offer possibility test large number gene simultaneously . NGS also show huge potential detect structural variant . The objective research ass sensitivity simultaneous detection point mutation structural variant NGS approach . This would bring together single step equivalent perform array-Comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) analysis plus performing target sequence candidate gene . Investigators compare two approach simultaneous detection : target enrichment candidate gene cod region use probe cover region associate backbone genomic probe , approach could implement immediately diagnostic hospital , whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) , currently expensive tool routine diagnosis approach use future . Investigators compare two approach traditional one : CGH array + WGS . The implementation `` one step '' strategy detect type mutation ( punctual structural ) would accelerate improve access patient molecular diagnosis .</brief_summary>
