	<brief_summary>Excess dietary salt increase risk cardiovascular event , even people hypertensive . There evidence excess dietary salt exaggerate blood pressure sympathetic nervous system responses various perturbation increase blood pressure variability . This proposal examine effect low , medium , high salt diet cardiovascular reactivity blood pressure variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excess dietary salt cause target organ damage increase risk adverse cardiovascular ( CV ) event independent blood pressure ( BP ) . Recent data salt-resistant , normotensive rodent suggest high dietary salt enhances excitability gain sympathetic circuit , exaggerate sympathetic CV responses various stimulus , increase BP variability ( BPV ) . There limited data regard impact dietary salt intake sympathetic nerve activity ( SNA ) CV function salt-resistant human well underlie mechanism contribute adverse effect . The long-term goal determine dietary salt adversely affect BP regulation CV health . The objective proposal comprehensively evaluate impact dietary salt intake SNA CV reactivity BPV normotensive human . The investigator 2 specific aim : 1 ) Aim 1 test hypothesis high dietary salt increase SNA CV reactivity normotensive adult , 2 ) Aim 2 test hypothesis high dietary salt increase BPV normotensive adult . The expected outcome demonstrate dietary salt load increase CV reactivity BPV sympathetic nervous system mechanism originate brain . The propose research significant , study provide empirical evidence dietary salt intake impact neurohumoral control circulation salt-resistant human . The propose research innovative identify novel neurogenic action dietary salt human CV regulation .</detailed_description>
