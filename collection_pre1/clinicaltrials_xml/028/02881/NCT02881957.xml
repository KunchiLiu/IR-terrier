	<brief_summary>Vitamin D show impact prognosis variety retrospective randomized clinical trial within intensive care unit ( ICU ) environment . Despite finding , study examine impact hypovitaminosis D specialize neurocritical care unit ( NCCU ) . Given often significant difference management patient NCCU generalize intensive care unit need inquiry impact low vitamin D level specific environment . This study propose randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , single center evaluation vitamin D supplementation emergent NCCU patient population . The primary outcome involve length-of-stay emergent neurocritical care patient . Various secondary outcome , include in-hospital mortality , ICU length-of-stay , Glasgow Outcome Score discharge , complication quality-of-life metric . Patients follow 6 month post-discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D show important marker prognosis variety clinical setting , include overall mortality , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , infection/sepsis , asthma , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , pediatric/medical/surgical intensive care unit outcomes . Vitamin D play role bone maintenance , also variety extra-axial function include immune-dysregulation systemic inflammation . In addition , number randomize clinical trial support supplementation vitamin D improve outcome critical care patient . While evaluation vitamin D level remain standard-of-care institution , widespread use vitamin D monitoring impact neurocritical care patient remain limited . The investigator ' recent prospective observational study vitamin D level neurocritical patient show deficiency ( &lt; 20ng/dL ) highly associate prolonged hospital stay increase in-hospital mortality emergent patient . Moreover , number limitation arise study due observational nature . This study propose randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , single center evaluation vitamin D supplementation neurocritical care patient population . Patients admit neurocritical care unit emergent case vitamin D deficiency ( &lt; 20ng/dL ) undergo vitamin D serum draw admission randomize receive cholecalciferol/vitamin D3 supplementation ( 540,000 IU orally ) placebo . The primary outcome measure hospital length-of-stay . Secondary outcome include length ICU course , complication , medication adverse event , discharge Glasgow Outcome Score , in-hospital 30-day mortality , well quality-of-life . Power analysis estimate 198 patient need subgroup determine 2 day difference length-of-stay , study plan recruit 218 patient per treatment arm account dropout , take approximately 6-9 month recruit . Interim analysis safety monitoring perform . The investigator hypothesize vitamin D supplementation may make significant impact reduce morbidity mortality neurocritical care population . The possibility reduce hospital length stay mortality simple , safe , cost-effective intervention vitamin D supplementation may useful adjuvant treatment neurocritical care population .</detailed_description>
