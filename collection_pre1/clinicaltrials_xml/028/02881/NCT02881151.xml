	<brief_summary>This study involve treatment cognitive impairment secondary moderate severe brain injury use central thalamic deep brain stimulation . Although patient receive stimulation continuously implant pacemaker-like device , half patient device deactivate blinded assessment phase . The device reactivate follow assessment patient option continue stimulation open-label continuation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This preliminary safety study evaluate use Medtronic Activa PC+S system Medtronic Nexus-E system central thalamic deep brain stimulation ( CT-DBS ) treatment cognitive impairment secondary traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The propose study , successful , provide support evidence development novel therapeutic approach utilize CT-DBS improve endure cognitive impairment arise person multi-focal structural brain injury . This research address critical gap lack available treatment . CT-DBS target well-defined neuronal population within central thalamus know anatomical physiological specialization , provide key role arousal regulation cognitively-mediated behavior , also exhibit particular vulnerability dysfunction set multi-focal , non-selective brain injury . Our propose study aim support development CT-DBS novel therapeutic avenue access cognitive reserve patient acquire brain injury . In proposed feasibility study 6 subject single investigational site , test safety CT-DBS severe traumatic brain injury ( STBI ) population GOSE 6-7 level recovery collect data establish translation preclinical study human application CT-DBS .</detailed_description>
