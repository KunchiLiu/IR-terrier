	<brief_summary>Most immunodeficiency relate severe immunoglobulin deficiency require lifelong replacement therapy immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) reduce incidence severity infection . IgG administer intravenously ( IGIV ) every 21 28 day subcutaneously every week every week ( IGSC ) subject tolerate IV infusion difficulty venous access . No head-to-head data available directly compare HyQvia conventional SCIG . However , SCIG indicate administration frequency daily every week dose HyQvia indicate infusion frequency every 2-4 week . This study design assess IgG trough level switch standard SCIG every week HyQvia HyQvia every 3-4 week</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IgG Level Primary Immunodeficiency Switching From Standard SCIG Every Other Week HyQvia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label , one arm study conduct France subject PI IgG trough level steady state standard SCIG dose HyQvia administer every week every 3-4 week equivalent dose . The study three period : - The first period one-week ramp-up period . The first administration HyQvia one-week dose specify summary product characteristic HyQvia . - During first three-month follow-up period , HyQvia administer , every week dose equivalent dose administer previous treatment ( standard SCIG ) . - At end first follow-up period , dose HyQvia increase next infusion reach 3-week equivalent dose . If volume well tolerate , follow dose 4-week equivalent dose . HyQvia administer every 3 4 week three month .</detailed_description>
