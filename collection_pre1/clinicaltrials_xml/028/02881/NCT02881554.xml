	<brief_summary>This pilot trial study well single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) /computed tomography ( CT ) technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid work measure liver function patient liver cancer spread place body undergoing radiation therapy surgery . Diagnostic procedure , sulfur colloid SPECT/CT scan , may measure normal liver tissue , treatment help doctor plan good treatment liver cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulfur Colloid SPECT/CT Measuring Liver Function Patients With Primary Metastatic Liver Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Develop new quantitative metric baseline technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid ( SC ) uptake SPECT/CT image correlate clinical parameter liver function clinical outcome liver cancer patient receive radiation therapy ( RT ) surgery . II . Correlate post-treatment change SC uptake SPECT/CT imaging change clinical liver function . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate dose response relationship multiple spatial scale ( global liver , regional liver , liver image voxel ) radiation dose change SC uptake , acutely ( mid-RT ) subacutely ( 1 month post-RT ) , use SC SPECT/CT image . II . Estimate degree radiation response liver tissue varying level function ( i.e . compare radiation dose response well compensate liver less compensated liver ) . III . Correlate SC uptake SPECT/CT image future liver remnant ( FLR ) extent liver hypertrophy surgical resection . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 cohort depend standard care receive outside study , part cancer treatment : RT surgery . All patient total 3 SPECT/CT image 99mTc-SC . The first scan cohort routine medical care ( experimental ) take place prior initiation RT surgery . Two follow scan part protocol . COHORT A ( patient receive radiation therapy per standard cancer treatment ) : The first follow scan occurs mid-RT , second one 1 month post-RT . COHORT B ( patient undergo surgery per standard cancer treatment ) : The first follow-up scan occurs 3-5 day postoperatively , second one 1 month post-operatively . After completion study , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
