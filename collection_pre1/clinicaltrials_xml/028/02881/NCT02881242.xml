	<brief_title>Trametinib Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . To assess activity trametinib metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) progress either enzalutamide abiraterone acetate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Durability prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) response measure time PSA progression define Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 guideline PSA progression . II . Maximal PSA response . III . Quality life Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy- Prostate ( FACT-P ) . IV . Time initiation alternative antineoplastic therapy . V. Time radiographic progression . VI . Objective response rate accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline . VII . Overall survival measure time enrollment death . VIII . Safety tolerability . IX . Analysis trametinib target engagement mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related kinase ( MEK1/2 ) assess presence p-ERK , primary phosphorylation target activate MEK1/2 , pre-treatment progression radiographically direct metastatic tumor biopsy immunohistochemistry evaluation p-ERK . Markers cell proliferation ( Ki67 ) apoptosis ( p27 ) also assess . XI . Investigation molecular correlate resistance sensitivity trametinib use pre-treatment progression metastatic biopsy . XII . Discovery one set possible discriminative network associate response trametinib . XII . Enrichment patient second phase tumor exhibit genomic feature associate response trametinib . XIV . Analyses circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( ctDNA ) genomic aberration correlate treatment response . OUTLINE : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 4 week , every 4 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
