	<brief_title>EoE Food Desensitization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) clinicopathologic disorder esophagus trigger food and/or environmental allergen characterize symptom esophageal dysfunction eosinophilia esophagus . Current therapy center control inflammation steroid and/or food antigen avoidance . Such treatment option significant side effect reduce quality life , especially child . The purpose study discover way flare-provoking food reintroduce child 's diet without need medical therapy . The study would involve child age 5-17 year biopsy-proven EoE know flare-inducing food trigger . Following baseline blood work esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) , investigator initiate oral desensitization treatment child swallow spray solution contain specific food allergen extract systematically increase concentration twice daily 5 month . This desensitization phase would follow repeat blood work EGD . If child 50 % increase peak esophageal eosinophil count baseline , withdrawn study . The next phase study would involve reintroduction actual food 4 week follow repeat blood work EGD . Success would define peak eosinophil count &lt; 15 per high power field final esophageal biopsy . Oral food desensitization well-studied patient food allergy never patient pre-existing EoE . In study , adverse event include mild reaction , watery eye , rhinitis , sneeze , throat pruritus , transient erythema abdominal pain . These reaction usually require stop desensitization well control antihistamine steroid . Benefits include child less restricted diet eliminate need steroid therapy . This study yield valuable information regard management EoE , thereby improve current understanding pathogenesis .</detailed_description>
