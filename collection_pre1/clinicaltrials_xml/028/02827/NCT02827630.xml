	<detailed_description>`` Cardiometabolic disease '' define protocol refer diseases increase risk cardiovascular disease . Proteus® Digital Health operationally define cardiometabolic ( CMB ) condition study include hypertension , type 2 diabetes , hypercholesterolemia . The prevalence metabolic diseases grow . Factors contribute rise include obesity epidemic age population . In particular , cost risk complication associate diabetes hypertension , many health system payer increase focus intervention reduce burden disease . The purpose study evaluate ability new digital health offering , Proteus Discover low blood pressure glycated hemoglobin patient uncontrolled hypertension type 2 diabetes . The study enrol subject uncontrolled hypertension type 2 diabetes fail least 2 antihypertensive metformin and/or sulfonylurea . Subjects randomize one 3 arm : use Proteus Discover 4 week , use Proteus Discover 12 week , usual care . Subjects randomize intervention arm , use digital health offering ( 1 ) provide automatic passive electronic documentation medication adherence pattern medication taking , ( 2 ) assist provider distinguish inadequate medication adherence pharmacologic unresponsiveness root cause uncontrolled hypertension type 2 diabetes , ( 3 ) inform management decision ( dose adjustment , medication addition substitution , adherence counseling , referral hypertension specialist ) .
