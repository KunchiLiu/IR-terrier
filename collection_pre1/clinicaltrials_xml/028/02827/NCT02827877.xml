	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well copper Cu64-DOTA-trastuzumab positron emission tomography ( PET ) work predict response treatment trastuzumab pertuzumab surgery patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Diagnostic procedure , copper Cu 64 DOTA-trastuzumab PET , may help predict patient 's response trastuzumab pertuzumab surgery patient locally advance HER2 positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copper ( Cu ) 64-DOTA-Trastuzumab PET Imaging Predicting Response Treatment With Trastuzumab Pertuzumab Before Surgery Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate standardized uptake value maximum ( SUVmax ) patient previously untreated HER2+ breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate uptake copper 64 Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab , propose indicator responsiveness HER2-directed therapy , correlate serpin peptidase inhibitor alpha-1 antiproteinase , antitrypsin , member 1 gene ( SERPINA1 ) expression , show associated estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) / HER2+ patient survival , HER2+/ER+ patient patient . II . To compare uptake copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab patient complete pathologic response ( pCR ) vs. non-pCR patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute immediately receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab IV day 0 . Patients undergo PET scan 18-24 42-48 hour , day 1 2 . Within 3 day completion PET scan , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute weekly every 3 week pertuzumab IV 30-60 minute . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 6 course trastuzumab pertuzumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
