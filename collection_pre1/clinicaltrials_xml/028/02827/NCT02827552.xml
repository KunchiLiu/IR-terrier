	<detailed_description>900 child adolescent benefit radiation year France . The mean age diagnosis 5 year ; life expectancy 80 % could cure long , incidence radiation-related acute mainly late complication - evaluate date - could exceed adult . Dysfunction irradiate organ growth disorder specific pediatric subpopulation . Individual radiosensitivity child adolescent unknown time , probably large variability depend age consider change metabolic function throughout growth . These complication largely attributable inter individual constitutional variation cellular response DNA damage . Subject radiation-induced DNA damage double-strand break ( DSB ) , cell reacts trigger whole series phosphorylation event coordinate within multi protein complex whose interplay still misknown ( DNA damage response i.e . DDR ) . Indirect Immunofluorescence cell scan revolutionize radiation biology research permit detection individual DSB cell nucleus dose range 1 mGy 10 Gy . This technique notably confirm yield unrepaired DSB correlate cell RS . From broad spectrum human radiosensitive skin fibroblast cell line , Inserm CRU 1052 team propose general model DSB signal repair molecular assay stratify patient accord individual RS . ARPEGE biomarqueurs prospective multicenter study prospectively evaluate assay RS child adolescent treat year pediatric oncology department Region Grand Est set threshold population . 150 child thus potentially includable different center . The assay perform primary fibroblast culture skin biopsy take diagnosis . The RS patient measure blind . Confusion factor irradiate volume , skin phototype , previous chemotherapy regimen , smoking , comorbities ( diabetes , immunodeficiency , chronic inflammatory disease ... ) report . In parallel RT-acute toxicity report accord NCI-CTCAE v4.0 reference scale three month completion RT periodically 15 year . Screening hypersensitive patient would major step forward management cancer , open view personalize medicine .</detailed_description>
