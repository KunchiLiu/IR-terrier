	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect per-operative music bio-molecular inflammatory response laparoscopic surgery . Per-operative music intervention give test group via headphone control group apply headphone without music ( Silent ) . The inflammatory stress response measure postoperatively 6 hour 24 hour postoperatively along baseline level measure preoperatively . The value compare test control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Music Inflammatory Response During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery ( LS ) gain popularity amongst surgeon well patient . The appeal LS base improve patient report outcome ( PRO ) . The main PROs like post operative pain , hospital stay ability return activity well LS . The improvement PROs attribute attenuated post operative inflammatory response . The post operative inflammatory response study change various cytokine pathway . The cytokine response show subdue LS compare conventional surgery . This benefit subdue cytokine response show translate well PROs . Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) consider index LS . It also index LS evaluation potentially beneficial intervention LS . The surgical discourse last two decade achieve clinical equivalence LS conventional surgery . The clinical outcome LC stabilize . The current scientific discourse gear towards improve PROs . A multi dimensional approach include pre-operative optimisation , protocoled anaesthesia technique , 'systems approach ' base surgery standardise dissection technique recommend . Peri-operative music show improve PROs LC . A recently publish meta-analysis establish benefit peri-operative music post operative convalescence . Peri-operative music show affect neurohumoral cyto-immune expression various 'cluster differentiation ' ( CD ) marker , various cell line . Despite establish efficacy music , reluctance amongst surgeon adopt routinely . There clarity scientific curiosity type music timing music intervention , observed benefit peri-operative music . The biomolecular basis report benefit , music surgical setting study objective manner . With background investigator hypothesize per-operative music measurable bio-molecular footprint postoperative convalescence use . With hypothesis investigator wish study per-operative music effect PROs , laparoscopic cholecystectomy measurable bio-molecular or/and bio-cellular marker .</detailed_description>
