	<brief_title>A Prospective Study LessRay Enhanced Versus Standard Fluoroscopic Visualization Surgical Placement Spinal Cord Stimulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective , randomized single center study assess ability LessRay decrease overall radiation exposure surgical placement spinal stimulator . A secondary objective analyze efficacy utilize enhance low radiation image fluoroscopically intensive pain procedure . The population group 65 patient Duke University Medical Center Duke Raleigh Hospital meet medical criterion surgical placement spinal cord stimulator epidural array . They divide equally 2 arm : Research Control randomize non-surgeon study team . That information record place seal envelope . On day surgery envelope deliver OR open follow `` time-out '' . At time envelope open OR patient acknowledge evaluable failure success LessRay surgical procedure research arm . The control arm cohort proceed surgery typical without LessRay . The data two group ( Research vs. Control ) analyze use two tail t-test p &lt; .05 . The risk associate specifically implementation study respect loss confidentiality . Every effort make keep information confidential</detailed_description>
