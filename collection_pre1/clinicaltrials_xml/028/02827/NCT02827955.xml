	<brief_summary>Essential tremor ( ET ) frequent movement disorder . Its prevalence 1/200 imply least 300 000 people concerned France . Its frequency increase age ( 14 % patient 65 yo ) . The diagnostic criterion postural kinetic tremor associate head/voice tremor . ET induce social impairment also difficulties perform task require dexterity . With time , tremor severe every activity daily live impaired loss autonomy . Treatment betablockers , primidone antiepileptic might efficacy begin . But severity tremor increase , lack efficacy . Deep Brain stimulation ( DBS ) ventral intermediate nucleus ( VIM ) thalamus propose . However , case medical surgical contra-indication , Gamma Knife ( GK ) radiosurgery thalamotomy alternative option . Patients include minimum 12 month first thalamotomy ( Gamma Knife 1 ) ( do annoy side ) subject significant deterioration cognitive assessment , voice assessment balance postural assessment neuroradiological abnormality . Patients assess Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cerebral , clinical assessment ( tremor rating scale ) impairment activity daily living , neuropsychological evaluation , voice assessment balance postural assessment . The second thalamotomy ( Gamma Knife 2 ) propose monitoring M6 M12 do . This study demonstrate feasibility tolerance bilateral GK radiosurgery thalamotomy ET patient severe impairment .</brief_summary>

Man woman age 20 85 year . Patient absolute contraindication Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) VIM . Patient receive first effective unilateral thalamotomy tremor satisfactory clinical outcome ( cognitive impairment , lack postural disorder Musculoskeletal severe lack dysarthria ) . The first effective thalamotomy characterize improve score tremor ≥ 45 % improved functional gene ≥ 50 % . Patient receive first unilateral thalamotomy satisfactory radiological evolution . Unsatisfactory radiological evolution characterize contrast uptake &gt; 350 mm3 one year edema T2 Flair sequence extend beyond internal capsule . Patient require contralateral treatment severity tremor functional impairment . Patient affiliate social protection scheme .
