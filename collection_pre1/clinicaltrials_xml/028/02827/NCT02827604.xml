	<brief_title>Preoperative Intraoperative Sonographic Assessment Lower Uterine Segment Thickness Term Women With Previous Cesarean Delivery - Ultrasound Method Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1991 , 126.297 ( 15.3 % ) woman deliver caesarean section Germany . Since , rate caesarean section increase steadily next 20 year , reach 32.2 % 2011 [ http : //www.destatis.de ] . The absolute risk uterine rupture vaginal birth Caesarean section 1 100 delivery . The risk perinatal death outcome extremely neurological impairment 1 1000 delivery [ Cunningham et al. , 2009 ] . Statistically 300 pregnant woman prior caesarean delivery visit daily ultrasound department german hospital investigate C-section scar delivery . They one important question : Is possible predict successful trial labor cesarean delivery ? [ AQUA-Institut ] The information risk uterine rupture remain insufficient base ultrasonography assessment [ Varner et al. , 2012 ] . The measurement technique low uterine segment ( myometrial ) thicknesses third trimester describe several author . Using combination preoperative transvaginal transabdominal ( linear/convex probe ) ultrasound , compare intraoperative sonographic assessment low uterine segment woman underwent ≥ second cesarean section . The aim present study assess transabdominal ( linear/convex ultrasound probe ) transvaginal approach versus intraoperative sonographic assessment low uterine segment . This allow investigator draw conclusion regard best method assessment low uterine segment ( myometrial ) thickness third trimester predict successful trial labor cesarean delivery .</detailed_description>
