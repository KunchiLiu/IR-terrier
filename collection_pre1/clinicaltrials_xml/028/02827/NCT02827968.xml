	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody KN035 Treat Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose escalation follow traditional 3+3 design . Cohorts 3-6 subject enrol sequentially escalate dos 1 , 2.5 , 5 10 mg/kg weekly . Dosing schedule cohort 2 may change interim PK analysis Cohort 1 Cycle 1 bi-weekly regimen base elimination profile KN035 avoid excessive drug accumulation . Dose escalation continue identification MTD , maximum dose 10 mg/kg . MTD define high dose study 1 6 subject experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) Cycle 1 .</detailed_description>
