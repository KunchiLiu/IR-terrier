	<brief_title>Pilot Stair Climbing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Compare short-term effect two different fractionalized stair climb bout protocol glucose control among adult risk type 2 diabetes . Rationale : Fractionalized physical activity associate reduce BMI , glycated hemoglobin , low 2-hr plasma glucose insulin sensitivity cross-sectional study . Yet , study examine effect fractionalized intermittent physical activity prospective manner . Furthermore , research limit patient diagnose type 2 diabetes , use exercise moderate intensity . The hypothesis stair climb , vigorous-intensity activity , may great health effect . However , test short bout activity spread day . Implications : Fractionalized physical activity may feasible adult risk , diagnose type 2 diabetes currently active . These short bout increase energy expenditure throughout day , rather one long continuous bout currently recommend .</detailed_description>
