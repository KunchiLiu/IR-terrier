	<brief_summary>Patients undergo major spinal surgery continue experience moderate-to-severe pain first 2-3 day follow operative procedure . Several factor contribute postoperative pain patient population . Many patient present surgery dependent relatively high dos oral opioids ; daily administration lead tolerance effect drug well hyperalgesia ( exposure opioids make subsequent pain worse ) . In addition , surgical procedure spine painful . Furthermore , opioids use surgery produce analgesia ( pain relief ) 2-4 hour , lead fluctuation level pain control ( patient push button deliver pain medication begin feel discomfort ) . Recent data suggest use long-acting opioid like methadone operating room , provide analgesia 24-36 hour , may improve pain control spinal fusion surgery . However , pain treatment modality require patient population . Studies demonstrate ketamine , drug prevents pain mechanism different opioids , effective reduce pain medication requirement give perioperative period . Small-dose infusion provide analgesia , also prevent opioid tolerance hyperalgesia . In particular , combination methadone ketamine may especially effective control pain patient follow major operation . The aim randomize clinical trial examine effect low-dose perioperative infusion ketamine , give methadone operate room , postoperative pain medication requirement , pain score , clinical recovery characteristic spinal fusion surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methadone opioid potential provide prolong constant analgesia . It half-life significantly longer clinically-used opioids ( 25-52 hour ) . This unique property methadone suggest single dose administer operating room result extend pain relief follow surgery . When give intravenously surgical patient , half-life 35 hour observe , result median duration analgesia 26 hour . In patient undergoing abdominal , orthopedic , gynecologic surgery , use single dose methadone ( 20 mg 0.2-0.3 mg/kg ) induction anesthesia result reduced analgesic requirement improve pain score first 24-48 postoperative hour ( compare patient give traditional intraoperative opioids ) . Only one retrospective study examine use intraoperative methadone adult patient undergoing spinal instrumentation . In investigation , methadone use associate 50 % reduction postoperative opioid requirement , compare patient receive shorter-acting opioids . Despite use methadone postoperative PCA opioids , however , average pain score great 3 ( 0 10 scale ) methadone group . These finding suggest methadone alone insufficient alleviate pain major spine surgery . A large number clinical trial examine use ketamine perioperative period . Several systematic review meta-analyses assess benefit risk ketamine surgical patient . Bell et al . conclude perioperative ketamine reduce analgesic requirement pain intensity , . The incidence nausea vomit reduce , adverse event mild absent . Himmelseher et al . note intravenous subanesthetic ketamine general anesthesia provide pain prevention surgery . Jouguelet-Lacoste et al . determine low-dose ketamine reduce opioid consumption 40 % . Pain score also reduce , major complication note . Laskowski et al . conclude ketamine result reduction opioid consumption across study , low pain score report investigation . No significant difference adverse event note meta-analyses , exception low risk nausea vomit patient randomize receive ketamine ( high risk hallucination report one meta-analysis ) . A large number different dose strategy use ketamine . However , great efficacy appear result bolus dose give ( 0.5 mg/kg ) incision , follow intraoperative ( 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/hr ) infusion , postoperative ( 0.06-0.12 mg/kg/hr ) infusion continue least 24-48 hour Like methadone , ketamine use frequently patient undergo spinal fusion surgery due high incidence pre-existing opioid tolerance hyperalgesia ( personal communication ) . Ketamine infusion investigate 6 randomized study patient population . In 5 trial , reduce postoperative opioid requirement , decrease pain score , , observe patient randomized receive ketamine . Shorter-acting opioids use ketamine 5 investigation . Despite data suggest beneficial effect ketamine patient undergo major spine surgery , recent `` best evidence '' review state `` insufficient /or conflict evidence ketamine provide significant reduction postoperative pain narcotic usage '' In theory , use combination long-acting opioid ketamine may particularly efficacious optimize postoperative pain management . Recent evidence demonstrate methadone , like ketamine , ability block NMDA receptor . In neuropathic animal model , combination methadone ketamine produce analgesic synergy supra-additive nature . In clinical setting , administration methadone ketamine examine one small trial ( 20 patient ) . Patients randomize receive methadone ketamine require 70 % less pain medication administer methadone alone . Although clinician NorthShore institution begin use methadone ketamine patient undergoing spinal surgery , limited evidence examine approach patient population . The primary aim randomize , double-blind study examine perioperative analgesic strategy utilize ketamine methadone patient undergo posterior spinal fusion . Patients randomized ketamine group give 0.2 mg/kg methadone anesthetic induction , ketamine infusion use intraoperatively 48 hour surgery . Patients control group receive 0.2 mg/kg methadone anesthetic induction , D5W ( sugar water ) infusion intraoperatively 48 hour postoperatively . The total amount PCA hydromorphone use postoperatively record , well postoperative pain score . Recovery variable measure patient assessed adverse event potentially related opioids ketamine . NMDA receptor stimulation also think play important role development chronic pain surgery . Therefore , patient survey chronic postsurgical pain 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month operation determine whether intraoperative management may influence development long-term adverse event .</detailed_description>
