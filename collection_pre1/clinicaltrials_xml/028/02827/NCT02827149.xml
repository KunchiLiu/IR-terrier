	<brief_title>High Resolution Donor Recipient HLA Matching Level Unrelated HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) represent potentially curative treatment several haematological disorder , application depend availability suitable donor . Some data show US population likelihood find HR 8/8 HLA A , B , C , DRB1 match donor NMDP registry 75 % white Europeans 46 % white patient Middle Eastern North African descent . Moreover , probability decrease patient belong African Black South/Central American group 18 % 16 % , respectively . Furtherly , recent data report significant improvement unrelated donor identification year . In particular , conduct unrelated donor search 1344 ideal patient `` Be The Match Registry '' database 2 time point : 2009 2012 . Their result show 8/8 high resolution HLA match rate ( A , B , Cw DRB1 ) White raise 68 % 2009 72 % 2012 . Corresponding match rate 41 % 44 % Hispanic , 44 % 46 % Asian/Pacific Islander ) , 27 % 30 % African American/Black race ethnic group 2009 2012 , respectively . The 2012 10/10 match rate 67 % White , 38 % Hispanic , 41 % Asian/Pacific Islander , 23 % African American/Black . Current available data confer HLA mismatch ( 6-7/8 ) significant increase risk grade II IV III IV acute graft versus host disease , chronic graft versus host disease , transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) overall mortality compare HLA-matched case ( 8/8 ) . However , yet clear type ( allele/antigen ) locus ( HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 ) mismatch associate overall mortality . In order improve outcome unrelated HSCT , many effort ongoing identify permissive non permissive HLA disparity I II class HLA . Recently , several author highlight crucial role allelic mismatch Cw combination support GVL/ graft versus host disease effect consequent decrease risk relapse ( p &lt; 0.003 ) . On contrary , Cw disparities Cw03:03 v Cw03:04 Cw07:01 v Cw07:02 seem permissiveness term HSCT clinical outcome . Contemporarily , Japanese meta-analysis 6967 unrelated HSCT show presence HLA-B*51:01 donor/recipient pair associate acute graft versus host disease strong linkage disequilibrium HLA-C*14:02 -B*51:01 also effect HLA-B*51:01 . Based data , mismatch HLA-C*14:02 consider non-permissive HLA-C mismatch donor selection seem potent risk factor severe acute graft versus host disease mortality . Concerning DPB1 HLA locus , algorithm non-permissive HLA-DPB1 disparity describe , base T-cell alloreactivity patient , potential clinical implication . To confirm data , GITMO analysis report increase similar overall mortality non-permissive HLADPB1 disparity 10 10 ( HR 2.12 ; CI , 1.23-3.64 ; P .006 ) 9 10 allele-matched transplantation ( HR 2.21 ; CI , 1.28-3.80 ; P .004 ) , early-stage advanced-stage disease . Additionally , recent data report among 8/8 matched case , HLA-DPB1 -DQB1 mismatch result increased acute graft versus host disease HLA-DPB1 mismatch associate decreased relapse . Non-permissive HLA-DPB1 allele mismatch also associate high TRM compare permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch HLA-DPB1 match increase overall mortality compare permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch 8/8 ( 10/10 ) match case . Based report , current suggestion concern unrelated donor selection consist full match HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 unrelated donor optimal HSCT survival , avoid non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch otherwise HLA-matched pair . In 2009 , previous retrospective Italian analysis , perform 805 couple , report globally difference term outcome ( Overall Survival , Disease Free Survival , Relapse Rate Transplant Related Mortality Graft Versus Host Disease ) adult patient neoplastic disease transplant HLA-matched donor 10/10 9/10 . However , stratify patient stage disease transplant , single HLA incompatibility significantly increase risk mortality patient receive HSCT early stage whereas data confirm patient transplant advanced stage disease . This previous Italian analysis include 10/10 high-resolution type pair 1999 2006 , exclude others couple without full HLA type avoid confound result . According Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry standard , extend HR HLA mandatory requirement 1999 2006 . From January 2012 , Italian recipient type HR-HLA type start unrelated donor search process consequent advantage term `` non select population '' object present observational trial . Moreover , large size cohort patient underwent unrelated HSCT small study period 2 year lead effective analysis include assessment permissive non-permissive I II class HLA incompatibility . Finally , order give strong statistical power trial , particular effort draw order recovery data graft versus host disease prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
