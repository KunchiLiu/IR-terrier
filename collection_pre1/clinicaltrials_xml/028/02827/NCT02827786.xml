	<brief_title>Feasibility Electromagnetic Acoustic Imaging Liver Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Population Single centre pilot study enrol 30 patient . The study population comprise adult patient document characterized focal liver lesion ( ) ( malignant and/or benign ) base image perform Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre . Target lesion background liver study include : 1 . Malignant tumour ( metastasis ( adenocarcinomas neuroendocrine tumour ) primary hepatic malignancy ) 2 . Benign tumour ( haemangioma , focal nodular hyperplasia adenoma ) 3 . Background liver ( remote target lesion ) , normal fatty liver parenchyma include . Participants must meet strict inclusion/exclusion criterion study participation . Enrollment 1 . Patients refer medical image Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre image finding consistent focal hepatic lesion ( ) conventional US , CECT and/or MRI , characteristic specific hepatic tumour ( benign malignant ) , great 1.5cm size locate within portion liver readily amenable US assessment . An abdominal radiologist and/or surgical oncologist identify patient . Recruitment occur prior baseline imaging ( time image requisition receipt ) immediately follow baseline imaging , either study coordinator surgical oncologist . 2 . Patients refer imaged guide percutaneous biopsy focal liver lesion also identify recruit advance biopsy appointment/intervention , either study coordinator refer surgical oncologist ( time receive request biopsy respectively ) . 3 . In case responsible physician patient inform intent participant , advance EMA imaging , thus ensure recruitment occurs within circle care . Imaging All EMA imaging perform use investigational EMA device/system , locate within Department Medical Imaging , Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre . Informed consent obtain time study enrollment , re-confirmed time EMA study . Pre-determined target liver lesion ( ) ( base baseline diagnostic CT , US MRI ) review experienced board certify radiologist . Target lesion initially evaluate conventional b-mode US image identify lesion location , size morphology . Technical feasibility EMA imaging evaluate ( image window , adequate breath hold etc ) . Target lesion image two plane ( sagittal transverse ) b-mode , two target lesion assess per patient . One focal site background liver parenchyma also assess , remote target lesion . Grey-scale tissue characteristic record target background parenchyma , include target size , location , morphology lesion assign conspicuity score operator . EMA image perform use dedicate experimental EMA system . Imaging pre-determined target lesion ( ) background liver parenchyma acquire ( see detail EMA image technique ) , single plane pre-set region interest . Qualitative quantitative parameter recorded/stored image system . No oral intravenous contrast agent use EMA study . Standard modify ultrasound coupling gel use routinely per standard clinical practice . Integration Standard Treatment Liver Cancer Conventional US together EMA image additional test/intervention perform part study routinely do study population . Patients receive standard work-up , treatment follow-up liver lesion ( ) accord clinical guideline institutional policy . Management and/or treatment modify base result study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnostic liver imaging ( US , CT MRI ) prior enrolment demonstrate characteristic ( benign malignant ) focal liver lesion classic imaging feature focal liver lesion undergo histopathological analysis ( percutaneous biopsy surgical resection ) follow EMA image . 2 . Focal liver lesion â‰¥ 1.5cm 3 . Predetermined focal liver lesion location likely easily visible US 4 . Ability provide write informed consent participate study 1 . Pregnant possibility pregnancy 2 . Cardiac pacemaker implant cardioverter defibrillator , neurostimulation system , hepatobiliary metallic foreign body tattoo propose site image . 3 . Indeterminate focal liver lesion conventional US , CT and/or MRI image without prospect histopathological assessment lesion ( ) 4 . Local and/or systemic treatment related focal liver lesion , prior EMA imaging . 5 . Inability obtain imaging and/or acceptable quality greyscale and/or EMA imaging</criteria>
