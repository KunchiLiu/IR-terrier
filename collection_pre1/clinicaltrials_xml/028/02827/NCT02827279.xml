	<brief_title>Study Visual Perception During Emotional States Subjects With Intrusive Disorder Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : The Pervasive Developmental Disorders ( PDD ) severe neurodevelopmental disorder , affect nearly 1 % general population . The disorder social interaction often describe result poor emotion recognition , bad perception biological motion . However , result study issue divergent . The PDD also describe disorder emotion regulation , study address emotional feeling individual ASD neuropsychological implication . Many study analyze effect emotion induce - felt - healthy subject . The effect emotion cognitive attentional process often call `` emotional effect interference . '' As already demonstrate , emotion ( eg induce music film ) result change visual perception environment strategy . These non-conscious mechanism promote interactive synchrony surround world , especially social interaction . We assume alteration perceptual-emotional regulation process PDD contribute disorder social interaction . In absence sufficient data literature , wish establish exploratory study use Eye-tracking , objectify link emotional perceptual processing PDD . Objectives : The main objective study effect induce emotion child ASD visual exploration strategy . We assume direction gaze photographs different emotional valence individual ASD change emotional state locate . We compare population child PDD control population match age , sex . Our secondary goal study link 1 ) socio adaptive level ( measure Vineland 2 ) intensity autistic symptom ( score ADI ) gaze orientation towards social subject visual stimulus . Methods : This comparative exploratory pilot study . We 'll look use eye-tracking , policy term look group child ASD , context emotional induction ( joy , fear , sadness anger ) use sound stimulus . Conclusion : This study would better characterize emotional processing ASD generate hypothesis could test neurophysiological study . Moreover , contribute development new support technique .</detailed_description>
