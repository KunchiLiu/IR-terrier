	<brief_title>Assessing Stability Uterine Scar Tissue Women With Previous History Caesarean Section Using Multimodal Analyses Lower Uterine Segment Including Quantitative Sonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1991 , 126.297 ( 15.3 % ) woman deliver caesarean section Germany . Since , rate caesarean section increase steadily next 20 year , reach 32.2 % 2011 . The absolute risk uterine rupture vaginal birth Caesarean section 1 100 delivery . The risk perinatal death outcome extremely neurological impairment 1 1000 delivery . Statistically 300 pregnant woman prior caesarean delivery visit daily ultrasound department german hospital investigate C-section scar delivery . They one important question : Is possible predict successful trial labor cesarean delivery ? The information risk uterine rupture remain insufficient base ultrasonography assessment . What possibilities additional parameter examine stability uterine scar tissue ? Currently , define cut-off value scar thickness prediction uterine rupture . It remain questionable whether thickness low uterine segment determinant factor stability scar probability rupture . However , another important factor functional elasticity structure connective tissue . It investigate ( quantitatively qualitatively ) . Objective project : Multimodalities assessment , include ultrasonography elastography , validate accuracy uterine scar stability woman previous history Caesarean section vitro vivo .</detailed_description>
