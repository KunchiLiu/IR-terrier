	<brief_title>Durvalumab Before Surgery Treating Patients With Oral Cavity Oropharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate effect durvalumab local systemic immune activation HPV status patient oral cavity oropharynx head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . II . To examine effect durvalumab systemic immune response HPV tumor associate antigen . III . To examine effect durvalumab immune regulatory mechanism . IV . To explore association level immune-regulatory micro-ribonucleic acid ( miR ) plasma saliva immune response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Investigate effect treatment durvalumab compute tomography ( CT ) scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan response . II . Evaluate safety short induction treatment durvalumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive durvalumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 3-17 day last dose administration durvalumab , patient undergo surgery . Patients may receive additional dose durvalumab time surgery longer 30 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 90 day .</detailed_description>
