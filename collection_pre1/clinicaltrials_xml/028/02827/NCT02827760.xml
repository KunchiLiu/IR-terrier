	<brief_summary>The composition metabolism human gut microbiota play crucial role health . Microbial colonisation gastrointestinal tract varies widely , large intestine high density microbe term bacterial cell per gram also metabolically active microbial community . Genetics , mode birth , infant feeding pattern , antibiotic usage , sanitary living condition long term dietary habit contribute towards shape composition gut microbiome . Diet clearly major impact variation gut microbiota composition , detect faecal sample day . The bacterial metabolism dietary component produce much chemical diversity large intestine protective detrimental effect disease development . Dietary protein level relatively high western European population , 103g/d , report Food Agriculture Organization . This may result high level , enter large gut become substrate proteolytic bacteria . Protein specifically provide nutrition microorganism metabolites bacterial protein breakdown detrimental . Protein intake diet might source microbial proteolysis ; human body also secrete considerable amount protein digestive lumen potentially use microflora . On contrary , end product carbohydrate metabolism positive health . In context , prebiotics carbohydrate resistant digestion become available bacteria colon produce short chain fatty acid inhibit production harmful metabolite . A switch towards carbohydrate metabolism colon , expense proteolysis therefore positive capacity production benign metabolite . Rationale design Prebiotics dietary ingredient target carbohydrate digesting bacteria . Given high intake level protein Western population , may useful modulate composition/activity microbial gut ecology improve health . Among prebiotic nutrient , inulin-type fructans ( ITF ) well characterize administration promote growth beneficial microorganism like Bifidobacterium spp . .These microorganism involve reduction intestinal endotoxin concentration , improve glucose tolerance , exert benefit upon immune function inhibit pathogen . In healthy individual , ITF intake promotes satiety modulates gut peptide regulate food intake . The aim present study investigate effect inulin-type fructans ( ITF ) negative consequence colonic fermentation individual consume high protein diet . The hypothesis test action promotes carbohydrate degrade bacteria expense protein utiliser .</brief_summary>
