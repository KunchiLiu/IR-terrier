	<brief_summary>The general aim project identification dynamic molecular marker help early real time prediction sustain benefit benefit ibrutinib treatment CLL harbor TP53 mutation . Specific aim project include : 1 ) Assess whether clearance TP53 mutate clone translates predictive biomarker long term benefit ibrutinib treatment CLL . 2 ) Assess whether plasma cell free DNA represent sensitive tool early dynamically inform development ibrutinib resistant mutation CLL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Biomarkers That Are Predictive Early Ibrutinib Treatment Failure High Risk TP53 Mutated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In chemoimmunotherapy era , TP53 mutation define subgroup high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient allogeneic stem cell transplantation strongly consider . As result accumulate favorable outcome data report new biological drug , include ibrutinib , high risk CLL harbor TP53 mutation , concern whether patient continue offer allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Despite improved outcome , proportion high risk CLL harbor TP53 mutation go develop ibrutinib resistance , turn translate poor survival . On base , set ibrutinib treatment , novel biomarkers require re-define high risk CLL patient candidate consolidation strategy include allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Our work hypothesis : ) clearance high risk TP53 mutate clone upon treatment ibrutinib may associate long progression free survival ( PFS ) , conversely , persistence increase high risk TP53 mutate subclones ibrutinib may associate acquisition resistance disease progression ; ii ) plasma cell free DNA represent accessible source tumor DNA early sensitive identification mutation cause resistance ibrutinib . By use highly sensitive ultra-deep next generation sequence strategy monitor molecular biomarkers potentially relevant ibrutinib DNA come cellular plasma fraction peripheral blood , project chance identify new dynamic molecular marker help early real time prediction sustain benefit ibrutinib treatment vs imminent progression TP53 mutate CLL patient . In end , result study provide base refine current approach treatment tailor TP53 mutate patient allow identification case , though clinical response ibrutinib , conceivably benefit immediate switch alternative option ( i.e . novel drug , allogeneic stem cell transplantation , CART ) .</detailed_description>
