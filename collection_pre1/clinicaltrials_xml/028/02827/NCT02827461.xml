	<detailed_description>Excessive daytime sleepiness prevalent problem society associate increase risk vehicular crash industrial accident . Sleepiness , part , determine fundamental biology relate sleep homeostasis , i.e. , rate accumulation pressure sleep wakefulness . A differential susceptibility sleep deprivation report normal subject large intraindividual difference degree functional impairment produce duration sleep . Genetics likely play important role sleep homeostasis show recent study inbred mouse strain , whether genetics play role human , , magnitude role , unknown . This proposal base hypothesis sleep homeostasis heritable trait human . Given complexity phenotyping study sleep homeostasis , investigator propose study difference variance phenotype monozygotic dizygotic twin optimal approach estimate heritability sleep homeostasis . The investigator assess sleep homeostasis 80 pair monozygotic 80 pair dizygotic twin quantify increase delta power recovery sleep follow sleep deprivation increase theta power period prolong wakefulness . Subjects recruit use PennTwins Cohort , population-based cohort 1,800 twin pair . If heritability sleep homeostasis show , EEG-based phenotyping strategy could easily apply large scale population study require assess underlying genetic variant . Thus , part overall strategy evaluate , potentially validate , approach phenotyping less physiologically rigorous easily apply large number subject . Therefore , subsidiary goal , investigator also estimate heritability performance lapse prolong wakefulness surrogate method assess sleep homeostasis . The investigator particularly determine whether difference measure base physiological intensive phenotype pair dizygotic twin reflect difference phenotyping approach simpler perform . Such result would indicate simpler method could use large scale population study , part future strategy elucidate genetic variant determine sleepiness .</detailed_description>

The exclusion criterion include follow : Previous diagnosis sleep disorder , e.g. , narcolepsy , obstructive sleep apnea ; presence condition could interrupt sleep , e.g. , chronic pain , asthma , arthritis ; presence fibromyalgia ; previous clinical diagnosis major depression ; history alcoholism drug abuse ; medical disorder limit ability participate protocol ; Use sedative/hypnotics promote sleep ; use stimulant , e.g. , methylphenidate ; use modafinil ; excessive use caffeine ( &gt; 500 mg/day ) ; use psychoactive medication , e.g. , antidepressant ; Shiftwork ; regular travel across time zone , particular 6 week prior study enrollment ; irregular sleep/wake pattern . ( This assess prior indepth phenotyping measurement rest/activity home ( see ) ; Inability comprehend English ( questionnaire consent form English ) , The study exclude woman pregnant perimenopausal include woman postmenopausal without hot flash , premenopausal .</criteria>
