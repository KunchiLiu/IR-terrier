	<brief_summary>Thoracolumbar ( TL ) burst fracture neurologically intact patient account approximately 45 % TL spine injury . Despite common fracture , significant variability treatment recommendation encompass surgery non-surgical treatment option . The controversy regard optimal treatment injury fuel several study suggest potential benefit surgical treatment realm patient satisfaction , overall socio-economic burden treatment study demonstrate improve outcome low morbidity non-surgical treatment . This study aim perform prospective cohort analysis investigate clinical outcome various treatment alternative patient A3/A4 fracture thoracolumbar region . A cost-effectiveness analysis also perform identify cost benefit treatment option . More specifically sub-group analysis perform group patient , equipoise regard patient treatment , decide blind review panel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>208 subject ( i.e. , 137 per surgical group ; 71 per conservative group ) TL burst fracture AOSpine classification type A3 A4 without neurological deficit define inclusion/exclusion criterion , without suspect Posterior Ligament Complex ( PLC ) injury ( M1 ) T10 L2 , enrol prospective multicenter cohort study . Patients may associate B injury , must A3 A4 . Patients monitor prospectively patient report , clinical radiologic outcome , period 2 year post-treatment . Specifically patient diary measure Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , employment information ( indirect cost questionnaire ) every second week 6 month post-treatment . Diary continue every second month 2 year post-treatment . All interventions/examinations consider standard care .</detailed_description>

Absence neurological deficit determine International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury ( ISNC SCI ) . It document status `` E '' ( neurologically intact/normal ) patient . Spontaneous fracture due pathologic process neoplasia Head injury cause inability cooperate hospital admission Open penetrate spinal lesion ( e.g . due gun , stab , projectile ) Prior spinal surgery thoracic lumbar spine Additional musculoskeletal , head injury would preclude rapid mobilization Multiple trauma Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) &gt; 16 Other comorbidities preclude patient consider surgical nonsurgical candidate , i.e . burn , dementia , BMI &gt; 40 , etc . Any severe systemic medical disease would exclude patient potential candidate surgery Prisoner Participation medical device medicinal product study within previous month could influence result present study Recent history substance abuse ( i.e. , recreational drug , alcohol ) would preclude reliable assessment .
