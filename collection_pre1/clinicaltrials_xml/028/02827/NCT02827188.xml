	<brief_summary>The objective Cognitive Restructuring ADHD : Functional Training ( CRAFT ) study develop non-pharmacological intervention program child Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . ADHD childhood onset clinical disorder inattention , hyperactivity , impulsivity . The present study investigate validity , feasibility efficacy novel intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist pre-post design include three phase . Participants test individually SickKids baseline post-training , train phase take place participant ' respective home . Each participant 's parent complete demographic/medical questionnaire . The cognitive behavioural outcome measure interest study follow : Planning Organization : Tower Test Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ; Delis et al , 2001 ) test planning problem solve ability . Participants ask construct tower discs set peg correspond model . Raw score reflect participant 's ability use few possible move achieve tower depict model . Response Inhibition : Inhibitory control measure use Stop Signal Task ( SST ) . The SST measure ability cancel already initiate motor response . The primary outcome measure participant ' mean stop signal reaction time ( SSRT ) . Inattentive Hyperactivity Behaviour : Items associate inattentiveness hyperactivity Swanson , Nolan Pelham Teacher Parent Rating Scale version 4 ( SNAP IV ) use estimate behavioural symptom associate ADHD . Academic Performance : Academic efficiency accuracy assess use fluency measure Woodcock Johnson III ( WJ III ) test achievement . Spatial Span : The spatial span item Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children ( WISC ) use estimate child 's visuo-spatial span . The primary outcome measure number correctly recall spatial location . Working Memory : Working Memory test use Spatial N-back 0,1,2 . Phase 1 : Baseline Session Children parent participate 2 hour clinic session SickKids . During appointment , investigator/research staff ass child 's cognitive performance . The cognitive measure select base range process commonly impaired child ADHD also target Mega Team . Both train group control group complete assessment battery . Tasks questionnaires include battery ; - Spatial Span ( work memory ) - WJ III - Tower Test ( D-KEFS ) - SST - SNAP - Demographic/Medical questionnaire - Spatial N-back 0,1,2 Spatial Working Memory show impaired ADHD . In task , experimenter point sequence spatial location grid child require reproduce sequence forward backward order . The length sequence vary set 2-7 . The spatial span task score base Spatial Span score rule norm ( WISC-IV Integrated ) . Academic efficiency accuracy assess use fluency measure Woodcock Johnson III ( WJ III ) test achievement . Participants complete reading fluency , math fluency write fluency subtests use alternate form A B assessment period prevent retesting bias . This battery select include study provide objective measure academic performance area child ADHD often show weakness ( Czamara et al. , 2013 , Greven et al.,2013 , Schmiedeler Schneider , 2013 ) . Tower Test ( DKEFS subtest ( Delis et al. , 2001 ) test planning problem solve ability . Planning organizational deficit report child ADHD ( Grodzinsky Diamond , 1992 , Mataro et al. , 1997 , Wilcutt et al. , 2005 ) target Mega Team . Participants ask construct tower discs set peg correspond model . Raw score reflect participant 's ability use few possible move achieve tower depict model . The Stop Signal Test ( SST ) measure response inhibition . Difficulties response inhibition ADHD report 82 % study examine . Response inhibition posit endophenotype ADHD show distinguish group child ADHD one ADHD symptoms one conduct disorder . In SST , participant perform choice reaction time task instruct respond quickly accurately possible . On portion trial ( e.g . 25 % ) stop signal ( tone ) present participant require restrain motor response . The delay go stimulus ( primary task ) onset stop signal varies determine participant 's ability stop already initiated motor response . This individualized stopping latency varies function impulsivity . The stop-signal reaction time ( SSRT ) provide measure ability inhibit already initiate response . The SNAP-IV parent 18-item Rating Scale standardize scale measure symptom associate ADHD . This provide opportunity identify child 's behavioural issue relative standardized norm . This measure include Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSM-IV ) criterion ADHD item 1-9 represent inattentive subset symptom item 10-18 represent Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subset . Parents request fill scale baseline , train post-training . Spatial N-back 0,1,2 - The N-Back task require on-line monitoring , update , manipulation remember information measure key process within work memory . In N-Back task , participant require monitor series stimuli respond whenever stimulus present one present n trial previously , n pre-specified integer , usually 0 , 1 , 2 . The current study use spatial location ( spatial ) paradigm . Phase 2 : Training Sessions In phase , child treatment group train home computer internet connection . They instruct practice Mega Team 30-35 minute day , approximately 5 day week minimum 21 session maximum 25 session . The minimum value 21 session select base finding prior research . Majority study able capture significant training-induced improvement 21 session . The maximum training session 25 day set control variability within group . Performance Mega Team automatically upload secure website monitor experimenter compliance data analyse purpose . For example , research staff know often long participant train Mega Team . One major objective study design train program inherently engage child easier comply train schedule . It possible presence certain comorbid condition ODD affect adherence . However , goal avoid compliance issue ensure Mega Team game-like interest child . Children control group play video-games usual . Participants ' parent/guardian group ( Treatment , Control ) ask complete video game usage log weekly record type duration video game playing . Parents group also require fill SNAP-IV parent 18-item questionnaire week training phase . This questionnaire provide measure change behaviour . Phase 3 : Post-Training Session Following completion training , family treatment control group schedule another 2 hour clinic session . The time completion train post-training appointment range 2-7 day . At appointment , family ask complete task questionnaire administer baseline session . In session , child also ask fill Video-game Questionnaire . At end post-training visit participant control group send home access Mega Team game duration treatment group .</detailed_description>
