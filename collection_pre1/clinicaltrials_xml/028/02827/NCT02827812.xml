	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) chronic neurodegenerative disease due loss dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra , lead motor symptom tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia , well array non-motor symptom affect cognition , sleep , behaviour , autonomic nervous system . Lifelong rehabilitation measure , along medication treatment , major component patient management . Physical exercise positively affect patient ' quality life ( QOL ) functional capacity . Poor adherence rehabilitation , limited patient education , access specialize care barrier treatment . A number paper fact report telemedicine acceptable mean care delivery reduces travel burden may improve patient outcome . However , study randomize control include nursing home patient , may benefit specialty care . Moreover , evidence support use telerehabilitation physical assessment people PD . For reason investigator hypothesize home telerehabilitation system guide patient follow exercise program combine computerized decision-support tool monitoring patient performance , would feasible acceptable patient PD would improve functional status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim study : 1 . Demonstrate feasibility home telesurveillance rehabilitation program 2 . Demonstrate effectiveness program improving quality life functional aspect patient affect Parkinson 's disease 30 patient affect Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , consecutively screen . The method sequence generation rely computerized random number generator . The person allocate patient two group involve either treatment evaluation patient . The study submit approval Central Ethics Review Board . Participants randomly assign two different group train use random number table receive either telemedicine care ( PTE ) usual care ( PUC ) . All patient receive Institute comprehensive baseline evaluation conduct neurologist physical therapist specialize treatment PD . During baseline evaluation ( T0 ) , PTE PUC perform two supervised familiarization session use train protocol use home . Caregivers essential part PD patient ' home management rehabilitation therefore involve educational stage . Each patient group receive two type physical intervention : 1 . A traditional custom-tailored rehabilitative exercise program ; trained therapist perform exercise . These exercise include functional strengthening , stretch , postural change balance activity 2 . An aerobic training All patient ask perform exercise 60 minute 3 days/week three month . The training phase last 20 minute first month 30 minute second third month ; Training intensity could progressively increase three month intervention , Aerobic train familiarization session perform ergometer receive home-based training .</detailed_description>
