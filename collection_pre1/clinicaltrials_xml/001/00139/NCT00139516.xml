	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Studies smoke cessation intervention among hospitalized patient CVD pulmonary disease produce varying cessation rate , range 20 51 % among patient pulmonary disease , 22 71 % among survivor coronary disease much 80 % among lung cancer patient ( 3-8 ) . Recently publish Treating Tobacco Use Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline ( 1 ) provide detailed evaluation synthesis evidence-based component effective smoke cessation intervention summary result select treatment modality present Table 1 . Face-to-face counsel , strong advice physician nurse , number reinforce session duration session related success ( 9 ) . Compared treatment , estimate abstinence rate treatment modality range 10.2 % 26.5 % . Thus , use combination treatment modality smoke cessation intervention expect result high abstinence rate . The propose four-year prospective , randomized clinical trial 12 month follow-up , test efficacy culturally linguistically tailored physician direct , nurse manage , smoke cessation relapse prevention intervention among Chinese smoker . The study two aim : 1 ) To test efficacy intervention among smoker ; 2 ) To examine set measure ( background , general health , psychosocial , smoke process ) associate smoke cessation 6 12 month . Subjects smoke 3 month prior admission 6 San Francisco Bay Area hospital ( 1 university , 4 private 1 county ) screen , recruit randomized one two intervention : ) Intensive [ n=190 ] ( physician advice , bedside counsel family member , 5 telephone contact within 90 day , nicotine replacement therapy one repeat relapse counsel 1 telephone contact relapsers ) . b ) Minimal [ n=190 ] ( physician advice self-help manual ) . Random assignment stratify recruitment site , gender disease category . Primary outcome include biochemically confirm abstinence quit attempt 6 12 month . Power calculation base 15 % difference abstinence rate two intervention group . The finding propose study yield significant knowledge effectively treat Chinese smoker provide insight treatment smoker racial ethnic minority likely significant public health impact reduce health disparity among US sub-populations . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A prospective , randomized clinical trial 12-month follow-up linguistically tailor , nurse-managed smoking cessation relapse prevention trial . It involve several stage study : Stage 1 : Recruitment - verify eligibility criterion make phone appointment face-to-face baseline interview individualize counseling session . Stage 2 : Baseline face-to-face interview either hospital setting inpatient , office setting inpatient - explain study , obtain informed consent , conduct baseline survey randomize patient one two research arm : Intensive minimal . Intensive patient receive specific set intervention ask contract quit date , whereas minimal subject receive usual care advice quit research staff physicians . Stage 3 : For subject randomize intensive group , receive set intervention support phone call quit-smoking effort . Stage 4 : Outcome Measurement - All subject receive 6- 12-month phone call saliva sample collect verify non-smoking status . At six month - interim outcome , 12 month - final outcome measurement . Procedures Cognitive Pretest : We conduct pretest translate material use individual interview ascertain face validity . Participants cognitive pretest either bilingual fluent either English Chinese . These participant include current recent ex-smokers community speak either Mandarin Cantonese ( two commonly speak Chinese dialect ) . Intervention : Participants assign minimal intervention group receive physician advice standard self-help manual , either English version `` Freedom From Smoking '' American Lung Association ( ALA ) , Chinese version `` Victory Smoking , '' ( see attach ) . The physician advice consist strong message urge patient quit smoking ( see attach ) . Physicians prompt deliver 1- 2-minute unequivocal script message necessity quit smoking . For inpatient , 1-page prototype Physician Advice Statement place progress note section patient 's medical record serve physician reminder . For outpatient , first counsel session do outside physician 's office setting , 1-page prototype fax physician 's office notify physician remind counsel study subject . If counsel do physician 's office , 1-page prototype give directly patient physician place inside office chart absence . Participants intensive group receive nurse- health educator-managed smoking cessation relapse prevention intervention . The intensive intervention two period : initial counseling session follow-up phone support . Initial Counseling Session - Patients intensive group receive script physician advice well endorsement physician nurse/health educator-managed smoking cessation intervention . A nurse/health educator-mediated behavioral counseling provide obtain baseline smoke history determine self-efficacy smoking cessation . The 60- 90-minute nurse/patient educator-managed intervention include component patient education , skill build relapse prevention counseling . During session , patient give individually-tailored counseling base his/her baseline assessment information . They also give 20-minute smoking cessation video Chinese , Chinese workbook Victory Smoking self-help manual , base Freedom From Smoking workbook American Lung Association , 15-minute relaxation audiotape Chinese . Although primary focus intervention cognitive behavioral intervention , nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) offer patient medical contraindication NRT : ) meet criterion nicotine dependency ; b ) note nurse severe withdrawal symptom ( inpatient ) self-report severe withdrawal symptom previous quit attempt , ; c ) relapse initial counseling ; ) smoke 10 cigarette day . For patient either group smoking within 7 day prior time interview , 2-3 cc saliva collect study metabolic rate cotinine . Patients offer NRT train nurse/health educator , form gum ( Nicorette 2 4 mg ) patch ( Nicoderm 14 21 mg ) , depend patient ' preference . We obtain approval subject 's physician providing NRT . Upon physician consent , patient instruct correct use nicotine patch gum nurses/health educator use 8-week protocol nicotine patch gum ) [ see NRT protocol ] . Post-Counseling Period ( 2 90 day ) - During period , nurses/health educator contact patient intensive group begin 48 hour post discharge inpatient , 48 hour post patient ' quit date outpatient . Additional call make 7- , 21- , 45- 90-day interval period great risk relapse ( 9 ) . Reinforcements proper nutrition , physical activity enlist support family member friend provide 10-minutes telephone follow-up contact . If subject relapse first 90-day period enrollment ( identify schedule telephone call nurses/ health educator ) , offer one additional intervention telephone call . The purpose call review smoke cessation material originally present subject , continue problem solve subject regard high-risk situation lead relapse , reinforce importance quit smoke permanently . The primary focus intervention cognitive behavioral intervention . Nicotine replacement therapy one component intensive intervention . Because NRT consider standard care , propose withhold NRT rather offer medication part minimal intervention . Regardless intervention arm , participant able take NRT either prescribed clinician . The nurse/health educator record use NRT among participant treat NRT . Intervention Follow-up Assessments : After intervention , subject reassess script telephone interview 6 12 month ( see attach ) . Each telephone call take approximately 10 minute . Nurses/health educator blind group assignment make follow-up call . Initial question ass smoke status categorize subject one three category : nonsmoker ( smoke since initial counseling session last telephone call ) , relapser ( smoke since initial counseling session last telephone call continuous basis ) , continuous smoker ( smoked daily past 7 day ) . After assessment , saliva sample collection kit mail non-smoking participant instruction postage-paid envelope return . Participants return cotinine within 15 day contact telephone .</detailed_description>
