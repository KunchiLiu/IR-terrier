	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Home health care non-institutional , `` diverse health care set '' provide service high-risk population characterize multiple chronic condition significant need medical self-care management . Home health agency discharge approximately 7.6 million patient 1998 , approximately 60 65 % female 12 15 % black ( US DHHS 2000 ; Haupt 1998 ) . Home health patient clinically diverse . Individuals condition circulatory system comprise single large share ( 22 % 1996 ) ( Haupt 1998 ) , heart failure ( I-IF ) , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , essential hypertension ( HTN ) patient ' frequent primary diagnosis ( Haupt &amp; Jones 1999 ) . Most home health patient enter care hospitalization two-thirds discharge community . Management HTN high priority guideline adoption quality improvement activity home health care ( Peterson 2004 ) , even though approximately 8 % home care patient admit essential HTN first , second , third diagnosis ( Haupt &amp; Jones , 1999 ) . In word one clinical nurse specialist , home health nurse tend see elevate BP reading `` set number rather condition manage , '' despite fact patient may high risk future HTN-related complication virtue comorbidities history prior hospitalization . Teaching patient condition , promote patient self-management , help patient adhere medical regimen establish physician , link community resource central role home health nurse ( Clemen-Stone et al . 2002 ) . However , advent home health prospective payment system , nurse work heighten pressure constrain service use reduce time patient 's home . This pressure , turn , may provide disincentive focus high BP management issue , particularly HTN second third diagnosis primary reason person admit home care . Thus home health care represent segment health care system significant number high-risk HTN patient serve , HTN practice likely require significant improvement , nursing personnel uniquely position mobilize care management patient education skill increase proportion treated HTN patient achieve adequate BP control . The underlying premise project organizational change improve BP management outcome easily occur home health care without new intervention model , rigorous evaluation impact , effort opinion leader clinical research community disseminate information strategy efficacious cost-effective . Visiting Nurse Service New York ( VNSNY ) , serve 70,000 adult patient per year , provide prominent organizational `` laboratory '' test promise new model care . The study response Request Applications release September 2003 `` Interventions Improve Hypertension Control Rates African Americans . '' DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study enroll African American patient uncontrolled hypertension enter home care program VNSNY . It employ randomized design , whereby VNSNY nurse provide direct care eligible study population ( estimate 300 nurse serve estimated 1000 African American patient uncontrolled hypertension ) randomly assign control group one two intervention group upon identification first eligible hypertensive patient provide care study period . Throughout study , nurse continue administer intervention , either usual care , basic intervention , augment intervention , randomization nurse , rather patient . A nurse 's initial random assignment specific group ( usual care , basic treatment , augment treatment ) determine status new patient allocate particular nurse 's care duration study . The two intervention test include follow : 1 ) `` basic '' intervention deliver key evidence-based information nurse , physician , patient patient receive traditional post-acute home health care ; 2 ) `` augment '' intervention transition patient Home-Based HTN Support Program extend information , monitoring , feedback available patient primary care physician 12-month period beyond index home care admission . The intervention assess relative usual care . The analysis estimate impact basic augmented intervention nursing practice process care , patient hypertension management ( e.g. , medication adherence ) , BP outcomes , overall cost . Behaviors outcomes measure fixed point time . Measures derive combination primary secondary data , include patient record , patient assessment instrument , patient interview , home BP monitor , urine test , administrative file . Multivariate regression analysis conduct determine intervention effect study outcome , adjust select nurse patient characteristic . Nurse level risk-adjustment include demographic measure might influence practice process care , experience education . Patient-level risk adjustment include demographic , social support , characteristic might influence behavior , service use , BP , health outcome . Estimates treatment-control group difference ( treatment ) generate model test determine extent observe difference nurse patient level attributable alternative intervention strategy .</detailed_description>
