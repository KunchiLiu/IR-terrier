	<detailed_description>Background : Infants passively-transferred maternal antibody ( PMA ) hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) blunt immune response hepatitis A vaccine . We compare immunogenicity hepatitis A vaccine among infant without PMA , vaccinate different schedule . Methods : Infants randomize one three group , receive two dos 720 EL.U . hepatitis A vaccine ( HAVRIX , Glaxo SmithKline ) accord follow schedule : Group 1 age 6 12 month ; Group 2 age 12 18 month ; Group 3 age 15 21 month . We determine antibody HAV ( anti-HAV ) status mother time delivery , measure infant ' anti-HAV concentration time first vaccine dose ( baseline ) , 1 , 7 12 month thereafter . Anti-HAV concentration &gt; 33 milli-International Units/milliliter ( mIU/mL ) consider protective . We monitor adverse reaction use diary card chart review . Results : A total 239 infant enrol , include 134 born anti-HAV negative mother ( Groups 1N , 2N , 3N ) 105 born anti-HAV positive mother ( Groups 1P , 2P , 3P ) . At month 12 , 6 month second vaccine dose , difference GMC Groups 1P 1N statistically significant difference within group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . There statistically significant difference GMC among group infant born anti-HAV negative mother ( `` N '' group ) , difference Group 1P Group 3P infant significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . No serious adverse reaction relate vaccination detect . Conclusions : Hepatitis A vaccine immunogenic among infant bear anti-HAV negative mother , among born anti-HAV positive mother vaccinate begin young 12 month old . The persistence PMA least six month among majority infant bear anti-HAV positive mother result low seroconversion rate GMC 's .</detailed_description>
