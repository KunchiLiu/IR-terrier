	<brief_summary>Immune globulin effective 85 % time prevent hepatitis A people expose , give within 14 day exposure . Several line evidence suggest hepatitis A vaccine might also effective setting , vaccine advantage provide long term protection . In study , compare well immune globulin hepatitis A vaccine work prevent clinical hepatitis A household contact person disease . The study 's hypothesis proportion expose household contact receive hepatitis A vaccine within 14 day exposure develop hepatitis A disease similar proportion exposure household contact receive immune globulin within 14 day exposure develop hepatitis A disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Efficacy Hepatitis A Vaccine Immune Globulin When Given After Exposure Hepatitis A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : An Epidemiologic Study Hepatitis A Vaccine Postexposure Prophylaxis Clinical Phase : Investigation application unrelated original approve use . Primary Objective : To compare clinical efficacy vaccine IG prevention confirm hepatitis A disease give within 14 day exposure confirm case hepatitis A disease . Primary Hypothesis : The proportion initially seronegative subject receive vaccine within 14 day exposure index case hepatitis A disease onset confirm case hepatitis A disease within 56 day exposure similar proportion initially seronegative subject receive IG within 14 day exposure index case onset confirm case hepatitis A disease within 56 day exposure . The date exposure define date onset clinical symptom index case . ( The statistical method examine hypothesis require compute relative risk , correspond 90 % confidence interval , confirm hepatitis A disease among receive vaccine compare receive IG , within 14 day exposure . Inference similarity involve examine upper bound confidence interval translate RR bound low bound 90 % confidence interval vaccine efficacy . Translation relative risk efficacy depend assumption point estimate efficacy IG , base historical data , particular design study assumption regard transmission hepatitis A virus occur study population . ) Study Design Duration : Randomized , double-blinded , comparative , experimental epidemiologic study . Study conduct among exposed contact 2-40 year age household exposure group expect last 18 month . Sample Size : Enrollment continue 44 hepatitis A case randomized subject observe . Assuming 30 % secondary attack rate evaluable , confirm contact index case 90 % efficacy rate IG , observe 44 laboratory-confirmed case hepatitis A , 1468 randomized subject need evaluable ( 734/group ) . Evaluable defined seronegative baseline clinical follow-up data Day 56 . Assuming 90 % subject follow-up data 45 % subject seronegative baseline , 4067 subject age 2 40 year must randomize ( 2038/group ) . The actual enrollment may different base validity assumption . Dosage Route : Within expose group , subject randomize receive either hepatitis A vaccine , VAQTA™ , immune globulin ( IG ) intramuscular ( IM ) . Clinical material administer unblinded study personnel subject tell clinical material administer . The unblinded personnel involve study procedure expose group . Syringes mask avoid possible chance subject unblinding . The dose VAQTA™ use depend subject ’ age . Persons 2 18 year age receive 25-U dose VAQTA™ administer intramuscularly arm 0.5 mL volume . Persons 19 40 year age less equal 75 kg weight receive 50-U dose VAQTA™ administer intramuscularly arm 1.0 mL volume . Persons 19 40 year age great 75 kg weight receive 50-U dose VAQTA™ ( administer two 25-U dos ) administer intramuscularly 0.5 mL arm . Persons 2 18 year age receive IG one arm ; person 19 40 year age less equal 75 kg weight receive IG one arm ; person 19 40 year age great 75 kg weight receive IG total dose equally divide arm . All person randomize receive IG receive dose 0.02 mL/kg body weight , maximum 1.5 mL less equal 75 kg weight 3.0 mL great 75 kg weight . All subject le equal 75 kg receive 1 injection subject 19 40 year age great 75 kg receive 2 injection . Efficacy Measurements : The primary measurement variable efficacy proportion subject confirm hepatitis A disease ( hepatitis A IgM positive serum stool PCR positive HAV RNA ALT twice upper limit normal 1 clinical signs/symptoms hepatitis A disease ) . Safety Measurements : Subjects evaluate serious unusual reaction throughout study period . The rate serious adverse experience group compare . Data Analysis : In study , efficacy comparison make estimation relative risk laboratory-confirmed clinical hepatitis A vaccine group compare IG group . The relative risk calculate follow : - PV PIG incidence rate secondary case confirm hepatitis A disease vaccine immune globulin treatment group , respectively . The primary analysis perform one-sided =0.05 level examine upper bound 90 % confidence relative risk vaccine versus IG . A secondary efficacy analysis adjust exposure group estimation relative risk . The sample size power base upon fixed number event design assume equal incidence rate IG vaccine population one-sided significance level =0.05 , calculate follow test hypothesis : Ho : PV / PIG 3.0 versus Ha : PV / PIG &lt; 3.0 . This equivalent test upper bound 90 % confidence interval observe relative risk &lt; 3.0 . For fixed accrual 44 evaluable secondary case confirm hepatitis A , study 95 % power rule relative risk 3.0 great . If total number case observe study 44 27 ( i.e. , 61.4 % ) case vaccine group , significant evidence reject null hypothesis . If total number case large 44 , maximum number case vaccine group observe still declare success increase accordingly . An internal pilot perform blinded fashion ~25 % 28 case occur . This assessment do check assumption pertain incidence rate use calculate project enrollment . A new sample size projection base upon incidence rate ( total across treatment group ) observe thus far calculated planning/budgetary concern . In addition , interim analysis propose primary endpoint potential early study termination overwhelm evidence vaccine less efficacious IG . The Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) responsible make recommendation whether continue study base result interim analysis relevant safety data . The interim analysis perform 14 ( ~50 % ) 28 expect case laboratory-confirmed clinical hepatitis A observe . Using assumption use original power calculation , probability meeting success criterion end study condition number case observe vaccine group interim analysis calculate . If probability 20 % great vaccine meet assume statistical criterion end study , study definitely continue . In addition , 12 month study start , case observe , IDMC assess need study termination .</detailed_description>
