	<brief_title>NO Need Ventilate : A Trial Non-invasive Inhaled Nitric Oxide Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blending low dose NO gas oxygen inspiratory limb mechanical ventilator effective method reduce pulmonary vascular resistance decrease extrapulmonary right-to-left shunting ductus arteriosus foramen ovale many patient PPHN . However , patient PPHN , sustain elevation PVR may occur absence despite improvement parenchymal lung disease mechanical ventilation need maintain adequate gas exchange . PPN absence pulmonary parenchymal disease despite improvement parenchymal lung disease occur significant subset newborn infant hypoxemic respiratory failure . Inhaled NO effectively deliver non-invasive technique newborn infant PPHN , potentially reduce duration mechanical ventilation , safely treat elevation pulmonary artery pressure right-to-left . A dose 10-20 ppm measure within delivery device sufficient maintain nasopharyngeal concentration within range 1-10 ppm . My co-authors I also report series eleven infant pulmonary hypertension treat low dose iNO deliver via nasal cannula extubation 14th Annual CNMC Symposium ECMO &amp; Advanced Therapies Respiratory Failure , Keystone , CO , 1998 .</detailed_description>
