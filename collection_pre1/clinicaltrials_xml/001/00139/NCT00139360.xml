	<brief_title>Efficacy Bevacizumab Monotherapy Treatment Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Norway , cutaneous malignant melanoma second frequent frequent cancer type middle-aged ( 30-54 year ) females male , respectively , incidence six-doubled last 30 year . Median survival patient metastatic melanoma 6 month . Many agent investigated anti-tumor effect melanoma , accepted standard therapy . Biochemotherapy , combine cytotoxic drug Interleukin-2 Interferon alpha , show superior single agent Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) , regard active agent . Other biological approach like vaccination currently investigation , still efficient treatment metastatic melanoma available . DTIC induces objective remission 20 % patient , without significant impact survival . The need new effective treatment group melanoma patient urgently need . This first study ass response rate bevacizumab monotherapy first line treatment metastatic melanoma . In addition major focus identification predictive biomarkers bevacizumab efficacy .</detailed_description>
