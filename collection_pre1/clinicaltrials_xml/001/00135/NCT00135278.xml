BACKGROUND INFORMATION/STUDY RATIONALE Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries - Epidemiology Research Overview : Few trauma human body suddenly permanently devastate spinal cord injury . Unfortunately , often young , highly productive , otherwise healthy adult sustain injury , thereafter suffer lifelong loss movement , sensation , bowel , bladder , sexual function . In North America , 10,000 people sustain spinal cord injury year , currently estimate 250,000 individual live chronic spinal cord paralysis ( Sekhon Fehlings , 2001 ) . Important advance medical , surgical , rehabilitative treatment improve clinical care spinal cord injure patient past decade . Nevertheless , still convincingly effective treatment currently available improve neurological status patient , , paralysis currently incurable condition . This rather dismal neurologic prognosis stimulate significant research effort understand neurobiology spinal cord injury develop effective therapy . This international effort tremendously increase understanding neuropathology spinal cord injury shed much insight acute chronic pathophysiologic process inhibit neural regeneration functional recovery ( review Kwon et al. , 2002 ) . The large majority research spinal cord repair strategy conceptually divide two stream : - research acute pathophysiologic process occur immediately soon injury , aim develop neuroprotective therapy attenuate process minimize secondary spinal cord damage ; - research intrinsic extrinsic impediment axonal re-growth within central nervous system , aim develop axonal regeneration therapy would promote axonal growth across injure spinal cord thus mediate recovery spinal cord injury ( Kwon et al. , 2004a ) . Pathophysiology Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries - The Role Ischemia : The majority individual sustain spinal cord injury suffer complete transection spinal cord , even functionally complete paralysis . Rather , initial `` primary '' mechanical impact interrupt axon site injury disrupts local neuronal glial cytoarchitecture , proportion spinal cord ( usually outer rim ) escape intact . This spared tissue , however , subject complex cascade acute pathophysiologic process cause `` secondary '' damage . These interrelated process include ionic homeostasis abnormality , excitotoxicity , program cell death , tissue ischemia , inflammation ( Kwon et al. , 2004b ) . Neuroprotective therapy aim counteract process , thereby avert secondary damage maximize extent spar cord tissue . Animal study demonstrate significant neurologic function mediate small amount spar cord tissue , regard , even small neuroprotective effect might reap substantial functional benefit patient . Vascular disruption local tissue ischemia long recognize important aspect secondary damage follow acute traumatic spinal cord injury . Ischemia resultant cellular energy failure think contribute propagation many important pathophysiologic process , regard argue critical component secondary damage ( Amar Levy , 1999 ) . Mechanical disruption microvasculature cause petechial hemorrhage intravascular thrombosis , combination vasospasm intact vessel edema injury site lead profound local hypoperfusion ischemia ( Tator Fehlings , 1991 ) . This primarily microvascular phenomenon , large caliber vessel anterior spinal artery normally spar ( Koyanagi et al. , 1993 ) . Human post-mortem study demonstrate vascular perfusion substantially bad grey matter white matter , may relate disruption and/or thrombosis sulcal arterial network centrifugally supply much grey matter ( Tator Koyanagi , 1997 ) . The high metabolic requirement neuron make grey matter exquisitely sensitive ischemia injury , compound loss autoregulatory mechanism normally maintain fairly constant microvascular hemodynamics within spinal cord systolic blood pressure fluctuation ( Senter Venes , 1979 ) . The loss autoregulation make cord vulnerable ischemic insult systemic hypotension ( Kobrine et al. , 1975 ) . The Role Ischemia Non-Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury : Up point , discussion focus spinal cord injury cause blunt trauma role ischemia play secondary injury cascade . Ischemia alone , however , also primary etiologic process behind paralysis non-traumatic circumstance . Such case patient undergo thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( TAAA ) repair . In surgery , aorta clamp segmental vessel ligate , thus deprive spinal cord blood supply extent influence severity location aneurysm duration vascular occlusion . The incidence paralysis cause ischemic insult estimate 3.8 17.6 % ( Crawford Rubio , 1973 ) , report high 28 41 % repair particular type aneurysm ( Crawford et al. , 1986 ; Safi et al. , 1996 ) . As perioperative paraplegia one devastating complication surgery , number adjunctive treatment investigate prophylactic therapeutic intervention . These include generalized local hypothermia , medication steroid , naloxone , barbiturate , papaverine , reattachment intercostal artery , CSF drainage ( Wan et al. , 2001 ) . In principle , intervention aim reduce spinal cord ischemia either improve vascular perfusion ( increase cellular oxygen supply ) reduce metabolic activity ( decrease cellular oxygen demand ) . CSF Drainage Method Preventing Treating Spinal Cord Ischemia : The drainage CSF emerge accept intervention reduce risk ischemic paralysis patient undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair . An important determinant oxygen supply spinal cord spinal cord perfusion pressure ( SCPP ) , define gradient mean distal aortic arterial pressure ( MDAP ) CSF pressure ( CSFP ) ( WADA et al. , 2001 ) . Conceptually , drainage CSF reduce CSF pressure thus increase perfusion pressure oxygen delivery spinal cord . When cross clamp aorta occurs , distal aortic pressure decrease gradient arterial CSF pressure narrow . Additionally , significant increase CSF pressure demonstrate occur aortic cross-clamping ( WADA et al. , 2001 ) , would serve reduce spinal cord perfusion pressure . The reason increase CSF pressure aortic cross-clamping unclear , may relate change venous capacitance cause sequestration venous blood within dura bony neural axis ( Piano Gewertz , 1990 ) . Seminal animal experiment perform decade ago demonstrate follow descend aortic occlusion , decrease arterial pressure CSF pressure ( decrease SCPP ) almost universally resulted paraplegia , drainage CSF reduce CSF pressure ( thus increase SCPP ) effective prevent paraplegia . ( MIYAMOTO et al. , 1960 ; Oka Miyamoto , 1987 ) . Since , numerous clinical report describe use CSF drainage human undergoing TAAA repair ( review Ling , 2000 [ Ling Arellano , 2000 ] ) . Normal CSF pressure human document approximately 13 15 mmHg ( Drenger et al. , 1997 ) . Increased CSF pressure 21 25 mm Hg demonstrate aortic cross clamping ( Drenger et al. , 1997 ; WADA et al. , 2001 ) . It advocate therefore drain CSF control manner maintain CSF pressure approximately 10 mm Hg TAAA repair ( Carroccio et al. , 2003 ) . A prospective randomized control trial Svensson et al . demonstrate 12 % ( 2 17 ) incidence neurologic deficit patient treat CSF drainage compare 44 % ( 7 16 ) incidence control group ( p=0.0392 ) ( Svensson et al. , 1998 ) . A recent prospective randomize control trial 145 patient Coselli et al . demonstrate intent-to-treat analysis significant reduction paraplegia CSF drainage keep CSF pressure around 10 mmHg ( Coselli et al. , 2002 ) . Neurologic deficit occur 2 82 patient ( 2.7 % ) undergoing CSF drainage 9 74 patient ( 12.2 % ) control group ( p=0.026 ) , represent 80 % reduction relative risk . Both prospective randomize study terminate early plan interim analysis due significant benefit demonstrate CSF drainage . Of note , complication relate CSF drainage , headache , meningitis , subdural hemorrhage observe study . These prospective randomized study illustrate potential efficacy CSF drainage prevent paraplegia spinal cord subject ischemic insult . In addition , CSF drainage report effective treatment case ischemic insult already result paraplegia . Such report obviously relevant traumatic spinal cord injuries ischemic damage would likely already present time CSF drainage institute . Ackerman Traynelis report institution CSF drainage 6 patient suffer ischemic paralysis , 5 12 40 hour post-TAAA repair ( Ackerman Traynelis , 2002 ) . In four patient CSF drainage start within 14 hour onset ischemic symptom , significant neurologic recovery achieve . In three patient , neurologic recovery occur immediately CSF catheter insert . In two patient CSF drainage start 32 27 hour onset symptom , neurologic recovery observe . Safi et al . report initiation CSF drainage 8 patient present neurologic deficit 1 14 day TAAA repair ( Safi et al. , 1997 ) . They observe substantial neurologic recovery least 2 Frankel grade 8 patient . The interpretation result require acknowledgement fact treatment steroids vascular support also institute , suggest principle modulate spinal cord perfusion pressure CSF drainage still applicable patient already suffer ischemic injury spinal cord . The Inflammatory Reaction Spinal Cord Injury CSF Cytokines : As state earlier , secondary damage spinal cord initial mechanical impact mediate number pathophysiologic process , include ionic homeostasis abnormality , excitotoxicity , program cell death , tissue ischemia , inflammation . The precede discussion focus tissue ischemia might affect CSF drainage . Inflammation appear also play important role pathophysiology acute spinal cord injury , thus focus increase attention recent year . The inflammatory response spinal cord injury mediate cytokine influence vascular permeability regulate migration inflammatory cell neutrophils macrophage spinal cord ( Kwon et al. , 2004b ) . The list cytokine think relevant inflammatory response spinal cord injury long , include IL-1 , IL-1 , TNF , IL-6 , IL-10 , VEGF , variety leukotrienes . ( Mueller et al. , 2003 ; Widenfalk et al. , 2003 ; Mitsuhashi et al. , 1994 ; Xu et al. , 1990 ; Bartholdi Schwab , 1997 ; Carmel et al. , 2001 ; Hayashi et al. , 2000 ; Pan et al. , 2002 ; Wang et al. , 1997 ) Recently , study injure spinal cord 11 patient die shortly trauma demonstrate presence IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF positive cell within spinal cord within 24 hour injury . ( Yang et al. , 2004 ) While aspect inflammatory immunologic response mediate cytokine may beneficial spinal cord injury , others may detrimental . ( Bethea , 2000 ) For example , contusion spinal cord injury , transgenic mouse lack TNF receptor find increased apoptosis , large area secondary injury , bad locomotor score wild-type mouse . ( Kim et al. , 2001 ) Conversely , systemic administration IL-10 significantly reduce neuronal damage excitotoxic spinal cord injury . ( Brewer et al. , 1999 ) A sophisticated understanding complex response obviously need . Nevertheless , animal study demonstrate proof concept manipulation cytokine responses potential influence outcome spinal cord injury , therefore , may represent target neuroprotective intervention . The level expression cytokine appear change time temporal specificity expression likely also influence inflammatory response . Are CSF Cytokine Measurements Representative Events Cord ? : Without question , direct method examine cytokine response spinal cord injury would obtain sample cord . While largely method phenomenon examine animal model , obviously possible living human patient . The recent study Yang et al . evaluate spinal cord tissue patient die , sample CSF determine closely cord change reflect CSF space . In rat spinal cord contusion injury model , Wang et al . demonstrated increase IL-1 spinal cord tissue CSF . ( Wang et al. , 1997 ) While IL-10 concentration much low CSF cord , increase IL-10 CSF spinal cord injury parallel increase observe cord . These animal data suggest cytokine analysis CSF provide meaningful data happen within cord . There , knowledge , one human study examine cytokine level within CSF patient acute blunt spinal cord injury . This study examine level eicosanoids , LTC4 , TXB2 , 6-keto-PGF1 0 17 day post-injury , 6 month post-injury . ( Nishisho et al. , 1996 ) These author find increase three eicosanoids , find LTC4 level correlate extent injury severity . In study patient undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair ( possibly induce ischemic insult spinal cord ) , Kunihara et al . demonstrate increased level IL-8 independent serum level , particular note sustained IL-8 elevation patient unfortunately become paraplegic operation . ( Kunihara et al. , 2001 ) In study CSF adult patient severe brain injury , Csuka et al demonstrated increase IL-10 independent serum IL-10 level . ( Csuka et al. , 1999 ) While direct comparison spinal cord tissue possible human study , suggest CNS injury associate cytokine change detect CSF . The involvement cytokine inflammatory process presence CSF raise potential additional benefit CSF drainage yet explore human . Kunihara colleague demonstrate significant increase pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) within spinal cord New Zealand white rabbit subject aortic cross-clamping ( Kunihara et al. , 2000 ) . They go show level IL-8 ( addition inflammatory cytokine IL-10 IL-6 ) significantly elevate CSF human patient undergo TAAA repair . Interestingly , patient series suffer ischemic paraplegia TAAA dramatically increase sustained level IL-8 within CSF ( Kunihara et al. , 2001 ) . It propose author others drainage pro-inflammatory CSF cytokines away spinal cord may neuroprotective ( Kunihara et al. , 2001 ; Tang et al. , 1996 ; Svensson et al. , 1998 ) . This hypothesis , however , evaluate traumatic non-traumatic spinal cord injury . As yet , unclear much CSF would need drained order achieve `` effective '' reduction local cytokine concentration . Summary : In summary , drainage CSF show human clinical study neuroprotective set ischemic injury spinal cord , respect prevention treatment . Given ischemia also well recognize contributor secondary injury cascade follow traumatic spinal cord injury , cogent rationale evaluation CSF drainage setting , acknowledge desperate need development effective treatment patient . To knowledge , previously report evaluation CSF drainage human patient suffer acute traumatic spinal cord injury . Also , give enormous current worldwide interest inflammatory response spinal cord injury , reasonable conclude promise experimental neuroprotective intervention forthcoming within near future . If strategy move animal model within laboratory set human patient , would extremely useful characterize inflammatory response human compare available animal data . Such knowledge would helpful predict experimental therapy would beneficial , also would helpful definition parameter monitor effectiveness therapeutic intervention . In regard , change cytokines/chemokines may become additional outcome measure evaluation therapeutic efficacy . Moreover , insight gain may direct laboratory ( animal ) study towards clinically relevant parameter .</detailed_description>
