	<brief_title>Pre-Transplant Treatment Prevent Recurrence Hepatitis C After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients await deceased donor liver transplant ask enroll protocol time identification potential living liver donor ( see note note end description ) . Patients randomize treatment arm encourage delay live donor liver transplant ( LDLT ) receive 12 week treatment allow treatment response , , occur . The pros con immediate versus delay LDLT discussed patient ; time LDLT patient randomize treatment determine clinical need . There separate treatment strategy depend upon HCV genotype . Preliminary data experience strongly suggest interferon-based treatment clear HCV RNA majority patient genotypes 2 3 , even low standard dos ( 79 % on-treatment response 50 % SVR ) . In contrast , clearance rate genotype 1 patient advanced cirrhosis may 28 % on-treatment 11 % SVR . In addition , treatment may associate significant side effect , intolerance , increase risk complication liver disease . The HCV Committee A2ALL strongly agree monitor safety pre-transplant antiviral therapy essential advise inclusion untreated control group . For reason , patient HCV , genotypes 1 , 4 , 5 , &amp; 6 infection randomize 2:1 either treatment control ( treatment ) . Randomization web-based avoid prior knowledge treatment assignment site . In contrast randomized design patient genotypes 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , patient genotypes 2 3 HCV receive treatment . All genotype include analysis safety , tolerance , complication occur pre-transplant treatment . Treatment continue time LDLT decease donor liver transplant ( DDLT ) , maximum 48 week continuous treatment . Both peginterferon ribavirin stop transplantation expect occur within 24 hour . Patients whose liver disease stabilize long need liver transplant complete full 48 week treatment aim achieve SVR . These patient follow measurement HCV RNA , biochemical test , hematology , clinical evaluation 3 , 6 , 12 month post-treatment . If relapse occurs treatment discontinue 48 week therapy , institution retreatment discretion investigator . Deferral LDLT antiviral therapy continue consider patient undetectable HCV RNA , tolerate treatment well , lack evidence HCC ongoing hepatic decompensation , stabilization improvement clinical biochemical measure liver disease : Child-Turcotte-Pugh ( CTP ) Model End-stage Liver Disease ( MELD ) score . These patient lack uncontrolled ongoing bleed portal hypertension , ascites , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , encephalopathy . The decision defer transplantation continue antiviral therapy make transplant center clinical investigator consultation patient . Based upon kinetics early virologic response peginterferon + ribavirin clinical trial , researcher anticipate minimum 12 week treatment necessary achieve virologic response . However , optimum duration pre-transplant antiviral therapy yield high rate prevention post-transplant HCV recurrence unknown . Prolongation antiviral therapy beyond 12 week may advantageous regard , prolong therapy may also increase risk development intercurrent complication liver disease side effect treatment . In addition , patient stable liver disease achieve virologic remission may experience hepatic improvement avoid transplantation . All patient , treat untreated control follow tested interval unless specify . Unscheduled visit additional test may perform clinically indicate , finding visit result additional test record database . The follow detail schedule visit tests/procedures perform visit : Baseline - History Physical Examination - Vital sign : Weight , blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , Temperature - Fundoscopic exam patient . In patient hypertension diabetes exam perform pupil dilate - Quality Life Depression Assessment ( SF-36V2 , Beck Depression Inventory ) - Functional status evaluation - Symptom assessment - HCV RNA - HCV Genotype - Urinalysis - Pregnancy Test - HIV Test - Other blood test , include : complete blood count ( CBC ) , International Normalized . Ratio ( INR ) , Liver Panel , Creatine , Sodium Alpha-fetoprotein , triglyceride , iron study , uric acid , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) - Ultrasound ( US ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( probably do LDLT evaluation ) Week 0 ( Randomization and/or Treatment Start ) - Confirm eligibility - Initiate treatment genotype 2 , 3 patient genotype 1 , 4 , 5 6 patient randomized treatment group - Repeat CBC , chemistry , INR After randomization - Week 1 3 : CBC ( treated patient , may perform local lab ) - Every 2 week 12 week : CBC , chemistries - Weeks 4 8 : Focused physical exam ( sign symptoms liver disease ) vital sign , urinalysis symptom assessment - Every 4 week 12 48 week : Full physical exam vital sign , urinalysis symptom assessment , CBC , chemistry . - Every 12 week 48 week : INR , TSH , urine serum pregnancy test female ( treated subject childbearing capacity ) - At 12 Weeks : HCV RNA measure . Patients without 2-log drop HCV RNA level declare nonresponders treatment discontinue . - After 12 week : HCV RNA measure every 12 week treatment quantitative test . - At time LDLT DDLT : CBC , INR , chemistry , quantitative qualitative HCV RNA , Medications , adverse event ( AE ) - Blood sample collect Treatment Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 time transplantation subsequent HCV RNA test central lab - Quality life ( QOL ) assessment week 12 , 24 48 : Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) SF-36V2 - Patients discontinue treatment early due adverse event follow accord study schedule 12 month transplant 48 week randomization . Post-LT ( LDLT DDLT ) Follow-up - Week 12 , 24 52 : CBC , INR , chemistry , HCV RNA quantitative testing ( part A2ALL prospective study ) - Week 12 , 24 52 : Full physical exam vital sign , urinalysis symptom assessment - Week 12 : TSH urine serum pregnancy test ( treated subject childbearing capacity ) - Week 12 , 24 52 : QOL Assessment ( BDI , SF-36V2 ) - Week 12 52 : Liver Biopsy ( part A2ALL prospective study ) . Pathologists read 3 12 month biopsy blind patient ' clinical course treatment . - Blood sample collect Week 12 , 24 52 subsequent HCV RNA test central laboratory Follow-up Patients complete 48 week Treatment without Transplantation - Week 12 , 24 48 : CBC , INR , chemistry , HCV RNA quantitative test - Week 12 , 24 48 : Full physical exam vital sign , urinalysis symptom assessment - Week 12 : TSH urine serum pregnancy test ( treated subject childbearing capacity ) - Week 12 , 24 48 : QOL Assessment ( BDI , SF-36V2 ) - Blood sample collect Week 12 , 24 48 subsequent HCV RNA test central laboratory NOTE : As result LADR Protocol Amendment III , patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) tumor stage T2 await DDLT eligible participate LADR study .
