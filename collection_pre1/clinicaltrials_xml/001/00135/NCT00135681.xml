	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma result dysregulated immune response inhale antigen . The development immune response dominate T cell ( Th2 ) secrete interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) IL-5 result constellation finding associate asthma , include elevate IgE increase blood eosinophilia . Epidemiological study indicate several predispose factor may dictate whether asthma may develop certain individual include genetic , environmental , age-related factor . Any one factor alone may determine whether inappropriate immune response develop subsequent development asthma ; rather , asthma likely result combination factor . However , Th2 response lung occur , hypothesis dominates result development Th2 response inhale neoantigens . Further , acquire predisposition Th2 response may override preexist predispose factor therefore becomes prime target asthma therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study subproject Specialized Center Research ( SCOR ) Fibrotic Lung Disease 1997 2001 . Both normal asthmatic subject immunize neoantigen , keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) , via intrapulmonary subcutaneous route observe type antibody T cell response develop . Furthermore , effect inhale anti-inflammatory medication primary immune response KLH assess . Additional study examine effect regional pulmonary Th2 responses peripheral blood asthma-associated effector cell , basophil eosinophil . Finally , investigator determine whether chronic therapy asthmatic child either nedocromil budesonide modulate immune response systemically administer neoantigen , hepatitis B vaccine . These study design provide important information regulation immune response human asthma . Furthermore , help determine whether anti-inflammatory medication could inhibit development Th2 responses prevent inflammatory event downstream Th2 development . The subproject three specific aim . The first test hypothesis lower respiratory tract asthmatic would respond differently neo-antigen . In part A specific aim 1 , low respiratory tract asthmatic challenge KLH . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) repeat 12 day blood sample collect number time point . Immunoglobulins measure blood BAL , lymphocytes collect BAL assayed response antigen vitro test . In part B , individual treat six week anti-inflammatory therapy response intrapulmonary antigen assess . Specific aim 2 assessed role acute challenge lung antigen eosinophil basophil responsiveness . The lung challenge intrapulmonary installation antigen bronchoscope sample collect peripheral blood various time point . An allergen challenge perform six week therapy nedocromil budesonide placebo . In specific aim 3 , asthmatic child test two stage . In stage one , preliminary study perform child relatively mild asthma immunize hepatitis vaccine . Samples collect various time point assay antigen-specific antibody . The hypothesis asthmatic child would Th2 type response rather Th1 type response normal child evaluate determine time sample could collect large Childhood Asthma Management Program ( CAMP ) study .</detailed_description>
