	<detailed_description>The role antiplatelet therapy ( chiefly aspirin ) secondary prevention heart attack stroke firmly establish many high-risk people diagnose arterial disease , proportional reduction cardiovascular event appear one quarter , whether patient diabetes . But , young middle-aged people diabetes manifest arterial disease - although still significant cardiovascular risk - yet trial test aspirin individual . As result , substantial uncertainty role aspirin prevention heart attack stroke among apparently healthy people diabetes , small minority receives . There consistent evidence observational study lower rate cardiovascular disease ( particularly cardiac sudden death ) people higher intake , high blood level , fish oil ( omega-3 fatty acid ) . Trials people survive heart attack show modest , potentially worthwhile , reduction coronary event . There , however , large-scale trial use fish oil prevention vascular event people without diagnose arterial disease . If ASCEND reliably demonstrate aspirin and/or fish oil safely reduce risk cardiovascular event deaths people diabetes pre-existing arterial disease , would relevant ten million people world-wide ( currently receive therapy ) might save ten thousand life year .</detailed_description>
