	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Consolidation Treatment With Iodine I 131 Tositumomab Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma rank second hematological malignancy United States ( Munshi et al. , 2001 ) . Because curable option exists , patient early stage disease typically observe without treatment disease progress symptom appear . The majority patient respond initial chemotherapy , however , treat patient repeatedly relapse short remission follow subsequent course chemotherapy ( Rajkumar et al. , 2002a ) . Regimens commonly use initial therapy include melphalan prednisone ( MP ) , induce remission approximately 50 % patient ( Alexanian et al. , 1969 ) , VAD—vincristine , adriamycin dexamethasone response rate 50 % range ( Salmon et al. , 1994 ; Barlogie et al. , 1984 ; Alexanian et al. , 1986 ) , dexamethasone pulse , recently introduce combination thalidomide dexamethasone ( Rajkumar et al. , 2002b ; Weber et al. , 2003 ) . All regimens comparable response rate . With exception recent report , show superior response rate combination thalidomide dexamethasone versus dexamethasone pulse ( Rajkumar et al. , 2004 ) , multiple comparative study show superiority regimens overall survival . Complete response regimens observe infrequently ( &lt; 5 % ) . Patients complete initial therapy , usually proceed high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant support . Alternatively , patient may place maintenance regimen observe . Except one study alternate day high dose Prednisone ( Berenson et al. , 2002 ) , convince evidence exists maintenance impact natural history disease ( Kyle , 2002 ; The Myeloma Trialists ' Collaborative Group , 2001 ) . High dose chemotherapy use consolidation multiple myeloma number investigator ( Barlogie et al. , 1986 ; Cunningham et al. , 1994 ; Harousseau et al. , 1995 ) . A randomized trial conduct French Myeloma Intergroup ( IFM 90 ) provide evidence treatment high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) initial therapy result significantly longer event-free survival ( median 28 vs. 18 month ) overall survival ( 57 vs. 42 month ) compare conventional chemotherapy ( Attal et al. , 1996 ) . The benefit auto transplantation see patient age ( Siegel et al. , 1999 ) . More recently , similar result report large randomized study Great Britain ( Childs et al. , 2003 ) . Based study , patient eligible transplant , consolidation initial therapy high dose therapy follow ASCT consider standard care ( NCCN Guidelines 2004 ) . However , ASCT curative even patient achieve complete response ( CR ) , observe 20-30 % patient complete ASCT . Contamination autologous stem cell collection malignant myeloma cell may play role . In support notion , syngeneic bone marrow transplant show well durable outcome see ASCT ( Gahrton et al. , 1999 ) . Another reason failure autologous stem cell transplant ineffective eradication myeloma clone high dose chemotherapy . In effort provide effective elimination malignant clone , investigator develop intensified treatment regimen . Improved result report use Total Therapy , involve sequence treatment , include tandem ASCT ( Barlogie et al. , 1999 , Barlogie al. , 2004 ) . The notion intensification therapy improve outcomes validated recent randomize study , show consolidation initial therapy tandem autologous stem cell transplant superior consolidation single autologous stem cell transplant measure improved duration response overall survival ( Attal al , 2003 ) . In contrast ASCT , allogeneic stem cell transplantation provide stem cell product free malignant cell , well benefit graft-versus-myeloma effect . However , high 1-year mortality ( 30-60 % ) report early allogeneic bone marrow transplant study , disease free survival 15-30 % patient superior survival compare ASCT ( Bensinger et al. , 1996 ; Bjorkstrand et al. , 1996 ; Barlogie et al. , 1995 ) . More recent study , include allogeneic transplant nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen , provide encourage result ( Reynolds et al. , 2001 ; Badros et al. , 2002 ) . Recently , combine treatment ASCT follow non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant show promising outcome improve , although still significant toxicity , CR rate 55-60 % range ( Kroger et al. , 2002 ; Maloney et al. , 2003 ) . It early determine whether improved response use approach result increase survival . Emerging data suggest achieve CR near CR ( nCR ) result durable remission longer survival . Recent analysis long term outcomes patient treat randomized French study IMG90 clearly indicate long survivor patient achieve least good partial response complete response ( Harousseau , 2003 ) . At 7 year , 60 % patient alive group , achieve CR near CR . In contrast , group patient achieve &gt; PR le CR near CR 30 % alive among patient less PR none alive . Similar result bee recently report patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant ( Corradini et al. , 2003 ) . It clear whether CR response initial therapy prior transplant may similar impact overall outcome . Regardless specific transplant approach , survival curve plateau patient expect relapse , regardless method intensification therapy , possibly due persistence residual population chemotherapy-resistant clonogenic myeloma cell . For patient relapsed refractory therapy , agree upon standard treatment ( Anderson et al. , 2002 ; Kyle , 2002 ) . Treatment option include salvage chemotherapy , autologous stem cell transplant ( previously do second transplant ) , allogeneic stem cell transplant , full low intensity ( Kyle , 2002 ) . Salvage chemotherapy widely use clinical practice . Among variety salvage regimen , monotherapy combination therapy apply . Monotherapy Dexamethasone steroid administer pulse therapy produce response 35-40 % range ( Alexanian et al. , 1983 ; Gertz et al. , 1995 ) . Thalidomide use single agent show 32 % response rate patient population ( Singhal et al. , 1999 ) . More recently , VELCADE single agent induce least minimal response ( i.e . &gt; 25 % reduction monoclonal protein ) 35 % patient least stabilization disease 59 % patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma use strict SWOG criterion ( Richardson et al. , 2003 ) . Combination therapies historically show high response rate . VAD demonstrate effective regimen patient refractory alkylating agent , response rate 60 % ( Lokhorst et al. , 1989 ) . A similar regimen call DVd , Doxil , Vincristine , dexamethasone , show comparable efficacy acceptable toxicity ( Hussein et al. , 2002 ; Rifkin et al. , 2004 ) . Newer combination , include combination VELCADE , thalidomide , Revlimid ( analog thalidomide ) promising , appear able induce high response rate complete remission per unpublished yet report different meeting ( Agarwal et al , 2003 ; Orlowski et al , 2003 , Richardson et al , 2003 ; Richardson et al. , 2004 ) . Clonogenic Multiple Myeloma Cells : Myeloma characterize accumulation malignant plasma cell bone marrow . Numerous observation indicate malignant plasma cell low proliferative capacity believe vast majority malignant cell population myeloma represent terminally differentiate plasma cell , similar normal counterpart ( Barlogie et al. , 1989 ) . It unclear whether terminally differentiate malignant plasma cell capable self-renewal . During past decade , several study indicate multiple myeloma , similarly malignancy , may consist heterogenous population malignant cell ( Bakkus et al. , 1994 ; Billadeau et al. , 1996 ) . Clonotypic study identify population circulate B-cells blood sample patient myeloma ( Bergsagel et al. , 1995 , Chen Epstein , 1996 ) , share clonotypic CDR3 region detect bone marrow malignant plasma cell ( Pilarski et al , 1996 , Szczepek et al. , 1998 ) . Further study provide additional insight evolution myeloma clone support notion heterogeneity population clonal cell myeloma ( Taylor et al. , 2002 ) . The B-cell component myeloma clone appear clonogenic xenografted mouse ( Pilarski et al. , 2000 ; Reiman et al. , 2001 ) . Moreover , clonotypic cell B-cell phenotype express CD19+/CD20+ antigens may represent reservoir disease persist therapy , include high dose chemotherapy ( Kiel et al. , 1999 ; Rottenburger et al. , 1999 ; Pilarski et al. , 2002 ) . The majority myeloma cell express CD138 , highly specific surface antigen terminally differentiate plasma cell , absent highly proliferative normal plasmablast earlier stage B-cells ( Jego et al. , 2001 ) . Based observation , hypothesize clonogenic myeloma cell lack CD138 expression . Using CD138+ CD138- subset cell isolated myeloma cell line primary myeloma patient sample , Matsui et al . ( 2004 ) , show minority myeloma cell CD138- phenotype ( &lt; 5 % ) . However , CD138- clonogenic potential , demonstrate colony formation assay methylcellulose transplantation NOD/SCID mouse . Moreover , cell express B-cell antigen , include CD19 CD20 growth could inhibit vitro treatment rituximab , antibody direct CD20 antigen ( Matsui et al. , 2004 ) . Rationale anti-CD20 Therapy Myeloma : Recent observation clonogenic cell myeloma express CD20 ( Kiel et al , 1999 , Rottenburger et al , 1999 ) growth could inhibit vitro rituximab , anti-CD20 antibody ( Matsui et al , 2004 ) , provide rationale use CD20-directed therapy patient myeloma . Moreover , CD19+/CD20+ clonotypic cell appear refractory CD19-/CD20- cell commonly use chemotherapy regimen myeloma include high dose therapy stem cell transplant ( Kiel et al. , 1999 , Rottenburger et al , 1999 ) . Therefore , CD20+ direct treatment myeloma would complement chemotherapy target chemoresistant clonogenic myeloma cell . Previous study show therapy Rituximab , unlabeled anti-CD20 antibody , could active multiple myeloma ( Hussein et al . 1999 , Treon et al , 2002 ) . In study , propose apply therapy Bexxar , radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody . Bexxar Therapeutic Regimen compose murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Tositumomab Iodine I 131 Tositumomab . Iodine I 131 Tositumomab radio-iodinated derivative Tositumomab covalently link Iodine-131 . We hypothesize radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody efficacious unlabeled antibody ( i.e . rituximab ) eradication highly radiosensitive myeloma cell , similarly observe non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( Horning et al. , 2000 ; Davis et al , 2001 Flinn et al , 2001 ; Witzig et al , 2002 ) . It presume , high efficacy radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibody , compare unlabeled antibody , may due `` crossfire effect '' radiation deliver target cell also neighbor cell , express not-expressing CD20 ( Vose et al , 1999 ) . In proposed design , apply Bexxar completion course initial chemotherapy newly diagnose patient course salvage chemotherapy , provide patient achieve least partial response prior therapy ( i.e . &gt; 50 % reduction tumor mass ) reach plateau response prior therapy . By use patient period stable disease , good chance observe effect radioimmunotherapy CD20+ cell , represent minority malignant cell . In addition , evaluate impact Bexxar therapy clonogenic myeloma cell use clonogenic assay describe Methods . We anticipate majority newly diagnose patient eligible subsequently proceed autologous stem cell transplant part standard therapy myeloma ( NCCN Guidelines 2004 ) , hypothesize , bexxar treatment potential eliminate clonogenic myeloma stem cell ; stem cell collect post-bexxar treatment deplete re-populating myeloma cell . Therefore , combination chemotherapy target therapy clonogenic cell may potential eliminate myeloma clone . Although stem cell collection autologous stem cell transplant use without apparent difficulty past patient treat anti-CD20 radio-conjugates ( Ratanatharatorn et al , 2001 ; Kaminski et al , 2001 ; Ansell et al , 2002 ) , plan collect backup stem cell prior treatment Bexxar , allow proceed standard stem cell transplant unlikely case failure collection stem cell post-Bexxar . Anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy previously use combination chemotherapy without additional toxicity ( Emmanoulides et al , 2001 ; Gregory et al , 2001 , Press et al , 2003 ) . Radioimmunotherapy B-Cell Malignancies : Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody efficacious treat B-cell malignancy follow reason : B-lymphocytes , lymphoma , myeloma cell inherently sensitive radiotherapy ( Parker et al , 1980 ) ; local emission ionize radiation radiolabeled antibody may kill cell without target antigen close proximity bound antibody ; penetrate radiation may obviate problem limited access bulky poorly vascularize tumor . Early investigation therapeutic radiolabeled antibody B-cell lymphoma perform iodinated antibody ( Press et al , 1989 ; Kaminski et al , 1993 ; Wahl et al , 1994 ; Press et al , 1995 ) . Currently , two treatment regimen approve treatment relapsed/refractory transform follicular lymphoma . The Bexxar Treatment Regimen include murine anti-CD20 antibody Tositumomab iodinate Iodine I 131 . The Main anti-tumor effect come high energy beta particle emit I 131 . In addition , I 131 emit also low energy gamma radiation , allow gamma camera measurement calculation individualize dose radioactive tracer give patient therapeutic phase ( see ) . In Zevalin , murine anti-CD20 antibody ibritumomab covalently link 90Yttrium ( 90Y ) , pure beta emitter . Lack gamma radiation 90Y allow dosimetric assessment fix dose Zevalin use patient base weight . This possibly result either under- overdosing patient . In addition treatment follicular lymphoma , ongoing study explore possibility treatment either Bexxar Zevalin B-cell malignancy . In particular , anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy appear promising part treatment mantle cell lymphoma , large cell lymphoma , Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . Iodine I 131 Tositumomab Background : Tositumomab murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody direct CD20 antigen , find surface normal malignant B lymphocyte . Tositumomab produce antibiotic-free culture mammalian cell compose two murine gamma 2a heavy chain 451 amino acid two lambda light chain 220 amino acid . The approximate molecular weight Tositumomab 150 kD . In vitro study demonstrate upon bind CD20 antigen , Tositumomab capable induce apoptosis . In addition , Tositumomab induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( CDC ) . Iodine I 131 Tositumomab radio-iodinated derivative Tositumomab covalently link Iodine-131 . Unbound radio-Iodine reactant remove chromatographic purification step . This agent produce cytotoxic effect antitumor effect ionize radiation , well direct antitumor effect antibody . The goal treatment Iodine I 131 Tositumomab selective delivery radiotherapy radiosensitive malignant cell , thus minimize toxicity normal organ . Bexxar Clinical Experience : The dose regimen maximally tolerate dose Bexxar establish phase I/II single-center study conduct University Michigan ( Kaminski et al , 2000 ) . The RIT-II-001 trial include 47 patient design validate dosing methodology develop Michigan ( Vose et al , 2000 ) . The RIT-II-002 trial randomize 78 patient receive either tositumomab I 131-tositumomab regimen unlabeled tositumomab determine value add radionuclide component ( Davis et al , 2001 ) . Patients treat radiolabeled antibody arm show high overall response rate ( OR = 55 % vs. 19 % ) complete response rate ( CR = 33 % vs. 8 % ) . The RIT-II-004 study enrol 60 patient chemotherapy-refractory disease ( response response last less 6 month last chemotherapy receive ) ass efficacy Bexxar therapeutic regimen patient population ( Kaminski et al , 2001 ) . The number patient achieve long duration response Bexxar 5 time higher number patient long duration chemotherapy ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . In addition , patient treat Bexxar achieve high overall response ( OR ) rate ( 47 % vs. 12 % ) complete response ( CR ) rate ( 20 % vs. 2 % ) patient treat chemotherapy . In summary , 4 initial study , include Phase I/II trial , show high response rate duration responses patient relapse refractory low grade follicular lymphoma , include transform follicular lymphoma previously-treated chemotherapy . Most remarkably , patient achieve complete response experience often particularly long duration response last year . In recognition remarkable activity , FDA approve expanded indication Bexxar Therapeutic Regimen January 3 , 2005 .</detailed_description>
