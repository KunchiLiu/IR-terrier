	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine put local anesthetic—or numb medication—through tiny tube next nerve go knee improve pain control physical therapy , ultimately improve result surgery . It also determine patient knee replacement surgery may receive good pain control home compare staying hospital , improve experience follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Following Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What procedures would do part normal clinical care ( even participate research ) ? You monitor place ( blood-pressure cuff ) give medicine intravenous ( IV ) line make sleepy . The anesthesiologist place nerve block much knee ( ) numb . At time , anesthesiologist place tiny tube , call catheter , near nerve use surgery . You still go sleep surgery , much comfortable wake numb medicine work take away much pain . If part study , would go recovery room room hospital 3-5 day , catheter would remove morning follow surgery . After catheter remove , would depend oral IV opioids—or pain medicine—to control surgical pain . You would go home oral opioids since IV opioids provide home . What procedures do participate research study ? From recovery room go Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) special part hospital research undertaken . During stay CRC ability push button small infusion pump give medicine tube nerve pain . If help enough , take pain pill help . And help enough , give opioids ( strong pain medicine like morphine ) IV . Each morning surgery , medicine little infusion pump replace either ( 1 ) medicine , ( 2 ) salt water , `` normal saline '' . The pharmacist determine randomly—like flip coin—and neither doctors/nurses care know . This keep u inadvertently/unconsciously affect result study . However , pain control pain pill , switch back regular medicine improve comfort follow morning . You undergo physical therapy follow check see ready go home . When ready go home beginning third day surgery , may go home little infusion pump tube go nerve knee . One study physicians call night ensure comfortable first 7 night surgery , give phone pager number physician available contact 24 hours/day , 7 days/week . When medicine run fourth even follow surgery , whichever come first , catheter remove . The pump disposable , thrown away . A physician call two night catheter come ensure comfortable .</detailed_description>
