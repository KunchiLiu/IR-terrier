	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Alefacept Treatment Moderate Severe Erosive Mucosal Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lichen planus inflammatory disorder affect skin , mucous membrane ( skin mouth vagina ) , nails , hair . It think T-cells ( cell help fight infection ) become activate multiply faster normal contributes development skin sore . Alefacept work slow rate T-cells become activate helps decrease number T-cells . By block activity decrease number T-cells Alefacept may help improve disease decrease sores skin . Participants study randomly assign receive either alefacept placebo . A placebo look like study drug contains active medication . Placebos help study doctor find effect study drug due drug study . This type study design help measure true effectiveness treatment . Participants 1 2 chance receive alefacept 1 2 chance receive placebo . Neither participant study doctor know group participant assign . The researcher expect enroll 26 subject study research sit U.S. About 16 subject enrol Brigham Women 's Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital . Biogen Idec. , Inc. maker alefacept sponsor study . If take part another research study take part research study last 28 day , individual able take part study . Patients multiple study simultaneously ; however , exception make non-invasive , non-interventional , observational study . This study last 24 week , total 16 visit ; screen week 0 ( baseline ) , week 1-12 , week 16 week 24 . Participants allow use oral injectable medication lichen planus study . Participants also allow use certain cream lichen planus study . The study consist weekly injection medication 12 week 12 week follow period . All participant must least 18 year age diagnosis moderate severe mucosal lichen planus . Neither pregnant nursing woman include study .</detailed_description>
