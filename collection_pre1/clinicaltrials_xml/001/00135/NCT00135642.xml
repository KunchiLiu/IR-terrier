	<brief_title>Grass Pollen Immunotherapy Using Cluster Regime Seasonal Rhinitis Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . The main aim study assess effect grass pollen immunotherapy symptom , bronchial hyperresponsiveness , quality life seasonal rhinitis asthma . Forty-four patient severe summer hay fever ( 36 report seasonal chest symptom 28 seasonal bronchial hyperresponsiveness ) participate randomised double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . After symptom monitor one summer , participant match placebo injection ( n=22 ) rapid up-dosing cluster regimen 4 week , follow monthly injection 2 year . Outcome measure include hay fever symptom medication use , health-related quality life , measurement non-specific bronchial responsiveness . Results : Significant reduction observe immunotherapy group compare placebo group hay fever symptom ( 49 % , 15 % : P = 0.1 ) , medication score ( 80 % , 18 % ; P=.007 ) , seasonal chest symptom ( 90 % , 11 % ; P &lt; .05 ) . Impairment overall quality life ( mean score 7 domain ) pollen season less immunotherapy group placebo group ( median difference [ 95 % CI ] , 0.8 [ 0.18-1.5 ] ; P=.05=2 ] . During pollen season , change airway methacholine PC20 ( provocation concentration produce 20 % fall FEV1 ) immunotherapy-treated group ( P=5 ) , compare almost 3 doubling-dose decrease placebo-treated group ( P=.5 ) , compare almost 3 double dose decrease placebo-treated group ( P=.01 , between-group difference ) . There significant local systemic side effect study . Conclusion : Grass pollen immunotherapy improve quality life seasonal allergic rhinitis reduces seasonal asthma symptom bronchial hyperresponsiveness . Note : Ongoing mechanistic study nasal biopsy study 2008</detailed_description>
