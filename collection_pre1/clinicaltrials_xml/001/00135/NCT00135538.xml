	<brief_title>The Additional Value Noninvasive Ventilation Next Rehabilitation Hypercapnic COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several randomise controlled trial patient stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) demonstrate pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) improve dyspnoea , exercise tolerance , health-related quality life . Research field important department several year . The first study respect start 1986 compare outpatient rehabilitation rehabilitation community patient severe COPD . This study show rehabilitation supervise physical therapist community effective long period contrast outpatient rehabilitation . In 1990 second study start show positive initial benefit home base rehabilitation quality life maintain 18 month patient visit local physical therapist month . However , less positive effect rehabilitation report severe patient . Because dyspnoea due inspiratory muscle fatigue patient may receive adequate training stimulus , therefore rehabilitation might less effective . In severe patient alternative therapy need . These non-pharmacological treatment include nutritional supplementation , oxygen therapy , lung transplantation , lung volume reduction surgery ventilatory support . The last year discussion within 4 home mechanical ventilation centre ( HMV ) Netherlands start role chronic ventilatory support end-stage COPD . Theoretically , might effective : 1. reset respiratory centre may reduce daytime PaCO2 ; 2. well internal milieu ( pH , PaO2 , PaCO2 ) may improve peripheral muscle function ; 3. rest respiratory muscle night may increase daytime strength endurance ; 4. reduction number nocturnal arousal may improve quality sleep . Nevertheless , none mechanism proven currently evidence noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) give stable patient COPD . While several randomise control trial ( RCT â€™ ) NIPPV publish different outcome , recent meta-analysis show beneficial effect blood gas , lung function , respiratory muscle function walk distance . In contrast several uncontrolled study show clear benefit NIPPV gas-exchange , dyspnoea quality life . Possible reason conflict outcome difference : 1. selection patient , 2. adequacy ventilatory support , 3. length ventilatory support . Interestingly , seem study positive outcome include mainly patient hypercapnia , suggest important selection criterion . The hypothesis long term NIPPV hypercapnic patient COPD may improve effect rehabilitation home regard health status , ADL function , dyspnoea exercise tolerance . Secondly , like elucidate exact mechanism NIPPV might effective group patient . Comparison : patient receive noninvasive ventilation night follow pulmonary rehabilitation program patient follow rehabilitation program without receive noninvasive ventilation .</detailed_description>
