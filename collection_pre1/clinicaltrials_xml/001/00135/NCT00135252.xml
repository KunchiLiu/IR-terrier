	<brief_summary>Infants &lt; 1500 gram birth weight require &gt; 1 week mechanical ventilation ( breathe machine ) CPAP [ continuous positive airway pressure ] ( oxygen high flow nose ) may prolong oxygen requirement . The nasal cannula ( oxygen nose low flow ) commonly use method oxygen administration , despite lack data regard safety efficacy . Low birth weight infant vulnerable obstruction secretion blood , well presence nasal cannula . Partially obstruct nostril greatly increase work breathing . Additional potential adverse effect include increase need suction , increase risk systemic infection , inadvertent positive end expiratory pressure ( CPAP ) . No study conduct evaluate efficacy nasal cannula compare oxygen hood ( plastic `` hood '' place infant 's head provide oxygen ) gas exchange infection . Among infant require supplemental oxygen ( either nasal cannula oxygen hood ) clinical indication , objective investigator hope accomplish randomize blind ( investigator ) trial : Aim 1 : To determine short-term effect different flow oxygen nasal cannula transcutaneous PCO2 ( PTCO2 ) . Aim 2 : To determine , optimal flow establish Aim 1 , effect prolong ( one week ) use nasal cannula compare oxygen hood PTCO2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Question : Among low birth weight infant supplemental oxygen requirement , modification flow ( L/min ) nasal cannula gas alter level transcutaneous PCO2 short term ( 30 minute ) long term ( one week ) ? Objectives : Aim 1 : To determine short-term effect different flow oxygen nasal cannula transcutaneous PCO2 . Aim 2 : To determine , optimal flow establish Aim 1 , effect prolong ( one week ) use nasal cannula compare oxygen hood transcutaneous PCO2 . Randomization Method : Following informed consent , stratify base weight ( &lt; 1250 gram &gt; 1250 gram ) , well oxygen delivery requirement ( NCPAP/mechanical ventilation ) time enrollment . Randomization occur soon possible follow eligibility criterion meet . All enrol infant randomize one two different sequence evaluation short-term effect gas flow rate transcutaneous PCO2 ( Aim 1 ) . Enrolled infant randomly assign numbered opaque envelope contain card indicates assign treatment order ( block method use random number table individual involve care infant ) ( one two group sequence ) . Then , infant meet eligibility criterion outline Aim 2 randomize either oxygen hood ideal nasal cannula flow period one week , number opaque envelope contain card indicates assign treatment group . Intervention : In Aim 1 study , enrol infant randomly assign sequence either : oxygen hood , follow 1 L/min NC , ½ L/min NC , ¼ L/min NC , 1/8 L/min NC , oxygen hood , OR oxygen hood follow 1/8 L/min NC , ¼ L/min NC , ½ L/min NC , 1L/min NC , oxygen hood . Infants remain flow minimum 30 minute 5 minute interval reading transcutaneous PCO2 , heart rate , respiratory rate . The `` optimal '' nasal cannula flow rate define low flow rate consistently maintain SaO2 &gt; 85 % FiO2≤ 0.5 without increase transcutaneous PCO2 5 mm Hg oxygen hood PCO2 . In Aim 2 study , infant randomize nasal cannula ( optimal flow rate determine Aim 1 ) oxygen hood period one week . At end one week transcutaneous PCO2 , heart rate , respiratory rate monitor total 30 minute 5 minute interval . Co-Interventions Feeding : To control feed related change functional residual capacity , standardize infant receive continuous feed 2 hour prior resume bolus feeds sooner 2 hour follow outcome assessment . Suctioning : As need secretion , otherwise schedule frequent 4 time /day . Methylxanthines : At discretion attend physician recommendation &lt; 1000 gram infant receive prophylactic methylxanthines [ per Cochrane Collaboration find RR 0.58 95 % CI ( 0.29,1.16 ) ] . Also request change make study period . Diuretics : At discretion attend physician , recommendation diuretic time enrollment , discontinue study period . Escalation Guidelines : Mechanical ventilation : Recommendations reintubation : transcutaneous PCO2 &gt; 70 pH &lt; 7.2 ; &gt; 2 apnea/bradycardia necessitate bag mask ventilation . NCPAP : Recommendations : may place NCPAP infant multiple apnea/bradycardia ( &gt; 6/day require moderate vigorous stimulation ) despite optimization airway . Nasal cannula : May increase nasal cannula flow change oxygen hood saturation &lt; 85 consistently 1 hour FiO2 1.0 . Baseline variable : On entry Aim 1 , baseline variable record include gender , gestational age , birth weight , post-natal age , diuretic use , methylxanthine use , oxygen delivery requirement ( NCPAP , mechanical ventilation ) , duration mechanical ventilation . Aim 1 Outcome Variables : During Aim 1 determine `` optimal '' nasal cannula flow rate , define low flow rate consistently maintain SaO2 &gt; 85 % FiO2 &lt; 0.5 without increase transcutaneous PCO2 5 mmHg oxygen hood PCO2 . Also plan analyze average heart rate , respiratory rate . Aim 2 Outcome Variables : During Aim 2 , baseline variable entry include list Aim 1 . At conclusion Aim 2 , record necessity return NCPAP mechanical ventilation ; addition methylxanthine diuretic steroid necessary ; sepsis ( define positive blood culture/ treat antibiotic &gt; 5 day ) occur . Assessment Methods : Aim 1 outcome : The assessment association oxygen flow transcutaneous PCO2 order determine ideal nasal cannula flow accomplish graphing average transcutaneous PCO2 measurement obtain L/min flow . Each enrol patient transcutaneous PCO2 record every five minute remain flow oxygen thirty minute . Then average 6 transcutaneous PCO2 reading calculate flow rate . All record data average plot graph individual patient . From graph flow minimal change PCO2 obtain ideal flow patient . Aim 2 Outcome : The assessment change PCO2 end one week among two treatment group accomplish statistical analysis . At conclusion one week therapy assign arm therapy transcutaneous recording PCO2 period thirty minute five minute interval make . These recording compare baseline recording make Aim 1 . Blinding : The study clinician bedside nurse difficult blind intervention group . The individual recording transcutaneous PCO2 blind flow nasal cannula , outcome assessment Aim 1 . A second individual blind treatment assignment outcome assessment recording Aim 2 . Sample Size : In order demonstrate difference large one standard deviation , require sample size 44 . This calculation base : Standard Deviation : No data available predict standard deviation Alpha 0.05 , Beta =1-0.9= 0.1 ; use two side t-test group need 22 patient . Stopping Rules : Due small size study , interim analysis . Hypoxia respiratory distress associate poor outcome . Any patient develop significant respiratory distress , outline reintubation NCPAP recommendation , take NC oxygen hood place back assigned arm treatment attend physician determines infant clinically able . Given small study size low expectation severe adverse event , plan schedule formal DSMB process . Infants study monitor serious adverse event study relate ( e.g . respiratory distress necessitate escalation care ) . If 6 event occur course study , independent ad hoc DSMB ( include least one neonatologist one biostatistician ) convene make judgment regard continuation trial . Analysis Plan : The follow analysis plan design allow every randomized infant include intention treat analysis , regardless whether require reintubation , NCPAP . All infant assign rank baseline outcome ( 1 week ) follow : - Infants oxygen deliver nasal cannula oxygen hood rank accord delta ( change ) transcutaneous PCO2 , subgroup receive low rank . - Infants oxygen hood require nasal cannula infant nasal cannula require high flow assign high rank infant remain oxygen hood require increase flow nasal cannula . - Infants require NCPAP mechanical ventilation assign high rank . A rank sum test conduct compare two group .</detailed_description>
