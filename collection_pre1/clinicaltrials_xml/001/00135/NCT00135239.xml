	<brief_title>Study Care Versus Usual Care Acute Mechanical Lower Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To determine evidence-based care ( EBC ) effective usual care ( UC ) improve functional status patient acute mechanical low back pain . Our secondary objective determine EBC effective improve patient quality life time return work . Research Methodology : Design : This two arm , parallel design , randomize trial . Eligibility : Inclusion criterion resident British Columbia mechanical low back pain ( Quebec Task Force Spinal Disorders Classification categories 1 2 ) four week duration . Recruitment : All study patient recruit patient population currently refer assessment Combined Neurosurgical Orthopaedic Spine Program ( CNOSP ) outpatient clinic ( OPC ) . Randomisation : Patients randomize receive treatment either CNOSP outpatient clinic ( EBC ) family physician ( UC ) . Intervention : All study patient assess initially physician CNOSP outpatient clinic confirm meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study . Patients receive EBC intervention receive re-assurance , advice avoid passive treatment , acetominophen ( except contraindicate ) period 2-4 week , four week course lumbar spine spinal manipulative therapy administer CNOSP Chiropractor advice return work capacity within eight week follow start treatment . Patients randomized UC treatment arm undergo treatment ( ) recommend family physician . Outcomes Interest : Primary Outcome : Our primary outcome interest difference mean change functional improvement sixteen week start treatment , define change modify Roland Disability ( RDQ ) score , EBC UC patient group . Secondary Outcomes : Secondary outcome interest difference mean change functional improvement eight week twenty-four week start treatment defined change modify Roland Disability ( RDQ ) score , difference time return work difference 'Bodily Pain 'Physical Functioning ' domain SF-36 questionnaire , EBC UC patient group . Statistical Analysis : The RDQ score two group compare use Student 's T Test . Analysis co-variance use necessary adjust difference baseline functional status use baseline RDQ score co-variate . Time return work compare use Kaplan Meier survival analysis . A group comparison survival perform use log-rank test . SF 36 score normalize Bodily Pain '' Physical Functioning scale compare EBC UC group , use unpaired t-test necessary , analysis covariance . Estimated sample size : 88 subject require base two-sided independent T Test . Power + 0.80 , alpha + 0.05 , mean difference + 3 point , standard deviation + 4.4 allow 25 % loss follow-up . Non-Scientific Summary : The common work-related injury British Columbia every year lower back injury . The many different treatment option available worker back injury often lead confusion frustration . New back pain research show combination treatment helpful , also show many injured worker British Columbia treatment make readily available . This research study design accurately determine whether provide patient suffer acute back injuries combination recommend treatment , improve function , quality life return work . Relevance : - Why study high priority WCB funding ? Lower back injury remain single common category claim loss make injured worker . A recent study show majority worker British Columbia low back injury receive treatment inconsistent internationally develop , evidence-based clinical practice guideline . In addition , preliminary research study show many aspect patient recovery lower back injury enhance use guideline-recommended treatment compare guideline discordant treatment . The propose study accurately determine value treat low back-injured patient combination evidence-based treatment . In addition , result study potential significantly impact many issue key importance WCB include improve quality life patient acute low back injury , reduce use inappropriate treatment may promote disability reduce cost associated treatment patient . - What impact research outcome BC workplace ? The outcome research study help clarify uncertainty currently exist respect treatment combination treatment , helpful low back-injured worker . The result study potential greatly improve treatment and/or rehabilitation patient currently receive British Columbia , therefore reduce disability associate work-related low back injury .</detailed_description>
