	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia one common complication pregnancy characterize high blood pressure protein urine . This cause problem second half pregnancy mother fetus . This study preeclampsia consist two part : 1 ) randomize , placebo control , multicenter clinical trial 10,000 low-risk nulliparous woman 9 16 week gestation 2 ) observational , cohort study 4,000 patient 9 12 week gestation also enrol trial . Subjects part receive either 1000 mg vitamin C 400 IU vitamin E match placebo daily . The purpose randomized , clinical trial find high dos vitamin C E reduce risk preeclampsia problem associated disease . The study also evaluate safety antioxidant therapy mother infant . Patients see monthly receive supply study drug , weight blood pressure record , urine protein measure , assess side effect . At two visit , blood urine collect . The observational , cohort study prospectively measure potential biochemical biophysical marker might predict preeclampsia . These patient additional procedure include uterine artery Doppler blood drawn complete blood count ( CBC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Randomized , Clinical Trial Antioxidants Prevent Preeclampsia : Preeclampsia lead cause maternal morbidity , well perinatal morbidity mortality . Once diagnosis establish , therapy delivery successful except prolong pregnancy minimally ( risk mother infant ) . Prevention effort reduce eliminate preeclampsia direct pathophysiology disorder prior clinically evident preeclampsia irreversible change occur . This double-masked , placebo-controlled trial 10,000 subject design evaluate effect antioxidant therapy prevent serious complication associate pregnancy-related hypertension low risk , nulliparous woman begin treatment 9-16 week gestation . The hypothesis test antioxidant therapy initiate prior 16 week gestation reduce frequency serious maternal infant complication associate pregnancy-related hypertension . After randomization , subject receive either 1000 mg vitamin C 400 IU vitamin E match placebo daily . They see monthly pill count assess side effect , weight , blood pressure , urine protein . Blood urine collect 24 32 week ' gestation . An Observational Cohort Study Predict Preeclampsia : A prospective , cohort study design complement randomize , control , trial ( RCT ) test various biochemical biophysical marker ability predict preeclampsia 4,000 woman enrol RCT 9 12 week gestation . These subject additional procedure include CBC uterine artery Doppler .</detailed_description>
