	<brief_title>Factors Predicting Efficacy Allergen Injection Immunotherapy Grass Pollen Hayfever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre , randomise , double-blind placebo control trial grass pollen injection immunotherapy ( Alutard SQ , ALK Abello , Denmark ) adult severe summer hayfever unresponsive antihistamine topical steroid . The main aim determine point dose regime grass pollen immunotherapy cause significant reduction late skin response allergen challenge . A weekly cluster regimen 2 injection per visit employ up-dosing phase , follow monthly maintenance injection 100,000 SQ unit . Twelve patient receive active treatment ( mean age 31 , 7 male ) whilst 6 give placebo ( mean age 37 , 2 male ) . The 24 hour skin response ( size swelling , ( mm ) ) intradermal allergen challenge ( 0.1 , 1 , 10 BU ) determine alternate week 8 week up-dosing phase monthly 6 month 3 monthly 11-13 month follow initiation treatment . Results : At end up-dosing phase ( approximately 8 week ) significant reduction size late phase response evident three intradermal dos ( p=0.02 0.1 &amp; 1 BU p=0.04 10 BU ) . This reduction sustain throughout maintenance phase ( p=0.04 0.1 BU 0.01 1 &amp; 10BU ) . Conclusion : The up-dosing phase grass pollen immunotherapy alone sufficient dampen late skin response allergen challenge . Whether may predictive clinical response immunotherapy remain determined .</detailed_description>
