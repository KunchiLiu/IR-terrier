	<brief_summary>Patients ask take part research study multiple myeloma relapse ( come back ) , refractory ( unaffected ) , initial therapy . For patient relapsed refractory therapy , agree upon standard treatment . Treatment option include chemotherapy , patient , bone marrow transplant . None available treatment curative investigator continually look effective treatment . This study involve treatment new combination standard drug : VELCADE , Doxil , Dexamethasone . Preliminary result study use combination VELCADE Doxil show high response rate ( disease reduction ) . Two study show addition Dexamethasone VELCADE patient respond VELCADE alone improve response rate . The propose combination three drug may improve efficacy response . VELCADE approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use multiple myeloma . Doxil approve use multiple myeloma approve drug use patient cancer . Several publish clinical trial provide evidence Doxil active agent multiple myeloma use treatment combination multiple myeloma general practice . Dexamethasone approve use multiple myeloma . The combination three drug experimental ( FDA approve ) . The goal study determine new combination therapy VELCADE , Doxil Dexamethasone effective treatment , also determine side effect occur combination treatment give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Therapy With VELCADE , Doxil , Dexamethasone ( VDd ) Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma remain non-curable disease . Combination therapies VAD effective , partial response rate ~40-60 % range tolerable toxicity . A recent study show substitute Doxil Doxorubicin regimen similar VAD ( DVd ) result improved toxicity profile similar efficacy . The active agent VAD ( presumably DVd ) Doxorubicin ( Doxil ) Dexamethasone , Vincristine add little , efficacy regimen ( ) . One new active agent multiple myeloma VELCADE ( bortezomib , formerly know VELCADE ) . This molecule novel mechanism action specifically inhibiting proteasome . A recently report Phase II trial show VELCADE single agent induce least minimal response ( i.e . &gt; 25 % reduction monoclonal protein ) 35 % patient least stabilization disease 59 % patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma use strict SWOG criterion . An additional 18 % respond Dexamethasone add VELCADE . Pre-clinical observation show addition VELCADE chemotherapeutic agent , doxorubicin , enhance cytotoxicity multiple myeloma cell . Preliminary result Phase I study combination VELCADE Doxil show 60 % response rate ( i.e . &gt; partial response ) acceptable toxicity . In study propose combine three active agent , i.e . Doxil , Dexamethasone ( two active agent DVd ) , VELCADE . The ultimate goal show combination drug efficacious VAD VELCADE either Dexamethasone Doxil without additional toxicity .</detailed_description>
