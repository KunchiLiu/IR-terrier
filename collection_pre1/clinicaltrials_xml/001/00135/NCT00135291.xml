	<brief_title>Effect Leukoreduced Blood Transfusions Infection Following Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many severely injured patient survive initial resuscitation suffer late sequela nosocomial infection multiple organ failure . The depth hemorrhagic shock severity anatomic injury clearly associate adverse outcome , however clear evidence suggest event resuscitation phase also play important role pathogenesis sequela . Specifically , substantial clinical experimental evidence implicate blood transfusion transfusion allogeneic passenger leukocyte immune dysregulation characteristic post-injury state . This immune dysregulation manifest two front : uncontrolled inflammatory response lead organ dysfunction state immunoparalysis , lead development nosocomial infection . Allogeneic passenger leukocyte implicate alteration non-specific specific immunity underlie state alter immunoresponsiveness . The importance allogeneic leukocytes phenomena suggests strategy design limit exposure patient cell may reduce incidence post-injury sequela . Pre-storage leukoreduction , whereby donate blood pass leukocyte filter prior storage ultimate transfusion one strategy . This strategy remain center national debate policy universal leukoreduction efficacy unproven cost undisputed . Study Objectives : - To evaluate whether clinically relevant difference rate infection severity multiple organ failure critically injured trauma patient receive leukoreduced blood product compare receive standard allogeneic blood product . - To assess T-cell responsiveness dominant CD4 lymphocyte subset measure T-lymphocyte IL-2 receptor expression cytokine profile , respectively , critically injured subject transfuse leukoreduced blood product compare subject receive standard allogeneic blood product . - To assess activational state peripheral blood monocyte neutrophil critically injured trauma patient receive leukoreduced blood product compare subject receive standard allogeneic blood product . - To evaluate whether clinically relevant difference rate acute lung injury ( ALI ) circulate marker ALI patient receive leukoreduced versus standard allogeneic blood product . - To evaluate rate microchimerism receive leukoreduced versus standard allogeneic transfusion</detailed_description>
