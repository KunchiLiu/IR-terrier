	<brief_summary>We aim investigate effectiveness safety nitrous oxide ( N2O ) anaesthesia . Hypothesis In patient undergo anaesthesia major surgery , avoidance N2O reduce hospital length stay compare otherwise identically manage surgical patient receive N2O component anaesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ENIGMA - Evaluation Nitrous Oxide In Gas Mixture Anaesthesia : Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There compel reason question routine use nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , also know `` laugh gas '' . Despite first anaesthetic drug introduce , still widely use , sufficient doubt risk-benefit profile . There strong evidence N2O major risk factor postoperative nausea vomit . It clear ( even ) brief exposure N2O impair methionine synthetase , enzyme require DNA production , red white blood cell formation . Tissue hypoxia may common . These adverse effect enhance `` sick '' patient ( ie . high risk , increase hospital length stay healthcare expenditure ) , likely longer surgery . The extent wound infection cardiac morbidity associate N2O know . Large outcome trial data lacking . When consider widespread use 90 % surgery around world , small difference outcome would major implication healthcare delivery . A large randomise control trial necessary answer question . We recruit 2000 patient 25 centre around world ( mostly Australasia ) , undergo major surgery .</detailed_description>
