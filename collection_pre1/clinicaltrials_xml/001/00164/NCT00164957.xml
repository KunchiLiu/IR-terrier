	<brief_summary>Background : Tube feed find cause aspiration pneumonia . Continuous pump feed slow rate compare bolus feed may less associated aspiration pneumonia . Methods : Randomized control trial Subjects : Patients expect remain tube feed 4 week Outcomes : 1 ) pneumonia , 2 ) mortality</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Continuous Versus Enteral Pump Feeding Aspiration Tube Fed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject randomize 2 group random number generate computer programme : intermittent bolus feed versus continuous feed via delivery pump . Baseline Assessment : Clinical detail include background medical diagnosis , indication enteral feeding , functional status baseline CXR finding record . Tube Feeding Regime : The choice feed formula feeding volume guide 2 dietitian collaborate study . Giving set continuous pump feed change everyday . Pump feed define delivery rate &lt; 60ml/hr . In order avoid interfere rehabilitative activity , pump feed discontinue eight hour day . Bolus feed define 400ml/hr , 4 5 time per day . All subject review monitor complication arise enteral feeding . Free pump feed set provide extra 2 week pump feed group subject discharge end trial . All subject discharge prior end trial contact regularly research assistant completion outcome reach . Outcome Pneumonia diagnose presence 2 major clinical sign : increase sputum production pneumonic change CXR ( accord radiologist report ) , presence one major sign 2 follow minor clinical sign : raise depressed white cell count , hypoxia room air ( PaO2 &lt; 92 % ) body temperature great 38 % . When criterion pneumonia fulfil , trial terminate . All subject follow four week outcome reach ( i.e . pneumonia ) . Mode tube feed discharge decide attend physician , patient family member .</detailed_description>
