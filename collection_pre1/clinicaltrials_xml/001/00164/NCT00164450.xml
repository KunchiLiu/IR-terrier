	<brief_title>TBTC Study 26 PK : Rifapentine Pharmacokinetics Children During Treatment Latent TB Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics rifapentine study adult , adolescent ( age 12-15 year ) , patient hepatic dysfunction HIV infection . However , publish data efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics rifapentine child . This lack data preclude till enrollment child less 12 year old TBTC Study 26 , study effectiveness tolerability weekly rifapentine/isoniazid three month versus daily isoniazid nine month treatment latent tuberculosis infection , phase 3 treatment trial enroll 8000 person latent tuberculosis infection . A recently complete initial evaluation rifapentine pharmacokinetics among child receive single dose rifapentine demonstrate significantly low exposure rifapentine among child compare adult , child give weight-based dos choose comparable 600 mg oral dose adult . This reduced exposure suggest child require high weight-based dos adult model construct estimate rifapentine dos child would result exposure similar 900 mg dose use adult Study 26 . Study 26 amend include child age 2-11 base initial single-dose study pharmacokinetic modeling . The purpose Study 26PK evaluate adequacy dose choose young child enrol Study 26 . Briefly , study aim : - determine whether rifapentine exposure equivalent young child receive weight-based dosing adult receive 900 mg. - correlate rifapentine exposure toxicity young child - validate accuracy weight-based dosing child - determine rifapentine bioavailability child - determine association adult polymorphisms MDR1 genotype rifapentine exposure - correlate isoniazid concentration adult acetylator status</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Enrolled TBTC Study 26 randomize treatment weekly isoniazid rifapentine : Child age 2 less 12 year informed consent guardian assent ( applicable ) obtain . Adult great age 18 informed consent obtain . 2 . Willingness undergo blood phlebotomy 24 hour follow dose isoniazid rifapentine receive least three onceweekly dos rifapentine plus isoniazid . If result contact investigation , parent child enrol Study 26 , may coenrolled pharmacokinetic substudy adult serve control child . Preference give biologic parent gender . If eligible biologic parent available study , next adult gender TBTC site , substudy eligible , serve adult control .</criteria>
