	<brief_summary>Tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) , form movement disorder , remain problem patient receive antipsychotic medication . Increasing evidence suggest TD may result antipsychotic-induced dysfunction striatal cholinergic neuron . To test whether cholinesterase inhibitor compensate diminish cholinergic activity underlie TD , conduct 30-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study galantamine 36 patient TD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) infrequent important complication treatment antipsychotic medication . Although new antipsychotic may less likely cause TD , still occur among mentally ill patient previously treat typical antipsychotic . Although usually mild , TD may troublesome patient . There proven curative suppressive treatment effective patient . Suppressive treatment cholinergic agent derive hypothesized balance dopaminergic cholinergic neurotransmission extrapyramidal system . Although previous trial cholinergic precursor unsuccessful treat TD , effect central cholinergic neurotransmission remain uncertain view evidence damage striatal cholinergic neuron patient TD . In contrast , recent development cholinesterase inhibitor effective modifying central cholinergic deficit Alzheimer â€™ disease , prompt u investigate therapeutic effect galantamine patient TD . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES : We propose complete randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial 36 patient test ; ( 1 ) whether galantamine pharmacologically active suppress TD ; ( 2 ) whether dos 8-24 mg/day sufficient improvement ; ( 3 ) whether significant side effect patient . METHODS : Thirty-six patient abnormal involuntary movement meet research criterion TD , stable dos psychotropic medication , randomize receive galantamine alternate placebo addition standard medication . After 2 baseline measurement , patient undergo 12-week treatment period galantamine placebo 4-week washout period treatment . Patients evaluate every 2 week throughout study , use standardize rating scale TD ( AIMS ) extrapyramidal side effect ( SIMPSON , BARNES . During active treatment period , patient receive galantamine 4 mg BID 4 week follow 8 mg BID 4 week , 12 mg BID additional 4 week . Placebo-galantamine difference examine repeated measure analysis covariance two-period crossover design .</detailed_description>
