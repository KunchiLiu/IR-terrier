	<detailed_description>Background Objectives : Herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) primary cause genital ulcer one prevalent sexually transmit infection ( STI ) worldwide . HSV-2 recognize risk factor HIV multiple study . A substantial shift aetiology genital ulcer disease ( GUD ) towards genital herpes note many country Africa , especially mature HIV epidemic . Some country guide predominance HSV-2 aetiology GUD country , change syndromic guideline include acyclovir part treatment GUD . Little data available support decision term effect clinical course cost-effectiveness . Yet , substantial investment would need poor country add acyclovir essential drug list . Studies determine appropriateness episodic acyclovir therapy HSV-2 developing world need . Episodic therapy acyclovir treatment modality HIV-prevention strategy appeal , term cost sustainability . However , clear impact field condition would delay symptom recognition treatment initiation , whether condition could optimize patient education . We propose conduct randomize placebo-controlled trial effect HSV-2 episodic therapy symptomatic herpes HIV shed genital ulcer . This study help answer question acyclovir therapy herpes add syndromic management genital ulcer disease . Acyclovir acceptable profile widespread STI treatment relatively inexpensive well-tolerated . Given HSV-2 lead cause GUD develop world , approach could great public health importance , provide safe , acceptable , cost-effective method treat genital ulcer disease potentially reduce HIV transmission . If acyclovir therapy reduces HIV shed , incorporation syndromic management would provide effective way scale public health intervention . Methods : We plan individually randomize double blind placebo-control trial WHO US CDC recommend dose 3-times daily acyclovir 5-day treatment course . The trial conduct two primary health care clinic Johannesburg , South Africa . A total 600 men present clinic GUD enrol study . Consenting participant randomize receive either acyclovir plus syndromic management placebo plus syndromic management . Syndromic management genital ulcer disease consist one dose antibiotic cover syphilis chancroid . Participants follow month ; follow-up visit duration ulcer , ulcer number size evaluate ulcer , blood semen sample collect test HIV RNA viral load among HIV-positives HSV-2 shedding . Timeline : Duration project 2 year Expected Outcomes : The main outcome study evaluation impact acyclovir therapy ulcer heal . We also measure impact acyclovir therapy HIV HSV-2 viral load genital ulcer HIV viral load semen .</detailed_description>
