	<brief_title>A Study Comparing High Dose Omeprazole Infusion Against Scheduled Second Endoscopy Bleeding Peptic Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We previously perform prospective randomize controlled trial effect schedule second endoscopy upon peptic ulcer rebleeding . We find rate recurrent bleed significantly reduce 13.8 % 5 % schedule second endoscopy appropriate therapy perform within 24 hour initial hemostasis . When look study literature employ proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) infusion primary endoscopic therapy , find also significant reduction rate rebleeding , number operation perform transfusion requirement . Controversy exist regard optimal strategy minimize recurrent peptic ulcer bleed successful endoscopic hemostasis . A recent cost-effective analysis various strategy show selective schedule second endoscopy strategy probably effective least expensive prevent recurrent peptic ulcer bleed . We conduct randomized trial cost-effectiveness use omeprazole infusion v schedule second endoscopy management bleed peptic ulcer .</detailed_description>
