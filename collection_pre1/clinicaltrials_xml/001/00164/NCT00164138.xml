	<brief_title>Prevalence Treatment Urinary Incontinence Women With Cystic Fibrosis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project undertaken two phase : Phase 1 involve mail screen questionnaire survey sample 50-60 woman CF 50-60 woman COPD investigate prevalence incontinence population . For subject require assistance independent physiotherapist available assist completion questionnaire telephone . Return stamp address envelope provide subject initial mail-out . The following type incontinence investigate : stress incontinence , urge incontinence , faecal incontinence , faecal urgency , nocturnal enuresis , void dysfunction , insensible urine loss , defaecation difficulty , know prolapse , childhood enuresis . Phase 2 assessment interventional study . Subjects measure treatment intervention follow three month use follow validated outcome measure : - Symptoms measure : 3-day frequency-volume chart , 24-hour pad weigh test , 7-day accident diary , quality life measure ( King 's Health Questionnaire ) . - Pelvic floor muscle function : - Electromyographic study ( EMG ) pelvic floor muscle use intravaginal electrode - Transabdominal diagnostic ultrasound - Adherence program : self report diary . Subjects assess pelvic floor muscle activity attend School Physiotherapy Movement Laboratory undertake follow test : 1 . A 7-day accident diary 2 . King 's Health Questionnaire 3 . Severity index score 4 . ICIQ SF score 5 . Ultra-sound examination movement pelvic floor muscle 6 . EMG measurement pelvic floor muscle activity . Ultrasound measurement use Acoustic Imaging Performa ultrasound unit ( Dornier , Medtech , USA ) accompany software use image measurement . The aim obtain image show great degree displacement pelvic floor muscle activity . The mean value three record measurement use statistical analysis follow activity : 20 second maximum effort endurance hold , 3 deep cough , 3 huff . EMG pelvic floor activity measure use intravaginal electrode rest , follow brief maximum voluntary contraction 1 second sustain maximum voluntary contraction 20 second determine strength time pelvic floor muscle activity subject chronic cough compare healthy control . In order investigate pelvic floor muscle activity force expiration cough EMG record record thoracic movement huff cough precede inspiration . The effect physiotherapeutic intervention three-month period incontinence investigate . All subject refer treatment one 9 select continence physiotherapist work continence clinic woman 's health practice provide state art treatment conveniently locate subject . Treatment comprise standard physiotherapy intervention 5 treatment within 3-months period customise basis assessment . Details treatment subsequently examine broad consistency . Pelvic floor muscle training , biofeedback , electrotherapy bladder training include treatment individually indicated.. A assessment occur immediately post-treatment program follow follow-up assessment 3-months completion treatment program . Results study provide medical practitioner physiotherapist .</detailed_description>
