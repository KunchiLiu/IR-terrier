	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Interferon Ribavirin Treatment Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Research Plan : Chronic HCV infection often follow progressive course many year , ultimately result cirrhosis need liver transplantation hepatocellular carcinoma . The decision treat patient chronic hepatitis C infection base upon several factor include natural history stage disease efficacy adverse effect relate therapy . As general rule patient consider treatment histologic virologic evidence chronic infection ( i.e. , HCV RNA detectable serum ) elevate serum ALT ( 1 ) . Combination treatment Interferon Ribavirin currently best available treatment chronic HCV infection . However , response therapy suboptimal several side effect . Side effect see therapy patient Interferon Ribavirin include flu-like symptom mostly due interferon , cytopenias haemolysis induce Ribavirin . Psychiatric change due interferon , occur 50 % thyroid abnormality require therapy occur 1 5 % treated interferon . Autoimmune disease retinal haemorrhage also report . In addition , combination therapy associate significant risk patient renal dysfunction , cardiac disease haemolytic anaemia treatment may associate anaemia . Patients depress suicidal also exclude ( 2 ) . To point little DNA microarray work do do HCV . However , work do interesting show promise . In study compare Hepatitis B ( HBV ) Hepatitis C , HBV infection find express gene predominantly involve inflammation . In contrast , HCV infection anti-inflammatory gene find express ( 3 ) . In another study HCV associate cirrhosis show characterized proinflammatory , pro-fibrotic proapoptotic gene expression profile ( 4 ) . The progression HCV infection gene expression analysis liver biopsy acutely infect chimpanzee develop persistent infection , transient viral clearance , sustain clearance examine . Transient sustain viral clearance uniquely associate induction IFN-gamma-induced gene gene involve antigen process presentation adaptive immune response . The study reveal genome-wide transcriptional change reflect establishment , spread , control infection , reveal potentially unique antiviral program associate clearance HCV infection ( 5 ) . In-vitro study human cell line Huh7 show exposure cell Interferon 50 gene up-regulated least twofold control clone , whereas induction 9 50 gene significantly reduce Huh7 clone express NS5A . Interferon-alpha activity find inhibited HCV protein NS5A . The strong effect NS5A Interferon response observe OAS-p69 gene reduce expression . In addition , Huh7 cell express NS5A show up-regulation interleukin-8 proinflammatory cytokine . As result study postulate mechanism NS5A mediate interferon resistance ( 6 ) . In recent study microarray gene profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell hepatitis C patient treat Interferon-alpha perform . 88 gene directly relate function immune cell up-regulated , include gene involve antigen process presentation , T-cell activation , lymphocyte trafficking , effector function , suggest Interferon-alpha up-regulates multiple gene involve different aspect immune response enhance immunity hepatitis C virus ( 7 ) . Currently , treatment HCV still significant non-responder rate associate side effect limit many individual receive treatment . Already molecular profile DNA microarrays identify potential genetic target may role pathogenesis HCV-associated hepatitis importantly possible target role response Interferon treatment . The work propose hope build body knowledge may lead improved treatment modality HCV . Methods/Experimental Design : Approval Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee obtain subject recruit via Alfred Hospital 's Hepatitis Clinics . Informed consent study obtain purpose explain verbally via plain English statement . Informed consent also include consent liver biopsy . Initially , pilot study undertaken one subject recruit experimental control arm study . Once result pilot study analyse study expand encompass great number individual . Liver biopsy perform follow group . 1 . HCV positive patient prior commencement end treatment either standard pegylated Interferon plus Ribavirin . This group subdivide responder non-responders treatment . Core liver biopsy ultra-sound guidance already routinely perform group prior commencement treatment . For purpose study non-responders combination therapy individual remain HCV-RNA positive end treatment . 2 . Control population consist patient undergo laparotomy disease involve liver . These biopsy would obtain time surgery . Enough liver tissue ( approximately 1-2 mg ) obtain isolate messenger RNA ( mRNA ) oligo dT chromatography . Once isolated mRNA reverse transcribe complementary DNA ( cDNA ) . This cDNA label fluorescent reporter molecule . Hybridization label liver cDNA occur DNA microarray . It envisage microarray commercially obtain consist human cDNA . There enough DNA microarray two lot label liver cDNA different fluorescent marker ( i.e . red green ) hybridize array time without interference . The following hybridization would set . Reporter molecule 1 : HCV +ve group . cDNA Reporter molecule 2 : HCV -ve group . cDNA Hybridization 1 Responder Rx . Before Rx Control cDNA Hybridization 2 Responder Rx . After Rx Control cDNA Hybridization 3 Non responder Rx . Before Rx Control cDNA Hybridization 4 Non responder Rx . After Rx Control cDNA Rx = treatment . The hybridized array scan commercially available software package use help interpretation result ( 8 ) . Genes group gene particular interest include : 1 . Pro-inflammatory response gene - Th-1 cytokine Gamma Interferon ( IFN ) , Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Tumour Necrosis Factor-beta ( TNF-ÃŸ ) . Th1 cytokines promote production opsonize antibody ( e.g. , IgG1 ) induction cellular cytotoxicity macrophage activation . Th1 responses prominent defence pathogen replicate intracellularly . - Tumour Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) TNF receptor family molecules strongly pro-inflammatory involve immune regulation . - Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) key cytokine protect host viral microbial infection . It link innate acquire arm immune system . - Interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) show act chemoattractant . 2 . Genes involve pro-fibrotic response . - Transforming growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) cause fibroblast proliferation . - Procollagen I II . - Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) PDGF beta receptor over-expression link development fibrotic disease well cancer atherosclerosis . - Matrix metalloproteinases play pivotal role angiogenesis role tumorigenesis . - Fibroblast Growth Factor . - Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) know angiogenic property . - Connective tissue growth factor stimulate collagen production . In addition , novel gene previously unidentified , differential expression look characterize . References relevant project ( literature search ) 1 . Chopra , S.
