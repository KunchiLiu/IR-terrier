	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate efficacy Imipramine , tricyclic antidepressant , treatment functional dyspepsia . This double blind randomise placebo control trial consecutive patient diagnosis functional dyspepsia study . After exclusion organic cause dyspepsia endoscopy , patient randomly assign either imipramine placebo . All patient enter additional 4 week drug withdrawal phase initial 12 week study drug treatment . They evaluate treatment response , define satisfactory relief dyspeptic symptom end 12-week treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Imipramine Treatment Refractory Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional dyspepsia heterogeneous disorder consist variety upper gastrointestinal symptom postprandial fullness , early satiety , pain , bloating , belching , nausea . The pathophysiology functional dyspepsia fully understood correlation propose mechanisms clinical characteristic treatment response poor . Owing poor understanding mechanism , treatment functional dyspepsia far satisfactory . There numerous modality medical treatment report effective result conflict . Large well-controlled study functional dyspepsia show proton pump inhibitor therapeutic gain 10 % -15 % good placebo patient functional dyspepsia . However , positive effect restrict patient reflux-like dyspepsia , subgroup actually longer consider belong functional dyspepsia . Prokinetic agent another class drug widely use functional dyspepsia . Although recent review suggest prokinetics effective placebo , trial flaw significant heterogeneity among study . Tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) another important class drug commonly use various functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGID ) chronic pain disorder . The effectiveness TCA FGID support meta-analysis , report improvement global GI symptom placebo highly significant . The mechanism TCA treatment FGID poorly understand therapeutic effect evident even low dose , suggest independent anti-depressive action . To date , clinical trial TCA treatment FD sufficient sample size well-defined clinical endpoint still lack . So objective study evaluate efficacy imipramine , tricyclic antidepressant , treatment functional dyspepsia .</detailed_description>
