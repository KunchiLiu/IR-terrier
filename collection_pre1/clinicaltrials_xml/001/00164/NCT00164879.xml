	<brief_title>Endolaparoscopic Versus Immediate Surgery Obstructing Colorectal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient present obstruct left-sided colorectal cancer , emergency surgery carry significant morbidity mortality . Traditionally , patient would receive stag operation ( Hartmann 's procedure ) . Temporary stoma often require due edematous bowel wall preclude primary anastomosis result obstruction poor pre-morbid status . A second operation subsequently require restore bowel continuity . Apart expensive hospital cost stag operation , patient 's acceptance stoma poor social inconvenience associate stoma obvious . Thus , significant portion patient would suitable second operation due poor health advance disease bear stoma remainder life . Recently , self-expandable metal stent use success relieve acute obstruction patient obstruct left-sided colorectal cancer . Endoscopic stenting may help relieve obstruction , avoid emergency surgery , allow patient undergo one-stage elective surgery without necessity making stoma . We propose evaluate clinical benefit use self-expandable metal stent patient obstruct left-sided colorectal cancer follow elective laparoscopic resection compare use immediate emergency surgery .</detailed_description>
