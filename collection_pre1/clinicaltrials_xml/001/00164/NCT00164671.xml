	<detailed_description>Testing POWER project : A Neighborhood Intervention Trial PROTOCOL SUMMARY Sheana S. Bull , Ph.D . Principal Investigator Protocol # 02-978 Background The POWER project ( Prevention Options Women Equals Rights ) social marketing pilot project Targeting African American Latina woman age 15-25 promote “ mix ” female male condom conduct Denver , Colorado 2000 2001 . The result project show promise increase awareness use female condom use male condom ( Bull et al. , 2002 ) . Sixty-four percent woman follow-up study able identify one unique aspects POWER campaign . There significant increase awareness use female condom use male condom baseline follow-up . Being exposed POWER campaign significantly correlate heard ( r = 0.13 ) see ( r = 0.20 ) female condom , talk female condom frequently friend , family acquaintance ( r = 0.15 ) . Chi-square analysis use follow-up study data ( n=269 ) show woman expose campaign significantly great positive outcome expectancy toward female condom use ( p &lt; 0.10 ) talk female condom frequently people ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . The CDC report increase prevalence Chlamydia among woman Oakland/Alameda County , San Diego , Las Vegas Los Angeles increase rate gonorrhea Los Angeles Las Vegas ( Centers Disease Control Prevention , 2000 , 2002 ) . National data teen birth indicate teen birth decline , number birth woman age 20-24 increase birth unmarried woman . With advent female condom efficacious female control barrier method STD/HIV pregnancy prevention early 1990 ’ ( Bounds , 1997 ; Farr , Gabelnick , Sturgen , &amp; Dorflinger , 1994 ; Fontanet et al. , 1998 ; McCabe , Golub S. , &amp; Lee , 1997 ; Soper et al. , 1993 ; Trussell , Sturgen , Strickler , &amp; Dominik , 1994 ) , woman risk condition give great range choice control fertility prevent disease . Social marketing utilizes marketing advertising concept , integrate social science theory development behavior promotion campaign target specific subgroup . Such target key element social marketing approach . Social marketing approach show effective change blood cholesterol level ( Lefebvre , Lasater , Carleton , &amp; Peterson , 1987 ) , smoke behavior ( Kotler &amp; Roberto , 1989 ) , woman ’ child ’ health ( Hornick , 1991 ; Rasmuson , Seidel , &amp; Smith , 1988 ) . The intent project replicate POWER pilot campaign use randomize controlled trial neighborhood unit randomization analysis . We plan rigorously test effect POWER campaign woman ’ knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom prevention sexually transmit disease ( STD ) unintended pregnancy . We work 12 non-contiguous neighborhood four southwestern U.S. city ( four Oakland/Alameda County Los Angeles two San Diego Las Vegas ) . We complete baseline assessment 12 neighborhood document knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom . We randomly assign six neighborhood intervention status six neighborhood control status . We adapt campaign city , implement six intervention neighborhood nine month , complete follow-up assessment similar baseline assessment , add question regard exposure POWER campaign . Study partner include Dr. Sheana Bull research staff Colorado Health Outcomes Program ( COHO ) University Colorado Health Sciences Center , Educational Message Services ( EMS ) , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) . Methods In order achieve objective , utilize randomize controlled trial , pre-post test design neighborhood unit randomization analysis . To avoid introduction bias , COHO staff maintain responsibility research evaluation activity pre post test assessment . EMS implement maintain POWER social marketing campaign six intervention neighborhood . CDC serve technical advisor project . COHO first identify “ high risk ” neighborhood study city high US average rate ( define CDC , 2000 ) Chlamydia Gonorrhea combine high concentration African American Latina resident age 15-25 . We approach contact health department community organization city enlist help implement venue-based method sample hard-to-reach population ( process describe recruit method selection study population section ) . We use method recruit participant cross-sectional , baseline study document knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom . We randomly assign six neighborhood intervention status six neighborhood control status . We adapt campaign city , implement six intervention neighborhood nine month , complete follow-up assessment similar baseline assessment , add question regard exposure POWER campaign . Recruiting method Participants recruit select study neighborhood baseline follow-up study use venue-based application time-space sampling ( Muhib et al. , 2001 ) . The method involve first identify venue , place member target population may find , identify day time member target population likely find select venue . After venue day-time ( VDT ) unit identify , form sample frame , random sample VDTs select eligible member target population systematically sample within select VDTs . Throughout nine month baseline data collection period maintain sample frame VDTs recruit participant . Sampling frames update monthly , addition sporadically occur VDTs removal VDTs longer viable ( failed yield sufficient eligible participant infeasible due practical constraint ) . Each month , sample frame update , VDTs randomly select placed sampling event calendar . At time sample event , trained staff systematically approach ( e.g . every third woman appear 15 year old ) potential participant enter predefined sample area venue . Potential participant screen determine eligibility . Members target population meet eligibility criterion agree participate study complete inform consent prior enrollment . They self-administer study questionnaire , offer incentive value $ 10 time . This process venue-based sampling repeat follow-up data collection process . We revisit sample frame prior begin data collection remove longer viable VDTs add new VDTs . Subsequent follow-up sampling activity mirror conduct baseline . Consent procedure Training staff explain study process . Participants self-administer questionnaire . However , recruitment participant , explanation consent process study protocol , distribution incentive require trained staff . We core recruitment director hire COHO train study protocol COMIRB 101 . Any additional person hire assist data collection require attend IRB train area , take IRB 201 test online . Setting consent obtain . Consent obtain multiple community setting , e.g . bar , community organization , community business ( beauty salon , clothing store , grocery store ) , recreation center . The setting select random use procedure describe . Potential participant approach eligibility determine ask potential participant short eligibility question . Assessment subject comprehension autonomy . Staff ask participant explain study word prior hand questionnaire complete . Consent form copy make available participant . Staff ask participant sign two copy inform consent . They offer participant one copy keep one copy . Documentation consent process medical source document applicable study , study take place community rather medical setting . Intervention The POWER campaign implement six neighborhood choose random ( see method section ) ; two neighborhood Oakland/Alameda County , two Los Angeles one San Diego Las Vegas . The campaign last nine month , implement EMS . We 100 display point 25 site neighborhood . Some setting large others , require many display point ( e.g. , 10 ) others may small require few display point ( e.g. , two ) . Six control neighborhood ( choose random intervention neighborhood ) involve study . No POWER campaign material place neighborhood . All study participant baseline ask complete assessment document knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom . All study participant follow-up complete assessment similar baseline assessment , add question regard exposure POWER campaign . None assessment part regular clinical care participant . Inclusion exclusion criterion Persons meet eligibility criterion include woman age 15-25 speak English . Children recruit study include woman age 15-17 . Although woman pregnant exclude research , target recruitment . We request waiver parental permission COMIRB include woman age 18 study . Per California Nevada Statutes , minor allow consent contraceptive service , STD test pregnancy test without parental consent . Detailed justification request include full protocol . Minors ( 15-17 year old—determined time recruitment ) encourage discuss participation parent guardian prior enrollment study . Patient accrual We enroll 300 woman 12 study neighborhood baseline study 300 woman 12 study neighborhood follow-up study , total 3600 baseline , 3600 follow-up total 7200 entire study . This number include total number woman need sign consent form order reach study end point . This study employ neighborhood unit analysis . Thus , six neighborhood assign intervention status . Baseline data collect prior campaign implementation . The POWER campaign implement neighborhood nine month period . Follow-up data collection take place 12 study neighborhood . Thus , individual per se assign intervention control status , rather neighborhoods people live assign intervention control status . Estimated duration study The baseline data collection take place nine month , start month six project . The campaign last subsequent nine month , follow-up data collection take place next subsequent nine month , total 27 month . Persons enroll baseline and/or follow-up study spend total 20 minute complete consent process , self-administering questionnaire , receive incentive . Study instrument We ask participant baseline complete questionnaire document knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom . Participants follow-up study ask complete questionnaire identical baseline assessment , add question regard exposure POWER campaign . Data Safety Monitoring Plan Analyses study lead Dr. Sheana Bull , input CDC Colleagues Drs . Sam Posner , Lillian Lin Sherri Varnell . Three analysis strategy employ : ( ) comparison neighborhood-level ( unadjusted ) mean , ( b ) comparison neighborhood-level adjusted mean , ( c ) hierarchical modeling . We anticipate adverse event associate participation study beyond possible embarrassment reluctance answer sensitive question . That say , serious unexpected adverse event report IRB immediately . Dr. Sheana Bull oversee aspect study . The informed consent indicate medical care necessary person respond questionnaire , facilitate access care provide referral . It also indicate able pay care . The consent also offer two telephone number person wish obtain information study , referral information right research subject . Plans interim analysis . We regularly monitor recruitment risk behavior disclose participant assessment . Because need continue enrollment 7200 person determine intervention effective , plan stop study prior achieve enrollment . DSMB . Because behavioral study , offer low risk outside embarrassment answer personal question , plan convene data safety monitor board independently monitor work . Study conduct monitor day Dr. Sheana Bull , regularly track enrollment recruitment process . She responsible oversight protocol implementation project . Specific monitor duty include regular contact person recruit participant ensure protocol recruitment adhere . Procedures protect privacy subject maintain confidentiality data . All participant study ask sign consent form receipt acknowledge receive incentive study . These two form document identifier . We scan material keep electronic copy . We keep signed consent form separate complete questionnaire . Persons collect data place sign consent form receipt separate lock file complete questionnaire . All questionnaire data enter computer COHO server . This COHO dedicate server , firewall , login encryption security , none accessible outside COHO local area network . Statistical analysis plan data include development database use ACCESS ( Microsoft Corporation , 2002 ) store manage study data , import data SAS ( version 8.1 ) quantitative analysis . Analyses data baseline follow-up study concentrate establish knowledge , attitude toward use female male condom . Analyses follow-up study data also include documentation exposure project material , include open-ended question ability name relevant feature message relate material . We plan nest cross-sectional design baseline follow-up observation , implement randomize control community-level trial neighborhood unit randomization analysis . Neighborhoods block-randomized within city achieve balance intervention control condition city-level factor . Assuming intraclass correlation 0.02 sample size 300 per neighborhood study 80 % power detect difference proportion intervention control communities 20 % ( 45 % vs. 36 % ) . Risks-Subjects There anticipated risk relate research . We believe participant may experience embarrassment psychological discomfort relate subject content . There anticipated physical legal risk face participant . Investigators/Institutions There anticipated risk investigator institution relate research . Benefits It anticipated person enrol study live intervention neighborhood expose project material contain useful information prevent pregnancy STD infection . We make campaign material available control neighborhood collect follow-up data , information available study participant . If show effective , campaign extremely cost effective way deliver important information one reach much large audience typically see clinic setting . If program show effective , useful data limitation POWER campaign promotion increase condom use . Funding All funding study provide Association Teachers Preventive Medicine Centers Disease Control Prevention . Participants baseline study receive $ 10 complete questionnaire . Participants follow-up study receive $ 10 complete questionnaire . These monies prorate , woman partially complete questionnaire receive $ 5 . Special consent issue We seek waiver parental consent woman age 15-17 participating study . Justification say waiver include section inclusion exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
