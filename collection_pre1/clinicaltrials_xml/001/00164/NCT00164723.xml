	<brief_title>Endoscopic Evaluation Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding ( GIB ) Patients Presenting With Melena</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although tarry stool common feature peptic ulcer bleeding , also manifestation lower gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding . Examples include colonic cancer , small bowel tumor , small large bowel ulcer induce aspirin painkiller ( NSAIDs ) . However , clinician often mislead find peptic ulcer source GI bleeding . It uncommon detect peptic ulcer incidentally source bleed actually low GI tract ( e.g . NSAID- aspirin-induced small large bowel bleed ulcer , small bowel tumor , colorectal cancer ) . Delay diagnosis lower GI bleed often lead serious consequence . The preferred investigation low GI bleed colonoscopy plus video capsule endoscopy . Colonoscopy gold standard diagnosis colonic bleeding . The risk colonoscopy-induced complication bleed perforation le 1 3500 . Video capsule endoscopy non-invasive , safe accurate technology approve FDA investigation small bowel disease . The video capsule 11x 26mm capsule encases digital camera , light-emitting diode , battery , transmitter . The patient need swallow video capsule overnight fast wear record device eight hour . Images take twice-per-second transmitted record device . Oral feeding resume four hour . There restriction daily activity . The swallowed capsule expel naturally 5 12 hour virtually patient . The risk capsule retention low occur patient severe small bowel stricture . This study aim assess incidence etiology lower GI bleed patient present tarry stool . The result provide important information magnitude problem lower GI bleed improve patient care .</detailed_description>
