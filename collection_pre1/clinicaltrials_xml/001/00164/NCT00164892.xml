	<brief_title>Selective COX-II Inhibitor Adjuvant Therapy Patients With Resectable Advanced Stomach Cancer ( Histological Staging ≥ T2N1 ) - A Multi-Centre Prospective Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) family enzymes regulate conversion arachidonic acid prostaglandin . COX-II inducible enzyme , may upregulated stimulus inflammation hypergastrinaemia . Despite radical surgery , patient stomach cancer advance stage often poor prognosis . Reported survival disease stage IIIa le 40 % . Methods improve patient outcome explored decade little success . In light current understanding relation COX-II stomach cancer , selective COX-II inhibitor may use novel adjuvant therapy gastrectomy prevent recurrence gastric carcinoma . The advantage COX-II inhibitor relatively non-toxic minimal side effect .</detailed_description>
