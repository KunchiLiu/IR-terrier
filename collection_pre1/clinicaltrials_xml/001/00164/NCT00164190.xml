	<brief_summary>Background : In Canada , patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) present hospital without cardiac catheterization facility . Thrombolytic therapy remain standard-of-care centre . However , thrombolytic therapy achieve normal coronary flow myocardial perfusion le 50 % patient , associate reocclusion , reinfarction , recurrent ischemia . Primary angioplasty result complete reperfusion lower rate reocclusion , reinfarction recurrent ischemia , available centre . Although patient transfer primary angioplasty , long transport time associated bad outcome . An alternative strategy , describe facilitated angioplasty , involve administration thrombolytic therapy community hospital follow immediate transport angioplasty . This approach achieve benefit primary angioplasty without delay treatment . A well-conducted , prospective , randomized trial need compare strategy facilitate angioplasty standard thrombolytic therapy . Objectives : To evaluate safety , feasibility , efficacy routine transfer patient AMI angioplasty centre immediately thrombolysis coronary angiography percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Hypothesis : A strategy routine transfer patient AMI angioplasty centre immediately thrombolysis coronary angiography percutaneous intervention associate significantly low incidence composite death , reinfarction , recurrent ischemia , heart failure , shock 30 day compare conventional strategy thrombolysis transfer reserve failed reperfusion and/or development shock . Research Plan : Patients ST-elevation myocardial infarction high-risk characteristic present community hospital without cardiac catheterization facility receive thrombolysis tenecteplase heparin ( unfractionated low molecular weight heparin ) randomize one two strategy : facilitate PCI standard treatment ( thrombolysis provisional rescue PCI ) . In facilitated PCI group , patient transfer immediately angioplasty centre urgent cardiac catheterization , PCI appropriate . In standard treatment group , patient undergo urgent angiography evidence fail reperfusion and/or development cardiogenic shock . The primary endpoint composite death , reinfarction , recurrent ischemia , heart failure , shock 30 day .</brief_summary>
