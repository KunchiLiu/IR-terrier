	<brief_title>Surveillance Bleeding Peptic Ulcer Using Wireless Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Acute gastrointestinal bleeding common medical emergency worldwide . In Hong Kong account 5 % admission Accident Emergency Department1 . The common cause bleed peptic ulcer . Ulcers bleed artery base ulcer erode , Bleeding erode artery may intermittent , artery may plug thrombus . Dislodgement clot result rebleeding . Rebleeding long recognize one bad prognosticator ulcer bleed associate 6-10 fold increase mortality . Rebleeding associated major bleed manifest hematemesis hypotension , indicate large size vessel erode . Such vessel , clot plugging , may visible endoscopically name “ stigma recent haemorrhage ” . Such stigma associate high risk rebleeding . High-risk stigma , active bleeding , protuberant “ visible vessel ” , adherent clot , use select patient liable rebleed endoscopic therapy . In recent year , advance endoscopic technology expertise , therapeutic endoscopy take first line therapy bleeding5 . Techniques injection therapy , thermal coagulation clip application show highly effective control bleeding7 . Rebleeding endoscopic therapy Rebleeding important prognostic factor patient ulcer haemorrhage . It carry 10-fold increase mortality . Rebleeding predicted hematemesis shock admission . Before era therapeutic endoscopy traditional dogma recommend early surgery preempt another catastrophic bleed patient . With advent effective endoscopic haemostasis place early surgery less clear . Indeed trial center indicate repeat endoscopic therapy salvage 75 % rebleeding patient without compromise patient safety10 . Scheduled repeat endoscopy 24 hour interval use detect retreat remain stigmata11 . Such policy also subject many patient unnecessary endoscopy treatment show improve outcome . Re-endoscopy 24-hour interval miss rebleeding occurs interim , repeat endoscopy closer interval impractical . Some author suggest combine clinical endoscopic data score system select patient repeat endoscopic re-treatment , demonstrate improved outcome small series . Others use Doppler signal artery ulcer base predict failure endoscopic treatment . Recognition rebleeding – Use wireless endoscopy Clinical rebleeding usually define vomit red blood , hemodynamic instability drop hemoglobin level initial stabilization . These clinical feature appear significant amount blood lose . There , present , reliable method detect rebleeding timely fashion . If reliable early warning system , analogous ECG monitoring arrhythmia patient myocardial infarction , may able intervene time preempt harmful effect major blood loss patient already bleed ulcer . Endoscopy use pill size ( 11mm x 26mm , weight ~ 4 gram ) capsule endoscope first report Iddan . The capsule swallow transmit image various part gastrointestinal tract capsule traverse gastrointestinal tract . The main indication present visualization small intestine , especially locate source bleed beyond range gastroscopy colonoscopy . The battery capsule last 8 hour . We aim use capsule endoscope monitor bleed peptic ulcer therapeutic endoscopy order detect rebleeding clinical manifestation .</detailed_description>
