	<detailed_description>The study population consist sample patient population ( men age 40-79 year ) large , group model HMO community sample men age 50-79 . Follow-up interview men randomly assign intervention control group conduct telephone ass issue relate prostate cancer screen men ’ use CD-Rom educational intervention . Preliminary result available first 1304 follow-up interview ( interim response rate = 26 % ) . Of 554 men randomize receive CD-ROM , 227 ( 41 % ) report receive CD-ROM , 78 ( 14 % ) use computer . About 51 % 78 men use CD-ROM , 42 % use twice , 27 % share someone else . Most user report learn ( 44 % ) great deal ( 46 % ) new information CD-ROM , report help organize thought screen somewhat ( 44 % ) great deal ( 28 % ) . About 19 % indicated CD-ROM increase uncertainty somewhat great deal whether want screen , 30 % report CD-ROM change feeling whether want screen somewhat , 12 % report changed feeling great deal . Men use CD-ROM high education , high income , high level computer usage , likely previously PSA test compare non-users . No subject characteristic significantly relate use . Using randomized group assignment “ intention treat ” analysis , prostate cancer knowledge significantly high intervention group ; difference study group decisional conflict realistic expectation . However , compare use CD-ROM use multiple regression analysis control difference age , race , education , income , insurance status , previous receipt prostate cancer screening , computer usage , use CD-ROM significantly associate high prostate cancer relate knowledge , low decisional conflict , realistic expectation risk die prostate cancer . After control difference user non-users find evidence CD-ROM effective reduce decisional conflict , increase knowledge realistic expectation related prostate cancer screening .</detailed_description>
