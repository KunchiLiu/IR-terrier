	<detailed_description>I. Background/Rationale Recurrent abdominal pain common complaint among school-age child , present 15 % give time . It represent common chronic pain entity pediatric patient . These patient frequently dyspepsia define upper abdominal pain discomfort . ( 1 ) Eighty-three percent child refer institution recurrent pain dyspepsia . Shaffer , et al , find dyspepsia present 73 % 154 child recurrent abdominal pain . ( 2 ) We find mucosal eosinophilia 71 % child undergo endoscopy mucosal biopsy dyspepsia . However , eosinophil density necessarily correlate eosinophil activation many eosinophil-derived mediator bioactive concentration-dependent fashion . ( 3 ) In previous investigation , find evidence moderate extensive eosinophil degranulation biopsy dyspeptic child normal mucosal eosinophil density . ( 4 ) Montelukast competitive antagonist cys LT1 receptor affinity similar , low leukotriene D4 . ( 5 ) We others previously report good clinical response montelukast patient eosinophilic gastroenteritis . ( 6-9 ) Recently , Vanderhoof Young ( 8 ) report eight patient dysphagia , diarrhea , and/or constipation associate tissue eosinophilia prolong remission symptom montelukast therapy . This experience prompt u undertake double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over trial montelukast dyspeptic child duodenal eosinophilia . We able demonstrate superiority montelukast compare placebo relief pain . ( 9 ) Despite average duration pain nearly 22 month prior study enrollment , approximately one-half patient become pain free nearly pain-free two week course therapy montelukast . Also interest particular study find montelukast pharmacokinetics , thus exposure , different previously observe child receive drug . Specifically , average population elimination t-1/2 montelukast subject ( 1.8 hour ) substantially short mean value parameter ( 3.4 hour ) determine child without concurrent intestinal disease . ( 5 , 10 ) While reason apparent disparity clear , possible local montelukast metabolism ( ie. , small intestine ) may vary consequence disease state . Nonetheless , remain determined whether link systemic tissue level whether exposure-response relation establish montelukast pediatric patient eosinophilic duodenitis . Finally , mechanism responsible demonstrated clinical efficacy montelukast disorder establish . It possible therapeutic effect might result consequent lower eosinophil density , alteration eosinophil activation state , block leukotrienes release eosinophil ( cell ) site action , combination aforementioned effect . The clinical effectiveness medication eosinophilic esophagitis previously find associate decrease eosinophil density , activation state assess . ( 11-12 ) As well , previous investigation therapeutic intervention disorder address exposure-response relationship . II . Hypothesis The beneficial therapeutic effect montelukast patient eosinophilic duodenitis determine activation state local density eosinophil , attainment sufficient systemic local exposure . III . Objectives / Specific Aims A . To determine effect montelukast mucosal eosinophil density activation state pediatric patient eosinophilic duodenitis present dyspepsia . B . To evaluate relationship clinical response , systemic drug exposure , local tissue drug concentration , eosinophil density activation state . IV . Methods A . Study Population A total 24 patient evaluate Children 's Mercy Hospitals Clinics enrol study . 1 . Inclusion Criteria A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : 1 . Patients dyspepsia define upper abdominal pain discomfort least two month duration . 2 . Male female subject 6 - 17 year age 3 . Endoscopic mucosal biopsy reveal least 20 eosinophil high power field specimens duodenum absence define duodenal pathology . 4 . Written inform consent sign subject 's legal guardian investigator patient assent . 2 . Exclusion Criteria Subjects eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . A subject previously treat montelukast . 2 . Treatment steroids oral cromolyn four week prior endoscopy study . 3 . Any history , clinical , and/or biochemical evidence clinically significant renal liver disease . 4 . Treatment inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 . 5 . Intake grapefruit juice oral vitamin E supplementation - Patients meet criterion except 1.c . approach enrollment prior initial endoscopy . With consent , two duodenal biopsy obtain process EM evaluation pending histologic evaluation determine whether patient meet criteria 1.c . If patient meet criterion 1.c. , EM specimens discard . 3 . Methods 1 . Treatment : All patient receive open-label , 21 day course montelukast dose two 5 mg tablet daily , give 0700 0800 . 2 . Assessment treatment response 1. . Global evaluation - A five point global pain relief evaluation conduct single investigator day 21 . The evaluation employ Likert-type scale adapt assess change pain discomfort follow : Grade 1 : Worse - clinical deterioration increase pain intensity and/or frequency Grade 2 : No change - increase decrease pain intensity frequency . Grade 3 : Moderate improvement - partial clinical response definite improvement pain , meeting criterion Grade 4 response . Grade 4 : Good - nearly complete relief symptom minimal residual pain discomfort . Relief denoted adequate patient . Pain interfering daily activity . Grade 5 : Excellent - complete relief pain discomfort . 2. . Mucosal Eosinophils On day 21 therapy , patient undergo follow endoscopy obtain mucosal biopsy . All endoscopy perform usual fashion , include obtain standard biopsy ( 2 esophageal , 2 antral , 4 duodenal ) . Patients also two additional duodenal biopsy obtain electron microscopic ( EM ) evaluation . Both peak mean eosinophil density determine single observer pre- post-treatment specimen . The observer blind specimens pre- post-treatment . 3. . Laboratory On day 21 , time endoscopy , blood sample obtain patient determination serum eosinophil cationic protein concentration . Serum frozen save period exceed 24 month study completion use determination serum protein concentration may determine possible clinical physiologic relevance . 3 . Pharmacokinetic analysis On day 21 , patient report GI procedure room three hour prior endoscopy . An intravenous catheter place procedure . At 2.5 hour prior procedure , patient receive two , 5 mg montelukast tablet 2 oz water time record . Blood sample obtain 1 , 2.5 , 6 hour post-dosing . Plasma move follow centrifugation store -70ºC . At time endoscopy ( approximately 2.5 hour post-dosing ) , multiple duodenal mucosal biopsy ( appx . aggregate tissue yield = 0.5 gm ) obtain determination tissue drug concentration . All serum tissue drug determination determine manufacturer ( Merck ) use validate HPLC method use support two previous pharmacokinetic study montelukast ( 9,10 ) conduct pediatric patient , successfully use aforementioned approach pharmacokinetic data analysis . V. Statistical Analysis Pre- post-treatment eosinophil density , degranulation index , ECP concentration , respectfully , compare use paired t-tests . Changes density , degranulation index , ECP pre- post-treatment compare responder ( Grade &gt; 3 ) non-responders ( Grade 1 2 ) , respectively , repeat measure ANOVA . Statistical analysis pharmacokinetic data utilize combination approach assess potential interaction montelukast disposition response . Relationships continuous variable ( eg. , dose , ECP concentration ) evaluate linear nonlinear regression technique . A two-tailed , Student 's test use evaluate difference disposition ( eg. , plasma vs. tissue concentration ) response associate gender also , examine exposure-response relationship subject classify pain relief assessment . Finally , logistic regression technique use examine interaction multiple covariates ( eg. , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter , biochemical parameter reflective eosinophil activation , demographic parameter , etc. ) . All statistical analysis complete use SSPS software package ( version 9.0 , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) use significance limit α = 0.05 . VI . Sample Size Estimate/Power Calculation Calculations complete base tissue eosinophil density estimate . The initial ( pre-treatment ) eosinophil count obtain data obtain initial montelukast trial ( 9 ) assume standard deviation would remain equal percent mean post-treatment . Calculations base achieve 80 % power perform two-sided paired t-test significance level α = 0.05 . 1 2 3 4 Pre-treatment mean 34 34 34 34 Post-treatment mean 10 20 25 27 N = 5 10 20 30 We choose sample size 24 patient allow patient drop rate approximately 15 % ( twice rate original study ) . VII . Projected Timeline Study Completion It estimate take 16 week enroll entire cohort subject . An additional 8 12 week allocate sample analysis Merck , follow additional 4 6 week data analysis report generation .
