	<brief_summary>The goal study examine cortical activity speech perception speech production idiopathic stutterer compare fluent speaker . Therefore , noninvasive method magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) use . A good understanding complexity speech perception pathology develop . Fundamental property stutter repetition , prolongation , block . In case stutter emerge 2 5 year age . The auditory feedback become less important development , soon information mispronounce word occur anymore . During speech development control function adopt system . In stutterer dominance acoustic control remain . Brain imaging study positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) show defect network motor system , lateralization speech area , function auditory cortex . Magnetoencephalographic study describe similar variety cause stutter . There may defect auditory feedback , modification lateralization speech area , alteration co-action motor plan auditory system . The benefit magnetoencephalography good temporal resolution range millisecond combine good spatial resolution . Therefore , well suit examine dynamic cortical processing stuttering . In study evoke component auditory system relate complex sound , vocal , consonant-vocal combination , single word analyze . Differences component auditory cortex stutterer fluent speaker hypothesize well temporal structure localization lateralization .</brief_summary>
