	<brief_title>Kaletra Sex/Gender Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association patient sex tolerability antiretroviral drug ( ARVs ) increasingly recognize . Several line evidence suggest woman likely men develop side effect ARVs . On hand , generally accept efficacy ARVs similar sex . However , recent study suggest may always case . In addition observe sex-related difference effect ARVs , grow evidence pharmacokinetic profile drug may different among male female HIV infect patient . The fact female sex risk factor enhance antiretroviral effect ( include toxicity ) important implication , particularly global health perspective woman represent fast grow segment HIV/AIDS epidemic . Therefore , understand magnitude , clinical significance , mechanism underlie phenomenon deserves study . Knowledge acquire study likely contribute improve survival among female HIV-infected patient , optimization antiretroviral therapeutic regimen manner minimize serious adverse effect improve adherence . Similarly , influence race pharmacological effect ARVs deserve investigation . Although , reason believe base available evidence racial difference exist pharmacological effect ARVs , need however exist explore influence race ARVs pharmacokinetics treatment outcomes . This data race related difference ARV effect limit , addition , people ethnic minority disproportionately represent clinical trial involve drug spite fact bear large burden HIV epidemic . Our study examine influence race sex 24-hr pharmacokinetics lopinavir/ritonavir ( antiretroviral agent commonly use naïve patient ) follow switch LPV/r 400/100 mg twice daily 800/200 mg daily dosing . Tolerability ( measure toxicity grade diarrhea ) change quality life follow switch twice daily daily dosing also assess use appropriate validated measurement tool .</detailed_description>
