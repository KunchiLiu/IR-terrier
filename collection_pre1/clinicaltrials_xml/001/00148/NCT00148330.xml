	<brief_title>Open Label Extension Clinical Trial Intravitreal Triamcinolone Diabetic Macular Oedema-TDMX Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 25 fold increase risk go blind diagnosis diabetes one daunting threat patient face . People use insulin particularly challenge unable accurately draw dose drug . Most case vision impairment diabetes due macular oedema persist recur laser treatment . There number uncontrolled , anecdotal report intravitreal triamcinolone ( IVTA ) highly effective treatment diabetic macular edema refractory conventional laser treatment . We commence first placebo-controlled , double mask clinical trial IVTA refractory macular oedema 2002 . The 3 month result study provide first scientific proof principle IVTA reduce macular thickness improve vision . The two year result available March 2005 , confidential interim analysis efficacy data September 2004 suggest beneficial effect triamcinolone treatment persist . Thus appear treatment IVTA may significant development prevention blindness people diabetes since introduction laser treatment . It would also highly cost-effective intervention could administer general ophthalmologist . The treatment recommend routine use , however , long term efficacy safety establish . Since already well study group patient receive treatment 2 year , unique position extend study order provide long-term ( 5-year ) safety efficacy data appear forthcoming source . The completion study direct immediate effect risk blindness people diabetes allow doctor predict accurately long term effect promise new treatment .</detailed_description>
