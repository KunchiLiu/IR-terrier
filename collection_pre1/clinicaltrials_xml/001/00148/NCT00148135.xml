	<brief_summary>This study patient type cancer call carcinoma unknown primary site ( CUP ) , mean site body tumor originate clear . Currently , carcinoma unknown primary site ( CUP ) account 5 % newly diagnose malignancy . The stage tumor treatable surgery . Currently , standard treatment type cancer stage chemotherapy . However , overall prognosis patient metastatic CUP remain poor , even treat conventional chemotherapy . Through ongoing research medical center around world , doctor try improve presently available chemotherapy regimen . The purpose investigator ' study similar : try determine whether combination three chemotherapy drug - carboplatin , gemcitabine , capecitabine - improve treatment patient metastatic CUP . The reason investigator interested combination chemotherapy agents one already used patient variety specific tumor , lung cancer , breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , colon cancer , etc . This research study help determine whether combination carboplatin , gemcitabine capecitabine use effective patient carcinoma unknown primary site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Carboplatin , Gemcitabine , Capecitabine Patients With Carcinoma Unknown Primary Site</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma unknown primary site ( CUP ) account approximately 5 % newly diagnose malignancy . The overall prognosis patient CUP remain poor , median survival less one year modern chemotherapy combination virtually long-term survivor . It recognize patient CUP represent heterogeneous group tumor . Managing patient CUP require complete medical history , careful consideration finding physical exam , target radiologic study pathologic analysis biopsy and/or surgical specimen . Within heterogeneous group exist least four subset patient CUP , base clinicopathologic feature treat regimen demonstrate efficacy tumor originate likely primary site CUP ; squamous carcinoma involve mid high level cervical lymph node , woman isolate axillary adenopathy contain adenocarcinoma , woman predominant presentation peritoneal carcinomatosis young men extragonadal germ cell syndrome . Unfortunately , majority patient CUP fall subset represent therapeutic dilemma , single regimen date show significant activity result prolonged survival patient particularly poor prognosis . Thus , new therapeutic combination need investigate treatment patient CUP . Platinum compound cornerstone chemotherapy regimens wide variety solid tumor , include lung , urothelial , head neck , ovarian endometrial carcinoma , well testicular carcinoma . Cisplatin analog carboplatin currently use chemotherapy combination treat CUP . Carboplatin few non-hematologic side effect compare cisplatin include less nausea vomiting , peripheral neuropathy , nephrotoxicity ototoxicity make attractive agent combine drug . In recent year , new agent active solid malignancy develop . Gemcitabine one agent . It deoxycytidine analogue structurally related cytosine arabinoside . Gemcitabine activate deoxycytidine kinase three step phosphorylation difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate , incorporate DNA , lead chain termination . Gemcitabine show activity pancreatic , breast , non-small cell lung carcinoma well carcinomas unknown primary site . Because mild toxicity profile , gemcitabine use combination chemotherapy agent . There evidence vitro vivo synergy gemcitabine platinum compound . Capecitabine orally administer fluoropyrimidine undergoes three-step conversion 5-FU , pharmacokinetics mimic low dose continuous infusion 5-FU . The oral formulation allow convenient continuous therapy , avoid need central venous catheter external infusion pump . The final step conversion capecitabine 5-FU catalyzed thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) , enzyme show expressed colorectal tumor . This selective tumor activation demonstrate lead high concentration 5-FU tumor cell compare normal tissue , suggest tumor target oral drug . Capecitabine initially approve FDA treatment refractory breast carcinoma show activity metastatic colorectal carcinoma . Capecitabine attractive agent use combination chemotherapy due non-overlapping toxicity profile many agent lack hematologic toxicity . Gemcitabine combine 5-FU , may enhance activity 5-FU vivo . Gemcitabine inhibitor ribonucleotide reductase , enzyme need synthesis deoxynucleotides , 5-FU interferes dTTP synthesis inhibition thymidylate synthase ( TS ) . It plausible concomitant administration gemcitabine capecitabine , may result increased cytotoxicity reduce intracellular dTTP thru two different mechanism , thereby inhibit DNA replication repair . Platinum compound lead cell death form DNA adduct cause double strand break . By inhibit DNA synthesis repair , gemcitabine 5-FU analogue could potentiate activity carboplatin . These interaction may underlie clinical synergism observe platinum/5-FU platinum/gemcitabine combination . We propose combine carboplatin , gemcitabine capecitabine palliative treatment patient CUP . Programs evaluate incorporation new chemotherapy agent combination reasonable attempt improve outcome patient CUP . In addition anticipate anti-tumor activity , propose combination provide convenient schedule brief intravenous treatment , use oral agent capecitabine , toxicity profile expect mild , characteristic important palliative treatment program .</detailed_description>

Directed radiologic evaluation include , minimum , computerize tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis bilateral mammography female patient . Pathologic immunohistochemistry study surgical biopsy specimen , include study estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor PSA stain clinically appropriate . Patients must least 18 year age Zubrod performance status 02 . Adequate organ function , define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/ul , platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul , serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl , serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl . Patients must measurable disease . ( Partial response [ PR ] least 30 % decrease sum LD target lesion take reference baseline sum LD . ) Patients may previously untreated receive one chemotherapy regimen provide include carboplatin , gemcitabine capecitabine . Patients must serious intercurrent medical psychiatric illness would limit ability provide informed consent receive protocol therapy . Patients must inform investigational nature study provide write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline prior initiation therapy . Patients previous invasive malignancy within precede 5 year ineligible unless clinicopathologic information regard current neoplasm clearly discordant prior disease . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cancer site eligible . Patients brain metastasis eligible . No concurrent chemotherapy , biological radiotherapy allow . Pregnant lactate woman eligible . Women men childbearing potential must agree use effective contraception throughout treatment period , six month treatment discontinue . The following group patient eligible study represent population patient CUP specific treatment approach available : 1 . Patients present squamous carcinoma isolate middle high cervical lymph node 2 . Women present isolated axillary lymphadenopathy 3 . Women present predominant peritoneal carcinomatosis 4 . Men &lt; 50 year age present predominant mediastinal and/or retroperitoneal nodal involvement biopsy show undifferentiated poorly differentiate carcinoma .</criteria>
