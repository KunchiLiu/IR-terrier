	<brief_title>Mechanical Heat Recovery Ventilation House Dust Mite Sensitive Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence asthma rise sharply UK . The house dust mite common trigger associate asthma , thrive humid microclimate favour modern housing . Could redress investment improve ventilation local housing ? In pilot study North Lanarkshire Council housing stock , demonstrate dust mite avoidance , combination installation domestic mechanical heat recovery ventilation ( MHRV ) , could inhibit re-colonisation house dust mites reduction indoor air humidity . In second phase , double blind randomized placebo- control trial test resultant effect asthma . It complete November 2006 . 140 patient asthma house dust mite allergy recruit new bedding , mattress cover carpet clean . All MHRV unit instal home , half activate , 12 month environmental clinical monitoring . The primary endpoint morning peak flow rate . Secondary endpoint include symptom score , spirometry , rate exacerbation , quality-of-life , economic evaluation . Demonstration well ventilate , energy efficient dwelling improve respiratory health patient allergic asthma could considerable importance help NHS cope commonest chronic disease Scotland .</detailed_description>
