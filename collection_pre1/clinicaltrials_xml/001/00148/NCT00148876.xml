	<brief_summary>This study do patient Breast Cancer metastasis ( patient positive receptor HER2 ) whose disease progress receive Trastuzumab . The primary objective study compare time disease progression Treatment Arm CAPECITABINE Treatment Arm CAPECITABINE + TRASTUZUMAB The study also secondary tertiary objective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TBP Study With Capecitabine Plus Minus Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial design : Prospective , multi-center , control , non blind , randomized phase III Study Treatment : Patients HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer progression previous treatment trastuzumab randomize either : A. Capecitabine 2500 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 progression * discontinuation Trastuzumab B. Capecitabine Trastuzumab : Capecitabine 2500 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 progression * Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg body weight every 3 week i.v . 90 min infusion progression * Objectives : Primary objective : To compare time disease progression patient HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer progression previous treatment trastuzumab randomize capecitabine alone combination trastuzumab . Secondary objective : To compare objective response rate two arm To compare duration response To compare clinical benefit define CR , PR , stable disease &gt; 24 week two arm To evaluate safety capecitabine + trastuzumab combination To compare overall survival two arm Tertiary objective : To determine HER2 status tissue collect directly study entry</detailed_description>
