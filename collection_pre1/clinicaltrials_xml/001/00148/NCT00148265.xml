	<brief_summary>This study likely identify improve economical treatment diabetic macular oedema , one commonest cause blindness Australia rest world.The specific aim study test follow hypothesis : - That intravitreal triamcinolone follow laser treatment result great improvement visual acuity placebo follow laser treatment eye macular oedema secondary diabetes ; - That intravitreal triamcinolone follow laser treatment result great degree resolution macular oedema placebo follow laser treatment eye macular oedema secondary diabetes ; - That intravitreal triamcinolone follow laser treatment result reduce requirement laser treatment control diabetic macular oedema placebo follow laser treatment ; - That intravitreal triamcinolone follow laser manageable acceptable safety profile eye diabetic macular edema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicentre Randomised Clinical Trial Laser Treatment Plus Intravitreal Triamcinolone Diabetic Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 25 fold increase risk go blind diagnosis diabetes one daunting threat people diabetes face . Stimulated several uncontrolled , anecdotal report , already conduct randomize clinical trial intravitreal triamcinolone treatment diabetic macular edema refractory conventional laser treatment . The analysis 3 month data study already unequivocally demonstrate treatment significantly reduce eliminates macular oedema short term result improve visual acuity . Thus intravitreal triamcinolone may represent significant development prevention blindness people diabetes since introduction laser treatment . It also highly cost-effective intervention administer general ophthalmologist . The next question answer , address directly present study , whether significant , synergistic beneficial effect intravitreal steroid combine current therapy ( laser ) . This study represent second major project undertaken Australian Retinal Collaboration ( ARC ) . The ARC aim set high attainable standard investigator-initiated clinical research retinal diseases Australia . Having enrol treated target 120 patient , currently complete RCT laser induce chorioretinal anastomosis central retinal vein occlusion , innovative Australian concept severe otherwise untreatable disease . The propose study likely identify improve economical treatment one commonest cause blindness Australia rest world . Intravitreal triamcinolone also intervention generate intense interest internationally , one member ARC acknowledge pioneer . Successful implementation study propose , feasible , highly likely immediate direct effect prevention vision impairment blindness people diabetes</detailed_description>
