	<brief_title>CHIZAP : Community- Health Facility-Based Intervention With Zinc Adjuvant Therapy Childhood Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Zinc deficiency major public health problem develop county . Poor zinc status associate stunt growth reduce resistance infection . Several vitro experiment vivo study animal human demonstrate detrimental effect zinc depletion almost facet immune system . The epithelial lining gut respiratory tract important resistance infection continuous cell division require proper function barrier . Zinc crucial cellular division maintenance organ cell rapid turnover , include epithelial cell . Clinical trial child develop country demonstrate improved growth reduce prevalence diarrhea respiratory tract infection follow zinc supplementation . Furthermore , zinc well-documented therapeutic effect give acute persistent diarrhea . The effect zinc may explain correction deficiency state and/or pharmacological , yet poorly describe , action . Due promise result previous study , WHO support large clinical trial Nepal , India Tanzania ass whether routine zinc supplementation reduces mortality early childhood . If result trial show mortality reduction , routine zinc supplementation zinc dense food may promote . However , first approach logistically difficult expensive , second approach difficult zinc dense food food low phytic acid content expensive readily available . Moreover , approach may perceive incompatible current breast-feeding recommendation young child develop country . There limited information zinc adjunct therapy pneumonia . A recent hospital-based study young child severe pneumonia , show zinc group faster recovery , result shorten stay hospital one day . However , study small community base study conduct far . Whether zinc effect respiratory infection assess study large sample size child less severe disease repeat child severe disease . Short-term zinc administration infection may become alternative addition long-term supplementation promotion zinc dense food . Furthermore , therapeutic administration zinc interfere current breast-feeding recommendation . Hypothesis : Zinc adjunct therapy pneumonia may lead fast recovery . Furthermore , long-term beneficial effect may include improved immuno-nutritional status measure thymus size , less morbidity improve growth . Comparison : Duration illness , risk treatment failure , severe pneumonia : length hospital stay . Number non-injury clinic visit hospitalization intervention Zinc 6 month period enrolment . Growth assess anthropometry thymus size assess ultrasonography . Explore efficacy zinc etiology-sub group include define nutritional status , inflammation , fever , gender , breastfeed status viral etiology .</detailed_description>
