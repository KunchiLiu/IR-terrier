Studies show drug beneficial patient colon cancer approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) purpose . The researcher conduct study see beneficial patient sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Cetuximab Patients With Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced Soft Tissue Bony Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcomas mesenchymal malignancy arise connective tissue throughout body afflict approximately 11,000 people United States yearly . Sarcomas heterogeneous well 50 subtypes describe . The peak incidence subtype-specific certain sarcoma see child young adult subtypes peak late middle-age , cause significant morbidity mortality young patient productive adult . The precise etiology sarcoma remain unknown . External radiation therapy establish risk factor . Other risk factor include occupational exposure certain chemical , lymphedema , hereditary condition neurofibromatosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome . Many sarcoma associate specific somatic genetic alteration . For example , specific subtypes associate gene translocation cause aberrant fusion protein include Ewing sarcoma ( EWS-FLI-1 ) , synovial sarcoma ( SSX-SYT ) , alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( PAX3-FHKR ) , myxoid liposarcoma ( TLS-CHOP ) . These singular molecular alteration imply sarcomas cytogenetically simple may appropriate substrate therapy target single molecular pathway . Sarcomas commonly present asymptomatic mass local symptom extremity retroperitoneum . Although tumor size , location , histologic subtype implicate prognostic factor sarcomas , histologic grade remain important factor . Tumor grade base degree cellularity , differentiation , pleomorphism , necrosis , number mitoses . Approximately 50-60 % patient high grade soft tissue sarcoma eventually metastatic disease , compare 5-10 % patient low grade disease . Sarcomas spread hematogenously common site spread lung , follow liver , bone , brain . About 50 % patient sarcoma eventually expire due locally advanced metastatic disease median survival 8-12 month .</detailed_description>

Patients consider child bear potential surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . 7 . If patient childbearing childfathering potential , must use barrier contraception intercourse treat study . 8 . Bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1,000/ul ; platelet 75,000/l . 9 . Renal function : creatinine 2.0 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 10 . Hepatic function : bilirubin 2.5 x ULN ; AST 5.0 x ULN . 11 . Patients must receive least one systemic chemotherapy treatment else refuse treat cytotoxic therapy . 12 . Twentyeight day elapse since patient receive prior systemic therapy . 13 . Patients must document symptomatic radiologic progression precede therapy . 14 . For patient treat prior radiation , 21 day elapse since administration last fraction radiation therapy patient must recover associated toxicity . 15 . Patients must measurable disease . The measurable lesion outside previously irradiate field document progression least 6 week completion radiation . Any following criterion make patient ineligible participate study : 1 . Acute hepatitis know HIV . 2 . Active uncontrolled infection . 3 . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction . 4 . Prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . 5 . Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . 6 . Any concurrent chemotherapy indicate study protocol investigational agent ( ) . 7 . Other active systemic malignancy within past year .</criteria>
