	<brief_title>A Study New Combination Schedule Chemotherapy Drugs Treatment Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 28,900 patient diagnose squamous cell cancer oral cavity pharynx year 2002 . Of , estimate 7,400 patient present metastasis develop recurrent disease , amenable surgery radiation therapy . Palliative chemotherapy thus treatment option . Currently , combination cisplatin 5-fluorouracil use first line treatment strategy , median time progression 2.5 3 month median survival rate 5 7 month . The time achieve maximum response combination therapy average 4 month . Taxanes , unique mechanism microtubule stabilization , demonstrate response rate similar standard , first line combination regimen . Several phase II study evaluate efficacy single agent docetaxel head neck cancer patient . Cumulative response rate approximately 30 % , high response rate observe patient receive prior chemotherapy . Docetaxel also use combination cisplatin cisplatin 5-fluorouracil . Although response rate combination regimens superior use single agent docetaxel , grade 3 4 toxicity also prevalent . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) , fluoropyrimidine carbamate , oral prodrug , convert tumor tissue 5-fluorouracil multienzymatic activation . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) document activity breast colorectal cancer widely administer . Because 5-fluorouracil efficacy treatment head neck cancer , reasonable consider tumor respond capecitabine . To date , publish trial use capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) treatment metastatic head neck cancer patient . However , clinical trial ongoing U.S. Europe promise result . In preclinical model , synergistic interaction capecitabine docetaxel document . One possible explanation synergy docetaxel up-regulates tumor level thymidine phosphorylase , enzyme essential activation capecitabine 5'-dFUrd 5-fluorouracil . Clinically , O'Shaughnessy , et al . recently report improved survival docetaxel/capecitabine combination therapy patient metastatic breast cancer , previously fail anthracycline-containing chemotherapy . In phase III study , patient stratify accord previous exposure paclitaxel randomize capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) ( 1250 mg/m2 twice daily , day 1-14 ) plus docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 day 1 , repeat every 21 day ) versus docetaxel alone . Grade 3 4 toxicity common docetaxel/capecitabine combination arm . Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) docetaxel interrupt dosage reduce 25 % patient experienced second occurrence give grade 2 toxicity , grade 3 toxicity , suggest start dosage perhaps high . The role chemotherapy metastatic head neck cancer limit palliation symptom disease . Platinum 5-fluorouracil combination remain standard first line treatment strategy . The taxanes show similar efficacy first line regimen often used salvage treatment patient metastatic disease . Given docetaxel document clinical efficacy head neck cancer preclinical data suggest synergy docetaxel capecitabine , reasonable consider use agent combination treat head neck cancer patient . Moreover , capecitabine docetaxel distinct mechanisms action overlap key toxicity . A recent phase I/II study Tonkin , et al . metastatic breast cancer patient demonstrate activity less toxicity docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week ( day 1 8 q21 day ) combine capecitabine 1800 mg/m2/day ( 14 21 day ) . In another phase I study Nadella , et al . weekly docetaxel ( 36 mg/m2 ) combine 14 day capecitabine ( 1500 mg/m2/day ) course 28 day . Antitumor responses observed patient breast , colon , bladder cancer . Hence , propose study whereby patient previously treat , metastatic/recurrent head neck cancer receive treatment docetaxel capecitabine . To reduce potential toxicity , use modification Nadella regimen . Docetaxel administer weekly dosage 30 mg/m2 3 every 4 week capecitabine administer flat dosage 2000 mg per day ( 1000 mg p.o . b.i.d . ) two week every 4 week . The justification use flat dosage capecitabine versus calculate dosage base pharmacokinetic data show change clearance capecitabine change BSA . We plan use fix dose 2000 mg qd ( 1000 mg q 1000 mg q pm ) . Fixed dose capecitabine convenient feasible , show prior University Michigan study breast cancer patient . In another study Schott , et al . informally piloted combination weekly docetaxel 36 mg/m2 1500 mg twice daily ( 3000 mg/day ) x 14 day capecitabine metastatic breast cancer patient , find without unexpected untoward side effect . Additionally , take advantage time course upregulation TP preclinical model , capecitabine dose give day 5-18 . In flat dose scheme , Nadella regimen would administer average dose 2125 mg qd 14 day , assume average BSA 1.7 m2 . We plan round dosage downward 2000 mg per day x 14 day ; therefore , regimen use slightly low dosage capecitabine . We feel propose slightly lower dose ( closer Nadella phase I dose vs. Tonkin ) capecitabine justify following reason : 1 . The Nadella study perform group patient solid tumor malignancy refractory conventional therapy effective therapy exist . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 1 2 5/17 ( 30 % ) patient , 10/17 patient receive 2 line previous chemotherapy , 7/17 patient receive previous radiotherapy . Based data previous treatment head neck cancer patient University Michigan , patient population enrol trial expect 60 % PS 0 40 % PS 1 , receive prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Like Nadella patient population , majority patient pretreated poor health . 2 . Dose interruption modification build protocol appropriate change treatment make patient Grade I II toxicity , toxicity becomes Grade III great . Since docetaxel give weekly , capecitabine administer daily , patient experience toxicity within cycle , dose either hold modify .</detailed_description>
