	<detailed_description>Background : Minority population disproportionately affect type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , likely due interaction genetic environmental risk factor . Several study document high prevalence insulin resistance , disparities quality care , microvascular macrovascular complication minority group . Recent evidence research group indicate insulin-using minority veteran poorer glycemic control ( measure HbA1c ) receive low dos insulin non-Hispanic white patient . Objectives : The goal mixed method descriptive , cross-sectional study elucidate patient , provider interactive patient/provider reason discrepancy , determine validate finding much large sample , use discover develop strategy remedy provider patient behavior order optimize health outcome . The objective mixed method study unpack provider decision-making patient self-care behavior responsible ethnic racial variation use insulin veteran T2DM receive VA care , adjust important covariates confounders . Aim 1 : Perform qualitative provider Nominal Group Technique design elucidate insulin prescribe decision-making behavior , possible reason racial/ethnic variation insulin use . Aim 2 : Perform qualitative content analysis patient focus group data insulin-using veteran VA care across African American , Hispanic non-Hispanic White ( NHW ) contrast . Psychosocial determinant self-care , diabetes care preference , patient/provider relationship issue , possible reason racial/ethnic variation insulin use explore . Aim 3 : Construct ) patient , b ) provider questionnaire reflective qualitative focus group data , nominal group process extant evidence-base finding , Aim 4 : Administer survey ) racially/ethnically diverse random sample insulin-using diabetic veteran receive care within VISN 18 , b ) assign primary care provider . Methods : This mixed method descriptive , cross-sectional study use 1 ) qualitative nominal group technique data ( provider ) , focus group data ( patient ) 2 ) provider nest patient survey data . The investigator use qualitative method explicate deconstruct etiologic association management strategy insulin-using patient provider use focus group content analytical method . Next , investigator use extant evidence evidence-base , focus group data conventional survey method construct two surveys-one target provider another survey randomly select population representative veteran nest within provider VA care , follow recommendation Hughes , O'Brien Dillman . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
