	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate effect erlotinib PSA response rate patient non-metastatic prostate cancer rise PSA androgen deprivation therapy . The secondary objective evaluate effect erlotinib duration PSA response , evaluate effect time PSA progression , evaluate toxicity erlotinib patient population , lastly , correlate effect erlotinib various epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -related protein use baseline immunohistochemical ( IHC ) study tissue block peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Erlotinib Patients With Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer With Rising Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients prostate cancer treat surgery radiation often develop recurrence cancer manifest rise PSA ( Prostate Specific Antigen ) level . Many patient treat hormone therapy . After fall PSA , patient eventually display evidence tumor progression clearly demonstrate another rise PSA level receive hormone therapy . Evaluation evidence tumor spread usually negative . There currently effective therapy approve use patient . The drug erlotinib work block activity protein call Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , locate surface many prostate cancer cell . Blockage protein show inhibit growth prostate tumor cell laboratory set animal experiment . Erlotinib give patient type cancer . A recently complete study show erlotinib improve survival patient advanced lung cancer fail standard chemotherapy . There currently effective therapy approve use patient condition . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness side effect drug erlotinib patient condition . Erlotinib investigational drug yet approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) use prostate cancer , approve use lung cancer . As previously state : The primary objective study evaluate effect erlotinib PSA response rate patient non-metastatic prostate cancer rise PSA androgen deprivation therapy . Secondary objective evaluate effect erlotinib duration PSA response , evaluate effect time PSA progression , evaluate toxicity erlotinib patient population , lastly , correlate effect erlotinib various EGFR-related protein use baseline immunohistochemical ( IHC ) study tissue block peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</detailed_description>
