The method use recruit subject extensive mammographic density enrol randomize trial receive one two kind dietary counselling . A control group receive general advice nutrition counsel change intake dietary fat carbohydrate , intervention group give intensive counsel reduce intake total fat target 15 % calorie increase intake carbohydrate maintain intake total calorie . Recruitment trial progress Toronto , Hamilton , London Windsor since 1991 , Vancouver since 1994 , 4,615 subject require trial recruit November 1998 . The trial explanatory seek determine biological effect dietary fat reduction term reduction breast cancer incidence . To meet goal select participant highly motivated subject increase risk breast cancer , provide high level assistance make dietary alteration , follow carefully ensure correct identification subject develop breast cancer , analyse result accord intention treat dietary compliance . This trial attempt ass directly possible effect dietary counsel health general public . II Specific Aims 1 . To recruit 4,615 Canadian woman extensive mammographic density enrol randomize trial dietary fat reduction follow 2006 . 2 . To compare control intervention group trial incidence breast cancer , well histological change breast tissue patient undergo surgical biopsy breast . 3 . To determine reduction dietary fat intake reduce either proportion breast area occupy radiological sign density total quantity density .</detailed_description>
