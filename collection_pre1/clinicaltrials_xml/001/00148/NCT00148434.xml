	<brief_summary>While patient hold guideline management chronic disease employed country . There little evidence effectiveness improve patient outcome . We hypothesise patient hold guideline management hypertension combine specific exhortation patient challenge medical care guideline appear apply would improve blood pressure control , low average blood pressure , low average cholesterol , increase appropriate use statins aspirin , impact patient anxiety . Patients randomise guideline standard hypertension information . Measures anxiety take baseline 2 week one year , blood pressure cholesterol measure one year case note examine determine appropriate statin aspirin usage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prevention treatment hypertension target organ disease remain important public health challenge must address ( SIGN 2001 ) . There sound evidence control hypertension significantly reduce incidence stroke cardiac event ( Mulrow Pignone 2001 ) . National guideline identification treatment hypertension issue ( Ramsey et al 1999 , SIGN 2001 ) local version national guideline issue GPs Lothian . However , although evidence patient hypertension identify , many hypertension adequately control ( Colhoun et al 1998 ) , GPs reluctant treat mild hypertension hypertension elderly ( Dickerson et al 1995a , b , Frijlen et al 2001 ) . Without additional intervention encourage change medical practice , effect clinical guideline generally limit ( Effective Health Care 1994 , Oxman et al 1995 ) . A large number additional intervention use encourage adoption clinical guideline include continue medical education , dissemination educational material , educational outreach , local opinion leader , audit feedback , manual computerise reminder , mass medium campaign , continuous quality improvement programme ( Effective Health Care 1999 ) . All effect , none overwhelmingly successful effective circumstance ( Effective Health Care 1999 , Davies et al 1995 , Grimshaw et al 1995 ) It suggest multiple intervention may effective single one ( Wensing Grol 1994 , Greco Eisenberg 1993 ) . There increase evidence Primary Care patient ’ expectation significant effect treatment get GP ( Tomlin et al 1999 , Howitt Armstrong 1999 ) . Mass medium campaign target patient find influence professional practice ( Grilli et al 2000 ) . However , evaluation effect locally provide patient information limited effect patient behaviour ( e.g . compliance dietary advice medication ) effect may medical practice . One initiative , fully evaluate , distribution guideline patient . The large AHCPR guideline programme United States include full guideline , summary professional summary patient ( Colling 1994 ) . Evaluation appear limited distribution guideline impact practice measure ( Colling 1994 ) . When Scottish ( SIGN ) clinical guideline programme initiate much AHCPR methodology adopt acknowledge , patient guideline include . The purpose study evaluate effect provide patient clinical guideline ( edit understandable lay person ) overall management control hypertension couple explicit exhortation medical team become involve care . 3 . Trial objective purpose : The trial aim determine provision patient guideline management hypertension . 1 . Improves control hypertension 2 . Improves compliance doctor establish guideline 3 . Increases patient anxiety Three research question set attempt meet aim . Does provision patient guideline management hypertension along explicit exhortation patient challenge care meet guideline . 1 . Improve control hypertension , evidence average blood pressure achieve number patient achieve control ( i.e . BP &lt; 150/90 ) 2 . Improve compliance doctor establish guideline evidence recorded calculation 10 year cardiovascular risk , appropriate use aspirin cholesterol lower agent , check cholesterol level blood cholesterol achieve , appropriate checking urea electrolytes frequency blood pressure monitoring . 3 . Increase patient anxiety . 4 . Trial design : ) A randomised trial set ass research question . 5 . Selection withdrawal subject : ) All hypertensive patient Ashgrove Health Centre Blood Pressure Clinic ( 435 ) recent baseline information blood pressure control available ( data recently collect extensive audit ) select invitation take part study . All send invitation/ information letter home address ask consent study Those participant consent study also ask complete questionnaire measure anxiety ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale : HADS ) return surgery use SAE . Those fail return response send reminder two week . Information booklets send participant consent ( whether anxiety questionnaire return ) . 6 . Treatment subject : ) All hypertensive patient ( least one systolic BP &gt; 150 ) Ashgrove Health Centre recent baseline information available invite take part study . As many household ( approx . 30 ) one hypertensive patient , randomisation take place household , rather individual level , people live address receive treatment . Participants randomise two group ( use random number generator ) . One group receive detail guideline record card derive Lothian Hypertension Guideline give general information blood pressure , also provide patient clear guideline blood pressure manage medical nursing staff clear exhortation question care guideline adhere ( see attach draft ) . They also give standard , high quality patient information booklet produce British Hypertension Society . The second group give British Hypertension Society booklet . This group specifically exhort challenge care way group . Doctors study told treat group differently . We anticipate Hawthorn effect doctor inevitably sensitise comply guideline rigorously group . All patient send letter explain study , consent form Hospital Anxiety Depression Score questionnaire . Those wish take part study ask return consent form questionnaire accompany stamp address envelope . Patients send booklet intervention group case booklet guideline . A HADS score send two week guideline identify immediate anxiety cause guideline . All patient call end year BP measurement . Case note search record BP monitoring , cardiovascular risk recording , cholesterol estimation , appropriate use cholesterol lower agent , appropriate use aspirin , actual blood cholesterol level , appropriate checking Urea Electrolytes . Patients ask complete HADS questionnaire ask find intervention perception involvement management blood pressure . Doctors nurse practice interview experience relation project term perceive increased workload experience ( perceive ) manage consultation empower patient . 7 . Statistics : ) This project pilot help calculate power future study . However , calculate study 80 % power detect significant 5 % level difference mean blood pressure order 2-3 mm Hg , 10-15 % percentage patient achieve BP target . Statistical analysis carry Dr . Rob Elton , statistical consultant . 8 . Data handle record keep : 1 . All patient record pull perused research nurse member staff Ashgrove Health Centre . While research data collect , keep completely confidential store password protect computer Ashgrove Health Centre . Once data collect , anonymised . No patient identifiable result , publish otherwise . 2 . Audio tap focus group staff completion study take place . The tape keep locked filing cabinet Department General Practice University Edinburgh . On completion tape transcription , tape destroy .
