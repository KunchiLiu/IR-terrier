	<brief_title>Preoperative Herceptin Navelbine Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- As part patient pre-treatment evaluation , clip place within tumor bed surgeon find time surgery . Four biopsy tumor obtain time clip placement test later date . - Depending upon patient 's risk level ( assessed treat physician ) , treat similarly one two regimen . The first 8 month regimens consist 12 week herceptin navelbine , follow surgery 4 cycle adriamycin cytoxan . The treatment follow 8 month depend upon health risk patient determine patient treat physician . - Group 1 : Lower Risk Regimen : Patients group receive 3 phase treatment . In Phase A receive Navelbine Herceptin intravenously every week 12 week . Upon completion therapy undergo surgery remove tumor . Following surgery 6 week recovery period treatment receive . In Phase B , patient receive adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) intravenously every 3 week 12 week , total 4 cycle . Patients may may receive Phase C ( depend upon physician discretion ) , receive herceptin intravenously every 3 week 40 week . If physician decides patient need radiation therapy , commence completion adriamycin cytoxan . - Group 2 : Higher Risk Regimen : Patients group undergo four different phase treatment . Phase A identical Group 1 ( herceptin navelbine 12 week follow surgery ) Phase B ( adriamycin cytoxan every 3 week 12 week total 4 cycle ) . Phase C consist paclitaxel herceptin weekly total 12 week . If physician decides radiation therapy perform , commence within 6 week last dose paclitaxel herceptin . In Phase D , patient receive herceptin intravenously every three week 28 week . - The following procedure test perform study : During Phase A : Every week : blood work ; Every 3 week : physical exam , tumor assessment bloodwork . During Phase B : Every 3 week ; physical exam blood work . At start Phase B C : physical exam , EKG , MUGA scan echocardiogram bloodwork . During Phase C : Every 3 week High risk patient every 3 month low risk patient ; physical exam blood work . End Phase C : MUGA scan echocardiogram . Phase C D : every 3 month ; physical exam , EGK , MUGA scan echocardiogram bloodwork . - At end study patient undergo physical exam , EKG , MUGA scan echocardiogram bloodwork .</detailed_description>
