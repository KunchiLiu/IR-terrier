	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial evaluate different exercise modality previously inactive subject type 1 diabetes . The primary objective study determine effect resistance exercise training , aerobic exercise training , glycemic control ( A1c ) previously inactive individual type 1 diabetes , background therapy meeting modern standard , include multiple daily insulin injection insulin pump , carbohydrate counting , frequent glucose monitoring , utilization glucose monitor adjust CHO insulin exercise . Secondary aim : In type 1 diabetic individual receive therapy meeting criterion , determine effect resistance exercise training aerobic exercise training frequency hypoglycemia , body composition , lipid , C-reactive protein quality life . Hypotheses : 1 . Subjects randomize resistance exercise ( R AR combine ) great reduction A1c randomize resistance exercise ( A C combine ) . 2 . Subjects randomize aerobic exercise ( A AR combine ) show trend great HbA1c reduction randomize aerobic exercise ( R C combine ) . Secondary hypothesis : We expect aerobic resistance exercise show trend improvement list secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Type 1 Diabetes Aerobic Resistance Exercise ( T1-DARE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Type 1 diabetes characterize complete near-complete absence insulin secretion , generally due autoimmune disease . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk type 1 diabetes great type 2 diabetic individual age , even though type 1 diabetic individual usually fewer additional CVD risk factor . This likely due early age onset diabetes therefore much long exposure hyperglycemia . The incidence type 1 diabetes increase throughout world . The reason think environmental although exact nature environmental precipitant well understood . In contrast type 2 diabetes , clear aerobic exercise improve glycemic control , study type 1 diabetes generally find significant beneficial effect aerobic exercise glycemic control , even though often reduction insulin requirement improve insulin sensitivity . This paradoxical finding may individual type 1 diabetes much high risk hypoglycaemia type 2 tend increase carbohydrate intake effort avoid exercise-induced drop glucose . The acute effect resistance exercise glycemia type 1 diabetes establish ; possible resistance exercise result smoother predictable decline blood glucose aerobic training , might reduce fear hypoglycemia consequent overcompensation . Resistance exercise training increase insulin receptor protein expression , true aerobic exercise training . Study Design : This randomize , control trial 2 2 factorial design ( resistance training versus resistance training ; aerobic training versus aerobic training ) previously inactive subject type 1 diabetes . After screen , qualify subject enter 5-week stabilization/run period prior randomization . During period diet insulin therapy assess optimize , week 2-5 also undergo three supervised session low-intensity exercise per week . Those demonstrate adequate compliance run-in period randomize equal number Aerobic Training ( A ) progress 45 min 3X/wk 75 % maximum heart rate , Resistance Training ( R ) 3X/week progress 3 set , 8 repetition 8 exercise maximum load lift 8 time ( 8RM ) , Aerobic Training Resistance Training ( AR ) waiting-list control ( C ) . The exercise intervention take place YMCAs metropolitan Ottawa . Subjects blind group assignment randomization , main study outcome measure blinded individual ( lab technologist ) use objective method . Subjects randomize wait list control begin program choice ( A , R AR ) 6-month outcome measure collect . Significance : This study address question clinical scientific importance . It help clarify benefit risk aerobic resistance exercise training people type 1 diabetes . Depending strength difference find , study either stand alone provide pilot data set stage large definitive study . Even result substantially different expectation , study provide valuable new information effect different exercise modality metabolic control , body composition , cardiovascular risk factor , quality life high-risk population .</detailed_description>
