	<brief_summary>The objective research determine electrical stimulation improve strength coordination lower limb muscle , walk ability stroke survivor . The knowledge gain study may lead enhancement quality life stroke survivor improve neurological recovery mobility . The result may lead substantial change standard care treatment low limb hemiparesis stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemiplegia major consequence stroke contribute significantly physical disability stroke survivor . Foot-drop , inability dorsiflex paretic ankle swing phase gait , ankle instability stance phase , important gait abnormality contribute reduce mobility among stroke survivor . In United States , standard care address deficit custom mold ankle-foot-orthosis ( AFO ) . However , evolve data demonstrate active repetitive movement training principal substrate facilitate motor relearn stroke . Motor relearn define reacquisition motor ability central nervous system injury . Thus , AFO may assist stroke survivor ambulate short-term , possible also inhibit recovery long-term . Previous study demonstrate active repetitive movement exercise mediate neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) facilitate motor relearning among stroke survivor . In particular , study report chronic stroke survivor treat peroneal nerve stimulator foot-drop experience sufficient recovery longer need peroneal nerve stimulator AFO community ambulation . However , blind randomized clinical trial rigorously evaluate motor relearn effect ambulation train peroneal nerve stimulators . Thus , primary aim project assess effect transcutaneous peroneal nerve stimulation lower limb motor relearn among chronic stroke survivor . The secondary aim ass effect transcutaneous peroneal nerve stimulation lower limb mobility ( disability ) overall quality life . A single-blinded randomized clinical trial carry assess effect ambulation train peroneal nerve stimulator among chronic stroke survivor compare ambulation train conventional standard care ( may include AFO ) . Subjects treat 12 week follow total another 6 month . This project determine effectiveness peroneal nerve stimulation facilitate motor relearn improve mobility quality life stroke survivor . This propose approach expect improve patient outcome challenge present clinical paradigm prescribe AFOs stroke survivor foot-drop .</detailed_description>
