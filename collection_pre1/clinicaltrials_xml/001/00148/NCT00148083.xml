	<brief_summary>The specific aim study determine whether new , long-acting , form risperidone , Risperdal Consta , improve ability schizophrenia patient benefit skill train . The hypothesis guide study Risperdal Consta , improve verbal memory , improve ability benefit skill train intervention among schizophrenia patient . The primary objective study compare patient Risperdal Consta patient atypical antipsychotic medication term ability benefit skill train intervention . A secondary objective study determine whether patient take Risperdal Consta improve area cognitive function social functioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Risperdal Consta Ability Benefit From Social Skills Training Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct University Illinois Chicago New York Presbyterian Hospital-Westchester Division . Patients schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder consider clinician clinically stable , stable still symptomatic , refer study . After obtain informed consent , patient randomize either Risperdal Consta control condition . Patients control condition remain oral antipsychotic medication duration study ( note - patient currently take oral risperidone eligible study ) . Patients randomize Consta condition take oral risperidone 3 day , adverse effect , begin receive injection Consta every 2 week next 6 month . During first month , remain oral risperidone , tapered end month along antipsychotic medication Consta . At baseline , every 4 week 6 month , patient complete computerized cognitive testing battery ( CogTest ) , interview social function symptomatology . During month 4-6 study participation , patient participate social skill group , UCLA Basic Conversation Skills Module . Before group , patient interview participate role-play base assessment regard skill taught group . Patients also receive physical exam , include ECG , baseline , monitor side effect adverse event every 2 week . The hypothesis driving study patient Consta group demonstrate great improvement verbal learning , skill acquisition train group , improve social functioning , course 6 month . This hypothesis base prior data demonstrate oral risperidone improve verbal memory , mediator skill acquisition structure skill train group . If hypothesis support , would important demonstration novel medication preparation ( injectable Risperdal Consta ) , combine psychiatric rehabilitation , improve functional outcome patient participate rehabilitation . Efficacy Measures : 1 . The primary efficacy measure study Micro-Module Learning Tests ( MMLT ) ( Silverstein et al. , press ) . This set 7 psychometrically equivalent test assess responsiveness key component skill train . Each test 3 part : 1 ) verbal learn component wherein patient read material actual skill train group ask question material ; 2 ) model component patient view model perform specific behavior videotape , ask question view ; 3 ) role-play component patient ask demonstrate , via role-play , behavior model demonstrate prior section . The MMLT dynamic assessment measure , addition measure people recall/perform initial presentation information , allow determination learn potential repeat exposure information . With MMLT , time question initially answer incorrectly , brief version material , highlight relevant information present . If incorrect answer give point , even focus version item present . With score system , responsiveness skill train occurs real world ( repetition material build teach method ) assess accurately use static assessment ( information present ) . 2 . A second primary efficacy measure Comprehensive Module Test Basic Conversation Skills Module . This measure administer group . 3 . A secondary efficacy measure CogTest computerize cognitive battery . This battery develop Tonmoy Sharma , M.D . colleague , use 2000 schizophrenia patient study risperidone Consta date . 4 . Another secondary efficacy measure Social Functioning Scale ( SFS ) ( Birchwood et al. , 1990 ) . This 74 item scale rat patient . The SFS seven subscales : 1 ) social engagement/withdrawal ; 2 ) interpersonal communication ; 3 ) independence-performance activity daily live ; 4 ) independence-competence perform activity daily live ; 5 ) frequency engagement recreational activity ; 6 ) frequency participation social activity ; 7 ) employment . 5 . A third secondary efficacy measure observational measure attentiveness group develop part PI ’ current NIMH grant cognitive rehabilitation schizophrenia . This measure allow u determine : 1 ) Risperdal Consta improve real-world measure attention ; 2 ) whether relationship skill acquisition , medication , attention . 6 . The final efficacy measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale , use measure symptom . Adverse Events : Side effect adverse event assess use semi-structured interview give research nurse psychiatrist . There 40 specific side effect 6 category ( general , neurological , cardiovascular , autonomic , urologic , muscular skeletal ) . Adverse event rat intensity scale 0 4 relationship medication 0 5 . Side effect count adverse event score 3 4 intensity ( moderate severe ) score 3-5 relationship ( possible definite ) . These adverse event aggregate one 6 group analysis across group . Serious adverse event include require medical intervention additional monitoring subject ’ primary physician medical hospitalization . All significant adverse event ( list side effect intensity level 4 ) review treat psychiatrist independent medical reviewer . Each site two independent medical reviewer ( one internist , one psychiatrist ) examine serious significant adverse event determine subject withdrawn study . The two reviewer directly connect research group investigator protocol . In addition assessment side effect , scale use measure side effect commonly associate antipsychotic medication . Each month , blind research assistant perform Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS , assess tardive dyskinesia ) , Barnes Akathisia Scale , Simpson-Angus Scale ( assess dystonia parkinsonian side effect ) . Movement disorder affect ability patient perform cognitive test skill train group . Patients akathisia often reduce attention reduce ability concentrate group . Patients parkinsonian symptom slower manual task may slower mental ability . Laboratory Assessment ( do baseline last month participation ) : 1 . Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) determine major hematological index antipsychotic medication affect white count . 2 . Complete Chemistries include electrolyte , BUN , creatinine , liver function test , glucose . Some antipsychotic medication may increase risk diabetes medication may cause increase liver enzyme . 3 . Lipid profile include cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL , HDL . Some antipsychotic medication cause increase lipid particularly triglyceride 4 . Prolactin : antipsychotic may increase prolactin lead menstrual irregularity , sexual dysfunction , possibly osteoporosis . Months 0 , 3 , 6 , . 5 . Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) : thyroid function affect cognition . Patients history hypothyroidism allow study stable dose replacement TSH normal range . Months 0 , 3 , 6 , . 6 . Glycohemoglobin ( HgA1c ) : measure overall level glucose prior 2-3 month . Months 0 , 3 , 6 , . Laboratory Assessment ( monthly ) 1 . For woman childbearing potential , urine screen pregnancy .</detailed_description>
