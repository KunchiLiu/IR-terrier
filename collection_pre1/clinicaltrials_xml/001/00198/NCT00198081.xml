	<brief_title>Use Celecoxib Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms ( IPMNs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efforts find successful chemotherapy pancreatic cancer disappointing . Some patient increase risk pancreatic cancer may pre-malignant pancreatic lesion predispose later pancreatic cancer development . In individual , chemopreventative measure may block future development pancreatic cancer . Human tissue study , cell culture animal model pancreatic cancer strongly suggest cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) may successful target chemoprevention . COX-2 overexpressed human pancreatic cancer . Elevated COX-2 expression correlate progression premalignant precursor pancreatic cancer development model hamster pancreatic cancer . Human tissue study confirm increase COX-2 expression progression premalignant precursor call intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm ( PanINs ) . Moreover , COX-2 inhibitor appear chemopreventative efficacy PC-1 homograft model hamster pancreatic cancer . Demographic study suggest COX-2 inhibitor may confer protection pancreatic cancer . We propose conduct pilot/phase II trial determine chemopreventative effect COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib patient premalignant pancreatic lesion . Patients register study take celecoxib twice daily 6-8 week prior surgery ( patient decides surgery his/her condition ) . If subject surgical candidate put surgical treatment , subject take celecoxib 6 month .</detailed_description>
