	<detailed_description>During Phase I , three group attend mandatory , 1 hour , bi-weekly group meeting . Participants keep food record 2 weekday 1 weekend day 2 week period well keep exercise , snack sleep log daily . At meeting , research staff collect complete food record log new form distribute . At week 8 16 active weight loss , participant repeat assessment ( blood test , body composition , questionnaire ) conduct baseline determine treatment-induced change dependent measure . During phase II , group participate group meeting hold 1 month begin maintenance quarterly 52 week . Dependent upon group , participant pick-up food bi-weekly body weight assessed every 4 week . The full battery assessment conduct 26 week end maintenance phase 52 week . Participants 180 adult ( male female ) 25 50 year age . The study design answer question involve adult population .

Participants preliminary eligibility , determine via phone screening , invite clinic in-depth screen include demographic medical history questionnaire psychosocial measure . Participants gibe consent provide information via complete screen consent form ( separate form study consent form ) . Once secondary eligibility determine , study consent form complete , participant undergo baseline screen physical measure , blood test ( CBC , SMA-20 ) , body composition assessment ( via bioelectrical impedance ) , complete additional psychosocial questionnaire . Any participant find ineligible result measure permit continue study , refer medical care appropriate . Participants deem eligible proceed weight loss phase .</detailed_description>
