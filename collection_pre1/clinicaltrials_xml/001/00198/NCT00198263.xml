	<brief_title>Study Using Medpulser Electroporation System With Bleomycin Treat Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electroporation therapy tumor-specific ablative treatment modality potential manage local tumor without potentially undesirable side effect systemic chemotherapy agent radiotherapy . Surgical resection solid tumor often leave subject significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement require reconstructive surgery . In contrast , electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control conventional surgery lessen need reconstructive surgery . Electroporation therapy may also provide economic benefit conventional surgical radiation procedure reduce operate theatre cost , hospital stay post treatment intervention . The ability shrink eliminate local tumor MedPulserÂ® System use conjunction intralesional Bleomycin important new possible treatment conservative local management SCCHN provide possible alternative treatment option surgical excision management cancer .</detailed_description>
