	<brief_summary>Several clinical study Western country reveal prevalence HIT 0.5 5 % , vary depend clinical setting . Thirty 50 % HIT patient suffer thromboembolic event , mortality HIT 10 20 % . In contrast , many physician Japan report experience treat HIT , although approximately 200,000 patient per year receive heparin . This raise possibility prevalence HIT might much low Japan Western country . In fact , neither drug HIT treatment laboratory test HIT diagnosis approve Pharmaceutical Affairs Law Japan . We therefore conduct multi-center , prospective cohort study determine prevalence profile HIT patient undergo cardiovascular surgery percutaneous coronary intervention . Approximately 1,500 patient enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Prevalence Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Cardiovascular Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heparin important anticoagulation treatment , especially cardiovascular patient . Recently , heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II ( HIT ) show immune-mediated , life-threatening side effect heparin therapy . Antibodies heparin-platelet factor 4 ( HIT antibody ) , induce heparin administration , major cause HIT . HIT antibody stimulate platelet endothelial cell , result excess production thrombin , induce thrombocytopenia thromboembolic event . HIT typically occur 5 14 day initial administration heparin ( typical-onset ) . HIT antibody transient detected 100 day cessation heparin treatment . Thus , patient develop HIT either day discontinue heparin ( delayed-onset ) soon re-administration heparin ( rapid-onset ) . HIT clinically diagnose drop platelet count less 100,000/μL 50 % decrease platelets initiation heparin therapy apparent explanation HIT . A positive laboratory test HIT antibody support clinical diagnosis . Several clinical study Western country reveal prevalence HIT 0.5 5 % , vary depend clinical setting . Thirty 50 % HIT patient suffer thromboembolic event , mortality HIT 10 20 % . In contrast , many physician Japan report experience treat HIT , although approximately 200,000 patient per year receive heparin . This raise possibility prevalence HIT might much low Japan Western country . In fact , neither drug HIT treatment laboratory test HIT diagnosis approve Pharmaceutical Affairs Law Japan . We therefore conduct multi-center , prospective cohort study determine prevalence profile HIT patient undergo cardiovascular surgery percutaneous coronary intervention . Approximately 1,500 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
