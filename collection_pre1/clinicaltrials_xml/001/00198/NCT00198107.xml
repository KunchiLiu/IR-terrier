	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Aripiprazole D-Cycloserine Treat Symptoms Associated With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism developmental disability affect every child differently . A wide range symptom accompany autism , include self-injurious behavior , severe aggression , irritability . Despite improved ability reduce symptom , exist drug treatment continue associated adverse side effect . Also , exist drug treatment reliably improve social behavior , core deficit autism . Studies drug treatment combination design reduce self-injurious behavior , aggression , irritability improve social behavior child autism yet conduct . This study address above-mentioned limitation evaluate aripiprazole reduce self-injurious behavior , aggression , irritability evaluate addition D-Cycloserine improve social behavior among child autism . This study include three phase add-on component child . Participants randomly assign receive either aripiprazole placebo treatment 8 week . Assessments measure irritability , behavior , social skill conduct end first phase . Those patient respond well aripiprazole continue receive aripiprazole treatment another 16 week . This second phase determine whether aripiprazole associate long-term maintenance symptomatic improvement patient respond well short-term treatment . Assessments conducted end 16-week period . Those patient whose symptom stabilize continue improve aripiprazole ask participate final phase study . During last phase , D-Cycloserine add treatment regimen . Patients take aripiprazole D-Cycloserine additional 8 week determine combination drug treatment result improve social behavior patient ' aggression self-injurious behavior stabilize aripiprazole . At end 8-week period , participant assess change behavior , irritability , social skill . Results study may aid develop safe effective drug treatment child adolescent autism . Add-study : The Effects Aripiprazole Brain Circuitry Children Adolescents Autism The purpose add phase conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled fMRI study brain activation connectivity pattern aripiprazole treatment 20 subject enter Study phase A . Children must able comply fMRI scan facial affect processing task . The child must ability lie still scan procedure comply instruction . The aim determine effect aripiprazole treatment amygdalar activation response negative facial emotional task vs. neutral ( control ) task . We hypothesize compare placebo , aripiprazole treatment increase amygdalar activation response negative facial emotion task . In addition hypothesize increase amygdalar activation positively correlate improvement behavioral rating scale .</detailed_description>
