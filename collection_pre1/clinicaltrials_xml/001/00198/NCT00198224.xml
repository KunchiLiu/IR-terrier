	<brief_summary>Valganciclovir ( VGCV ) recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment prevention cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis HIV patient . It review prevention CMV disease follow organ transplantation . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , morpholinoethyl ester mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) currently widespread use immunosuppressant kidney transplantation . These drug exerts effect block production DNA primarily lymphocytes . Recent study suggest combine MMF GCV vitro may beneficial effect treatment CMV infection . However , effect two drug combination effect immune system vitro vivo study . Preliminary study lab show combination two drug additive effect level immunosuppression growth differentiation progenitor bone marrow cell well lymphocyte proliferation . This study design test patient degree immune reactivity VGCV use combination MMF . Patients blood drawn several time point immune assay perform show VGCV use combination MMF exert immunosuppressive effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment screen subject perform 4 8 week transplantation time consent obtain . Per clinical standard care Indiana University , VGCV routinely stop 12 week post transplantation . At week 10 day discontinuation prophylaxis patient see study physician . The subject also see 2 4 week discontinue VGCV . At study visit , subject limited history physical ( H &amp; P ) perform , one 3ml light green top ( lithium heparin ) tube , one 3ml dark green top ( sodium heparin ) tube , one 5ml purple top ( EDTA ) tube obtain phlebotomy regularly schedule blood draw time . This blood use Cylex® assay , Flow cytometry MMF GCV trough level . The patient ’ complete blood count differential well drug level , medication dosage record . This information use assure Cylex® result influence change immunosuppressive drug level . The complete blood count differential use determine absolute neutrophil count . After week sixteen visit , subject complete protocol . Pregnancy test perform patient directly receive treatment secondary study . Flow cytometry perform measure absolute CD4 count , CD4/CD8 ratio , look several activation marker lymphocytes . Signed IRB approve informed consent must obtain subject prior screen assessment . The following evaluation perform prior initiation phlebotomy purpose study . Medical history include age , gender , race , renal disease , immunosuppressive regimen include dose , level use antibody treatment time transplant note . Physical examination include : vital sign , cardiac , lung evaluation . Laboratory test perform part standard care transplant : Hematology : complete blood count . Drug level : tacrolimus , cyclosporine and/or sirolimus . Evaluations treatment post treatment Patients follow surgical co-investigators throughout entire study . A limited history physical examination perform indicated schedule assessment . Clinical laboratory test Additional clinical laboratory test beyond standard care do protocol include add differential complete blood count . CBC drug level note already schedule clinic appointment post transplant protocol . Research blood level GCV MPA run 3ml lithium heparin 5ml EDTA tube research laboratory outside laboratory . Transplant laboratory test On test day additional 3ml sodium heparin blood tube drawn phlebotomy time schedule lab obtain . Flow cytometric analysis perform time list . A 5 tube panel use three color analysis perform use approximately 500_L whole blood sodium heparinized tube . The panel consist follow stain protocol Tube 1 – CD 45 FITC / CD 14 PE – Used locate lymphocyte population well determine purity specimen monocyte contamination Tube 2 – _1a FITC/ _1a PE/ _1a PerCP – Isotype control check background stain . Tube 3 – CD 4 FITC/ CD 8 PE / CD 20 PerCP – Used determine CD4/CD8 ratio well determine B cell population count . Tube 4 – CD 4 FITC/ CD 25 PE/ HLA – DR PerCP – Check specific activation marker CD 4 cell . Tube 5 – CD 4 FITC/ CD 69 PE/ CD 3 PerCP – Used get true CD4 count T-cells well look another activation marker CD4 cell . Cylex immune assay run list . This assay require minimal amount whole sodium heparinized blood use tube flow analysis . The whole blood dilute saline base diluent . It stimulate overnight phytohemagglutinin . The CD4+ CD3+ T cell isolate use magnetic bead . They lysed ATP production record use luciferase base reaction .</detailed_description>
