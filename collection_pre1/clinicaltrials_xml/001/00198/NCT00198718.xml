	<brief_summary>The ZVITAMBO PROJECT test whether give mother infant single large dose vitamin A immediate post partum period reduce : 1 . Infant Mortality Can oral administration single 50,000 IU dose vitamin A newborn infant , single 400,000 IU dose vitamin A give lactate mother , supplementation mother infant immediate post partum period reduce infant mortality least 30 % ? 2 . Mother Child HIV transmission breast feeding Can oral administration single large dose vitamin A give immediate post partum period HIV seropositive lactate woman and/or baby reduce HIV transmission via breast feeding least 30 % ? 3 . Sexually transmitted HIV infection post partum woman Can single 400,000 IU dose vitamin A give immediate post partum period HIV seronegative woman reduce likelihood become HIV infect post partum year least 25 % ? 4 . Infant feed context HIV : An operational research study initiate mid-way trial determine UNAIDS Guidelines infant feed context HIV could effectively implement measure impact program infant feeding practice postnatal HIV transmission . Substudies : Random subsamples maternal infant blood evaluate anemia iron status determine effect vitamin A hematopoiesis serum breast milk retinol ( mother ) modify relative dose response test ( infant ) determine effect vitamin A vitamin A status . A subsample maternal infant blood sample evaluate presence HLA-E , HLA-G , TAP polymorphisms relation prevalent HIV infection mother risk mother child transmission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Zimbabwe Vitamin A Mothers Babies ( ZVITAMBO ) project placebo-controlled randomized trial , enrol 14,110 mother infant within 96 hour delivery one 14 hospital clinic great Harare November 25 , 1997 January 29 , 2000 . Mother-baby pair eligible neither acutely life threaten condition , baby singleton birth weight &gt; 1500 g , mother plan stay Harare delivery . Written inform consent obtain mother . Socio-economic demographic characteristic collect interview obstetric detail pregnancy delivery transcribe hospital record . Gestational age estimate . Infant birth weight measure use electronic scale . Infant length , infant head circumference , maternal arm circumference measure . Arm circumference measure indicator maternal nutritional status rather Body Mass Index less influenced fluid fluctuation immediate post partum period . Addresses record mother 's urban rural residence ( common urban Zimbabweans travel frequently extend family rural homestead ) , place work , husband 's place work , relative would always know whereabouts . At recruitment , study nurse collect plasma serum mother baby . Maternal plasma store room temperature ( ~20° C ) sample cool box ( ~ 10-15° C ) transfer laboratory within 2 hr collection . Mother-baby pair randomize one four treatment group : mother receive 400,000 IU vitamin A ( retinyl palmitate ) baby receive 50,000 IU vitamin A ( Aa group ) ; mother receive 400,000 IU vitamin A baby receive placebo ( Ap group ) ; mother receive placebo baby receive 50,000 IU vitamin A ( Pa group ) ; mother baby receive placebo ( Pp group ) . Treatment placebo capsule appear identical contain soy oil base vitamin E preservative ( 50 IU per maternal capsule ; 10 IU per infant capsule ) ( Tishcon Corporation , Westbury , NY , USA ) . A separate team Johns Hopkins University prepare study capsule packet . Study identification number randomly allocate treatment group computer block 12 . The number print adhesive label affix amber-colored zip-lock plastic bag pack assigned capsule . Capsule packet prepare separately four treatment group , merge numeric order ship Zimbabwe series packet distribute recruitment site . As mother-baby pair recruit , capsule next sequential bag administer , associate study number assign pair . Lists link study number treatment keep sealed envelope encrypt computer file accessible Zimbabwe-based study team . Pairs follow 6 wk , 3 mo , 3 monthly 24 month one three study clinic . Home visit attempt default pair either urban rural home anywhere within Zimbabwe border . We initially plan follow HIV-positive mother infant ~50 % random sample HIV-negative mother infant 24 month . However , June 2000 , economic condition necessitate discontinue second year follow . This mean 24 % , 48 % 100 % pair reassign 24 month , &gt; 18 month , &gt; 12 month follow , respectively . Follow visit include assessment recent illness , sick clinic visit , hospitalization mother infant ; anthropometric measure , infant dietary history , maternal sexual reproductive health practice , blood breast milk sample . Free clinical care include treatment acute infection appropriate antimicrobial drug , referral government treatment facility suspect tuberculosis , counsel antibiotic treatment mastitis , oral rehydration solution education diarrhea . HIV-related psychosocial counseling available throughout study . For mother infant die , cause death determine medical record infant die hospital review verbal autopsy information study pediatrician ( infant ) study obstetrician ( mother ) , mask treatment group , infant die home . Multiple cause death permit rank hierarchically , keep recommendation expert group convene World Health Organization . Maternal plasma test HIV baseline two ELISA test run parallel , Western Blot duplicate pair ELISA test result discordant . Mothers test negative baseline retested HIV every blood sampling . Quality control monitor use kit control , inclusion internal QC sample every plate , participation quality assurance program HIV test Zimbabwe Ministry Health . Serum retinol concentration measure subsample mother baby HPLC ; quality control monitor inclusion standard provide National Institute Standards Technology ( Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) participation quality assurance program Hemoglobin measure woman enrol October 1 , 1998 end study ( 60 % total sample ) HemoCue ( Mission Viejo , CA ) . Among mother HIV-positive recruitment , CD4 cell enumerate within 48 hour phlebotomy ( Facscount , Becton Dickinson International , Erembodegem , Belgium ) , viral load measure subsample ( Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test version 1.5 , Roche Diagnostics , Alameda , CA , USA ) . Plasma cell pellet archive HIV-exposed infant visit . After follow-up complete , last available specimen infant test ( plasma GeneScreen ELISA sample collect ≥18 month ; cell pellet Amplicor HIV -1 DNA test version 1.5 ( Roche Diagnostic Systems ) sample collect &lt; 18 month ) . If sample HIV-negative , infant classify negative ; HIV-positive , sample collect young age test determine timing infection . Education counsel infant feed context HIV update throughout trial . When trial begin , information HIV transmission breastfeed scanty . In June 1998 , new infant feeding guideline publish UNAIDS/UNICEF/WHO state HIV-positive mother fully inform risk benefit infant feed alternative empower make best personal choice . In response , modify procedure provide 24-hour turn-around time maternal HIV test result . Study nurse train counsel HIV-positive woman feed option kitchen establish teach safe replacement feeding . Additional funding obtain conduct formative research inform effective program educate mother infant feed context HIV . This program include group education , incorporate infant feeding issue individual counseling , integrate mother child HIV transmission issue on-going work-site education program target men , run organization Harare . The program fully implement within trial November 1st 1999 . It emphasize exclusive breastfeed HIV-positive mother choose breastfeed , optimal breastfeed technique avoid cracked nipple , milk stasis , mastitis ; prompt treatment breast problem ; safe sex practice especially breastfeed period . These four 'safer breastfeed ' practice also promote among status-unknown HIV negative woman . Known HIV-positive woman counsel stop breastfeeding early . All laboratory analyse data management conduct Harare . The protocol interim analysis review external data safety monitoring committee . The study protocol approve Medical Research Council Zimbabwe , The Medicines Control Authority Zimbabwe , The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health Committee Human Research , Montreal General Hospital Ethics Committee .</detailed_description>
