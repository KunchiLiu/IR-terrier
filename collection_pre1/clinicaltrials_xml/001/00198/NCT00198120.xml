	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness D-Cycloserine Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project propose study efficacy safety D-cycloserine child autism . The central hypothesis project D-cycloserine efficacious reduce certain symptom autism include aspect social impairment . Autism severe neuropsychiatric disorder prevalence least 0.1 % . Despite investigation pharmacologic treatment autism , drug show consistently improve core symptom disorder , namely social communication impairment . Pilot data suggest D-cycloserine , drug affect N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) subtype glutamate receptor , efficacy symptom social withdrawal autism . In study , child autism randomly assign treatment either D-cycloserine placebo 8 week . Both subject investigator blind treatment assignment . Subjects rat variety clinical measure examine effect D-cycloserine social withdrawal symptom autism . Safety data include side-effects , vital sign , blood test , electrocardiogram perform begin end study . This study provide important information effect D-cycloserine treat core associate symptom autism . It also greatly expand knowledge glutamatergic agent autism provide crucial information regard pathophysiology future design drug study autism .</detailed_description>
