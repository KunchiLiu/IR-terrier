	<brief_title>Long Term Free Living Study With Modified Foods Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize either test group control group . Both group complete one-week run-in period follow 16 week period . This study conduct two cohort 50 participant 25 test participant 25 control participant cohort . Run-in Week – On first day , participant report laboratory initial orientation study method . Baseline body measurement , height , weight body composition analysis ( use Bioelectrical Impendance ) , fast blood sample , blood pressure pulse take . Participants also complete additional study questionnaire record . ( Table 1 provide summary measure baseline across 16 week test period ) . Participants also taste rate various fat-replaced food complete log change health next 3 day determine palatability tolerance fat-replaced food . Before try food , survey administer check common food allergy . Finally , participant instruct complete food diary 2 weekday 1 weekend day . Participants return food diary log follow week . Participants : 1 ) complete part run-in phase , 2 ) like willing eat least 80 % test food , 3 ) negative health effect follow consumption food dismiss study . No manipulation participant ’ diet occur phase . 16-Week Test Phase – During phase , test group give fat-replaced food instruct detailed diet plan create low-fat ( &lt; 25 % kcal fat ) , weight maintenance diet provide optimal glycemic control . The test group attend 1h educational session ( didactic discussion ) every 2wks . ( Appendix 2 list course topic . ) Academic professional staff lead session . Participants require keep log certain behavior food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend day 2wk period ) . Prior educational meeting , participant submit data collection sheet ( questionnaire log ) , weigh schedule measure . Following meeting , participant give fat-replaced food use next 2 week . Participants instruct keep log usage provide food , explicitly tell food use member household required return remain unused food laboratory next meeting . In addition , 8 week 16 week , blood sample , body composition , psychometrics , waist/hip measurement , blood pressure pulse take . The control group receive voucher local supermarket offset cost food provide test group give actual food . This group come laboratory every 2 week identical data collection include blood draw attend educational session . Instead , control group receive newsletter every two week importance low-fat diet management type II DM ; however newsletter give specific information use fat-replaced food low-fat diet . This newsletter send test group well . Diet The test group diet plan design weight maintenance diet derive 25 % kcal fat ( 10 % saturated fat ) . A Registered Dietitian design individually tailor , 7d rotating suggest meal plan include detailed use fat-replaced food accord optimal strategy identify Experiment 2 . The individual prescription base upon Mifflin-St.Joer equation baseline intake obtain diet record run-in week .</detailed_description>
