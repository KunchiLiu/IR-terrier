	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1 : There less tunnel-widening bone–patella tendon–bone graft compare hamstring graft fixation method use . Tunnel widen great achilles tendon allografts versus autograft bone-patella tendon-bone hamstring autograft . Hypothesis 2 : Tunnel widening occur early post-operative period ( &lt; 8 week ) tendon remodels within bone tunnel . Hypothesis 3 : Low pre-operative bone mineral density associate tunnel widening .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective study patient undergo ACL reconstruction use bone-patella tendon-bone graft , hamstring graft achilles allograft . Each group ACL reconstruction fixation use bioabsorbable interference screw femoral tibial side . Patients evaluate day surgery , 6 , 12 , 24 , 52 104 week post-operatively . Evaluations include pre-operative regional standard bone mineral density measurement , post-operative MRI evaluation tunnel dimension bone-tendon interface , radiographic evaluation tunnel dimension routine clinical follow-up . Interventions Observations - outline specific procedure , treatment and/or intervention , well source research material utilized , involve human subject human material part research project . This study require pre-operative bone mineral density measurement Nuclear Medicine Division Department Radiology HSS . Standard measurements femoral neck , spine well regional study distal femur proximal tibia injure knee perform . On day surgery , patient undergo ACL reconstruction use bioabsorbable interference screw fixation hamstring , bone-patella tendon-bone graft , achilles allograft . This standard procedure . The choice graft type ( hamstring , bone-patella tendon-bone graft , achilles allograft ) discuss patient patient decide graft type pre-operatively . In study , standardize fixation method use bioabsorbable interference screw . Post-operatively , patient undergo limit MRI scan evaluate tunnel dimension well graft placement prior discharge hospital . During patient ’ 6 week , 12 week 24 week clinical follow-up , evaluated orthopaedic surgeon clinical progress . Standard radiograph obtain patient ’ knee 6 week 24 week follow-up visit . These standard radiographic evaluation additional charge patient . We utilize image radiographic measurement tunnel expansion . During visit , patient also undergo limited MRI scan femoral tunnel tibia tunnel . With serial MRI image , able make accurate measurement femoral tibial tunnel . In addition , able evaluate bone-tendon interface well maturation intra-articular portion ACL graft . At 24 , 52 104 week patient also give standard IKDC Lysholm clinical knee outcome questionnaire objective stability measurement operative non-operative knee use KT-1000 instrument . Overall Study Protocol : Pre-operative work-up 1 . Bone mineral density measurement D.E.X.A . Day Surgery : 1 . ACL reconstruction use bioabsorbable interference screw 2 . Limited CT scan quantitate tunnel dimension 6 week post-operatively 1 . Regular clinical follow-up 2 . Regular plain radiograph quantitate tunnel dimension 3 . Limited MRI scan quantitate tunnel dimension 12 week post-operatively 1 . Regular clinical follow-up 2 . Limited MRI scan quantitate tunnel dimension 24 week post-operatively 1 . Regular clinical follow-up KT-1000 measurement 2 . Regular plain radiograph quantitate tunnel dimension 3 . MRI study evaluate tendon-bone interface , graft maturation , tunnel dimension trabecular remodel 4 . Patients answer IKDC Lysholm knee questionnaires 52 week post-operatively 1 . Regular clinical follow-up KT-1000 measurement 2 . Patients answer IKDC Lysholm knee questionnaires 3 . Limited MRI 104 week post-operatively 1 . Regular clinical follow-up KT-1000 measurement 2 . Patients answer IKDC Lysholm knee questionnaires 3 . Limited MRI Number Subjects ( power justification number ) A power analysis perform determine number subject need determine significance hamstring bone-patella tendon-bone group . Data previous study demonstrate tunnel widen 77 ± 28 % follow ACL reconstruction use hamstring tendon . We estimate 30 % decrease amount tunnel widen would clinically significant . This extrapolate 54 % increase tunnel dimension . Using estimation , power 0.80 α = 0.5 achieve use 20 subject per group ( BPTB versus hamstring ) .</detailed_description>
