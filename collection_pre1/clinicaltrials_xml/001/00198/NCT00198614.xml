Standard guideline recommend β blocker prevention AF ; however , prospective study compare relative efficacy β-blocking agent . We hypothesize carvedilol , non-selective adrenergic blocker anti-inflammatory antioxidant property , effective metoprolol , conventional β1-selective antagonist , suppress new-onset AF follow off-pump coronary bypass surgery . We design Carvedilol Metoprolol Post-Revascularization Atrial Fibrillation Controlled Trial ( COMPACT ) test hypothesis multi-center , open-label , randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carvedilol Versus Metoprolol Prevention Atrial Fibrillation After Off-Pump Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Occurring 20 % 50 % patient , postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common complication coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . Reports indicate occurrence postoperative AF associate prolonged stay hospital , readmission intensive care unit , stroke , , consequently , increase overall cost . Moreover , recent result retrospective prospective observational study suggest associate early late mortality risk high . During past decade , off-pump coronary bypass ( OPCAB ) surgery gain widespread acceptance alternative conventional on-pump CABG surgery , avoid cardiopulmonary bypass myocardial ischemia-reperfusion thought significantly reduce postoperative systemic complication . Nevertheless , recent study reveal OPCAB surgery reduce incidence postoperative AF , possibly consistent inflammatory difference on-pump CABG OPCAB surgery present begin postoperative course , partially general surgical trauma may play great role . It thus anticipate , on-pump CABG surgery , OPCAB surgery high AF-related mortality morbidity risk , prevention new-onset AF follow OPCAB surgery significantly reduce risk outcome . To date , review reflect grow consensus favor prophylactic administration β blocker . In addition , American College Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline CABG surgery recommend β blocker prevention AF . To best knowledge , however , prospective study evaluate merit specific β-blocking agent conclude agent equally efficacious . Carvedilol , non-selective beta adrenergic block agent approve use heart failure case , number ancillary activity include anti-inflammatory antioxidant property . Although exact pathophysiology new-onset AF follow OPCAB surgery yet elucidate , recent report suggest marker inflammation oxidative injury elevate patient non-surgical AF . In addition , clinical study indicate , unlike β1-selective agent metoprolol , carvedilol incremental benefit AF management heart failure patient . The anti-inflammatory antioxidant property carvedilol generate interest use prophylaxis postoperative AF . These consideration lead organization COMPACT , multi-center , randomize control trial 650 patient design test hypothesis carvedilol effective metoprolol , conventional β1-selective antagonist , suppress new-onset AF follow OPCAB surgery .</detailed_description>
