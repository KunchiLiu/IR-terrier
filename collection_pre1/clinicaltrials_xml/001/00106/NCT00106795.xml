	<brief_summary>This study examine abnormality mitochondria ( energy-producing machinery cell ) gene relate mitochondrion blood cell , muscle , fat HIV-positive patient take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) patient currently take HIV medication , compare result healthy volunteer . Many patient HIV infection take NRTIs help control infection . These medication may damage cell mitochondrion , possibly cause side effect fatigue . This study explore relationship change mitochondria relate gene patient report energy level , mood quality life . Healthy volunteer HIV-infected patient 18 55 year age may eligible study . Healthy volunteer must test negative HIV antibody . HIV-positive patient must diagnose positive least 1 year . Patients take antiretroviral therapy must take drug regimen ( least two NTRIs protease inhibitor ) least 3 month . HIV positive patient take antiretroviral medication must antiretroviral therapy least 1 year . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination , blood urine test , questionnaire relate mood energy . Qualified volunteer undergo follow procedure three four study visit : Visit 1 Complete history physical examination , blood test , questionnaire energy level , mood , quality life . Visit 2 Muscle fat biopsy : Before biopsy , blood drawn check blood count test pregnancy woman become pregnant . The biopsy do outpatient basis operating room . The site biopsy ( area upper arm upper leg ) numb injection skin . A 1-inch incision make muscle biopsied small sample muscle tissue small sample fat remove . The incision close bandage . Following biopsy , monitor 4 hour clinic . Strenuous physical activity restrict week follow biopsy allow heal . Visit 3 Examination biopsy site possible apheresis : The biopsy site examine heal . Apheresis may schedule visit extra visit biopsy final visit . This procedure obtain white blood cell study optional . For apheresis , blood withdrawn needle place vein arm white cell separate rest blood . The white cell extract red cell plasma return body second needle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Fatigue Mitochondrial Damage Patients With HIV/AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both HIV infection antiretroviral nucleoside analogue ( nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor NRTIs ) know affect mitochondrial DNA content mitochondrial function . A number important clinical syndrome observe HIV-infected person relate mitochondrial dysfunction include lactic acidosis , myopathy , cardiomyopathy , pancreatitis , peripheral neuropathy , possibly lipodystrophy . Fatigue , one prevalent complaint among person HIV infection , may also result mitochondrial toxicity , though clearly establish . Availability minimally invasive test assess mitochondrial toxicity would greatly facilitate understanding contribution mitochondrial dysfunction clinical syndrome . Mitochondrial dysfunction ultimately result lactic acidosis ; however , venous lactate measurement neither adequately sensitive specific identification early mitochondrial dysfunction . Muscle liver biopsy currently consider reference standard evaluation diagnosis mitochondrial toxicity muscle liver , invasive test impractical routine repeat evaluation . The recent development real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay accurately quantify mtDNA copy number per cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) may allow non-invasive assessment mitochondrial toxicity . This technique apply limited fashion muscle , adipose tissue liver sample well . This pilot study seek examine relationship fatigue clinical parameter marker mitochondrial dysfunction . The goal study threefold : 1 ) investigate relationship subjective fatigue rating mitochondrial dysfunction measurement mtDNA depletion skeletal muscle 2 ) determine whether relationship evidence mitochondrial dysfunction muscle evidence mitochondrial dysfunction lymphocyte adipose tissue suggest examination lymphocyte adipose tissue may adequate accurate diagnosis mitochondrial dysfunction 3 ) identify gene proteins potential biomarkers fatigue mitochondrial toxicity . For cross-sectional study , three group participant enrol : HIV positive patient NRTI-containing protease-inhibitor sparing regimen ( n=30 ) , HIV patient currently take antiretroviral medication ( n=30 ) healthy control ( n=15 ) . HIV patient NRTIs stratify accord fatigue level ( 0-3 , 4-7 8-10 ) . Participants complete battery questionnaire regard fatigue undergo muscle adipose tissue biopsy .</detailed_description>
