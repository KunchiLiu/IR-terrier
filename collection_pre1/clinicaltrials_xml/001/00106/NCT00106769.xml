	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine intend prevent West Nile virus ( WNV ) infection determine cause side effect . WNV symptom may vary fever headache , polio-like syndrome paralysis . Infection rarely result death . The vaccine use study contain DNA instructs body produce small amount protein find WNV . If body create resistance immunity protein , vaccine may protect WNV . Study participant get WNV vaccine . Healthy volunteer 18 year 50 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , include pregnancy test woman become pregnant . Patients undergo follow test procedure : - Vaccine injection : Vaccines give injection upper arm , use needleless system call Biojector 2000 . The first injection study day 0 , second day 28 ( +/- ) 7 day , third day 56 ( +/- ) 7 day . There must least 21 day injection . The pregnancy test woman childbearing potential repeat day vaccine injection . - Diary card : Participants give 5-day diary card injection record temperature symptom side effect may experience 5 day injection . The diary card return clinic visit schedule 2 week injection . Side effect symptom also must report immediately study nurse doctor , clinic visit may require examination . - Clinic visit : At day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 , participant medical history , physical examination ( need ) blood test . Vital sign weight also record . Lymph node examine day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 , urine sample collect day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 . Some blood drawn study use genetic test see different type immune response vaccine relate genetic difference people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response recombinant DNA vaccine , VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP . The hypothesis regimen safe human administration elicit immune response West Nile virus . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability humans investigational vaccine . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine . Product Description : VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP compose single close circular DNA plasmid encodes WNV viral protein precursor transmembrane ( PrM ) envelope ( E ) . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( deltoid muscle ) use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System . Subjects : Healthy adult volunteer ( 18 50 year old ) enrol . Study Plan : Fifteen volunteer enrol receive 3 injection schedule show schema . The protocol require nine clinic visit three telephone follow-up contact . Study Duration : 32 week clinical follow-up participant . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety regimen ; secondary immunogenicity endpoint ELISPOT intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) assay WNV-specific T cell response WNV ELISA assay . The principal timepoints ICS ELISPOT Week 0 ( baseline ) , Week 8 Week 12 . ICS ELISPOT study timepoints , well immunogenicity assay Week 32 , complete exploratory evaluation . Stored serum test WNV neutralize antibody assay develop .</detailed_description>
