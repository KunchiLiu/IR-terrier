	<brief_summary>This study collect data need design treatment trial patient Fabry disease use experimental drug AT-1001 . Fabry disease inherit metabolic disorder enzyme call alpha-galactosidase A , normally break fatty substance call glycolipids , miss function properly . As result , glycolipids accumulate various tissue , cause liver , kidney , nerve , skin , muscle blood vessel problem . No treatment give survey study . Males 18 year age old Fabry disease certain genetic mutation associate enhancement alpha-galactosidase A activity may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure 5 day : Day 1 Medical history physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , routine urinalysis , measurement height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) . Day 2 Blood test , 24-hour urine collection , vital sign sweat test . The sweat test ( also call QSART , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test ) measure amount sweat particular area skin . A small amount medication call acetylcholine put area skin small electric current apply stimulate sweat gland . Day 3 Blood test , 24-hour urine collection , vital sign , skin biopsy . For skin biopsy , small area skin numb punch device use remove 3-mm ( 1/8-inch ) layer skin microscopic examination . Day 4 Blood test , 24-hour urine collection , vital sign , QSART . Day 5 Blood test vital sign . In addition , patient schedule point 5-day study eye examination , brain magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) , heart examination echocardiogram . MRA use strong magnetic field radio wave provide image blood vessel head neck . It detect abnormality aneurysms , vessel malformation , thicken vessel wall . An echocardiogram ultrasound test show well heart pump blood thicken heart muscle . Patients take enzyme replacement therapy discontinue treatment 6 week ( two miss infusion ) allow accurate measurement amount alpha-galactosidase A patient 's body produce . They provide weekly blood sample time stop treatment enter study . The sample use monitor removal enzyme body possible buildup Gb ( 3 ) blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Collect Data Fabry Disease Patients With Enhanceable Alpha-Galactosidase A Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design characterize clinical laboratory profile patient Fabry disease residual level Alpha-galactosidase ( Alpha- Gal A ) activity . Normally patient later onset milder form disease , sometimes referred cardiac and/or renal variant . Enzyme Enhancement Therapy novel therapeutic approach treatment lysosomal storage disease recently propose , patient produce low level endogenous enzyme . We plan evaluate therapy later-onset Fabry disease patient preparation need develop sensitive outcome measure subset patient . Thirty patient enhanceable Alpha- Gal A activity recruit . If enzyme replacement therapy , ask miss two biweekly infusion . These patient , along five control patient non-enhanceable ( classic ) Fabry disease , undergo comprehensive five day evaluation NIH Clinical Center include complete physical examination , functional study heart , eye , kidney sweat function , image brain heart number blood urine test , well skin biopsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 old male Patients include possess AlphaGal A mutation previous investigation associate enhancement enzyme activity , judge Principal Investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients whose general health prevents participate . Patients significant disease unrelated Fabry disease ( e.g . diabetes , cancer ) . Patients refuse sign inform consent form unable travel NIH Clinical Center . Patients currently participate clinical trial small molecule gene therapy Fabry disease . Patients currently participate clinical trial condition Fabry disease . Patients judge Principal Investigator qualify participate .</criteria>
