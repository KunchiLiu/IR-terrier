	<brief_summary>This study explore clinical genetic aspect Usher syndrome , inherited disease cause deafness impair hearing , visual problem , , case , unsteadiness balance problem . Patients type 1 Usher syndrome usually deaf birth speech balance problem . Patients type 2 disease generally hear impaired balance problem . Patients type 3 disease progressive hearing loss balance problem . All patient develop retinitis pigmentosa , eye disease cause poor night vision eventually , blindness . Patients age Usher syndrome may eligible study . Patients eye hear evaluation ask send medical record research team National Eye Institute ( NEI ) review . They also ask blood sample drawn medical professional sent NEI genetic analysis . Finally , interview family history , particularly relative eye disease . Patients evaluate previously follow test procedure NIH : - Family medical history , especially regard eye disease . A family tree drawn . - Blood draw genetic study Usher syndrome . - Eye examination assess visual acuity eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina , eye movement . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) test function visual cell . Wearing eye patch , patient sits dark room 30 minute . Electrodes tap forehead eye patch remove . The surface eye numb eye drop contact lens place eye . The patient look inside hollow , dark globe see series light flash . Then light turn inside globe flash appear . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Hearing test help determine patient 's type Usher syndrome . Tests evaluate hear include examination ear otoscope , evaluation middle ear inner ear , hear test use earphone deliver tone word subject listen responds . - Vestibular test balance function . Balance test involves three procedure : Videonystagmography : This test record eye movement little camera . First patient follow movement small light . Next , wear goggles , patient lie exam table turn right leave . Lastly , soft stream air blown patient 's ear four time , ear cool air ear warm air . Rotary chair test : With electrode place forehead , patient sits rotary chair dark room . Several red light appear wall room patient follow light move back forth . Then chair turn several speed , slow merry-go-round . Vestibular evoke potential : Electrodes place behind patient 's ear base neck . Seated recline chair wear earphone , patient hears brief series loud click sound . When sound , patient ask lift head inch chair . The electrodes record information muscle neck sound enter ear .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Objectives : The Usher syndrome group clinically variable genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive syndrome . On basis clinical finding , least three type exist . Patients Usher type I bear deaf , vestibular problem , think perceive night blindness early childhood . Patients Usher type II bear hear deficit able develop intelligible speech , balance problem ; night vision problem , visual field change note later . Patients Usher type III born relatively good hearing deteriorates decade ; progressive balance problem report night blindness childhood teen . Seven gene map far Usher type I five gene identify . For Usher type II , four gene map three identify one clone gene Usher type III . Quite lot information still unknown regard genetic nature syndrome . The picture three clinical type Usher syndrome also well study point cross sectional study seem source information available far , regard natural history disease . The aim protocol well study natural history disease also make specific genotype-phenotype correlation . Study Population : A total 200 participant , include patient affect three clinical type Usher syndrome 200 unaffected relative enrol protocol . Unaffected family member , primarily parent sibling enrol provide blood sample consider helpful linkage analysis . Family member consider unaffected previous normal examination n't symptom decrease night peripheral vision . Methods : Participants undergo ophthalmologic , audiologic vestibular evaluation order clinically characterize . Blood obtain participate subject molecular study . Patients come NIH collaborate Institution participation ask provide blood sample genotyping copy ophthalmologic , audiology vestibular record , classify phenotype . Each off-site participant consent phone NEI investigator . All participant request fill questionnaire . Outcome Measures : Affected participant phenotypically categorize one three clinical type base audiology vestibular finding .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Eligible participant must : 1. document neurosensory hearing loss retinitis pigmentosa fulfill clinical characteristic USH1 , USH2 USH3 define Usher syndrome consortium . ; OR 2. unaffected family member proband Usher syndrome , primarily parent sibling . Family member consider unaffected history previous normal ophthalmologic hearing examination n't decrease night peripheral vision . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients ineligible : 1. intrauterine infection , perinatal/congenital infection , intrauterine birth complication . These condition result damage auditory visual system . 2. concurrent inherit acquire condition affect visual and/or auditory system significantly alter phenotype . Both affect unaffected individual ineligible : 1 . Are unwilling unable provide blood sample unable undergo study procedure . 2 . Are young 2 year old .</criteria>
