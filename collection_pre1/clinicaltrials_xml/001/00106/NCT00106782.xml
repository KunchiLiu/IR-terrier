	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect transcranial electrical polarization ( TEP ) , also call direct current ( DC ) stimulation , focal hand dystonia people writer 's cramp . In dystonia , muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Focal dystonia involve one part body , hand , neck face . When people focal hand dystonia make small repeat movement hand , extra activity part brain call motor cortex . TEP method brain stimulation slow activity nerve cell motor cortex . This study may help researcher develop new way treat focal hand dystonia . People 18 year age old focal hand dystonia may eligible study . Participants neurological examination randomly assign one two treatment group : TEP placebo stimulation . The TEP group receive stimulation part brain use hand movement , placebo group receive sham stimulation , affect area brain . There three TEP/placebo session period 7 10 day . The first session may last 2-1/2 hour ; two session last 1-2 hour . For TEP , sponge electrode place scalp electrical current pass scalp skull outer part brain . Before session , participant neurological examination , include evaluation rate severity movement problem . For assessment , participant write test electrical activity hand muscle record use surface electromyography ( EMG ) . For EMG , small metal disk ( electrode ) fill conductive gel tap skin muscle test . Patients follow clinic day end TEP treatment evaluation movement ability effect therapy , improvement handwriting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The treatment focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) need improvement . A deficiency inhibition demonstrate patient writer 's cramp . The passage weak DC current across head , transcranial electrical polarization ( TEP ) do many year numerous effect describe healthy subject mentally diseased patient . Recently , show objective mean , control experiment , type treatment robust lasting effect excitability motor cortex healthy human . Study population : 40 subject focal hand dystonia . Design : We hypothesize TEP beneficial effect hand write patient FHD decrease excitability motor cortex compensate deficiency inhibition . Specifically , propose look effect 2 mA TEP cathode position hand projection contralateral affect hand primary motor cortex . Anodes place orbit mastoid process ipsilateral affected hand ( contralateral cathode ) . Over two-year period , enroll 40 patient FHD evaluate acute TEP effect period 1 week ( 3 TEP session ) . Outcome measure : Symptoms evaluate kinematic analysis handwrite dystonia scale .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects focal hand dystonia 18 year old old include . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion include standard exclusion TEP well exclusion specific study . We exclude subject : Any significant medical psychiatric illness ( FHD ) . Patients positive pregnancy test exclude effect TEP fetus unknown . A urine sample pregnancy test obtain prior TEP , day first TEP session . History epilepsy . Concurrent use neuroleptic agent . Any licit illicit drug could lower seizure threshold . Metal implant . Who receive botulinum toxin injection within 10 week start protocol . Secondary hand dystonia . Mentally impaired patient capacity provide consent exclude study patient may difficulty perform required test . If participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue risk stress reason excessive fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehension . Unable unwilling refrain alcohol 24 hour prior study day . Patients may continue take muscle relaxant , artane anticholinergic drug , LDOPA dopamine agonist .</criteria>
