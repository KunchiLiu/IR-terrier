	<brief_title>Genetic Factors That Influence Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Hispanics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study concentrate genetically isolated Hispanic population high prevalence COPD live Central Valley Costa Rica . Nine hundred individual descendant Costa Rican Central Valley founder population enrol . To identify region genome likely contain genetic determinant COPD-related phenotype population , study collect phenotypic genotypic data 30 large family history moderate severe COPD multiple individual affect smoking-related airflow obstruction . A genome scan conduct individual use short-tandem repeat ( STR ) marker . Linkage analysis perform 6 COPD-related phenotype , include follow : 1 ) chronic bronchitis ; 2 ) airflow obstruction ; 3 ) force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ; 4 ) FEV1/FVC [ force vital capacity ] ; 5 ) bronchodilator responsiveness ; 6 ) total serum immunoglobulin E. Within genomic region demonstrate linkage COPD-related phenotype genome scan , narrowly space STR marker genotyped tested linkage marker COPD-related phenotype . Within select genomic region , association test single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene COPD-related phenotype . By enrol large number participant genetically isolate population utilize family-based study design , study able address important yet unstudied issue : genetic influence expression COPD phenotype Hispanics .</detailed_description>
