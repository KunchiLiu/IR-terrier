	<brief_title>Improving Functioning Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Previous work demonstrate functional limitation associate peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) diverse include slow walk speed , poor walk endurance , impaired balance compare person without PAD . Although treadmill-walking exercise improve treadmill performance patient intermittent claudication ( IC ) , treadmill performance correlate well community walk ability old men woman . In old patient population without PAD , resistance training improve function walk endurance , mode exercise sufficiently study PAD . Furthermore , although 65 % 70 % men woman PAD either asymptomatic exertional leg symptom IC , prior study assess effect exercise intervention PAD patient IC . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The randomized , control study determine whether 6-month supervise treadmill exercise program supervise low extremity progressive resistance training program , respectively , improve low extremity functioning compare nutrition control group among 150 PAD patient without IC . The investigator hypothesize participant treadmill walk exercise program participant progressive resistance training program , respectively , experience great improvement functional outcome participant nutrition control group . The primary functional outcome measure descend order importance 6-minute walk distance summary performance score . The summary performance score composite measure lower extremity function ( usual walking speed , stand balance , time require five repeated chair rise ) measure 0-12 scale predict future risk nursing home placement , mobility loss , mortality . The study also identify mechanism exercise intervention improve function PAD . Mechanisms study include change blood viscosity , calf blood flow , brachial artery endothelial reactivity , inflammatory cytokine level . By identify optimal exercise program improve function PAD patient without IC , find substantial clinical public health implication million patient PAD .</detailed_description>
