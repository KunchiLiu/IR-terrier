	<brief_title>HOPE-2 Study ( Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-2 Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain major cause mortality morbidity develop country account approximately 40 % death Canada . Reductions cholesterol , lower blood pressure smoke cessation show effective strategy cardiovascular prevention ; however , major `` classical cardiovascular risk factor '' along nonmodifiable risk factor , fully explain certain individual develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , others . Other `` emerge '' cardiovascular risk factor currently investigation . There large body consistent , biologically plausible evidence link hyperhomocyst ( e ) inemia cardiovascular risk association grade . A simple , nontoxic therapeutic intervention form multivitamins - folic acid vitamin B6 B12 - show highly effective reduce homocyst ( e ) ine level , irrespective underlying cause . To date , however , good clinical trial evaluate efficacy homocyst ( e ) ine-lowering therapy reduce major cardiovascular event . The impact simple intervention cardiovascular morbidity mortality remain demonstrate . Study Hypothesis : Evaluate long-term therapy folic acid vitamin B6 B12 compare placebo reduces risk major fatal nonfatal cardiovascular event . Importance Study : The `` homocyst ( e ) ine theory atherosclerosis '' remain important unanswered question cardiovascular medicine . If indeed combination multivitamin find effective reduce cardiovascular event , expect safe , inexpensive easily administer therapy would widely use world-wide . Therefore , result trial could significant public health impact .</detailed_description>
