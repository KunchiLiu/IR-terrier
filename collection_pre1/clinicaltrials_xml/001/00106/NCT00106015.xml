	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Diamond Blackfan anemia ( DBA ) heterogeneous genetic disorder characterize pure red cell aplasia , congenital anomaly , predisposition pancytopenia myelodysplasia well hematopoietic non-hematopoietic cancer . Anemia usually present infancy early childhood great 40 % patient least one congenital anomaly . The actuarial cancer risk , yet , undetermined . One DBA gene clone existence least two DBA gene infer linkage analysis . Penetrance expressivity DBA gene highly variable . `` Affected '' individual within family may vary dramatically degree anemia , response corticosteroid , presence congenital anomaly development cancer . Despite improvement understand disorder significant deficiency knowledge inhibit exploitation syndrome increase specific general knowledge mechanisms hematopoietic failure , birth defect cancer predisposition . Furthermore disease , near future , provide valuable platform study complex gene interaction . There less 1000 individual United States Canada estimate DBA , represent least 11 genotype . Thus , single center follow sufficient number well-characterized patient meaningful clinical laboratory investigation . Furthermore , clinician require accurate knowledge clinical laboratory presentation , mode inheritance , treatment response , outcomes prognosis make important diagnostic treatment reproductive decision . A comprehensive registry capture information characterize patient accurately therefore essential advance understand DBA , process , knowledge regard hematopoietic cell differentiation , birth defect cancer predisposition . The registry essential component clinical laboratory DBA relate research patient care . The Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry ( DBAR ) establish 1992 , family ask participate member affect disorder . From , Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation ( DBAF ) establish , largely cooperate entity family share information . The registry attempt establish contact affected individual time diagnosis , avoid pitfall report bias inherent study many disease extraordinary event prompt referral specialized center . The registry already capture high percentage estimate number new case per year , facilitate genetic study define gene ( ) responsible disorder . Thus , registry establish track record base fund non-NIH source . The study response RFA HL-04-008 Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Other Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The objective study expand update DBAR order : 1 ) facilitate investigation epidemiology biology Diamond Blackfan anemia ; 2 ) provide accurate phenotype DBA patient facilitate genotype- phenotype correlation ; 3 ) provide access well characterized patient treatment protocol ; 4 ) provide patient access research study ; 5 ) provide patient result research study ; 6 ) serve resource patient doctor guide diagnostic , therapeutic , reproductive decision .</detailed_description>
