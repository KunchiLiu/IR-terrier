	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Evaluation Inflabloc Cap Treatment Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , multi-center , dose response , efficacy safety study Inflabloc Cap patient moderately active Crohn 's disease . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety Inflabloc Cap treatment patient moderately active Crohn 's disease also elevate CRP . The study conduct approximately 20 center . Each patient undergo screen follow 8 week treatment Inflabloc Cap . Eligible male female patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio placebo , 30 mg , 60 mg DHEA administer twice daily via Inflabloc Cap approximately 60 patient complete study . Following Screening evaluation , consent patient self-administer 2 doses/day study medication ( placebo , 30 mg , 60 mg DHEA via Inflabloc Cap ) total 8 week ( approximately 56 day ) . Patients require complete daily diary containing evaluation number liquid soft stool , abdominal pain , fever general well-being . Patients also record use study drug , concomitant medication adverse event daily diary . Patients require visit study center Screening , Baseline Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 8 follow initiation treatment turn diary unused study medication , receive physical exam submit blood sample chemistry , hematology specialty laboratory measurement , urine sample urinalysis . A stool sample also require Screening culture assay C. difficile toxin . In addition , 8-week visit , patient receive exit exam include physical exam ( ECG vitals ) submit blood sample chemistry , hematology specialty laboratory measurement urine sample urinalysis . The primary efficacy endpoint study define achieve CDAI 150 less 8 week treatment . Secondary exploratory efficacy endpoint Weeks 4 8 include achieve CDAI 150 le ( 4 week ) , change CDAI baseline least 100 point , change baseline CRP , change baseline diarrhea abdominal pain sub-scores , change baseline IBDQ . Additionally , safety Inflabloc Cap administer patient moderately active Crohn 's disease elevate CRP monitor clinical evaluation , clinical laboratory data , collection Adverse Events relevant safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
