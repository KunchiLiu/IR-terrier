	<brief_summary>GPI-04-0001 Phase II , non-randomized , open label , single arm study conduct approximately 30 site , primarily United States , Europe Russia . It assess efficacy , safety , tolerability romidepsin treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Study patient ( pt ) receive romidepsin dose 14 mg/m^2 intravenously 4 hour Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle . The duration study treatment 6 cycle although pt show objective response stable disease could continue receive therapy , discretion investigator , disease progression another withdrawal criterion meet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Responses evaluate accord composite assessment ( Objective Primary Disease Response Evaluation Criteria [ OPDREC ] ) include cutaneous manifestation disease , lymph node involvement , circulate malignant T-cells ( Sézary cell ) . Skin involvement measure use weight body surface area skin assessment tool ( WBSA/SWAT ) erythroderma score , depend upon pt 's disease . Disease response assess Investigators Independent Response Review Committee ( IRRC ) IRRC assessment consider supportive Investigator 's evaluation use follow criterion : Complete Response ( CR ) : - Complete resolution skin patch , skin plaque , skin tumor , erythroderma - No evidence abnormal lymph node - Absence circulate Sézary cell . - No evidence new tumor ( cutaneous non-cutaneous ) - Findings confirm skin biopsy Clinical complete response ( CCR ) : - Same CR without skin biopsy Partial Response ( PR ) : - ≥50 % improvement summation ( change Skin + change Lymph Node + change Peripheral Blood ) - At least &gt; 30 % improvement Skin - No worsen Lymph Node Sézary cell . - No evidence new tumor ( cutaneous/non-cutaneous ) Stable Disease ( SD ) : - Not enough improvement worsen summation ( change Skin + change Lymph Node + change Peripheral Blood qualify PR PD - No evidence new tumor ( cutaneous/non-cutaneous ) SD90 : - SD90 define documented evidence SD least 90 Days Duration Progressive Disease ( PD ) : - Evidence new tumor ( cutaneous non-cutaneous ) , OR - &gt; 25 % worsen summation ( change Skin + change Lymph Node + change Peripheral Blood ) &gt; 15 % worsen change Skin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients fulfill follow criterion eligible study participation : Males nonpregnant female age 18 . Histologically confirm diagnosis CTCL , include mycosis fungoides Sézary syndrome . Patients CTCL stage IIA , IIB , III , IVA . Patients CTCL stage IB relapse follow previous therapy , investigator 's opinion , potential benefit treatment romidepsin outweigh possible risk . Patients fail standardized skindirected therapy least one course systemic therapy , interferon , Ontak® , chemotherapy Targretin® , etc. , deem fail . Anticipated life expectancy great six month . Written inform consent participate study . Patients ineligible entry follow criterion meet : ECOG Performance Status &gt; 1 . Patients receive least 1 course prior systemic therapy CTCL .
