	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B contagious virus damage person 's liver . It prevent vaccination , many HIV-positive people , vaccine help achieve adequate protection virus . In attempt improve response vaccination achieve protection hepatitis B , trial compare immune system response 3 hepatitis B vaccine regimens HIV-positive adolescent 12 24 year age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Hepatitis B Vaccination Regimens HIV-Positive Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suboptimal response hepatitis B vaccination HIV+ adult child well documented literature . Given importance prevent hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) co-infection HIV+ youth poor response rate population , study attempt improve immediate long-term sero-response rate undertake randomize , open-label trial three hepatitis B vaccination schema , follow : 1. standard adult dose HBV-only vaccine : Engerix-B 20 mcg Entry , Week 4 Week 24 2. increase adult dose HBV-only vaccine : Engerix-B 40 mcg Entry , Week 4 Week 24 3. standard adult dosing combine HBV/hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) vaccine : Twinrix 720 enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) HAV Ag plus 20 mcg HBsAg Entry , Week 4 Week 24 . This study also describe safety administration increase dose hepatitis B vaccine population . In general , patient undergoing dialysis receive dose regimen recommend immunocompromised individual tolerate vaccine series well . Design : This stratified , block-randomized , open-label trial three hepatitis B vaccination schemas HIV-infected HBV-uninfected youth . Once randomize , total 6 study visit 72 week period . Vaccination occur Entry , Week 4 Week 24 . Primary sero-response evaluate Week 28 sustainability response evaluate Weeks 48 72 achieve primary antibody response &gt; = 10 IU/ml . Primary non-responders ( antibody response &lt; 10 IU/ml ) provide booster vaccine use increased-dose Engerix-B vaccine Week 48 evaluate responsiveness Week 72 .</detailed_description>
