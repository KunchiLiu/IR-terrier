	<brief_title>Childhood Autism Risks From Genetics Environment ( The CHARGE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cause contribute factor autism poorly understood . Evidence suggest incidence increase , diagnostic change improvement may play role . Both genetic environmental factor appear play role . Autopsy study demonstrate structural change brain clinical investigation reveal neurophysiologic difference information processing autistic versus normal child . Members team recently demonstrate altered level certain neuropeptides birth child later develop autism . This case-control study first large-scale epidemiologic investigation underlie cause autism trigger regression . This study capitalize strengths case-control design , well suit examine broad array factor rare condition think multifactorial . Comparisons make general population control mentally retarded child . The aim assess influence exogenous exposure , role susceptibility factor , interplay two etiology autism phenotypic variation . Chemicals know suspected neurodevelopmental toxicity , PCB 's , certain pesticide , metal , investigate . This study pursue several hypothesis recently gain attention , include combined measles , mumps , rubella vaccine mercury present vaccine give infancy early childhood . Additionally , biochemical susceptibility examine characterization metabolic , immunologic , neuronal gene expression profile genetic polymorphism .</detailed_description>
