	<brief_summary>This study examine extent vision problem familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ( FEVR ) try identify gene responsible hereditary eye disorder . Patients FEVR incomplete formation blood vessel periphery retina ( inner part eye responsible vision ) . As result , abnormal vessel form retinal detachment vitreous bleed occur , cause significant vision loss . Vision loss usually begin childhood , gradually worsen time . Some patient eventually become blind . Patients age FEVR family member may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Family history , especially regard eye disease . A family tree drawn . - Blood draw genetic testing relate FEVR . - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Patients affect FEVR also undergo DEXA scan look osteoporosis . X-rays used scan hip , forearm spine bone density measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ( FEVR ) rare hereditary disorder retinal vasculature characterize abrupt cessation growth peripheral retinal capillary . FEVR seem exhibit significant phenotypic genotypic variability since rare disease clinical genetic characteristic disease extensively study far . Correlation phenotypes certain genotype make yet . Clinical finding vary mild disease subtle change peripheral retinal vasculature without symptom severe disease retinal neovascularization , retinal exudate , vitreoretinal adhesion , peripheral vitreous opacity , retinal fold tractional retinal detachment . The condition remarkably resemble retinopathy prematurity affect patient history prematurity supplementary oxygen use . The disorder usually inherit autosomal dominant trait family show x-linked autosomal recessive inheritance . A significant number patient autosomal dominant FEVR show linkage 11q13-q23 ( EVR1 ) . Two gene locus recently show associated disease . FZD4 , gene encodes Frizzled-4 , Wnt receptor , one . It estimate recent study 20-30 % patient autosomal dominant FEVR show mutation FZD4 . LRP5 ( low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 ) , Wnt co-receptor , recently show mutate approximately 15 % case . One large autosomal dominant pedigree show linkage 11p13-p12 locus ( EVR3 ) gene yet identify . It become obvious gene associate autosomal dominant type disease . Most patient x-linked type mutation Norrie disease gene ( EVR2 ) . The autosomal recessive form disease much rarer linkage study yet perform . Aims : The objective protocol study clinical characteristic FEVR , also assist identify location sequence correspond gene . Since one gene far identify , LRP5 , also cause osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome , inherit disorder severe osteoporosis , would also like know FEVR patient , especially mutation LRP5 also degree osteoporosis . Localization identification responsible gene help u understand pathogenesis FEVR possibly mechanism retinal angiogenesis lead potential treatment . Methods : Patients well available family member evaluate physical examination fluorescein angiography , order clinically characterize inheritance pattern family . Blood obtain participate subject molecular study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient must carry clinical diagnosis familial exudative vitreoretinopathy . Whenever patient fulfills requirement additional family member include study participant . Subjects ethnic background , gender , age , sexual orientation , health status include . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prematurity supplemental oxygen use bith cause clinical picture similar familial exudative vitreoretinopathy . The existence either factor past medical history patient necessitate exclusion study . Since fluorescein angiography crucial correct diagnosis syndrome , patient previous allergic reaction fluorescein dye also exclude . Patients inability unwillingness provide blood sample exclusion criterion well .</criteria>
