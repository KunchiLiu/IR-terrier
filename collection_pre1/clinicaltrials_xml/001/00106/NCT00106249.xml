	<brief_summary>This study evaluate clinical efficacy functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) guide 1 Hz repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) apply Supplementary Motor Area ( SMA ) OCD patient fully respond conventional therapy . The investigator collect TMS measure motor cortex excitability test whether rTMS restores normal level intracortical inhibition find deficient OCD . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Compared sham ( placebo ) , active rTMS improve symptom OCD assess Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . 2 . Active ( sham ) rTMS normalize level motor cortex excitability , reflect increased intracortical inhibition , motor threshold , cortical silent period , decrease intracortical facilitation , relative pre-treatment baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test efficacy functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) guide repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) . This study also examine measure brain function may inform u brain basis underlie OCD . Despite major advance study treatment OCD , patient often respond experience partial remission pharmacotherapy cognitive behavioral therapy . rTMS non-invasive procedure allow stimulation brain use magnetic field . Some study report rTMS may helpful reduce obsessive compulsive symptom . While promising , prior research several limitation ( e.g. , relatively small sample size , stimulation sub-optimal target area , relatively short duration treatment , lack sham ( placebo ) comparison ) . This study address drawback prior work , provide data important determine whether rTMS useful OCD patient resistant conventional therapy . In trial , 32 adult outpatient OCD , partially responsive conventional therapy , randomly assign one two treatment group ( active low frequency ( 1 Hz ) rTMS sham-placebo ) apply Supplementary Motor Area ( SMA ) daily four week . If rTMS add onto ongoing pharmacotherapy , dose must stable 3 month prior study entry . The SMA select connection area brain , especially motor area , implicate OCD . Pilot work indicate stimulation SMA low frequency rTMS beneficial OCD patient . Low frequency rTMS add benefit well safety profile ( i.e . risk seizure ) compare high frequency rTMS . Rating scale symptom change obtain baseline , rTMS course , end 4 week treatment . Patients meet response criterion four week sham partial responder either active sham offer open-label , cross-over phase additional four week daily active rTMS treatment . Patients meet response criterion either randomized phase cross-over phase continue routine clinical care supervision treat psychiatrist , invite back repeat assessment 3 6 month determine persistence benefit . Measures excitability motor cortex report abnormal OCD , may relate dysfunction motor pathway relate OCD circuit . We collect measure motor cortex excitability ( perform single pulse TMS ) baseline treatment determine whether change measure may correlate clinical improvement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary diagnosis obsessive compulsive disorder , residual OCD symptom , define total YBOCS score ≥ 16 , despite treatment adequate trial serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) , duration index episode least year include . An adequate SRI trial define treatment least 12 week SRI , meet exceeds recommend dosage level OCD ( fluoxetine 60 mg/d , sertraline 200 mg/d , paroxetine 50 mg/d , fluvoxamine 250 mg/d , citalopram 60 mg/d , escitalopram 30 mg/d ) . Individuals tolerate medication class dose specify duration described also include . Patients currently OCD medication must stable dose ( ) must continue care treat psychiatrist write prescription concomitant medication duration study . Refractory patient , treatment refractoriness define nonresponse Clomipramine , least 2 SSRIs adequate dose duration plus cognitive behavior therapy last year , exclude . An adequate trial cognitive behavioral therapy define least week 8 week clear evidence exposure session homework give . Individuals diagnose major depressive disorder ( current ) moderate severe intensity ( CGI ≥ 4 ) , bipolar disorder ( lifetime ) , psychotic disorder ( lifetime ) , history substance abuse dependence within past year ( except nicotine caffeine ) , significant acute suicide risk also exclude . Other exclusion criterion include common every TMS protocol : Individuals clinically define neurological disorder , increase risk seizure reason , history treatment TMS , deep brain stimulation disorder exclude . Patients cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease , intracranial implant ( e.g . aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth , safely remove exclude . Current use investigational drug permit . If participate psychotherapy , patient must stable treatment least three month prior entry study , anticipation change frequency therapeutic session , therapeutic focus duration TMS trial . Finally , current significant laboratory abnormality , know suspected pregnancy , woman breastfeed woman childbearing potential use medically accept form contraception engage sexual intercourse also exclude .</criteria>
