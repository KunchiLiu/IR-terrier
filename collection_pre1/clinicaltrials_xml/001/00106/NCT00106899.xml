	<detailed_description>This study test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , biological marker , clinical neuropsychological assessment combine measure progression mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The information obtain study change brain image MCI AD patient healthy individual , well assessment tool , use determine best method measure treatment effect patient MCI AD . Approximately 800 participant , range age 55 90 , recruit study : 400 patient MCI , 200 early AD , 200 normal control . Patients MCI normal control follow 3 year , AD follow 2 year . At 6-month interval , participant see person contact telephone . All participant undergo repeat scan blood urine biomarkers collect time scan . All patient ask willing undergo lumbar puncture baseline year one , goal minimum 20 % many 50 % group provide CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ) sample analysis storage future analysis . NOTE : Beginning Spring 2007 subset ADNI participant offer opportunity participate supplemental study . The PIB ( Pittsburgh Compound B ) study provide image amyloid plaque burden . PIB PET scan conduct 24 control , 48 MCI , 24 AD participant approximately 16 ADNI PET site . For enter participant previous PET FDG scan , control MCI participant scan PIB entry ( baseline ) , 12 , 24 , 36 month , AD participant scan PIB entry ( baseline ) , 12 , 24 month . For participant undergone previous ( baseline 6 month ) PET FDG scan , control MCI participant scan PIB 12 , 24 , 36 month , AD participant scan PIB 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
