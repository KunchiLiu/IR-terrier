	<brief_summary>This study explore range type medical developmental problem patient Muenke syndrome , condition result one suture bone skull close birth . Because premature closure , skull able grow natural shape ; instead , compensate growth area skull suture yet close . This result abnormally shape head , wide-set eye , flatten cheekbone . Patients may also enlarge head , abnormalities hand foot , hear loss . The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) gene , involve development maintenance bone tissue , play role Muenke syndrome . In case , FGFR3 mutation inherit parent Muenke syndrome ; case , family history disorder , mutation occur anew . A good understanding gene may lead researcher develop good treatment genetic counseling people affect Muenke syndrome . Patients Muenke syndrome blood relative may eligible study . Family member confirm Muenke syndrome genetic counseling , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Review medical record test result . - Questionnaires patient 's prenatal , birth , newborn , past medical history ; family history ; growth development ; medication ; current therapy . - Physical , neurological , ear , nose throat , dental , eye examination . - Neuropsychological test assess cognitive thinking ability . - Hearing evaluation . This include audiology test patient listen soft tone earphone ; power reflectance test chirp sound heard earpiece place entrance ear canal , possibly ABR/ASSR test , electrode attach forehead , earlobe , behind ear measure brain wave response certain condition . - MRI scan brain . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave produce detailed picture brain . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) , wear ear plug muffle loud noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . - MRI scan middle inner ear . This test similar MRI , use dye inject vein enhance image . - CT scan skull . CT use x-rays produce 3-dimensional image part body study . - Dental evaluation x-ray . - Skeletal survey ( x-rays bone body ) . - Developmental assessment IQ testing . - Blood test research purpose . A cell line may establish use future research . - Medical photograph demonstrate clinical feature , include side front view face , head , part body may involve Muenke syndrome , like hand foot . - Other consultation test clinically indicate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Muenke Syndrome ( FGFR3-Related Craniosynostosis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Craniosynostosis common craniofacial abnormality cause premature fusion one several suture skull . The prevalence craniosynostosis approximately 1 2,100 3,000 birth . Originally describe group , Muenke syndrome ( OMIM # 602849 ) specific form craniosynostosis cause single nucleotide transversion fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) , c.749C &gt; G , result p.Pro250Arg . Individuals carry define mutation variably manifest coronal suture craniosynostosis , developmental delay , deafness , carpal tarsal bone fusion . The purpose present study increase understand clinical manifestation Muenke syndrome detail physical , developmental , neurologic , dental , ophthalmologic , otolaryngologic , audiologic , radiologic , genetic/genomic study . We also plan examine spectrum clinical characteristic Muenke syndrome facilitate early diagnosis clinical management , include genetic counseling . To accomplish , plan enroll approximately 10-20 probands , well family member year , enrollment ceiling 200 probands . Our study three arm . The clinical arm major focus study . Patients family see NIH Clinical Center Children 's National Medical Center . Individuals Muenke syndrome unable unwilling come NIH , submit medical record , include copy molecular testing , review . The second arm genetic/genomic study goal investigate modify factor relate disease severity expression . The third arm consist cognitive function , development hearing questionnaire complete patient online , via phone mail .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects confirmation Pro250Arg mutation FGFR3 CLIAcertified laboratory . Our research team must receive photocopy positive test result order enroll patient study . All race gender know risk Muenke syndrome . Nationality place origin specific barrier participation . Family member ( typically parent sibling ) probands Muenke syndrome also eligible participate . Since penetrance Muenke syndrome incomplete , risk individual give option enrol research study FGFR3 testing . Those individual find carry p.Pro250Arg mutation may benefit intervention like hear screen speech evaluation would alter medical management . Variable expressivity another characteristic Muenke syndrome carrier status adequate genetic counseling important . Individuals mutation invite participate clinical and/or medical record review arm study Unaffected family member proband enrolled clinical protocol may choose provide blood sample and/or participate behavioral arm study . These information use purpose research Muenke syndrome . Patient interest case . Geneticists genetic counselor may refer individual suspect Muenke syndrome , yet test FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation . The purpose enrolling subject evaluate wider spectrum patient mutation cause Muenke syndrome . Testing Pro250Arg mutation maybe perform discretion research group . Those individual find carry Pro250 Arg mutation may invite participate clinical study arm and/or medical record review arm study . While incomplete penetrance , child eligible enrollment due lack physical finding consistent Muenke Syndrome refer hear testing , test indicate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . We reserve right exclude individual medical risk travel evaluation NIH appear outweigh benefit study participation . Description justification inclusion/exclusion participant . ( age , gender , ethnicity , prisoner , pregnant woman , fetus , decisionallyimpaired , healthy volunteer , lab personnel ) It intention remove many economic , cultural , geographic , racial , gender barrier reasonably promote participation individual Muenke syndrome family research purpose . The study include pediatric decisionallyimpaired individual , characteristic possible Muenke syndrome . Pregnant nursing woman may limit participation aspect study ( e.g . ionize radiation exposure ) . As described , Muenke syndrome demonstrate occur person different ethnic background . We would make every reasonable effort encourage enrollment participation wide spectrum individual .</criteria>
