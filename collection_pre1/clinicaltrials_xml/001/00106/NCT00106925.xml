	<brief_summary>This study provide follow-up evaluation care patient undergone allogeneic ( donor ) stem cell transplantation NIH Clinical Center . Patients monitor response treatment , disease relapse , later-occurring effect transplant . Patients 10 80 year age receive donor stem cell transplant NIH Clinical Center NHLBI protocol may eligible study . Candidates must first transplant least 3 year enter current study . Participants generally see clinic every 12 month follow procedure : - Periodic physical examination , eye examination , blood urine test . - Bone marrow aspiration biopsy : A sample bone marrow obtain microscopic examination . The patient give local anesthesia conscious sedation . An area hipbone numb , thin needle insert skin bone , small amount marrow withdrawn . - Tissue biopsy : A small piece tissue tumor obtain microscopic examination . Depending site biopsy , tissue may remove use cookie cutter-like `` punch '' instrument , needle , knife . The area numb tissue remove appropriate tool . - Imaging test visualize organ , tissue , cellular activity specific tissue . For test , patient lie table slide scanner . They may include follow : 1 . Nuclear scan use sensitive camera track small amount radioactive material ( radioisotope ) give patient mouth vein . The scan may show abnormal area tissue bone , liver , spleen , kidney , brain , thyroid , spine . 2 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use magnetic field radio wave examine small section body organs tissue . 3 . Computerized tomography ( CT ) use x-rays do different angle provide 3-dimensional view tissue organ . 4 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) use fluid radioisotope attach show cellular activity specific tissue . The fluid give vein travel cell active ( like cancer cell ) , show actively grow tumor . - Pulmonary ( lung ) function test : The patient breathes machine measure volume air person move lung . - Heart function test may include follow : 1 . Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) evaluate electrical activity heart . Electrodes place chest transmit information heart machine . 2 . Echocardiogram ( Echo ) ultrasound test use sound wave create image heart examine function heart chamber valve . 3 . Multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) nuclear medicine test use small amount radioactive chemical inject vein . A special scanner creates image heart examine beat motion muscle . Disease relapse progression , transplant-related problem may treat standard medical , radiation , surgical therapy , patient may offer experimental therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Evaluation Follow-up Care Patients Treated With Stem Cell Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While patient survive three year SCT high probability cure underlying disease , still risk several category complication could remain lifelong risk include late recurrence ( continued persistence ) original disease , late effect transplant related GVHD , immune dysfunction , consequence chemotherapy and/or radiation give transplant conditioning . Since complication iatrogenic , long term follow-up SCT patient ethical responsibility transplant team . In addition , collect data late occur complication allow prospective evaluation long term consequence survive particular transplant treatment approach ( i.e . total body irradiation versus chemotherapy conditioning , T cell deplete versus T cell replete transplant ) . This protocol design allow long term evaluation , data collection , need standard medical care patient ( appropriate stem cell donor ) receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation NHLBI protocols . This may include patient bone marrow failure state , cytopenia , hemoglobinopathy , metastatic solid tumor , hematologic malignancy . No investigational treatment administer protocol . Participation constitute promise long-term medical care NIH , provide evaluation treatment non-transplant related medical problem . This protocol provide access NIH hematologist experience care post transplant patient help transplant patient local physician manage post transplant complication . In return , data collect subject donor ( applicable ) provide NIH researcher valuable information and/or laboratory sample purpose well understand long term consequence stem cell transplantation identify area need future research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIATRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS : Patients survive three year date first stem cell transplant treat . With experimental allogeneic stem cell transplant NHLBI HB protocol Or With standard care allogeneic stem cell transplant NHLBI standard care protocol Or Selectively , allogenic transplant conduct outside NIH , subject special condition interest research team Age great equal 10 year old age less equal 80 For adult : Ability comprehend investigational nature study provide inform consent . For minor : Written inform consent one parent guardian inform assent : The process explain minor level complexity appropriate age ability comprehend . EXCLUSION CRITERIASTEM CELL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS : None , patient meet inclusion criterion eligible INCLUSION CRITERIADONOR : If appropriate clinical management recipient ongoing laboratory research would indicate need additional stem cell collection peripheral blood collection , donor may also accrue protocol provide meet follow criterion : HLA 5/6 6/6 match family donor Weight great equal 18 kg Age great equal 2 less equal 80 year old Age great equal 18 year age ( participate donor peripheral blood cell laboratory research study ) . For adult : Ability comprehend investigational nature study provide inform consent . For minor : Written inform consent one parent guardian inform assent : The process explain minor level complexity appropriate age ability comprehend . No additional stem cell harvest research purpose . EXCLUSION CRITERIADONOR ( ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ) : Pregnant actively breastfeed Donor unfit receive filgrastim undergo apheresis . ( Uncontrolled hypertension , history congestive heart failure unstable angina , thrombocytopenia ) HIV positive . Donors positive HBV , HCV HTLV1 may use riskbenefit ratio consider acceptable patient investigator .</criteria>
