	<brief_summary>This study seek define morbidity critical care polyneuropathy confirm diagnosis , fact , independently associate increased mortality . Secondary information regard reason ICU readmission patient weakness may help formulate cogent discharge strategy patient . Measurement weakness use handgrip strength may provide useful surrogate marker weakness may easily uniformly apply . Primary hypothesis : - The development ICU-associated weakness independently associate excess attributable mortality . Secondary hypothesis : - The development ICU-associated weakness associate increase need ICU readmission . - Readmission ICU result development recurrent respiratory failure insufficiency - Handgrip strength test detect ICU-associated weakness equivalent sensitivity comprehensive bedside muscle strength exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview : This study enroll patient require prolonged mechanical ventilation identify presence newly acquire weakness ICU . Eligible patient require use mechanical ventilation great equal five day , significant risk factor weakness . These patient enrol followed detect true relative mortality weak strong patient ICU . To identify patient relevant significant weakness , study identifies weakness patient survive return state normal consciousness . As patient , enrol , need screen daily awaken . Once awake assessment peripheral muscle strength perform standard bedside neuromuscular exam handgrip manometry . Initial Data Collection : After consent , demographic information risk factor neuromuscular disease patient record . Blood pressure value data regard subject ' severity illness collect . Any previous use medicine current hospitalization associate development weakness collect well . Also previous history chronic disease know associated weakness ( e.g . diabetes , immune system deficiency , end-stage liver disease kidney disease ) note . Screen awaken ( SA ) : Once daily patient assess awaken use standard ( RASS ) . When patient awake able follow command assess muscle strength exam . Medical Research Council Strength Exam : The examiner perform exam first day patient eligible RASS screening . This examiner return least twenty hour , forty-eight hour later perform repeat exam . The exam base Medical Research Council standard exam . Functions assess : Upper extremity : wrist flexion , arm flexion , shoulder abduction . Lower extremity : ankle dorsiflexion , knee extension hip flexion . Handgrip assessment : On day MRC exam patient ask perform handgrip maneuver use JamarÂ® handgrip manometer . Clinical outcome : Ventilator use , Re-intubation , Recurrent ICU admission , Tracheostomy use , ICU Length Stay Hospital LOS</detailed_description>
