	<brief_summary>Narrative medicine address therapeutic benefit derive patient form tell personal story . It offer innovative model improve health outcome . When patient cancer mark suffer writes narrative go , process may reduce pain improve quality life . Therefore , seek evaluate effectiveness write narrative pain intensity health relate quality life . We propose randomize single blind ( evaluator ) control trial . Patients cancer pain intensity least 5/10 minimum Karnofsky score 50 % randomize three group : 1 . Narrative group . Patients write story illness least 20 minute week 3 week ; 2 . Writing-control group . Patients fill pain diary week three week ; 3 . Control group . Subjects write/fill anything . Pain evaluate use numerical scale randomization weekly 8 week . We also evaluate pain interferes general activity , mood , work , relation others , sleep , enjoyment life use Brief Pain Inventory . As secondary outcome , evaluate health relate quality life , treatment outcome pain survey , modification SF 36 ( short form health survey ) , global measure well-being randomization , 4 8 week . We also evaluate emotional disclosure narrative . We use intention treat analysis . To analyze effect treatment pain intensity , quality life , well-being , employ analysis repeat measure use generalized estimating equation . We include regression model treatment group , emotional disclosure score , time , interaction treatment group time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : To knowledge randomize controlled trial ( RCTs ) evaluate benefit narrative medicine , research effect write traumatic event health outcome resemble write narrative . However , population include almost exclusively young healthy student worker , majority study perform research group . Study Population : We recruit patient cancer report pain intensity least 5/10 . We include patient still able read write . To evaluate physical ability , use Karnofsky scale . The minimum score patient need 50 % . Study Design : This randomized single blind ( evaluator ) control trial . Patients sign inform consent . Patients randomize three group . 1 . Narrative group . Patients write story illness least 20 minute week 3 week ; 2 . Writing-control group . Patients fill pain diary ( require approximately 20 minute ) week three week ; 3 . Control group . Subjects write/fill anything . Patients narrative group ask write illness affect life . We guide narrative way . The number office visit three group ; patient see weekly total 8 week . In addition , pain physician fill check list make sure presence severity symptom important patient , pain , nausea , anorexia , constipation , lack sleep address subject . We evaluate content narrative . For evaluation narrative , use Likert scale go emotional disclosure much emotional disclosure . We also count number cognitive word number positive negative emotion word . The quantitative analysis vocabulary perform text-analysis computer program . Primary Outcome : Reduction pain intensity primary outcome . Pain intensity evaluate registered nurse , aware group allocation , randomization weekly 8 week . To evaluate pain , use numerical rating scale 0 pain 10 bad pain imaginable . Secondary Outcomes : Health relate quality life sense well-being secondary outcome . For evaluation health relate quality life , employ treatment outcome pain survey ( TOPS ) modification SF-36 patient pain . Patients fill questionnaire help register nurse , aware group allocation , randomization , 4 week 8 week . For evaluation global well-being , use Likert scale go bad excellent . Patients ask global measure well-being weekly . In addition , evaluate pain interfere general activity , mood , work , relation others , sleep , enjoyment life use interference factor Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . Adherence Treatment : We call participant week remind write story , pain dairy , come office visit . Data Analysis : We use intention treat analysis . To analyze effect treatment pain intensity , employ analysis repeat measure use generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) . To determine effect exposure quality life , follow procedure describe . The outcome interest score dimension evaluate TOPS . As explanatory variable , include regression model treatment group , time , interaction treatment group time . To analyze effect exposure pain interference , employ GEE ( similar procedure describe ) . The outcome interest BPI global score , sum score one dimension evaluate ( general activity , mood , work , relation others , sleep , enjoyment life ) . If BPI global score different among group , proceed evaluate dimension separately determine one affected narrative medicine . As explanatory variable , include regression model treatment group , time , interaction treatment group time . To determine effect exposure global measure well-being , use similar approach describe pain intensity quality life . The outcome variable well-being score explanatory variable treatment group , time , interaction treatment group time . To determine impact quality narrative outcome evaluate ( pain intensity , pain interference , quality life , well-being ) include correspond regression model , addition explanatory variable ( treatment group , time , interaction treatment group time ) , emotional disclosure score . Due subjectivity emotional disclosure evaluation , two physician perform evaluation ( pain physician psychiatrist ) . We measure agreement two evaluator use Kappa statistic ordinal variable . To identify characterize patient best respond narrative medicine , include regression model describe gender , education level , age subject , interaction variable treatment group . The evaluation interaction permit u determine effect narrative medicine depend gender , education level , age patient . In addition , use latent growth curve analyse explore effect variable . To establish feasibility narrative intervention , compare number patient adhere treatment group use chi square test . Study Period : The exposure duration 3 week continue follow 5 week , total 8 week . We estimate 12 month finish recruitment follow patient need 3 month analyze data prepare manuscript publication . Sample Size : We show difference 2 unit scale 0 10 clinically important patient . To detect difference group 80 % power alpha error 0.05 , assume baseline pain intensity patient average 6 Â± 4 , estimate need 63 patient per group . To allow 10 % loss follow , include total 70 patient per group . To assure patient advanced cancer similarly distribute three group , use stratified randomization . Our measure disease severity Karnofsky scale . The cutoff 80 % . A score 80 % high indicate patient able work .</detailed_description>
