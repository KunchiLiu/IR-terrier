	<brief_summary>Rituximab man-made antibody use treat certain type cancer . This study determine whether rituximab effective treatment adult pediatric patient dermatomyositis polymyositis . Study hypotheses : 1 ) The time improvement Group A patient ( receive rituximab first ) occur significantly early Group B patient ( receive rituximab later ) . 2 ) The proportion patient improve Week 8 treatment phase significantly great Group A Group B .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rituximab chimeric , murine-human , genetically engineer monoclonal antibody direct CD20 ( cluster differentiation antigen 20 ) antigen find surface B-lymphocytes known deplete B cell administer intravenously . It approve treat non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Rituximab use autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , immune-mediated hematologic disorder . It also study use small number patient myositis . This study evaluate efficacy rituximab treat refractory adult pediatric patient dermatomyositis adult polymyositis . A patient 's participation study last approximately 45 week . At screen , participant physical exam , muscle strength assessment , electrocardiogram , blood urine collection ; also ask complete several questionnaire . All participant receive 2 infusion rituximab 2 infusion placebo . Participants randomly assign one two group . Group A receive rituximab Weeks 0 1 placebo Weeks 8 9 . Group B receive placebo Weeks 0 1 rituximab Weeks 8 9 . Each infusion give outpatient basis minimum approximately 5 hour ' time . There total 14 study visit . All participant visit outpatient clinic select time point muscle strength testing , physical exam , disease activity measurement , blood collection . During study , participant monitor closely improvement worsen disease serious drug relate side effect . Some participant ask willing undergo 2 muscle biopsy procedure , 1 prior receive study medication 1 receiving study medication , determine effect rituximab muscle tissue . If participant unable locate near-by clinical center , adult pediatric center National Institute Health locate Bethesda , Maryland fund available assist travel cost . NIH SUB-STUDY : `` Rituximab Treat Dermatomyositis Polymyositis '' - This study currently recruit patient . - Sponsored : National Institute Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) - Information provide : National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( CC ) - Expected Total Enrollment : 30 - Study start : October 2006 - Location Contact Information : Patient Recruitment Public Liaison Office ; ( 800 ) 411-1222 ; prpl @ mail.cc.nih.gov ; Phone : 1-866-411-1010 The NIH sub-study take advantage multi-center core RIM trial identify change gene expression pattern muscle , skin , peripheral blood imaging feature immunopathology muscle , skin , peripheral cell ( week 0 ) ( week 16 ) therapy . These change also correlate large number clinical , laboratory , research variable already plan collect core RIM Study . Furthermore , know specifically gene expression pattern alter resistant patient rituximab , change rituximab therapy - conjunction flow cytometry peripheral cell immunopathology tissue - help understanding pathogenesis myositis possible contribution B lymphocytes subset . Patients dermatomyositis polymyositis meet inclusion/exclusion criterion core RIM trial may eligible sub-study . The following procedure conduct addition core RIM trial procedure 13 clinic visit period 44 week : - Weeks 0 , 16 : Muscle skin biopsy ( adult ) . Small sample muscle skin tissue surgically remove examination microscope . - Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 , 44 : Skin evaluation photography . The effect disease skin thoroughly evaluate photographs rash skin around nail take . - Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 , 44 : Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . All participant MRI scan skin muscle leg . Adults also MRI examine blood flow muscle .</detailed_description>
