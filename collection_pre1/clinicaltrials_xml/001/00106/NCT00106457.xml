	<brief_title>20 Year Changes Fitness &amp; Cardiovascular Disease Risk - Ancillary CARDIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although age-related decline aerobic capacity well document , impact physical activity , body fat , genetic variation rate change well understood . In addition , little known rate change aerobic capacity early middle adulthood affect development cardiovascular disease risk factor incidence subclinical clinical cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) relate end-points . The study address issue conduct ancillary study conjunction Year 20 CARDIA ( Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ) examination , schedule take place begin June , 2005 . Approximately 3,650 ( 75 % ) survive member initial cohort African American white men woman return Year 20 exam , point 38-50 year old . CARDIA National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute-supported longitudinal study measure change coronary heart disease risk factor cohorts Black white male female 18 30 year age baseline . Also , study identifies life style age span influence change risk factor . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall goal ancillary study understand complex , longitudinal relation physical fitness , physical activity , body mass composition fat distribution , genetic factor independent interactive effect development obesity , metabolic syndrome , sub-clinical CVD . To accomplish goal , Year 20 CARDIA participant measure : 1 . Aerobic capacity , mean symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill test , use protocol use CARDIA Year 0 Year 7 exam ; 2 . Body composition fat distribution , use whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometery ( DEXA ) scan ; 3 . Physical activity , use 7 day accelerometer recording ; 4 . DNA sequence variant select candidate gene associate cardiorespiratory fitness , component metabolic syndrome , response regular exercise , use store DNA . Data ancillary study combine core CARDIA examination data address follow aim : . Examination contribution body mass composition , fat distribution , objectively measured physical activity specific genetic polymorphism variance Year 20 aerobic capacity age-related decline aerobic capacity 20-year time period young adulthood mid-life , stratify race gender . b. Longitudinal examination effect aerobic capacity change cardiovascular disease risk factor incidence CVD-related endpoint ( e.g . hypertension , metabolic syndrome , subclinical disease [ e.g . coronary artery calcium ] ) .</detailed_description>
