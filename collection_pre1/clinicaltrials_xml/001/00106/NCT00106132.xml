	<brief_summary>This study compare safety effectiveness two treatments-injections triamcinolone acetonide eye vs. standard laser therapy-for macular edema ( swell center retina ) cause blockage retinal blood vessel . Edema cause blockage large vessel call central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) . Edema cause blockage small vein call branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Triamcinolone acetonide steroid drug reduces swell ; Food Drug Administration approve injection joint muscle treat inflammatory condition . Patients 18 year age old macular edema due CRVO BRVO 3 18 month ' duration may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , blood pressure measurement , urine pregnancy test woman become pregnant . Screening also include following procedure : - Eye examination assess visual acuity eye pressure , examine cornea , lens , retina . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Optical coherence tomography measure retinal thickness . The eye examine machine produce cross-sectional picture retina . The patient seat front machine look pattern flash rotate red green light , first one eye . - Fundus photography help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Photographs retina take use camera flash bright light eye . Participants randomly assign receive triamcinolone injection standard treatment . Triamcinolone give either 1-mg 4-mg dose . Standard treatment CRVO BRVO excessive blood retina observation . Standard treatment BRVO without excessive blood laser therapy . Patients BRVO qualify laser therapy enter study may later blood clear enough permit treatment . The procedure triamcinolone injection laser therapy follow : - Triamcinolone acetonide : The eye numb anesthetic drop study drug inject vitreous , jelly-like substance locate back lens retina . Patients apply antibiotic drop home 3 day follow procedure . - Laser treatment : The eye numb anesthetic drop special contact lens place eye laser beam application . All patient follow every 4 month 3 year . Additional visit may schedule need . Patients receive triamcinolone injection also examine within 1 week injection 1 month injection . At 4-month visit patient undergo repeat eye examination fundus photography . Optical coherence tomography do visit , fluorescein angiography repeat month 4 , 12 24 . Blood pressure measure month 12 , 24 36 . Patients may retreat triamcinolone injection laser therapy often every 4 month , depend response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steroid Injections vs. Standard Treatment Macular Edema Due Retinal Blood Vessel Blockage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular edema major cause vision loss patient central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Currently , effective treatment macular edema associate CRVO . For macular edema associate BRVO , grid laser photocoagulation may effective treatment , many patient derive limited benefit treatment . Therefore , development new treatment modality treat macular edema cause two condition important research goal . The Standard Care vs. COrticosteroid REtinal Vein Occlusion ( SCORE ) Study compare efficacy safety standard care intravitreal injection ( ) triamcinolone acetonide treat macular edema associate CRVO BRVO . The SCORE Study design multicenter , randomize , Phase III trial compare efficacy safety standard care versus triamcinolone acetonide injection ( ) treatment macular edema associate CRVO BRVO . In two disease area , 630 participant randomize 1:1:1 ratio one three group : standard care , intravitreal triamcinolone 4 mg , intravitreal triamcinolone 1 mg. For CRVO participant , standard care consist observation macular edema . For BRVO participant , standard care consist immediate grid laser photocoagulation study eye without dense macular hemorrhage . For study eye BRVO participant dense macular hemorrhage , standard care observation follow grid laser photocoagulation clear hemorrhage permit grid laser photocoagulation . For three group , neovascular complication treat necessary . Repeat treatment provide clinically indicate base protocol-specific guideline . Participants follow 3 year randomization . The primary efficacy outcome study improvement 15 letter baseline best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score 12-month visit . Secondary efficacy outcome include change baseline efficacy outcome assessment visit best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score , change retinal thickness center macula change area retinal thickening assess stereoscopic color fundus photography , change retinal thickness calculate retinal thickening assess optical coherence tomography . Safety outcomes include injection-related adverse event infectious endophthalmitis , non-infectious endophthalmitis , retinal detachment , vitreous hemorrhage steroid-related adverse event , include cataract elevated intraocular pressure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : General Ability willingness provide inform consent . Sex : Participants may male female . Age : 18 year old Ocular Inclusion Criteria ( study eye ) : A . Participants must centerinvolved macular edema secondary either CRVO BRVO . Eyes may enrol macular edema document least 3 month longer 18 month ( patient history ophthalmologic diagnosis ) . The following definition use purpose SCORE Study : A CRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence retinal vein occlusion ( e.g . telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate venous system ( previously dilate venous system ) 4 quadrant . A BRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence retinal vein occlusion ( e.g . telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate venous system ( previously dilate venous system ) 1 quadrant less retina drain affected vein . A hemiretinal vein occlusion ( HRVO ) define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence retinal vein occlusion ( e.g . telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate venous system ( previously dilate venous system ) 1 quadrant less 4 quadrant . Typically , HRVO retinal vein occlusion involve 2 altitudinal quadrant . For purpose SCORE Study , eye HRVO treat eye BRVO analyze BRVO group . B. ETDRS visual acuity score great equal 34 letter ( approximately 20/200 ) less equal 73 letter ( approximately 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol screen visit . C.
