	<brief_title>Autoimmunity Coronary Artery Disease - Ancillary CARDIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Connective tissue disease identify risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Patients connective tissue disease rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus high prevalence CAD younger expect onset CAD . It propose association connective tissue disease CAD related inflammation . Furthermore , circulate autoantibody identify CAD hypothesize CAD may autoimmune feature . Circulating autoantibody exist prior connective tissue disease development presence autoantibody asymptomatic individual predictor future clinical connective tissue disease . Although association connective tissue disease CAD establish , association pre-clinical circulating autoantibody early CAD yet explore . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To test hypothesis , follow specific aim propose use CARDIA database : 1 ) Determine association autoimmunity measure store sera collected 1992 subsequent development sub-clinical CAD measure 2000 2005 . 2 ) Assess whether autoimmunity measure 1992 predict future increase level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) whether relationship autoimmunity CAD mediate CRP level . These aim accomplish team investigator within Division Rheumatology Department Preventive Medicine Northwestern University . The CARDIA database product Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study , prospective cohort 5108 subject follow since 1985 development novel cardiac risk factor . With extensive epidemiologic database store serum collect serially available 3500 individual past 20 year , CARDIA study ideal resource study .</detailed_description>
