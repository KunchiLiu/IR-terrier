	<brief_summary>This study examine whether new drug call acamprosate helpful alcohol withdrawal , result drinking high amount alcohol long periods time . Alcohol withdrawal cause various symptom , include nausea vomiting , anxiety depression , tremor , high blood pressure , others . During withdrawal , brain chemical call neurotransmitter change , rise abnormally high level . These change may contribute alcohol craving , drink relapse impaired mental performance . This study see take acamprosate 4 week low level neurotransmitter , glutamate , lessen withdrawal symptom decrease alcohol crave brain damage associate withdrawal . Healthy normal volunteer alcohol-dependent patient 21 65 year age may eligible study . Participants admit hospital 28 day . They receive standard inpatient care alcohol detoxification , include medical history physical examination , neurological evaluation , laboratory test , nursing , nutrition , discharge planning referral treatment concomitant condition , need . In addition , randomly assign take either two acamprosate two placebo pill three time day 28 day undergo follow test procedure : - Days 1-28 : Drug treatment . Patients take acamprosate placebo daily . Patients severe withdrawal symptom may also receive diazepam ( Valium ) . Throughout hospitalization , patient fill questionnaires emotional state personality interview staff mental health , use alcohol , cigarette , illicit drug , employment , support system family social relationship , legal status . - Days 2 3 : Blood test . Blood test level stress hormone cortisol ACTH , release excess alcohol withdrawal . For test , heparin lock ( thin , flexible plastic tube rubber stopper end ) place arm vein blood collection day 6 AM , 12 noon , 6 PM 12 midnight . Patients rest bed 30 minute collection . - Day 4 : Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . These procedure do time . They use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change brain . The patient lie table space enclose metal cylinder ( scanner ) 20 30 minute test . - Day 5 : Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . A local anesthetic give numb area procedure . Then , needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . - Days 5 6 : Dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) test . This test measure effect alcohol withdrawal ACTH cortisol . The patient take standard dose steroid dexamethasone 11 PM day 5 . At noon next day , give lunch stay bed rest . A plastic tube put arm vein . A salt water solution slowly infused catheter blood sample withdrawn . At 3 p.m. , patient give 100 microgram hormone CRF . Repeated blood sample obtain measure ACTH cortisol . - Days 23-27 : All test do day 2-6 repeated , except MRI . MRS repeat measure neurotransmitter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Clinical well preclinical study indicate process develop alcohol dependence recruit progressively aggravate hyperglutamatergic state , turn key signal emotional dysregulations lead crave relapse , well neurotoxicity lead cognitive impairment loss grey matter alcoholic patient . Acamprosate recently approve relapse prevention sober alcoholic , effect mediate largely unknown mechanism . Preclinical data indicate , however , might primarily useful target hyperglutamatergic state develops recur withdrawal episode , halt process describe . If , acamprosate might value withdrawal treatment prevent progression alcohol dependence . The aim present protocol evaluate , randomize control trial , effect acamprosate withdrawal early post-withdrawal phase . The primary outcome variable central glutamate/glutamine concentration determine MR spectroscopy . A number exploratory biological clinical measure addition obtain use secondary analysis specify . Study Population : We study patient age 21 - 65 , without gross impairment judgment complicate psychiatric morbidity , go withdrawal high probability , admit inpatient NIAAA CC-unit . A group healthy volunteer receive study medication examine separately order confirm hyperglutamatergic state present patient withdrawal . Design : All patient receive standard care alcohol detoxification . In addition , half randomize blinded fashion oral acamprosate , two 333 mg tablet take 3 time daily correspond placebo . Validated rating scale ( CIWA-Ar , CPRS-SA ) use assess intensity withdrawal psychopathology . If severity withdrawal exceeds predefined criterion , standard diazepam treatment add study medication . The accrual target base primary analysis sample patient require diazepam medication , potential confound . A secondary analysis carry complete sample , analyze requirement for/amount diazepam supplement secondary outcome variable . Outcome Measures : A battery test obtain 1st 3rd week inpatient treatment . These include NMR-spectroscopy quantify central level excitatory inhibitory amino acid ( primary outcome variable : GluX concentration ) ; lumbar puncture obtain CSF analysis neurotransmitter/neurohormone metabolites synaptic protein . Repeated 4 x daily blood collection analysis serum cortisol ACTH obtain assess spontaneous activity circadian variation HPA-axis , combine dexamethasone - CRH test carry dynamically probe system , gauge sensitivity feedback inhibition .</detailed_description>
