	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize non able-bodied participant report acute , sub-acute , chronic symptom neck back pain musculoskeletal origin magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , X-ray blood parameter demonstrate statistical difference “ normal ” ( able-bodied ) volunteer . Muscle pattern recognition ( MPR ) test show statistically different result group . This statistically significant find MPR result enhance clinician ’ determination clinical normality abnormality . If hypothesis demonstrate , MPR modality first quantitative tool develop assist diagnosis presence absence musculoskeletal dysfunction patient population . The availability evaluation tool healthcare provider patient soft tissue , non-surgical neck back complaints substantially improve accuracy diagnosis case management decision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Demonstrate That Muscle Pattern Recognition ( MPR ) Effective Evaluation Tool Musculoskeletal Neck Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators aim use data able-bodied non able-bodied sample create normative database technology . The primary objective populate normative database construct reliable valid normative database representative North American population use discriminative analysis tool differentiate abnormal musculoskeletal function normal musculoskeletal function . Study Population : The study population compose 480 asymptomatic participant ( able-bodied individual ) symptomatic ( non able-bodied individual : individual musculoskeletal , non-surgical injury neck back ) select first basis screen questionnaire . Upon sign informed consent participate study , participant complete screening questionnaire . They independently evaluate two clinician , well experienced field musculoskeletal medicine , obtain detailed medical history particular attention strict inclusion/exclusion criterion perform standardized physical examination . This standardized clinical examination consist current “ Gold Standard ” . Most patient present musculoskeletal complaint back neck frequently give diagnosis solely basis “ first line ” healthcare provider ’ history physical examination . To ensure statistical strength history physical selection process inclusion study , participant undergo two separate clinical examination . Each perform independently physicians specialist two different field practice commonly see neck back pain patient must agree subject clinically normal . If select continued participation , participant undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) spine ( sagittal view entire spine ) , plain X-rays entire spine ( A/P Lateral view ) , blood study ( CBC , Sedimentation Rate , CPK , Calcium , Phosphorous , Pregnancy test , drug screen ) MPR test . A total 480 clinically lab normal able-bodied/not-able bodied individual select examined period twelve month 4 different center . Able-Bodied Participants : A total approximately 240 able-bodied participant divide gender ( male , female ) age class : specifically [ 18-30 year ] , [ 31-45 year ] , [ 46-62 year ] . This sample size select , part , Edgerton et al . report recruitment pattern neck back differ dependent upon gender goal population approximately 120 male 120 female . At close study , investigator segment population three age group mention , propose sample size think appropriate statistical analysis still capture variety subject type . The overall age range choose represent main work population North America , exceed upper age range muscle recruitment pattern may vary natural evolutionary basis . The total number normal/able-bodied participant collect 4 independent research center U.S. Canada expect maximum approximately 60 individual per center . A sub-group 32 randomly assign able-bodied volunteer schedule second MPR test approximately 7 day initial test examine reliability MPR evaluation tool . In selection process , every effort make avoid bias toward non-working population ( i.e . test morning afternoon ) obtain representative proportion age race class exist North America . Not Able-Bodied Participants : Investigators aim construct valid reliable profile clinically normal individual diagnose suffer musculoskeletal neck back pain use confirm hypothesis ability MPR evaluation provide valid , reliable , objective information clinician . These 240 able-bodied volunteer select use inclusion/exclusion criterion standardize medical history physical examination . One exception exclusion criterion not-normal participant us ongoing medication control discomfort , leave discretion investigator individual ’ medication profile may affect pain reporting , physical performance , compliance protocol step . A 3-day medication “ wash-out ” allow ( encourage ) concern participant ’ performance . In order conduct appropriate discriminate analysis , half recruit participant able-bodied sample participant . Half participant fall able-bodied participant sample . Every effort make selection process avoid bias toward non-working population ( i.e . test morning afternoon ) obtain representative proportion age race class exist North America . During data collection process , clinical category could define additional statistical analysis locus symptom ( i.e . lumbar , thoracic , cervical ) , level symptom ( low , mid , upper back ) laterality symptom ( left right ) . Upon analysis laboratory image finding ( MRI , X-ray , blood test ) anatomic finding variation degenerative disc disease , size possible disc protrusion , Sedimentation Rate CPK value , Schmorld ’ node , etc . may also discuss . Not able-bodied volunteer may long stand back neck pain pain symptom recently several day date injury . This immediate window pain allow include acute event unless individual able perform nine movement necessary MPR test procedure . The out time duration pain choose include individual chronic complaint , compensatory secondary gain issue appear present may occur Worker ’ Compensation claim , disability claim , litigation . It desire investigator include appropriate acute , sub-acute , chronic neck back pain sufferer . We believe design study prove evaluation provide MPR test modality tool choice objective evaluation case management patient present musculoskeletal , non-surgical neck back pain differentiate “ normal ” ( asymptomatic , able-bodied ) individual individual ( “ normal ” ) underlie biomechanical dysfunction .</detailed_description>
