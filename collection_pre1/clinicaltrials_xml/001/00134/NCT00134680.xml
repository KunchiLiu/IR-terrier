	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect ( good bad ) combination drug letrozole ( also call Femara™ ) trastuzumab ( also call Herceptin® ) breast cancer . The United States ( US ) Food Drug Administration approve letrozole Herceptin treatment advance breast cancer . Doctors hope combination work well either drug alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since ER function regulate peptide growth factor signal , phenotype ER positive tumor may influence expression growth factor growth factor receptor . A potential interaction ErbB2 ( HER2/neu ) expression success endocrine therapy examine . ErbB2 expression show correlate resistance hormone therapy . An inverse relationship endocrine therapy responsiveness ErbB2 expression observe study . This may due discordant ER status primary tumor metastatic site . ER status discordant approximately 20 % case , tendency metastatic disease become ER negative time . Data concern ErbB2 limit , may similar lack concordance primary tumor metastasis . Inhibition ErbB2 signal may slow development resistance estrogen deprivation therapy inhibit pathway promotes estrogen independent growth . The ErbB2 signal transduction pathway bypass requirement estrogen breast epithelial cell growth . When ErbB2 activate ER positive breast cancer cell vitro , ER become phosphorylated capable stimulate transcription without estrogen . Chronic activation heregulin , ligand ErbB family receptor , lead ER down-regulation acquisition ER negative phenotype . Estrogen deprivation therapy selective aromatase inhibitor ( SAIs ) become standard care postmenopausal woman tamoxifen-resistant advanced breast cancer . About 1/3 patient benefit therapy . There interest treat endocrine therapy refractory breast cancer recombinant DNA-derived humanize monoclonal antibody trastuzumab . When give alone , trastuzumab endocrine therapy-like risk benefit ratio . Trastuzumab target ErbB2 ( HER2/neu ) . Some breast cancer may coexpress ER ErbB2 . Letrozole ( Femara™ ) highly selective oral non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor . According vitro data , letrozole 170-fold potent inhibit aromatase aminoglutethimide ( AG ) 19-fold active anastrozole . Letrozole effectively inhibit intratumoral aromatase accord vitro vivo data . It indicate treatment advance breast carcinoma post-menopausal woman fail prior anti-estrogen therapy . Final FDA approval grant 1997 . In two randomized phase IIb/III study patient previously treat antiestrogen , 19.5 % 23.6 % patient achieve objective response letrozole 2.5 mg/day compare 12.4 % receive AG 16.4 % patient receive megace . Median overall survival increase letrozole 2.5 mg/day group 8 month compare AG 3 month compare megace . The low 0.5 mg/day dose letrozole associate poor response rate overall survival study . Trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) approve 1998 . A trial trastuzumab single agent first line treatment advance disease report . Response rate first 62 patient 24 % . The primary objective trial determine proportion patient ER and/or PR positive , ErbB2 positive tamoxifen resistant metastatic breast cancer achieve complete remission partial remission significant change lesion size &gt; 24 week combination letrozole trastuzumab . The study also determine duration response median time progression , evaluate toxicity , generate tumor serum bank , analyze ErbB2 expression circulate malignant cell treatment . The study enroll 35 patient</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal . If premenopausal diagnosis , eligible undergoes treatment luteinising hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist surgical ovarian ablation initiate treatment ( tx ) . Tumor cell expression ER and/or PR ErbB2 . Expression ascertain either primary metastatic site . Patient may receive adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patient receive adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy , tx . must discontinue 4 week patient must recover acute toxicity , except alopecia . Prior radiotherapy permit long plan start study medication complete within 3 week start trial medication . Prior megestrol acetate raloxifene therapy permit , must stop prior trial entry . Prior tamoxifen therapy . At least one bidimensionally measurable lesion . ECOG performance status 02 . Patient life expectancy 6 month . Patient must adequate hematologic function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1000/mm3 ; platelet 75,000/mm3 . Patient must adequate renal liver function , define : serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ; serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( three time upper limit normal patient hereditary benign hyperbilirubinaemia ) ; transaminase ( ALT , AST ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal patient without liver metastasis , less equal 5 time upper limit normal patient liver metastasis . Ejection fraction multiplegated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram great 50 % Patient must give write informed consent prior initiation invasive studyrelated procedure would otherwise perform , must able comply schedule visit evaluation . Treatment bisphosphonates trial permit . Prior exposure aromatase inhibitor ( aminoglutethimide , formestane anastrozole , letrozole exemestane ) 28 day . Patients already start aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) eligible protocol meet eligibility requirement receive load dose trastuzumab 28 day start AI therapy . Patients initially receive anastrozole exemestane switch letrozole . Prior treatment trastuzumab Prior anthracycline exposure adjuvant set &gt; 360 mg/m2 . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement metastatic breast cancer life threaten lymphangitic large volume lung liver disease . Patient 's qualify lesion previously irradiate schedule irradiation follow study entry . Severe uncontrolled concomitant disease cause . More 1 prior course chemotherapy metastatic disease . If patient receive one course palliative chemotherapy , acute toxicity must resolve patient must experience progressive disease time enrollment . ECOG performance status 3 4 . Patient previous malignancy breast cancer except : adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix ; localize basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ; previous malignancy treat curative intent recurrence risk le 30 % . Patient unable understand inform consent unlikely compliant protocol .</criteria>
