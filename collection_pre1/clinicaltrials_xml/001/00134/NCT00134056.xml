	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , prednisone , atrasentan work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether docetaxel , prednisone , atrasentan effective docetaxel prednisone treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study docetaxel , prednisone , atrasentan see well work compare docetaxel prednisone treat patient stage IV prostate cancer bone metastases respond previous hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0421 , Docetaxel Prednisone With Without Atrasentan Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases That Did Not Respond Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare survival progression-free survival patient hormone-refractory stage IV prostate cancer bone metastasis treat docetaxel prednisone combine either atrasentan v placebo . Secondary - Compare pain progression patient treat regimen . - Compare qualitative quantitative toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life , term palliation metastatic bone pain improvement functional status , patient treat regimen . - Compare prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare objective response patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Determine whether 30 % reduction PSA slope PSA baseline 3 month surrogate marker survival patient treat regimen . - Correlate PSA progression clinical progression death patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease progression ( measurable non-measurable disease progression v prostate-specific antigen progression ) , use bisphosphonates study entry ( yes v ) , bad pain , measure Brief Pain Inventory `` pain '' scale ( &lt; grade 4 v ≥ grade 4 ) , extraskeletal metastasis ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oral atrasentan oral prednisone daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course . Patients stable respond disease course 12 may register continued oral atrasentan treatment 52 week absence disease progression* unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel prednisone arm I . Patients also receive oral placebo daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course . Patients stable respond disease course 12 may register continued oral placebo treatment 52 week absence disease progression* unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients PSA progression alone allow continue treatment Quality life assess baseline , course 4 , 7 , 10 , completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 930 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
