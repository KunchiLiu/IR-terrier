	<brief_title>A Study Docetaxel Plus Carboplatin Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive carboplatin docetaxel . This treatment give outpatient department every 3 week ( call one cycle ) . One day prior day chemotherapy , patient give steroid drug ( dexamethasone ) take twice day 3 day . This help decrease risk allergic reaction . On day chemotherapy , docetaxel carboplatin give vein two three hour . Docetaxel give carboplatin . In addition , patient receive zofran , anti-vomiting agent , try prevent nausea vomit . Study participant also give prescription anti-nausea pill take home . After cycle treatment , patient require get blood check ( day 8-12 cycle ) . This may do outside laboratory closer patient 's home . Treatment repeat every three week provide blood test physical examination do prior treatment acceptable . If patient able receive next schedule dose chemotherapy , doctor delay treatment week maximum two week , beyond , patient take trial . If delay one week study participant significant side effect , doctor decrease dose carboplatin docetaxel . During treatment period , doctor may also prescribe medication treat low red blood cell low white blood cell . Before cycle ( every 3 week ) , routine blood test draw ( 3 teaspoon ) monitor bone marrow , liver , kidney function . These sample look two protein blood may help u predict respond docetaxel carboplatin . We also obtain CT scan every 3 cycle treatment end study . A bone scan also do every 3 cycle evidence bone involvement first bone scan . A bone scan may also order study patient without prior evidence bone involvement doctor suspect cancer spread bone .</detailed_description>
