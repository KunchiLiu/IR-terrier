	<detailed_description>Seniors consume large proportion health care resource Canada . It recognize significant proportion senior 75 year age risk functional decline , thus institutionalization death . A recent meta-analysis nineteen study preventive primary care outreach intervention older person find intervention associate significant reduction mortality ( Summary Odds Ratio [ OR ] 0.83 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.75 0.91 ) increase likelihood living community ( OR 1.23 , 95 % CI 1.06 1.43 ) . While four nineteen study conduct Canada , none examine health-related quality life cost effectiveness intervention . The study conduct randomize controlled trial preventive primary care outreach service provide high risk senior live community . The goal service identify unrecognized problem individual increase risk link individual care . This preventive primary care service provide nurse case manager .

The sample include senior age 75 identify risk accord Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire . We recruit 640 patient study randomly allocate intervention control group . A research assistant , blind group allocation , collect data senior baseline , six month , end one year . Outcome measure include health-related quality life ( quality adjust life year [ QALYs ] ) , health social service utilization cost , mortality , institutionalization , functional status , perceive health status . Primary Hypothesis : The intervention compare usual care result high health-related quality life . Secondary Hypotheses : Compared usual care , PPCO intervention result : - low cost associated service utilization ; - less functional decline ; - reduce mortality ; - low rate institutionalization ; - well self-rated health . The available evidence regard effectiveness economic impact primary care intervention senior inadequate development health care policy Ontario Canada .
