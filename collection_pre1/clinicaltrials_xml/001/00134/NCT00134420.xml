	<brief_summary>We , investigator University Texas Health Science Center San Antonio , want learn height IQ ( intelligence quotient ) score improved growth hormone ( GH ) treatment child chromosome 18 deletion abnormal growth . Data previous study show growth hormone improve height child 18q- growth hormone deficiency . In addition , study participant growth hormone treatment show increase IQ score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Chromosome 18q- Abnormal Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS : Our hypothesis reference child 18q deletion abnormal growth : - growth hormone improve growth ; - growth hormone improve performance IQ ( pIQ ) . Therefore , specific aim evaluate impact GH treatment : - linear growth child 18q deletion abnormal growth classically growth hormone deficient ; - pIQ child 18q deletion abnormal growth GOALS AND METHODS : We already investigate growth axis 50 individual cytogenetically molecularly confirm 18q deletion determine height , growth velocity , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) , IGF bind protein 3 ( IGFBP3 ) , bone maturation growth hormone ( GH ) response pituitary stimulant ( clonidine arginine ) . To summarize : child 18q deletion short : 64 % height 2 S.D . mean . Affected child also grow slowly : 68 % growth velocity 1 S.D . mean . Half individual delay bone maturation . Growth factor skew downward : 72 % IGF1 value 83 % IGFBP3 value average normal child . Similarly , 72 % child fail adequately respond GH stimulant . In total group 50 child , 20 ( 40 % ) classically GH DEFICIENT ( height &lt; -2 S.D. , velocity &lt; -1 S.D. , bone age &lt; -2 S.D. , IGF1 &lt; -1 S.D. , IGFBP3 &lt; -1 S.D. , peak GH &lt; 10 ng/ml polyclonal GH assay ) GH treatment . Of remain 30 child , 28 multiple abnormality growth axis , primarily growth velocity &lt; -1 S.D . ( ABNORMAL GROWTH ) , qualify GH treatment accord criterion set private insurer . Almost child abnormality suggestive hypothalamic dysfunction involve TSH ( thyroid stimulate hormone ) prolactin . None CNS ( central nervous system ) abnormalities pituitary MRI . Thus suspect many child neurosecretory dysfunction . Parental height slightly average ( father ( height standard deviation score ) HTZ = 0.3 +/- 1.2 , mother HTZ = 0.1 +/- 1.1 ) none child overweight . Of 8 child GHD ( growth hormone deficiency ) prolong GH treatment , growth rate comparable report NCGS ( National Collaborative Growth Study ) idiopathic GHD 1 2 year . The mean change height 28-month period treat group study +1.8 S.D . -0.25 S.D . untreated group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . No known complication GH treatment encounter . Furthermore , association 18q deletion , hypomyelination cognition , non-statural benefit GH treatment examine : specifically , performance intelligence quotient ( pIQ ) measure use detailed battery neuropsychological instrument . The pIQ measure many child hear impaired full scale IQ , rely verbal skill , would underestimate ability . The GH-treated group compare untreated group . The GH-treated group ( n=8 ) show increase pIQ 23 point ( range 0 +47 ) untreated group ( n=6 ) show change ( range -2 +6 ) ( p=0.003 ) . Based observation , conclude GHD child 18q deletion respond favorably GH therapy term linear growth pIQ . In contrast , child 18q deletion abnormal growth classically GH deficient , show little change height S.D . pIQ time . Therefore , propose study ( NEW STUDY ) whether child 18q deletion abnormal growth benefit GH treatment . For purpose proposal , abnormal growth define growth velocity &lt; -1 S.D . Initial auxology , endocrine testing , neurocognitive evaluation perform Center . Auxologic neurocognitive testing repeat 18 month therapy Center . These study do Center assure consistency evaluation , particular concern neurocognitive test . Many child also participate study Center ( MRI imaging , psychological evaluation family function ) part application . Children begin GH treatment need see pediatric endocrinologist dosage adjustment 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . The untreated child also need see pediatric endocrinologist auxologic study time point . We enrol 20 child study . Few child locate single geographic area ; therefore , 12-20 center see individual child . Rather develop new form , standard NCGS intake form use intermediate visit local pediatric endocrinologist . Control Group : We 20 previously study child , 5.3 +/- 2.8 year age , abnormal growth never receive GH . All undergone extensive auxologic , hormonal , neurocognitive neuroimaging evaluation . These study do 15.4 +/- 9 month ago ( range 11-28 month ) . We already show , absence intervention , height S.D . pIQ stable time ; therefore , child serve control . We also 20 child GH deficient treatment participant another study . These child evaluate prior initiation treatment . All scheduled re-evaluated least twice five-year period . The data first 8 treated child report . These child serve important `` disease control '' . NAME OF FDA APPROVED DRUG TO BE USED : We use Nutropin AQ study . METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT : All child previously evaluate Center offer opportunity receive GH , subject follow limitation : - The prior evaluation must occur least 12 month precede anticipated date initiation GH therapy . - May GH treatment previously treat GH - Growth velocity &lt; -1 S.D . normal weight length/height - Must willing return Center reevaluation auxologic parameter neurocognitive test prior initiation GH therapy . - Must willing administer GH daily basis 12-15 month - Must willing return Center re-evaluation 12-15 month therapy . The majority 20 patient study come group child previously evaluate . New child ( family ) see initial visit Center , offer opportunity participate clinical trial abnormal growth classically GHD . However , child randomly assign either treatment non-treatment initial 12-month period . Both treat untreated child ( family ) must comply limitation 2-6 . The minority 20 patient study come group child new . TYPE OF RANDOMIZATION : Randomization apply child new Center . When result growth factor GH provocative test know , two-step process occur . Children , GHD , start GH enter on-going study already underway Center . They qualify participation propose NEW study . Children abnormal growth assign either treatment non-treatment category , use adaptive randomization scheme avoid imbalances number subject allocate two group . PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS : GH-treated child see 3 , 6 , 9 12 month local pediatric endocrinologist measurement height weight , review medical history dosage adjustment . Untreated child see 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month measurement height weight review medical history .</detailed_description>
