	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid work treat patient metastatic and/or locally advance locally recurrent thyroid cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Treating Patients With Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced Locally Recurrent Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient metastatic and/or locally advance locally recurrent thyroid cancer treat suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluate disease response . Patients achieve complete response receive additional 2 course SAHA . Patients achieve stable disease partial response receive 4 additional course SAHA . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 4 week .</detailed_description>
