	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease single important killer Canadians . Despite major advance therapy , still significant proportion patient identified disease die current treatment approach effectively palliate condition . A new treatment modality call therapeutic angiogenesis appear clinical research scene last five year ; approach recreate natural process new blood vessel formation observe growth development every human . It extremely potent promise modality , far result clinical trial patient equivocal . One reason limit efficacy observe thus far therapeutic angiogenesis may rest factor produce line coronary artery essential angiogenic substance take effect heart muscle patient severe coronary artery disease . These patient , however , virtually , result disease , mark dysfunction coronary therefore fail produce factor adequate quantity . This hypothesis verify extensive animal data investigator research , swine model coronary disease show severely inhibit action angiogenic growth factor . If one want angiogenesis work , mean improve function coronary lining patient severe ischemic heart disease must identify effect evaluate order allow angiogenic substance exert action towards successful revascularization heart muscle . An amino acid call L-arginine repeatedly show markedly improve function coronary artery lining patient ischemic heart disease administer regularly period several month . This research therefore test , form randomize clinical trial , whether concomitant approach make angiogenesis effective patient advance coronary disease , allow action growth factor take place heart . If approach successful , anticipated , angiogenesis constitute effective modality treatment coronary artery disease , patient advance , severe involvement unamenable form cardiac therapy coronary artery bypass grafting , even perhaps patient coronary artery disease need revascularization . The goal investigation towards make new , revolutionary , safe efficacious modality treatment number one killer disease Canadians complete agreement primary objective Heart Stroke Foundation Canada .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Modulation Angiogenic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EMAT trial test hypothesis concomitant treatment chronic endothelial dysfunction patient undergo angiogenic therapy make angiogenesis clinically effective . This achieve 2x2 factorial , double-blind , placebo-controlled randomize trial intramyocardial vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) angiogenesis dose 2 mg adjunct endothelial modulation therapy use oral L-arginine supplementation dose 6 g/day patient undergo surgical perivascular angiogenic therapy . The study involve surgical angiogenesis technique similar previously use report clinically safe principal investigator collaborator . Patients diffusely disease leave anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery artery graft internal thoracic artery either proximal distal portion ( accord felt surgeon optimal per usual practice ) . The segment LAD directly bypass ( i.e . either proximal portion distal bypass perform surgeon distal portion proximal bypass perform ) treat surgeon VEGF angiogenesis placebo injection . Other coronary artery need bypass grafting graft per usual practice , use arterial graft . Patients therefore randomize one four group time coronary artery bypass grafting : - growth factor ( VEGF ) angiogenesis along diffusely diseased , non-directly bypass LAD segment + L-arginine oral supplementation ; - placebo `` angiogenesis '' along diffusely diseased , non-directly bypass LAD segment + L-arginine oral supplementation ; - growth factor ( VEGF ) angiogenesis along diffusely diseased , non-directly bypass LAD segment + placebo oral supplementation ; - placebo `` angiogenesis '' along diffusely diseased , non-directly bypass LAD segment + placebo oral supplementation . The angiogenesis treatment consist either injection 2 mg ( divide 10 injection 200 μg ) plasmid DNA encode VEGF165 gene 10 x 1 ml injection sterile physiologic saline solution myocardial territory septum along diffusely diseased , non-directly bypass LAD segment . Other myocardial territory concomitantly revascularized arterial coronary bypass graft . The EMAT trial 's primary end-points relate objective myocardial perfusion index contractility intervene anterior myocardial portion , respectively measure cardiac positron-emission tomography ( PET ) use investigational radioisotope 13-N ammonia , RNA echocardiography . Using 13-N PET , collateral-dependent blood flow ischemic zone size measure double-blind fashion single observer baseline 3 month . To well delineate actual effect angiogenic therapy , baseline perfusion scan obtain 3 5 day operative procedure order account potentially confound effect CABG myocardial perfusion proximal distal anterior septal territory . The functional , secondary end-points EMAT trial consist clinical outcome include major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , freedom angina , angina class .</detailed_description>
