	<detailed_description>The diabetic foot ulcer etiology multiplex wound heal often successful due various reason . The ulcer 's etiology associate peripheral vascular disease , autonomic neuropathy endothelial . There may also present metabolic condition optimal wound-healing , delay process even ( hyperglycemia , hyperlipidemia , hyperinsulinemia , pro-coagulative state ) . It show statin may improve aspect make use adjuvant therapy treat diabetic foot ulcer interest theory . There far direct evidence , although documentation exist several possible associate condition . This study aim elucidate pleiotropic effect atorvastatin heal diabetic foot ulcer . Material Methods : This 26-week prospective randomise , open , study conduct pilot ass efficacy atorvastatin improve diabetic foot-ulcer healing . Atorvastatin give two dosage ( 10 mg 80 mg ) evaluation group do regard improvement foot ulcer healing , microcirculation inflammatory marker . We aim include 24 patient diabetes ( type 1 2 ) , age 30 , gender wind duration le 12 month . The patient recruit diabetic out-patient clinic two center ( Sarpsborg Hospital Asker Baerum Hospital ) .
