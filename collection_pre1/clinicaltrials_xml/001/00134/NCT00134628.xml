	<brief_summary>The principle objective research precisely determine degree benefit hyperbaric oxygen therapy affords treatment late radiation tissue injury . The study eight* component . Seven involve evaluation establish radionecrosis vary anatomic site ( mandible , larynx , skin , bladder , rectum , colon , gyn ) . The eighth investigate potential hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) therapy prophylax late radiation tissue injury . * ( One arm , HORTIS IV - Proctitis close patient recruitment . This decision base interim statistical analysis generate sufficient evidence support closing arm HORTIS . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Helpful Treating Radiation Tissue Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy key component control eradication malignant disease . Adequate tumoricidal dos may , however , result damage surround healthy tissue . Therapeutic radiation injury non-target tissue divide acute , sub-acute , delayed complication . Acute injury consider direct cellular toxicity , self-limiting , case successfully manage symptomatically . Sub-acute injury typically identifiable organ system , e.g. , radiation pneumonitis . These , , generally limit occasionally evolve late complication . Late change occur several month many year complete radiotherapy . The etiology radiation 's late effect normal tissue ( LENT ) vary somewhat organ system . Its hallmark , however , one culminate obliterative endarteritis , local hypoxia . The incidence LENT relate total radiation exposure length time patient complete radiotherapy . The high dose , long interval exposure , great risk . In many case , result radionecrotic lesion seriously impair form function , require extensive surgical correction repair . Such surgery fraught complication , hence inclusion `` prophylactic '' hyperbaric oxygen arm . A disturbing degree mortality complicate development LENT . Hyperbaric oxygen utilized treatment radiation tissue injury several decade . Most supportive basic science clinical evidence stem management mandibular osteoradionecrosis . More recently , use hyperbaric oxygen extend anatomic site . This expand use base , large part , presumed common underlie pathophysiology LENT , regardless anatomic location . Supportive clinical evidence site limit , however , need great degree scientific scrutiny .</detailed_description>
