	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Aztreonam Inhalation Solution ( AZLI ) Cystic Fibrosis Patients With P. Aeruginosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients CF often lung infection occur repeatedly worsen time . The lung infection often cause bacteria call PA . Treatment antibiotic stop slow growth bacteria . The antibiotic may give mouth , intravenously ( IV ) , inhalation mist . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy aztreonam inhalation solution ( AZLI ) , investigational formulation antibiotic administer use eFlowÂ® Electronic Nebulizer PARI GmbH , CF patient PA . In study , participant screen eligibility Visit 1 ( Day -42 ) return center Visit 2 14-day evaluation period . At Visit 2 ( Day -28 ) , participant begin 28-day course open-label Tobramycin Inhalation Solution ( TIS ) . At Visit 3 ( Day 0 ) , follow completion 28-day course TIS , participant begin randomize , blind treatment either AZLI twice day ( BID ) three time day ( TID ) placebo BID TID , continue treatment total 28 day , clinic visit Day 14 ( Visit 4 ) end treatment ( Visit 5 [ Day 28 ] ) . Participants return visit every 2 week 8 week end blind treatment ( Visits 6 9 [ Days 42 84 ] ) . Two hundred forty-seven participant treat TIS phase study . Two hundred eleven subject complete TIS phase treat placebo-controlled phase study drug ( AZLI placebo ) .</detailed_description>
