	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Trastuzumab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well trastuzumab work treat patient locally advance metastatic synovial sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate ( confirm complete response partial response ) patient HER2/neu-overexpressing locally advance metastatic synovial sarcoma treat trastuzumab ( Herceptin^® ) . Secondary - Determine frequency severity toxic effect drug patient . - Determine overall survival progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Correlate , preliminarily , SYT-SSX translocation , HER2/neu expression , monophasic biphasic phenotype clinical outcome patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin^® ) IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 week disease progression every 6 month 2 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 10-40 month .</detailed_description>
