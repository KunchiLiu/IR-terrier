	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Thalidomide may stop growth melanoma block blood flow tumor . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving thalidomide together temozolomide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give thalidomide together temozolomide work treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0508 : Thalidomide Temozolomide Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient unresectable stage IV malignant cutaneous melanoma treat thalidomide temozolomide . - Determine objective response ( confirm unconfirmed complete response partial response ) patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-56 temozolomide daily day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 9 , every 2 month disease progression , every 6 month 3 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55 patient accrue study within 14 month .</detailed_description>
