	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common , neurodegenerative condition . Although mostly late-onset disorder , 10 percent people PD report develop symptom age 50 . To date , six gene find associated PD , however majority find rare PD 'families ' . Some study also identify number environmental risk factor , pesticide use , appear increase risk PD . In previous study , Dr. Karen Marder research team find close family member people early- late-onset PD three-fold increase risk PD compare close family member people without PD . The purpose Consortium On Risk Early-onset Parkinson 's Disease ( CORE PD ) study identify genetic factor contribute development early-onset Parkinson 's disease , understand genetic factor interact gene environment cause PD . Participation study involve blood draw ( look genetic factor associate PD ) , questionnaires collect information family medical history , neurological examination . In addition participant may contact future ask participate detailed interview . At time , study investigator also ask participant permission contact family member invite participate study . This research study require participant sign consent form , state research voluntary confidential . In addition , since research study , genetic result release participant family member future . Scientists hope multi-center study increase current knowledge PD identification factor cause PD lead good diagnosis treatment .</detailed_description>
