	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose celecoxib treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) celecoxib necessary decrease peripheral blood lymphocyte CD4+ CD25+ T-lymphocyte regulatory cell patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine OBD drug necessary decrease peripheral blood lymphocyte FOXP3 level patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-7 absence unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3 patient receive escalate dos celecoxib optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) determine . The OBD define low dose result maximum decrease peripheral blood lymphocyte CD4+ CD25+ T-lymphocyte regulatory cell FOXP3 level dose-limiting toxicity occur . An additional 15 patient treated OBD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
