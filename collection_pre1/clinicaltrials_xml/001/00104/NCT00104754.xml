	<brief_title>Liposomal SN-38 Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient small cell lung cancer treat SN-38 liposome dose accord UGT1A1-specific genotype . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , overall progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . - Correlate UGT1A1-specific haplotype toxicity drug patient . - Correlate UGT1A1-specific haplotype outcomes patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord length time since prior treatment ( previously untreated disease OR chemosensitive disease ≥ 3 month since prior treatment v refractory disease OR chemoresistant disease &lt; 3 month since prior treatment ) . Patients receive SN-38 liposome IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete partial response patient stable disease ( SD ) previously treat study enrollment receive 4 additional course treatment . Patients CNS-only disease progression receive whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) . After completion WBRT , patient also receive 4 additional course treatment . Patients disease progression site CNS patient SD previously untreated study enrollment remove study . Quality life assess baseline , treatment course , annually 3 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 73 patient ( 40 stratum I 33 stratum II ) accrue study within 16-19 month .</detailed_description>
