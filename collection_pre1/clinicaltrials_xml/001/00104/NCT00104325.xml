	<brief_summary>Background : - National Institute Aging researcher look study require large number white blood cell lab use . Standard blood sample provide enough white blood cell study . Researchers want use cytapheresis collect white blood cell volunteer donor . This procedure collect large amount white blood cell reduce amount fluid cell lose . Objectives : - To use cytapheresis collect white blood cell study . Eligibility : - Healthy blood donor least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen accord usual blood donation procedure . - Participants provide white blood cell cytapheresis . The blood cell collect machine separate white blood cell rest blood . The rest blood return donor . - Participants may type donation every 56 day ( six time per year ) . They ask become repeat donor . A donation schedule may set . - Once year , participant blood test continue eligible donor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cytapheresis automate method/process cell removal collection involve continuous flow cell separation centrifugation withdrawal particular blood component . This allow blood component collect continuously return donor . Guidance recommendation performance procedure provide detail Standards American Association Blood Banks ( AABB ) Code Federal Regulations ( CFR ) . The study objective provide white blood cell obtain cytapheresis National Institute Aging ( NIA ) researcher in-vitro research study . The study population consist healthy male females 18 year old . Study subject anticipate non-patient community volunteer . Individuals exclude base gender , race ethnicity . The number subject enrolled 10 , 000 . This allow u try maintain 200 active participant protocol . Volunteers screen initially annually health history questionnaire laboratory test screen bleed immune disorder . Participants may undergo cytapheresis procedure every fifty-six day . We collect blood component cell distribution NIA research investigator study immune system . We perform cytapheresis collection 3 7 blood component pack per week . We need maintain active volunteer pool approximately 200 active volunteer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal healthy male female , age 18 year old Adequate venous access bilateral upper extremity accommodate least # 18 gauge dialysis needle . Willingness ability come NIA Apheresis Unit Harbor Hospital Baltimore blood collection procedure approximately every 56 day . Normal healthy male female , age 18 year old Adequate venous access bilateral upper extremity accommodate least # 18 gauge dialysis needle . Willingness ability come NIA Apheresis Unit Harbor Hospital Baltimore blood collection procedure approximately every 56 day . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unable verify identification volunteer state issue ID card , driver license , military ID . Participants earn great $ 600.00/year areissued 1099 form , therefore , positive identification require . Unable provide inform consent Weight le 110 pound mandate AABB guideline . Chronic Immunosuppressive medication Steroids , Cellcept Sirolimus . Steroids give minor illness ok take 6 week cytapherisis procedure Immunosuppressive medication may use time cytapheresis procedure decrease circulate white blood cell . Test result positive viral infection HIV , Hepatitis B C RPR . Researchers seek healthy , pristine cell . Due ongoing nature chronic viral bacterial infection , white cell population peripheral blood change . Researchers want study change white cell population factor age alter infection . Ongoing risk factor HIV Hepatitis B C : intravenous drug use , nonmonogamous unprotected intercourse , chronic use clot factor concentrate prothrombin complex , Factor XIII Factor VIIa . These virus weaken immune system cause change white blood cell . Risk factor CreutzfeldtJakob disease : relative disease , receive beef insulin growth hormone human pituitary gland , residency/travel high risk country ( complete list country locate Cytapheresis Screening manual keep NIA apheresis unit ) . This transmittable infectious disease long incubation period . Major medical illness type liquid solid tumor cancer , diabetes , history deep vein thrombosis , organ bone marrow transplant , liver , kidney , heart lung disease . A medical finding show participant could safely go procedure . ( Parkinson disease , dementia uncontrolled behavior would place participant safety risk ) Major infectious disease Chagas disease , babesiosis , syphilis malaria Bleeding condition hemophilia von Willebrand disease . Significant abnormality find result blood test elevate liver enzymes , abnormal kidney function , positive viral titer , fast blood glucose great 120 . On medication alter white blood cell function chronic steroid use , histamine2 blocker , antiviral chemotherapy . ( complete list locate Cytapheresis Screening manual store NIA Apheresis unit ) .</criteria>
