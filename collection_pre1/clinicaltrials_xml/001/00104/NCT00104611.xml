	<brief_summary>This trial test safety efficacy rTMS device treatment major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . It hypothesize rTMS antidepressant effect . It 10-week , randomize , sham-controlled , multicenter trial outpatient recruit academic private research center . It comprise three major phase : pre-study screening , acute treatment , post-treatment taper . Eligible patient randomize one two rTMS treatment group . One group receive active rTMS treatment one receive inactive , sham , treatment . Each treatment take 45 minute do outpatient basis . All trial relate medical care provide cost participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial test safety efficacy rTMS device treatment major depressive disorder . Major depression one prevalent profoundly debilitate disease worldwide . In recent report , estimate year 2020 , depression second heart disease magnitude disease burden determine disability-adjusted life year . Despite major advance treatment depression last three decade , improvement need . For instance , respect antidepressant pharmacotherapy , 1/3 patient estimate nearly full resolution clinical symptom first medication trial . Indeed , partial remission lack response treatment experienced majority patient . Even serial trial antidepressant medication , least 10 15 % patient major depression estimate experience limited benefit remain chronically depressed significant psychosocial morbidity . Some patient tolerate dosage duration antidepressant treatment require treatment trial consider adequate . In patient , intolerance somatic treatment major depression lead chronicity impaired function , likely hinders long-term compliance treatment . For many patient treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) , complex regimen polypharmacotherapy , use electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) currently available treatment option . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) promise alternative treatment ECT pharmacotherapy patient present MDD . An rTMS procedure non-invasive , require anesthesia , may deliver appropriately staffed outpatient setting . By create time-varying magnetic field unimpeded scalp skull , TMS focally painlessly stimulate cortex awake individual . Through principle magnetic induction , localize pulsed magnetic field generate coil surface head induces electrical current depolarizes underlie superficial neuron . It widely think rTMS produce behavioral effect solely induction current flow cortex . Several factor drive investigation rTMS treatment MDD . Early report change mood normal participant , non-invasive nature rTMS , favorable side effect profile compare ECT , non-response number MDD patient pharmacotherapy and/or ECT , likely play role . Since initial study , continue high interest rTMS antidepressant treatment . Multiple trial conduct researcher diverse environment around world . However , , rigorously conduct large , multicenter rTMS clinical trial treatment patient MDD . Because publish research largely conduct single center , sample size antidepressant trial small . However , majority 20 report find modest large antidepressant effect increase trial period . By design , trial provide robust information regard antidepressant effect rTMS adult population MDD patient .</detailed_description>
