	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cetuximab give together cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient stage IB , stage II , stage III , stage IVA cervical cancer . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Internal radiation therapy use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Giving cetuximab together cisplatin radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose safe biologically effective dose cetuximab administer combination cisplatin , external beam radiotherapy , brachytherapy patient stage IB-IVA cervical cancer . II . Determine feasibility regimen , term chronic acute toxic effect , patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine distribution progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen 1 year study entry . II . Determine site recurrence ( locoregional v distant ) patient treat regimen 1 year study entry . III . Correlate response progression-free survival epidermal growth factor receptor expression tumor sample patient treat regimen 1 year study entry . IV . Correlate response progression-free survival grade cetuximab-induced rash patient treat regimen 1 year study entry . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study cetuximab . Patients stratify accord nodal status ( positive para-aortic and/or pelvic lymph node vs negative para-aortic pelvic lymph node ) . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour cisplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ( week 1-6 ) . Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy para-aortic pelvic lymph node OR whole pelvis daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 ( week 1-5 ) . Patients receive either 1 2 application low-dose rate brachytherapy week 6-8 OR 5 application high-dose rate ( HDR ) * brachytherapy weekly week 4-8 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *No external beam radiotherapy administer day HDR brachytherapy . If majority external beam radiotherapy administer , HDR brachytherapy may administer 2 application per week ( separate least 72 hour ) order complete treatment within 8 week . Cohorts 3-6 patient per stratum receive escalate dos cetuximab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
