Investigators may use historical EEG long appropriate documentation . Has document history PGTC seizures without generalized seizure type ( ) focal onset , least 1 PGTC seizure eight consecutive week ( i.e. , 56 consecutive day ) prior start 8week Baseline Phase . Has least 3 PGTC seizure occur anytime 8week ( i.e. , 56 day ) prospective Baseline Phase . NOTE : When historical baseline use , time period count documentation inclusion criterion 4 5 . Additionally , innumerable seizure activity count towards number seizure require randomization . NOTE : With authorization GSK , maximum four week ( i.e. , 28 day ) historical seizure data may replace four week ( i.e. , 28 day ) prospective Baseline Phase subject provide reliable documentation follow : 1. complete daily seizure diary include number seizure experience day along exact classification seizure type consecutive day prior prospective Baseline Phase 2. stability prescribe dosage background antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) 3. compliance background AEDs . All subject permit use historical seizure data must complete minimum four week ( i.e. , 28 day ) prospective Baseline Phase . The historical Baseline Phase prospective Baseline Phase must equal 56 consecutive day . Is currently treat stable regimen one two AED ( ) least four week prior start Baseline Phase ( historical prospective ) . NOTE : Benzodiazepines use chronically consider concurrent AEDs . NOTE : Subjects surgically implanted vagal nerve stimulators ( VNS ) allow enter study provide follow condition meet : 1 . VNS place least 24 week prior Baseline Phase . 2 . The setting must remain least 28 day prior Baseline Phase . 3 . The setting must remain Baseline , Escalation , Maintenance Transition Phases . 4 . The battery expect last duration study . 5 . VNS count `` concurrent AED . '' Is able willing maintain accurate complete daily write seizure diary , parent/caregiver able willing maintain accurate complete daily write seizure diary entire duration study . Is able comply dose study drug , background AEDs study procedure .
