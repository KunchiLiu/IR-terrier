	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gefitinib surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well gefitinib work treat patient undergo surgery stage I , stage II , stage III non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect neoadjuvant gefitinib downstream signal pathway , include Src-Stat3 , PI3K/Akt , ERK activity , Bcl-2 family member patient resectable stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine effect drug cell cycle apoptosis within primary tumor , measure change pre- post-treatment Ki-67 , Mcm2 , cleave caspase-3 , ApoTag , patient . Secondary - Determine clinical response rate patient treat drug . - Determine pathological response rate , define &gt; 95 % necrosis fibrosis pathological specimen , patient treat drug . - Determine metabolic activity drug patient . - Determine safety , tolerability , feasibility drug , term toxicity post-treatment resectability , patient . - Correlate plasma tumor concentration drug change post-treatment molecular marker patient . - Identify gene profile predict response drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 day completion gefitinib , patient undergo restaging evaluation . Patients whose disease still consider resectable proceed surgery . Patients undergo thoracotomy lobectomy pneumonectomy OR sleeve resection . Patients also undergo mediastinal lymph node dissection . After surgical resection , treatment gefitinib may continue study discretion principal investigator . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study within 12.5 month .</detailed_description>
