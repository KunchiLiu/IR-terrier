	<brief_summary>Zinc deficiency occasionally report CF , need additional zinc unclear . We examine effect additional zinc supplement zinc absorption , zinc excretion , zinc balance zinc kinetics child CF . Twelve child CF receive additional zinc , twelve . We also compare child CF 12 healthy child without CF . We hypothesize child CF poor zinc absorption high zinc excretion , lead poor zinc balance abnormal zinc kinetics . We hypothesize child CF give zinc supplement higher zinc balance normal zinc kinetics without supplementation , zinc balance zinc kinetics similar healthy child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Homeostasis Kinetics Children With Cystic Fibrosis ( CF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overt zinc deficiency present feature acrodermatitis enteropathica ( AE ) include diarrhea , dermatitis , growth failure , poor immune function . AE describe complication cystic fibrosis , initial presenting feature . As AE almost never describe otherwise healthy subject consume self-selected diet , suggest profound disturbance zinc metabolism , either absorption excretion , occur CF . Few study measure zinc absorption child CF . Those demonstrated significant reduction zinc absorption CF subject pancreatic insufficiency significant increase zinc absorption pancreatic enzyme replacement . However , zinc metabolism maintain change fractional zinc absorption zinc loss gastro-intestinal tract ( endogenous fecal zinc excretion ) . Of two mechanism , change endogenous fecal zinc excretion appear important . To date , one study measure endogenous fecal zinc excretion subject CF . Krebs et al . study 15 infant , less 4 month age , newly diagnose CF . They find infant negative zinc balance , endogenous fecal zinc excretion significantly correlate degree fat malabsorption . These result difficult interpret control group study , little publish data zinc absorption healthy infant age , data endogenous fecal zinc excretion . Clearly , good measure zinc status require fully understand importance zinc deficiency CF , relationship fat malabsorption zinc balance . In past , use novel stable isotope-based multicompartmental model study zinc status healthy disease state . These prove able detect change zinc metabolism two experimental paradigm zinc deficiency , even plasma zinc become abnormal . We hypothesize , 1 . Children CF bad zinc status , low fractional zinc absorption , increase endogenous fecal zinc excretion , poor zinc balance , age-matched control . 2 . In child CF , endogenous fecal zinc excretion significantly positively correlate , zinc absorption zinc balance significantly negatively correlated fecal fat excretion . 3 . After two month zinc supplementation 20 mg/d zinc zinc acetate , child CF similar zinc status , fractional zinc absorption , endogenous fecal zinc excretion , zinc balance age-matched control . 4 . Two month zinc supplementation affect iron status ( Hemoglobin , serum ferritin , serum transferrin receptor ) copper status ( serum copper , ceruloplasmin , copper/ zinc superoxide dismutase ) . Twenty-four child CF age 8-14 year old recruit Cystic Fibrosis Clinic Texas Children 's Hospital . Children consider eligible diagnosis CF , weigh 25 kg , clinical diagnosis pancreatic insufficiency require pancreatic enzyme replacement , history good compliance medical therapy . Subjects consider ineligible gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract surgery , pancreatic endocrine dysfunction , take 10 mg/d zinc supplement . The study explain subject parent . Informed write consent obtain parent , write consent assent ( age appropriate ) subject . After consent obtain , register dietician use food frequency questionnaire ass child 's usual zinc intake . Advice give eat healthy balance diet meet recommend daily allowance ( RDA ) zinc essential mineral . Except dietary advice , dietary intervention carry . Twelve healthy child age 8-14 year old recruit public advertisement , local contact word mouth . They eligible study similar age , gender ethnicity CF subject . Informed consent assent obtain manner CF child , dietary advice guidance give . The child CF randomize receive zinc supplement 20 mg/d zinc acetate identical appear placebo . Randomization stratify gender ethnicity . Randomization table maintain Investigation Pharmacy Service Texas Children 's Hospital . Once consent obtain Investigation Pharmacy Service contact randomize child receive one two identical appear solution - one contain 10 mg/mL elemental zinc zinc acetate one placebo . The subject , parent investigator blind solution child randomize receive . Children admit General Clinical Research Center overnight fast . A local anesthetic cream apply vein antecubital fossa . Blood , 10-15 mL , draw baseline laboratory investigation include complete blood count , liver function test , plasma zinc , serum ferritin , serum transferrin receptor concentration , serum copper , serum ceruloplasmin erythrocyte cU/Zn- superoxide dismutase . After blood take , subject provide first bottle zinc solution , placebo . They instruct take 1 mL solution twice daily two month . New supply zinc placebo solution provide require study . All use partially used bottle return Investigation Pharmacy Service amount take calculated change weight bottle . After consume placebo zinc solution two month , child CF admit General Clinical Research Center follow overnight fast . Subjects ask empty bladder . An intravenous heparin-lock catheter insert vein antecubital fossa dorsum hand baseline blood sample take serum chemistry . Subjects give breakfast contain approximately 3 mg zinc , include 120 mL orange juice 2 mg zinc-67 add 18-24 hour earlier . Immediately breakfast , 0.5 mg zinc-70 infused venipuncture arm 30-60 second , butterfly infusion set flush 5 mL normal saline . Blood sample draw heparin lock catheter 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 60 , 120 180 minute intravenous zinc isotope give . Further blood sample draw venipuncture 24 , 72 , 120 hour intravenous isotope give . These blood sample anticoagulated certified zinc-free ammonium heparin tube ( Monvette 9ml AH , Sarstedt Inc. , Newton , NC ) . Plasma separate centrifugation store -80°C pending analysis . A complete urine fecal collection make metabolic study . Urine sample collect 8-h aliquot stool pass collect individually . Urine fecal sample store -20°C pending analysis . Control child study exactly manner , approximately 2 month baseline blood draw . The primary hypothesis child CF low fractional zinc absorption , increase endogenous fecal zinc excretion , poor zinc balance bad zinc status , age-matched control . This assess use ANOVA . If suggest significant `` group '' effect , post-hoc test carried use Tukey-Kramer test . The kinetic parameter use assess zinc status k ( 2,1 ) show large change response zinc deficiency , previous study . This analysis test hypotheses 1 3 ( see ) . Should significant difference exist age , weight , etc . group , statistically correct use ANCOVA . Data analyze entire study population , CF child pancreatic insufficiency alone . The study design 80 % power detecting change k ( 2,1 ) two group pancreatic insufficient CF child alone . The relationship fecal fat endogenous fecal zinc excretion , zinc balance ( hypothesis 2 ) , assess use simple multiple regression analysis . The effect zinc supplementation iron copper status examine use 2 sample t-test , compare CF child zinc supplementation , receive zinc supplementation .</detailed_description>
