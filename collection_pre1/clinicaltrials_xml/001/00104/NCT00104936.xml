	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Radiosurgery may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving radiation therapy radiosurgery surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy radiosurgery effective observation alone treat benign meningioma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy radiosurgery see well work compare observation alone treat patient newly diagnose , benign meningioma partially remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Radiosurgery Compared With Observation Alone Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed , Benign Meningioma That Has Been Partially Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival patient newly diagnose , incompletely resect , benign intracranial grade I meningioma treat adjuvant conventional fractionate radiotherapy radiosurgery v observation . Secondary - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence second surgery patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence acute long-term neurotoxicity patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord post-surgery MRI staging ( 3 vs 4 v 5 ) , skull base location ( yes v ) , age ( &lt; 60 v â‰¥ 60 ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo observation . - Arm II : Within 4-7 month surgery , patient undergo conventional fractionated radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 6 week OR single treatment high-dose radiosurgery absence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , 6 month randomization , annually thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month randomization annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 478 patient ( 239 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3-4 year .</detailed_description>
