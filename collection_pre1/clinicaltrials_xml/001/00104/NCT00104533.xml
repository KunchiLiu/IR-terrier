	<brief_title>Effectiveness Magnetic Therapy Pain Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Static magnetic therapy increasingly used alleviate pain ; however , efficacy determine yet . The aim proposal evaluate effect magnetic therapy pain intensity level , opioid requirement , opioid side effect . A randomized , double blind , control trial propose . Patients 8 year old old subject variety surgical procedure pain intensity least 5/10 randomized two group : Magnetic therapy Placebo . The device place around surgical wound 2 hour . Every ten minute , patient rate pain intensity 0-10 numerical rating scale , morphine administer pain intensity ≤ 4/10 . Pain intensity primary outcome . Opioid requirement opioid side effect secondary outcome . To detect difference 1 unit ( 0 10 ) group 80 % power , assume baseline pain intensity 7.9 ± 2.0 , estimate need 70 patient per group . We use intention-to-treat analysis . To analyze effect treatment pain intensity , analysis repeat measure use generalized estimating equation use . The proportion subject group exhibit 50 % pain relief one hour application magnetic device number need treat also calculate . To analyze effect treatment opioid requirement , difference morphine requirement group two hour placement magnet estimate . To analyze effect treatment opioid side effect , variable summarizes presence side effect two hour placement magnet create , absolute risk difference develop side effect estimate . Ninety five percent confidence interval report . This proposal would contribute substantially complementary medicine field , scientific rigor , also pain model evaluate strengthens validity result .</detailed_description>
