	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide treat young patient relapsed refractory solid tumor myelodysplastic syndrome . Lenalidomide may stop growth solid tumor myelodysplastic syndrome block blood flow cancer . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose lenalidomide pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor . II . Determine toxic effect drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine , preliminarily , feasibility administer drug pediatric patient relapse refractory myelodysplastic syndrome . II . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity drug patient population . III . Determine immunologic change patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( solid tumor v myelodysplastic syndrome [ MDS ] ) . Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient solid tumor receive escalate dos lenalidomide maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients MDS receive fix dose ( undergo dose escalation ) lenalidomide . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
