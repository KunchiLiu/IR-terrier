	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may make body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vaccine therapy work treat patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient HLA-A2-positive , stage IIIB IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat vaccine therapy comprise EP-2101 emulsified montanide ISA-51 historical control patient HLA-A2-negative , stage IIIB IV recurrent NSCLC undergo observation . - Determine safety vaccine patient . Secondary - Determine progression-free survival patient treat vaccine . - Determine frequency , magnitude , breadth cytotoxic helper T-cell response vaccine epitopes patient treated vaccine . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord HLA-A2 status . - Group I ( HLA-A2 positive ) : Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise EP-2101 emulsified montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 . - Group II ( HLA-A2 negative ) : Patients undergo observation week 9 18 . After completion study treatment , patient group I follow 3 week . All patient follow month 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , every 3 month 2 year , annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 84 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
