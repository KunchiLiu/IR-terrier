	<brief_title>FR901228 Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient unresectable stage III stage IV malignant melanoma treat FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) . Secondary - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-40 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
