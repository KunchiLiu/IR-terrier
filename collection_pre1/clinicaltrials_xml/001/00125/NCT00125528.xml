	<brief_summary>Pre-clinical study rat suggest D-cycloserine ( DCS ) effective management chronic neuropathic pain . This pilot study attempt determine effect D-cycloserine treatment chronic low back pain . Other aim study determine safety D-cycloserine treatment chronic low back pain determine pain measurement scale best measure efficacy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D-cycloserine Management Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human brain imaging study indicate medial prefrontal cortex activity predict 80 % variance chronic back pain intensity . Therefore , investigator hypothesize modulation brain activity site result analgesia . D-cycloserine show potentiate condition fear extinction . Based investigator hypothesize chronic neuropathic pain ( back pain radiculopathy ) partially mediate potentiate decreased ability extinguish pain memory , investigator hypothesize mediate reward/aversion brain circuitry , specifically medial prefrontal cortex . They test idea pre-clinical study demonstrate rat neuropathic pain show analgesia long-term treated D-cycloserine . In human chronic back pain , investigator hypothesize D-cycloserine enhance extinction back pain turn result reduce emotional relevance pain , reduce suffering . It quite possible overall intensity back pain unaffected , however , associate suffer significantly attenuate . This double-blind , randomize , parallel group escalate dose study compare D-cycloserine twice day ( bid ) placebo bid patient chronic low back pain . Subjects meet inclusion criterion continue baseline medication treat 12 week study drug : 50 mg bid DCS match placebo first 4 week , 100mg bid DCS match placebo 4 week finally 200mg bid DCS match placebo 4 week . Assessments efficacy safety undertaken every 2 week use standard , validated instrument evaluate change pain , function , quality life adverse event .</detailed_description>
