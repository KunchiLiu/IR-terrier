	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) currently among top three lead cause central vision loss veteran ( Chomsky et al. , 1995 ) prevalent cause blindness among veteran ( 37.2 % , Quillen &amp; Henry , 2000 ) . The loss central vision associate disease profound impact quality life affect , many suffer depression . It devastate longer able read newspaper recognize facial expression . The use prefer retinal location ( PRLs ) compensate diseased fovea offer hope patient regain function . The investigator develop protocol include train three major visual skill area : - visual awareness eccentric viewing ; - reading eye movement ; - processing sequentially present lexical information . Module 1 focus make patient aware good vision eccentric location relative degrade vision diseased fovea . Module 2 focus improvement control eye movement PRL . Module 3 focus reading practice without eye movement . These program curriculum preliminary result provide present proposal . The primary aim proposal quantitatively assess relative effectiveness improve read establish minimum training time need skill improvement . Sixty patient AMD already use PRL select similar visual characteristic ( e.g. , visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , size scotoma , duration disease ) include experimental group . All patient experimental group train three module use repeated measure - completely counterbalance - design control train order effect . An additional 24 AMD patient recruit control group test time interval experimental patient , receive train assessment period interval . The control group patient give option receive training follow assessment period . Both experimental control patient assess use outcome measure read ( use MNRead Acuity Charts , Pepper Visual Skills Reading ( VSR ) Test , View Sentences Test ) . The performance experimental patient outcomes battery post-training compare pre-training performance battery . Any change performance experimental patient compare test-retest performance control patient . A questionnaire ( Veterans Administration Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire ) also administer assess perceive ability perform everyday task follow training . The control patient also receive questionnaire assessment period . In addition , experimental patient also assess exercise practice module end daily training session determine exactly train protocol improvement performance exercise train occur . These daily performance measure provide fine scale detecting performance change . Statistical analysis conduct answer follow key question : - What visual skill related read trainable ? - Which method best training skill ? - What time course visual skill improvement ? - Do answer question depend upon individual patient characteristic ( e.g. , age , disease severity , PRL location , cognitive factor ) ? - Do patient undergo training , repeat read performance assessment , show improvement read skill ? Advances make area retinal cell transplantation , gene therapy , retinal prosthetics . When technique become part standard clinical care , likely patient require vision rehabilitation technique help make sense potentially fragmented percept . This research offer evaluation relative successes component read rehabilitation lead design efficient effective composite training strategy .</detailed_description>
