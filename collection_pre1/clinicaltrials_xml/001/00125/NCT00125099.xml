	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response DNA HIV Vaccine ( VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP ) HIV Infected Individuals With Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) greatly improve mortality morbidity rate associate HIV AIDS . However , many HIV-1 infected individual unable access HAART . It therefore important develop safe effective therapeutic vaccine improve immune control viral replication reduce need antiretroviral medication . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity HIV-1 DNA vaccine VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP treat HIV-1 infected individual initiate antiretroviral therapy acute infection . This study involve supervise treatment interruption ( STI ) order determine whether therapeutic vaccination result improve immune control viral replication . Participants study randomly assign receive either therapeutic vaccine placebo addition regular HAART regimen . During first part study , participant receive 4 vaccination Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 24 . All individual complete therapeutic vaccination phase ( defined complete least 3 immunization , include Week 24 immunization ) give opportunity participate second part study undergo supervise discontinuation HAART . At Week 30 , participant discontinue antiretroviral treatment closely monitor . Participants restart HAART experience significant decline CD4 count , increase viral load , physician recommend resume HAART . At Week 52 , participant restart HAART discretion primary physician . 21 study visit occur period 52 week . After Week 52 , monthly study visit occur Week 72 . Study visit last approximately two hour include physical exam blood urine collection .</detailed_description>
