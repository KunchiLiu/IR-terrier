	<brief_title>Mechanisms Upper-Extremity Motor Recovery Post-stroke Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal extend work accomplish initial study ( project # B2405R , 'Effects Strength Training Upper-limb Function Post-stroke Hemiparesis ' ) . In present study conduct double-blind , randomize clinical trial stag rehabilitation upper-extremity involve sequential delivery functional therapy high intensity resistance training . Therefore , proposal directly compare effect functional resistance training deliver individually . The researcher ' previous work investigate hybrid therapy functional resistance train functional training alone . All subject participate 5 week run-in period treatment . This no-treatment block afford multiple baseline measurement , addition , provide information regard rate magnitude spontaneous recovery without treatment . Following second baseline measurement , subject randomize receive either 10 week functional training follow 10 week high-intensity resistance training resistance training follow functional training . Re-evaluation occur follow block treatment , retention effect evaluate 6 12 month additional treatment . Subjects evaluate : outcome measure use broadly Clinical Neurology Rehabilitation , battery biomechanical performance measure include strength , muscle activation , reflex modulation motor coordination , kinematics free reach movement . The researcher investigate person intermediate phase recovery define 6 18 month post-cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , complete inpatient outpatient therapy , continue experience residual motor deficit .</detailed_description>
