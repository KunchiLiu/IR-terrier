	<detailed_description>Background : Malignant glioma common primary brain tumor adult . Despite aggressive therapy , le 40 % patient expect live beyond 5 year . External beam radiotherapy follow maximal surgical resection mainstay treatment group patient . Recent intensification local therapy focus radiotherapy planning result successful escalation dose . Further improvement therapeutic index therapy desirable . Radiologic characterization glial tumor rely predominantly CT MRI image ; study provide good anatomic information regard size location tumor , well surround structure , unable evaluate viability proliferative activity tumor . Thus , enhance lesion CT MRI may correspond precisely area viable tumor , especially surgery radiotherapy . Also , contrast enhance MRI relies region blood brain barrier ( BBB ) breakdown , tumor specific , thus non-neoplastic process may lead finding similar disease progression . This phenomenon make conventional radiologic follow-up difficult patient receive radiotherapy , image technique limit ability discern radiotherapy effect necrosis recurrence progression . Finally , discriminate viable tumor , CT MRI limit usefulness assess response therapy , unable effectively predict outcome . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) relatively new technology may able address issue . The objective current study investigate change occur tumor relate magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectra course radical radiotherapy malignant glioma . The primary endpoint study identify characteristic evolve metabolite pattern MRSI , , , radiotherapy correlate overall survival , progression-free survival high grade glioma . Secondary endpoint involve correlation MRSI metabolite pattern time progression Karnofsky performance status . Eligibility Criteria : - Patients must older 18 year age . - Patients must histologically prove malignant glioma brain . - Patients must bi-directionally measurable enhance residual disease T1 weight image . - Patients must willing undergo high dose radiotherapy brain treatment glial tumor . - Patients must willing able comply study requirement . - The patient legally authorize representative must fully understand element informed consent , sign consent document . Ineligibility Criteria : Ineligibility criterion include : - History previous RT head neck region - History lupus , scleroderma RT hypersensitivity - Co-existing medical condition preclude radiotherapy - Psychiatric condition preclude informed consent . - Medical psychiatric condition preclude MR study ( eg . pacemaker , aneurysm clip , neuro stimulator , cochlear implant , severe claustrophobia/anxiety ) Patients approach study participation time initial radiation oncology consultation outpatient department Cross Cancer Institute ( CCI ) . Patients wish participate , satisfy eligibility exclusion criterion , require review sign consent form time . Patients undergo regular staging investigation , construction immobilizing shell , treatment planning MRI , CT simulation . These study typically complete 2 week initial consult . Radiotherapy commence approximately 3-4 week initial consult . At week 0 RT , prior begin therapy , patient undergo baseline MRS . The mid-RT MRS study perform week 4 RT . The post therapy scan take place 2 month post-therapy . From , patient see clinic every 2-4 month follow-up , undergo MRI MRS scan visit 1 year . Data Collection Statistical Analysis : The height MRS metabolite peak measure voxels within enhance MRI lesion voxels normal brain patient . Relative metabolite value ( normalized value normal brain ) generate , well relative metabolite ratio ( eg . relative choline/relative NAA ) time point ( week 0 , week 4 , post-RT , follow-up ) . For patient , relative metabolite level ( ratio ) plot time . Patients partition group , base similar evolve MRS pattern . For group , curve survival disease free progression generate Kaplan-Meier method . The curve analyze statistical significance log-rank method . The investigator plan accrue 30 patient present study . They confident 30 patient sufficient generate statistically significant result . In study effect brain tumor radiotherapy normal brain image NMR spectroscopy , Urtasun et al able find statistically significant metabolite change proton MRS image 10 patient . In addition , data utilize retrospective aspect study contain information approximately 30 patient MRS scan . The trend find data use guide data analysis prospective study . Finally , give relative distribution frequency histology see new patient CNS clinic CCI , investigator feel target accrual 30 patient feasible within time restraint project .</detailed_description>
