	<detailed_description>The objective double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled Phase II study determine whether recombinant subunit vaccine comprise cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) envelope glycoprotein B ( gB ) MF59 adjuvant prevent maternal CMV infection pregnancy high risk population woman childbearing age . This study also permit determination whether approach use feasible one large scale efficacy trial prevention congenital CMV endpoint . CMV gB vaccine comprise recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein produce Chinese hamster ovary cell line . The CMV gB combine novel adjuvant , MF59 , proprietary oil-in-water emulsion . Vaccines administer 0 , 1 , 6 month intramuscular injection leave deltoid . Placebo recipient give normal saline solution . Study participant recruit postpartum ward community . Potential participant screen antibody CMV ; seronegative invited participate vaccine study . Participants receive initial immunization 1.5 12 month postpartum . A total 464 , seronegative woman willing participate meet enrollment inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1 2 group : Group I participants receive 20 microgram gB MF59 ; Group II participant receive placebo ( normal saline ) . During immunization period local systemic reactogenicity assess 7-day diary card complete dose vaccine . Adverse event tabulate . Safety assess compare local systemic reactogenicity adverse event rate vaccine placebo recipient . Study participant screen CMV infection every three month , begin three month first dose vaccine , use CMV IgG antibody assay preabsorption serum purify recombinant CMV gB ( vaccine antigen ) . CMV infection confirm either isolation virus detection CMV DNA body fluid . After 3 dose vaccine schedule complete , participant follow every 3 month . The primary endpoint time CMV infection . The rate congenital CMV infection offspring immunized mother secondary endpoint . The rate congenital CMV infection compare offspring vaccine placebo recipient . Each subject follow 3 year third dose vaccine . Specific information collect follow pregnancy outcome : pregnancy report , pregnancy follow-up , abnormal pregnancy outcome-mother , abnormal pregnancy outcome-infant .</detailed_description>
