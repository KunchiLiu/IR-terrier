	<brief_summary>This study examine effect S-adenosyl methionine ( SAMe ) itch fatigue patient primary biliary cirrhosis , disease small bile duct liver . Ursodiol , currently available treatment biliary cirrhosis , cure disease , many people continue symptom liver test abnormality despite treatment . SAMe naturally occur substance find cell body . The high level substance produce liver , help rid body toxin breakdown product metabolism . Studies Europe suggest SAMe may help : 1 ) decrease fatigue itch common person liver problem , 2 ) decrease level liver enzymes blood , suggest may decrease amount liver injury . Patients 21 year age old primary biliary cirrhosis take ursodiol symptom itch fatigue may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , review medical record , routine blood test , symptom rating scale . Participants stop medication itch 4 week start study , continue take ursodiol 42-week trial . On enter study , patient assign take either SAMe placebo tablet twice day 12 week . While take medication , follow clinic every 2 week first month every 4 week fill symptom questionnaire short medical evaluation blood test . At end 12 week , treatment interrupt 2-week `` wash-out '' period , patient begin 12-week crossover treatment ; , patient take SAMe switch placebo , take placebo switch SAMe . After complete second 12-week treatment course , patient come clinic 4 , 8 , 12 week fill symptom questionnaires medical evaluation blood test . At last visit , patient tell type tablet receive two course treatment . SAMe available without prescription many form over-the-counter medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SAMe Treat Biliary Cirrhosis Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess efficacy S-adenosyl methionine ( SAMe ) symptomatic relief primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) , treat 50 patient either SAM-e ( 800 mg BID ) placebo 12 week cross-over , double-blind placebo-controlled study . S-adenosyl methionine nutritional supplement available over-the-counter formula use treatment depression arthritic pain . SAMe produce virtually cell participate many biochemical pathway major methyl contributor . Intracellular level SAMe often decrease advanced liver disease . At present SAMe undergo extensive evaluation large multicenter , randomize control trial adjunctive therapy alcoholic liver disease . SAMe also evaluate patient intrahepatic cholestasis cholestasis pregnancy promise effect relieve pruritus fatigue improve serum liver associate enzyme . In study , recruit patient PBC pruritus fatigue despite therapy ursodiol ( currently recommend therapy PBC partially effective relieve pruritus fatigue ) . After medical evaluation brief period monitoring , patient randomize receive either SAMe placebo give oral form similar appear capsule twice daily . Patients follow regular interval symptom monitor validated questionnaire well side effect serum biochemical hematological test . After 12 week , therapy withdraw 2 week patient switch alternative capsule , either SAMe placebo , another 12 week . The primary endpoint therapy improvement symptom pruritus fatigue . Secondary endpoint improvement serum biochemical liver relate enzyme .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age entry least 21 year old . Pathologically diagnosed primary biliary cirrhosis ( make liver biopsy perform within 10 year enrollment ) receipt stable dos ursodiol least 6 month enrollment . The dose urosodiol adjust achieve stable serum liver enzymes level . Symptoms itch fatigue . The presence symptom verify medical history , symptom questionnaire visual analogue scale ( result great 20 mm ) least two screen visit . Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence another form liver disease . Hepatitis B define presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) serum . Hepatitis C define presence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA serum . Primary sclerosing cholangitis define liver histology . Wilson disease define ceruloplasmin limit normal liver histology consistent Wilson disease . Autoimmune hepatitis define antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) 3 EU great ( ELISA ) liver histology consistent autoimmune hepatitis previous response immunosuppressive therapy autoimmune hepatitis . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency define alpha1antitrypsin level less normal liver histology consistent alpha1antitrypsin deficiency . Hemochromatosis define presence 3+ 4+ stainable iron liver biopsy homozygosity C282Y compound heterozygosity C282Y/H63D . Patients iron saturation index great 45 % serum ferritin level great 300 ng/ml men great equal 250 ng/ml woman undergo genetic test C282Y H63D . Drug induce liver disease define basis typical exposure history . Bile duct obstruction suggest image study do within previous six month . Decompensated liver disease define ChildPugh score 7 great . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , pulmonary disease hypoxia , renal failure , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease include depression , malignancy condition opinion investigator would preclude treatment . Patients suffer severe depression define score great equal 25 CESD screen test eligible enrollment . Known HIV infection . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous one year . Pregnancy , lactation inability practice adequate contraception woman child bear age . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma show liver mass image study alphafetoprotein level great 200 ng/ml . Any condition , opinion investigator would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study . History hypersensitivity reaction Sadenosyl methionine . Serum creatinine great 1.5mg/dl men great 1.4 mg/dl woman .</criteria>
