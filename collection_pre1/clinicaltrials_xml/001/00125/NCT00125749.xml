	<brief_title>Vaccination Patients With Stage IV Melanoma With Dendritic Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel dendritic cell vaccine develop Baylor Institute Immunology Research ( BIIR ) . Pre-clinical study find dendritic cell vaccine efficient induce tumor specific immunity dendritic cell vaccine . Further study BIIR do dendritic cell load kill melanoma cell melanoma cell line treat heat loading . Both study show DCs manufacture novel way efficient prim melanoma specific CD8+ cell . Thus , strategy clinical trial test recent laboratory finding clinical setting . An additional objective study determine effectiveness frozen vaccine product differs previous vaccine manufacture `` fresh '' . This clinical trial evaluate novel dendritic cell vaccine patient Stage IV melanoma . The trial accrue total 30 subject . The primary goal trial test safety/tolerability/feasibility vaccine preparation rate objective clinical response . A 15 % objective response rate accept patient fail previous therapy IL-2 and/or dacarbazine ( DTIC ) and/or temozolomide standard treatment patient malignant melanoma . Each subject give 7 initial injection fix dose amount . The first 4 dos give 2-week interval ( Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 6 ) ; last 3 dos give 4-week interval ( Weeks 10 , 14 , 18 ) . Those patient exhibit stable disease , partial response complete response 7 injection give 4 vaccination . Each additional 4 vaccination give 3 month apart ( Weeks 36 , 48 , 72 96 ) . Scans re-staging test perform schedule interval throughout study .</detailed_description>
