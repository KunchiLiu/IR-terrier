	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation develop test treatment word-finding problem aphasia . The treatment design strengthen meaning association within category word ( e.g. , animal , tool , fruit ) . The treatment also design use search strategy instance word-finding difficulty . The study devise evaluate extent treatment increase ability recall train , well untrained , word .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Word-Retrieval Treatment Aphasia : Semantic Feature Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose propose research examine effect semantically-oriented treatment word retrieval person aphasia . The planned investigation design development semantic feature training may serve mechanism improve disrupt lexical semantic processing , also compensatory strategy word retrieval failure . The propose research also address issue exemplar typicality ( Kiran &amp; Thompson , 2003 ) examine effect train typical versus atypical exemplar various category individual different type aphasia . A series 24 single subject experimental design conduct context group design address follow experimental question : - Will train atypical example live artifact noun category use semantic feature training result significantly different outcome* train typical example live artifact noun category ? - Will train one category nouns use semantic feature training result improve retrieval untrained category nouns ? - Will effect semantic feature training vary across aphasia type ? - Will semantic feature train result increase production content discourse ? - Will generalization untrained typical example vary across generalization list repeatedly expose limited exposure ? ( i.e. , Does repeat exposure appear contribute generalization ? ) - Outcome measure reflect acquisition , response generalization within category , response generalization across category effect treatment .</detailed_description>
