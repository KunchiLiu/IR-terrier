	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity reach epidemic proportion prevalence continue rise , even among young child . A recent report National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) reveal 1999 2002 , 10.3 % child age 2 5 overweight , increase 7 % 1994 . Epidemiologic evidence emerge suggests obesity childhood adulthood may often originate accelerated weight gain infancy . Further data accumulate link short sleep duration obesity childhood later life . Prospective data lack demonstrate whether accelerated weight gain infancy prevent whether intervention improve sleep early life prevent childhood obesity . Key Objectives : The key objective : - To adapt procedure aim prolong sleep duration infancy effective experimental setting clinical set primary care ; - To evaluate , primary care setting , effect simple training procedure overnight sleep duration rate weight gain first four month life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective proposal test , primary care setting , effect establish intervention design promote healthy feed sleep behavior early life risk factor subsequent obesity . Because nocturnal feeding infant , short sleep duration , childhood obesity link , procedure design prevent short sleep duration subsequently accelerate weight gain infancy , two emerge risk factor obesity childhood adulthood . In study , 40 participant randomize receive either intervention teach infant sleep night 8 week age standard care . The procedure instruct parent offer `` focal feed '' bedtime , avoid feed first alternative infant wake distress , carry environmental control measure emphasize day/night difference . In assess impact intervention , night wakening , rate weight gain assess birth 4 month age . The current proposal test feasibility deliver proven intervention primary care set , environment must include primary preventive strategy childhood obesity . Aim 1 : To adapt procedure aim prolong sleep duration infancy effective experimental setting clinical set primary care . This procedure , instruct parent offer `` focal feed '' bedtime , avoid feed first alternative infant wake distress , carry environmental control measure emphasize day/night difference successful prolong sleep duration experimental setting . By demonstrate subject recruit newborn nursery , taught procedure primary care visit , follow four month , feasibility large study apparent external funding agency . Aim 2 : To evaluate , primary care setting , effect simple training procedure overnight sleep duration rate weight gain first four month life . It hypothesize positive effect procedure experimental setting replicate randomize controlled trial primary care set . By definition , teach infant sleep night manifest longer sleep duration , show protective childhood obesity epidemiological study . Sleeping night hypothesize promote protective factor childhood obesity support</detailed_description>
