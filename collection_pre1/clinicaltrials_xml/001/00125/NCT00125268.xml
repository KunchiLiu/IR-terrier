	<brief_title>Near Infrared Light Treatment Painful Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain common symptom , 65-80 % , patient peripheral neuropathy . This study design evaluate effectiveness monochromatic near infrared photoenergy therapy ( MIRE ) treatment pain axonal peripheral neuropathy . This compare placebo ( sham ) device . The MIRE FDA approve , drug-free , non-invasive , medical therapeutic device use near-infrared light emit diode deliver monochromatic near infrared photoenergy ( MIRE ) contact skin . The effect MIRE believe increase local blood circulation dilate vessel reduce pain decrease local swell inflammation . MIRE also think increase local level nitric oxide ( NO ) may decrease pain level . Study subject receive treatment device placebo device 3 time per week 4 week . Response measure treatment period .</detailed_description>
