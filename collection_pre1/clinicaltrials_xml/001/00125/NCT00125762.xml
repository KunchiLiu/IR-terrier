	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES : Co –Primary Aims : - To diagnose cirrhosis patient chronic viral hepatitis B C ; - To determine correlation FibroScan measurement Metavir liver fibrosis score differentiate no/mild fibrosis ( F0-F1 ) severe fibrosis ( F2-F4 ) . STUDY DESIGN : This multi-center study FibroScan measurement collect prospectively patient chronic hepatitis B C virus present liver biopsy . The study duration 12 month . The study initially 3 investigational site United States . Up 3 investigational site may identify participate trial . Study Sites : Initially follow three site participate trial : Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC : Keyur Patel , M.D . ; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA : Nezam H. Afdhal , M.D . ; St. Louis University , St. Louis , MO : Bruce R. Bacon M.D . Study Population : Subjects chronic liver disease secondary chronic hepatitis C hepatitis B , undergo liver biopsy standard care disease , eligible study . Subjects hepatitis C , co-infected infectious viral disease , hepatitis B HIV-1 , , may also candidate study enrollment provide inclusion/exclusion criterion meet . The subject must schedule liver biopsy either prior treatment ( treatment naïve ) , previously treat , must treatment least three ( 3 ) month . The time date FibroScan reading date biopsy must exceed six ( 6 ) month . Sample Size : A total 300 evaluable patient ( male female ) enrol study . Enrollment consider competitive allow one center enroll 150 patient meeting study criterion meet goal 300 subject . Sample size base prevalence 20 % cirrhosis . Subject Inclusion Criteria : - Subject able give inform consent study agree provide blood sample . - Subject must least 18 year age . - Subject liver biopsy chronic liver disease , secondary HBV HCV within 6 month FibroScan ( experimental cohort 1 ) . - Subjects hepatitis C ( HCV ) hepatitis B ( HBV ) treatment naïve interferon therapy nucleoside/nucleotide analog HBV minimum 3 month prior FibroScan liver biopsy . Subject Exclusion Criteria : - Unable unwilling provide inform consent . - Confirmed diagnosis and/or history malignancy , terminal disease . - Uninterpretable biopsy specimen . - Missing critical clinical , biochemical and/or demographic information . - Receiving anti-viral therapy infection HCV HBV within 3 month prior FibroScan liver biopsy . - Subject chronic liver disease , include Wilson ’ disease , alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency , cholestatic liver disease , hemochromatosis . - Patient clinical ascites - Patients morbid obesity define body mass index ( BMI ) great equal 40 . - Patients pregnant - Patients implantable cardiac device defibrillator pacemaker SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS TESTING : A minimum 8 valid measurement obtain subject right lobe liver . The tip probe transducer cover couple gel place skin , rib level right lobe liver . The operator , assist ultrasonic time motion image , locate portion liver least 4cm thick free large vascular structure . The depth measurement 25 mm 65 mm . During acquisition subject lie back right arm behind head , similar position use liver biopsy . The physician take measurement probe place intercostal space . The median value estimate kept elasticity value liver give patient . The entire examination last approximately 5 minute .</detailed_description>
