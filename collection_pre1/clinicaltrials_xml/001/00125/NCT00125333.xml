	<brief_title>Topical NF-kappaB Decoy Treatment Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , dose-ranging study evaluate safety repeat application three concentration NF-kappaB Decoy approximately 75 subject mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis . The face , hand , foot , scalp , groin may NOT treat . Other treatment agent currently available atopic dermatitis present significant potential side effect ( topical steroid ) potent immunosuppressive ( topical calcineurin inhibitor ) pending longer-term safety data . NF-kappaB Decoy double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) oligodeoxynucleotide mimic NF-kappaB bind sequence chromosomal DNA , thereby inhibit production inflammatory response trigger NF-kappaB . This mechanism action present unique treatment modality . A comprehensive series nonclinical data produce promising result .</detailed_description>
