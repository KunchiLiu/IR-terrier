	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether adjunctional interferon alfa structure treatment interruption correlate long time treatment HIV-1 infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structured Treatment Interruptions With Without Pegylated Interferon Alpha HIV-Infected Patients After Prolonged Viral Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The limitation drug use HIV include toxicity , tolerability , propensity induce resistance take absolute regularity cost . Treatment interruption patient receive antiretroviral treatment set chronic infection associate viral rebound rapid CD4 T cell decrease conduct antiretroviral therapy restart . In patient high CD4+ cell count ( patient receive treatment chronic infection control viremia patient receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) treatment would start base current guideline ) , investigator evaluate whether adjunctional interferon alfa 2b 3 structured treatment interruption correlate long time treatment . HAART interrupt 4 week , restart continued 12 week . After 3 cycle treatment indefinitely suspend 48 week study entry . Another aim study assess immunological virological factor associate duration treatment interruption ( proviral HIV DNA baseline follow-up , plasma HIV RNA baseline follow-up , CD4 T cell CD8 T cell HIV specific response baseline 6 month interruption ) .</detailed_description>
