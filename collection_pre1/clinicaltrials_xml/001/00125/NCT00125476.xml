	<brief_summary>This study prospective follow-up study Dose-Response Exercise Women ( DREW ) study . In DREW , 450 overweight , sedentary postmenopausal woman randomly assign either non-exercise control group 1 3 weekly physical activity group . The DREW study evaluate dose-response exercise training regard change multiple cardiac risk factor . This study measure diastolic heart function subset DREW population order examine relationship dose response , change physical activity , diastolic function . Diastolic heart function assess use traditional novel echocardiographic measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) become number one reason hospitalization United States . Diastolic heart dysfunction become increasingly recognize significant factor etiology CHF . Of total affected population , 70 % patient diastolic heart failure female , majority elderly . There currently effective pharmacological therapy treatment diastolic heart dysfunction . Existing cross-sectional study limit training trial support hypothesis exercise may improve diastolic function study men . There need properly control adequately powered study examine effect exercise training diastolic function , particularly population high risk CHF , sedentary , postmenopausal woman elevate blood pressure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 215 sedentary , postmenopausal woman moderate risk cardiovascular disease randomly assign receive either exercise training exercise six month . This study measure diastolic heart function use novel echocardiographic measurement , pulmonary vein flow pattern , tissue Doppler , color M-mode mitral inflow propagation velocity . The study also measure leave ventricular mass .</detailed_description>
