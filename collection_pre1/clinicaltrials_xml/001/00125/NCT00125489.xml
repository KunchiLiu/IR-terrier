In preparation longer study malaria treatment medication chloroquine alone combination drug , short pre-study do compare anti-malarial effectiveness chloroquine versus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) , standard treatment Malawi . Two hundred ten child , age 6 month 12 year , around Blantyre , Malawi , give standard dose either chloroquine SP come Ndirande Health Centre sign symptom consistent malaria .

	<brief_title>CQSP Malawi : Chloroquine Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Efficacy Treatment Malaria Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow observation chloroquine-resistant malaria may return Malawi , 10 year use eliminate . There grow consensus combination chemotherapy rule malaria treatment deter development drug resistance possibly also decrease malaria transmission . As sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) failure rate increase , reintroduction chloroquine Malawi combination highly effective rapidly act drug artesunate chlorproguanil-dapsone consider , would likely extend useful life span drug . In preparation longitudinal clinical trial chloroquine alone SP combination drug , preliminary trial conduct compare anti-malarial efficacy chloroquine versus SP , standard treatment Malawi . This randomized , open-label clinical trial compare antimalarial efficacy chloroquine versus SP among child uncomplicated malaria Blantyre , Malawi . In study , 210 peri-urban child randomly assign receive standard dose either chloroquine SP . Follow consist visit day 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 , accord standard World Health Organization protocol . Because chloroquine use treat malaria Malawi decade , special safety precaution take begin study . The first 30 participant arm remain Health Centre continuous observation medical staff monitor response therapy afebrile 12 hour two consecutive negative 12-hourly blood smear . Observation inpatient setting also help avoid potential bias due intense follow-up hospitalize group . A Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) meet first 30 participant enrol arm determine study stop continuous observation proceed out-patient follow . All participant follow 28 day monitor late therapeutic parasitologic failure . The primary study objective ass efficacy chloroquine compare standard SP therapy , treat malaria Malawi , chloroquine use 10 year compare efficacy standard therapy SP . The secondary study objective assess effect re-introduction chloroquine molecular marker associate chloroquine resistance . The primary study endpoint rate adequate clinical parasitologic response therapy . The secondary study endpoint : ( 1 ) rate early late therapeutic failure ; ( 2 ) rate early late parasitologic failure ; ( 3 ) prevalence chloroquine-resistance confer pfcrt K76T mutation pre-treatment infection ; ( 4 ) rate pre- post-treatment pfcrt K76T mutation case chloroquine treatment failure ; ( 5 ) prevalence SP-resistance conferring dhfr/dhps mutation pre-treatment infection ; ( 6 ) rate pre- post-treatment dhfr/dhps mutation case SP treatment failure ; ( 7 ) clearance time parasitemia ; ( 8 ) clearance time fever ; ( 9 ) presence post-treatment anemia .</detailed_description>
