	<brief_summary>The treatment patient malignant brain tumor disappoint . The disease incurable virtually patient die disease . Despite devastating nature illness affect age group , cause remains unexplained . Family identification careful clinical molecular study lead discovery gene cause number devastating disease like retinoblastoma , cystic fibrosis , Huntington 's chorea . The investigator propose study genetic change patient familial glioma first step identify gene ( ) cause tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study genetic change patient familial glioma first step identify gene ( ) cause tumor . With informed consent , DNAs tumor non-tumor tissue , histologic section , pedigree detail clinical information acquire patient familial glioma . A genomic screening methodology name 2D genomic scanning use . Differences detect tumor normal tissue ( blood , fibroblast ) identify event occur tumoral process . A comparison event familial sporadic glioma outline pathway suspect involved tumor initiation progression . Briefly , DNA fragment amplify polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) tumor normal tissue use primer design identify 100 1000 random site within genome . The PCR primer hybridize throughout genome generate manageable number short PCR product detect gel electrophoresis autoradiography . The PCR tumor constitutional tissue amplify 20 25 cycle ensure adequate signal avoid enter non-exponential phase PCR amplification . The product radiolabelled run standard sequence gel . The single lane contain label PCR product cut overlaid onto denature grade gel 10 75 % grade denaturant . The labelled DNA separate second dimension DNA detect Southern Transfer nylon membrane gel-drying direct exposure film . A direct comparison PCR signal tumor constitutional tissue identifies loss gain signal reflect phenomenon within genome . The isolation characterization fragment consistently alter glioma provide first step search gene responsible initiation progression glioma . Because collaboration among investigator different centre Canada , current investigator unique opportunity perform study large collection familial glioma world . They expect several genomic abnormality tumor . Some may see several patient . Data analyze primarily use descriptive statistic , frequency genetic abnormality different chromosomal location describe .</detailed_description>
