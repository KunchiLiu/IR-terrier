	<brief_title>Evaluation Effects Response Elaboration Training Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Extended description protocol , include information already contain field , comparison ( ) study . Example : Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOH-CA ) remain significant cause death , spite recent decline overall mortality cardiovascular disease . Existing method emergency resuscitation inadequate due time delay inherent transport train responder defibrillation capability side OOH-CA victim . Existing Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) system typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical Technician ( EMT ) service level community involvement , bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) training . Some community include automated external defibrillator ( AEDs ) isolate site mobile police fire vehicle . A comprehensive , integrate community approach treatment AEDs would community unit serve volunteer non-medical responder quickly identify treat patient OOH-CA . Such approach term Public Access Defibrillation ( PAD ) . Comparison ( ) : Community unit train equipped provide public access defibrillation addition optimal standard care , compare community unit train provide optimal standard care ( recognition out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , 911 access , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) . The purpose propose research thoroughly evaluate effect Response Elaboration Training ( RET ) person aphasia . Specifically , propose research investigation design delineate outcome may expect RET . The study also design improve outcome area stimulus generalization effect treatment test modification RET design facilitate generalization . The specific experimental question address follow : - Will RET result increase production correct information unit increase length change composition utterance measure *trained untrained picture description ; *story retell ; *conversations significant others/family members/friends ; *personal recount ? - Will modification extension RET additional training context result increase production CIUs increase length complexity utterance ? - Will effects* RET vary among participant fluent aphasia , participant nonfluent aphasia present mild moderate verbal production deficit , participant nonfluent aphasia present severe verbal production deficit ? * Effects = effect production CIUs measure functional communication - Will change measure functional communication observe follow administration RET ? A series single-subject experimental design across subject , behavior , context conduct address question . Twenty-four adult chronic , moderate severe aphasia secondary unilateral , left-hemisphere brain-injury serve participant investigation .</detailed_description>
