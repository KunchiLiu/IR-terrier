	<brief_title>Internally Versus Externally Guided Body Weight-Supported Treadmill Training ( BWSTT ) Locomotor Recovery Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , test two form locomotor train gait rehabilitation person post-stroke : traditional locomotor training ( partial body-weight support manual assistance therapist ) vs. robotic-assisted locomotor training ( partial body-weight support robotic guidance Lokomat ) . We enrol 16 person chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) hemiparesis post-stroke randomized traditional/manual robotic locomotor training . All individual receive 12 session ( thrice weekly four week ) training . Each session involve 30 minute step . The complete study result publish .</detailed_description>
