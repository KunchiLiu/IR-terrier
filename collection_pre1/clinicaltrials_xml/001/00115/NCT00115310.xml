	<detailed_description>This study 12-week randomize , double-blind , control multi-center evaluation efficacy , safety tolerability NGX-4010 treatment PHN . Eligible subject moderate severe pain PHN , average NPRS score screen 3 9 ( inclusive ) . Painful area 1000 square centimeter treat single treatment administration study . Subjects randomly assign receive active NGX-4010 patch low-concentration control patch identical appearance , accord 1:1 allocation scheme . Subjects may stable chronic oral pain medication regimen , currently use topical pain medication affect area . NPRS score average pain past 24 hour record daily even , begin day Screening Visit ( usually Day -14 ) . Subjects continue record NPRS score take-home diary evening day treatment even Termination Visit Week 12 .
