	<brief_title>Efficacy Tenofovir-Emtricitabine Efavirenz HIV Infected Patients With Tuberculosis ( ANRS129 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research consist conduct pilot trial `` BKVIR '' design answer question whether daily tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz triple-agent therapy effective well tolerate must initiate within three month initiation three-agent four-agent tuberculostatic therapy antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patient . As propose pilot trial comprise initiation antiretroviral therapy three month follow initiation tuberculostatic therapy , propose set systematic , continuous registration HIV-infected patient diagnosis tuberculosis participate center study period order evaluate eligibility inclusion pilot trial . The initial declaration phase register , addition facilitate inclusion pilot trial , also allow : 1 ) good understanding reason non-inclusion trial , allow eligibility criterion adjust necessary trial ; 2 ) describe antiretroviral therapy use co-infection time initiation relation tuberculostatic therapy . This research expect contribute updating treatment guideline context tuberculosis HIV-infected patient . The data collect constitute unique database issue France , also internationally , also useful optimize management strategy two disease develop country .</detailed_description>
