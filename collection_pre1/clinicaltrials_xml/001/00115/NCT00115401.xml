	<brief_summary>This study collect information different way people walk , , gait , use ankle brace . Patients visit NIH least three many nine separate occasion . A physical therapist perform physical examination determine patient move , strong comfortable walk speed . Then patient sit chair camera apparatus take special picture leg , procedure last 2 hour . Patients ask return learn walk custom Passive Dynamic Ankle-Foot Orthosis ( PD-AFO ) -a unique ankle brace design improve walk ability provide natural support lower limb . Patients 4 old good health able walk repeatedly distance 15 meter ( approximately 49 foot ) independently unsupervised may eligible study . With training , patient may return several time learn walk brace , protection , allow take use outside research team 's supervision . The researcher examine leg ensure brace fit ask question . Each training visit require 1.5 hour . When patient learn walk brace , ask visit walk scientific picture take leg . During walk test , patient wear T-shirts short . Patients ' arm legs wrapped soft , rubber-like material , allow small plastic reflective ball attach . Firm material know shell attach rubber sleeve , Velcro self-sticking bandage . The small ball may also attach skin , adhesive . Also , may test muscle , use electromyography , EMG . The test involve attachment small metal electrode surface skin , adhesive . There discomfort test . As patient walk several time , scientific camera record position reflective ball . Pictures involve patient ' face part body . Afterward , unique chair system call Biodex measure leg muscle strength . Patients ask sit chair place leg foot apparatus , special structure measure strength . They repeatedly push apparatus , 3 second . Each time patient push , researcher touch small magnetic device skin , cause muscle push harder . Although procedure cause discomfort , may feel unusual . If wish , patient ask stop test time . Few risk involve participate series activity . There slight chance mild skin irritation adhesive use skin soft , rubber-like material . But material worn brief period , skin reaction rare . Also , material may feel tight , cause discomfort prevents move , patient ask researcher adjust . There slight chance skin irritation use PD-AFO , adjustment make make patient comfortable . Patients may experience muscle soreness cause participate muscle strength test . However , safely monitor physical therapist try brace adjust feel fit , well test gait . This study direct benefit participant . However , participant pay time , minimum compensation $ 50 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Adaptations Passive Dynamic Ankle-Foot Orthosis Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle-Foot Orthoses common form ankle joint brace prescribed patient impair joint function . Passive Dynamic Ankle-Foot Orthoses ( PD-AFOs ) constitute special class ankle brace design enhance gait function provide natural support lower limb progress stance foot . However , fundamental design characteristic PD-AFOs capable replicate dynamic characteristic natural ankle complex . As result , efficient use PD-AFOs gait require wearer develop adapt , low limb movement control strategy effectively optimize positive PD-AFO characteristic compensate characteristic detrimental gait function . The long term goal research effort predict patient 's ability adapt PD-AFO use customize PD-AFO characteristic optimize adaptation . The purpose series study refine exist method construct custom PD-AFOs document movement control adaptation produce normal healthy strength impaired subject response PD-AFO use . The research plan comprise three phase : technology refinement ( pilot ) effort ( n=5 ) , normal subject study ( n=10 ) , impaired subject study ( n=20 ) . During technology refinement phase , refine exist method PD-AFO customization pilot test PD-AFO accommodation gait train method movement control assessment measurement . The normal impaired subject study use document PD-AFO use strength substitution paradigm ( normal subject study ) strength enhancement paradigm ( impaired subject study ) . Subjects study phase participate three visit type . Initially , subject participate screen PD-AFO tune visit contains neuromuscular screen examination , preferred walk speed test , measurement custom fit PD-AFO . Following manufacture custom PD-AFO , subject return PD-AFO receipt accommodation train visit . During visit , PD-AFO customize evaluated comfort performance subject undergo supervise gait train PD-AFO use . Following successful accommodation PD-AFO use , subject return third visit undergo instrument gait analysis three condition ( target walk velocity without PD-AFO , self select walk velocity PD-AFO , target walk velocity PD-AFO ) finally , objective plantarflexor strength test . Walking velocity statistically compare without PD-AFO condition determine accommodation effect self select condition test difference target walk condition . The magnitude peak natural ankle plantarflexion moment statistically compare determine efficacy strength substitution strength enhancement paradigm . The nature extent movement control adaptation explore contrast various biomechanical ( kinematic kinetic ) variables without PD-AFO condition congruent walk speed . Results neurological examination objective strength test use rationalize existence different movement control adaptation subject form basis develop initial predictive model .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : This study include healthy male females four year age . The study involve healthy volunteer normal low extremity strength profile healthy volunteer impair ankle joint plantarflexion strength . For project , term healthy define lack systemic disease alters ability subject participate activity choice . In addition , healthy mean current pathology possibility damage muscle , ligament , cartilage low extremity . An attempt make obtain equal distribution male female . In addition , participation minority strongly encourage use exist outreach program . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must capable repeatedly walk 15m independently unsupervised . They must cooperative able follow command adequate natural step stride lengths step three force plat series . Subjects must combine low limb size ( shank foot ) result PDAFO size within prototyping capacity ( 50 cm ) selective laser sintering machine . To participate impaired study , subject must manual muscle strength score plantarflexion strength less equal three five point scale . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects unsafe highly variable gait pattern upon visual observation exclude . Subjects unable repeatedly walk data collection volume without use assistive device exclude . In addition , subject pain related walking impaired skin sensation ( touch pressure ) exclude . Subjects low extremity muscle spasticity 3 great Ashworth Scale exclude . Subjects history injury , surgery , disease affect function low extremity exclude normal study . Subjects exclude participation normal study muscle strength joint range motion measure outside normal limit .</criteria>
