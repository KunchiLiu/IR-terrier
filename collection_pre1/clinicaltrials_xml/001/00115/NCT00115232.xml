	<detailed_description>Family history well know risk factor early atherosclerosis . Whether inflammation play role increase risk family history know . In prospective single-center study , recruit child without family history premature atherosclerotic disease , define occur &lt; 55 year males &lt; 65 year females . Children recruit primarily pediatric preventive cardiology clinic Children 's Hospital Boston . We measure anthropomorphic characteristic , fast lipid profile inflammatory marker level , include high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) , P-selectin , tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 2 ( TNFÎ±R2 ) . In sample high-risk overweight child , Lp ( ) inflammatory marker could reflect cardiovascular risk outside lipid profile .</detailed_description>
