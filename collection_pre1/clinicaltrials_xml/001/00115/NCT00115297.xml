	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma large impact child society . It among common chronic disease childhood lead cause absenteeism school . It unknown child recurrent episodes wheeze child asthma others . There increase evidence difference innate immune response among child determine child recurrent wheeze asthma . While many study focus factor initiate innate immune response , relatively study downstream factor cause abnormal airway response . There evidence eicosanoid mediator part innate immune response function effector arm allergic response . The ability leukotrienes prostaglandin produce central feature asthma phenotype well describe emerge evidence lipoxins facilitate restoration allergic change airways . This study test hypothesis balance airway eicosanoid expression early-life wheezing illness genetically determine capacity respond predict recurrent wheezing . Moreover , intervention restore normal tissue response imbalance reduce symptom early-life wheeze subsequent recurrent episode . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study effect montelukast duration wheeze child 12 month 3 year age care physician wheezing illness . Study treatment give 56 day . Participants 2 3 year old receive either 5-mg montelukast tablet match placebo . Participants 12 month 2 year old receive 4-mg montelukast granule match placebo . The primary outcome parameter study number day infant observed free wheeze primary caregiver . The secondary outcome parameter number wheeze episodes treatment period rate recurrent wheeze follow-up period . The study , consortium arrangement Brigham Women 's Hospital Hacettepe University Medical Center Turkey , recruit child Ankara area Hacettepe University Medical Center Turkey . This study one three , include : 1 ) measure airway eicosanoid profile pediatric `` wheeze '' patient 3 month 3 year old ; 2 ) determine genetic variant eicosanoid metabolic response pathway associate recurrent wheezing ; 3 ) determine intervention montelukast ( singulair ) affect symptoms rate recurrent wheezing .</detailed_description>
