Subjects recruit prenatal clinic serve primarily low-income , minority population . Two hundred sixty-eight pregnant smoker randomly assign receive smoking cessation behavioral counseling either 6-week course mint flavor placebo nicotine gum , follow 6 week decrease dos . Maternal blood genotyping obtain study entry . Primary outcome measure 7-day point prevalence cigarette abstinence , number cigarette smoke per day , urinary cotinine concentration , measure tobacco exposure ( i.e. , carbon monoxide exhale air urine anabasine anatabine ) 6 week quit date 32-34 week gestation , infant birth weight . We hypothesize : - ( 1 ) Pregnant smoker randomize nicotine gum double quit rate reduce smoke great degree subject randomize placebo ; - ( 2 ) Nicotine gum compare placebo reduce maternal level tobacco-exposure marker increase birth weight offspring ; - ( 3 ) The odds cigarette abstinence increase primarily subject smoke least 15 cigarette per day .</detailed_description>
