	<brief_title>Effects Aerobic Exercise Versus Weight Training Breast Cancer Survivors During Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , three-armed , randomize control trial . Participants stratify site ( Edmonton , Ottawa , Vancouver ) plan chemotherapy protocol ( taxane-based versus nontaxane-based ) randomly assign AET , RET , usual care ( UC ) 1:1:1 ratio use random-numbers table . Participants assign AET group ask perform aerobic exercise three time per week recumbent upright cycle ergometer , treadmill , elliptical . Exercise duration begin 15 minute week 0 2 , systematically increase 5 minute every three week thereafter 45 minute week 18 beyond . Exercise intensity begin 60 % VO2max week 0 2 systematically increase 10 % every 6 week thereafter 80 % VO2max week 12 beyond . Warm-up cool-down period consist 5 minute aerobic activity power output ventilatory equivalent oxygen ( approximately 50 % peak oxygen consumption ) . Participants assign RET group ask perform resistance exercise three time per week , consist two set 10 repetition 9 different exercise perform 60-70 % 1-repetition maximum . The specific exercise : leg extension , leg curl , calf raise , chest press , latissimus pulldown , overhead press , triceps extension , biceps curl , modify curl-ups . Resistance increase approximately 10 % next weight level participant able complete 12 repetition per set without difficulty .</detailed_description>
