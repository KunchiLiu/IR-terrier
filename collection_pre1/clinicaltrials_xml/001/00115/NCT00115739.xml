	<brief_summary>Anaplastic thyroid cancer rare , aggressive tumor . Standard treatment option include surgery chemoradiation . Few treatment option available metastasis develop . Recent data suggest Imatinib ( Gleevec ) may advantageous patient population . Patients treat anaplastic thyroid cancer chemoradiation surgery develop recurrent metastatic disease outside field radiation eligible . Patients treat Imatinib 400 mg two time day eight week , follow radiologic assessment . Patients treat disease progression complete response obtain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Gleevec Patients With Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( ATC ) high grade neoplasm , account approximately 2 % 5 % primary malignant thyroid tumor 50 % thyroid cancer death . Because therapy anaplastic thyroid carcinoma limit even early stage disease , new approach treat devastate cancer need . Recently , imatinib mesylate ( GleevecÂ® ) , formerly know STI571 , approve treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment gastrointestinal stromal tumor , express c-Kit tyrosine kinase . Imatinib also inhibitor receptor tyrosine kinases platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) stem cell factor , c-Kit , inhibit PDGF- SCF-mediated cellular event . Recent data suggest many , anaplastic thyroid cancer express PDGF receptor , receptor functional . Additional preclinical work Japan demonstrate c-Abl overexpressed p53 mutated/deficient anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line select inhibition c-Abl activity STI571 dramatic cytostatic effect cell . Additional data suggest many , , anaplastic thyroid cancer express PDGF receptor , receptor functional . Since activation PDGF receptor associate growth tumor c-Abl overexpressed p53-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line , seem appropriate test Gleevec therapy patient anaplastic thyroid cancer . The specific hypothesis test anaplastic thyroid cancer overexpress PDGF receptor Abl respond Gleevec therapy . The lack accept efficacious therapy anaplastic thyroid cancer , poor prognosis cancer , relatively low toxicity Gleevec justify propose trial . Patients anaplastic thyroid carcinoma status post best local control surgery/chemoradiation , measurable disease outside previous field radiation , eligible . The Primary Objective study : 1 . To determine overall response ( complete partial response ) rate patient anaplastic thyroid cancer treat Gleevec first response assessment ( i.e . 8 week follow start Gleevec ) , follow best local control surgery radiation/chemoradiation . The Secondary Objectives include : 1 . To measure grade III/IV toxicity experience patient anaplastic thyroid cancer treat Gleevec . 2 . To determine time obtain complete partial response patient anaplastic thyroid cancer treat Gleevec , follow best local control surgery radiation/chemoradiation . Treatment Plan : Patients treat Imatinib ( Gleevec ) 400 mg two time day eight week radiologic image obtained assess response . Patients attain complete response treat four additional week Imatinib . Patients attain partial response stable disease treat complete response attain , disease progression . All patient progression disease take study . Patients continue study , undergo radiologic image every eight week follow initial response assessment . All patient follow death .</detailed_description>
