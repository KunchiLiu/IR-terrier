	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare new higher-dose influenza virus vaccine standard dose vaccine elderly adult walk . Current influenza vaccine protect elderly viral influenza well desire . It expect high dos vaccine give little reaction , need test . Up 410 people age 65 year older recruit community exist volunteer population . Participants receive either high standard dose injected muscle , remain clinic 20 minute afterward , maintain daily memory aid 7 day . The memory aid review telephone 8-12 day injection return clinic contact telephone 6 month injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza common respiratory infection cause several related virus . Epidemics influenza occur winter responsible average 36,000 deaths year United States . Most deaths occur among elderly person among people age suffer chronic disease , particularly lungs heart . Current influenza virus vaccine protect elderly person influenza , well desire . One consideration try increase protection increase vaccine dose , concern increase dose may increase reaction vaccine ( sore arm , ache , fever ) . One vaccine manufacturer prepare experimental influenza virus vaccine dose higher currently use dose . A previous study high dose vaccine show well tolerate increase reaction injection site compare usual vaccine . Since study , high-dose vaccine also make without preservative ( thimerosal ) gelatin , standard vaccine . It expect vaccine give little reaction , need determine . It also need show whether vaccine stimulate high level infection-fighting protein ( antibody ) blood standard dose influenza vaccine . The purpose research compare reaction antibody response follow standard flu vaccine follow experimental vaccine . Up 410 people age 65 year older recruit community exist volunteer population . Participants receive either high standard dose injected muscle , remain clinic 20 minute afterward , maintain daily memory aid 7 day . The memory aid review telephone 8-12 day injection return clinic contact telephone 6 month injection . This study link DMID protocol 05-0028 .</detailed_description>
