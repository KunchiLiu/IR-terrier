	<brief_title>Ketorolac Versus Ibuprofen Treat Painful Episodes Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : SCD common disorder among African Americans minority group . It characterize chronic anemia episodic vaso-occlusive crisis . The common crisis painful crisis . Current treatment painful crisis include rest , hydration , analgesic medication . Morphine commonly prescribe analgesic medication moderate severe painful episode , several side effect associate use , include somnolence , respiratory depression , constipation , dysphoria , pruritus . Other analgesic medication , include NSAIDs , may improve pain control decrease need morphine opioid drug ; however , research need confirm benefit individual SCD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study enroll 120 child receive standard opioid supportive therapy . In addition care , participant randomly assign receive one following : 1 ) intravenous ketorolac oral placebo ; 2 ) intravenous placebo oral ibuprofen . Outcome assessment include duration hospitalization opioid therapy ; degree pain intensity relief determine validated pain scale ; utilization opioid medication hospitalization . All participant monitor potential adverse effect study medication laboratory measurement clinical assessment . Additionally , participant self-report pain level use Oucher pain scale . Participants monitor development adverse event , include gastrointestinal symptom deterioration kidney function , determine daily kidney function test include BUN , creatinine , hematuria .</detailed_description>
