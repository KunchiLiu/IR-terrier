	<brief_summary>This study evaluate genetic makeup contribute variation people regard sensitivity experience pain . Scientists believe difference information find gene may explain analgesic drug , , one treat pain , work effectively people others . The study explore pain acute ( fast short period ) . Knowledge gain ongoing study may permit development individualize analgesic drug prescription . Patients age 16 35 good health refer removal impacted wisdom teeth ; allergic aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( know NSAIDs ) , sulfites , certain anesthetic ; pregnant nursing ; willing biopsy dental surgery eligible study . Patients come clinic one test visit one treatment visit . During first visit , questionnaire evaluate patient ' psychological state , include mood depression . There clinical examination wisdom teeth . A blood sample 10 milliliter ( 0.4 ounce ) collect forearm provide DNA material contain gene store cell . The primary genetic analysis do NIH , although DNA collect might also send laboratory outside NIH . DNA sample cod name patient trace . During second visit , two patient ' low wisdom teeth remove . Patients give local anesthetic mouth sedative give vein arm . While mouth numb , small piece tissue remove inside cheek , near wisdom tooth . It first biopsy . After two wisdom teeth remove , small piece tubing place side mouth teeth remove . Every 20 minute , next 3 hour , researcher collect inflammatory fluid tubing , measure chemical think cause pain swell . Also every 20 minute , patient rate pain feel answer question . If pain 3 hour follow surgery , receive dose fentanyl relieve moderate severe pain . A second biopsy occur 3 hour surgery , measure change chemical produce response surgery . Immediately afterward , patient receive 30 mg ketorolac ( Toradol ) whether pain felt . They answer questionnaire pain 3 hour receive drug , rate well work . They stay clinic 6 hour surgery . If pain relieve ketorolac , patient receive one-time dose tramadol , pain medication moderate severe pain . After study procedure complete , patient receive pain medication pain surgery . Patients monitor closely , drug side effect . Ketorolac nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , one may cause gastrointestinal upset . Fentanyl powerful narcotic drug safe dosage use study , stomach upset , dizziness , breathe trouble may occur . Also , risk biopsy include discomfort inject numbing medicine , infection , bleed . There may discomfort sedative inject vein , may bruise . Benefits participate wisdom teeth remove cost well close monitoring surgery . There plan give patient result genetic test questionnaire . Years research may need information chance become meaningful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Basis For Variation In NSAID Analgesia In A Clinical Model Of Acute Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial evaluate role genetic factor include single nucleotide polymorphism cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 2 gene acute pain tissue injury analgesic effect COX inhibitor . Patients healthy volunteer schedule surgical removal impact third molar . Genotyping perform surgery patient stratify treatment COX inhibitor protocol protocols examine different polymorphism . Under local anesthesia , 2 mandibular third molar remove . Microdialysis sample extraction socket perform pre- post-surgical biopsy . Patients receive COX inhibitor analgesic drug post-operative pain . Outcomes evaluated include clinical pain response , gene expression profile use microarray quantitation relate proteins oral surgery interaction factor analgesia COX inhibitor . By study response patient sample genotype ( non-variant homozygote , heterozygote variant homozygote ) COX-2 gene , attempt replicate extend previous finding role genetic factor inflammatory process , clinical pain variation response analgesic drug .</detailed_description>
