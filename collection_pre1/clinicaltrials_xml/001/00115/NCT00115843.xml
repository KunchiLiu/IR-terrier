	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Rate Control Therapy Guided By Continuous Ambulatory Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , randomize control trial compare standard rate-control strategy one use Cardionet device guide therapy management atrial fibrillation . Patients present outpatient clinic Emergency Department atrial fibrillation ventricular rate great 100 bpm rest enrol . Treatment : Patients prescribed either beta blocker calcium channel blocker , baseline dose increase already take one agent discretion treat physician . This consistent standard outpatient treatment guideline rate control atrial fibrillation . Randomization : At time enrollment , patient randomized standard rate control protocol rate-control protocol guide Cardionet device . Standard Care ( Comparison Group ) : Patients randomize standard care home patient educator install Cardionet device within 24 hour enrollment . The Cardionet device use adjudicate primary endpoint adequate rate control standard care group . The patient 's treat physician blind report Cardionet device . These patient another office visit initial refer physician staff cardiologist within first week enrollment weekly thereafter . At time , adequacy rate control assess standard 12-lead electrocardiogram patient history . Medication adjust per protocol . The patient see weekly basis adequate rate control think achieve . Rate Control use Cardionet ( Study Group ) : Patients randomize use Cardionet device home patient educator install device within 24 hour enrollment . Electrocardiographic summary review research physician three time week treatment decision make base summary 24-hour rate control . The physician contact patient telephone make medication adjustment per protocol . Three-times-weekly transmission medication adjustment continue adequate rate control achieve period 24 hour .</detailed_description>
