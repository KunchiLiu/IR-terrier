	<detailed_description>Naltrexone establish efficacious medication treat alcohol dependence study thus far focus mostly acute phase treatment rather long-term management offer alternative treatment strategy patient respond initial course naltrexone . For initial non-responders naltrexone , unclear adjustment treatment make increase likelihood treatment success . We unaware previous research focus specifically naltrexone non-response . Pilot data ongoing trial center , however , suggest third patient fail respond naltrexone . Moreover , non-responsive patient go worst outcomes next 6 month treatment maintain combination naltrexone medication management ( MM ) . We propose augment medication management combination motivational enhancement therapy cognitive behavioral therapy ( combined behavioral intervention - CBI ) test benefit continued/discontinued treatment naltrexone randomize placebo-controlled trial . Clinical strategy second line treatment often favor switch treatment rather augmentation . However , may synergies naltrexone CBI apparent medication management . Specifically , CBI may advantage motivate patient great medication adherence ( lead cause naltrexone treatment failure ) CBI may address psychosocial factor limit attenuated effect naltrexone .</detailed_description>
