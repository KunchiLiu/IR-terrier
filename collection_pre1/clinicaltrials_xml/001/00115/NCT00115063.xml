	<detailed_description>LOSS pragmatic clinical trial design evaluate intensive medical treatment patient severe obesity would otherwise qualify candidate obesity surgery cover Louisiana Office Group Benefits ( OGB ) Health Insurance . LOSS track efficacy , safety cost compare two patient management approach - intensive medical treatment , usual medical care treatment model . Recruitment do mailer insured patient identify eligible candidate . We randomly assign eligible volunteer intensive medical treatment ( n=240 ) usual care ( n=240 ) . Patients evaluate annually medical treatment give eight clinic around Louisiana . The eight site Alexandria , Baton Rouge , Lafayette , Lake Charles , Monroe , Hammond , New Orleans Shreveport . Hypothesis : We hypothesize achieve weight loss two five year exceed 20 % baseline intensive medical management person class III obesity weight loss great achieve usual medical care include access weight management web site . Our secondary hypothesis : 1 ) weight loss year 2 5 intensive medical group associate improvement blood pressure , fast glucose , lipid , health-related quality life psychosocial measure great improvement achieve usual medical care access website ; 2 ) total medical cost intensive medical management group compare favorably total medical cost usual care group ( i.e. , total reimbursement insurance cost less , even expense treatment consider ) . Overall Aim : The overarch aim study observe effect intensive medical management program versus usual care class III obesity weight loss , total medical cost , measure health risk associate weight loss ( blood pressure , blood glucose , blood lipid , health-related quality life ) . Specific Aims : Primary : The primary specific aim LOSS study test hypothesis weight loss efficacy year 2 5 intensive medical treatment program Class III obesity produce great weight loss , compare condition usual care . Secondary : The secondary aim study : - To evaluate percent change body weight , absolute change body weight ( kilogram ) percent excess weight lose baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 medically treat patient group , year 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 group . - To evaluate number proportion subject maintain 100 % 80 % 12 month weight lose month 24 , 36 , 48 60 medically treat patient year 2 , 3 , 4 5 group . - To evaluate change baseline blood pressure , pulse rate , efficacy laboratory parameter visit month 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 medically treated patient group , year 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 group . - To assess safety tolerability intervention regimens month 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 medically treated patient group . - To assess total medical cost participant treat intensive medical treatment patient receive usual care year 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 . - To assess additional psychosocial economic measure ( health-related quality life , pain , depression , stress ) intervention group month 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month group year 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . - To compare subgroups patient class III obesity determine difference outcome exist gender , race , education level , decade age presence co-morbid condition .
