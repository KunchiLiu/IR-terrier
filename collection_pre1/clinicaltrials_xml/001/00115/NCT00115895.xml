	<brief_summary>The thyroid cell take iodine , radioactive iodine commonly use irradiate residual thyroid tissue thyroid cancer follow surgical removal thyroid gland ( thyroidectomy ) . A whole body radioactive iodine scan usually carry thyroidectomy ass amount thyroid tissue leave behind surgery ( might still contain cancer ) , evaluate presence iodine avid lesion elsewhere body ( might cancer metastasis ) . A large dose radioactive iodine often give , still optimal iodine dose ablate thyroid remnant surgery know . In study , two radioactive iodine dos compare ablation thyroid remnant , small ( 1110 MBq ) dose large ( 3700 MBq ) dose . The study participant randomly allocate use 1:1 ratio receive either small large radioactive iodine dose . These treatment compare safety , adverse effect , need subsequent repeat treatment . The individual absorbed radiation dos measure . The study hypothesis few repeat radioiodine treatment might need large dose , large dose might associate high frequency adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Dose Radioactive Iodine Needed Ablate Thyroid Remnant Left Behind After Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study participant randomly allocate receive either 1110 MBq 3700 MBq dose radioiodine ( 131I ) approximately 5 week thyroidectomy . Thyroxin substitution initiate administration radioactive iodine . Treatment efficacy monitor use serum thyroglobulin measurement whole body radioiodine scan . The absorbed radiation dose thyroid remnant biological half-life radioactive iodine measure SPECT , 131I iodine detector Geiger counter . Treatment related adverse event collect use structure form 4 5 day , 2 week 3 month administration radioiodine . The need repeat treatment assess 4 6 month first administration radioiodine . The criterion repeat radioiodine treatment serum thyroglobulin &gt; 1 ug/L and/or presence abnormal radioiodine uptake whole body radioiodine scanning , carry follow 4-week interruption thyroxin supplementation follow administration rhTSH . Number patient : 160 Aims study : - To find weather risk second radioiodine treatment differs two dose level radioiodine : 1110 MBq 3700 MBq . - To study possible difference adverse effect treatment group . Also day hospital count . - To analyse effect absorb radiation dose treatment result</detailed_description>
