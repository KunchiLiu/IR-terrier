	<brief_summary>This study aim develop refine use intravascular wire image plaque aorta , iliac femoral artery use MRI . This project aim use increase resolution identify feature within plaque know associate increase risk plaque vessel occlusion . The hypothesis Intravascular MRI detect measure change response therapy time critical feature plaques peripheral artery patient atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient undergoing cardiac catheterization , 8French sheath introduce via femoral artery approach . This size sheath allow u visualize distal aorta perform intra vascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) . For patient , femoral venous sheath also position clinical purpose , access also utilized introduce MRI coil . This image approach allow u compare feasibility intravascular MRI imaging : ) artery ; b ) vein ; c ) combination . For patient schedule undergo clinically indicated cardiac catheterization , 6French sheath introduce via femoral artery approach . In patient , femoral venous sheath introduce arterial access upsized 8French sheath . Two tablespoon blood draw patient ass inflammatory marker C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) well confirm negative pregnancy test female patient childbearing age . Using 20cc non-ionic contrast , angiogram distal aorta ilio-femoral region perform record disc ( 5mins ) . Thereafter , approve guidewire intravascular ultrasound catheter position artery via access route , ultrasound image arterial segment record ( 10mins. ) . The guidewire ultrasound coil remove . Finally , intravascular MRI wire advance arterial access and/or previously indicate venous access X-ray control position desire atherosclerotic segment region distal aorta ilio-femoral area . The MRI wire ( ) secure place Tegaderm femoral sheath ( ) suture stable position . The patient transport MRI scanner , position scanner image record period exceed 60 minute . During transport throughout MRI scanning , patient monitor via MRI-compatible cardiac monitor . During time intravascular MRI coil within femoral sheath , continuously perfuse heparinized saline patient receive weight- adjust ( 12 U/kg ) intravenous heparin systemic anticoagulation prevent thrombosis . To obtain MRI image , patient receive gadolinium contrast per routine radiology protocol ( 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg ) . After record MRI image , MRI coil ( ) femoral sheath ( ) remove artery and/or vein per usual care .</detailed_description>
