	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy Plus Chemotherapy Early Stage Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy modality proven curative potential patient localise low grade lymphoma . Despite excellent control local tumour , patient relapse outside area treat radiation ultimately die lymphoma . This study test hypothesis addition six cycle chemotherapy plus rituximab ( systemic chemotherapy ) eradicate undetectable lymphoma deposit outside radiation field thereby improve cure rate . The study specifically test hypothesis six cycle adjuvant CVP chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisolone ) combination Rituximab improve progression-free survival patient stage I II low-grade follicular lymphoma treat involved-field radiotherapy ( IFRT ) . That , patient give radiotherapy plus systemic chemotherapy live long remain free disease longer patient treated radiation alone ? Radiotherapy alone widely regarded standard treatment disease . There number secondary endpoint study , follow : 1 . Comparison pre- post-treatment prevalence ( 14:18 ) translocation , peripheral blood bone marrow , patient treat either IFRT alone IFRT plus chemotherapy . This translocation potentially marker minimal residual disease eradication marker blood cell may prognostic implication . The clinical value `` molecular remission '' early predictor freedom progression ( FFP ) survival assess . 2 . Comparison overall survival FFP patient treat IFRT alone overall survival FFP patient treat combined IFRT systemic therapy . Delay progression disease may limit value overall survival . 3 . Comparison acute late toxicity second malignancy rate patient treat IFRT IFRT plus systemic therapy . 4 . Delineation location first relapse relation radiation therapy field .</detailed_description>
