	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether left ventricular function improve rapidly deferoxamine ( DFO ) deferiprone ( L1 ) combination therapy DFO monotherapy patient thalassemia decrease ejection fraction . Secondary aim include evaluate change myocardial iron burden use T2* estimate relative incidence severity chelator-induced toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : Participants randomize 1 year treatment L1/DFO combination therapy DFO monotherapy . At baseline , 6 month , 1 year therapy , cardiac function assess MRI measurement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , T2* , Holter monitoring , electrocardiography . Additional monitoring safety include weekly blood testing , monthly visit , periodic eye ear exam .</detailed_description>
