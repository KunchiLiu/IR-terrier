	<brief_summary>We aim compare pain management among three group ethnic disparity ( ED ) patient , Hispanics , non-Hispanic Blacks , non-Hispanic Whites , ass whether observed association pain management race/ethnicity independent potentially important confounding variable ( e.g. , age , sex , insurance status , education ) . We also aim assess whether effect race/ethnicity adequacy pain management explain patient ' initial pain intensity discordance patient physician 's : ) race/ethnicity ; b ) perception patient 's pain . To 285 patient long-bone fracture recruit EDs one municipal one voluntary hospital serve inner-city , disadvantage population Bronx . Data collect pain use self-reported pain non-verbal pain expression baseline , one hour post-baseline , discharge . Data analgesic administer , patient physician characteristic also collect . We plan conduct chart review long bone fracture 2000 2001 analyze association race/ethnicity pain management use design publish study . Comparison retrospective prospective study strengthen inference draw . We hypothesize Black Hispanic patient less likely receive opioid analgesic white patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct two urban academic Emergency Departments associate Montefiore Medical Center . Emergency Medicine resident full-time Emergency Medicine faculty present site . One sit municipal hospital Level 1 Trauma Center manage approximately 50,000 adult patient per year . The site primary academic medical center , manage approximately 80,000 adult patient per year , many require tertiary care . Both department serve urban population predominantly African-American Hispanic . Study Protocol Data obtain convenience sample patient September , 2003 November , 2006 . Patients eligible provider suspect isolated long-bone fracture long-bone film obtain . Because possible determine patient would positive film advance , patient suspect fracture meet inclusion criterion initially consider eligible enrol . Only confirm fracture include final study sample . Patients consider fracture radiology report attend radiologist specify isolated long-bone fracture define fracture humerus , radius , ulna , femur , tibia , fibula ( ICD-9 code : 812 , 813 , 821 , 823 , 824 ) . Data collection take place 8:00 midnight seven day week one institution 24 hour day , seven day week . Data collect standardize data collection instrument train fluently bilingual ( Spanish English ) Research Associates . The Research Associates attend three-day course research ethic , specific data collection procedure study . This follow two-week internship new Research Associates pair experienced Research Associates . Research Associates approach patient whose triage note indicate extremity injury , extremity pain , Research Associate observe physical indication extremity injury , provider identify patient potentially eligible study . Eligible patient ask sign inform consent . Data collect patient time physician 's examination patient ( baseline ) discharge . At discharge treat physician ask rate patient 's pain he/she first examine patient . If physician 's shift end patient discharged he/she ask rate patient 's initial pain leave ED . Measurements The name medication , dose , route , time administer obtain real time chart ED staff . Patients categorize receiving : 1 ) analgesic ; 2 ) NSAIDS acetaminophen ; 3 ) opioids . If NSAIDS acetaminophen opioids administer , patient categorize received opioids . Analgesics give solely fracture reduction use categorize patient . Opioid analgesic transform morphine equivalent follow : 1 mg morphine = 3 mg oxycodone ; 0.15 mg hydromorphone , 13 mg codeine . No opioid analgesic use exception fentanyl , use fracture reduction . The primary predictor variable self-reported race/ethnicity patient . This measured response question : `` Do consider : Hispanic/Latino , White/Caucasian , Black/African-American , multi-racial , ? '' Covariates : Patients ' pain provider assessment patient ' pain determinant treatment thus potential confounding relationship race/ethnicity treatment vary systematically race/ethnicity.10 Pain measure several way : Patients ask rate pain intensity validate reproducible 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) range 0 `` pain '' , 10 `` bad imaginable pain '' .18 They also ask describe pain categorically : `` pain '' , `` mild pain '' , `` moderate pain '' , `` severe pain '' . Change pain measure response question : `` How pain feel compare entered Emergency Room ? '' It also measure difference patient 's rating pain entry pain discharge . At time discharge treat physician ask recall rate patient 's initial pain use verbal descriptor use patient We reason ask doctor rate patient ' pain make treatment decision might bias treatment . Other clinically plausible confounders relationship pain management race/ethnicity include : sex , age , educational level ( high school , high school General Equivalency Diploma ( GED ) , college , Bachelor 's degree high ) , insurance status ( self-pay , health maintenance organization ( HMO ) private insurance , Medicaid , insurance ) , accompany ED someone might act patient advocate , mechanism injury ( fall , sport , motor vehicle , ) , fracture reduction ED , arrival ambulance . Data Analysis : Patient characteristic report mean standard deviation , median interquartile range ( IQR ) percentages . We use chi-square test compare discrete patient characteristic race/ethnicity . One-way analysis variance use compare continuous characteristic Kruskal-Wallis test compare medians non-normally distributed variable . Logistic model use test presence independent ( adjust ) association race/ethnicity treatment pain . We use force entry model initial patient rating pain intensity , provider rating patient 's pain baseline , hospital , sex , age , education , insurance status , whether accompany ED , mechanism injury , fracture reduction ED , arrival ambulance . Hosmer Lemeshow 's test use assess model fit . We use Zhang Kai 's method estimate relative risk odds ratio . Sample size calculation : There consensus constitute clinically significant difference treatment racial ethnic group . In absence consensus base estimate effect size previous findings.11 , 12 We use estimate 75 % , 50 % 60 % respectively proportion white , African-American , Hispanics treat analgesic , two-tailed significance level 0.05 , power 80 % calculate sample size least 70 patient long-bone fracture three group . Two individual independently enter data Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Data Entry ( Chicago , IL ) . Transcription error reconcile referral original hardcopy data collection instrument . We use NQuery 6.0 ( Saugus , MA ) sample size calculation , SPSS version 15.0 ( Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
