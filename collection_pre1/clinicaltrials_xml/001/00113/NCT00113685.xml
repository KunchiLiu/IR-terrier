	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinical outcome patient follow blunt traumatic injury hypovolemic shock , receive either lactate ringer 's solution hypertonic saline dextran ( HSD ) resuscitation ; also , focus specifically neurologic outcome patient brain injury effect HSD resuscitation inflammatory cell responsiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypertonic Saline With Dextran Treating Hypovolemic Shock Severe Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Trauma lead cause death among Americans age 1 35 year . The majority death result hypovolemic shock , type shock heart unable supply enough blood body , result severe brain injury . Patients hypovolemic shock develop state systemic tissue ischemia subsequent reperfusion injury time fluid resuscitation . Conventional resuscitation patient involve intravenous administration large volume isotonic slightly hypotonic ( lactated ringer ) solution begin pre-hospital environment . Previous study suggest alternative resuscitation fluid , HSD , may reduce mortality patient ; study conclusive . Furthermore , HSD may specific advantage brain-injured patient , may aid rapid restoration cerebral perfusion , prevent extravascular fluid sequestration , thus , limit secondary brain injury . In addition , recent study demonstrate hypertonicity significantly alter activation inflammatory cell , may result reduction subsequent organ injury follow whole body ischemia/reperfusion ultimately decrease nosocomial infection rate . Blunt trauma victim low blood pressure identify pre-hospital provider ( paramedic flight nurse ) randomize receive either 250 cc HSD 250 cc isotonic solution ( lactate ringer 's solution ) . Lactated ringer 's solution current standard care ambulances helicopter supply . All bag study solution prepare Harborview Medical Center pharmacy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomized clinical trial seek evaluate clinical outcome inflammatory cell function patient shock follow blunt traumatic injury randomize receive either 7.5 % hypertonic saline/6 % dextran ( HSD ) follow lactated ringer 's solution lactate ringer 's solution alone . It hypothesize HSD resuscitation inhibit initial excessive systemic activation inflammatory response , translate reduction incidence organ dysfunction typically induced response . Furthermore , study evaluate impact HSD resuscitation recovery follow traumatic brain injury , previous study suggest subgroup great survival advantage HSD intervention . The specific aim study include follow : Aim 1 : To determine impact pre-hospital administration HSD development organ failure follow blunt traumatic injury hypovolemic shock . Aim 2 : To determine impact pre-hospital administration HSD neurologic outcome follow brain injury patient hypovolemic shock . Aim 3a : To determine effect pre-hospital administration HSD activation circulate neutrophils monocyte . Aim 3b : To determine effect pre-hospital administration HSD activation T lymphocytes . The study build upon previous research demonstrate safety practicality resuscitation strategy pre-hospital environment . A detailed understanding immuno-inflammatory effect hypertonicity patient long-term neurologic outcome patient brain injury critical determine role resuscitation approach critically injured patient .</detailed_description>
