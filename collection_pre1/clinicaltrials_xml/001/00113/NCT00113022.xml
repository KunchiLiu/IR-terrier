	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness experimental drug , Org 24448 , short-term treatment depression . It examine effect drug symptom , low mood persistent sadness , poor sleep appetite , poor motivation lack enjoyment thing people normally enjoy , negative thinking , feel slow trouble concentrating . It also assess whether drug improves cognitive function , especially memory . Patient major depression serious , unstable medical illness 21 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen psychiatric medical history , diagnostic interview , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test , woman , pregnancy test . Participants taper anti-depression drug ( medication allow study ) 3-week period begin 2-week drug-free period . During 2 week electroencephalogram ( EEG ) light stimulation , whose EEG indicate seizure disorder exclude study . Also begin drug-free period begin take placebo ( `` sugar pill '' ) twice day . After 2 week placebo , patient begin treatment Org 24448 , others remain placebo . They continue medication 8 week , time weekly check vital sign , blood urine test , rating scale depression anxiety . Level function evaluate twice study . After 8 week treatment , patient physical exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , EEG , blood test , begin come study drug , taper medication week . In addition procedure , patient undergo follow test 2-week drug-free period toward end 8-week medication phase : - Neuropsychological testing , include measurement cognitive ability memory , attention , problem-solving , language skill . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) : This nuclear medicine test provide information different brain region . The patient lie table PET scanner ( similar compute tomography ( CT ) scanner ) , mask place face help keep head still . A sugar fluid radioactive material attach injected catheter ( plastic tube ) insert vein patient 's arm . The scanner detects ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression devastate illness estimate affect 12 % 17 % population point lifetime individual . Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant ( e.g. , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) ) treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Thus clear need develop novel improve therapeutic major depression . Current pathophysiological theory regard neurobiology depression include alteration intracellular signal cascade , impairment cellular plasticity resilience . There recent evidence suggest promote growth factor brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) may provide mechanism treatment depression . New information indicate modulation glutamate receptor action antidepressant treatment suggest novel approach develop new class antidepressant . Studies show biarylpropylsulfonamide AMPA ( 2-amino-3- ( 5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl ) propanoic acid ) receptor potentiators ( LY392098 LY451616 ) antidepressant effect animal model depression . Several study demonstrate AMPA receptor activation increase expression BDNF vitro vivo . Thus , one possible new approach treatment depression use AMPA receptor potentiator . In study propose compare ampakine receptor potentiator Org 24448 placebo treatment Major Depression . Inpatients outpatient ( primarily outpatient ) , age 21 70 , diagnosis Major Depression ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment either Org 24448 placebo period 8 week . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Approximately 90 patient acute major depression enrol study order reach goal randomize 70 patient control trial .</detailed_description>
