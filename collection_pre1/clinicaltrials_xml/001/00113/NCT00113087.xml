	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety administer angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-I ) ( enalapril ) infants functional single ventricle . The study also compare effect ACE-I therapy placebo somatic growth compare effect ACE-I therapy placebo sign symptom heart failure , neurodevelopmental functional status , ventricular geometry , function , atrioventricular ( AV ) valve regurgitation . In addition , study determine relationship genetic polymorphism link ventricular hypertrophy ( enlarged heart ) response ACE-I therapy compare incidence adverse event subject treat ACE-I subject treat placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Growth impairment common infant child congenital heart disease , often presence congestive heart failure and/or cyanosis . Growth failure note many infant single ventricle manifest cyanosis heart failure commonly persist palliative surgery . Whether impairment related persistent progressive abnormality cardiac structure function know . ACE-Is widely use treatment infant severe congestive heart failure improve cardiac function somatic growth . The ability ACE-I improve somatic growth infant single ventricle previously study .

After stratification ventricular anatomy , neonates randomly assign receive enalapril placebo follow 14 month .</detailed_description>
