	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : During infancy , environmental factor may affect immune system development lead development asthma . The hygiene hypothesis suggest absence endotoxin exposure lead unfavorable Th1/Th2 balance . Thus , control antigen exposure infancy may establish Th1/Th2 balance block onset asthma slow progression disease . Lactobacillus bacterium commonly find many food ( e.g. , yogurt ) typical childhood diet . It also use probiotic supplement prevent development diarrhea . Due safety availability , Lactobacillus ideal bacterium use antigen exposure test hygiene hypothesis . Consistent hygiene hypothesis , observational study suggest early Lactobacillus exposure lead decrease risk develop atopic dermatitis , associate asthma later year . The investigator aware study examine effect Lactobacillus development early marker asthma child risk develop disease . They hypothesize Lactobacillus use antigen exposure establish Th1/Th2 balance block development early marker asthma . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The hygiene hypothesis suggest absence endotoxin exposure lead unfavorable Th1/Th2 balance . A controlled antigen exposure infancy may help establish Th1/ Th2 balance block onset progression asthma . Lactobacillus bacterium find many food typical pediatric diet , use supplement prevent diarrhea . Due safety , feasibility , early promising result prevent atopic dermatitis , Lactobacillus ideal bacterium use exposure test hygiene hypothesis . The investigator hypothesize exposure may block delay development early marker asthma . The study use randomize placebo-controlled trial design measure effect 6-month daily exposure Lactobacillus , infant supplement , immune system asthma development first 3 year life . The study measure effect antigen exposure presence time presentation : ( 1 ) early clinical marker asthma development ( frequent wheezing , wheeze without cold , rhinitis , atopic dermatitis ) ; ( 2 ) early immunologic marker asthma development ( eosinophilia , immunoglobulin E ) ; ( 3 ) development T-helper phenotype ( Th-1 v Th-2 ) . Investigators characterize Th phenotype measure whole blood lymphocyte response stimulant , focus Th1 ( IFN-gamma , interleukin ( IL ) -12 ) Th2 cytokine ( IL-10 , IL-4 , IL-13 ) , well real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) PCR amplification ( TaqMan ) quantify RNA transcript . Clinical immunologic marker measure 3 year age . Adherence assess use diary , pill count , Lactobacillus stool culture . The study use intention-to-treat analysis control impact family , environmental , diet , demographic factor outcomes use multivariate regression survival analysis technique . Investigators expect compare control , subject receive Lactobacillus decrease delay development marker asthma , great likelihood develop Th1 phenotype .</detailed_description>
