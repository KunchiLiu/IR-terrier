	<brief_title>Low-Dose Decitabine Myelodysplastic Syndrome Post Azacytidine Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylation change occur Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) affect gene usage human cell . Abnormal methylation common leukemia , related disease MDS . Decitabine new drug block DNA methylation . Researchers want find blocking methylation help control MDS . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You physical exam , routine blood test ( 4-6 tablespoon ) , bone marrow aspirate . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive decitabine vein one hour , day , 5 day ( 1 course ) . If possible due complication , receive drug injection skin twice day 5 day ( 1 course ) . Treatment give every 4 8 week depend well blood count recover . After complete 8-12 week therapy , response evaluate . If response treatment good , treatment decitabine continue . Decitabine treatment may continue 12 course , long judged best control leukemia . During study , need visit doctor periodically physical exam measurement vital sign . The frequency doctor visit vary depend physical condition , require least month . Blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) do every week first 6-8 week treatment , every 1 2 week length study . The blood sample use routine lab test . Every 1-3 course , bone marrow sample also take check cell related disease , ( every 1-3 course ) , completion study . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Decitabine yet Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve . It provide free charge MGI Pharma . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
