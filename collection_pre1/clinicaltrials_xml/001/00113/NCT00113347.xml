	<brief_title>Erlotinib Docetaxel With Concomitant Boost Radiation Therapy ( XRT ) Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSI-774 ( also know Erlotinib Tarceva ) drug help block activity enzyme believe play important role cell growth . It hop block enzyme slow tumor growth . Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) commonly use chemotherapy drug . Docetaxel design target destroy cancer cell . Before begin treatment , complete physical exam . You also routine blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine test , chest x-ray CT scan , electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You dental exam perform dentist . Women able child must negative pregnancy test ( blood urine ) . You also either CT scan MRI measure disease . You may bone scan and/or CT scan abdomen chest doctor think necessary care . You swallow evaluation . The swallow evaluation involve drink barium liquid vary thickness fluoroscopy ( like x-ray movie ) do evaluate swallow function . You also complete questionnaire asks question quality life issue . The questionnaire take 10 minute complete . In study receive radiation therapy 5 day per week ( Monday Friday ) 6 week . You receive radiation therapy weekend . For first 3 week treatment receive radiation day . Starting 4th week treatment , receive radiation treatment twice day . The treatment least 6 hour apart . You receive twice daily radiation treatment Monday Friday 3 week . On first day radiation treatment also receive first dose docetaxel . You receive docetaxel vein 15 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 treatment . Beginning Day 2 treatment , begin take OSI-774 mouth . You take OSI-774 day morning 7 ounce water either 2 hour 1 hour eating . If unable swallow OSI-774 , may dissolve distilled water take feeding tube . You take OSI-774 every day treatment except day receive docetaxel ( i.e. , Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . You take OSI-774 day receive docetaxel infusion . Participants enter study group 3 . The dos OSI-774 docetaxel increase group . Six patient study dose level estimate high safe dose . While receive treatment study , examine least week . You also weekly blood test ( 2-4 teaspoon ) . At end treatment , another CT scan MRI measure disease . You also complete physical exam blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) . You may take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After complete treatment , follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month Year 3 , every 6 month Years 4 5 . These visit include medical history physical exam . A CT MRI study blood work ( 2-4 teaspoon ) may also do . You swallow evaluation 3 12 month follow treatment , yearly year 5 . When swallow evaluation , also ask complete short questionnaire swallowing . The questionnaire take 10 minute complete . This investigational study . OSI-774 approve FDA treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Docetaxel approve FDA treatment lung cancer breast cancer . Their use together study radiation treatment experimental . Up 24 patient expect take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
