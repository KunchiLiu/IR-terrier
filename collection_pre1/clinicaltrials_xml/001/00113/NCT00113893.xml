	<brief_title>SCIO-469 : Open-Label Study Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCIO-469 belongs new class treatment inhibits p38 MAP kinase . p38 MAPK activation control production TNF-a , VEGF , IL-1b . As inhibitor p38 MAPK , SCIO-469 block synthesis molecule , well TNF-a activity . This randomized , open-label , modify dose-ascension study design assess safety , tolerability , efficacy oral SCIO-469 treatment patient MDS . This patient group select inhibitory effect SCIO-469 expression activity cytokine play role progression MDS . The treatment arm 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 mg tid 15 subject per arm ( total 60 subject ) arm may expand 25 subject per arm ( maximum total 100 subject ) . Initially , subject randomly assign one low two treatment arm ( 30 mg tid 60 mg tid ) . When 6 subject per arm ( least 12 subject total ) receive study drug least 4 week , predefined criterion use determine whether open randomization third arm ( i.e. , 90 mg tid ) . The criterion base number subject suspend study drug due drug-related toxicity . The 120-mg tid arm open enrollment 15 subject enrol first three treatment arm ; decision open enrollment similar criterion use open third arm . Subjects evaluate least monthly safety efficacy measurement ( AE reporting , safety lab vitals ) . Subjects receive study drug 16 week . Subjects demonstrate hematologic improvement ( erythroid , platelet , neutrophil response IWG criterion ) week 16 eligible continue treatment dose study drug 36 additional week ( 52 week total drug exposure ) . Subjects meet IWG criterion hematologic improvement week 16 , judgment investigator , experience clinical benefit may also receive 36 additional week treatment . The judgment treatment extension additional 26 week respond subject make 52 week 78 week ; maximum total drug exposure 104 week . All subject follow 4 week last study drug treatment safety assessment resolution Grade 3 great treatment-related toxicity define NCI CTCAE ( v. 3.0 ) . Oral SCIO-469 give 16 week patient MDS . Subjects receive total daily dose SCIO-469 90 mg , 180 mg , 270 mg , 360 mg . The treatment arm 30-mg tablet tid , 60-mg tablet tid , 90-mg tablet tid , 120 mg ( i.e. , two 60-mg tablet ) tid 15 subject per arm ( total 60 subject ) . Responding subject may dose 104 week total drug exposure .</detailed_description>
