	<detailed_description>Tree MATA MPL develop provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy patient prove type I hypersensitivity tree ( birch , alder , hazel ) pollen . The tree pollen extract modify glutaraldehyde produce active ingredient , allergoid . This modification reduce reactivity extract IgE antibody , thus reduce risk side effect . However , simultaneous reduction important immunological property , IgG T cell reactivity , see . MPL ( Monophosphoryl Lipid A ) , purify , detoxify glycolipid derive cell wall Salmonella minnesota , include product formulation adjuvant increase immunogenic effect product enhance switch allergen-specific TH2 TH1-like T cell profile . The purpose study ass specific immunological change ( IgG , IgG1 , IgG4 IgE ) allergic subject follow 2 subcutaneous injection different dos study medication ( Tree MATA ) placebo administer 3 week apart . The immunological change use assess performance R7 IgG reactivity assay range clinically efficacious dos .</detailed_description>
