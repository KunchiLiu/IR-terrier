	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Clinical Trial Evaluate Efficacy Bevacizumab Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab drug bind inhibits VEGF , blood-vessel stimulating agent unusually high level kidney cancer . This drug may decrease growth kidney cancer . Every two week study cycle , receive dose bevacizumab intravenously ( needle vein ) . The first bevacizumab dose give 90 minute continuous IV infusion . If first dose tolerate without side effect relate intravenous ( IV ) infusion , second dose may deliver 60 minute . If 60 minute infusion tolerate , dos bevacizumab may give 30 minute . If experience infusion-related side effect 60 minute infusion , dose give 90 minute . If experience infusion-related side effect 30 minute infusion , dose give 60 minute . Other drug , include Tylenol Benadryl , may give , , therapy help prevent ease side effect . These drug may give either mouth IV line . During treatment , blood sample ( 1 1/2 tablespoon ) take per 2 week cycle . Urine sample take begin cycle . At around 56 day treatment , tumor measure use X-rays scan . Treatment stop 56 day therapy . In first phase , receive 4 dos bevacizumab . If cancer stable shrink bevacizumab first 56 day , tolerate treatment well , undergo surgery remove kidney tumor . Surgery schedule least 4 week last dose bevacizumab . Approximately 4 week surgery , undergo repeat CT scan . If cancer stable continue shrink , restart treatment bevacizumab . You continue tumor measurement scan around every 56 day ( 8 week ) receive bevacizumab , initial scan show evidence tumor presence . However , If tumor grow substantially operative period , i.e . first set scan around day 56 scan perform surgery , take study , treatment offer . If cancer grow bevacizumab first 56 day , undergo surgery remove kidney tumor . Surgery schedule least 4 week last dose Bevacizumab . After surgery , continue bevacizumab . Once recover surgery , doctor may recommend different drug therapy treat cancer . In circumstance , first 56 day therapy bevacizumab , doctor may decide possible helpful kidney remove progression cancer render operation either feasible inappropriate care . In case , doctor may recommend different drug therapy cancer , continue bevacizumab . You may take study disease progress intolerable side effect occur . If take study , repeat scan , physical examination , blood testing ( 2 tablespoon ) , urine testing , ECG . If elevate blood pressure excess protein urine , ask come back every 2 month repeat blood pressure test urine testing level fall normal range , one year . This investigational study . Avastin commercially available approved FDA metastatic colorectal cancer small cell lung cancer . The drug experimental authorize research purpose renal cell carcinoma . Up 50 participant take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
