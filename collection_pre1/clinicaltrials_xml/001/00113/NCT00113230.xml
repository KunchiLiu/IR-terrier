	<brief_summary>Preoperative chemoradiation lead increase pelvic control overall survival , distant local disease control remain problematic locally advanced rectal cancer patient . Enhancing effect chemotherapy radiotherapy increase tumor response well distant disease control . Patients complete response therapy increase sphincter preservation , possibly limit surgery ( full thickness local excision ) . When combined standard chemotherapy , bevacizumab [ RHUMAB VEGF , Avastin ] show improve response median survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer recent randomize trial , lead increase activity preclinical study radiotherapy , find well tolerated chemoradiation phase I trial conduct M.D . Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . The hypothesis addition bevacizumab standard chemoradiation safely lead increase tumor response patient locally advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation With RHUMAB VEGF ( Avastin ) Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Avastin [ RHUMAB VEGF , Bevacizumab ] drug damage effect blood vessel growth tumor . Before treatment start , complete physical exam . About 2 tablespoon blood drawn routine test urine test perform . Chest x-rays CT scan abdomen pelvis do . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . You receive radiation therapy day 5 day row ( Monday-Friday ) 5 week three day ( total 28 treatment ) . You take chemotherapy drug capecitabine mouth twice day day receive radiation therapy . These pill take Saturday Sunday . You must take cimetidine , must coumadin least one week sorivudine brivudine least four week start capecitabine take capecitabine . You receive drug Avastin vein every 2 week six week ( total three dos ) . The infusion first last 90 minute . If allergic reaction , fever chill , shorten 60 minute 30 minute later infusion . During study , physical exam , include weekly blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) . The possible development side effect closely monitor . All participant surgical removal rectal tumor 6-8 week completion treatment would standard care disease . No patient surgery 6 week . After participation study , follow-up evaluation need standard care . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Capecitabine approve FDA , Avastin yet evaluate approval . About 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
