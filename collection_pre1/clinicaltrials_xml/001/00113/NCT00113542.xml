	<brief_summary>Psoriasis common skin disease affect estimate 2.6 % US population . It chronic , recurrent condition cure , way control . Psoriasis characterize epidermal hyperplasia ( abnormal increase number normal cell outer layer skin ) . Tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) , copper chelator ( drug remove copper bloodstream ) first create treat Wilson 's disease , disorder cause much copper blood . Studies animal since show TM may also prevent formation new blood vessel may also block key component inflammation ( swell , redness , pain ) cause psoriasis . TM approve FDA use yet . It investigational drug use clinical research . We propose test whether new treatment TM fact improve stabilize psoriasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Tetrathiomolybdate Treatment Psoriasis Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Tetrathiomolybdate psoriasis therapy . Psoriasis common skin disease affect estimate 2.6 % US population . It chronic , recurrent condition cure way control . Psoriasis characterize epidermal hyperplasia , increase dermal angiogenesis , infiltration activate lymphocyte . Beginning observation cyclosporin A , whose primary action inhibit lymphokine release proliferation T cell , effective treatment psoriasis , last two decade saw major paradigm shift pathogenesis psoriasis , view psoriasis disease epidermal origin view epidermal response immunological injury . In fully activate T cell psoriatic skin , T1/T2 cytokine balance shift favor T1 expression , production IL-2 IFN-γ . Activated T1 lymphocytes also produce TNF-α . This pivotal cytokine regulate array proinflammatory mediator . Recently , anti-TNF-α therapy use chimeric anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody ( infliximab ) TNF-receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein ( etanercept ) show highly effective patient severe psoriasis . Efforts treat psoriasis inhibit neovascularization psoriatic plaque also show effective . A randomized phase I/II clinical trial use Neovastat , naturally occur inhibitor angiogenesis , result dose-dependent improvement Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) score , thus provide evidence alter angiogenesis integral part psoriasis pathophysiology . Since TM proven antiangiogenic anti-TNF-α activity , encourage TM therapy beneficial psoriasis .</detailed_description>
