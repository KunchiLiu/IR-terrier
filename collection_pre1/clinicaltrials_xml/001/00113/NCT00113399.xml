	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cisplatin paclitaxel may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy effective give combination chemotherapy alone treat head neck cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy combination chemotherapy see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient recurrent head neck cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Head Neck Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient previously irradiate unresectable locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat radiotherapy , cisplatin , paclitaxel v cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone . Secondary - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life , functional/performance status , quality-adjusted survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 30 minute daily day 1-5 , 15-19 , 29-33 , 43-47 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily day 6-13 , 20-27 , 34-41 , 48-55 . - Arm II : Patients receive 1 follow cisplatin-based* regimen discretion treat physician : - Regimen 1 : Patients receive cisplatin* IV 1-2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 96 hour day 1-4 . - Regimen 2 : Patients receive cisplatin* IV 1-2 hour paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . - Regimen 3 : Patients receive cisplatin* IV 1-2 hour docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . NOTE : *Carboplatin may substitute cisplatin patient creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min patient experience grade 2 3 neurotoxicity . For regimen , treatment repeat every 21 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond documentation CR . Quality life assess baseline 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 240 patient ( 120 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 5½ year .</detailed_description>
