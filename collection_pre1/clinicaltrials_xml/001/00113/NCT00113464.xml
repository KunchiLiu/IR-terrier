	<brief_summary>This study explore screening immunodeficiency disease ( disease cause problem fight infection ) . There method present screen baby birth immunodeficiency . However , baby low number T-cells-an important type immune system cell-may find study T-cell product call TRECs ( T-cell receptor excision circle ) . This study : - Collect sample child several different immunodeficiency find disorder find screen dry blood spot TRECs . - Try develop screen test base kind material derive dried blood spot . Children primary immunodeficiency low number T cell bone marrow transplant may eligible study . Participating child donate 5 ml ( 1 teaspoon ) blood . The sample may collect child blood test . The liquid blood analyze determine number T cell , rest blood use make dried blood spot filter paper . The blood spot use develop screen test immunodeficiency . The blood spot data child 's age , diagnosis , current medicine keep coded diagnosis code number instead child 's name .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objective : T cell receptor excision circle ( TRECs ) episomal DNA circle excise T cell receptor gene T cell maturation thymus . They replicate , dilute T cell proliferate . Our objective examine level TRECs blood sample patient primary immunodeficiency ( PI ) diseases ; determine PI disease might detect test newborn dry blood spot low number TRECs ; use blood spot collect future confirmatory alternative test develop newborn screening PIs . Population : Patients diagnose defined primary T cell immunodeficiency disease undefined condition low T cell number . There several known , additional unknown , gene defect impair T lymphocyte maturation function . The frequency rare disorder unknown , could potentially learned course population-based newborn screening . Design : We contact network immunology colleague help u identify enroll patient already diagnose PI disorder . These patient HIV rule part immune evaluation . We provide mail-in kit receive blood sample analysis . We attempt retrieve actual Guthrie card contain dry blood spot patient state screening laboratory determine number TRECs present birth infant condition . Outcome Measures : We measure TRECs dry blood spot , correlate TREC number diagnosis clinical laboratory data . We hope determine range immunodeficiency disease demonstrate significantly reduce TRECs compare healthy subject use assay . Because TREC test may insufficiently sensitive specific stand-alone test , test may develop perform sample future , include DNA re-sequencing , detection mRNA T cell specific gene and/or protein express T cell .</detailed_description>
