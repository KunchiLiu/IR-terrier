	<brief_title>Effect Exercise Elevated C-reactive Protein Concentrations Formerly Inactive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : CRP , marker systemic inflammation , report independent predictor cardiovascular disease woman men . Recently publish data cross-sectional analysis show CRP inversely related cardiorespiratory fitness , association independent body mass index . Regular exercise may affect CRP level , possibly use mean reduce elevate CRP level . Though number study focus related topic , publish report randomize clinical trial effect exercise training alone CRP level . DESIGN NARRATIVE : An estimated 200 individual randomly assign either exercise control group exercise group . Exercising individual participate 3 4 training session week 4 month , progress total energy expenditure 16 kcal [ kg ( -1 ) , week ( -1 ) ] , exercise dose upper end current public health recommendation physical activity . The target exercise intensity 50-70 % baseline volume oxygen consume ( V02 max ) . VO2 max maximal rate oxygen consumption exercise , measurement fitness . The primary outcome measure plasma CRP concentration . Secondary outcome change variables potential mechanism regular exercise might reduce CRP . These variable include visceral adiposity , cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , heart rate variability measure autonomic balance . Although primary outcome CRP level , study also contribute significantly limit body literature examine effect exercise variables visceral adiposity , cytokine , heart rate variability .</detailed_description>
