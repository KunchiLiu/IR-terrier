	<brief_title>Safety Study Using Stem Cells Stimulate Development New Blood Vessels Peripheral Vascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently effective medical therapy enhance blood flow legs patient peripheral vascular disease . For patient limb threaten ischemia option relief rest pain gangrene amputation . There evidence animal clinical study adult stem cell bone marrow , call endothelial progenitor cell , participate development new blood vessel , process call angiogenesis . In investigation , patient limb threaten ischemia bone marrow harvest stem cell remove inject directly muscle diseased leg . The procedure require 4 hour subject admit Indiana University Medical Center overnight . The follow-up period 12 week analysis consist examination 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 week . Adverse serious adverse event record time period . Diagnostic study obtain measure blood flow treat leg follow period include transcutaneous ( skin ) oxygen measurement , pressure recording leg , arteriography , magnetic resonance imaging , wound healing .</detailed_description>
