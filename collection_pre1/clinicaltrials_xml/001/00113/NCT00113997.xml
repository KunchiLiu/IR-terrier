	<detailed_description>Given central role thrombosis pathobiology acute ischemic heart disease , injectable ( intravenous subcutaneous ) anticoagulants become foundation medical treatment patient present acute coronary syndrome ( unstable angina myocardial infarction ; ACS ) undergo coronary revascularization procedure , either percutaneously surgically ( Harrington et al. , 2004 ; Popma et al. , 2004 ) . Currently available anticoagulant include unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , direct thrombin inhibitor ( DTI ) ( e.g. , recombinant hirudin , bivalirudin , argatroban ) . The present paradigm anticoagulant use continue antithrombotic drug development establish balance efficacy ( reduce risk ischemic event ) safety ( minimize risk bleeding ) ( Harrington et al. , 2004 ) . Each available agent carry increase risk bleed relative placebo . The major adverse event associate anticoagulant antithrombotic drug bleed , cause permanent disability death ( Ebbesen et al. , 2001 ; Levine et al. , 2004 ) . Generally , cardiovascular clinician willing trade increase risk bleed drug reduce ischemic complication either acute coronary syndrome coronary revascularization procedure . However , recent data suggest bleed event , particularly require blood transfusion , significant impact outcome cost treatment patient ACS . Transfusion rate patient undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery range 30-60 % , transfusion patient associate increased short , medium long-term mortality ( Bracey et al. , 1999 ; Engoren et al. , 2002 ; Hebert et al. , 1999 ) . Bleeding also frequent costly complication associate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , transfusion perform 5-10 % patient incremental cost $ 8000- $ 12,000 ( Moscucci , 2002 ) . In addition , frequency significant bleeding patient undergoing treatment ACS high well , range 5 % 10 % ( exclude patient undergo CABG ) , bleed transfusion independently associate significant increase short-term mortality ( Moscucci et al. , 2003 ; Rao et al. , 2004 ) . Therefore , despite continue development novel antithrombotics , significant clinical need exist safer anticoagulant agent . For hospitalized patient acute ischemic heart disease , ideal anticoagulant would deliverable intravenous subcutaneous injection , immediately effective , easily dose require frequent monitoring immediately predictably reversible . UFH antidote-reversible anticoagulant currently approve use . However , UFH significant limitation . First , heparin complex pharmacokinetics make predictability use challenging ( Granger et al. , 1996 ) . Second , dose predictability antidote , protamine , challenge , serious side effect associate use ( Carr Silverman , 1999 ; Welsby et al. , 2005 ) . Finally , heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) thrombocytopenia thrombosis ( HITT ) ( Warkentin , 2005 ; Warkentin Greinacher , 2004 ) . Despite limitation , heparin remain commonly use anticoagulant hospitalized patient primarily `` reversible . '' Newer-generation anticoagulant , LMWHs improve upon predictability UFH dose require lab-based monitoring part routine use . HIT HITT observe less frequently LMWHs , relative UFH , eliminate risk . Two three commercially available DTIs , lepirudin argatroban , specifically approve use patient develop history HIT . Bivalirudin approve use anticoagulant PCI therefore provide attractive alternative UFH patient HIT . However , direct clear antidotes reverse anticoagulant effect LMWHs , DTIs , present particular risk use patient undergoing surgical percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure ( Jones et al. , 2002 ) . Bleeding patient treat LMWH 's DTI 's manage administer blood product ( include clot factor ) . Rapid reversal drug activity achieve formulation drug infusible agent short half-life , via administration second agent , antidote , neutralize activity drug . Short-acting direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin , reverse simply cessation infusion , develop infusible anticoagulant use CABG surgery ( Merry et al. , 2004 ) . However , co-morbidities renal dysfunction , present large percentage patient undergo CABG ( PCI ) procedure ( Al Suwaidi et al. , 2002 ) , may preclude rapid clearance drug thus delay reversal activity , and/or relatively large quantity drug require sustain anticoagulation ( i.e. , necessary achieve effective steady state level short-half-life agent ) may significantly interact underlie renal impairment compound problem . Therefore , remain see drug indeed achieve rapid reversal anticoagulation follow stoppage infusion target patient population , whether clearance drug may exacerbate renal dysfunction . An alternative approach provide control anticoagulation embrace Regado Biosciences utilization anticoagulating agent medium-term duration action ( ~12 hour ) achieve clinically appropriate activity relatively low dos , combination second agent capable specifically bind neutralize primary anticoagulant . Such `` drug-antidote '' combination ensure predictable safe neutralization reversal anticoagulant activity drug ( Rusconi et al. , 2004 ; Rusconi et al. , 2002 ) . The cell-based model coagulation ( Hoffman et al. , 1995 ; Kjalke et al. , 1998 ; Monroe et al. , 1996 ) ( Figure 1 ) provide clear explanation date physiologic coagulation occur vivo . The advance model prior description coagulation reaction incorporate cellular surface upon specific coagulation factor accumulate react , thereby accurately explain phenotype observed individual lack , deficient , various coagulation factor platelet receptor . According model , procoagulant reaction occur three distinct step , initiation , amplification propagation . Initiation coagulation take place tissue factor-bearing cell ( e.g. , activate monocyte , macrophage , endothelial cell ) . Coagulation factor VIIa , form complex tissue factor , catalyze activation coagulation factor IX ( FIX ) X ( FX ) , turn generates small amount thrombin prothrombin . In amplification phase ( also refer prim phase ) , small amount thrombin generate initiation phase activate coagulation factor V , VIII , XI also activate platelet , supply surface upon procoagulant reaction occur . In vivo , small amount thrombin generate amplification phase sufficient convert fibrinogen fibrin , due presence endogenous thrombin inhibitor term serpins , anti-thrombin III , -2-macroglobulin heparin cofactor II . The final phase procoagulant reaction , propagation , occur exclusively surface activate platelet . During propagation , significant amount FIXa generate FXIa-catalyzed activation FIX . FIXa form complex requisite cofactor FVIIIa , activate FX . Subsequently , FXa form complex requisite cofactor FVa . The FXa-FVa complex activates prothrombin , lead `` burst '' thrombin generation fibrin deposition . The end result formation stable clot . Based upon model , FIXa play two role coagulation . In initiation phase , FIXa play important role generate small amount thrombin via activation FX FXa subsequent prothrombin activation . However , role FIXa least partially redundant tissue factor FVIIa-catalyzed conversion FX FXa . The critical role FIXa occur propagation phase , FVIIIa/FIXa enzyme complex serf sole catalyst FXa generation activate platelet surface . Therefore , reduction FIXa activity , either due genetic deficiency FIX ( i.e . hemophilia B ) pharmacologic inhibition FIX/IXa , expect several effect coagulation . First , inhibition loss FIXa activity partially dampen initiation coagulation . Second , inhibition loss FIXa activity profound effect propagation phase coagulation , result significant reduction elimination thrombin production . Finally , limitation thrombin generation propagation phase least partially quell feedback amplification coagulation reduce activation platelet upstream coagulation factor factor V , VIII XI . Inhibitors FIX activity , active site-inactivated factor IXa ( FIXai ) monoclonal antibody FIX ( e.g. , antibody BC2 ) , exhibit potent anticoagulant antithrombotic activity multiple animal model , include various animal model arterial thrombosis stroke ( Benedict et al. , 1991 ; Choudhri et al. , 1999 ; Feuerstein et al. , 1999 ; Spanier et al. , 1998a ; Spanier et al. , 1997 ; Spanier et al. , 1998b ; Toomey et al. , 2000 ) . In general , study show FIXa inhibitor higher ratio antithrombotic activity bleed risk unfractionated heparin animal . However , study , dos marginally higher effective dose , animal treat agent exhibit bleed profile different heparin . Such experience well-controlled animal study suggest , clinical setting , ability control activity FIXa inhibitor would enhance safety facilitate medical use . In addition , FIXai show safe effective heparin replacement multiple animal surgical model require anticoagulant therapy , include rabbit model synthetic patch vascular repair , well canine non-human primate model CABG cardiopulmonary bypass ( Spanier et al. , 1998a ; Spanier et al. , 1997 ; Spanier et al. , 1998b ) . FIXai also use successfully several critically ill patient require cardiopulmonary bypass set extracorporeal circuit extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( Spanier et al. , 1998a ) physician Columbia College Physicians Surgeons , compassionate care basis . Thus , FIXa validate target anticoagulant therapy coronary revascularization procedure ( CABG PCI ) , treatment prevention thrombosis patient suffer acute coronary syndrome .</detailed_description>
