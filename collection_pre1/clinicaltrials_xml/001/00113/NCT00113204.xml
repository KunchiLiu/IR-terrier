	<brief_summary>This phase 1 clinical trial find safe , maximum tolerate dose IPI-504 patient relapse and/or relapse , refractory multiple myeloma . This study examine IPI-504 absorbed , distribute , metabolize , eliminate body . The study also evaluate potential anti-tumor activity IPI-504 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study IPI-504 Patients With Relapsed Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPI-504 novel small molecule inhibitor heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) , emerge recently identify target cancer therapy . Hsp90 protein chaperone play central role regulate protein homeostasis . Hsp90 regulate stability key protein ( call `` client protein '' ) keep appropriate three dimensional shape perform cellular function . In addition , many protein stabilize Hsp90 oncoproteins cell-signaling protein important cancer cell proliferation cancer cell survival . Thus Hsp90 , single molecular target central integrator multiple pathway important cancer , ideal novel target oncologic therapy . Selective inhibition Hsp90 affect multiple downstream mechanism disrupt tumor growth selectively kill cancer cell . The anti-neoplastic effect Hsp90 inhibition demonstrate vitro vivo variety different hematologic solid tumor include multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
