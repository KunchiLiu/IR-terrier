	<brief_summary>Treatment HIV repair immune system , continuous treatment expensive cause side effect . Would well treat intermittently , e.g . stop treatment immune system recover , start damage reappears ? That question STACCATO propose answer . Approximately 500 patient recruit trial 2002 2004 . One third treat continuously ; two third , treatment interrupt whenever CD4 count , measure immune recovery , exceed 350 . At end 2005 , two treatment group compare order see fare well regard amount drug use , side effect , CD4 count , development resistance treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Staccato : A Trial CD4 Guided Treatment Interruption , Compared Continuous Treatment , HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous treatment successful diminishing disease death cause HIV . However , continuous treatment expensive . Intermittent treatment always cost less continuous treatment , therefore potential facilitate access highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) develop country . HAART also cause many undesirable effect . Intermittent treatment decrease exposure drug therefore expect decrease side effect . STACCATO randomise trial intermittent versus continuous anti-retroviral treatment . At least 600 patient HAART , viremia 50 copies/ml CD4 count 350 cells/ml randomise one two arm , 1:2 proportion : - Arm 1 : Continuation ( control ) arm : Drugs continue change accord current guideline good clinical practice . - Arm 2 : CD4-guided arm : Drugs discontinue reintroduce accord CD4 count , HAART administer CD4 count &lt; 350 cells/ml . Randomized treatment continue average approximately 2 year , follow period 12 24 week â€™ continuous treatment , patient arm . Endpoints : The amount drug use , side effect , viremia CD4 count , number clinical event , end randomize treatment period , 12 24 week later . A subproject study effect treatment interruption resistance development , mutation proviral DNA proviral DNA level .</detailed_description>
