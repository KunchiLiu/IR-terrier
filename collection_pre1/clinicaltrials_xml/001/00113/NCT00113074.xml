	<brief_title>Preventing Weight Gain Controlling Blood Pressure During Smoking Cessation Hypertensive Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High blood pressure ( BP ) , hypertension , major risk factor cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Hypertension associate elevate risk several cardiovascular complication , include coronary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , congestive heart failure , stroke , well increase risk renal disease . Although significant advance detection treatment high BP , approximately one four adult United States hypertensive . Cigarette smoke account 400,000 premature death year country alone , make leading cause morbidity mortality . Evidence several epidemiological study demonstrate , level BP , smoke substantially increase risk cardiovascular complication associate hypertension . While cigarette smoke hypertension increase risk cardiovascular disease , two risk factor act synergistically produce great risk combine independent effect . Despite considerable health risk , smoke among people hypertension common , prevalence approach observe among normal BP . Unfortunately , although quit smoke especially important patient high BP , smoke cessation produce nontrivial weight gain , average 5 kg , may exacerbate hypertension many patient disorder . Several study document significant elevation BP follow smoke cessation , well increase prevalence hypertension quit smoking . As , important develop effective intervention assist quit smoke prevent weight gain . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The objective trial recruit 750 smoker Stage 1 hypertension prehypertension ( base JNC VII criterion ) . The trial provide participant brief , validate , combine behavioral pharmacologic smoke cessation intervention . Additionally , study randomly assign participant abstinent smoke upon complete cessation intervention either 12-week weight management BP control program self-help material target lifestyle modification . The primary endpoint change BP among quit smoker one-year follow-up . Secondary endpoint include change body weight , dietary intake , urinary sodium excretion , physical activity , relapse smoking . Exploratory endpoint include change hypertensive status ( e.g. , movement prehypertensive hypertensive JNC VII criterion ) change BP medication status . This multi-site clinical trial , study location Rochester , Minnesota , Iowa City , IA . The Rochester , MN site currently close recruitment .</detailed_description>
