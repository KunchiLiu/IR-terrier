	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer treat lapatinib . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . Secondary I . Determine clinical response rate ( partial complete response ) patient treat drug . II . Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine impact prognostic variable , include platinum sensitivity , performance status , cellular histology ( clear cell mucinous type ) , patient treat drug . IV . Correlate tumor level expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , phosphorylated EGFR , HER2/neu , Ki-67 , determine immunohistochemistry , clinical response patient treated drug . V. Correlate EGFR mutation tumor DNA clinical response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 12-26 month .</detailed_description>
