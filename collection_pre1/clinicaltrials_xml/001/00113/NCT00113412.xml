	<brief_summary>One measurement HIV infect person ’ risk progress AIDS number viral particle HIV blood ( call “ viral load ” ) . In previous phase I/II study , SP01A observe significantly low amount HIV blood , improve quality life ( well subject 's felt ) , favorable safety profile ( minimal side effect ) , well tolerate . Moreover , vitro test SP01A : ( 1 ) demonstrate comparable great efficacy currently approve anti-HIV drug prevent HIV virus replication ; ( 2 ) observe minimal toxic effect human cell ; ( 3 ) demonstrate significant efficacy prevent virus replication HIV virus strain resist currently approve anti-HIV treatment . Based result , SP01A demonstrate promise new novel anti-HIV treatment . The goal study look dose response , efficacy , safety SP01A monotherapy , give capsule swallow , treatment HIV-infected subject . The investigator want see SP01A low amount HIV blood . Subjects assign chance 1 4 group . Neither subject study doctor nurse know dose study drug subject take subject receive placebo ( capsule look like study drug contain active ingredient ) . At end 10-day study , subject offer test virus resistance approve drug ( genotype ) transfer physician continued treatment FDA-approved antiretroviral therapy . If subject experience side effect , continue past end study , monitor side effect go away .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Oral Entry Inhibitor , SP01A , Treatment-Experienced HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo control Phase II study orally administer SP01A monotherapy treatment HIV-infected patient evidence resistance currently available antiretroviral therapy . This monotherapy study focus HIV-infected subject previously fail antiretroviral regimen ( treatment failure ; define individual evidence viral load go despite take anti-HIV drug precisely prescribe ) . HIV-positive subject evaluate pre-study period . Following 4-week washout period ( ensure previous anti-HIV drug longer remain system ) , study group initiate 10-day monotherapy study . At conclusion 10-day monotherapy study , subject option test determine best anti-HIV treatment combination treatment . Further treatment , indicate , limited FDA-approved anti-HIV treatment . The primary objective study ass dose-response , efficacy safety orally administer SP01A monotherapy treatment ( study drug alone ) HIV-infected subject evidence resistance currently available anti-HIV drug therapy . The primary analysis reduction viral load ( log10 ) within SP01A study arm well within placebo arm measure first day drug administration ( DAY-1 ( Baseline ) ) last day study drug administration ( DAY-11 ( Study-End ) ) . The secondary analysis reduction viral load ( log10 ) across SP01A active arm measure DAY-1 ( Baseline ) DAY-11 ( Study-End ) . The investigator may also test HIV patient 's blood determine one HIV strain exists resistant currently approve anti-HIV drug . This test conduct DAY-1 Day-11 . Additionally , investigator may test determine whether virus develop resistance study drug DAY-11 . Safety assess visit laboratory evaluation , physical examination and/or question side effect . In event side effect , dose study drug may stop accord provision outline protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible inclusion study , patient must fulfill follow criterion prior first day study drug ( i.e . Study Day1 ) unless otherwise note . Patient must capable give informed consent . The principal investigator study nurse responsible obtain write informed consent potential patient prior conduct test screen visit . 2 . Patient HIVpositive treatmentexperienced virologic failure document resistance . Treatmentexperienced virologic failure define patient meet follow criterion ; ( 1 ) previous experience antiretroviral therapy least two approve antiretroviral class ( i.e . treatment nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , and/or protease inhibitor ) three six month ; ( 2 ) increase HIV RNA treatment previously lower viral load low undetectable level ; ( 3 ) increase viremia ( HIV RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/mL ) least two viral load test confirm fail regimen . A patient need currently therapy . A patient currently stable antiretroviral regimen successfully suppress maintain viremia low detectable level ( HIV RNA &lt; 5,000 copies/mL ) eligible entry study . Patient antiviral medication , include unapproved experimental treatment HIV antiretrovirals , least 4 week prior Study Day1 ( baseline ) . The patient may initiate 4 week period screening , , judgment principal investigator , patient qualifies study . Patient least 18 year age old 60 year age . Patient capable adhere protocol . Patient CD4+ count &gt; 50 cells/ml . Patient viral load &gt; 5000 copies/ml . Patient Karnofsky score great equal 60 . Female patient childbearing potential : ( 1 ) negative urine pregnancy test screening , agree use condom another form contraception start study ; ( 2 ) incapable become pregnant . Patients ineligible participate study ANY follow criterion meet . Patients know suspected allergy procaine hydrochloride . Patients use sulfonamide ( include Septra/Bactrim ) . Sulfonamides use SP01A , procaine inactivate . If patient must treat Septra/Bactrim , patient remove study . Patients glaucoma use anticholinesterase inhibitor ( Humorsol [ demecarium bromide ] echothiophate iodide , Floropryl [ isoflurophate ] , IsoptoEserine [ physostigmine salicylate ] ) . Anticholinesterase inhibitor use SP01A , since anticholinesterase inhibit breakdown procaine hydrochloride . Patients SGOT baseline value &gt; 3 time upper limit . Patients SGPT baseline value &gt; 3 time upper limit . Patients creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/ dl . Patients absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000 cells/mm3 . Patients platelet baseline value &lt; 75,000 cells/µl . Patients currently active opportunistic infection . Prophylaxis Mycobacterium avium intracellulare ( MAI ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , herpes permit ( exclude treatment Sulfonamides ) . Females pregnant breast feeding . Female patient childbearing age either use dual contraception abstain sexual intercourse clinical study . Patients less 6 month life expectancy . Patients active hepatitis ( viral drug induce ) . Patients cancer , except peripheral ( dermal ) Kaposi ’ sarcoma . Patients dialysis . Patients currently active alcohol substance abuse problem . Patients medical , psychological , psychiatric substance use problem , opinion principal investigator , interfere patient ’ ability complete study . A patient currently stable antiretroviral regimen successfully suppress maintain viremia low detectable level ( HIV RNA &lt; 5,000 copies/ml ) eligible entry study .</criteria>
