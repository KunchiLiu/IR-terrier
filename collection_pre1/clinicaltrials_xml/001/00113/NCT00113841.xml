	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate clinical tolerance response curcumin alone combination Bioperine patient multiple myeloma . 2 . To compare pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics curcumin curcumin + Bioperine evaluate effect Bioperine bioavailability curcumin . 3 . To evaluate biologic effect curcumin alone combination Bioperine expression NF-kB related gene Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Curcumin ( Diferuloylmethane Derivative ) With Without Bioperine Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curcumin , yellow substance extract plant Curcuma longa , commonly use food additive . It natural anti-inflammatory compound show anti-tumor activity laboratory . Bioperine pepper extract increase absorption nutrient supplement . In study , 6 patient time randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group 3 patient . One group ( Arm A ) receive curcumin alone . The group ( Arm B ) receive curcumin combination Bioperine . There equal chance either group . While study may receive standard supportive care appropriate . Both study agent take mouth two time day . Each group five dose level curcumin , start low dose . After 6 patient enrol first level ( 3 arm ) , next group treat new dose level . You always receive dose treatment , continue least 12 week unless evidence disease gotten worse intolerable side effect occur . You may receive treatment one year depend response treatment . You may treat outpatient may receive treatment home . You ask return M. D. Anderson every 4 week evaluation physical exam . This investigational study . A total 30 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
