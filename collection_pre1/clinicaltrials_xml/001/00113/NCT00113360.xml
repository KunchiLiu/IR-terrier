	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary endpoint : -Assess clinical activity RAD 001 plus depot octreotide define progression free survival ( PFS ) duration define RECIST criterion treat untreated patient metastatic , unresectable low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . Secondary endpoint : - Assess progression free survival duration patient metastatic , unresectable low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma treat RAD 001 plus depot octreotide . - Assess safety RAD 001 plus depot octreotide patient metastatic , unresectable low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . - To determine expression/phosphorylation status component mTOR signal pathway primary tumor , order determine whether marker use predictor sensitivity combination RAD001 octreotide . - To determine effect combination RAD001 octreotide expression phosphorylation mTOR 's target accessible tumor tissue , order identify potential pharmacodynamics marker response drug combination . - To observe effect treatment RAD001 plasma angiogenic biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RAD001 new drug design block protein important growth cancer cell . Octreotide Depot FDA approve treatment carcinoid syndrome hormonal symptom certain islet cell carcinoma . Octreotide Depot may also help block certain protein important tumor growth . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask question medical history medication currently take take past . You complete physical exam heart rate , temperature , breathe rate , blood pressure , height , weight measure . You ask ability perform every day activity . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) scan ( either Computed Tomography/CT Magnetic Resonance Imaging/MRI ) evaluate cancer . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If screening evaluation show eligible take part study , may begin treatment . You take RAD001 mouth day , every day study . You take fast state light , fat-free meal . You take RAD001 time day . Octreotide Depot give injection muscle either buttock every 4 week study . This do M. D. Anderson . Four week ( 28 day ) call one course treatment . Clinic visit occur every 2 week first 4 week every 4 week . At clinic visit , ask question medical history medication currently take take past . You complete physical exam heart rate , temperature , breathe rate , blood pressure , height , weight measure . You ask ability perform every day activity . Blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test collect every 2 week first 8 week . After , blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) collect every 4 week . CT MRI scan ( ) perform every 12 week . If sample tumor tissue remove previously available , analyzed expression protein may effect tumor growth . However , sample available , ask undergo biopsy collect tissue . This sample may analyze time study . If experience severe side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos RAD001 and/or Octreotide Depot . You may continue receive least 12 course study treatment unless disease get bad , decide take part longer , doctor decides best interest stop treatment . It may possible continue treatment beyond 12 course benefit treatment . When stop study treatment , ask test evaluation do . About 4 teaspoon blood take routine lab test , You also physical exam CT scan MRI scan do check size location disease . This investigational study . RAD001 investigational commercially available . The drug combination study also investigational . RAD001 manufacture Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation . About 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
