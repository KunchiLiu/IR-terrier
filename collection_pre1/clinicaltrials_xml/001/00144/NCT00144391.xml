To diagnose central adrenal deficiency , patient glucocorticoid replacement insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) ( patient cardiovascular disease exclude ) 0.1U/kg insulin give iv peak cortisol value less 20ug/dl , associate glucose level less 40mg/dL consider consistent central adrenal insufficiency . Patients glucocorticoid replacement evaluate examine prior workup determine evidence central adrenal deficiency , ITT require document central adrenal deficiency ( ITT still perform determine GH deficiency ) . 2 . To diagnose central gonadal deficiency , patient ask amenorrhea oligomenorrhea prior estrogen replacement . An FAH le 5 MIU/ML use confirm central primary gonadal deficiency . In select patient diagnosis central gonadal deficiency unclear , may perform LHRH stimulation test , 100 ug iv LHRH ( Factrel ) give peak LH response le 15 MIU/ML consider consistent central gonadotropin insufficiency . 3 .
