	<brief_summary>Objective : Our overall objective test hypothesis health child chronic respiratory symptom chronic exposure environmental hazard improve combination standard home maintenance intervention set interim control target repair intervention . I . Background : The Bi-State Kansas City Enhanced Enterprise Community ( KCEEC ) one pervasive poverty , unemployment general distress . This area also area poor environmental health disproportionate number child lead poisoning , asthma , home injury . In May 2001 , Metropolitan ( Kansas City ) Health Council release report urge implementation strategy address grow concern . They state , “ Environmental assessment intervention home , school , workplace need promote indoor air quality thereby help prevent asthma asthma flare-up , ” combination need , “ trained community-based peer educator need work families/communities area high asthma incidence , ” . The need major rehabilitation echoed 1999 Consolidated Plan , well community development housing official . The KC CERT project respond concern demonstrate low-cost , replicable intervention strategy impact health safety child family . By provide train employment opportunity resident high-risk area ass , prevent remediate environmental hazard , project promotes sustain systematic change within KCEEC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study observational study . It manage project director HHN Environmental Health Program Manager CMH . Following enrollment study , health assessment focus specific respiratory problem lead exposure perform . Eligible subject must age 2 17 year age , stay home minimum 4 night per week . The home environment also assess use specific set on-site laboratory sampling analysis . Once study analysis complete , report write provide family . The health home assessment use presentation in-home education relate specific strategy create maintain safe healthy home . Once initial assessment complete , family receive set standard targeted intervention together total $ 2000 value . If house need $ 2000 worth intervention , family would qualify participate study would offer alternative resource HHN , UMKC Center City , Home Center . The interim control recommend assessment provide within 60 day in-home education . These interim control include set standard intervention provide home , addition , set site-specific target intervention base assessment finding . Six month intervention implement , child ’ health home assess use instrument , procedure , questionnaire , number type sample initial assessment take . This ensure consistency quality data gathering . Recruitment Subjects : The Healthy Homes Network recruit participant community physicians clinic , organization affiliate HHN include health department housing authority , CMH Emergency Room , CMH Allergy Clinic , CMH primary care clinic . HHN recruit advertising medium necessary ( see propose ad include ) , CMH name LOGO appear ad . Subjects refer CMH health evaluation . Expected Sample Size : Total study : 200 CMH : 200 Inclusion Criteria : Participants qualify study one follow health condition : persistent asthma define NHLBI guideline , chronic respiratory symptom , and/or lead level equal 15 microgram per deciliter . They must age 2 17 year age , stay home minimum 4 night per week , reside KCEEC ( Defined city limit Kansas City Kansas Kansas City Missouri ) . They also live housing , either rental self-owned , least 6 month reasonable expectation remain housing least one additional year . To qualify intervention phase study do HHN , home must $ 2000 estimate intervention cost . Examples house would qualify include : A house need new roof , house extensive amount flake lead paint , house significant structural problem . Exclusion Criteria : Any child meet age residency requirement . Any home $ 2000 worth maintenance repair problem . Any home emergent , life threatening condition . Children chronic disease ( leukemia , diabetes etc ) refer HHN CMH appropriate medical service , agency , organization community resource . There one study group ( immediate intervention group ) . In group , child ’ health evaluate , home environmental health assess report family , family receive in-home education . Within 60 day in-home education , series interim control home provide HHN use specific set standard intervention site-specific set target intervention base assessment finding . The home check ensure intervention properly do . After 6 month , child ’ health reevaluate environmental health home assess second time evaluate impact child ’ health . Observations/Measurements : Goal 1 : Demonstrate improvement overall health chronic symptom child Pre/Post Measures : 1 . Health Assessment Questionnaire 2 . Asthma severity ( assign blind physician – base health assessment spirometry [ child &gt; 5 year old ] ) 3 . Medication dosage ( take family health information ) 4 . Blood lead level ( measured clinical lab ) 5 . Allergen Specific IgG &amp; IgE ( measure clinical lab ) 6 . Number day school miss ( take family health survey ) 7 . Number day in-patient hospital ( take hospital record ) 8 . Number visit physician/ER ( take clinic record ) 9 . Quality life rating ( SF12 form ) 10 . Asthma specific quality life rating ( Juniper et . al . ) Goal 2 : Reduce specific environmental hazard potentially affect health intervention Pre/Post Measures : 1 . IAQ Survey ( On-site analysis Temp . RH . CO2 , CO , THC , VOC , TVOC ) 2 . Allergen content house dust ( lab measurement immunoassay ) 3 . Total Particulate Analysis ( on-site laser particle analysis ) 4 . Airborne spore level ( measure spore trap determination ) 5 . Chemical Exposure Hazard ( home assessment site-specific chemical analysis ) Goal 3 : Demonstrate effectiveness low-cost intervention Measures : . Differential environmental exposure factor health symptom factor enrolment study 6 month home intervention . ( Evaluated statistical method ; mostly student t-test ) . Power analysis indicate adequate power detect 50 % change allergen level dust 95 % confidence level 66 house group . Goal 4 : Reduce specific environmental hazard potentially affect health in-home education . Pre/Post Measures : 1 . IAQ Survey ( On-site analysis Temp . RH . CO2 , CO , THC , TVOC , O3 ) 2 . Allergen content house dust ( lab measurement immunoassay ) 3 . Total Particulate Analysis ( on-site laser particle analysis ) 4 . Airborne spore level ( measure spore trap determination ) 5 . Chemical Exposure Hazard ( home assessment site-specific chemical analysis )</detailed_description>
