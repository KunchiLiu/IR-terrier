	<brief_title>Multifactorial Intervention Cardiovascular Risk Factors Subjects With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects peripheral arterial disease show increase cardiovascular risk . It think improve control cardiovascular risk factor ( hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , diabetes , smoke ) could beneficial reduce cardiovascular risk . However , usual care subject ( mainly primary care ) associate optimal control cardiovascular risk factor . We hypothesise intensive multifactorial treatment Cardiovascular Risk Unit could improve control cardiovascular risk factor . To test hypothesis perform control , randomize , open , parallel trial . Subjects recruit Vascular Surgery Unit randomise two group : 1. usual care ( control group ) ; 2. intensive care ( intervention group ) . Randomization stratify presence/absence diabetes mellitus use seal envelope . Patients assign receive usual care ( general practitioner possibility refer specialist ) compare assign undergo intensive multifactorial intervention . This intervention involve strict treatment goal ( LDL-cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dl , blood pressure &lt; 130/80 , HbA1c &lt; 7 % , smoke ) achieve behavior modification ( diet , physical activity , smoke cessation ) stepwise introduction pharmacologic therapy hypercholesterolemia , hypertension diabetes . This multifactorial intervention overseen multidisciplinary team ( endocrinologist , nurse , dietitian ) Hospital Sabadell ( Corporación Parc Taulí ) . The treatment goal usual care group general practitioner care patient include study inform strict treatment goal . Patients intensive-therapy receive 6 schedule individual consultation one year ( baseline 2,4 , 6 9 month inclusion ) .Primary secondary outcome evaluate 12 month inclusion .</detailed_description>
