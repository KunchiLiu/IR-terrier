	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Increase Identifies Critically Ill Patients High Risk Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis major cause mortality Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Efforts make reduce time need diagnose sepsis order reduce mortality sepsis-related multi-organ dysfunction . Markers inflammation C-reactive protein ( CRP ) White Blood Cell count ( WBC ) prove far ideal identify critically ill patient need antimicrobial therapy , sensitivity specificity bacterial infection low . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) 13 kDa 116 amino acid polypeptide , initially describe prohormone Calcitonin , hormone calcium metabolism produce medullary C-cells Thyroid gland5-7 . However , recent study demonstrate variant PCT associate infection produce tissue . As kinetic study baboon human show rapid release within 2-4 hour injection bacteria bacterial toxin , PCT substance release rapidly CRP . The plasma half-life PCT close 24 hour . Measurements PCT healthy individual show low serum level ( &lt; 0.05 ng/ml ) . In 1993 , Assicot et al . report elevated level serum procalcitonin closely related onset bacterial infection seemingly correlate severity infection . Several clinical study detect high PCT level patient evidence systemic bacterial infection , relatively low PCT level , hand , occur patient local bacterial infection viral infection . Other study show low moderately elevate PCT uninfected patient major surgery , trauma myocardial infarction . A reduced usage antimicrobial therapy demonstrate treatment guide PCT patient suspect low respiratory tract infection , admit medical emergency department . Only study , however , investigated PCT day-to-day change several day respect clinical outcome population risk contract serious infection . The aim present study assess ability PCT- , CRP- leucocyte measurement early identification critically ill patient , high risk mortality . The study one-year study . Methods Patients From January 2 December 2002 , conduct observational study include patient ( except livertransplanted patient ) admit multi-disciplinary intensive care unit 4131 Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital , secondary tertiary reference hospital . Patients include admittance ICU . In case re-admittance , measurement first admittance include study . When sepsis suspect , performed culture sample suspect site antibiotic therapy initiate . Surveillance culture sample perform twice week patient , include blood culture indwell catheter . Data co-morbidity mortality register real-time verified via central hospital register Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital . In analysis , mortality define all-cause mortality . The primary endpoint 90-day survival ; secondary endpoint survival admit ICU 30-day survival . Blood sample Blood sample PCT measurement collect nursing staff ICU daily basis 6.00 a.m. 7.30 a.m. accordance assume half life PCT . PCT analyse perform laboratory technician Department Clinical Microbiology , use immunoluminometric assay ( Lumitest-PCT , B.R.A.H.M.S . Diagnostica , Berlin , Germany ) . The threshold detection 0.1 ng/ml serum , accord manufacturer . Blood sample collect routine test accordance ethical procedure hospital . All blood sample store 4o Celsius , analyse within maximally 72 hour . As control PCT analysis storage , make double determination . Ten blood sample analyse single-blinded three time daily standardise time three day . PCT-day-to-day change analysis Standard empiric antimicrobial treatment sepsis ICU include : Meropenem Ciprofloxacin , relevant supplement : Metronidazole , Vancomycin , Linezolid occasionally antibiotic accord clinical finding , patient tolerance , suspect site infection bacterial culture foci surveillance culture combine susceptibility pattern . Treatment invasive fungal infection include Caspofungin , Liposomal Amphotericin B Voriconazole , combination therapy accord Candida specie identification susceptibility pattern Minimal Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC ) surveillance culture .</detailed_description>
