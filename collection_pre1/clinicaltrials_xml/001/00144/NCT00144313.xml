	<detailed_description>In 1970s , Alaska Natives high rate hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection US . Because , routine vaccination Alaska Native infant begin birth implemented 1985 . Hepatitis B vaccination program result significant decline acute chronic HBV infection among Alaska Natives , virtually new chronic infection observe among vaccinated cohort . Since 1991 , American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend hepatitis B vaccination infant , preferably begin birth . Beginning vaccination infancy prevents childhood acquisition HBV , provide immunity HBV individual reach age may increase risk exposure due high-risk behavior ( i.e. , sexual activity drug use ) occupation . The success vaccination strategy contingent vaccine able induce long-lasting protection . The duration protection confer hepatitis B vaccination initiate birth firmly establish . Over 95 % vaccinee clinical study develop response three-dose primary hepatitis B vaccination series , define development antibody hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( anti-HBs ) concentration great than10 milliInternational Units per milliliter ( mIU/mL ) blood . Within 5-10 year primary series , anti-HBs concentration decline many vaccinee , concentration fall 10mIU/mL , even detectable level . However , despite low anti-HBs concentration , HBV infection ( measure presence marker infection hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] antibody hepatitis B core antigen [ anti-HBc ] ) rare person show respond primary vaccine series . Continued protection HBV infection child likely provide immune memory cell generate time primary series . An immunologic memory response ( also term anamnestic response ) evaluate measure effect additional ( booster ) dose hepatitis B vaccine . An anamnestic response generally define rapid ( within 14-30 day ) two-fold great increase anti-HBs titer least 20mIU/mL . This signify immune memory cell capable generate rapid rise anti-HBs still functional would protect HBV infection . Blood test identify memory B cell specific vaccine antigens available , could use provide additional evidence immune memory.9 Although good evidence immunologic memory HBsAg exceed persistence measurable antibody , study examine last protection ( &gt; 10 year ) HBV infection low-risk population vaccinate birth recombinant vaccine.10 Most study demonstrate long term protection infection persistent immune memory despite low anti-HBs concentration perform among child live area HBV infection endemic , whose mother chronic HBV infection ( i.e. , child high risk perinatal childhood HBV infection ) . Studies conduct among Alaska Native child demonstrate `` low-risk '' child ( i.e. , infant bear HBsAg-negative mother HBsAg-positive person live household ) also concentrations anti-HBs fall 10mIU/mL later childhood . In cohort 36 child know respond recombinant vaccine series start birth , none retain level anti-HBs ≥ 10mIU/mL 7.5 year age . In addition , three child fail exhibit anamnestic response booster dose give average age 7.5 year . At present time , neither measurement anti-HBs concentration booster dose ( ) recommend low-risk child hepatitis B vaccine primary series give infancy . Low-risk Alaska Native child receive recombinant hepatitis B vaccination start birth reach adolescence , period risk HBV infection sexual transmission transmission inject drug use likely occur . More information need determine protection HBV infection among child enter adolescence adequate booster dose ( ) might necessary . The specific objective follow : Primary 1 . To determine anti-HBs concentration among adolescent age 11-14 year old respond primary series recombinant hepatitis B vaccine initiate birth . 2 . To assess anti-HBs response booster dose recombinant hepatitis B vaccine among adolescent previously show respond primary series recombinant hepatitis B vaccine initiate birth . 3 . To determine whether specific immune memory cell present among study cohort member . Secondary 1 . To correlate response booster dose hepatitis B vaccine 1. initial response primary series 2. concentration anti-HBs age time booster dose . 2 . To document side effect person receive fourth dose hepatitis B vaccine . 3 . To determine proportion child receive responded primary vaccine series infancy subsequently become infected HBV demonstrate presence anti-HBc and/or HBsAg .</detailed_description>
