	<brief_title>Open Label Study NVP+CBV Treatment Women Who Have Received sdNVP pMTCT HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label , single arm , multicentre study determine virologic immunologic responsiveness woman , previously receive regimen nevirapine prevention MTCT , regimen nevirapine ZDV+3TC treatment . As well evaluate proportion patient fail treatment 24 48 week , evaluate resistance profile HIV isolate patient fail nevirapine ZDV+3TC treatment . Study Hypothesis : When drug lead selection resistant viral population withdraw original wildtype virus , time , become predominant virus . However , low frequency ( level detection ) drug resistant viral sub-populations may retain could mean drug resistant variant might reappear rapidly drug reintroduce part combination therapy later stage.Therefore study propose evaluate whether impact single dose nevirapine prevention MTCT subsequent response standard HAART regimen contain nevirapine . Comparison ( ) : trial 1100.1090</detailed_description>
