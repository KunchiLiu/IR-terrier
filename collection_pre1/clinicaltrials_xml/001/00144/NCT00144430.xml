	<brief_summary>This multicenter trial Pediatric Blood Marrow Transplant Consortium . The Primary hypothesis study effect potent immunosuppressive agent target lymphocyte , pentostatin show sustain response pediatric subject severe chronic GVHD . Secondary hypothesis include infection toxicity rate pentostatin set acceptable give lack severe myelosuppression , subject refractory chronic GVHD significant QOL impairment symptomatology . These may change subject treat chronic GVHD pentostatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentostatin High Risk Refractory Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To participate study , subject must diagnose chronic Graft versus Host Disease refractory therapy consider high risk ( i.e . low platelet count , progressive onset great 50 % body surface area affect ) . Subjects must fail 2 immunosuppressive regimen order consider trial . Eligible subject receive intravenous pentostatin every 2 week 24 week . If subject complete response , therapy end 24 week . If subject partial mixed response stable disease , continue study receive pentostatin 52 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Allogeneic BMT SCT recipient . Includes cord blood peripheral blood . Age 021 year . FOR REFRACTORY GROUP : Diagnosis chronic GVHD , confirm biopsy organ SCT . Given variability among center , biopsy need say , least , `` consistent GVHD . '' If medical contraindication ( severe sclerosis poor wound heal ) need open procedure obtain fascial biopsy photograph document skin abnormal ROM study may submit instead . If current GVHD represent episode previously biopsied , new biopsy necessary . If previous biopsy episode go remission new episode GVHD , new biopsy necessary . To eligible portion study , patient 's chronic GVHD extensive limit , define : All subject extensive chronic GVHD eligible . These subject must meet following criterion : Generalized skin involvement ( &gt; 50 % BSA ) OR Localized skin involvement and/or liver dysfunction plus least one following : Liver histology show chronic aggressive hepatitis , bridge necrosis , cirrhosis , ductopenia . Eye involvement ( Schirmer 's test &lt; 5 mm wet ) Involvement minor salivary gland oral mucosa lip biopsy Involvement target organ OR Involvement least 2 target organ . ( Target organs list `` Examples characteristic manifestation ) Subjects limited chronic GVHD ( define skin involvement le 50 % BSA isolate organ involvement 51 also eligible . Examples subject would limit sclerodermatous fascial skin disease oral disease unresponsive therapy may debilitate patient . Subjects isolated refractory liver chronic GVHD may go study provide liver histology . Examples characteristic manifestation include : skin change rash , lichenoid change , sclerodermatous change , hypopigmentation , hyperpigmentation , loss appendage ( hair follicle , sweat gland ) , alopecia oral change erythema , lichenoid change , ulceration hepatic involvement obstructive jaundice , chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis GI involvement nausea , vomit , weight loss , esophageal dysmotility , malabsorption , chronic diarrhea , abdominal cramp sicca syndrome dry eye mouth ( decreased tearing , keratoconjunctivitis , oral mucosal erythema ulceration ) inflammatory condition myositis , arthritis , polyserositis To eligible portion study subject must refractory disease define : Development new site disease treat chronic GVHD* ( These criterion meet time posttransplant treatment chronic GVHD begin . This include subject develop new site disease steroid therapy , taper steroid therapy , therapy . The necessary element TREATMENT chronic GVHD NEW area disease . OR Progression initially affect site chronic GVHD treat chronic GVHD , chronic GVHD worsens . This type patient worsen initially affect area time . This include subject judge steroiddependent , taper steroid initiate , flare organ . OR Failure improve despite least 1 month standard therapy ( These subject show response ( improved worse ) cGVHD therapy . These therapy include , limited : Prednisone average 0.5 mg/kg/day equivalent steroid . Another immunosuppressive regimen ( e.g.. FK506/MMF photopheresis ) . FOR HIGHRISK GROUP : The vast majority subject identify initial diagnosis chronic GVHD subject progress acute chronic . These subject likely steroid acute GVHD skin change rapidly shift simple erythema lichenoid/pebbly appearance consistent chronic GVHD . For inclusion arm , follow require : Extensive skin involvement ( &gt; 50 % BSA ) either lichenoid sclerodermatous change . Either one follow highrisk feature : Thrombocytopenia ( PLT &lt; 100,000 ) Progressive onset ( i.e . Changes suggestive progression acute chronic ) . This include , limited , skin become increasingly scaly , pebbly , raise , lymphedematous . It unusual see transition even day 100 , especially nonmyeloablative SCT DLI . If question regard change whether qualify , call PI , Dr. David Jacobsohn , 7738803694 . A biopsy SCT show acute chronic GVHD . A biopsy show acute GVHD acceptable clinical picture progress chronic GVHD . Patient prednisone â‰¥2 mg/kg/day ( equivalent dose another steroid ) receive 7 day therapy . More two previous regimen treat chronic GVHD . A regimen purpose study define adequate trial immunosuppressive immunosuppressive combination ( patient give drug drug 3 month unless clear progression regimen ) . Calculated Cr . Clearance &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 Active infection respond oral IV antibiotic . Subjects family unwilling firmly commit return followup dose appointment . Use investigational agent past 30 day ( include use licensed agent indication list package insert ) . Pregnancy nurse mother ; Females childbearing potential sexually active male use effective contraception study . Active venoocclusive disease liver . Bronchiolitis obliterans ( define purpose study respiratory symptom shortness breath cough FEV1 &lt; 50 % ) . Karnofsky performance score le 40 ( Lansky performance le 40 subject 16 year age ) .</criteria>
