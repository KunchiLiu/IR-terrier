	<brief_summary>Efficacious antipsychotic medication treatment schizophrenia available ; however , antipsychotic regimen frequently achieve potential poor medication adherence . To date , medication adherence intervention widely adopt sustained `` real-world '' practice setting . One reason substantial resource investment necessary implement sustain available intervention . In response problem , develop patient-centered adherence intervention base patient-identified barrier , facilitator , motivator ( BFMs ) medication adherence . The intervention include BFM survey ( checklist preference weight exercise determine patient 's important BFM ) brief list adherence enhance suggestion ( Options List ) tailor patient-identified BFMs compatible CPRS . The long-term objective propose research improve antipsychotic medication adherence clinical outcome patient schizophrenia use cost-effective medication adherence intervention . The short-term objective refine test patient-centered medication adherence intervention VA patient schizophrenia specifically : 1 . Enhance feasibility acceptability BFM intervention reduce burden patient mental health provider BFM checklist item reduction , provider intervention input , patient intervention input . We hypothesize use end-user input result least 80 % intervention patient documentation BFM intervention CPRS . 2 . Compare effect BFM intervention versus usual care change medication adherence schizophrenia symptom severity . We hypothesize intervention result ) great medication adherence b ) low schizophrenia symptom severity usual care . 3 . Exploratory objective : compare effect BFM intervention versus usual care change patient health-related quality life . We hypothesize intervention result great health-related quality life usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BFM intervention refinement accomplish five phase . Phase one include reduce number item BFM checklist administer expanded checklist least 50 patient schizophrenia use standard psychometric item-reduction strategy create short checklist . In phase two conduct mental health provider focus group discuss content Options List delivery intervention . In phase three automate BFM intervention use exist web-based computer touch-screen platform . In phase four conduct individual patient debrief interview 30 patient evaluate understandability BFM survey . In phase five evaluate test/re-test reliability survey new sample 30 patient . BFM intervention implementation include stratify randomization patient BFM intervention usual care . BFM intervention evaluation include test feasibility , acceptability , outcomes associate intervention versus usual care single trial 200 patient ( 100 intervention 100 usual care ) .</detailed_description>
