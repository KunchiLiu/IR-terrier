	<brief_title>R-CHOP-14 Versus R-CHOP-21 Darbepoetin Alpha Patients Aged 60-80 Years With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient age 60 75 year diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , shorten interval course CHOP combination ( CHOP-14 ) , improve complete response rate , progression free survival overall survival . The addition Rituximab standard CHOP ( R-CHOP ) also show improve complete remission rate ( CR ) , event-free survival ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) elderly patient B-DLCL . The aim study test hypothesis increase dose intensity shorten interval two course R-CHOP ( R-CHOP-14 ) could improve result R-CHOP . Anemia frequent diagnosis treatment aggressive lymphoma . In previous LNH 98-5 study , 72 % patient , diagnosis , hemoglobin level inferior 13 g/dl . Moreover , treatment , 92 % patient hemoglobin level less 13 g/dl 30 % transfuse . The presence anemia diagnosis indicator poor prognosis multivariate analysis . This prognosis impact could probably explain cellular level tumor . Tumoral hypoxia increase presence anemia . Due hypoxia , expression tumor growth factor may increase : e.a VEGF induction expression multi drug resistance ( MDR1 ) observe . This resistance treatment also due inhibition genotoxic activity free radical induce ionised radiation chemotherapy . Experimentally , negative impact hypoxia efficacy chemotherapy demonstrate sarcoma cell line doxorubicin , vincristine cyclophosphamide . Finally , hypoxia induced expression apoptosis resistance gene induce growth advantage apoptosis resistant tumoral line . Improvement survival patient receive erythropoetin chemotherapy radiotherapy suggest study patient treat neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy head neck cancer . Erythropoetin could act protect several normal tissue chemotherapy thus could decrease treatment related morbidity . Darbepoetin alfa new recombinant protein stimulate erythropoiesis . Thus , use darbepoetin alfa , association chemotherapy , could increase CR rate , EFS OS patient treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . This study multicentric , phase III open-label , randomize trial evaluate efficacy safety R-CHOP give every 14 day compare R-CHOP give every 21 day association darbepoetin alfa order maintain hemoglobin 13 g/dl , compare classical symptomatic treatment anemia patient age 66 80 year previously treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma least one adverse prognostic factor age adjust IPI .</detailed_description>
