	<detailed_description>The ovary adrenal gland contribute daily production 300 microgram testosterone healthy , menstruating woman . The physiologic role testosterone woman , however , remain poorly understood . Previous study testosterone supplementation , largely surgically naturally menopausal woman , report improvement subjective measure sexual function , sense well , variable change marker bone formation resorption . However , many previous study use supraphysiologic dos testosterone , insensitive assay measurement total free testosterone level lack precision accuracy low range prevalent woman . The effect testosterone woman body composition , muscle performance physical function study . Therefore , clinical significance androgen deficiency woman remain unclear . Thus , know whether physiologic testosterone replacement woman androgen deficiency produce clinically meaningful improvement sexual cognitive function , fat-free mass , muscle performance , without virilize side effect . Women hypopituitarism represent excellent model study effect physiologic replacement patient severely diminished androgen production adrenal gland ovary . Estrogen administration , increase sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) woman lead reduction free testosterone concentration . In fact , recent study demonstrate low level total free testosterone , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( DHEAS ) , parent steroid dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , androstenedione woman hypopituitarism . Therefore , postulate many woman hypopituitarism suffer decrease libido , alter body composition , impaired quality life , symptom possibly relate androgen deficiency . However , parameter properly study well-defined group woman hypopituitarism . These baseline study need prior undertake study treat woman hypopituitarism testosterone preparation . Prior investigate testosterone replacement large study woman hypopituitarism , must first determine pilot study amount interval testosterone administration . Currently , FDA-approved drug testosterone woman Estratest , contain methyl testosterone , compound give orally associate liver toxicity animal human . Until recently , hypogonadal men receive biweekly intramuscular injection testosterone . This regimen give variable serum testosterone level depend time blood sample compare time injection . Many male hypogonadal patient receive testosterone replacement via either transdermal testosterone gel patch , much uniform serum testosterone level . We choose transdermal testosterone gel use study several reason : 1 . Recent study show stable , reproducible level serum testosterone obtain irrespective application site hypogonadal men . No skin irritation ( problematic testosterone patch ) observe . 2 . Graded Double-blinded dose easily implement . Thus , use transdermal testosterone gel provide predictable physiologic level testosterone .</detailed_description>
