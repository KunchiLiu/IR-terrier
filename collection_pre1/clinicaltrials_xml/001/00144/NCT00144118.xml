	<detailed_description>Study Protocol Post-Operative Creatinine Changes In Patients With Pre-Existing Renal Impairment After Low-Flow Isoflurane Or Sevoflurane : A Randomised Clinical Trial Introduction Sevoflurane volatile anaesthetic agent available clinical use country include Australia , United States , United Kingdom , Canada . Since first clinical use sevoflurane Japan 1980s , million anaesthetic give sevoflurane . Sevoflurane number advantage agent general anaesthesia , particularly isoflurane . The benefit patient environment include : - A low blood tissue solubility allow patient wake fast anaesthesia 1 , 2 . - The low blood solubility allow fast titration surgery . - Heart rate stable increase inspired concentration . - Airway resistance lower volatile agent . - A pleasant smell allow gas induction - There less nausea vomit isoflurane - It fluorocarbon rather chlorofluorocarbon worsen atmospheric ozone hole . The important concern sevoflurane effect renal function due breakdown product . When sevoflurane expose carbon dioxide absorbents soda lime baralyme vinyl breakdown product call Compound-A formed . High dose exposure Compound-A alters kidney histology rat . Some , , study find Compound-A produce increase urinary secretion renal tubule enzyme human . The clinical importance enzyme secretion unclear . The widely use indicator renal function establish clinical importance plasma creatinine concentration . No study sevoflurane show sevoflurane produce great increase plasma creatinine concentration anaesthetic drug . The Austin Health Department Anaesthesia recently complete study cardiac anaesthesia include sevoflurane . We find , compare isoflurane , sevoflurane , propofol , difference creatinine change surgery three group . This study publish Anesthesiology , manuscript attach . The fresh gas flow anaesthetic machine amount oxygen , oxygen air , oxygen nitrous oxide flow anaesthetic circuit per minute . Moderate fresh gas flow around 3 l/min . Low fresh gas flow around 1 l/min . Low fresh gas flow benefit patient , environment , hospital : - Patients lose less heat - Patients lose less water - There less environmental contamination chlorofluorocarbon nitrous oxide ( green house gas ) . - Lower anaesthetic cost . At low fresh gas flow , patient expose high concentration Compound A . A recent multicentre study look creatinine change major surgery . This study find difference isoflurane sevoflurane low fresh gas flow 1 l/min . Patients pre-existing renal impairment exclude . Pre-operative renal impairment increase risk clinically important deterioration renal function surgery . Studies change creatinine sevoflurane include small number patient pre-existing renal impairment 10 . None small study show sevoflurane aggravates pre-existing renal impairment anaesthetic drug . This include subgroup analysis Cardiac Anaesthesia study . No study , however , examine creatinine change pre-existing renal impairment low fresh gas flow . This would expose increase risk renal impairment great dose Compound-A . From research , believe sevoflurane would affect renal function isoflurane patient preexist renal impairment receive low flow anesthesia . Research Question What post operative change serum creatinine anaesthesia sevoflurane isoflurane use fresh gas flow 1 l/min patient pre-operative renal impairment ? Methods The study method draw heavily previous study 7 , copy attach . The study design conforms Consolidated Standard Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) 11 . Study type Randomized , clinical trial . Study Site Austin Repatriation Medical Centre Eligible patient Adult patient elective surgery : 1. need stay least one night 2. need general anaesthesia 3. pre-operative serum creatinine concentration great 130 umol/l . Exclusions 1 . The patient refuse . 2 . The patient le 18 year age . 3 . The patient pre-operative dialysis 4 . The anaesthetist plan use regional total intravenous anaesthesia . 5 . Specific type surgery : craniotomy , carotid , cardiac . Recruiting One investigator recruit patient soon possible patient book surgery . We expect enroll least 3 patient per week . Treatment arm 1 . Isoflurane OR 2 . Sevoflurane Anaesthesia maintenance fresh gas flow 1 l/min inspire oxygen 30 % 100 % nitrogen ( oxygen/air ) nitrous oxide . Individual anaesthetist determine aspects peri-operative care include fluid therapy . Random allocation Patients randomly allocate receive isoflurane sevoflurane . Before trial ARMC pharmacy staff provide allocation sequence use table random number . Allocations keep opaque envelope trial coordinator . Anaesthetists notify allocation isoflurane sevoflurane day surgery . Primary end point The primary end point high change serum creatinine operation first three day postoperatively . Supporting data high creatinine urea first three postoperative day . Patients leave hospital 3 postoperative day include . Good clinical care patient renal impairment include creatinine measurement admission least one postoperative creatinine measurement . The trial coordinator oversee . The data study clinically indicated test . Specific blood test study need . Data collect ARMC clinical chemistry result . Data store computer secure ARMC Department Anaesthesia line Therapeutic Goods Administration Guidelines Good Clinical Research Practice Australia . Clinically important change When analyse difference isoflurane sevoflurane group , two criterion need meet change creatinine clinically important : 1. least one mean increase creatinine great 45 umol/l pre-operative concentration AND 2. difference mean great 20 umol/l . For example : The group 1 mean rise 50 umol/l group 2 mean rise 25 umol/l . Power analysis Using standard deviation 50 umol/l Cardiac Anaesthesia trial data , power 0.90 , alpha &lt; 0.05 , detect 20 umol/l difference 2 group would need 270 patient . We estimate would need two year complete study . Data Collection Statistical analysis Data collect analysed investigator blind drug allocation . Statistical analysis parametric test data normally distribute . Otherwise equivalent non-parametric test use . The statistic point estimate difference isoflurane sevoflurane increase creatinine , 95 % confidence interval point estimate , p value unpaired Student ’ t-test . An additional analysis estimate proportion patient isoflurane sevoflurane group postoperative creatinine change great 45 umol/l . The statistic point estimate difference proportion , 95 % confidence interval point estimate , p value Chi square test . Supporting statistic point estimate difference peak creatinine urea , 95 % confidence interval point estimate , p value unpaired Student ’ t-tests . Adverse event . In addition usual clinical care , patient study add surveillance clinical chemistry result . Important change pass surgical unit care patient . The investigator notify ARMC Human Research Ethics Committee death serious morbidity patient enrol study . Significance project For large trial , simple design , hypothesis sevoflurane produce great increase creatinine isoflurane patient preexist renal impairment . For project unequivocal finding would 95 % confidence interval difference isoflurane sevoflurane group include clinically important difference difference find p value great 0.05 . Unequivocal finding would lead u two conclusion : ( 1 ) highly unlikely sevoflurane clinically important adverse renal effect , ( 2 ) sevoflurane safe use low fresh gas flow patient preexist renal impairment . The benefit sevoflurane low fresh gas flow discuss introduction . A finding adverse renal effect would provide high quality evidence support safety use sevoflurane low fresh gas flow patient preexist renal impairment .</detailed_description>
