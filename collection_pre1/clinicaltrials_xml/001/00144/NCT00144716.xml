	<brief_title>Evaluation Combined Use ITN 's Insect Repellents Against Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little doubt use insecticide treat bed net ( ITN 's ) one successful mean reduce malaria Africa . However , vector region tend late night , indoor feeder . Vector specie part world may susceptible form vector control . In much Central &amp; Southern America , major vector An . darlingi An . albitarsis feed peak 8 - 10pm , people retire bed . Similarly , major vector much S.E . Asia , An . dirus , seldom enters home fee . In circumstance unlikely ITN 's alone provide adequate protection . Supplemental use skin apply insect repellent may effective method personal protection hour dusk retire bed . It would also prove useful individual work late move early forest exophagic specie encounter . As yet , robust clinical evaluation combine ITN repellent use . This double blind , placebo-controlled study design evaluate efficacy combine ITN plant base insect repellent use reduce P. falciparum Bolivian Amazon region ITN 's alone likely ineffective . The study double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical evaluation . 1000 household use 5 individual age 10 + enter study . Recruitment cover rural community Vaca Diez Pando Provinces , Department Beni Bolivian Amazon Region , plus outer 10 % periurban district 2 major town region , Riberalta Guayaramerin . A maximum 20 % household one location use , thus avoid effect diversion insect treatment placebo home . Likewise , house use minimum 25m study . Baseline survey conduct individual informed write consent collect . Treatment ( 30 % L.E . ) / placebo ( 0.1 % clove oil alcohol ) mark A B allocate ( 50:50 ) random , individual group provide ITN . Compliance questionnaire , collection old bottle distribution fresh bottle conduct every 4 week . Everyone receive personal instruction apply repellent arm &amp; leg even dusk leave pictorial instruction sheet measure 10 ml use bottle lid . Compliance threshold set 10 % monitor measure residual product collection record nightly use . A realistic measure compliance gain occasional evening spot check household local health worker . Finger prick blood sample collect baseline monthly throughout study train &amp; approve field staff . P. falciparum infection diagnose Paracheck® dipstick test , thus overcome problem recrudescence P. vivax . Positive case refer local health centre treatment . The timing visit mean majority malaria episode detect Paracheck® test detect antibody blood around 3 week post treatment . In addition use monthly questionnaire , episode miss highly likely record , employ local health worker area , blood slide routinely take local health centre . Outcome determination constitute series monthly cross-sectional prevalence survey , , positive case treat , equivalent measure average prevalence infection house .</detailed_description>
