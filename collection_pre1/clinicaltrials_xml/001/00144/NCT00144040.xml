	<brief_summary>Purpose The emergence rapid rise antibiotic resistance among common bacteria adversely affect clinical course health care cost community-acquired infection . Because antibiotic resistance rate strongly correlate antibiotic use pattern , multiple organization declare reduction unnecessary antibiotic use critical component effort combat antibiotic resistance . Among human , vast majority unnecessary antibiotic prescription use treat acute respiratory tract infection ( ARIs ) viral etiology . Although rate antibiotic prescribe ARIs office-based physician US decrease 16 % peak 1997 , rate antibiotic prescribing acute care setting ( eg , emergency department urgent care center ) , account 1 5 ambulatory antibiotic prescription US , show modest decline ( 6 % ) period . Translation lesson intervention study office-based practice need improve antibiotic use acute care setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate impact multidimensional ( patient , system , clinician ) intervention appropriate antibiotic use adult acute respiratory tract infection -- identify factor influence successful translation across VA hospital non-VA hospital acute care . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate impact rapid diagnostic test c-reactive protein antibiotic use adult acute cough illness add multidimensional intervention . Methods : We propose conduct randomize controlled trial quality improvement program consist physician education ( educational seminar , practice guideline , performance feedback , decision support tool ) patient education ( wait room print audiovisual material ) 8 VA hospital 8 non-VA hospital emergency department . Non VA study site identify exist research network hospital emergency department -- EDNet . VA hospital site select among academically affiliate hub facility . Phase one involve hospital-level randomize trial multidimensional intervention translate exist evidence base guideline antibiotic use ARIs vs. usual care . Simultaneously , validate new CRP-based diagnostic algorithm incorporate evidence base guideline antibiotic use ARIs . Phase two involve second hospital-level randomize trial new antibiotic use guideline incorporate CRP-based diagnostic algorithm vs. original guideline . Specific endpoint include overall success intervention phase term reduce antibiotic prescribing ARIs , improve patient outcome reduce resource utilization . In addition examin impact VA non-VA organizational factor successful translation various component intervention phase . Data collect use exist administrative data well on-site enrollment subject prospective follow-up study .</detailed_description>
