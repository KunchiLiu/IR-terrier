	<detailed_description>In past 4 year investigator ' research group complete 2 study effect testosterone therapy exercise induce coronary ischaemia ( clinically manifest angina pectoris ) . We , investigator Sheffield Teaching Hospitals , show testosterone replacement therapy improve exercise duration treadmill prolong time ischaemia ( ischaemic threshold ) . Moreover , demonstrate dose response relationship increase exercise duration baseline testosterone level men low baseline testosterone level derive great symptomatic benefit replacement therapy . Importantly also demonstrate effect testosterone maintain presence concomitant anti-anginal drug therapy physiological level testosterone therapy . ( English et al . 2000 ; Malkin 2004 ) Furthermore find prevalence men coronary disease low serum testosterone level approximately 25 % . This represent large population men low testosterone level may benefit symptomatically testosterone therapy . These men qualify androgen replacement therapy per se simply relieve hypogonadal symptom maintain bone mineral density clinical guideline recommend physiological testosterone replacement cohort . ( Morales Lunenfeld 2002 ) The safety issue relate testosterone treatment comprise theoretical increase risk prostate neoplasia increase erythropoiesis limited relevance population replacement therapy return testosterone level physiological range . Indeed , evidence appropriate testosterone therapy increase risk prostate cancer . More importantly , prostate cancer identify early screening prostate specific antigen allow careful surveillance replacement therapy . This study aim address following question effect testosterone therapy men coronary ischaemia : - Does anti-anginal effect persist long term ? Many publish study acute single dose trial none chronic study assess patient formally beyond month . Our early study limit 3 month . - Does testosterone therapy men affect level measurable atheroma ? There currently in-vivo human evidence androgen therapy inhibits reduces level atheroma , although abundant evidence animal suggest potential improvement . This study address two issue would one-year duration would longest trial testosterone therapy men cardiovascular disease . The primary endpoint change time ST- segment depression &gt; 1mm exercise testing .</detailed_description>
