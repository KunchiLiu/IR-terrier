	<brief_summary>This phase III clinical trial patient potentially completely resectable primary retroperitoneal sarcoma . Patients take part divide two group , radiation therapy plus surgery group surgery alone group . Patients radiation therapy plus surgery group receive radiation treatment outpatient . Surgery try remove remain tumor do radiation treatment complete . Patients surgery alone group surgery try remove tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Trial Pre-Operative IMRT+Surgery Versus Surgery Alone For Primary Retroperitoneal Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To ascertain whether patient completely resect ( R0 + R1 ) , primary retroperitoneal sarcoma randomize pre-operative IMRT surgery longer recurrence-free survival compare patient randomize treatment surgery alone . Secondary Objectives : To ascertain whether patient completely resect ( R0 + R1 ) , primary retroperitoneal sarcoma randomize pre-operative IMRT surgery longer overall survival compare patient randomize treatment surgery alone . - To compare resectability rate two arm - Determine variability NMR biochemical profile variability expression genes/proteins involve adipocyte differentiation , cell cycle control apoptosis within different region primary retroperitoneal sarcoma patient treat surgery alone pre-operative radiotherapy . - Analyze NMR biochemical pattern expression pattern genes/proteins involved adipocyte differentiation , cell cycle control apoptosis identify marker provide objective measure sarcoma differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis . - Predict response sarcoma radiation therapy risk local recurrence , base data derive NMR biochemical gene/protein expression pattern patient tumor recur compare without recurrence . - Determine diffusion-weighted MRI early course radiation therapy predict ultimate pathologic response sarcoma follow resection risk local recurrence . - Analyze plasma level VEGF , FGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 endostatin prior follow therapy correlate treatment response , local distant recurrence .</detailed_description>
