A blood sample collect begin end study measure blood haemoglobin serum ferritin concentration . At enrolment , child 's HIV status screen antibody-ELISA confirm HIV PCR . The impact dietary intervention primarily assess compare weight gain two intervention group . Secondary outcome include length gain , increase tibial length change blood haemoglobin serum ferritin concentration . The study also produce descriptive data morbidity intake food intervention .</detailed_description>
