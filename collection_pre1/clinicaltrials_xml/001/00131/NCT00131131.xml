	<detailed_description>The female gender multiparity two important positive correlate cholesterol gallstone disease . Pregnancy represent period time 'lithogenic ' pressure woman high . Biliary sludge precursor stage gallstone . The investigator study etiological factor associate development sludge stone pregnancy , early result suggest inversely related physical activity . They also find overweight , know risk factor gallstone disease , associate high blood leptin level . In addition , risk associate high leptin level partially mitigate physical activity . In order disentangle effect physical activity , leptin gestational diabetes gallbladder disease risk , understand mechanism behind observed association , investigator propose conduct randomize control trial . This interventional study logical extension previous observational investigation . Their specific aim : - To evaluate whether endurance exercise program associate low risk gallbladder disease overweight pregnant woman ; - To evaluate whether endurance exercise intervention program change leptin level pregnancy among overweight woman ; - To examine association gallbladder disease incidence potential causal variable prospective trial . These variable include leptin level , HDL , insulin level , BMI ( varies within woman classify overweight ) , well change variable . Gallstone disease affect 15-20 % adult Americans . Cholecystectomy one commonly perform operation . The morbidity , burden cost , incur gallstone stagger . Yet dearth understanding epidemiology cause disease . The result investigation generate new , important useful insight pathogenesis , provide rational strategy prevention , common costly disease .</detailed_description>
