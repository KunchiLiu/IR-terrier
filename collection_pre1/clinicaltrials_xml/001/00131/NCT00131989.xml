	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( ) ( DLTs ) maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) BAY 43-9006 give orally . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary evidence tumor response BAY 43-9006 patient . II . To assess pharmacokinetic profile BAY 43-9006 . III . To characterize preliminary profile adverse event change laboratory parameter patient treat BAY 43-9006 . IV . To assess effect BAY 43-9006 various cellular property leukemic blast expose drug vivo vitro . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-14 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) may consider retreatment sorafenib additional 6 course upon disease recurrence provide duration CR longer 1 month . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos sorafenib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . A total 12 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year .</detailed_description>
