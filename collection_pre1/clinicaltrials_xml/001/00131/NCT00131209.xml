	<detailed_description>Childhood undernutrition common rural Malawi , like many country Sub-Saharan Africa . Usually , undernutrition develop 6 24 month age . By two year age , 30-50 % child rural Malawi undernourish , predispose subsequent morbidity , developmental delay mortality . Urgent intervention need magnitude problem preclude hospital-based management strategy . Therefore , emphasis must prevention early home-based rehabilitation child mild-to-moderate malnutrition . However , option community base approach develop institutional management undernutrition . The present study test recently develop nutrient -dense spread , ready-to use- therapeutic food ( RUTF ) , offer potential solution home base nutrition rehabilitation . The concept previously show work therapeutic feeding undernourished child nutrition rehabilitation unit Malawi also home base supplementation undernourished child Mangochi District , southern Malawi . In present study investigator test efficacy growth promotion health benefit product provide complementary food infant 6 18 month age . The study conduct Lungwena area , Mangochi District , rural Malawi . A total 180 6-month old infant enrol randomised three group receive different daily food supplement 12 month . Children group-one ( control group ) receive 75g maize/soy flour daily . Children group-two receive 25g RUTF daily child group-three receive 50g RUTF daily period 12 month . The food supplement deliver participant 's home weekly interval . All child undergo medical anthropometric examination 4-monthly interval disease symptom monitor every week . Dietary intake assessment conduct 12 15 month age . A random sample 36 child undergo breast milk intake assessment start food supplementation food supplementation . A blood sample collect begin end study measure blood haemoglobin serum ferritin concentration test human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] ( 6 18 month ) . The impact dietary intervention primarily assess compare weight gain three intervention group . Secondary outcome include length gain , incidence moderate underweight , stunt wasting , cognitive motor development end trial change blood haemoglobin serum ferritin concentration . The study also produce descriptive data morbidity intake breast milk food intervention .</detailed_description>
