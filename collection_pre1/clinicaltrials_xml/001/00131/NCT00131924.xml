	<brief_title>High-Dose Esterified Estrogens Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Failed Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response rate postmenopausal woman estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer fail prior sequential endocrine therapy treat high-dose esterified estrogen ( Menest^® ) . Secondary - Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral high-dose esterify estrogen ( Menest^® ) 3 time daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-35 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
