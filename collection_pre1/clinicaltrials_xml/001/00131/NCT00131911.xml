	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective tumor response rate BAY 43-9006 ( sorafenib tosylate ) patient advanced neuroendocrine tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Adverse event rate ( ) . II . Progression free survival time progression . III . Improvement circulate hormone level . IV . Overall survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients group 2 separate analysis Groups accord tumor type ( Group A : Carcinoid ; Group B : Islet cell/other well-differentiated tumor ) . Each Group independently evaluate study endpoint . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 2 year study entry .</detailed_description>
