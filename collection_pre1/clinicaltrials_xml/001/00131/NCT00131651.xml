	<brief_title>ATN-161 Advanced Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis , define growth new blood vessel pre-existing vessel , requirement growth nearly tumor . Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( CCRCC ) malignancy characterize abundant vascularization high degree resistance chemotherapy make antiangiogenic therapy intrigue concept treatment . This concept establish initial success observe recent study antiangiogenic therapy CCRCC . ATN-161 attractive candidate investigation therapeutic agent CCRCC bind several fully activate integrins , essential downstream component angiogenic signal cascade . Functional image use dceMRI demonstrate effective way show effect vasculature across different tumor , include CCRCC . Preclinical experiment show ATN-161 affect tumor perfusion tumor bearing mouse . Therefore , use imaging study expect effective method evaluate antiangiogenic response ATN-161 . Patients administer ATN-161 three time weekly short ( 10 minute ) IV infusion 1 3 dose level ( 20 , 100 , 600 mg ) . Patients treated progression disease , unacceptable drug toxicity , withdrawal consent occur . Functional imaging ( dceMRI ) perform within 1 week prior first treatment , second week treatment , finally fourth week treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must unresectable and/or metastatic kidney cancer component clear cell adenocarcinoma histologically confirm . A pathologist investigator 's institution must review material sent outside institution confirm diagnosis . 2 . Patients must previously treat least one FDAapproved therapy commonly use treatment ( interferon low dose interleukin2 ) advance kidney cancer . Any number prior treatment , approve investigational , acceptable . 3 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique 2 time measurable slice width spiral CT scan . See RECIST Appendix B evaluation measurable disease . 4 . Patients must least one lesion amenable dceMRI per lesion guideline ( see Section 8.1.1 ) . 5 . Age ≥18 year . 6 . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( see Appendix A ) . 7 . Patients must recover reversible effect prior treatment ( exception alopecia ) return normal mild severity ( Grade 1 ) pretreatment baseline . 8 . Life expectancy great three month . 9 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500 cells/mm3 platelet ≥100,000 cells/mm3 total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤2.5 x ULN patient liver metastasis ) alkaline phosphatase ≤5.0 x ULN serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN serum calcium ≤1 x ULN ( patient may treatment hypercalcemia ) 10 . The effect ATN 161 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason antiangiogenic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal and/or barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation follow visit 28 day last dose ATN 161 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Similarly , partner male patient become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 11 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients recover reversible adverse event due previouslyadministered agent . 2 . Patients may receive agent , approve investigational , treatment CCRCC , may receive investigational agent condition . 3 . Patients document brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Institutional practice follow establish absence brain metastasis . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Pregnant woman exclude study ATN 161 antiangiogenic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ATN 161 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ATN 161 . 6 . Patients know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive exclude . 7 . Patients undergo dceMRI analysis reason . 8 . Patients adequate wound heal base clinical judgment follow major surgical intervention .</criteria>
