	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Nipent , Cytoxan Rituxan Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) common form adult leukemia U.S . Recent experience Nipent conjunction Rituxan show combination well tolerate clinically promise . It expect addition Cytoxan patient previously untreated CLL patient relapse failed prior therapy may benefit combined therapy use Nipent , Cytoxan Rituxan . It unknown addition Cytoxan affect toxicity profile Rituxan Nipent regimen , however , patient monitor toxicity . It expect bone marrow toxicity increase unreasonable level . The primary objective study determine overall efficacy response rate follow treatment Nipent , Cytoxan Rituxan patient previously untreated treated CLL . The secondary objective study determine duration response , time progression , time treatment failure evaluate toxicity combination drug incidence severity adverse event .</detailed_description>
