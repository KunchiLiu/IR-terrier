	<detailed_description>Background General : Uterine leiomyoma ( fibroid ) common neoplasms female pelvis . These benign tumor generally oval shape , often highly vascular . On T2 weight MR image exam , T1 exams contrast , uterine fibroid easily identifiable . They occur 20-25 % woman reproductive age cause variety problem generally describe either bleed mass effect fibroid . In general , symptom classify two category : 1. heavy menstrual bleeding , define bleed heavy day require change sanitary wear every 2 hour less , significant clot passage , flooding , substantial prolongation menstrual period compare patient 's prior experience , anemia . 2. pelvic pain pressure , heaviness discomfort , similar symptom back , flank leg attributable bulk fibroid , urinary frequency , increase nocturia , difficulty void compression ureter hydronephrosis . Measures clinical success patient elect treatment fibroid generally subjective , evaluated patient term improvement initial symptom cause seek treatment ( decrease pain , bladder bowel symptom , reduction vaginal bleeding ) , experience minimum co-morbidities treatment . ExAblate Device : The InSightec ExAblate MR guide Focused Ultrasound Surgery ( MRgFUS ) system non-invasive thermal ablation device fully integrated MR imaging system use ablation soft tissue . It evaluate earlier FDA international , multi-center study find safe effective treatment uterine fibroid . ExAblate device receive FDA approval October 2004 . Prior Studies : The ExAblate use treatment uterine fibroid 2 previous IDE protocol . - Group A : This original Pivotal Study Group ( IDE G020001 - Protocol UF002 ) . These 109 patient treat 3 site US 4 site outside US . There limitation allowable treatment volume single treatment permit . Original follow-up plan 6 month . The study later extend include follow-up visit 12 , 24 , 36 month ( UF009 ) . Because gap initial study consent , re-consent long term follow-up high dropout rate 12 month visit . Thirty-three US patient return 12 month visit , continue follow 24 36 M visit . - Group B : This Continued Access Study ( IDE G020001 - Protocol UF005 ) approximately 160 patient treat 3 site US PMA review period . Treatment condition modify somewhat pivotal , include addition second treatment session necessary . The initial study plan include long term follow-up 12 , 24 36 month ( UF009 ) . - Group C : This group 70 patient ( UF14 ) treat post-PMA approval follow commercial treatment guideline . The follow-up include visit 12 , 24 36 month . This group include also another 20 patient treat original IDE validate ExAblate system use 3T MR scanner , well validate new application SW ( V4.1 ) .</detailed_description>
