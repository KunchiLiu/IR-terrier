	<detailed_description>More general practitioner ( GPs ) use spirometry practice . At time , sufficient reason presume , single postgraduate training program without support , GPs insufficient knowledge ability assure valid interpretation spirometry test . Therefore , kind continuous diagnostic support regard spirometry interpretation GPs advisable . The problem formulation study propose : `` Does implementation spirometry expert support ( either computerize expert system local work agreement GPs respiratory consultant respect spirometry interpretation ) cause change diagnose quality efficiency medical care subject chronic respiratory morbidity manage general practice ? ” . In order address issue , two separate study different design propose . Study I ( n=62 GPs ) ‘ in-depth ’ study GPs ‘ decision-making process regard spirometry , impact computerize expert system process . Study II ( n=39 general practice ) pragmatic randomised-controlled implementation study evaluate two realistic mode spirometry expert support ( i.e. , computerize expert system work agreement GPs respiratory consultant ) .</detailed_description>
