	<brief_summary>Malaria pregnancy potentially fatal mother foetus particularly primigravidae . Implementation appropriate control preventive measure challenge fact malaria infection pregnancy often asymptomatic parasitized red blood cell sequestrate placental microcirculation may detectable peripheral blood . In addition , widespread prevalence parasite resistant chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) , safety concern new antimalarial , poverty inadequate supply make antimalarial treatment option available pregnant woman limit . These necessitated urgent search alternative safe efficacious treatment option pregnant woman . The objective study ass efficacy , safety tolerability four antimalarial treatment option rural Ghana within programme setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To determine effect AQ , SP AQ+SP combination compare CQ treatment prevalence peripheral parasitaemia day 14 28 post treatment . Secondary objective : 1 . To compare incidence adverse event treatment group . 2 . To compare effect study drug maternal haemoglobin 14 28 day post treatment , delivery . 3 . To compare effect study drug peripheral placental parasite density delivery . 4 . To compare effect study drug birth weight delivery . 5 . To assess effect modification gestational age , parity , gravidity , prior antimalarial use , presence absence symptom enrolment , baseline parasite density baseline Hb parasitological haematological response test drug . 6 . To assess accuracy OptiMAL antigen test detect peripheral parasitaemia compare microscopy . 7 . To compare overall incidence adverse pregnancy outcome ( abortion , stillbirth , congenital abnormality , prematurity intrauterine death ) study group local rate obtain St Theresa 's Hospital 's record . Study location population : The study carry St. Theresa 's Hospital Nkoranza district Brong Ahafo Region Ghana . The St. Theresa 's hospital general district hospital . It bed capacity 80 provide basic medical service include adult medicine , paediatrics , surgery obstetrics gynaecology . The study enrol pregnant woman parity attend St. Theresa 's Hospital 's antenatal clinic gestational age 16 week March 2003 September 2004 . Methods : Antennal screen enrolment : All pregnant woman attend antenatal clinic screen malaria antigen OptiMAL dipstick . Those positive antigen test consider eligible , informed consent obtain 5mls venous blood drawn antecubital vein baseline measurement haemoglobin , white blood cell count ( total differential ) , bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase gamma-glutamyl transferase making filter paper blood spot . Women assess clinically obstetrically view enrol study . Pregnancy viability gestational age confirm ultrasound scanning study clinician principal investigator . Pregnant woman positive malaria antigen test confirm microscopically randomise four treatment arm satisfy inclusion criterion . Follow-up schedule : Field worker visit study woman home follow initial supervise drug administration antenatal clinic post treatment day 3 , 7 , 14 28 perform follow routine . - Day 3 Day 7 : Obtained venous blood filter paper blood spot , white cell malaria parasite count , record side effect . - Day 14 Day 28 : Obtained venous blood white cell malaria parasite count , measurement alanine aspartate transaminase , bilirubin filter paper blood spot record side effect . Subsequently , pregnant woman see antenatal clinic monthly , 32 week gestation fortnightly . At visit , actively screen peripheral parasitaemia use OptiMAL dipstick test . At time delivery test negative , woman remain daily haematinic . If woman already enrol positive antigen test confirm microscopy , receive another course treatment initially assign . Women enrol study first episode malaria detect antenatal visit . At delivery , midwife record birth weight stillbirth , perinatal death congenital abnormality . They also make slide peripheral , placental cord blood sample maternal blood haemoglobin measurement . Any record congenital deformity verify confirmed clinician . The woman baby visit home six week post delivery record neonatal adverse event death severe morbidity . Outcome measure : Primary 1 . Prevalence parasitaemia day 14 28 post treatment . Secondary 1 . Incidence adverse drug event within seven day follow treatment . 2 . Proportions pregnant woman withdrawn study due occurrence adverse drug event ( clinical laboratory ) day 7 follow initiation treatment . 3 . Change maternal haemoglobin concentration day 14 28 follow treatment . 4 . Prevalence peripheral parasitaemia delivery . 5 . Prevalence placental parasitaemia delivery . 6 . Proportions abnormal biochemistry white blood cell value day 14 28 post treatment . 7 . Sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , likelihood ratio , area receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve OptiMAL antigen test . 8 . Incidences adverse pregnancy outcome study group . 9 . Prevalence postpartum parasitaemia . 10 . Prevalence postpartum anaemia . Sample Size : This base assumption 28-day parasitological clearance 90 % AQ , SP AQ+SP combination , 78 % chloroquine ( Î± = 5 % power = 90 % ) . Allowing 15 % loss follow-up , 225 pregnant woman recruit 4 treatment arm study give total study size 900 pregnant woman . Data safety monitor board : A data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) constitute project . The board responsible : - Regular monitoring data safety issue concern study . - Reviewing PI 's report serious adverse event make recommendation progress study . - Reviewing statistical analysis plan prior break study drug code .</detailed_description>
