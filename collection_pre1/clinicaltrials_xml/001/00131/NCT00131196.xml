	<brief_summary>The proposal aim identifying genetic factor determine incidence severity , outcome life−threatening infection ( severe sepsis/septic shock ) patient admit High Dependency Units ( HDUs ) Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) pneumonia develop outside hospital ( community acquire pneumonia − CAP ) contamination abdominal cavity faeces due leak bowel ( faecal peritonitis ) . This require acquisition large , high quality resource genetic material ( DNA ) , plasma , urine , white blood cell clinical information well characterize group similar patient , risk , severe sepsis/septic shock . The principal objective perform study sufficiently large establish beyond doubt influence series select `` candidate '' gene development , progress outcome sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit 2,000 case community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) 2,000 case faecal peritonitis ( FP ) 30 UK ICUs HDUs ( member UK Critical Care Genomics group − UKCCG ) . The large number patient require satisfy power calculation base upon predict allele frequency candidate gene level functional expression gene polymorphism . If patient eligible , write , informed consent obtain either patient , patient incompetent via patient 's legal representative . Patients characterize clinically term admission diagnosis , severity illness ( APACHE II ) , organ failure ( SOFA ) final outcome ( ICU hospital mortality , death survival 6 month follow ICU admission . Date death record appropriate ) . Clinical status assess daily day 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 7 ICU admission use Sepsis criterion , SOFA score , microbiological culture result antibiotic therapy . Selected ICUs , follow consent , also undertake blood urine sampling day 1 , 3 5 genomic , proteomic metabolomic study . Information record bar−coded paper clinical report form ( CRF ) bedside . The CRFs securely store locally copy research coordinator , archive . The data enter independently research coordinator one investigator secure , central web−based electronic database storage clinical data calculation derive value . The patient cod genetic analysis derive directly clinical database . Those undertake genotyping blinded clinical detail two database bring together time analysis direct supervision one principal investigator .</detailed_description>
