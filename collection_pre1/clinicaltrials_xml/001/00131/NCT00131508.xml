	<brief_summary>Children sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) seem high energy need child disease . This may reason child teenager sickle cell anemia tend small , weigh less , less fat muscle child teens disease . This study do find give supplement call glutamine help child sickle cell anemia lower energy need improve growth strength . Children randomly assign ( like flip coin ) one two group . One group take glutamine one group take placebo ( protein mixture look like glutamine may effect body ) . No one know group take supplement study complete . Children study 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . The study compare effect glutamine placebo rest energy expenditure ( REE ) child sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) compare change REE ratio baseline 12 month . 2 . The study investigate effect oral glutamine placebo body composition child SCA compare difference body mass index ( BMIs ) percent body fat ( DEXA Scan ) baseline 12 month treatment two group . 3 . This Study investigate effect oral glutamine placebo growth child SCA compare Z score one year baseline 1 year study . 4 . This study investigate effect oral glutamine placebo child SCA compare difference level plasma red blood cell glutamine baseline 12 month treatment two group . 5 . This study investigate clinical effect ( strength exercise endurance ) oral glutamine placebo child SCA compare difference baseline 12 month treatment two group . 6 . This study evaluate quality life child SCA glutamine placebo 12 month . 7 . This study evaluate change REE time small group patient REE measurement month 3 , 6 , 9 . This objective offered patient , `` additional study '' require participate protocol .</detailed_description>
