	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate treatment sorafenib ( BAY43-9006 ) patient recurrent aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate duration response progression free survival treatment BAY43-9006 patient recurrent aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas . II . To characterize toxicity treatment BAY43-9006 patient recurrent aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics property BAY43-9006 ass influence monooxygenases polymorphisms multi-drug resistance transporter ( MDR ) pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PLANNED ACCRUAL : 41 ACTUAL ACCRUAL : 14</detailed_description>
