	<brief_summary>This study use autologous ( one 's ) CD4 T cell modify viral vector express genetic antisense target HIV , vector call VRX496 . Study treatment intravenous infusion vector modify cell infusion provide every week total 4 8 dos . These modified cell , infuse , may provide immune support destroy HIV , thus may delay reverse HIV disease progression . The study enroll 40 male female HIV-positive subject 8 center . Subjects 18 year age fail intolerant least one triple combination antiretroviral drug . Subjects must viral load 5,000 200,000 copies/ml CD4+ count ≥150 , good health evidence active opportunistic infection , heart disease , bleed disorder . Subjects must corticosteroids , immunomodulating agent hydroxyurea . Subjects must receive AIDS vaccine investigational gene therapy product time . Females must pregnant breastfeeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VIRxSYS conclude 6-month Phase 1/2 clinical study IND vector VRX496 HIV-positive subject fail least two HAART regimen . HAART typically consist triple `` cocktail '' drug . Although cocktail successful reduce viral load restore immune function , represent cure . There also concern adverse effect associate long-term usage HAART . Specifically , variety metabolic disorder include HIV-associated lipodystrophy , central adiposity , dyslipidaemia , hyperlipidaemia , hyperglycemia , insulin resistance report result HAART . These reaction , combine often complex cumbersome dosing regimen , adverse effect patient-subject adherence therapy . Furthermore , poor adherence lead increase rate HIV resistance , result viral strain reduce sensitivity drug . Importantly , Phase 1/2 clinical trial conduct VIRxSYS , report toxicity associate product . Gene therapy HIV-1 infection propose alternative antiretroviral drug regimen . A number different genetic vector antiviral payload utilized combat HIV-1 , include antisense RNA , transdominant protein , ribozymes , RNA decoy , single chain antibody , RNAi ( RNA-interference . Antisense RNA target wt-HIV RNA offer significant advantage several genetic antiviral approach protein thus immunogenic size payload prevents virus escape mutant , occurs use RNAi . In Phase 2 protocol , 6 subject stagger infusion least 2 week . The first group 3 subject receive 4 infusion ( 4-dose cohort ) . If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe , second group 3 subject , ( i.e . subject 4 , 5 6 ) continue 8 infusion ( 8-dose cohort ) . Safety visit schedule 1 week infusion monthly first 6 month 9 month follow last infusion . After safety evaluate , order explore biological activity , additional subject ( 6-10 evaluable subject ) enter cohort . Follow-up visit schedule 1 week infusion monthly first 6 month 9 month follow last infusion . The effect single bolus also examine third cohort . The single bolus infusion consist follow cell dos : approximately 10 billion , 20 billion , 30 billion , respectively . Subjects allot respective cell dose group accord order enrol . Three 5 subject allot low cell dose group follow safety 4 week . After safety evaluate , next group ( 3 5 subject ) allot next high cell dose group follow safety 4 week . If intermediate cell dose group determine safe , additional 3 5 subject allot high cell dose group . All subject follow safety biweekly interval first 4 week thereafter monthly interval 6 month 9 month . The study conclude 's 9-month active phase . Subjects currently 15-year Long Term Follow-up Phase study . In keep recently release Guidance Monitoring For Delayed Adverse Events , state first 5 year subject undergo monitoring vector sequence every 6 month , subject visit clinic maximum 6 month interval blood test evaluate persistence vector sequence . Therefore first 5 year , subject 6 month visit safety assessment . For year 6 15 , subject contact phone mail . At contact , subject ask health status .</detailed_description>
