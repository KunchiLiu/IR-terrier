	<detailed_description>Background Studies undertake Guinea Bissau show protective effect BCG vaccine death young child great would expect effect prevent tuberculosis . How might achieve know BCG could act enhance immune response common infection include malaria important cause death young child Bissau . There laboratory evidence support hypothesis . BCG prevent malaria rodent , probably activate reticulo-endothelial system Freund 's adjuvant , emulsion tubercle bacillus oil , prevents malaria primate . In develop country , BCG give soon possible birth integral part immunisation programme control trial withheld neonatal BCG vaccination would ethical . However , uncertain long non-specific protective effect BCG persist whether could sustain injection BCG second year life . A major trial investigate possibility way Guinea Bissau mortality main end-point . The current study make use opportunity investigate whether re-vaccination BCG protective effect malaria . Objective The primary objective study determine re-vaccination BCG reduce morbidity malaria young child . Study area The study carry within area cover Bandim Health Project Bissau , capital Guinea Bissau , West Africa . The study area , within suburbs Bissau , population approximately 70,000 demographic surveillance . Routine infant immunisation give 3 health center area ; baby deliver national hospital give BCG leave . Overall coverage BCG high ( &gt; 95 % ) . Study population All infants resident study area eligible inclusion main BCG re-vaccination trial . Children recruit malaria sub-study period January October 2003 age 19 month due receive BCG re-vaccination remain control . Separate , write , informed consent obtain inclusion malaria sub-study . Study procedure . At age 19 month , child whose parent give consent allocate randomly receive BCG revaccination control enter malaria study . Because BCG leave scar , possible undertake double blind study . However , field staff assess patient clinical attack malaria unaware hypothesis underlie trial blood film read without knowledge individual 's study group . The prevalence malaria child two group determine combination active passive surveillance . Any child study present one dispensary study area national hospital illness suggestive malaria investigate possible malaria . If child history fever raise axillary temperature ( &gt; 37.5 degree Celsius ) blood film obtain hemoglobin measure . Children find malaria treat chloroquine first line treatment time study . In addition passive surveillance , two cross sectional survey child study undertaken begin end malaria transmission season , blood film collect hemoglobin measure . Quality control read blood film provide staff MRC Laboratories , The Gambia . Some study child clinical malaria enrol separate case control study risk malaria . Trial end-point The primary trial end-point incidence malaria child two study group . Malaria define presence ( ) fever history fever , ( b ) obvious cause fever ( c ) presence asexual stage Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia density . For second definition , parasite density 5,000 parasite per ul &gt; , estimate fever threshold study area , require . Sample size On basis previous experience study area , estimate incidence malaria child control group would 0.3 attack malaria transmission season . On basis study 600 child arm would 80 % power 5 % level significance detect reduction incidence malaria 25 % child receive BCG . A trial size would 80 % power detect reduction prevalence parasitaemia 22 % final cross-sectional survey assume prevalence control arm 35 % asexual P. falciparum parasitemia , assumption base result previous survey . Monitoring A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) provide supervision study approve analytical plan trial code broken . Monitoring visit make scientist UK The Gambia .</detailed_description>
