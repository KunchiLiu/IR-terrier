	<brief_summary>Severe anaemia frequent cause admission hospital tropical Africa 10 % child die . In endemic country , anaemia multiple cause nutritional deficiency , infection haemoglobinopathy . However , Plasmodium falciparum infection believe major contributory factor aetiology severe anaemia . Severe anaemia usually treat blood transfusion although transfusion carry attendant risk transmission HIV blood-borne infection . Thus , need explore novel strategy reduce incidence severe anaemia high-risk group child suboptimal haemoglobin level child increase risk develop severe anaemia develop malaria infection haemoglobin level normalize . Therefore , propose study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine ( S/P ) give malaria transmission season protect Gambian child develop severe anaemia . After receive treatment hospital , 1200 child admit hospital haematocrit le 21 % randomise receive either monthly S/P placebo rest malaria transmission season . Morbidity monitor throughout rainy season . Study subject see end dry season document morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To assess effectiveness monthly prophylaxis S/P haematological recovery child treat severe anaemia . 2 . To measure compliance intervention 3 . To investigate whether infection chloroquine S/P resistant strain contribute pathogenesis severe anaemia Study design method Study site : The study base 75-bed paediatric unit The Royal Victoria Hospital ( RVH ) , locate capital , Banjul . This main referral hospital country . The paediatric unit admit 7000 child year , 800 anaemic ( PCV &lt; 33 % ) . Enrolment child : Study subject recruit fom paediatric unit RVH , MRC Hospital , Brikama , Essau Sibanor Health Centres . Study subject enrol non-coercive method fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Screening process enrolment : Patients recruit presentation ward . All child right age group present ward haematocrit blood film do project field worker . Children PCV le 21 % offered assessment project doctor . If assessment permit , patient fulfil entry criterion , write consent seek parent/guardian . The study explain parent's/ guardian 's preferred language , write informed consent obtain approve form . On entry trial detailed clinical history , drug history , family history information bednet usage impregnation obtain . The study physician examine child , document nutritional status record finding case report form . In addition , detailed address obtain . Each study child provide photo ID card facilitate identification contact . A 5-ml baseline blood sample obtain determination follow : - Hb , red cell index , white cell platelet count ( Coulter counter ) - Reticulocyte count - Markers iron status ( serum iron ferritin ) ( first 100 child ) - Sickling test , positive , haemoglobin electrophoresis - Stool examination hookworm parasite ( first 100 child ) Other investigation chest x-ray urine examination carry clinically indicate . Inpatient management : During admission , child malaria treat IM quinine chloroquine plus S/P clinically indicate . Children PCV &lt; 15 % sign respiratory distress and/or 'gallop ' rhythm transfuse . In addition , patient receive iron 28 day , treatment start time discharge hospital . Patients treat condition clinically indicate . Treatment regimens Treatment give follow : S/P ( tablet contain 500 mg sulfadoxine/ 25 mg pyrimethamine ) approximate dose 1.25 mg pyrimethamine/25 mg sulphadoxine per kg stat dose . Oral chloroquine : 10mg daily 3 day . S/c chloroquine : 5mg/kg 6 hourly x 7 dos . IM Quinine : 20 mg/kg load dose , 10 mg/kg 12 hourly 5 day . Iron give syrup target dose 2 mg/kg elemental iron . Assessment resistance chloroquine antifolates : To investigate whether infection chloroquine S/P resistant parasites contributes pathogenesis severe anaemia Gambian child , filter paper blood sample collect first 100 child enter study P.falciparum parasitaemia equal number age matched child attend OPD clinic uncomplicated symptomatic malaria . Nested PCR extract DNA use test mutation gene associate resistance ; Pfcrt Pfmdr chloroquine DHRF / DHPS gene S/P use standard technique . Study subject individually randomise either S/P placebo group 1:1 fashion time discharge hospital , although chemoprophylaxis start another week child likely receive antimalarial whilst hospital . Randomisation block . Block size select enhance blind maintain balance treatment allocation ratio recruitment progress Home visit : As soon possible discharge hospital , patient visit home project field worker collect information social economic environmental risk factor may predispose individual child develop severe anaemia . A housing survey conduct visit determine possible risk factor malaria might act confounders determination primary trial end-point . Field worker interview parents/guardians study subject record characteristic house might influence mosquito bite behaviour . These item include build material , evaluation presence eaves , impregnation condition bed net . During visit , parent encourage protect study child bed net . First OPD visit discharge hospital One week discharge , study subject enrol study ask return OPD clinic routine assessment . At visit fingerprick blood sample collect PCV measurement thick blood film malaria parasite . The first dose trial medication give visit . Randomisation : S/P match placebo ( identical shape size ) store 8 box label 1 8 ( 4 S/P tablet 4 placebo ) . The randomisation code keep seal opaque envelope local safety monitor alone know code , associate treatment group either S/P placebo . Continuation chemoprophylaxis health centre : Study subject receive monthly chemoprophylaxis local health centre direct supervision staff health centre identify health centre train take important role study . Health centre staff provide list contain study number , photographs randomisation group study subject . Study subject observe 30 minute dose vomit occurs within 30 minute , dose repeat . S/P ( tablet contain 500 mg sulfadoxine/ 25 mg pyrimethamine ) give approximate dose 1.25 mg pyrimethamine/25 mg sulphadoxine per kg . Enrolment patient start July surveillance continue end malaria transmission season . Morbidity surveillance rainy season : Study subject follow throughout rainy season . Mothers/guardians encourage take child RVH OPD clinic health centre identify close home time discharge child become unwell . Project staff base health centre , initially identify child trial ensure see , properly investigate treat promptly health centre staff . At visit axillary temperature record use digital thermometer . A dipstick diagnosis malaria use guide treatment fever ( axillary temperature &gt; 37.5°C ) history fever within previous 48 hour present . In addition , thick blood smear malaria parasite collect subsequent confirmation diagnosis . Filter paper sample test S/P resistance collect malaria case detect morbidity surveillance . Study subject document fever ( axillary temperature &gt; 37.5°C ) history recent fever malaria parasitaemia treat S/P chloroquine . The treatment study subject see health centre carry health centre staff accordance national guideline . Study patient need admission refer RVH paediatric unit MRC ward . End malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey : Children enrol study see OPD clinic end malaria transmission season examination study physician finger-prick blood sample obtain preparation thick blood smear determination haematocrit . A standardized questionnaire administer parents/guardians study subject , collect information regard illness occur since last visit , symptom experience , use healthcare facility use medicine . Information use bednets collect visit . Dry season follow-up : At end dry season study subject visit . During visit , questionnaire administer document morbidity mortality . Sample size calculation : Assuming attack rate 0.1 episode clinical malaria ( defined primary end-point ) per month child control group ( figure base previous survey The Gambia ) drop rate follow 15 % , 131 episode expected child control group follow end one malaria transmission season . Thus , total 1200 child recruit trial , study 80 % power detect 5 % level significance 32 % reduction incidence clinical attack malaria child receive chemoprophylaxis . Previous study The Gambia indicate 20 % child 5 year age PCV &lt; 20 % end malaria transmission season . With 1200 child enrol , trial 80 % power detect 34 % reduction prevalence anaemia degree severity .</detailed_description>
