	<brief_summary>Study Question : In premature infant apnea and/or bradycardia attribute gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , treatment medication ( acid blocker motility agent ) , compare placebo , reduce frequency apnea bradycardia ? Background : Many clinician believe apnea bradycardia preterm infant may cause gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) , however , study fail demonstrate even temporal association episode GER apnea . There prospective randomized trial treatment GERD preterm infant apnea symptom attribute GER . Methods : A randomized , cross-over study perform . This cross-over design provide patient 's clinician unbiased information patient 's response treatment . The clinician use information decide whether continue treatment two-week study period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Question : In premature infant apnea and/or bradycardia attribute GERD , treatment H2 blocker prokinetic agent , compare placebo , reduce frequency apnea bradycardia ? Background : The incidence gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) report many 50 % healthy term infant 63 % preterm infant . Anecdotal observation apnea bradycardia cluster around feeding episode vomit suggest clinician apnea bradycardia preterm infant may cause reflux , however , study fail demonstrate even temporal association episode GER apnea . One retrospective study conclude anti-reflux medication reduce frequency apnea premature infant . There prospective randomized trial treatment GERD preterm infant apnea symptom attribute GER . Despite lack evidence support causal relationship GER respiratory problem preterm infant lack data regard efficacy safety treatment GERD , many clinician continue believe GER cause respiratory symptom preterm infant infant commonly treat medication GERD . Specific aim : To determine whether medication GER effective reduce respiratory symptom attribute GER . Methods : A randomized , control mask cross-over study perform . The cross-over design prevent evaluation long-term outcome increase power evaluate short-term outcome use patient his/her control . This cross-over design also provide patient 's clinician unbiased information patient 's response treatment . The clinician use information decide whether continue treatment two-week study period . This approach make therapeutic decision individual patient describe `` N 1 '' trial .</detailed_description>
