	<brief_summary>Chest infection common complication follow lung transplant ( LTx ) . Chest physiotherapy widely accept integral part management chest infection , however evidence available regard effectiveness chest physiotherapy regimes LTx recipient . There consensus regard whether LTx recipient instruct perform regular daily chest physiotherapy routine regardless presence lung secretion ( ie prophylatically ) change mucus clearance buy lung transplant , chest infection . Some clinician believe prophylactic regimen may beneficial . This research compare two chest physiotherapy treatment regimens - current practice chest physiotherapy chest infection ( Treatment A ) independently perform daily chest physiotherapy regimen regardless presence chest infection ( Treatment B ) . From research , aim develop evidence-based treatment guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Chest Physiotherapy Protocols Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very little known effectiveness chest physiotherapy protocol lung transplant recipient . Clinical practice base upon experience individual clinician generalisation patient population . There anecdotal evidence ( discussion physiotherapist European Cystic Fibrosis Conference , 2001 ) lung transplant centre advise patient undertake daily ( prophylactic ) chest physiotherapy part usual routine . They believe may compensate reduce stimulus cough cause lack vagal nerve supply transplant lung/s.There evidence time consume intervention benefit patient short long term . Some patient bronchial anastomotic complication dynamic airway collapse may impair secretion removal . The mechanical effect Positive Expiratory Pressure ( PEP ) mask Physiotherapy , particularly ability splint open airway , provide theoretical basis technique may beneficial lung transplant recipient . We also note clinical benefit small number patient treat PEP . This study aim evaluate two chest physiotherapy protocol use variety outcome measure act start point future/ongoing research important clinical area . This study prospective randomise two month trail compare two chest physiotherapy protocol lung transplant recipient . The protocol : Treatment A – Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) mask physiotherapy upright sit carried chest infection Treatment B – Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) mask physiotherapy upright sit performed twice daily prophylactic routine The null hypothesis : 1 . Comparing Treatment A &amp; B , difference : - Lung function - Chest X ray ( Brasfield score ) - Airway status ( Bronchoscopy score ) - Days hospital due chest infection - Days antibiotic - Exercise capacity ( 6 minute walk test ) - Quality life 2 . There difference patient adherence alternative protocol . 3 . There difference patient satisfaction alternative protocol .</detailed_description>
