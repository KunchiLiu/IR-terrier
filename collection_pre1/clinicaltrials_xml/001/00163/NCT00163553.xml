	<detailed_description>Rationale Lumbar laminectomy commonly perform alleviate local nerve root pain low back legs . Post-operative pain relief may consist oral parenteral medication , increase body research focus use epidural analgesic anaesthetic ( see reference ) . It current practice surgeon hospital use epidural infusion pethidine patient . Epidural medication sometimes administered conclusion operation single dose , form spray1 2 3 , paste 4 , sponge onto expose epidural space.5 Agents use manner include morphine , tramadol , buprenorphine methylprednisolone . In one study Bourke6 find single dose epidural morphine 3 mg reduce pain score analgesic requirement 24 hour compare dose give intramuscularly , suggest direct epidural administration superior parenteral administration . As alternative , analgesic infuse post-operatively via epidural catheter place end surgery direct vision . Cohen7 compare epidural infusion morphine bupivacaine PCA morphine 54 patient find difference outcome group . Other study uncontrolled unblinded demonstrated efficacy epidural narcotic administration ( morphine , fentanyl hydromorphone ) follow lumbar laminectomy surgery.8 9 10 11 12 Thus evidence support use form analgesia , despite report incidence technical failure surgically-positioned epidural catheter . 13 To date , publish study investigate use epidural pethidine follow lumbar laminectomy . Pethidine theoretical advantage agent used.14 As opioid intermediate lipid solubility , less likely leave epidural space fentanyl . The low lipid solubility morphine increase likelihood cause central respiratory depression cross dura site action slow rate pethidine.14 Pethidine also intrinsic local anaesthetic activity . An early study show patient receive single dose epidural pethidine end major surgery longer period analgesic require patient receive equipotent dos morphine pethidine . Blake15 compare patient-controlled epidural pethidine ( PCEA ) intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pethidine follow abdominal aortic surgery , patient also receive epidural bupivicaine . The PCEA group lower pain score , despite low plasma pethidine concentration , confirm central action epidural pethidine . In similar study , Chen16 compare epidural PCA pethidine 37 patient follow gastrectomy . Pain satisfaction score similar , epidural group lower plasma concentration pethidine norpethidine . The current propose study compare efficacy continuous infusion epidural pethidine surgically-placed catheter PCA pethidine patient undergone lumbar laminectomy . Both strategy consider usual practice institution . PCA pethidine use postoperative analgesia follow variety surgery . Compared PCA morphine fentanyl show associated similar patient satisfaction17 . Pethidine also cause less vomit pruritis agents.18 One potential consideration use pethidine metabolite norpethidine . Norpethidine excitatory neurotoxin show cause seizures animal . It renally excrete , hence may accumulate patient renal failure . There case report patient experience seizure use PCA pethidine.19 20 21 In case patient receive high dos , long-term therapy , . The average report dose administer 24 hour prior seizure 1900 mg. By contrast , mean 24-hour dose Woodhouse study18 410 mg , none 135 patient studies18 17 exhibited excitatory side effect . Hypothesis The hypothesis epidural pethidine effective form pain relief follow lumbar spinal surgery , result significantly low usage concomitantly administer ( intravenous ) PCA pethidine . Methods A double-blind randomise control trial compare continuous epidural pethidine infusion placebo normal saline epidural infusion follow lumbar laminectomy surgery . Both group receive intravenous PCA pethidine analgesia well routine analgesic adjuvant ( paracetamol , diazepam ) . The follow-up period 48 hour . Inclusion criterion : - Adults undergo lumbar spinal surgery Exclusion criterion : - Lack informed patient consent - Acute chronic renal failure - Known allergy intolerance pethidine tramadol - Chronic respiratory insufficiency - Epidural contraindicate ( coagulopathy , systemic infection ) All consent patient randomise one two group , epidural pethidine group ( group P ) placebo group ( group N ) . All patient receive fentanyl 2 - 3 mcg/kg intra-operatively part balance anaesthesia . Otherwise anaesthesia control . At conclusion surgery , patient epidural catheter place direct vision consultant surgeon . In recovery room , patient patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) machine attach side arm intravenous infusion line . All participant receive write well standard verbal instruction use PCA . The 30 ml PCA syringe contain pethidine 10 mg/ml saline . Patients give standard instruction use PCA machine . The PCA machine set deliver one millilitre bolus five minute lockout , maximum dose 20 ml ( 200 mg ) four hour . In addition , infusion connect epidural catheter , contain either pethidine 250 mg 250 ml saline ( group P ) saline 250 ml ( group N ) . The infusion commence 10 -20 ml/h accord preference attend anaesthetist . This generally depend age weight patient . Patients high-dependency area neurosurgical ward review frequently usual manner patient receive parenteral narcotic . Patients develop pain encourage use PCA . Any patient express dissatisfaction pain relief offer injection intramuscular morphine ( 50 mcg/kg ) rescue medication every 2 hour . At time , epidural infusion increase 10 ml/h maximum 40 ml/h . All patient visit blinded study personnel 1 , 4 , 24 48 hour collection data , also twice daily hospital acute pain service . At end 48 hour , epidural catheter remove patient treat accord usual hospital pain management practice . In event severe adverse reaction , uncontrollable pain , patient exclude participation study , unblinded . Pain management accordance wish acute pain team treat unit . Data patient analyse accord `` intention treat '' criterion . Primary end-point : - Cumulative 24-hour pethidine consumption Patient data : - Age - Gender - Body mass index - Current medication - Preoperative opioid analgesic use ( none , low , high - high dose &gt; 300 mg codeine dextropropoxyphene daily oral morphine parenteral opioid use ) - Compensable status ( HNC , TAC , WCV PMI/SUR ) 22 Surgical data : - Anatomical extent surgery ( number spinal level ) - Highest anatomical surgical level - Experience level primary surgeon ( trainee consultant ) - Anatomical level epidural tip ( identified postoperative X-Ray take routine care ) - Dural tear time surgery ( yes/no ) - Spinal instrumentation ( yes/no ) Other end-points ( 1 , 4 , 24 48 hour unless state ) : - Cumulative pethidine dose - Cumulative morphine dose - VAS score pain rest movement - Sedation score ( 1 - 4 ) 16 - VAS score nausea , pruritis - Other adverse event : agitation , tremor , hallucination , seizure - Patient satisfaction scale pain control study ( 48 hour ) ( dissatisfy , dissatisfy , neutral , satisfied , satisfy ) 17 - Plasma pethidine norpethidine level ( 24 hour ) - Physiotherapy assessment ability deep breathe &amp; cough ( unable , poor , adequate , good ) - Length inpatient stay Statistical consideration The study power detect difference cumulative 24-hour pethidine consumption . Based baseline 24-hour consumption 410 mg 18 standard deviation 100 16 , power 0.8 significance level 0.05 , sample size require detect 20 % difference pethidine consumption 24 subject per group . This difference would consider clinically significant . A total 60 patient enrol allow loss data due participant drop-out . The analysis intention-to-treat basis . The unpaired Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U-test use analyse univariate parametric non-parametric data respectively . Serial measurement analyse use repeat measure analysis variance ; significant overall difference group investigate t-tests individual time interval . The Chi-squared test use compare categorical data . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . The number reason participant complete study report . Adverse event report Information concern adverse event collect end-points study . This include pain score , sedation score , respiratory depression , nausea , pruritis , agitation , tremor , hallucination , seizure . All adverse event , whether result use study medication procedural error , apparently independent study , record . A serious adverse event define one cause patient death , life threatening , prolongs hospital stay result persistent significant disability incapacity ( TGA ) . An independent physician appoint review serious adverse event . This review occur within 24 hour adverse event occur . The monitoring physician may suspend study warrant basis occurrence adverse event . All serious adverse event report Drug Trial Subcommittee Human Research Ethics Committee soon possible .</detailed_description>
