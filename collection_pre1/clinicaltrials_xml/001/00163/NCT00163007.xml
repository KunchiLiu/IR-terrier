	<brief_title>Nutritional Therapy Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , short-term study patient admit acute stroke show increased risk infection , bedsore , impaired functional outcome , slow rate recovery , poor rehabilitation potential high mortality patient poor nutritional status . Sixteen percent stroke patient already malnourish admission hospital . The incidence dysphagia patient acute stroke range 30 45 % . Dysphagia increase risk develop poor nutritional status , new case malnutrition develop hospital stay , even first week . In hospital without routine nutritional assessment individual nutrition management plan , risk patient develop malnutrition may increase . In study patient admit acute stroke randomise either receive nutritional therapy derive estimate individual nutritional intake nutritional need , nutritional therapy base routine care ; without routine assessment nutritional status , intake need . Nutritional therapy : enriched meal , sip-feedings enteral feeding . Parameters nutritional status : Weight , BMI , TSF thickness , mid upper arm circumference , body composition , s-albumin s-transferrin . Estimation nutritional intake : Daily registration food drink intake . Estimating functional status : Hand grip strength , Barthels ADL index Scandinavian stroke scale . Estimating quality life : EQ-5D . Before inclusion start decide use percentage patient weight loss ≥ 5 % 3 month follow-up primary outcome measure correlate well clinical outcome e.g . mortality comorbidity . Secondary outcome measure define handgrip strength , quality life , nutritional status , nutrient intake length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
