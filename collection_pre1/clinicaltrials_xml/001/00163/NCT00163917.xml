	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Virtual Reality Relaxation Combined With Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) Morphine Those Undergoing Burn Dressing Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain associate burn dressing change arise purely physical source ; also commonly influenced psychological factor . The anticipation accompany dress change potential set fear heighten anxiety patient aware predetermined time people manipulate injure area his/her body . Many technique analgesia advocate burn dress change . Opiates mainstay , many technique administration describe . In particular use background plus PCA administration opiate demonstrate superior PCA administration alone . Another analgesic/dissociative agent commonly describe procedure Ketamine . Both opiates ketamine limitation cause unfavourable side effect respiratory depression , sedation nausea vomit case opiates respiratory depression , hallucination unpleasant dream case ketamine . Other problem relate use opiate ketamine relate approach treat multifaceted experience burn dress pain solely pharmacotherapy . The need psychological intervention burn dressing highlight many researcher . In particular , Ptacek note burn patient experience anxiety tend high rating pain , large area burn report affective pain great variability pain rating . There strong consistency among reviewer recommend addition adjunctive therapy psychological nature manage patient burn dress change . Patterson et.al particular belief burn patient dress change amenable hypnotherapy analgesic adjunct . The nature psychological intervention examine researcher include hypnosis ( strong suggestion aim reduce tension , anxiety , sensation pain ) , rapid induction analgesia , simple stress reduce strategy , attention information , autohypnosis . While conducted prospective trial involve large number patient , one trial actually make mention randomize participant . Most report examine psychological therapy case report level . While trial case report report favourable outcome , single trial able consistently show significant reduction pain score anxiety rating analgesic consumption . Virtual Reality ( VR ) assist technique modify psychological well-being begin play role clinical practise research . There currently two publication , one case report another prospective randomize trial specifically examine role VR context painful procedure associate burn injury . The randomized crossover trial Hoffman et.al 6 patient physical therapy utilise immersive VR find significant reduction pain rating patient , Patterson et.al describe successful use VR hypnosis one “ difficult ” patient last effect 48 hour . Reviews psychological therapy patient burn dress change address need systematic control trial supplement exist evidence clearly define role intervention . Coupled need knowledge appropriate psychological intervention ideal situation prove beneficial . Patterson feel good anecdotal evidence burn patient particular propensity respond adjunctive therapy incorporate hypnosis . Hypnosis screen among burn patient involve hypnotic induction profile demonstrate link high hypnotizability experience intense arousal , great avoidance significant feeling intrusiveness . We propose conduct prospective randomize trial look effect VR relaxation combine PCA morphine group patient potentially painful dressing change . In addition want isolate patient high susceptability hypnosis compare rating pain , anxiety opiate requirement patient less susceptibility . Our hypothesis patient higher susceptibility hypnosis stand gain addition VR pharmacotherapy .</detailed_description>
