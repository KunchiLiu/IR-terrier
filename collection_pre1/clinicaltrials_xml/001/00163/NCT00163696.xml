	<brief_title>Multi Breath Nitrogen Washout ( MBNW ) Measure Small Airway Function Patients With Respiratory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well document significant ventilatory change respiratory disease cystic fibrosis , asthma onset bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) follow chronic rejection lung transplantation . At present , use measure spirometry lung biopsy determine change airway function disease severity . Our aim develop novel technique call multi breath nitrogen washout ( MBNW ) believe able measure inhomogeneity ventilation large airway ( conductive region , generation 1 - 16 ) well small airway ( acinar region 17 - 23 ) . Our belief measurement much subtle current technique sensitive measure large small airway change disease . The MBNW also give u insight particular zone lung affect differ respiratory disease . For example , believe BOS begin distal portion lung ( acinar region ) proceeds towards proximal zone ( conductive ) . However , present current technique differentiate damage acinar zone conductive zone indeed accurately measure small airway ( acinar zone ) function . We believe MBNW capacity .</detailed_description>
