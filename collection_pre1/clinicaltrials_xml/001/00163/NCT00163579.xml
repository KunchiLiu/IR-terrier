	<brief_title>The Impact Bryophyllum Preterm Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm delivery ( delivery 37 +0 week gestation ) still lead cause perinatal mortality morbidity western country . Due fact possible achieve mortality rate 5â€° , aspire WHO , effective decrease current preterm delivery rate . An exact ascertainment etiology preterm delivery hardly possible , multiple , partly overlap multifactorial etiology exist . Various pathology ( e.g . placenta , fetus uterus endocrine dysfunction ) may lead preterm delivery preterm contraction . Traditional diagnostic tool preterm contractions/preterm delivery consist clinical examination ( digital palpation cervix ) record contraction tocogram . Both method low sensitivity predictive value . Furthermore clinical examination high interobserver variability 29 % . With introduction transvaginal sonographic measurement , sensitivity preterm delivery could substantially elevate . Despite intensive effort field preventive care , screen therapeutic intervention ( e.g . use tocolytics ) , incidence preterm delivery remain stable two decade . For inhibit labor , beta-mimetics utilise 20 year . Beta mimetics currently able prevent preterm labor average approximately 48 hour . Other medicament tocolytic property include calcium antagonist , prostaglandin inhibitor currently , antagonist oxytocic receptor . However , conventional labor inhibitor show considerable side effect , cardiovascular effect ( e.g.tachycardia ) tremor case beta mimetics . Due stagnant long-term result conventional labor inhibitor , look alternative medicament , especially low side effect profile . The phytopharmacon Bryophyllum , produce leaf Bryophyllum pinnatum , available 5 % aqueous tincture , 33 % dilution 50 % trituration . Bryophyllum use since 1970 tocolysis , either orally intravenously . However , predominant use anthroposophical clinic , clinical trial evaluation rarely perform . Currently , vitro study endorse inhibition myometrial contractibility . In contrast conventional labor inhibitor , side effect occasionally observe case Bryophyllum ( e.g . skin irritation ) . To evaluate tocolytic effect orally applicated Bryophyllum versus Placebo case patient preterm contraction , twin pregnancy patient risk preterm delivery , due previous preterm contractions/preterm delivery . Bryophyllum Placebo give prophylactic , parallel conventional labor inhibitor case preterm contraction .</detailed_description>
