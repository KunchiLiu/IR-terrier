	<brief_summary>The inferior vena cava ( IVC ) large vein enters bottom part heart . Venous blood low portion body drain IVC . The IVC return blood back heart . An IVC filter place help prevent blood clot move legs heart lung . The idea behind use filter IVC capture potential fatal pulmonary embolus anatomical location may pose less risk patient . Early filter , 1960 's 70 's , remain vein permanently . More recently , temporary retrievable filter develop widely use . Complications demonstrate long-term placement IVC filter . In randomised study find patient IVC filter placement great three time incidence recurrent deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) compare control population two year . Blockage vein , recurrent pulmonary embolus , filter penetration filter fragmentation describe . With advent retrievable filter ( filter place temporarily remove later date ) renew popularity placement temporary filter . To knowledge , one yet follow population intend temporary IVC filter , undergo fail retrieval , consequently end permanent IVC filter . We plan prospectively enrol 40 Alfred patient undergone temporary IVC filter placement subsequently fail IVC filter retrieval . Our aim evaluate long term outcomes patient fail IVC retrieval . Specifically determine risk , due fail filter retrieval , : - IVC stenosis - IVC occlusion - Development DVT - analyse clinical outcome ( symptom ) , prevalence distribution Patients receive routine care data analyse annually collect .

	<brief_title>Failed Retrieval Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) Filters : Long-Term Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical Study Protocol Failed Retrieval Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) filter : long-term outcome Study Objective To evaluate long term outcome fail IVC retrieval . Background Long-term placement IVC filter without complication . Descosous et al . demonstrated patient IVC filter placement great three time incidence recurrent DVT two year . Pulmonary Emboli ( PE ) report . These occur evidence PE prior insertion IVC filter . This show Rogers et al 2.3 % trauma patient receive prophylactic filter develop PE . They also occur recurrence ( i.e . PE already demonstrate prior IVC filter insertion ) 2.5 7.7 % patients1 , 2 . Caval thrombosis result occlusion report occur 1-24 % case depend type filter3 , 4 . Guidewire catheter entrapment central venous pulmonary artery catheter placement also report long term IVC filter become prevalent . Filter penetration filter fragmentation describe . With advent retrievable filter renew popularity temporary caval interruption . To knowledge , one yet follow population intend temporary caval interruption , undergo fail retrieval , consequently end permanent IVC filter . This study look incidence degree caval occlusion , caval stenosis incidence DVT patient The Alfred fail retrieval implant IVC filter . Patient recruit four year , incidence fail retrieval The Alfred 10 per year , follow ongoing . Patient Population Alfred patient undergo temporary IVC filter placement subsequently fail IVC filter retrieval . Study Design This prospective , single-arm study . - Patients identify failed filter retrieval ask participate study . They CT cavagram low limb duplex doppler ultrasound annually part standard patient management practice . - Clinical evaluation , history-taking examination filter complication venous hypertension conduct annually , part standard patient management . - Data collect per data collection form analyse . Enrolment Size 40 patient enrol . Primary End-Points CT cavagram use evaluate/measure : - Caval occlusion . - Caval stenosis . Chronic acute DVT evaluate :  Duplex sonography . Secondary End-points Adverse event related IVC filter establish : - Physical examination . - Patient interview . Research Plan Specific Aim : To evaluate long term outcome fail IVC retrieval . Objectives : - To determine risk IVC stenosis due fail filter retrieval . - To determine risk IVC occlusion due fail filter retrieval . - To identify risk DVT due fail filter retrieval . - To analyse clinical outcome ( symptom ) , prevalence distribution , produce result fail filter retrieval . Research Design Methods : This prospective , single-arm clinical study . An make HREC obtain ethic approval study . Participants enrol consecutively . Patients receive routine care data analyse annually collect . The follow-up period indefinite discretion treat doctor . The data CT cavagram duplex Doppler collect research assistant patient ’ history report onto ‘ Investigations ’ data sheet ( see Appendix I . ) The data clinical interview examination collect patient ’ history report onto ‘ Examination ’ data sheet ( see Appendix II . ) Analysis Plan Statistical Methods : This study look incidence degree caval occlusion , caval stenosis incidence DVT patient The Alfred fail retrieval implant IVC filter . Data management , quality control Non-identifiable information collect securely store Radiology Department research office . Data enter excel spreadsheet incidence primary secondary endpoint summarise . Complications Reporting Adverse Events : There direct medical complication might arise due participation trial patient routine care . This study involve data collection change routine management . Any adverse event report identifiable data report HREC committee within 24 hour identification event . Complications result CT cavagram include : - Contrast Allergy - Anaphylaxis - Infection Adverse event therefore relate principally confidentiality . See ‘ Data Management ’ procedure related adverse event report breach confidentiality . Data Management : - Data collate , store analyse research coordinator , Dr. Helen Kavnoudias . - All data form de-identified prior reporting and/or publication result . - Patient medical record appropriately label participant research study keep indefinitely . - All departmental procedure relate research , ethic privacy regulation adhere . - Adverse event involve data management report ethic committee 24-hours research team . Time-frame : This research ongoing . There approximately 10 fail retrieval year . References : 1 .
