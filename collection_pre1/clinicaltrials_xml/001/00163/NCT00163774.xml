	<brief_summary>Analysis cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) oxygenation use complementary focal global monitoring technique permit delivery inform individualise 'targeted ' therapy patient severe head injury , reduce episode secondary brain injury therefore improve outcome . Aims - To develop deep understand Cerebral Blood Flow auto-regulation TBI patient base result data collect patient post TBI . - To establish basis multi modality clinical trial severely brain injured patient future . - To improve understand various secondary process continue cause neuronal damage initial injury , therefore affect patient outcome . - To proceed second phase study , introduction algorithm treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ultimate aim study improve outcome patient severe head injury reduce secondary brain injury . It hop achieve improve clinical management adoption Best Practice monitoring measure . The severe head injury population disparate clinical group vary CBF derangement , complex inter-relationships various physiological parameter measure . Common protocol base therapy head-injured patient simplistic fully accommodate variation patient within individual brain . We believe improve outcome , individual derangement pattern identify correct therapeutic combination fashion individual basis . This current practice Australia . The first phase project complete March 2004 follow recruitment ten patient . These patient intensively monitor base data collect current international literature devise new treatment protocol patient severe head injury . We anticipate implementation new protocol improve outcome . We aim : - clarify mention relationship monitor parameter , critical one effect optimisation parameter brain swelling , ICP control clinical outcome . - introduce treatment algorithms/protocols alter haemodynamic parameter , CPP ICP optimise PbrO2 . - study patient decompressive craniectomy use technique possible - compare patient outcomes previous outcome study Alfred Hospital .</detailed_description>
