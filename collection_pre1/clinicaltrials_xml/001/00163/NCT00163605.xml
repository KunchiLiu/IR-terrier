	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate performance monitor safety bone substitute Macroporous Biphasic Calcium Phosphate-Fibrin Sealant Vapor Heated Solvent/Detergent Treated 4 IU/ML Thrombin ( MBCP-FS ) Sinus Lift Procedures . This study conduct two part : part A evaluate safety performance MBCP-FS bone regeneration i.e . amount new bone form suitability dental implant placement . Part B design evaluate long-term safety performance product , i.e . whether newly-formed bone suitable retain implant .</brief_summary>
