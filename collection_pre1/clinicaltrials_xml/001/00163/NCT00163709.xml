	<brief_summary>A trial examine whether new heart failure blood test improve outcome patient present Emergency Department shortness breath . We hypothesise BNP test perform real-time patient present Emergency Department shortness breath help identify additional patient CHF consequently change practice allow patient recieve correct treatment earlier .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BNP Testing Patients With SOB Presentation ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year new test diagnose heart failure become available . We evaluate new test call B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) patient present Emergency Department shortness breath . Patients randomise whether receive new test . In patient group test positive , standardised approach optimise heart failure treatment introduce . We hypothesise approach improve clinical care patient present Emergency Department shortness breath . Measures outcomes accuracy diagnosis 2 hour presentation , 30 day mortality , hospital ICU admission rate quality life 30days . We plan investigate 600 consecutive patient present Emergency Department shortness breath 40 year old present emergency department triage category 3 high . Patients present traumatic cause dyspnea , patient severe renal disease , patient cardiogenic shock patient early transfer another hospital ( within 24 hr ) exclude .</detailed_description>
