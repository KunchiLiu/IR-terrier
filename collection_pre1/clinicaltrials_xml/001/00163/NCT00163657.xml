	<brief_title>Study Liver Transplant For End-Stage Liver Disease Caused By Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End-stage liver disease due Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection common reason liver transplantation United States . Patients HCV always carry virus body . If patient respond treatment , virus longer active . This mean although virus still present , currently cause damage liver . Because recurrence HCV virtually universal HCV positive transplant recipient associate long term , possibly lethal complication , search appropriate therapy must also include method prevent minimize recurrence disease progression , goal improve long term outcomes patient achieve . Corticosteroids high dos immunosuppressive agent associate increased rate HCV recurrence . Finding regimen provide adequate immunosuppression prevent early late rejection episode , minimize steroid usage well high dos immunosuppressive agent highly desirable . This study conduct determine effective immunosuppressive regimen prevent allograft rejection , minimize adverse event time , prevent reduce incidence HCV recurrence follow liver transplant .</detailed_description>
