	<brief_title>The Use Ketamine Rescue Analgesia Recovery Room Following Opioid Administration . A Double-blind Randomised Trial Postoperative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some patient require large dos opioids control postoperative pain , result prolong period poor pain control , potentially increased side effect associate large morphine dos . This may due insufficient morphine dose individual acute tolerance ( 1 ) . Ketamine anaesthetic agent low dos know provide efficacious analgesia ( 2 , 3 ) . Ketamine show marked analgesic effect high intensity nociceptive stimulus ( 4 ) exhibit postoperative pain . When give opioid analgesia resistant cancer pain bolus dos two different concentration show effective morphine-sparing effect , without undue complication ( 5 ) . Ketamine suggest work pre-emptively also many route intravenously ( 6 - 9 ) . Previous study compare morphine morphine ketamine administer PCA intramuscularly ( 10 - 12 ) postoperative patient vary effect . Javery et al . ( 11 ) show pain score low patient receive ketamine Reeves et al . later similar study show significant difference ( 13 ) . The author note postoperative situation morphine resistant pain , bolus dose ketamine lead marked decline pain also remain efficacious several hour . This prolonged effect also note opioid resistant cancer pain ( 5 ) . This indeed may relevance prevention onset chronic post surgical pain ( 14 ) early discharge Post Anaesthetic Care Unit . Morphine ketamine without side effect . Respiratory depression , nausea , vomit vivid dream , well document hence secondary endpoint . A quality recovery score also measure ( 15 ) four hour postoperatively . This study design compare morphine regimen form standard Post Anaesthetic Care Unit pain protocol bolus dose ketamine implement pain protocol inadequate . Any patient pain , despite two dos morphine include . Thereafter patient randomise receive either solution ketamine continuation morphine protocol . This randomised , double-blinded , trial base Post Anaesthetic Care Unit close anaesthetic nursing staff supervision .</detailed_description>
