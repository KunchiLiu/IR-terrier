	<brief_summary>This study look overweight patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , compare effect modify fat diet reduce glycaemic load ( diet 1 ) ; conventional low fat , high carbohydrate diet ( diet 2 ) : - insulin sensitivity ( use homeostasis model assessment [ HOMA ] model ) - lipid profile - symptomatic status ( 6 minute walk distance Heart Failure Quality Life [ HF QOL ] Questionnaire ) - body weight - inflammatory mediator ( tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] alpha , C-reactive protein [ CRP ] , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] ) The hypothesis study : - Diet 1 associate low insulin resistance diet 2 . - The lipid profile well CHF patient diet 1 diet 2 . - Patients diet 1 well symptomatic status patient diet 2 . - Diet 1 maintain body weight patient CHF well diet 2 . - Diet 1 suppress expression TNF-alpha , CRP IL-6 diet 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase prevalence chronic heart failure ( CHF ) Western society . In last decade , progress make understanding neurohormonal involvement progression disease consequently , new treatment develop although mortality rate still remain high . Chronic heart failure associate marked insulin resistance well increase plasma level pro-inflammatory marker Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) increase severity disease . This recently become area increase research interest . In CHF , insulin resistance may present even blood glucose level appear normal . Independently influence risk arteriosclerosis , insulin resistance support progression heart failure . Hyperinsulinaemia also find worsen symptomatic status CHF patient . The introduction beta-blockers treatment CHF may beneficial effect insulin resistance . However , far test drug seem little influence production pro-inflammatory marker CHF patient . The use beta-blockers clinical setting also associate weight gain . While weight gain benefit patient cachexia , common problem CHF , problematic CHF patient already overweight , particularly since obesity know implicated development insulin resistance . Because , would seem beneficial prevent weight gain patient heart failure cachexic . Weight loss patient , however also prevent since obese patient CHF appear good prognosis . As change body weight important implication disease progression , choice dietary treatment particular importance CHF patient . Ideally CHF patient , maintain body weight still attempt reduce coronary risk factor insulin resistance atherogenic dyslipidemia . Traditionally , diet people insulin resistance feature metabolic syndrome base low fat , high carbohydrate dietary prescription . This question recently emerge clear endorsement diet restrict saturated fat ( &lt; 10 % total energy [ % E ] ) allow high amount monounsaturated fat ( MUFA ) , also reduce diet carbohydrate content thus glycaemic load . Metabolic study people diabetes show modified fat ( high MUFA ) diet effective low fat high carbohydrate diet improve insulin resistance although similar study yet available people heart failure . Studies people diabetes also indicate modify fat ( high MUFA ) diet clearly beneficial low fat diet effect triacylglycerols HDL cholesterol also favorably influence blood pressure , coagulation , endothelial activation , inflammation , thermogenic capacity . Modified fat ( high MUFA ) diet therefore reduce heart disease risk . Moreover , energy density control inclusion plenty fruit vegetable , modify fat ( high MUFA ) diet promote obesity . One final benefit well acceptance compliance long term .</detailed_description>
