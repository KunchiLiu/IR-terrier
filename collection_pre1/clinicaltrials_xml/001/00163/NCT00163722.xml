	<brief_summary>Aspergillus fungus find soil , farms construction site . In whose immune system impaired cause severe infection . The people particularly high-risk infection Aspergillus ( call Invasive Aspergillosis ) acute leukaemia chemotherapy post bone marrow transplantation . Currently 15 % high-risk develop Invasive Aspergillosis 60-90 % Invasive Aspergillosis die . The main reason high death rate current diagnostic test good detect infection often detect infection advance stage treatment ineffective . Because limitation current diagnostic test current practice give empiric antifungal therapy ( EAFT ) early treat suspect Invasive Aspergillosis . However study demonstrate therapy result minor reduction mortality rate also cause significant drug toxicity . It suboptimal treatment modality . New test recently develop diagnose Invasive Aspergillosis . These test detection Aspergillus protein blood detection Aspergillus DNA blood . Available data suggest new test make early diagnosis seem able monitor response treatment . However study report date demonstrates use test impact important patient outcome . This trial perform determine whether use new diagnostic test guide antifungal therapy help improve treatment Invasive Aspergillosis , reduce drug toxicity reduce death rate high-risk patient compare current standard method diagnosis treatment EAFT .</brief_summary>
