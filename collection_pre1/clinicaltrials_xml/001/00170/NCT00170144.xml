	<brief_summary>With age , decrease muscle mass function especially energy storehouse cell call mitochondrion . Amino acid , build block protein , insulin show increase muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis thereby function . Branched chain amino acid provide diet seem key process . Therefore study , aim study effect branch chain amino acid muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis young elderly . By , elucidate branch chain amino acid supplementation future potential improving quality life performance elderly . The study involve blood sample needle muscle biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Branched Chain Amino Acids Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle mito ATP production young people stimulate insulin infused mixture amino acid clamp blood glucose basal level . Our preliminary result indicate effect mito ATP production directly relate amino acid level . Recent publication indicate infusion insulin amino acid specifically stimulate muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis effect synthesis contractile proteins sarcoplasmic protein . The recent publication also indicate intracellular amino acid anabolic sensor stimulate amino acid . It appear BCAA , especially leucine specific effect stimulate intracellular signal translation mRNA protein synthesis . It show amino acid , especially leucine , stimulate protein synthesis activation mTOR pathway mTOR phosphorylates p70S6 kinase turn phosphorylates ribosomal S6 protein , result increased activity protein synthesis complex . Activated mTOR also phosphorylates eIF4E-BP1 activates protein synthesis initiation complex . It abundance specific mRNAase determines synthesis specific protein promote . Our preliminary data support amino acid selectively promote muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis enhance abundance transcript gene encode mitochondrial protein . Administration amino acid mixture , specifically BCAA , propose stimulant muscle mitochondrial ATP production . Secondary measurement perform understand underlie mechanism enhance muscle ATP production . These result likely contribute understand basic mechanism regulation mitochondrial biogenesis human potential future application . This cross-sectional study young old . The study use new proteomic technique establish laboratory profile quantify mitochondrial protein synthesis participant . The combination metabolic label stable isotope measure synthesis rate specific mito protein tandem mass spectrometry determine whether actual stimulation BCAA occur differentially young elderly .</detailed_description>
