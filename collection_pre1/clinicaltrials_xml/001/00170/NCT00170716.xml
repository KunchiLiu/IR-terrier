	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Cortical Stimulation Treatment Stroke Patients With Upper Extremity Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause serious , long-term disability United States . According American Stroke Association , prevalence stroke U.S. approximately 4.8 million approximately 700,000 additional stroke occur annually . The 2001 overall death rate stroke 58 % . Of survive , 30 50 percent regain functional independence , 15 30 percent permanently disable , 20 % require institutional care three month onset . The common neurological deficit among stroke survivor , thus substantial contributor post-stroke disability , motor weakness one ( hemiparesis ) side body . Presently , treatment available patient motor deficit rehabilitative therapy . However , many patient responsive standard rehabilitative therapy achieve less satisfactory improvement function . The primary objective study determine safety effectiveness target sub-threshold epidural cortical stimulation deliver concurrent rehabilitation activity enhance motor recovery patient suffer hemiparesis ( motor weakness one half body ) affect upper extremity ( shoulder , arm , wrist , hand ) follow stroke . In addition evaluating change baseline level , safety efficacy measure compare patient undergo rehabilitation activity without cortical stimulation . The two study group compare determine degree motor function affect limb improve beyond rehabilitation alone epidural stimulation target cortical region .</detailed_description>
