	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , leuprolide acetate , goserelin , flutamide , bicalutamide may lessen amount androgen make body . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving antihormone therapy together ipilimumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give hormone therapy ipilimumab together work treat patient advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To generally test whether addition CTLA-4 blockade enhance clinical treatment response advance prostate cancer patient compare treatment AA therapy alone . II . To specifically examine whether concomitant AA therapy + MDX-010 use prolong progression-free interval advance prostate cancer patient compare inductive short-term AA therapy alone . III . To specifically examine whether concomitant AA therapy + MDX-010 use enhance initial PSA response advance prostate cancer patient compare inductive short-term AA therapy alone . IV . To specifically examine whether delayed MDX-010 use induce PSA response patient experience disease progression follow cessation short-term AA therapy . V. To generally examine whether MDX-010 enhances host immune response might involve confer treatment advantage patient receive AA therapy . VI . To specifically examine whether MDX-010 potentiates T-cell response advance prostate cancer patient initiate inductive short-term AA therapy . VII . To examine whether treatment induce T-cell response correlate clinical response treatment . VIII . To examine whether short-term AA ( +/- MDX-010 ) induce appearance newly emigrate T immature and/or B cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive either leuprolide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) goserelin subcutaneously ( SC ) day 0 , 28 , 56 . Patients also receive oral flutamide three time daily oral bicalutamide daily . Treatment antiandrogen ( AA ) therapy continue 3 month ( 3-4 month patient initiated AA therapy &lt; = 21 day prior enrollment ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 7 ( within 7-28 day post-initiation AA therapy patient initiated AA therapy &lt; = 21 day prior enrollment ) AA therapy . Arm II : Patients receive AA therapy arm I . Patients may crossover arm II case disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>

GuillianBarre Syndrome ) Concurrent malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer For patient elect undergo baseline transrectal needle biopsy prostate , current usage systemic anticoagulation therapy , i.e . heparin Coumadin inability discontinue aspirin , aspirincontaining product ibuprofen seven day prior prostate biopsy require study No investigational drug allow study Other chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy may use patient study</criteria>
