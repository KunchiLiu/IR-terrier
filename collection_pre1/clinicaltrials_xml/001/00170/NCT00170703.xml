	<brief_title>Assessment Cortical Stimulation Combined With Rehabilitation Enhance Recovery Broca 's Aphasia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death common cause disability United States . According American Stroke Association , prevalence stroke U.S. approximately 4.8 million approximately 700,000 additional stroke occur annually . Approximately 150,000 250,000 stroke survivor become severely permanently disabled year . A common neurological deficit among stroke survivor , thus substantial contributor post-stroke disability Broca 's aphasia , condition patient unable speak normally , effectively organize muscular movement require speech . Broca 's aphasia often refer `` non-fluent '' `` motor '' aphasia essentially patient impaired motor ability speech thus , become non-fluent speech/language . The loss speech patient extremely debilitate enormous social economic impact quality life patient . Presently , treatment available patient Broca 's aphasia speech-language rehabilitation . However , rehabilitation , many patient achieve less satisfactory improvement speech-language function thus , leave significant disability . Since Broca 's aphasia largely due impairment language-related motor function , researcher clinician believe likely cortical stimulation conjunction speech rehabilitation may also enhance recovery language motor function Broca 's aphasia patient . This study propose evaluate safety effectiveness cortical electrical stimulation study subject Broca 's aphasia stroke , deliver concurrent speech-language rehabilitation . In addition evaluating change baseline level , safety efficacy measure compare patient undergo speech-language rehabilitation activity without cortical stimulation . The two study group compare determine degree aphasia improve beyond rehabilitation alone epidural stimulation target cortical region .</detailed_description>
