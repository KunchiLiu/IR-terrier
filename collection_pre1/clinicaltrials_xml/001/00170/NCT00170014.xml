	<detailed_description>The study involve magnetocardiography almost exclusively focused evaluate possible clinical application device . Leder et al saw need investigate reproducibility High Temperature Superconducting ( HTS- ) MCG measurement . They test 18 healthy volunteer , state assessment reproducibility HTS-MCGs normal heart prerequisite condition definition significant level change , instance , may observe serial measurement patient suffer acute coronary syndrome . They also point potentially strong electromagnetic interference inside hospital , likely different noise find engineering laboratory MCGs originally calibrate test . A respectable reproducibility MCG measurements crucial clinical application . Leder et al studied reproducibility QRS complex , ST segment , T wave . They find reproducibility measurement depolarization phase high , whereas reproducibility repolarization reading considerably low . The result lead Leder et al conclude technical development need improve signal-to-noise ratio allow clinical application repolarization abnormality recognize Acute Coronary Syndromes . In study , focus repolarization phase assess reproducibility T wave . Comparison score result base computer analysis provide basis evaluation . Visual interpretation two examiner also compare .</detailed_description>
