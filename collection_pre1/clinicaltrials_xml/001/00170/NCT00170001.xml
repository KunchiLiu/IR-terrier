	<brief_title>Which Supraesophageal Reflux Symptoms Reliably Respond Proton-Pump-Inhibitor ( PPI ) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Estimates suggest 50 % Voice Clinic patient 10 % ENT Pulmonology outpatient seek medical care chronic laryngopharyngeal symptom result supraesophageal reflux ( SER ) . While many anecdotal uncontrolled study show significant clinical benefit Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPIs ) , conclusion support small , randomized , placebo-controlled study . The recent negative Vaezi trial ( unpublished ) limit bias introduce patient enrollment process due reliance physician diagnosis SER . This bias become clear conduction Supraesophageal Reflux Questionnaire ( SRQ ) Validation Study ( Mayo , press ) , demonstrated Otolaryngologists vary threshold consider diagnosis SER . This project aim remove selection bias study design . Hypotheses/Questions : Our underlying assumption follow : SER due passage gastric content esophagus ; adequate acid suppression provide PPI , less overall volume available reflux , improve SER . We hypothesize person particular cluster symptom due SER complete resolution symptom adequate acid suppression PPI administer adequate duration time . Primary Aim : - To determine symptom ( ) ( chronic cough , hoarseness , sore throat , globus sensation , throat clearing ) completely ameliorate PPI therapy hence reflective SER . Secondary Aims : - To determine feature patient 's history predictive positive response PPI therapy , confer lack response ; - To develop score system SRQ would predict diagnosis SER . Methods : Design : Large simple randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial subject chronic laryngopharyngeal symptom . Population : Subjects recruit Olmsted County General ENT Clinic Pulmonary Chronic Cough Clinic . Inclusion Criteria : Subjects must least 1 5 chronic ( present least one month ) recurrent ( least twice per week ) symptoms interest . Randomization : A dynamic allocation algorithm use Mayo Pharmacy balance treatment arm confound variable treatment allocation . Study Intervention : Either twice daily esomeprazole 40 mg placebo 6 month . Beyond urine pregnancy test woman child-bearing age , examination require enrollment participation . Follow-Up : Subjects contact phone monthly ass symptom , check compliance , adverse event . Primary Outcome : True responder subject lack least one initial symptom 3-month time period , remain asymptomatic 4 , 5 6 month . Sample Size : Based previous study anticipate 30-40 % placebo response rate 3 month sustain 6 month . We expect roughly 60 % completely respond PPI therapy ( i.e . 40 % completely respond ) . Assuming 140 patient completely respond , would need 350 patient PPI therapy . Hence , 70 subject randomize receive PPI therapy 30 randomize placebo symptom group total N=500 . Analysis : Logistic regression . Significance : This project identify patient laryngopharyngeal symptom likely benefit empiric PPI therapy . Until clarified symptom best respond respond therapy , bound repeat error past . Finally , project validate SRQ use future trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary complaint include one following symptom : chronic cough ( dry , hack , nocturnal ) , hoarseness , sore throat , globus sensation , throat clearing . These symptom identify yes response SRQ ( Appendix 7 ) item 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 . Furthermore , symptom ( ) must chronic ( present least 1 month ) , recurrent ( least twice per week ) . These criterion correspond SRQ column page 35 . The first column asks : When life first notice symptom ? A response either number 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 meet criteria chronic . The second column asks : How frequently notice symptom ? A response either number 3 , 4 , 5 meet criteria recurrent . History head neck cancer/radiation/surgery ( SRQ item 15 , 16 , 17 ) History esophagus/stomach surgery ( SRQ item 22 ) Peptic duodenal ulcer disease ; stomach gastric ulcer disease ; history esophageal stricture , Barrett 's esophagus , esophagitis , tumor esophagus stomach ( SRQ item 23 review electronic surgical record Mayo Clinic patient ) Presence alarm symptom ( hemoptysis , unexplained loss 10 pound past 3 month ) , obtain Appendix 5 Community Subjects , medical record clinic subject .
