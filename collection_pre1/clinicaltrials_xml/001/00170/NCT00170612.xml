	<brief_summary>Pneumonia common reason admission Fijian child hospital . The common germ cause pneumonia `` streptococcus pneumoniae . '' It common cause meningitis ( infection around brain spinal cord ) , ear infection , blood infection live nose human . A vaccine develop help prevent common disease prevent one quarter pneumonia case expensive . This study explore new way give vaccine affordable , safe , effective country Fiji . About 550 Fijian infant present 6 week age , first diptheria , tetanus , toxoid , pertussis vaccine immunization , one participate Health Centers Colonial War Memorial Hospital urban Suva , Fiji enrol . Children remain study 2 year . Study procedure include full vaccination 7 type pneumococcus , blood test , nasal swab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research project begin study alternative strategy Pnc ( Pneumococcus ) immunization child develop country . In original study , infant present health center urban Fiji randomize receive 1 , 2 , 3 dos PCV ( Prevnar ) follow dose 23-valent PPS ( Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ) 6 9 month age . The regimen compare 2 control group respect immunogenicity , impact carriage vaccine type Pnc , response small dose PPS 15 month age . After trial underway 228 infant recruit , concern raise safety PPS infancy . Specifically concern raise might result later immunological hyporesponsiveness recipient , serotypes . After thorough review decide proceed study , modify address directly issue potential hyporesponsiveness , give PPS child 12 month age . This protocol represent completion study new design child already enrol , new design cohort child enrol . The newly design trial single blind , open-label , randomize , control trial 550 healthy infant . Infants randomize 1 8 equal group receive 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 dos PCV ( Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ) , without booster PPS 12 month age . Two control group recruit , 1 receive PCV infancy receive dose PPS 12 month age . At 18 month age , infant receive 20 percent dose PPS stimulate allow assessment immunological memory . At 2 year age , child receive one dose PCV ( Groups E , F , G H ) receive single dose PCV . Blood sample take 18 week age , 12 month age , 18 month dose 4 week later . In addition half child blood sample take 9 month half sample take 2 week 12 month dose PPS . The 9- 12-month blood sample ass long-term persistence circulate antibody avidity maturation follow 1 , 2 , 3 dose primary series PCV . The primary objective demonstrate noninferiority 19 month age , group receive PPS 12 month respect proportion child group , satisfactory immune response 19 month age , measure OPA 11 serotypes include PPS OPA develop . The secondary objective ass immunogenicity impact carriage various Pnc vaccination regimens combine 1 3 dos PCV dose PPS , concern regard potential development hyporesponsiveness . Endpoints evaluate include serotype specific immunoglobulin G antibody measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 23 serotypes PPS , avidity assay serotypes , opsonophagocytic assay 11 serotypes assays currently available , Pnc carriage serotype . With hyporesponsiveness primary endpoint interest scheme analysis propose require minimum sample size 500 .</detailed_description>
