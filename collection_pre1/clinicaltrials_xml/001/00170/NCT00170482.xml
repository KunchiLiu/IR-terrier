	<brief_summary>The body 's immune system ( fights infection ) know decline age process , result increase risk catch infection . Vaccinations also effective protect old people infection young people . The purpose study well understand vaccine effective old people . The researcher believe immune response old people get high dose vaccine similar immune response young adult get standard ( low ) dose vaccine . This study substudy main study , evaluate flu vaccine people 65 year old . Volunteers main study ask participate substudy . The substudy require give 2 additional blood sample in-depth look immune response flu vaccine give main study . Substudy volunteer 3 clinic visit participate 28 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elderly Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need increase protection influenza convey elderly person inactivate influenza virus vaccine . Serum antibody titer primary surrogate marker immunity influenza vaccination ; increase antigen dose show increase serum antibody response vaccinate person , include elderly . However know remainder immune system respond high dose influenza antigen . This study link DMID protocols 04-100 05-0055 . This study conduct substudy DMID 04-100 University Maryland , Baltimore . Subjects age 65 year old , meet entry criterion primary study , approach participation immunology substudy volunteer receive single intramuscular injection either high-dose standard-dose license 2004-2005 trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine . A minimum 30 elderly subject ( possibility 60 elderly subject ) enrol substudy . The substudy require extra 100 ml ( total blood draw 120 ml ) blood drawn 20 ml venipuncture obtain hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) titer ( per primary study ) day 0 28 . To minimize adverse side effect , additional 100 ml blood require substudy obtain venipuncture site 20 ml blood obtain HAI titer ( i.e. , blood collection stop 20 ml HAI drawn , researcher attempt obtain additional blood separate venipuncture site ) . Subjects ' blood evaluate key humoral cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) responses good understand mechanism underlie predict suboptimal immune response one three influenza vaccine antigens observe elderly . With regard specific study objective , blood sample submit follow analysis : ( 1 ) measurement serum anti-HA ( hemagglutinin ) IgG IgA antibodies ELISA ; ( 2 ) IgG antibody subclasses ; ( 3 ) IgG IgA avidity , ( 4 ) virus neutralize functional assay ; ( 5 ) HAI antibody titer . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) isolate subject evaluate follow : ( 1 ) `` central '' `` effector '' memory T cell response , include proliferative response cytokine production profile flow cytometry ; ( 2 ) IFN-gamma production ELISPOT , follow specific antigenic stimulation ; ( 3 ) measurement ex vivo frequency circulate influenza-specific T cell use commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or MHC/pentamers flow cytometry ; ( 4 ) role regulatory T cell modulation influenza responses elderly . Studies measurement ex vivo frequency circulate influenza-specific T cell ( use commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or MHC/pentamers flow cytometry ) concentrate IFN-gamma , cytokine show many investigator play central role host immune response influenza antigen . If promising result observe , cytokine ( e.g. , IL-12 , TNF-alpha ) might also evaluate future investigation sufficient cell resource available . Major factor involve decision concentrate study IFN-gamma include need remain focus define set scientific question fact access limit number peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) might preclude study additional cytokine .</detailed_description>
