	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) number one cause infectious morbidity mortality worldwide account 8 million case 3 million death annually . The impact TB child particularly devastate child likely adult develop active TB following exposure bacterium , M. tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infect , child much likely adult develop disseminated disease , include miliary disease , bone joint disease , meningitis . These clinical difference likely reflect fundamental difference immune system child adult . The first specific aim study determine severity disease follow Mtb infection young child associate TH2-type immunity ; conversely , absence disease follow Mtb infection associate TH1-type immunity comparison magnitude phenotype Mtb-specific T cell responses child less equal 10 year old : disseminate TB include miliary disease meningitis ; localize disease define disease contain thoracic cavity ( pulmonary , pleural , cardiac ) , extrapulmonary lymph node ( lymphadenitis ) , gastrointestinal tract , bone ( osteomyelitis ) ; latent Mtb infection ( LTBI ) define individual positive Tuberculin Skin Test ( TST ) without radiographic clinical evidence active tuberculosis . The second specific aim study determine immunologic immaturity associate development TH2-type immunity follow Mtb infection , conversely immunologic maturity associate development TH1-type immunity follow Mtb infection characterize magnitude phenotype Mtb-specific T cell response individual : localize disease ; compare 0-1 year old , 2-4 year old , 5-10 year old , adult ; LTBI ; compare 0-1 year old , 2-4 year old , 5-10 year old , adult . The data obtain present study may contribute improved understanding TB immunity child , turn may help development effective TB vaccine infant young child . The number participant estimate 260 subject enrol course 5 year .</detailed_description>
