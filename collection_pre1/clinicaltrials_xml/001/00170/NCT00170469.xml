	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Immunogenicity Recombinant Anthrax Vaccine Compared With Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthrax zoonotic disease , occur wild domestic mammal , cause spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis ( B. anthracis ) . Anthrax occur human expose infected animal , tissue infect animal directly expose B. anthracis spore . Depending route infection , anthrax disease occur three form : cutaneous , gastrointestinal , inhalation . In United States America ( USA ) , annual incidence human anthrax decline approximately 130 case annually early 1900s case 1999 2000 . However , USA , shortly September 11th , 2001 , 22 case ( 18 confirm ) inhale cutaneous anthrax infection relate contaminated mail . The development new anthrax vaccine necessary current AVA vaccine require growth B. anthracis manufacture process complex administration regimen six administrator vaccine 18 month . As protective antigen ( PA ) central virulence factor anthrax pathogenesis major immunogen current vaccine , recombinant , acellular , protective antigen-based anthrax vaccine , could offer improved manufacturing process simpler dose schedule . Furthermore , vaccine could offer improved protection inhale B. anthracis , could , use conjunction antibiotic , form part management anthrax expose individual . This dose range study compare different primary vaccine schedule rPA Anthrax vaccine license dose Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed . The study design measure immune response , evaluate safety tolerability different dos rPA Anthrax Vaccine . After subject give informed consent , undergo physical exam , medical history screening , pregnancy test , ECG , HIV , Hepatitis B &amp; C test , safety blood test , urine drug alcohol screen . Subjects ask complete diary card record symptom may experience . The subject receive AVA offer opportunity complete license course vaccination would involve AVA vaccination 6 , 12 18 month .</detailed_description>
