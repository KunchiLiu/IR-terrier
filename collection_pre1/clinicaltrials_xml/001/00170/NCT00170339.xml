	<brief_summary>This pilot study design answer question `` Do men receive methadone maintenance therapy lower spinal bone density compare age-matched control receive methadone therapy ? '' The primary aim ass whether mean median spinal dual-ray energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan result different two group male patient . Primary measurement include : spinal bone densitometry DEXA scan . The secondary aim examine role sex steroid men receive methadone maintenance therapy association spinal bone density sexual dysfunction . Secondary measurement include : serum testosterone , estradiol , lutenizing hormone , albumin , sex hormone bind globulin Vitamin D level ; age ; Brief Sexual Function Inventory ; Dietary , smoking/alcohol use physical activity ; Medical history , surgical medication use ; length time use illicit opiate time methadone maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Density Serum Testosterone Male Methadone Maintained Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic use opiates long associated multiple side effect , many due low level androgens patient population . Previous study show long-term opiate use may lead narcotic induced hypogonadism , result significantly decrease testosterone level men . One area chronic opiate use look extensively correlation narcotic-induced hypogonadism associate side effect osteoporosis sexual dysfunction male patient receive methadone maintenance therapy . Marked testosterone deficiency well-established rick factor osteoporosis alter sexual function , recent information demonstrate altered estrogen level may play role side effect well . Thre present pilot study investigate role sex steroid male patient maintain methadone therapy association bone densitometry sexual dysfunction . Free testosterone , estradiol , lutenizing hormone , sex hormone bind globulin , Vitamin D level albumin measure thirty community-dwelling outpatient men participate methadone maintenance program well thirty age-matched control general medicine clinic . Osteodensitometry perform DEXA technique lumbar spine . Participants also complete Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory well assess smoking/alcohol use , calcium intake , physical activity , length time receive opiate well concurrent medication . It hypothesize patient receive methadone maintenance therapy low bone mass density , free testosterone , estradiol , sexual dysfunction score age-matched control .</detailed_description>
