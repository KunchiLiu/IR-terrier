	<brief_summary>Asthma health problem afflict many Canadians . Better method need provide primary care physician way implement current guideline regular practice optimal disease management . This study test benefit provide computer-based decision-support asthma primary care physician , link home monitoring patient . To add value ensure regular use physician his/her patient , computerized decision-support tool link electronic prescribe drug management system . The investigator evaluate effectiveness computer-based decision-support system determine whether asthma patient physician receive computer-assisted management tool well disease control 33 month implementation compare asthma patient physician electronic prescription drug management system alone . To answer question , investigator conduct cluster randomize control trial population approximately 100 physician 40 clinic Quebec , total approximately 4500 patient asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-Based Decision Support Managing Asthma Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Asthma chronic condition responsible substantial morbidity . Direct cost physician , hospital care medication Canada conservatively estimate $ 306 million per year person asthma . Existing evidence suggest considerable reduction morbidity could achieve early prevention timely treatment . Much cost asthma care relate poor disease control due under-use effective prophylactic therapy , inadequate monitoring disease severity , insufficient patient education . A recent Canadian survey find 64 % patient poor asthma control prescribe inhaled corticosteroid , 52 % make use medication daily basis . Further , although asthma self-management show reduce relative risk hospitalization asthma 39 % , 21 % asthma patient provide action plan institute disease exacerbation 22 % primary care physician provide action plan asthma patient regular basis . Computerized decision-support system provide new set tool enable integrated evidence-based care , provide physician patient-specific reminder alert need preventive care management , timely feedback patient . However , limited use computer-enabled decision-support primary care , one report study chronic disease management . A key barrier success challenge provide primary care physician computerize solution produce value-added benefit integrate easily routine workflow . Our prior research show integrated electronic prescribe drug management system provide value-added benefit physician link information dispense medication , alert prescribe problem . Early uptake utilization computerize drug management system primary care physician provide opportunity develop evaluate effectiveness integrate asthma management decision-support system enhance use prophylactic therapy timely monitor asthma severity primary care . Objective : To determine computerized decision-support home-monitoring system asthma integrated electronic prescription drug management system : ) increase quality disease management , b ) improve treatment outcome patient asthma . Research Plan : A cluster-randomized trial 33 month follow-up conduct population approximately 100 primary care physicians full-time private fee-for-service practice approximately 40 clinic Quebec , estimate 2,880 - 4500 participate asthma patient within practice . Enrolled physician receive MOXXI electronic prescription drug management software , equip wireless modem access central database application server , wireless printer . This system allow physician write send prescription electronically , provide alert potential prescribing error , profile current past medication automate link provincial drug insurance plan community-based pharmacy , medication compliance calculator base dispensed prescription , automate problem list creation base treatment indication verification diagnostic code medical service claim file . Clinics randomize receive ) computerize decision-support home-monitoring asthma integrate MOXXI system b ) MOXXI system alone . The asthma management decision support system use data patient problem medication list provide patient-specific management recommendation base Canadian Consensus guideline asthma management . Web-enabled technology asthma education nurse use collect home-monitoring information patient visit feedback primary care physician accordance option select physician patient . The primary outcome , measure 3 month period follow-up poor asthma control , define ER visit hospitalization asthma 3 month period follow-up dispensing &gt; 250 dos fast-acting beta2-agonists . Secondary outcome include one evidence-based quality care indicator ( inhaled corticosteroid beta2-agonist ratio , prescription action plan ) . Primary secondary outcome measure use data medical chart , record prescribe dispensed drug , Ministry Health beneficiary , medical service hospitalization database . Effectiveness computer-based decision support assess multivariate hierarchical model take account multiple measurement patient , cluster within physician clinic , adjust baseline difference patient characteristic . Also , examine whether effectiveness intervention modify asthma control status physician ' use MOXXI application stratify analysis .</detailed_description>
