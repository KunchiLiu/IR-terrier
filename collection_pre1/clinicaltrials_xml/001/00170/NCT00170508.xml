	<brief_title>Young Adult Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study provide depth humoral cellular immune response standard-dose trivalent SV influenza virus vaccine contain 15 pg HA virus strain healthy young adult . Serum sample submit follow analysis : measurement serum anti-HA ( hemagglutinin ) IgG IgA antibody ELISA , IgG antibody subclass , IgG IgA Avidity , Virus neutralize functional assay , HAI antibody titer . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) isolate subject evaluate following : `` central '' ( TCM ) `` effector '' ( TEM ) memory T cell response , include proliferative response cytokine production profile flow cytometry , IFN-7 production ELISPOT , follow specific antigenic stimulation . Serum sample submit follow analysis : measurement ex vivo frequency circulate influenza-specificT cell use commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or MHC/pentamers flow cytometry , role regulatory T cell modulation influenza response young adult . Fifteen healthy young adult subject , age 18-40 year , inclusive , recruited general population enrol study . No randomization masking procedure use . All eligible subject administer one intramuscular ( IM ) injection FDA approve standard-dose ( 15 mcg HA per strain ) trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine , 2004-2005 season , key humoral cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) response compare elderly subject enrol DMID 05-0028 . On Day 0 ( pre-vaccination ) day 28 ( post-vaccination ) , 100 ml volume whole blood obtain complete blood count ( CBC ) differential isolate cryopreserve serum PBMCs . This study evaluate key humoral cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) responses healthy young adult establish baseline immune response use evaluate change associate immunosenescence . This study link DMID protocol 05-0028 .</detailed_description>
