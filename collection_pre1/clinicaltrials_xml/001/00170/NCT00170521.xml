	<detailed_description>Streptococcus pyogenes ( GrAS ) human pathogen lead great disease burden throughout world . In United States , estimate 30 million infection occur yearly . Most local infection skin throat still lead considerable use health-care resource . These common , simple form GrAS disease may progress follow serious GrAS-related illness acute rheumatic fever , post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis , streptococcal toxic shock syndrome , sepsis , pneumonia , invasive illness . Outside U.S. , develop world , burden GrAS-related disease presume even high , completely elucidate many poor region world . It known , though , rheumatic heart disease cause cardiovascular morbidity child world illness . Although incidence rheumatic fever U.S. fallen level approximately 0.5 per 100,000 per year , area , develop world 's child still rate 100 per 100,000 per year . The percentage cardiac admission attributable rheumatic heart disease hospital locate develop world remain range 30 50 % , study . GrAS one best characterize human pathogen regard microbiology , spectrum disease , ability lead serious sequelae rheumatic fever glomerulonephritis . Yet , effort control use antibiotic partially successful United States largely unsuccessful develop world . The health impact uncomplicated streptococcal infection , pharyngitis , less common severe disease , rheumatic heart disease , must better study order move forward control measure . In study , patient age 3-15 presenting sore throat , fever cervical lymphadenopathy examine throat swab submit lab culture . All patient treat either benzathine penicillin , history allergy penicillin , oral erythromycin . The parent give follow-up appointment convey result culture evaluate course child 's illness . Children present sore throat culture give follow-up appointment return result culture know . Antibiotic treatment give culture positive group A streptococci . Within algorithm latitude physician treat patient base clinical sign symptom concern particular child may return treatment delayed base culture result . The override goal prevention acute rheumatic fever suppurative complication . The primary objective study characterize GrAS isolates genotypically ( emm type sub-type ) . The secondary objective describe epidemiology throat isolate GrAS among 3- 15- year old child pharyngitis living Leon , Nicaragua . Primary endpoint study frequency proportion emm-type among child pharyngitis . Secondary Endpoints study follow : The proportion child pharyngitis GrAS isolate . The minimal incidence GrAS pharyngitis child base annual case per 100,000 child catchment area . The age , gender , ethnicity-specific minimal incidence rate GrAS pharyngitis child live catchment area .</detailed_description>
