	<detailed_description>Brain injury continue major cause death disability throughout world . Our investigation hyperbaric oxygen treatment ( HBOT ) indicate relatively safe treatment promise potential therapy patient severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The goal present proposal elucidate mechanism action HBOT severe TBI test hypotheses crucial possible future design Phase III clinical trial . Our initial prospective clinical trial ass effectiveness HBOT severe TBI document significant improvement survival , particularly certain subgroup patient . In second study , HBOT find improve cerebral aerobic metabolism patient severe TBI , reduce elevate intracranial pressure , persistent positive effect least six hour follow treatment . Our work suggest HBOT allow brain utilize increase amount oxygen efficiently follow treatment . Recently , increase inspire oxygen concentration ( FiO2 ) 100 % propose alternative way deliver supranormal level oxygen severe TBI patient . Experimental investigation fluid percussion rat model use HBOT 1.5 ATA ( atmosphere absolute ) 60 minute follow 3 hour 100 % fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) give optimum result term mitochondrial functional neurobehavioral improvement . The clinical experimental data together provide strong basis restorative effect combination hyper- normobaric hyperoxia severe TBI . The goal study evaluate use HBOT 100 % FiO2 separately combination .</detailed_description>
