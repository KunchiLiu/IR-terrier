	<brief_summary>Bloodborne pathogens infectious bacteria , virus , disease-causing germ carry blood body fluid . These germ include hepatitis B C viruses HIV . Surgical examination glove wear health care worker reduce risk worker catch germ patient patient catch germs worker . The purpose study develop polyvinylidene fluoride coating use protective coating worn underneath glove . Some health care worker may tiny cut hand need protect , gloves defect tiny hole allow germ travel . The undercoating add additional layer protection glove . The coating apply liquid form hand dry film without wrinkle , tear , lift , bubble . The liquid contain chemical fight germ . The coating also provide protection skin irritation cause latex glove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal project complete development unique thin film technology use skin barrier underneath surgical examination glove . The technology , antimicrobial upon application skin , develop reduce transmission bacteria bloodborne pathogen , expect protect skin detrimental effect chronic glove occlusion hand wash . Due increase prevalence human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis , efficacy surgical examination gloves become important safety issue , especially health care worker occupational exposure pathogens blood body fluids common . Transmission occur caregiver patient , patient caregiver . However , glove leak frequent potential pathogen transmission great concern . In addition , awareness hazard bloodborne pathogen transmission increase along AIDS awareness 1990s , concomitant increase use disposable glove adversely affect skin condition , cause increase cumulative irritation contact dermatitis heighten dermal sensitization natural rubber latex . This unique thin film technology blend polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) acrylic polymer form thin membrane coating provide tough , flexible barrier liquid , yet `` breathable '' microporous structure . PVDF-based coating apply fast dry liquid solution cast adherent contiguous film directly skin upon dry . The liquid solution antimicrobial contact , dry , coating durable , resistant penetration pathogen , stay intact 8 hour longer . Phase I study establish feasibility use PVDF technology protective barrier wear underneath glove . The Phase I study focus exploit coat 's inherent hydrophobicity create barrier bacterial viral penetration maintain breathability comfort . The coating demonstrate barrier function viral bacterial pathogen vitro , prove safe animal safety study , show barrier liquid human trial . Phase II study complete development PVDF technology use novel protective underglove . The following aim design demonstrate safety efficacy product satisfy Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) requirement : implement Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) establish packaging ; evaluate coat formulation human subject effect skin physiology ; demonstrate safety coating human study . A skin coat worn glove antimicrobial contact , provide barrier bloodborne bacterial pathogen , barrier latex protein , could improve skin condition hand , would beneficial healthcare workplace likewise significant commercial potential .</detailed_description>
