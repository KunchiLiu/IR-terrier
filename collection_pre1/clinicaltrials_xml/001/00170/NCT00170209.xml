	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) spread airborne transmission adult active contiguous TB child , especially live household . Once child expose infected high risk develop active TB - lethal detect treat promptly . This make important detect TB infection soon possible , treat still latent dormant . Current therapy latent TB infection 9 month Isoniazid ; effective take properly treatment long many child finish . Four month Rifampin recommend alternative . In adult show safer much high completion rate . However effectiveness treatment unclear , study ongoing study . The investigator plan compare safety well acceptability effectiveness 4 month Rifampin 9 month Isoniazid ( standard treatment ) child several site Canada country . It hypothesize among child high risk development active TB , intolerance/adverse event bad ( non-inferiority ) , among randomized 4RIF compare randomize 9INH . In addition completion latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) therapy significantly great ( superiority ) , subsequent rate active TB significantly high ( non-inferiority ) child take 4RIF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rifampin Versus Isoniazid Treatment Latent Tuberculosis Infection Children ( P4v9 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On global scale tuberculosis ( TB ) single important infectious cause morbidity mortality individual age 15-49 . The World Health Organization estimate one third entire population world carry dormant latent TB infection ( LTBI ) . Of , 9 million develop active disease 2 million die TB year . In Canada industrialized country , TB continue cause significant morbidity mortality , particularly minority , immigrant disadvantage population . A key TB control strategy therapy LTBI . The current standard regimen 9 month daily Isoniazid ( 9INH ) . This excellent efficacy take regularly , long duration treatment well potential serious side effect , substantially reduce provider prescription , patient acceptance , completion . A short alternative 4 month daily Rifampin ( 4RIF ) recommend base limited evidence LTBI , extensive experience use Rifampin treatment active TB . However efficacy 4RIF prevent active TB known , especially child . The investigator initiate research program evaluate 4RIF treatment LTBI . In first study , 4RIF associate significant high completion rate 9INH . In second study , suspect adverse event judge independent 3-member review panel , blind study drug . Incidence Grade 3-4 serious adverse event significantly low among 420 subject randomize 4RIF among 427 randomize 9INH ( 2.4 % vs. 5.6 % , P=.02 ) . Grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity also significantly low 4RIF 9INH ( 0.7 % vs. 3.8 % , P=.003 ) , completion rate significantly high 4RIF . Therefore , large scale multi-center trial launch , CIHR funding , compare efficacy effectiveness prevent active TB 4RIF 9INH adult ( see NCT00931736 ) . In total 5,850 adult randomize 4 site Canada well sit Australia , Brazil , Benin , Ghana , Indonesia , Korea Saudi Arabia . The primary outcome trial occurrence microbiologically confirm active TB within 28 month randomization . As addition ongoing study , investigator conduct open label randomize trial child sit primary objective compare tolerability safety . Secondary outcome completion therapy ( define take 80 % planned dos ) , active TB . Eligible child HIV infect , household contact active pulmonary TB case , high risk group , positive Tuberculin skin test ( TST ) reaction . Active TB must exclude enrollment . A total 822 child randomize equal number receive daily self-administered 9INH 4RIF . Children follow usual provider therapy . Intolerability adverse event therapy investigate accord standardize protocol , report non-nominal fashion , use web-based system . These report review independent 3-member panel , blind study drug , judge severity likely relationship study drug . Completion therapy ascertain dosage count ( pill suspension ) follow-up visit , define take &gt; 80 % dos within define maximum time . After therapy , child follow every 3 month 16 month post-randomization occurrence clinically diagnose active TB ; also detect investigated follow standardized protocol . The final diagnosis active TB base judgment independent panel two expert pediatrician review clinical radiographic microbiologic information remain blind study drug . The primary analysis compare rate Grade 1-4 adverse event judge probably due study drug . Planned secondary analysis compare rate study drug completion well rate clinically diagnose active TB child randomize two regimen ( intention treat=effectiveness ) rate clinical active TB child take 80 % plan dos ( per protocol-efficacy analysis ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children ( age &lt; 18 ) document positive TST ( absence TST , positive QFT TSpot ) prescribe 9INH LTBI follow indication : 1 . HIV positive ( TST &gt; 5 mm QFT+ ) 2 . Age 5 le ( TST &gt; 5 mm QFT+ ) 3 . Other reason immunocompromised state therapy malignancy posttransplant ( TST &gt; 5 mm QFT+ ) 4 . Contact : adult adolescent active contagious pulmonary TB .

Arrival Canada , Australia , Saudi Arabia past 2 year country estimate annual incidence active TB great 100 per 100,000 2 . Body mass index ( BMI ) less 10th percentile age Patients contact TB case know resistant Isoniazid , Rifampin , . Known HIVinfected individual antiretroviral agent whose efficacy would substantially reduce Rifampin , unless therapy safely change agent affected Rifampin . Pregnant woman Rifampin Isoniazid consider safe pregnancy therapy usually defer 23 month postpartum avoid fetal risk potential increase hepatotoxicity immediately post partum . Patients medication clinically important drug interaction Isoniazid Rifampin , physician believe would make either arm contraindicate . Patients history allergy/hypersensitivity Isoniazid Rifampin , Rifabutin , Rifapentine . Patients active TB . Patients initially suspect active TB randomize exclude . Prior complete LTBI therapy child take &gt; 1 week still take treatment . Children eligible take incomplete LTBI therapy ( le 80 % recommend total dose ) &gt; 6 month ago .</criteria>
