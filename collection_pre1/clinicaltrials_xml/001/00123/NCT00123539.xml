	<brief_title>Estrogen Replacement Reduce Risk Neurologic Injury After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Women undergo CABG surgery higher operative mortality rate , long hospitalization , high hospital cost compare men . A large proportion excess morbidity mortality surgery woman due perioperative neurologic injury . Estrogen consistently show reduce extent neurologic injury variety vitro animal experimental stroke model . These data together strongly suggest high risk perioperative neurologic complication elderly woman may relate estrogen deficient state . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , placebo control study test hypothesis perioperative estrogen replacement postmenopausal woman reduce risk neurologic injury CABG surgery . Three hundred thirty-four woman undergo CABG surgery prospectively randomize receive either 17 beta-estradiol placebo double-blind fashion begin day surgery continue 5 day surgery . Patients assess neurocognitive dysfunction , common manifestation neurologic injury cardiac surgery . Neurocognitive testing perform 1 2 day surgery , 4 6 week postoperatively , 6 month surgery . The primary endpoint neurocognitive function 4 6 week surgery woman receive 17 beta- estradiol compare placebo perioperatively . The trial also evaluate importance postoperative cognitive decline measure cognitive function quality life 6 month surgery , whether perioperative 17 beta-estradiol treatment improve outcome .</detailed_description>
