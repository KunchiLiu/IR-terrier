	<brief_summary>This study classify type hypertonia patient cerebral palsy determine classification reasonable relation functional task walking . Hypertonia abnormal increase muscle tension . It common symptom cerebral palsy lead loss function deformity . This study may help scientist improve evaluation criterion hypertonia , ultimately , treatment result . Patients cerebral palsy older 6 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history clinical evaluation . Participants ask walk lab camera record movement . During test , subject wear t-shirt short arm leg wrap soft , rubber-like material . A piece firm material attach rubber sleeve small plastic reflective ball attached firm material . Balls may also attach skin , use adhesive . With ball place , subject walk several time cameras record position ball . In addition , small metal electrode attach skin adhesive measure electrical activity muscle . After walk test complete , subject ' leg muscle strength measure special device perform three activity . First , sit special chair leg foot place apparatus measure strength , lie back , stomach , stand one foot hold bar balance part one activity . During activity , reflex test , ask move leg , legs move .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) affect 0.25 % newborn baby U.S. alone year . Hypertonia ( increase joint resistance externally impose motion ) common symptom limit function patient population . It may originate spasticity , dystonia rigidity may combination factor . Surgical , rehabilitation pharmacotherapeutic method use improve functional outcome patient cerebral palsy . These treatment always effective , amount improvement difficult predict . The choice treatment base clinical test objective , especially child , allow differentiation various cause increase joint resistance . As result , ineffective treatment offer patient different type movement disorder . The complex torque device use research facility quantify resistance joint easily apply clinical setting . In previous study , portable measurement method develop base hand-held force transducer , allow quantification biomechanical bioelectrical characteristic resistance knee joint different velocity . Using method , find different type hypertonia previously report patient cerebral palsy . It clear degree hypertonia restrict ability execute select functional task , due part considerable variability patient CP . If variability could decrease , relationship restrict ability different type hypertonia would easier determine . Strong argument exist consider different pathophysiologies different type hypertonia . The aim non-invasive study sub-classify patient CP base type knee hypertonia , determine classification valid functional task walk . When validate , serve predictive model relationship clinical evaluation bedside functional outcome . To classify hypertonia , resistance knee joint different velocity knee flexion extension maximum activation stretch shortened muscle measure hand-held force transducer , electrogoniometer , surface electrode 100 patient CP . The strength velocity-dependent hypertonia passive stretch position , and/or velocity threshold calculate . The knee extension flexion muscle classify bilaterally normal , one four type base pattern activation stretch muscle . To determine impact impairment function , maximum isometric knee flexion extension strength monosynaptic reflex rectus femoris muscle measure . At functional level , evaluate knee motion walk . To determine impact hypertonia function , Spearman R correlation use analyze data patient within class . To determine classification hold walk , Cronbach 's alpha coefficient calculate . The significance difference test level significance alpha less equal 0.05 . It expect result study , good criterion classify patient predictable category correlate specific therapeutic response establish . In future , improvement differential diagnosis quantitative method increase effectiveness treatment customize needs patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : This study include child adult patient cerebral palsy , patient dystonia , ablebodied child older 6 year age . Each patient must meet following criterion : The patient must diagnosis cerebral palsy dystonia The patient must able follow instruction successfully complete test The patient must properly motivate willing task . The patient must older 6 year The patient must score 2 3 walk subsection Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) . The patient must cease take medication know affect spasticity least 48 hour first investigation ; however , antispasticity medication longstanding stable maintain entire study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability patient follow instruction accomplish task . Structural deformity level knee joint . If patient unable complete task condition still enrol complete part study .</criteria>
