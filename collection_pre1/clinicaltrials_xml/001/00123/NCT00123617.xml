	<detailed_description>Very clinician treat patient Syndrome X could dispute despite excellent prognosis , debilitate symptomology ineffective treatment regime typical condition give patient miserable quality life . First identify Kemp ( 1 ) , triad angina pectoris , positive exercise test myocardial ischemia angiographically smooth coronary artery continue perplex clinician seek useful treatment regime . The possible pathophysiology chest pain associate Syndrome X poorly understood patient . Suggested mechanism include abnormal myocardial flow reserve due coronary microvascular dysfunction ( 'microvascular angina ' ) ( 2 ) generalise disorder vascular function ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) early sign abnormal leave ventricular function ( 5 ) , patient may deteriorate time , ( 6 ) abnormal visceral pain perception ( 7 ) . Some patient exhibit insulin resistance ( 8 ) . However , adequate systematic exploration psychological social aspect Syndrome X . Several study find increased level anxiety patient normal near normal coronary artery presence accompany chest pain ( 9 ) . Ruggeri et al ( 10 ) find high level neuroticism anxiety small group patient Syndrome X comparison patient confirm coronary artery disease . Panic disorder , sometimes associate chest pain , also often present depression , hypochondriasis somatoform disorder ( 11 ) . Studies investigate various non-therapeutic treatment regime repeatedly show relaxation stress reduction lead few incidence chest pain Syndrome X patient ( 12 ) . However , also true patient CAD ( 13 ) along many condition disorder related chronic pain ( 14 ) . Frequency severity chest pain show direct effect quality life Syndrome X patient ( 15 ) . Sand ( 16 ) find 7-year follow-up , high percentage Syndrome X patient give work , reduce daily activity report worsen chest pain comparison patient confirm coronary disease . Persistent functional incapacity concomitant high level chest pain patient normal near normal coronary artery also find 11-year follow-up ( 9 ) . Use anti-anginals high , self report burden health service . The Collins team recently perform large psychosocial investigation postmenopausal woman Syndrome X ever undertaken ( 17 ) . The Hearts Minds Study , involve 100 Syndrome X patient , 100 patient CHD 100 healthy volunteer find Syndrome X patient suffer significantly high level anxiety CHD patient healthy control . A great number Syndrome X patient suffer clinical level anxiety depression CHD patient healthy volunteer , along suffer significantly high level psychological suffering measure Health Anxiety Questionnaire healthy control . We also find Syndrome X patient small social network high level anxiety counterpart large social support structure . In order address finding , important identify intervention reduces anxiety , also promote wellbeing , improve quality life augments social support resource network available Syndrome X patient . Cardiac Rehabilitation ( CR ) consistently show improve psychological wellbeing cardiac patient , recent review highlight beneficial effect CR symptom angina dyspnoea , stress level psychological functioning ( 18 ) . CR show positive affect reduce anxiety level cardiovascular patient ( 19 ) , high level depression , frequent co-morbidity MI patient , reduce CR ( 20 ) . Women particular seem gain benefit CR , improvements functional capacity , coronary risk psychosocial wellbeing equal great woman men follow rehabilitation ( 21 ) . It suggest CR may reduce anxiety CHD patient reduce uncertainty , provide patient optimistic yet realistic outlook recovery , well provide psychological support promote coping ( 18 ) . Few could argue similar outcome Syndrome X patient would beneficial . As well promote psychological wellbeing , CR also provide patient social support resource network . The adequacy social support investigate relation prognosis patient CHD ( 22 ) note inadequate tangible support significant predictor morbidity mortality . Population base study consistently identify link social support CHD morbidity mortality men , disease severity proliferation show related lack support woman ( 23 ) . Epidemiological study also consistently find link depression , social isolation predict morbidity mortality CAD patient ( 24 ) . It argue CR provide social context coronary prevention intervention deliver ( 25 ) extra social support may important part play patient recovery , adaptation , chronic illness ( 26 ) . The effect exercise intervention frequency severity angina object investigation many year . Some study report reduction mean weekly episode angina 91 % use acute exercise intervention CHD patient ( 13 ) study unable replicate result , almost highlight beneficial effect exercise angina frequency . Nevertheless , study investigate impact exercise Syndrome X , either psychosocial physiological view-point . Erikkson et al ( 27 ) address physical deconditioning apparent many Syndrome X patient use 8 week moderate intensity exercise . Time pain improve dramatically , increase maximum pain experience , peak exercise capacity , heart rate systolic blood pressure also show improvement . Exercise capacity quality life also show increase follow 8 week physical training separate group Syndrome X patient ( 28 ) . Aerobic exercise repeatedly show positive effect psychological wellbeing , anxiety depression ( 29 ) . Patients suffer clinical level anxiety depression show reduction severity symptom ( 30 ) athlete active become depressed prevent exercising ( 31 ) . Studies involve exercise , anxiety wellbeing old population limit , however subjective health psychological wellbeing show high among old people partake regular exercise ( 32 ) . Anxiety reduction increase wellbeing also show elderly men follow 8-week weekly exercise intervention ( 33 ) . Therefore , would like explore beneficial effect cardiac rehabilitation Syndrome X patient . Exercise currently recognise treatment regime Syndrome X , either stand- alone intervention conjunction therapy . Patients currently give little advice guidance relate physical activity due lack research information regard potential benefit exercise available practitioner . Our previous investigation Syndrome X demonstrate need intervention would reduce patient report level anxiety , also increase perceive social support , psychological wellbeing quality life . CR show improve quality life , reduce anxiety decrease frequency angina episodes CHD patient use exercise intervention tangible social support . Therefore , would like investigate follow research question : Does cardiac rehabilitation : 1 . Reduce frequency severity angina attack Syndrome X ? 2 . Reduce anxiety , depression health relate worry find Syndrome X ? 3 . Improve quality life Syndrome X patient ? Reference List 1 . Kemp HG , Jr. , Vokonas PS , Cohn PF , Gorlin R.
