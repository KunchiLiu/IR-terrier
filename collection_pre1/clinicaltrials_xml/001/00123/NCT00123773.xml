	<detailed_description>Background Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) specialise nuclear medicine procedure use positron emit radiolabeled tracer molecule measure biological activity . The common radiolabeled tracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) , use determine abnormal glucose metabolism tumour sit . It general application area abnormal glucose metabolism may present include circumstance differentiate tumour scar tissue ; evaluate presence tumour light rise tumour marker normal morphological imaging technique ; assess response therapy technique deem unhelpful . The Cross Cancer Institute recently fund establish PET centre establish research programme prove effectiveness PET scan Canadian health care environment validate data develop jurisdiction specific oncologic indication . Objectives Primary Objective - The objective clinical trial establish general utility value 18F-FDG PET imaging patient know suspected myeloma , sarcoma , testicular cancer ( seminomatous non-seminomatous germ cell tumor ) , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , transitional cell carcinoma bladder , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic , adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma gastric cancer . Secondary Objectives - The secondary objective clinical trial demonstrate safety documentation adverse event . Study Design The propose clinical trial Phase II , diagnostic imaging , open label , single site , clinical trial patient define oncologic disease . The patient population consist patient suspect know infrequently occur cancer , cover Protocol DX-FDG-001 . This population include patient know suspected myeloma , sarcoma , testicular cancer ( seminomatous non-seminomatous germ cell tumor ) , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , transitional cell carcinoma bladder , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma gastric cancer . Each patient receive single IV injection 18F-FDG . Imaging conduct 60 minute average injection 200 - 300 MBq 18F-FDG hydrate , fast patient . Images collect 40 60 minute 5 - 7 body position ( total count 5 15 million ) use either C-PET , Allegro Gemini PET scanner locate Nuclear Medicine . Standard transaxial image reconstruct collect data re-oriented coronal sagittal slice require . The image examine experienced nuclear medicine physician regard normal physiological uptake 18F-FDG . The location intensity abnormal 18F-FDG uptake note correlated clinical finding , conventional imaging technique , available . Statistical Analyses Sample Size The study enrol approximately 220 subject , approximate maximum 20 subject per specific tumour type ( myeloma , sarcoma , testicular cancer [ seminomatous non-seminomatous germ cell tumor ] , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , transitional cell carcinoma bladder , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma gastric cancer ) . Statistical Analyses For group , investigator calculate positive predictive value ( true positive outcomes/true positive outcome + false positive outcome ) 18F-FDG scan . They also intend evaluate percentage patient 18F-FDG outcome affect patient management . Criteria Evaluability Study Subject Data All subject receive 18F -FDG evaluate safety efficacy . Study Population Number Subjects Studied Approximately 220 patient overall ; approximately 20 cancer type . Inclusion Criteria Selection Study Subjects Patients include study meet follow criterion . 1 . Male female . If female child-bearing potential outside window 10 day since last menstrual period , negative serum pregnancy test . 2 . Known suspected primary metastatic tumour myeloma , sarcoma , testicular cancer ( seminomatous non-seminomatous germ cell tumor ) , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , transitional cell carcinoma bladder , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma gastric cancer . 3 . Age great equal 15 year . 4 . Able willing follow instruction comply protocol . 5 . Provide write informed consent prior participation study . 7 . Karnofsky Performance Scale score 60 - 100 . Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Having surgery radiotherapy within 10 day plan image study . 2 . Nursing pregnant female . 3 . Age le 15 year .</detailed_description>
