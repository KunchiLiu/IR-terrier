	<brief_summary>This study determine type gesture , increase quantity image , number time face show repeating gesture bring activation `` mirror neuron . '' Researchers aim learn area brain necessary perform certain cognitive tasks-that , relate person 's think remembering-especially visual motor task . Because one way human learn imitation , mechanism require transfer behavior person adopt others observation . This type learning could base mechanism similar provide mirror neuron . From previous study learn observation hand mouth bring effective way activate mirror neuron . Patients age 21 55 good health , right hand , pregnant , native speaker English may eligible study . There 24 participant . Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Before scan , complete safety questionnaire presence metal body . Patients risk injury MRI magnet pacemaker , dental implant device . Female patient undergo pregnancy test . The technique MRI use include strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During initial MRI scan , patient lie still table slide enclose tunnel scanner . They scanner hour . During procedure , may ask lie still possible 20 minute time . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound . Each participant wear earplugs reduce noise . They able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask remove machine time . The functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan involve take picture brain patient perform task . All task explain , patient chance practice enter scanner . During fMRI , patient view short film segment people make gesture . Before scan , patient ask complete several short questionnaire . The testing session take total 2 hour . Participants receive compensation time inconvenience , maximum payment $ 200 . This study direct benefit participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol determine effect social content gesture brain activation pattern . We localize extent area brain activation use functional MRI observation gesture vary type gesture , number image show time , number time subject expose face . Study Population : Healthy , normal adult volunteer participate gesture observation experiment use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Design : The experiment conduct employ event-related design determine whether increase social content gesture spread activation traditional sensorimotor region engage mirror movement activity region prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) concern process social behavior . Outcome Measures : The data collect consist accuracy measure cognitive performance , fMRI image , post-questionnaire result . The result gain protocol provide evidence social effect gesturing .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , subject consist healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Subjects range age 21 55 year old include regardless race gender . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude mention , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 21 old 55 exclude . A urine pregnancy test employ woman childbearing age . The result must negative order proceed MRI . Subjects follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , e.g . metal shaving ; permanent eyeliner ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body . Subjects take central nervous system active medication exclude .</criteria>
