	<detailed_description>Background Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) specialise Nuclear Medicine procedure use positron emit radiolabeled tracer molecule measure biological activity . The commonest radiolabeled tracer 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) , use determine abnormal glucose metabolism tumour sit . It general application area abnormal glucose metabolism may present include circumstance differentiate tumour scar tissue , evaluate presence tumour light rise tumour marker normal morphological image technique assess response therapy technique deem unhelpful . The Cross Cancer Institute recently fund establish PET centre establish research programme prove effectiveness PET scan Canadian health care environment validate data develop jurisdiction specific oncologic indication . Objectives Primary Objectives - The objective clinical trial ( ) demonstrate safety 18F-FDG synthesised cyclotron produce radiofluoride Coincidence Technologies automate synthesis unit ( ASU ) Edmonton PET Centre facility ( b ) confirm diagnostic effectiveness 18F-FDG subject know suspected oncologic disease compare value publish literature . Secondary Objectives - The secondary objective clinical trial confirm general utility value 18F-FDG image abnormal glucose metabolism oncologic application , particularly respect Canadian practice . Study Design The propose clinical trial combine Phase I/II , Phase III , extend Phase III ( Phase I/II , III , exIII ) , diagnostic imaging , control , open label , single site , clinical trial broad cross-section CCI patient , include patient Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma , colorectal cancer , breast cancer , melanoma , head neck cancer , PRUNK , esophageal cancer , thyroid cancer , NSCLC , SCLC , neuroendocrine tumour , patient CNS tumours conventional image method fail yield diagnostic answer . Each patient usually receive single IV injection 18F-FDG . Imaging conduct 30 60 minute average injection 200 - 300 MBq 18F-FDG hydrate , fast patient . Images collect 40 60 minute 5 - 7 body position ( total count 5 15 million ) . For Phase I/II study , image interpret single experienced Nuclear Medicine physician regard normal physiological uptake 18F-FDG . For Phase III study , image interpret independently two experience Nuclear Medicine physicians regard normal physiological uptake 18F-FDG . The location intensity abnormal 18F-FDG uptake note correlated clinical finding , surgical biopsy result conventional image technique , available . The image review supplement access clinical conventional imaging data Phase I/II study . In Phase III study image review independently one physician blind clinical data except primary diagnosis one physician access relevant clinical information . In extended Phase III protocol image interpret single physician access relevant clinical information Statistical Analyses Sample Size The Phase I/II stage enroll 20 subject without regard tumour type . The Phase III stage enroll approximately 300 subject extended Phase III stage enroll approximately 3000 subject approximate distribution tumour type follow : Tumour Type Phase III : Extended Phase III - Brain 10:100 - Colorectal 33:330 - Breast 21:210 - Lung ( NSCLC &amp; SCLC ) 130:1300 - Lymphoma ( Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin 's ) 22:220 - Head &amp; Neck 16:160 - Neuroendocrine 10:100 - Thyroid 29:290 - Melanoma 15:150 - PRUNK 14:140 Within cancer subgroup Phase III stage , disease status confirmation available , sensitivity ( true positive outcomes/true positive outcome + false negative outcome ) positive predictive value ( true positive outcomes/true positive outcome + false positive outcome ) calculate per patient basis . The general criterion assessment comparability study group sensitivity percent positive predictive value percent value difference le 15 percent appropriately matched literature value . For subgroups significant patient number statistical analysis comparability undertaken . Criteria Evaluability Study Subject Data All subject enrol Phase I/II stage trial evaluate safety . All subject enrol Phase III extend Phase III study evaluate safety efficacy . Study Population Number Subjects Studied Phase I/II stage : ~ 20 Phase III stage : ~ 300 Extended Phase III stage : ~ 3000 Some variation patient number study anticipated Phase III extend Phase III depend local condition time . Inclusion Criteria Selection Study Subjects Patients include study meet follow general criterion . 1 . Male female . 2 . Known suspected primary metastatic tumour . 3 . Age great equal 15 4 . If female child-bearing potential , reliable method contraception must combine negative pregnancy test enter study ( contraception must use 1 month last administration 18F-FDG ) . If male , barrier method contraception use 1 month last administration 18F-FDG . 5 . Able willing follow instruction comply protocol . 6 . Provide write informed consent prior participation study . 7 . Karnofsky Performance Scale Score 60-100 . Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude study meet follow criterion : 1. significant renal impairment ( serum creatinine &gt; 200 Âµmol/L ) . 2 . Coagulopathy ( prothrombin time [ PT ] activate partial thromboplastin time [ APTT ] &gt; 1.5 time control ) . 3 . Significant Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3 ) . 4 . Granulocytopenia ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm3 ) . 5 . Blood glucose level Significant liver function impairment ( total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ; AST ALT &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) great 10 . 6 . Presence severe infection . 7 . Having surgery radiotherapy within 10 day plan image study . 8 . Nursing pregnant female . 9 . Age less 15 .</detailed_description>
