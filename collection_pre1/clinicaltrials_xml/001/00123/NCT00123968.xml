	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control development safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental adenovirus-vectored multiclade HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , follow without similarly structure DNA plasmid HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP . The DNA vaccine code protein HIV subtypes A , B , C , together represent 90 % new HIV infection world . HIV uninfected volunteer recruit East African nation Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda . This study comprise two part , 1 2 . Part 1 enroll 144 participant randomly assign one four different group : - Group 1A participant receive low dose adenovirus-vectored HIV vaccine placebo study entry . - Group 1B participant receive high dose adenovirus-vectored HIV vaccine placebo study entry . - Group 1C receive DNA plasmid vaccine placebo study entry Days 28 56 . They also receive either low dose adenovirus-vectored HIV vaccine placebo Day 168 . - Group 1D receive DNA plasmid vaccine placebo study entry Days 28 56 . They also receive either high dose adenovirus-vectored HIV vaccine placebo Day 168 . Enrollment Part 2 ( Groups 2A 2B ) begin completion safety data evaluation Groups 3 4 Part A fully enrol . Group 2A participant receive DNA plasmid vaccine placebo study entry Days 28 56 . They also receive either low dose adenovirus-vectored HIV vaccine placebo Day 168 . There 11 study visit 14 16 month Parts 1 2 . All study visit include physical exam , medical medication history , vital sign measurement , lymph node assessment , HIV pregnancy counseling , blood urine collection . A home visit also occur study entry . A 3-day diary card report side effect complete participant study entry Days 28 , 56 , 168 , 210 . There 14 study visit Groups 3 , 4 , 5 ; visit include test assessment Groups 1 2 . As per amendment ( dated December 19 , 2005 ) , follow-up study extend . The purpose extension examine great depth efficacy vaccine . Specifically , investigator explore whether persistent immune response participant receive vaccine well new boost response adenovirus vaccine persistent . The extended follow-up last 2 year clinic visit every 4 month . During visit blood drawn laboratory test , include HIV test . Participants also inform way reduce risk contract HIV . Two week visit , participant ask come study site short post HIV test counsel visit . There total 6 visit per year , 3 follow-up visit , 3 post HIV test counsel visit . There vaccination .</detailed_description>
