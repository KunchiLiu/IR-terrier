	<brief_summary>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) approve many regulatory agency world-wide widespread use United States , Japan Europe . In United States , 18F-FDG scan oncology approve federal healthcare reimbursement non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , colorectal cancer , lung cancer , oesophageal cancer , melanoma , head neck cancer breast cancer . It general application area abnormal glucose metabolism may present include circumstance differentiate tumour scar tissue ; evaluate presence tumour light rise tumour marker normal image technique ; assess response therapy technique deem unhelpful . Current literature suggest functional image 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) may play important role image evaluation patient soft tissue sarcoma , include guide biopsy ; detect local recurrence sit tumour resection ; detect metastatic disease ; predict monitoring response therapy ; assess prognosis . In appropriate situation , possibly effective diagnostic strategy . However , due low incidence tumour , prospective study large multicenter patient group essential define exact diagnostic role 18F-FDG PET clinical setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FluGlucoScan ) Patients With Known Suspected Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) specialize nuclear medicine procedure use positron emit radiolabeled tracer molecule measure biological activity . The common tracer , 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ( FGD ) , analog glucose , used determine abnormal glucose metabolism tumour site . FDG general application abnormal glucose metabolism may present differentiate tumour scar tissue , evaluate presence tumour light rise tumour marker normal morphological imaging , assess response therapy . The Cross Cancer Institute fund establish PET centre research program prove effectiveness PET scan Canadian health care environment validate data develop jurisdiction specific oncologic indication . A cyclotron instal Cross Cancer Institute produce 18F-fluoride use automated synthesis FDG . The three PET scanner Department Oncologic Imaging use protocol . Objectives : Primary - establish general utility value FDG-PET imaging patient know suspected soft tissue sarcoma . Secondary - demonstrate safety FDG-PET imaging documentation adverse event ; determine whether number subject available study Cross Cancer Institute sufficient achieve statistically significant result ; determine feasibility extend study large multicenter design . Study Design : The propose trial Phase II , diagnostic imaging , open label , single site clinical trial . The patient population consist patient know suspected soft tissue sarcoma . This also pilot study test feasibility extend trial large multicenter design view increase sample size strengthen conclusion safety effectiveness FDG-PET image population . With scan , patient receive single IV injection FDG . Initial image conduct 60 minute average injection 200-300 MBq FDG ( dose dependent scanner use patient ' weight ) . The image examine experienced nuclear medicine physician location intensity abnormal FDG uptake report . The refer physician correlate finding result clinical examination conventional imaging . Statistical Analysis : The investigator calculate positive predictive value ( PPV ) FDG scan . They also intend evaluate percentage patient FDG scan outcome affect patient management . Stopping Rules : The subject free withdraw time . The investigator also right withdraw subject study event intercurrent illness reason concern health well subject , case lack cooperation . Should subject decide withdraw investigator decide withdraw subject administration FDG , effort make complete report follow-up observation thoroughly possible provide consent still valid . A complete final evaluation time subject 's withdrawal make explanation subject withdraw withdrawn study . If reason withdraw subject study specific event abnormal laboratory test result , event test result must record adverse event enter Case Report Form . Data Safety Monitoring Committee : Preliminary data analyze safety effectiveness yearly basis study end .</detailed_description>
