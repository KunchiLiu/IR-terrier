	<criteria>Men woman least 18 year age . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 5 day initial MEDI507 administration negative urine pregnancy test Day 0 prior receive first dose MEDI507 . Women childbearing potential must agree practice effective method contraception . Sexually active male must agree use condom . Histologically confirm diagnosis lymphoproliferative disorder determine Laboratory Pathology Clinical Center National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . Only patient follow lymphoproliferative disorder eligible : ATL : Patients except smolder form adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) eligible , regardless whether previous therapy , since effective standard care therapy disease ; CTCL : Patients stag cutaneous Tcell lymphoma ( CTCL ) eligible exception Stage Ia . Patients Stages Ib III eligible disease fail least one standard form prior therapy ; PTCL : Patients Stages IIV peripheral Tcell lymphoma ( PTCL ) eligible disease progress standard chemotherapy ; LGL : Patients large granular lymphocyte leukemia ( LGL ) must myelosuppression ( granulocyte count ≤1,500/uL ; platelet count ≤75,000/uL ; hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL ) , require hematopoietic support ( transfusion colony stimulate factor include filgrastim , IL11 , erythropoietin ) maintain count high level systemic symptom ( fever , night sweat weight loss ) . Patients must disease unresponsive one prior therapy . Patients monoclonal polyclonal form disease eligible . Cells must express CD2 . CD2 expression verify immunohistochemistry Laboratory Pathology NIH . At least 30 % tumor cell must CD2 positive patient eligible study immunohistochemistry . CD2 stain perform exist tissue block fresh tumor tissue biopsy perform . It expect majority patient CD2 expression evaluate flow cytometry majority cell express marker . Measurable evaluable disease . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70 % . Life expectancy &gt; 2 month . Granulocyte count ≥1,000/mm3 platelet count ≥50,000/mm3 . Patients LGL leukemia exclude criterion . For patient LGL leukemia , ANC platelet count consider determine study eligibility . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL . Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( SGPT ) value ≤2.0fold great upper limit normal ( due lymphoma liver , patient allow transaminase value ≤ 5.0 fold great upper limit normal ) bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL unless due Gilbert 's syndrome ( unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia ) case bilirubin ≤3.5 mg/dL . Prior treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy , surgery , prolong cytolytic steroid therapy allow provide last treatment give least 3 week prior first dose study drug administration toxicities resolve . Prior treatment investigational anticancer drug monoclonal antibody allow provide last treatment give least 30 day prior first dose study drug administration . Patients must understand sign National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) prescreening consent form protocol specific inform consent form prior receipt study medication begin study procedure . Known history central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . Pregnant nursing . The effect MEDI507 develop fetus nursing infant unknown . Positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) risk increase HIVassociated complication due increase immunosuppression . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen antibody hepatitis C virus therapy may associate increased viral replication . Symptomatic CMV positivity CMV PCR &gt; 1000 copy Prior treatment MEDI507 . Prior history significant adverse event relate previously administer monoclonal antibody . History within 6 month prior first dose study drug administration evidence intercurrent illness include myocardial infarction , uncontrolled hypertension , stroke , transient ischemic attack . Respiratory insufficiency require oxygen therapy O2 saturation le 90 % pulse oximetry . Active infection require systemic antiinfective therapy physical psychological illness would increase risk patient , opinion Principal Investigator . Any general medical psychological behavioral condition , opinion investigator , may pose additional risk administer study drug patient permit patient complete study sign inform consent .</criteria>
