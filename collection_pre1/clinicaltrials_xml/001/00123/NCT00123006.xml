	<brief_title>Effectiveness DASH Diet Reducing High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study expand upon finding Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) study , show dietary pattern emphasize fruit , vegetable , low fat dairy product overall reduce total saturated fat significantly lower blood pressure ( BP ) . The DASH diet particularly effective African Americans individual systolic hypertension . However , know DASH diet affect pathophysiology hypertensive process . Preliminary data support possibility DASH diet interrupt renin-angiotensin system . This raise intriguing possibility DASH diet favorably impact cardiovascular renal hemodynamics patient isolated systolic hypertension . Therefore , central hypothesis study DASH diet affect central aortic stiffness , diastolic relaxation , renal vascular reactivity angiotensin II ( Ang II ) lower tissue renin-angiotensin system activity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , crossover design use compare DASH diet control diet define original DASH protocol ( NEJM 1997 ; 336:1117 ) . Fifty-five community-dwelling individual age 20 old systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) 140-179 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) less 90 mmHg enter 1-week run-in period eat control DASH diet 3-4 day . Following , participant begin two 4-week intervention feed period receive either DASH diet control diet random order . Clinical measurement take conclusion 4-week feeding period . Outcome measure : Specific measurement include peripheral renal vascular response Ang II infusion , renal blood flow measure para-aminohippurate ( PAH ) clearance , conduit vessel hemodynamics , tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) . At end intervention feed period , clinical measurement make acute administration captopril , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor . The study test whether DASH diet ( 1 ) lower central aortic stiffness measure vascular impedance carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ; ( 2 ) improve diastolic relaxation measure early diastolic myocardial velocity across mitral valve ( Ea ) ; ( 3 ) vasodilates renal blood flow enhances vascular response Ang II ; ( 4 ) affect central aortic stiffness , diastolic relaxation , renal blood flow , renal vascular reactivity Ang II alter target tissue responsiveness Ang II similar ACE inhibition .</detailed_description>
