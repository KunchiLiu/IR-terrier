	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately 11,000 veteran annually hospitalize newly acquire incident stroke . Based American Heart Association ratio stroke incidence prevalence , 80,000 veteran may stroke survivor . The assessment outcome stroke survivor important clinical practice research , yet consensus best measure stroke outcome either clinical practice research . We develop new stroke-specific outcome measure , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) , capture physical function dimension health-related quality life . Objectives : The major research question investigation : 1 ) Does SIS concurrent discriminate validity veteran stroke population compare FIM , Rankin , SF-36V ? 2 ) What effect mode administration response rate , bias , data quality , reliability validity , SIS domain score , cost data collection ? 3 ) What factor differentiate responder non-responders ? 4 ) Will SIS score predict health care cost utilization ? Methods : Using ICD-9 discharge cod electronic medical record , patient screen valid diagnosis stroke . At three month post-stroke , patient randomly assign receive mail SIS instrument SIS via telephone interview . At four month post-stroke , respondent evaluate use Functional Independence Measure SF-36V telephone . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
