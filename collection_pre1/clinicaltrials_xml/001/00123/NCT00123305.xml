	<brief_title>Intravenous Administration Microplasmin Treatment Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While primary objective trial safety evaluation , efficacy assessment also obtain , include MRI/MRA ( include DWI , PWI T2 image ) plasma surrogate biomarkers . Clinical outcome also assess 7days , 30 day 90 day post-treatment . At visit , mortality neurological assessment ( NIHSS , Barthel index , mRankin scale ) perform . In addition , vital status assess vial telephone contact 60 day post-treatment . The trial investigate three dose regimen microplasmin , within range dose previously evaluate Phase I trial healthy volunteer ; plan sample size trial approximately 40 patient . The study consist 3 phase - Baseline , In-hospital Phase Follow Phase . Baseline study entry randomisation ; In-hospital phase treatment study drug hospital discharge day 7 , whichever occur first . The follow phase consist visit hospital 30 day ( + 3 day ) day study drug administration . Hospital discharge define end discharge acute hospital setting . Discharge may home , rehabilitation set non-acute hospital setting .</detailed_description>
