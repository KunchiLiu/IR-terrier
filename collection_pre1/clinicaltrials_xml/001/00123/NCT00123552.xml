	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare different way treat uncomplicated malaria group Ugandan child . The study divide 2 part . Part 1 study consist 600 child , age 1-10 , live Mulago III Parish Kampala . Approximately 90 child live household child Phase 1 portion study enrol Phase II study . Participants Phase II study receive insecticide treated net cover bed . Over course study , participant test malaria present clinic fever illness . Participants test positive malaria give 1 3 possible study drug combination . Study procedure include physical exam blood sample . Children participate 3 year .

	<detailed_description>Malaria one important infectious disease worldwide . New therapy need , generally agree combination therapy uncomplicated malaria offer best opportunity effective therapy prevention selection resistant parasite . Phase I study randomize , single-blinded longitudinal clinical trial , compare efficacy different combination antimalarial regimens treatment uncomplicated malaria cohort Ugandan child . The clinical study link epidemiological survey molecular analysis parasite human genetic polymorphism . The aim study : compare safety , tolerability , efficacy combination antimalarial therapy use longitudinal design ; follow plasmodial genetic polymorphism longitudinal marker antimalarial drug resistance ; evaluate role host genetic polymorphism antimalarial drug resistance incidence clinical malaria . The clinical study recruit participant define map source population Mulago III Parish , Kawempe District Kampala , Uganda ; conduct survey epidemiological factor participant ; follow clinical care outcome extend period time . Molecular analysis parasite human genetic polymorphism evaluate impact parasite mutation treatment efficacy , effect repeat treatment selection resistance-mediating genotype , impact host polymorphism incidence malaria response therapy . Phase I include random sample 600 Ugandan child age 1-10 year . Participants follow 3 year routine medical care study clinic Mulago Hospital . Children present study clinic new episode fever undergo standard evaluation ( history , physical examination Giemsa-stained blood smear ) diagnosis malaria . Participants randomize one three combination treatment regimen time first diagnosis uncomplicated malaria . Subsequent episode uncomplicated malaria treat participant 's assigned treatment regimen . Clinical treatment failure occur within 14 day diagnosis episode complicate malaria treat quinine , standard therapy malaria treatment failure Uganda . Routine home visit make participant see clinic consecutive 30-day period . Routine home visit , make every 90 day , include review study protocol participant , assessment outside medical care , focus history physical examination routine laboratory test . Phase II randomize , open-label , longitudinal clinical trial , compare two combination antimalarial regimen . Following first year follow , recruitment re-opened child belong household previously recruit study , child previously enrol age 1-10 year . At time , participant receive insecticide treat bed net phase II follow begin . All aspect subject evaluation , management , follow-up Phase I , except researcher discontinue 30 day finger stick ( subject still visit see clinic 30 day , finger stick blood smear filter paper perform clinic evaluation , clinically indicated patient evaluate clinic 90 day period ) . The primary outcome endpoint ( power calculation base endpoint ) study treatment incidence density ( treatment per time risk ) treatment arm . Secondary outcome include drug efficacy safety tolerability . Protocol 05-0110 sub study protocol .</detailed_description>
