	<brief_summary>The assessment patient suspect deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) common clinical scenario , despite major advance diagnostic testing , continue challenge . The diagnosis DVT remain problematic : - patient suspect first DVT moderate high pre-test probability ( PTP ) DVT normal compression ultrasound ( CUS ) ; - patient suspected recurrent DVT ; - patient CUS contrast venography technically difficult feasible due patient characteristic . In patient suspect first DVT moderate high PTP normal CUS , DVT occur 10 % case . Thus , additional diagnostic testing require , venography serial CUS , DVT miss , approach costly invasive . In patient suspected recurrent DVT , currently use diagnostic approach problematic limitation differentiate old disease true recurrent disease . CUS technically difficult select patient , particularly obese . Contrast venography gold standard diagnostic test DVT diagnostic venous image modality DVT compare judged . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require new diagnostic test DVT assess venography . [ 99mTc ] ThromboView® novel diagnostic test base 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antibody specific D-dimer fragment cross-linked fibrin find acute DVT . After intravenous injection [ 99mTc ] ThromboView® , uptake monoclonal antibody acute , D-dimer rich , venous thrombus . This visualized nuclear medicine image area increase radioisotope activity correspond location DVT . Based biologic image characteristic [ 99mTc ] ThromboView® , diagnostic test potential : - identify small non-occlusive proximal DVT distal DVT patient moderate high PTP normal CUS ; - differentiate old new DVT patient suspect recurrent DVT ; - diagnose exclude DVT patient CUS technically feasible ; - provide alternative venography non-invasive , contrast-related toxicity easily administer . The present study first phase II clinical trial [ 99mTc ] ThromboView® patient suspect initial recurrent DVT DVT confirm excluded venography . A phase II clinical trial investigate diagnostic accuracy [ 99mTc ] ThromboView® justify : - ThromboView® well tolerate , significant toxicity study involve animal healthy volunteer ; - show promise Phase I trials non-invasive diagnostic test acute DVT .</brief_summary>
