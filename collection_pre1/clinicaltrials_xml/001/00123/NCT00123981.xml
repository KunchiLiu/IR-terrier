	<brief_summary>Background : Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) perform either without use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) obtain myocardial re-vascularisation . The investigator hypothesize CABG without use CPB may reduce risk perioperative death , stroke , myocardial infarction serious complication . The aim present study compare incidence complication clinical efficacy CABG without use CPB elderly patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Conventional coronary artery bypass grafting ( CCABG ) use cardiopulmonary bypass decade apply obtain myocardial re-vascularisation , hence , improve quality life survival . It , however , bear risk death , stroke , myocardial infarction serious complication . During recent year , equivalent operation perform beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass ( off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting , OPCAB ) gain popularity help advent mechanical stabilization device improve surgical technique . Observational study suggest technique associate low incidence stroke , per operative arrhythmia even mortality conventional CCABG . This especially case elderly patient patient significant co-morbidity . Only randomise , control trial conduct include mainly low-risk , relatively young patient . These study document safety efficacy OPCAB compare CCABG , none trial statistical strength determine whether rate serious complication low OPCAB operation . One recent study find graft patency significantly low OPCAB CCABG operation . The investigator find need large scale randomise trial compare result CCABG OPCAB operation , especially elderly patient . This patient group poorly represent earlier randomised trial , whereas observational study theoretical consideration imply may benefit avoid cardiopulmonary bypass . Aims : Primarily , compare incidence death , stroke myocardial infarction CCABG OPCAB procedures population elderly patient . Furthermore , compare quality life graft patency , cost- effectiveness CCABG OPCAB .</detailed_description>
