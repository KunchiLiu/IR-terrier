	<brief_summary>One side effect standard radiation therapy cancer nasopharynx permanent lessen normal mouth moisture ( saliva ) . This reduction saliva important cause feel dry mouth , show increase risk dental cavity infection ; change decrease ability taste certain food ; make chew swallow food difficult . Recent technical advance radiation therapy offer possibility shield portion one major salivary gland ( parotid gland ) receive dose radiation would eliminate ability produce saliva , still treat site know cancer effectively . Recently , cancer researcher Ann Arbor , Michigan use new treatment technique treat patient head neck cancer ( none nasopharyngeal cancer ) , find patient treated manner still significant saliva production spar gland . This study try use treatment planning technique call intensity-modulated radiation therapy protect portion one parotid gland treat know suspected area cancer full radiation dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Using Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy Patients With Nasopharynx Cancer Permit Sparing Contralateral Parotid Gland Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy primary treatment modality patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma , local control directly relate dose technical accuracy dose deliver target volume . Treatment plan nasopharyngeal carcinoma complicate presence many critical structure ( spinal cord , brainstem , temporal lobe , optic chiasm nerve , parotid gland , etc . ) adjacent primary target volume ( primary cancer ) , require high prescription dose good probability local control tolerance dose adjacent organ risk . Conventional , traditional radiotherapy therefore involve treating adjacent organ risk tolerance ( e.g . spinal cord ) even tolerance ( e.g . parotid gland ) achieve reasonable chance locoregional control , leave patient significant acute late normal tissue toxicity impact ability tolerate actual treatment patient 's long-term quality life . Recently , static conformal multisegmental intensity modulate radiotherapy comprehensive irradiation head neck cancer dose spar uninvolved tissue report ( Eisbruch et al. , 1996 ) . These author demonstrate substantial preservation major salivary gland function use technique primary site oral pharynx , oral cavity , epiglottic larynx pyriform sinus , would expect significantly improve long-term quality life , permanent xerostomia prevalent late side effect irradiation head neck cancer cite patient major cause decrease quality life report . To date , technique describe publish literature nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Such technique offer possibility significant improvement normal tissue toxicity , maintain possibly well rate local control due improve target localization . The primary objective study evaluate whether intensity modulate radiotherapy reduce incidence permanent xerostomia N0 N1 nasopharynx cancer patient spar contralateral parotid gland , deliver full dose know suspected area disease . Patients study receive 70 Gy give 2 Gy daily fractionation five day week grossly involved area , 50 Gy give 2 Gy daily fractionation five day week area 15 % risk subclinical microscopic involvement . Patients subjective objective assessment salivary gland function do prior , , radiotherapy . Toxicity evaluation use acute chronic RTOG grading scale do . The primary endpoint study frequency grade 2 chronic salivary gland toxicity . Correlation toxicity quality life assess . The hypothesis use IMRT reduce grade 2 bad chronic xerostomia 50 % relatively test . The required sample size 90 % statistical power one-sided type one error 0.05 13 patient . This assume contralateral parotid spar approach 40 % grade 2 chronic xerostomia , whereas population conventionally treat nasopharynx patient 80 % grade 2 chronic xerostomia . Additional patient add possible ineligibility inevaluability . A total 18 patient accrue study . A significant survival advantage concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation plus adjuvant chemotherapy nasopharyngeal cancer demonstrate recently publish result Intergroup Study 0099 ( Al-Sarrf et al. , 1998 ) study use conventional radiotherapy technique incorporate recent refinement radiation planning available use image-guided beam's-eye-view model 3-dimensional dose distribution . For purpose study , concurrent chemoradiation adjuvant chemotherapy per experimental arm Intergroup Study 0099 consider standard management , patient accept treatment would eligible study .</detailed_description>
