	<detailed_description>Dynamic hyperinflation limit exercise tolerance patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Recently , several innovative approach develop reduce burden dynamic hyperinflation . Two innovation , ventilation-feedback training Heliox supplementation exercise show great promise posit reduction dynamic hyperinflation key effectiveness . In recently complete trial , age , FEV1 RV/TLC control , exercise plus VF ( E+VF ) superior E train alone ( E ) VF train alone improve exercise tolerance . The mechanism responsible difference , part , reduction exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation secondary change breathe pattern . In additional preliminary study , determine exercise tolerance increase patient exercise inhale Heliox . Similar VF , mechanism exercise improvement Heliox reduction exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation . Although intervention promise , definitive data support use either intervention standard care pulmonary rehabilitation . Hypothesis/Research Questions Overview : The two primary hypothesis patient moderate-severe COPD successfully complete eight week ( ) E+VF train achieve longer exercise duration patient randomly assign E ( b ) E+heliox train achieve longer exercise duration patient randomly assign E . Methods : This study randomize controlled clinical trial . After baseline testing complete , 103 subject moderate-severe COPD randomize one three group : E+VF , E+Heliox E training . Follow-up testing complete 8 week . test , activity monitoring , dyspnea measurement . After baseline testing complete , randomized subject trained Physical Performance Laboratory three time weekly . Exercise prescription standardize base data exercise stress test .</detailed_description>
