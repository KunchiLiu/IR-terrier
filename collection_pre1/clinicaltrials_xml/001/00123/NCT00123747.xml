	<brief_summary>At time , compute tomography ( CT ) standard tool use institution stag non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . For patient , treatment planning NSCLC perform patient breathe freely CT scan . However , recent research demonstrate , hold one 's breath briefly , NSCLC tumor mass hold motionless . As result , tissue treat well pinpoint area treat significantly decrease breath-hold planning . This allow high dose radiation give cancer . PET scan promise new image modality show useful stag NSCLC . This study hypothesize breath-held PET scan breath held-CT scan allow stringent radiotherapy plan , minimize normal tissue toxicity , well potentially increase dose deliverable primary tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FluGlucoScan ) Patients Receiving Treatment Planning Study 3 Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy Guided Breath Held CT PET Imaging Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemotherapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) , use computed-tomography ( CT ) simulation , current standard approach treatment inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Despite therapeutic benefit , local recurrence nonetheless remain significant impediment cure . Attempts improve accuracy CT-scanning radiotherapy treatment plan increasingly study . One approach attempt correlation CT image temporally physiologic breathe cycle , process know gate . By image tumor tumor immobilize , gate effectively eliminate effect motion , thus lead typically small visible tumor mass loss motion-induced distortion . Lung-tumor immobilization use self-gated breath-holding extreme inspiration validate clinically , associate improved lung-outcome predictor normal tissue complication probability overall . Several recent study demonstrate PET highly sensitive moderately highly specific stag NSCLC , even sensitive specific CT-scanning detection mediastinal distant metastasis NSCLC . The co-registration CT PET image enables even great accuracy either modality alone , functional imaging inherent PET may better facilitate distinction benign malignant structure . Overall , superior tumor stag capability PET ( PET-CT fusion ) together improve dosimetry &amp; diminish normal-tissue toxicity associate deep inspiration breath-hold ( DIBH ) expect confer considerable clinical advantage use gate PET radiotherapeutic planning treatment NSCLC . The first objective define effect respiratory-gating PET-based radiotherapy plan comparison free-breathing condition patient NSCLC . The endpoint quantify variation PTV normal-tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) certain relevant organ ( lung , esophagus , heart ) via direct analysis calculate volume . The second objective identify correlation PET-based radiotherapy planning volume CT-based plan volume respiratory-gated patient NSCLC . The endpoint objective quantify breath-held , PET-based PTVs NTCPs comparison breath-held , CT-based PTVs NTCPs . This study consider patient locally advance non-small-cell cancer lung ( NSCLC ) eligible radical ( i.e . curative intent ) combined-modality therapy . Patients accrue new patient lung clinic Cross Cancer Institute . Following complete clinical assessment comprise thorough history physical examination , thorough analysis available imaging , consideration available laboratory result consideration ancillary test result ( e.g . pulmonary function test ) , decision make whether offer patient radical therapy . In case uncertainty , test , repeat CT scan diagnostic PET scanning may arrange define eligibility . Eligibility Criteria : - Histologically-proven , unresected lung cancer follow histologic type : *squamous cell carcinoma , *adenocarcinoma , *undifferentiated large cell carcinoma , *non-small cell , otherwise specify ( NOS , diagnosis cytology alone ) - AJC Stage I-III disease ( detectable tumor encompass radiation therapy field , include primary tumor involve regional lymph node ) ; patient positive supraclavicular node ( N3 ) eligible . - Age &gt; 18 Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 - Measurable disease CT PET image - Patient must deem eligible radical combined-modality therapy - All patient must sign study-specific informed consent form . Ineligibility Criteria : - M1 disease - Karnofsky performance status &lt; 70 age &lt; 18 - Patients undergone complete tumor resection - Patients post-resection intrathoracic tumor recurrence - Evidence small cell histology - Prior concurrent malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer ( unless disease-free least 5 year ) - Prior radiotherapy thorax neck - Prior chemotherapy - Patients myocardial infarction within precede 6 month symptomatic heart disease , include angina , congestive heart failure uncontrolled arrhythmias - Pregnant woman ; patient childbearing potential must practice appropriate contraception . - Inability maintain state deep inspiratory breath-hold minimum length time Statistical Analysis : In previous study compare DIBH-gated CT-scanning free-breathing CT-scanning perform institution , find sample size 10 patient appropriate illustrate statistically significant reduction PTV statistically significant reduction V20 ( volume lung treat dose =20Gy ) . For current study , give patient population essentially last one , fact PET CT comparable image modality NSCLC term sensitivity , total sample size 10 patient would appropriate number assess difference breath-held PET free-breathing PET ( i.e . first objective ) . This difference , term PTV NTCP , assess statistical significance pair Student 's t-test .</detailed_description>
