	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High BP major health problem , contribute high level morbidity mortality . Elevated BP level major risk factor stroke , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , kidney disease . In United States , stroke rate longer improve CHF kidney failure rate continue increase . Despite availability effective treatment , 25 % individual high BP able control effectively . The reason poor BP control vary ; however , predominant reason poor adherence medication instruction life-style modification recommendation . This study address two source poor BP control real world , multifaceted approach . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study compare nurse-administered tailored program home BP monitoring program evaluate impact program BP control . The 5-year randomized control study take place primary care set enroll individual high BP . The nurse-administered program base principle Health Decision Model design increase awareness , yet easily integrated participant 's medical care enhance adherence prescribe treatment . The use home BP monitor find associate increase self management , medication adherence , improve BP control . Five hundred seventy individual high BP two primary care clinic randomly assign receive either nurse-administered program , home BP monitoring program , program , regular medical care . Based initial assessment , participant assign nurse-administered program involve behavioral education telephone program promote medication adherence . This program include support , reminder , information risk high BP , health behavior , patient/doctor communication , literacy , side effect . Participants receive continuous education monitor supported enhance medication adherence . Participants assign home BP monitor record BP every day mail result study physician . The primary outcome whether participant 's BP great 140/90 mm Hg ( non-diabetic individual ) great 130/85 mm Hg ( diabetic individual ) 6-month interval 24 month ( 5 total measurement ) . Descriptive statistic compute study variable stratify treatment group . Because participant may different number measurement , study physician model response evaluate program use mixed effect model dichotomous outcome . Based upon preliminary data , study improve participant ' management high BP , decrease health care utilization , subsequently improve BP control . Additionally , subset ( n=250 ) enrol randomize either nurse administer program usual care evaluate separately program 's effect primary ( blood pressure control ) secondary outcome measure ( change hypertension risk perception , satisfaction care , patient confidence follow recommended regimen , self-reported adherence recommend regimen . ) Masking open label .</detailed_description>
