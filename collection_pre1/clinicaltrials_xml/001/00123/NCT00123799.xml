	<brief_summary>Breast cancer affect many woman . One place spread lymph gland arm . The type treatment offer patient often depend whether lymph gland cancer . For reason , standard recommendation woman breast cancer lymph glands remove surgery . This cancer cause side effect include numbness , pain , decrease ability move arm arm swelling . A new type surgery look first gland cancer drain ( sentinel node biopsy ) may help avoid remove gland arm . Also , new way image gland arm call Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scanning may also give good idea chance glands cancer . This study determine whether PET scan surgery sentinel node biopsy decrease need complete axillary dissection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FluGlucoScan ) Patients With Breast Cancer : Correlation With Histologic Findings Sentinel Node Biopsies Axillary Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 Introduction Breast cancer common cancer North American woman . It estimate one 8 American woman develop breast cancer lifetime . Surgical treatment evolve radical mastectomy breast conservation , systemic treatment become increasingly important . The presence absence lymph node metastases important prognostic factor use determine type systemic treatment necessary . Axillary dissection however , carry risk nerve injury , lymphedema , decrease arm motion seroma formation . Clinical examination , ultrasound , CT scan MRI axilla sensitive specific enough eliminate need axillary dissection . Sentinel node biopsy ( SNB ) predict pathologic status axilla theoretically could differentiate patient positive node biopsy require full dissection versus negative . Frozen section sentinel node inaccurate therefore SNB positive patient would require two surgical procedure . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan axilla report high sensitivity specificity use prior surgery may guide surgeon determine need full axillary dissection versus SNB alone . PET scan also report identify unsuspected distant metastasis find standard stag examination . This study investigate use PET scan conjunction SNB result modality correlate histologic result axillary dissection . 2.0 Objectives There report describe result similar study . By perform properly construct clinical trial T1 - 3 N0 breast cancer patient , question whether PET scan make difference patient management answer . The hypothesis study therefore , PET scan prior surgery facilitate stag locally ( axilla ) distant help surgeon determine whether SNB axillary dissection . 2.1 Primary Objective : To determine whether preoperative PET imaging combine sentinel node biopsy accurately identify nodal status . This would important patient negative PET scan negative sentinel node . If combination test find high negative predictive value nodal metastasis , full axillary dissection could avoid . 2.2 Secondary Objectives : - Assess pattern lymph node drainage use lymphoscintigraphy . - Assessment size limitation PET scan metastatic lymph node . - Assessment primary tumor size evidence multifocality compare preoperative imaging ( mammography +/- ultrasound ) . - The incidence unsuspected distant metastasis frequency treatment change result PET scan would also determine . 3.0 Materials Methods 3.1 Patient Population : Pre post menopausal woman clinical T1-3 N0 breast cancer eligible . All biopsy prove breast carcinoma . Positive core fine needle aspiration biopsy obtain patient . Core biopsy prefer . Excisional biopsy allow . Patients must pregnant lactating must prior malignancy . Diabetic patient ineligible . An informal survey 8 patient Calgary indicate 8 would willing travel Edmonton PET scan . ( Personal communication Dr. Mews ) . 3.2 Preoperative Imaging : All patient preoperative mammography +/- ultrasound breast . Patients eligible consent study refer Cross Cancer Institute surgeon preoperative PET scan . Imaging complete within seven day prior surgery . Once PET scanner become available Calgary , scan do . Potential site distant metastasis identify PET scan image necessary , possible biopsy obtain confirm diagnosis . 3.3 Surgery : Dr. Kelly Dabbs Edmonton Dr. Daphne Mew Calgary surgeon involve . They prove experience SNB 's . At time surgery , sentinel node biopsy use blue dye colloid perform followed level I/II axillary dissection . The patient may either segmental resection mastectomy . 3.4 Pathology : The sentinel node assess H &amp; E well immunohistochemistry per standard protocol . Measurements primary tumor size , size axillary metastasis size situ component document . All pathology report Dr. J. Danyluk , Dr. R. Berendt Dr. F. Alexander . 3.5 Outcome Analysis : Patients positive axillary node dissection positive SNB and/or PET consider true positive ( TP ) modality . A negative axillary dissection negative PET and/or SNB identify true negative ( TN ) group . A positive axillary dissection negative PET and/or SNB identify false negative ( FN ) subgroup . A negative axillary dissection positive PET and/or SNB identify false positive ( FP ) subgroup . Sensitivity ( TP/TP + FN ) specificity ( TN/TN + FP ) determine . If patient successful sentinel node surgery PET scanning , include analysis individual modality successful . 3.6 Statistics : In order adequate number node positive patient test sensitivity overall total 240 patient require . The proportion patient node positive estimate 0.35 . A sample 240 expect contain 84 node positive patient probability least 72 240 patient node positive 0.95 . The subsample 72 node positive patient sufficient perform one-sided test equivalence target sensitivity 0.80 allowable difference 0.10 significance level 10 % power 80 % .The 168 node negative patient 240 total permit one-sided test equivalence target specificity 0.95 allowable difference 0.05 significance level 5 % power 90 % .43</detailed_description>
