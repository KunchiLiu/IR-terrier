	<brief_summary>The purpose early Phase II multicenter trial determine objective clinical response GPX-100 , anthracycline similar doxorubicin , 40 patient newly diagnose metastatic breast cancer . GPX-100 unique among anthracyclines convert doxorubicinol metabolism body . This metabolite show major cause damage heart ( cardiotoxicity ) laboratory study . Eligible patient enrol study receive GPX-100 single agent begin many 8 three week long cycle chemotherapy . Objective measurement tumor response make compute tomography ( CT ) scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design - Two-stage , multicenter , open-label , non-randomized study intravenous ( IV ) dose administration GPX-100 limit dose-escalation de-escalation . After confirmation maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) interim analysis efficacy safety ( Stage I ) , necessary study cohort enlarge confirm estimate clinical efficacy ( Stage II ) use establish MTD . Sample Size - 20 patient Stage I 20 patient Stage II . Dosage Form - IV solution sterilize lyophilized powder Sodium Chloride ( NaCl ) Injection , USP ( 0.9 % ) . Doses - 140 mg/m2 GPX-100 escalation 170 mg/m2 de-escalation 105 mg/m2 depend upon clinical response toxicity . Administration - One IV infusion every 3 week 8 dos . Efficacy Parameters - Activity GPX-100 evaluate term measurable tumor response disease progression accord RECIST criterion . Blood sample obtain determination pharmacokinetic parameter presence doxorubicinol follow first dose GPX-100 . Safety Parameters - Dose tolerance treatment toxicity , especially cardiotoxicity , GPX-100 evaluate . A baseline medical history include Karnofsky Performance Status physical examination , hematology profile ( CBC , differential , platelet count ) , chemistry profile include electrolyte , serum calcium , liver renal function test , urinalysis , chest abdominal CT scan , bone scan do . Interval history adverse event ( AE ) assessment performance status , physical examination , hematology clinical chemistry profile repeat every 3 week treatment . In addition , hematology chemistry profile repeat weekly treatment visit . Chest abdominal CTs bone scan repeat 6-week interval appropriate tumor assessment . An MRI brain perform baseline visit clinically indicate . Urinalysis repeat six-week interval treatment . Cardiotoxicity assess ECG MUGA scan baseline , every 6 week treatment , 6-8 week last dose GPX-100 . There continued follow-up 6-8 week interval indicate change cardiac function normal stable . Treatment discontinue objective disease progression unacceptable treatment toxicity . A follow-up visit occur 6-8 week last treatment visit patient , whether study complete per protocol patient discontinues study treatment early reason . The following evaluation perform follow-up visit : physical examination , adverse event assessment , ECG , MUGA scan , hematology clinical chemistry profile , urinalysis . Serum pregnancy test perform baseline follow-up visit , necessary .</detailed_description>
