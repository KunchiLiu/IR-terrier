	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) increasingly recognize condition characterize dysphagia , food impaction obstructive esophageal symptom child young adult . The pathophysiology EE appear allergy/atopy mediate disease . A personal family history allergic disease ( food allergy , atopic dermatitis , asthma , allergic rhinitis conjunctivitis ) note 62-85 % patient EE . The rise incidence EE may relate worldwide allergy asthma epidemic . Current treatment EE direct decrease esophageal allergic inflammation . Oral topical corticosteroid , cromolyn sodium , montelukast elemental/elimination diet show effective . However , none treatment direct specific pathophysiologic mechanism EE significant side effect . The share pathogenetic mechanism EE asthma suggest therapeutic strategy direct asthma may also effective EE . Specifically targeted allergic immune mechanism involve asthma may effective . Omalizumab recently develop anti-IgE antibody show decrease use inhale oral corticosteroid , reduce frequency asthma exacerbation , improve asthma relate symptom patient allergic asthma . The objective study determine efficacy omalizumab treatment eosinophilic esophagitis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Treatment Eosinophilic Esophagitis With Omalizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dual-center double-blind , placebo control trial omalizumab treatment EE . Omalizumab dose depend patient 's body weight baseline IgE level . Omalizumab placebo administer subcutaneously every 4 week 16 week . At study entry subject EGD biopsy perform ensure diagnosis obtain tissue histologic analysis . No dilation perform time . Baseline validate questionnaire dysphagia , GERD , atopy also administer . Blood drawn baseline serum test . Repeat questionnaires rating overall symptom improvement administer 4 week interval rest study period . At end 16 week period , repeat endoscopy perform biopsy take . Esophageal dilation may perform clinically indicated time . Blood also draw repeat serum testing .</detailed_description>
