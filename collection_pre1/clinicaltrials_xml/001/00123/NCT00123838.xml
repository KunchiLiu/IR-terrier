	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate non-ionizing electromagnetic method align prostate treatment site radiation therapy monitor position throughout radiation therapy delivery . The clinical study involve use investigational device , Calypso速 4D Localization System , require permanent implantation three small sensor call Beacon速 transponder prostate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal prostate radiation therapy give high dose radiation prostate minimal dose healthy tissue around prostate . It well know prostate move slightly within pelvis position varies millimeter day day . There several method use position body prostate accurately begin radiation therapy session . One standard method permanently implant small marker ( gold spheres cylinder ) prostate use x-rays radiation therapy treatment room determine whether marker correct position . If marker correct position , assumption prostate also correct position . If marker correct position x-ray , table patient lie shift marker right place . In study Beacon速 transponder use place standard gold marker . During radiation therapy visit , patient position treatment room correct use Beacon transponder investigational system , call Calypso速 4D Localization System . The Calypso system consist flat panel , place pelvis connect computer , monitor position Beacon transponder within prostate . During five radiation therapy appointments one extra visit , position marker prostate confirm x-ray . The Beacon transponder small glass cylinder contain tiny electrical circuit . The glass vial completely seal separate internal component ( i.e. , electrical circuit ) rest body . The glass vial approximately one-third one inch long one-tenth one inch diameter . Three Beacon transponder implant prostate . They permanently implant .</detailed_description>
