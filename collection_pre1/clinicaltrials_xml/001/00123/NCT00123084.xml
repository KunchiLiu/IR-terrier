	<detailed_description>This research project design look various area function , speech , voice , swallow , related communication behavior body movement individual idiopathic Parkinson disease ( PD ) investigate two different form speech therapy affect area . We ask 620 individual participate study several different way . Specifically , experimental group ( ExpG ) , questionnaire group ( QG ) communication partner group ( CPG ) . The ExpG compose individual PD healthy age gender match control ( HC ) ( Up 140 total ask , 80 expect complete study ) . The QG include significant others , family member , friend ExpG ( Up 140 ask , 80 expect complete study ) . The CPG make friend ExpG ( Up 340 ask , 240 expect complete study ) .Some individual ExpG may pass initial screening . As result , QG CPG long need participate . Therefore , actual number individual complete study expect much less . There 10 PHASES study . The initial PHASES ( 1,2,3 ) screening PHASES determine individual good candidate study . PHASES 4 , 6 10 PHASES record data PHASE 5 treatment . PHASES 7 , 8 9 additional assessment . The total duration Subjects ( Ss ) participation time Ss sign consent completion last phase ( PHASE 10 ) approximately10 month . PHASE 1 : ENT/CLINICAL VOICE AND SPEECH SCREEN PHASE 2 : SWALLOW SCREEN AND ASSESSMENT PHASE 3 : THINKING SKILLS SCREEN AND ASSESSMENT After completion PHASES 1-3 , research team look data collect determine Ss meet criterion participate study . If ask participate , Ss assign one four group continue PHASE 4 . PHASE 4 : INITIAL DATA RECORDINGS All procedures PHASE 4 do two time treatment PHASE 5 . Each record take approximately 2-2.5 hour . PHASE 5 : TREATMENT PHASE 6 : POST TREATMENT PHASE DATA RECORDINGS PHASE 7 : FOLLOW-UP ENT EVALUATION PHASE 8 : FOLLOW-UP SWALLOW EVALUATION PHASE 9 : FOLLOW-UP THINKING SKILLS EVALUATION PHASE 10 : 6-MONTH POST TREATMENT PHASE DATA RECORDINGS</detailed_description>
