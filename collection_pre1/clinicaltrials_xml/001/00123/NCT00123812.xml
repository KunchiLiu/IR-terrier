	<brief_title>Frequency Portal Images Required Enhance Quality Assurance Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : To determine verification film ( port film ) take accepted correct begin course radiotherapy adequate ensure accurate position treatment delivery 4-5 week course radiotherapy breast cancer patient . Secondary : - To assess feasibility line portal imaging breast cancer radiotherapy treatment . - To possibly identify patient population verify daily line portal imaging . DISCUSSION : Quality assurance important aspect radiotherapy delivery . There many facet quality assurance basic concept ensure radiation deliver correct target area . At start course radiotherapy treatment standard Cross Cancer Institute confirm correct area treat . This do take x-ray treatment unit patient treatment position ( portal image verification film ) . This portal image examine treat oncologist compare simulation film digitally reconstruct radiograph generate patient simulate ( set ) radiotherapy treatment . Some alteration may suggest oncologist portal film deem reflect original set-up - routine verification perform . It assume treatment set-up accurate remainder treatment . Numerous change may occur patient undergoes 4-5 week course RT . The patient may relax treatment , patient lose weight , surgical change settle , alter original set . There data determine often set verify . Ideally checked daily prior treatment initiation . This do line portal image however resource currently allow line portal imaging every patient . By evaluate impact weekly portal image investigator may able identify population patient would benefit frequent portal image patient would benefit daily line portal image , allow appropriate resource allocation . Currently Canada , Cross Cancer Institute , treatment many woman breast cancer involve radiotherapy . There complex process take place order plan radiation therapy patient commence treatment . In many circumstance investigator use computerized technology assist planning treatment . This allow precision deliver treatment desire area avoid area normal tissue . Once plan process complete , investigator place mark marker pen skin patient outline area radiation deliver . The investigator confirm correct area treat x-ray take treatment unit treatment position . This call port film verification film . The investigator compare set computerized data . If information match , patient treat full course radiation , assumption treatment give correct position . No check do . The standard radiotherapy center patient treatment position verify weekly portal film . At Cross Cancer Institute investigator begin treatment . No information available confirm necessity frequent verification film , view complex nature investigator ' treatment delivery , may necessary confirm accuracy treatment often . Over course 4-5 week treatment investigator know patient may lose weight , become relaxed day , trouble range movement shoulder ; factor influence position patient . Measurements take treatment unit often change course patient treatment , verification perform ensure treated area still initially intend . STUDY DESIGN : This single institute pilot project . PATIENT CRITERIA/SAMPLE SIZE : Any breast cancer patient receive course radiotherapy treat breast , chest wall and/or regional lymph node . One-hundred consecutive consenting patient analyze prospectively . Patients stratify per treatment area : breast , breast plus regional node , chest wall chest wall plus regional node . The treatment technique also evaluate . METHODOLOGY : Patients eligible consent sequentially select undergo standard radiotherapy planning process initial verification film . In addition standard initial verification film , patient additional verification film take weekly . These review treat radiation oncologist data form complete . The treatment record also examine change note therapist course radiotherapy record . No additional amount radiation give patient . The amount radiation require take verification film subtract amount radiation deliver time treatment . The data compile compare establish relationship target volume ( breast , breast plus regional node , chest wall chest wall plus regional node ) technique use acceptability rate accuracy verification film .</detailed_description>
