	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause activity limitation among old adult United States . NeuroMuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) use stroke survivor enough residual movement take part volitional active repetitive movement therapy require expensive equipment skilled personnel . Two type NMES available . The first cyclic NMES , electrically activate paretic muscle set duty cycle preset time period . ( This study employ `` traditional '' cyclic stimulation `` sensory-only '' stimulation , intensity set level felt patient insufficient cause muscle contraction . ) In cyclic NMES , patient passive participant assist NMES volitionally contract muscle stimulation . The second type encompass various form NMES combination biofeedback . For example , `` EMG-triggered '' NMES , subject `` reward '' stimulation response successful attempt reach pre-set level EMG activity affect muscle . There increased cognitive input involvement part patient . The purpose study first demonstrate effectiveness two type surface stimulation decrease motor impairment activity limitation ; study also seek assess effect add cognitive input NMES reduce motor impairment activity limitation . Study subject acute stroke survivor . They participate total eight month , begin within first six month stroke . Subjects randomly assign one three treatment group receive stimulation accordingly : 1 ) Cyclic stimulation ; 2 ) Sensory-only stimulation ; 3 ) EMG-triggered stimulation . Members treatment group give appropriate NMES device use two 40-minute treatment session per day , five time per week eight week ; total 80 treatment session . Stimulation apply ECR EDC ( wrist finger extensor ) affect arm . A treatment therapist visit patient home weekly basis monitor subject compliance provide feedback device usage . The primary outcome measure upper extremity portion Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ( FMA ) , measure motor impairment . The modified Arm Motor Ability Test ( mAMAT ) hemiparetic arm-specific measure activity limitation , serve secondary outcome measure . In addition baseline visit day enrollment , subject complete outcome measurement clinic five occasion : mid-treatment ( week 5 ) ; end treatment ( week 9 ) ; follow-up visit one- , three- six-months post-treatment .</detailed_description>
