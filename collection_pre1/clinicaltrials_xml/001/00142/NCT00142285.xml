	<brief_title>Zinc Pneumonia Outpatient Trial Children &lt; 2 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow early study among hospitalised child less two year old severe pneumonia administer zinc adjuvant along standard antimicrobial agent . That study find 20 % reduction illness duration hospitalisation , well 3 - 9 fold reduction treatment failure child give zinc along standard antimicrobial management . However , since pneumonia manage outpatient setting , important know work set well . We hypothesise zinc may act acute phase reactant early stage outpatient non-severe pneumonia reduce duration illness likelihood treatment failure . To test , randomise child less two year old receive either zinc placebo adjuvant standard oral antimicrobial agent acute treatment non-severe pneumonia outpatient urban setting . Oral antibiotic give standard five-day course , zinc ( 20 mg ) placebo administer once-daily 10 day . Patients follow daily basis home monitor progress document compliance . Outcomes comparison zinc placebo group duration illness , measure specific sign pneumonia , treatment failure , measure change antibiotic hospitalisation failure improve worsen condition .</detailed_description>
