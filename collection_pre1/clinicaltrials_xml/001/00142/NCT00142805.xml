	<brief_title>Ketasyn Mild Moderate Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial scientific evidence show defect glucose metabolism occur Alzheimer 's disease . Attempts compensate reduce cerebral metabolic rate AD met success . Treatment AD patient high dos glucose insulin raise cognitive score . However , effect slight , high dos insulin adverse consequence . Administration ketone body metabolic precursor medium chain triglyceride ( MCTs ) present attractive alternative glucose insulin . In preliminary study , Ketasyn™ , MCT , demonstrate pharmacological activity statistically significant efficacy improve short-term memory attention performance single dose . Participants randomize receive either Ketasyn™ match placebo , administer day mix powder glass liquid . The treatment period last 90 day , follow 2-week washout period . Each patient see 5 time : screening , baseline , post-baseline day 45 , 90 , 104 . The visit include physical and/or neuropsychological examination , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) laboratory test .</detailed_description>
