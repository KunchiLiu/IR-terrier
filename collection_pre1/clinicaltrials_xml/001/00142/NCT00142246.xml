	<detailed_description>Although risk malaria greatest early childhood , significant number schoolchildren remain risk malaria-specific morbidity mortality . Each year 20-50 % schoolchildren , age 10-14 year , live malaria-endemic area experience clinical attack malaria ( Clarke et al. , 2004 ) . Malaria account 3-8 % all-cause absenteeism school , 50 % preventable absenteeism ( Brooker et al. , 2000 ) . In addition , asymptomatic parasitaemia contributes anaemia , reduce concentration learn classroom ( Holding &amp; Snow , 2001 ) . Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) deliver school simple intervention , readily integrate broad school health programme . This study seek examine whether IPT reduce malaria anaemia amongst school-going child , consequent impact school performance , order ass suitability inclusion standard intervention school health programme . The efficacy IPT evaluate schoolchildren high-level acquire immunity ability limit parasite growth , infection asymptomatic may go untreated . The intervention : Intermittent preventive treatment malaria administer school term purpose reduce asymptomatic parasitaemia prevent clinical attack , thereby reduce anaemia school absenteeism , consequence improve attendance concentration class . Schools randomly allocate one two arm : - Intervention school : IPT give three time year ( per term ) + mass treatment anthelminthic - Control school : mass treatment anthelminthic Mass treatment anthelminthic carry study school twice annually accordance national policy .</detailed_description>
