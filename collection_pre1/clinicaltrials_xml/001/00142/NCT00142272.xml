	<brief_summary>The study conduct compare efficacy safety single dose ciprofloxacin oral suspension 20 mg/kg 3-day course erythromycin oral suspension administer dose 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hour ( 12 dos ) treatment child , age 2-15 year clinically severe cholera due V. cholerae O1 O139 . We hypothesize single dose ciprofloxacin would result similar outcome clinicalcurewith erythromycin give multiple dos .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patient admit Clinical Study Ward Dhaka Matlab Hospitals ICDDR , B . Upon admission , weight ( dehydrated weight ) vital sign record , thorough physical examination , include assessment dehydration ( follow WHO guideline ) , make . Patients rehydrated use intravenous Dhaka Solution ( 133 , 13 , 98 48 mmol/l sodium , potassium , chloride bicarbonate , respectively ) 3-4 hour . Thereafter , observe 4-hour Observation Period hydration maintain use rice-based oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) ( contain 3.5 , 2.5 , 1.5 50 gram/l sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate , potassium chloride rice powder ) . Dhaka Solution , use initial rehydration , use patient whose hydration maintain rice-based ORS.Patients stool output 20 ml/kg Observation Period , V. cholerae demonstrate dark-field microscopic examination freshly pass stool sample , enrol upon obtain write informed consent parent guardian . If possible , assent must obtain child . Patients randomly assign receive one two treatment regimen . Children hospitalise 5 day , initiation study drug resolution diarrhoea , whichever longer , ask return follow-up evaluation 10 14 day study entry . Patients return follow-up visit 4 6 week ( Day 28 Day 42 ) .Patients develop joint change therapy , follow-up period , must follow . Any new objective finding note clinical joint gait assessment thoroughly evaluate investigator . This evaluation may include diagnostic procedure , MRI and/or joint fluid assessment , appropriate . Patients joint change therapy , follow-up period , follow : ) The adverse event resolve orb ) Until change patient ’ condition unlikely final causality assessment make . This may shorter long 3 month time discharge.Medical history obtain thorough physical examination perform daily . Vital sign intake/output record maintain initiation rehydration.Patients closely monitor bacteriological laboratory assessment . Blood , urine stool specimen take various time point . Stool culture enteric pathogens do initiation study drug , study Day 3 follow-up visit . Rectal swab culture V. cholerae do day study hospitalisation period , follow-up ( 10 14 day 4 6 week ) . Complete blood count , serum electrolyte creatinine , total bilirubin , SGPT alkaline phosphatase determine initiation study drug study Day 5 . ( If baseline creatinine &gt; 200 mcmol/L , creatinine also determine 24 hour post-administration first dose study medication , patient creatinine &gt; 200 mcmol/L consider suffer renal failure withdrawn trial . ) If possible , urinalysis do initiation drug therapy Day 5 study . Serum concentration ciprofloxacin determine first day study various time interval first dose study drug .</detailed_description>
