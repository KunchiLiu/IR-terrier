	<brief_summary>The purpose study find 3 % hypertonic saline ( salt-water solution ) give vein improves headache may cause concussion . 3 % hypertonic saline may also improve symptom may cause concussion ( example : confusion , nausea , vomit ) . This research do previous experience suggest 3 % hypertonic saline beneficial treatment child severe brain injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A concussion formally describe clinical syndrome characterize immediate transient change brain function include alteration mental status level consciousness , result mechanical force trauma . Despite prevalence , pathophysiology remain mystery spectrum clinical presentation . A concussion , sometimes describe mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , often present initial loss consciousness , change behavior , confusion , amnesia , aphasia result Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) less normal . As time initial injury lengthens , symptom progressively worsen new symptom vomit headache also develop . Usually , evidence significant intracranial injury compute tomography ( CT ) imaging symptom often improve gradual progression towards normal neurologic baseline ; fact , risk complication population rare . The time improvement varies greatly occur period ranging hour day . During transient time , patient often uncomfortable due persistent headache , inability tolerate oral intake due nausea and/or vomiting , confusion , episodes amnesia . In instance , combative behavior patient difficult tolerate family medical staff . Just symptom cause concussion vary greatly presentation duration , theory behind pathophysiology mild TBI . The transient loss cerebral function head injury formally differentiate severe head injury first time Persian physician Rhazes 900 AD since cause much speculation vary clinical description throughout history . It take another 500 year `` commotion '' shake brain theorize responsible clinical sign . Presently , exact cause concussive symptom continue remain enigma ; major question however , whether concussion due less degree diffuse structural change see severe traumatic brain injury , fact mechanism cause reversible functional change neuron axon . Animal model demonstrate altered metabolic profile brain tissue resolve within hour initial insult . Other animal model demonstrate change integrity microvascular endothelium TBI . It hypothesize area `` microcontusion '' pericontusional edema maybe responsible alteration brain chemistry may ultimately lead clinical symptom associate mild TBI . Multiple study theorize direct indirect effect trauma cerebral vasculature may lead vasoconstrictive phenomenon may responsible postconcussive symptom . Currently , management patient mild traumatic brain injury include observation symptomatic therapy include analgesia without obscure neurologic exam ( acetaminophen ) antiemetic measure ( ondansetron ) . While many patient often discharge home initial evaluation Emergency Department , admit hospital supportive care . The symptom may resolve period hour day . There substantial retrospective data limit prospective data child suggest hypertonic saline ( HTS ) improve control intracranial pressure ( ICP ) patient acute brain injury . In 1992 , report publish Journal Neurosurgical Anesthesiology indicate HTS reduce elevate ICP child head injury . This study look single intravenous bolus HTS comparison volume normal saline demonstrate clear difference . Subsequently , demonstrate HTS appear efficacious control ICP . In retrospective chart review , 68 child close head injury care use standardize protocol intravenous infusion 3 % HTS quantity design drive serum sodium level would reduce ICP le 20 mmHg . Of patient HTS use , 3 patient ( 4 % ) die uncontrolled ICP . Of note , adverse effect super-physiologic hyperosmolarity renal failure , pulmonary edema , central pontine demyelination . The use 3 % hypertonic saline traumatic brain injury recently investigate many center include first tier therapy management decrease intracranial pressure ( ICP ) secondary severe traumatic brain injury pediatric population . Its mechanism ICP reduction lie favorable rheologic osmolar gradient effect ; concomitantly augment intravascular volume increase mean arterial pressure provide optimum cerebral perfusion pressure . Again , multiple study show direct effect HTS lowering ICP along safety pediatric population . HTS also use treat alter mental status diabetic ketoacidosis . Many symptom associate mild traumatic brain injury may due mild elevation intracranial pressure , minimal cerebral edema , and/or vasospasm cerebral vasculature . Hypertonic saline may instrumental improve symptom concussion address commonly suspect mechanism responsible symptom . By reduce mild cerebral edema and/or improve cerebral perfusion pressure , cerebral vasospasm may overcome reversal improve flow ; thus , 3 % HTS may allow favorable treatment postconcussive symptom .</detailed_description>
