	<detailed_description>Recent prevalence estimate cognitive dysfunction MS fall high 54-65 % ,21 impairment document cognitive realm attention , executive control , work memory , episodic memory . Deficits long-term episodic memory MS major complaint patient , note significant contributor disability numerous researchers.4,15,18 While early study memory function MS suggest memory impairment due difficulty retrieval information long term storage,19,26 recent study challenge conclusion . Specifically , research KMRREC clearly show verbal memory impairment MS primarily function poor acquisition information , rather retrieval failure.6,7,8 MS subject require trial learn amount information healthy control subject . However , learn occur , MS healthy control group comparable recall 30-minutes , 90-minutes , 1-week time period ( Appendix B ) .6,7,8 Given apparent deficit acquisition new information impact deficit individual 's quality life , amelioration deficit critical . The treatment memory deficit focus research numerous neurological population , yet receive little attention MS.17 Although multiple author highlight need cognitive rehabilitation technique MS,24,16 exist cognitive rehabilitation program aim improve attentional deficits,23 communication skill , 13 memory new learn within MS.1,2,14 In addition , study examine use cognitive enhance medication treat cognitive deficit MS. Greene colleague ( 2000 ) conduct 12-week trial Donepezil treatment cognitive symptom MS , note medication useful population . Yet medication trial accomplish . Modafinil psychostimulant medication , FDA approve treatment Narcolepsy , potential application treatment learn memory dysfunction MS. Two subtypes glutamate receptor channel implicate memory functioning , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) AMPA subtypes . In addition , facilitation glutamatergic transmission show promote long-term potentiation , hypothesize involve encode new memory ( e.g . 3,5 ) . One might therefore expect improvement new learn memory formation manipulation glutamate aspartate receptor . In contrast , facilitation GABA transmission induces amnesia , inhibit GABA transmission enhances information retention . Therefore , inhibition GABA additionally enhance new learn memory functioning . Modafinil accomplish neurochemical effect . Animal study indicate Modafinil significantly increase aspartate glutamate regional level , decrease level GABA inhibition release.20,12,10,22 In addition , Modafinil show exert effect specific brain region , notably study , subregions hippocampus.11 Therefore , application Modafinil MS population impairment new learn potential significantly improve cognitive function population , secondarily improve emotional symptom quality life . Modafinil show quite safe . Headaches common side effect,29,9 common side effect include nausea , vomit , nervousness , anxiety.9 Less common , serious side effect include delusion hallucination , palpitation , chest pain , dyspnea , increase blood pressure , EKG change . 9 Modafinil apply treatment Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , result indicate Modafinil viable treatment alternative Dextroamphetamine ADHD,28 TBI,9 treatment underarousal . Modafinil therefore demonstrate efficacy within patient group neurological impairment . Rammohan et al 25 note 200mg/day Modafinil significantly improve symptom fatigue MS sample tolerate quite well.25 Given Modafinil proven safe , effective treatment arousal fatigue , neurochemical effect likely enhance cognition , seek apply medication treatment cognitive deficit MS. Due fact Modafinil show act glutamate aspartate receptor , specifically influence hippocampus , hypothesize treatment medication result well performance test new learn memory MS sample . Participants : Twenty subject clinically definite MS objectively document new learn impairment include study . Subjects exclude participation presence significant language comprehension deficit . Additional exclusion criterion follow : age great 60 , less 1-month post recent exacerbation , current treatment corticosteroid , significant neurological history aside MS ( e.g . epilepsy , TBI ) , significant substance abuse history document MAST,27 significant psychiatric history ( e.g . Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder , Major Depression ) , non-fluency English language . Procedure : Please see study overview Appendix C. Subjects recruit physician referral MS Clinic UMDNJ Newark , NJ ( see letter support , Appendix D ) . All potential subject undergo initial neuropsychological ( NP ) testing ( Appendix E ) screen study inclusion criterion , namely presence new learn impairment . Subjects enrol current protocol classify impaired new learn memory ability , intact language ability . Such impairment define performance least 1.5 standard deviation ( SD ) mean healthy control sample Open Trial Selective Reminding Test . This test show sensitive deficit new learn ability commonly observe MS . In addition , performance Token Test ( see Appendix D ) must within normal limit . All subject qualify study undergo baseline neuropsychological test document current level function new learn memory ability . Subjects randomly assign either group 1 group 2 . A two-period crossover design use subject randomly assign one two group . Subjects group see physician ( Dr. Greenwald ) ass current neurological status complete EDSS . Group 1 ( n=10 ) first undergo treatment Modafinil ( 200 mg per day morning ) 2 week . They undergo follow-up neuropsychological assessment follow-up EDSS evaluate medication effect . After follow-up evaluation , washout period one week medication administer . Group 1 receive placebo medication 2 week . A second follow-up evaluation conduct follow latter arm study . Group 2 ( n=10 ) follow pattern , receive placebo medication first arm study Modafinil 2nd arm study . Importantly , subject experimenter administer neuropsychological evaluation blind group membership . All subject ask keep precise journal arm study , record time medication take , side effect , activity day , change cognition activity . They encourage contact prescribe physician encounter difficulty . See Table 1 study protocol . A power analysis present Appendix F. Statistical Analyses : A 2 ( group ) x 3 ( test session : baseline , 15 day , 37 day ) repeat measure ANOVA perform . We hypothesize significant interaction time test group . Cognitive performance expect improve 1st 2nd testing session group 1 , mild practice effect document group 2 . Additionally , expect return baseline cognitive function 2nd 3rd NP assessment Group 1 , improvement performance note group 2 due medication effect . No main effect anticipate . A linear regression use examine influence memory performance perception memory ability change depression anxiety various assessment interval . We hypothesize memory improves , depression anxiety level decrease . Additionally , perception memory improves , depression anxiety also decrease .</detailed_description>
