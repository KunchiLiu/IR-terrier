	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy cost-effectiveness three alternative strategy prevention malaria pregnancy epidemic-prone area low transmission East African Highlands . The strategy compare : - intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( IPT-SP ) - insecticide treated net ( ITN ) , - intermittent preventive treatment SP plus ITN In addition main individually-randomised trial , outcome data subsequently also gather pregnant woman whose house spray indoor residual insecticide ( IRS ) part non-randomised district-wide control programme compare impact IRS three intervention arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Susceptibility malaria infection pregnancy severity clinical manifestation determine level pre-pregnancy immunity , depend intensity stability malaria transmission . Most intervention trial prevent malaria pregnancy conduct area intense transmission . The result trial conduct high-transmission area may applicable low transmission area , malaria le frequent risk spontaneous abortion stillbirth high woman parity due lack sufficient malaria immunity . Routine chemoprophylaxis generally recommend area unstable malaria transmission . However , intermittent treatment effective anti-malarial drug may beneficial , especially period malaria transmission . Little work carry amongst pregnant woman live area low unstable transmission Africa . No data available cost-effectiveness malaria control low transmission setting . This study compare efficacy cost effectiveness three preventive strategy control malaria pregnancy low-transmission setting . The study locate Kabale district , highland area SW Uganda . Women attend antenatal care randomise receive either : - intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( IPT-SP ) - insecticide treated net ( ITN ) , - intermittent preventive treatment SP ITN . It hypothesize combined IPT-SP , additional impact ITNs reduce exposure may greatest intensity transmission low . In addition main individually-randomised trial , outcome data subsequently also gather pregnant woman whose house spray indoor residual insecticide ( IRS ) part non-randomised district-wide control programme compare impact IRS three intervention arm . The study aim identify effective intervention strategy suit area characterise low unstable transmission . Research find applicable hypoendemic area East African highland .</detailed_description>
