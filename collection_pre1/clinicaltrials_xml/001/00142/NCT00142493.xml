	<brief_summary>The purpose research understand drug commonly use anesthesia impair memory . We particularly interest whether emotion associate memory influence well drug able block memory . We study four commonly use drugs—propofol , thiopental , midazolam , dexmedetomidine , may slightly differ effect . We also study inactive substance , call placebo , effect . The result study provide information useful understanding memory work , drug affect memory , possibly people n't memory block easily others .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Affective Content Drug Induced Amnesia Episodic Memory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol `` Effect Affective Content Drug Induced Amnesia Episodic Memory '' investigate relationship ability affective ( 'emotional ' ) content modulate formation episodic memory , memory impairment ( 'amnestic ' ) effect several common intravenous anesthetic drug . Because memory modulation affective content appear distinct memory process , underlie question whether drug impair memory via different mechanism differ effect memory modulation . Specifically , objective : ( 1 ) To study influence three GABAergic agent ( thiopental , propofol , midazolam ) one α2-adrenergic agent ( dexmedetomidine ) ability affective content modulate strength episodic memory ; ( 2 ) To study whether subliminal ( 'consciously imperceptible ' ) presentation emotional word influence memory visual stimulus show immediately subliminal presentation . A maximum eighty volunteer receive sub-anesthetic dos one four study drug , placebo , perform visual continuous recognition task ( 'CRT ' ) picture randomly vary affective load . Drug effect affective modulation work early long-term memory behavior examine analyze image recognize CRT . Drug effect affective modulation later long-term memory examine analyze image recognize several hour presentation . In second experiment , emotive non-emotive word subliminally present immediately presentation 'bland ' picture . The ability subliminally present word influence memory examine analyze bland image recognize several hour later . Three hypothesis test : The memory impairment effect GABAergic drug strong memory emotively positive image memory emotively negative image The memory impairment effect dexmedetomidine similar memory emotively positive negative image Recognition memory neutral , non-arousing image great image immediately precede subliminal presentation emotively arouse word precede emotively non-arousing word</detailed_description>
