	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Oxaliplatin , Bevacizumab Radiation Therapy Patients With Biliary Tract Gallbladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two phase study treatment . The first phase patient last 6 week . During phase , oxaliplatin give intravenously week week 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 ; bevacizumab give intravenously every 2 week week 1 , 3 , 5 day 1 , 15 , 29 ; capecitabine administer orally 14 consecutive day ( day 1-14 ) , week capecitabine , follow another 14 day capecitabine ( day 22-35 ) . Radiation therapy give daily 5 day ( Monday-Friday ) per week total 28 treatment . During first phase study follow test perform weekly : physical exam , vital sign , medical history , blood test urine test . After first phase finish patient wait 4 week CT scan , MRCP , blood test physical exam evaluate status disease . Phase two study break two group : 1 ) patient tumor remove prior enter study 2 ) patient enter study advance disease . If patient tumor remove prior enter study , treat 3 study drug radiation 6-week period earlier study . This 6-week regimen repeat twice total 12 week treatment . Patients advanced disease could remove surgery first enter study evaluation test first phase show tumor respond ( reduced size ) resect , surgery remove tumor . Following surgical recovery ( 8-10 week ) treat 3 study drug radiation 6-week period earlier study . This 6-week regimen repeat twice total 12 week study treatment . If evaluation test show patient ' cancer remain stable ( gotten bad well ) treat three study drug radiation 6-week period earlier study . This 6-week regimen repeat twice total 12 week study treatment . During additional 12 week study treatment physical exam , vital sign , medical history , blood test urine testing perform every 3 week . At end study treatment follow evaluation perform : physical exam , vital sign , blood work , CT scan chest abdomen , MRCP , tumor measurement CT scan . These evaluation repeat every 3 month thereafter . Patients remove study disease worsen unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
