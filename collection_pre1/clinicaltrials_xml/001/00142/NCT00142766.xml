	<brief_summary>The purpose two-year project pilot test intervention change sedation management pediatric patient support mechanical ventilation acute respiratory failure pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . While ensure patient comfort integral part pediatric critical care , analgesic sedative use patient population associate injury ; specifically , comfort medication may depress spontaneous ventilation prolong duration mechanical ventilation . Additionally , drug tolerance develops time may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome ( chemical withdrawal ) patient long require sedation . Alternatively , suboptimal comfort management contribute patient breathe synchronously ventilator and/or self-removal breathing tube . Our group develop validate nurse-implemented sedation algorithm ( set specific instruction ) guide titration comfort medication may optimize patient comfort reduce risk under-medication , algorithm need evaluate . We hypothesize pediatric patient manage per sedation protocol experience few day mechanical ventilation patient receive usual care . This research potential revolutionize sedation practice driven synchronize patient need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose two-year project pilot test evaluate intervention change sedation management pediatric patient support mechanical ventilation acute respiratory failure PICU . Rather seek elusive ideal drug , unique nurse-led pilot study focus optimize clinical decision making : ( ) multidisciplinary team education consensus building ; ( b ) multidisciplinary team identification patient 's trajectory illness daily prescribe sedation goal ; ( c ) nurse-implemented sedation algorithm guide titration comfort medication ; ( ) team feedback clinical performance . This intervention model recent sedation clinical practice guideline publish Society Critical Care Medicine address potentially manipulable factor influence extubation failure rate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit . The coordinating center , Children 's Hospital Boston , develop , test currently use sedation algorithm standard care . We pilot intervention two separate previously select PICUs match size organization , academic affiliation volume patient support mechanical ventilation . One PICU randomize receive early intervention first serve control , receive delay intervention . The study design randomize controlled trial delay intervention control hospital . Because intervention educational organizational change direct PICU clinician , unit randomization analysis PICU . During start-up phase , case report form develop consensus meeting nurse physician co-investigators conduct . The purpose consensus meeting review Children 's Hospital Boston experience sedation algorithm reach agreement application two PICUs . System nuance may impact protocol implementation require group discussion multidisciplinary problem solve . Study design include baseline assessment organizational structure comfort practice unit . The PICU randomize early intervention undergo training follow implementation , one-month respite , post-data collection evaluate sustainability practice change . The PICU randomize delay intervention start pre-data collection , undergo training follow implementation . This design allow multiple comparison ; specifically , baseline intervention/control , pre post comparison unit , sustainability one unit . Training multifaceted include clinician ( physician , nurse , clinical pharmacist physicians-in-training ) involve sedation management intubate mechanically-ventilated patient . A multidisciplinary , cooperative approach necessary assure compliance successful implementation protocol . Training material include discipline-specific lecture , informal discussion , video sedation opioid withdrawal scoring , bedside booklet , physician order sheet . The research team develop support material . Physician training focus sedation opioid withdrawal scoring , identify patient 's trajectory illness , collaborate nursing prescribe daily sedation goal , completion standardize order template . Nursing content likewise focus sedation opioid withdrawal scoring , trajectory analysis collaboration , also include practical support daily `` wake-up '' test titration sedative . Prior intervention phase , physician , physician-in-training , unit-based clinical pharmacist , charge nurse full-time nursing staff require document understand intervention completion discipline-specific scenario-based self-assessment evaluation . Respiratory therapist also require refresher instruction extubation readiness test general information sedation assessment sedation algorithm . During implementation phase , daily multidisciplinary round include identification patient 's trajectory illness daily prescription ( ) sedation goal ( b ) sedation parameter . Nurses titrate comfort medication prescribe perform daily `` wake '' test patient stable phase awake . During implementation phase , member research team round separately patient monitor study compliance offer staff support re-training necessary . This level vigilance necessary identify aspect algorithm challenge clinician , accurate report protocol deviation require evaluation context decision-making . This daily check continue early intervention arm sustainability evaluate . During implementation phase , sedation order derive standardized physician order . This order template serve two purpose : physician education enhance compliance algorithm</detailed_description>
