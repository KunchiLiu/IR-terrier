	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine single application Lidocaine gel topical anesthesia effective decrease discomfort associate urinary catheterization two application , within pediatric population . Currently , two application standard care within pediatric Radiology Department . Urinary catheterization process place flexible tube urinary opening ( urethra ) , drain urine instill radiographic solution study anatomy and/or function urinary system . Members study team hypothesize equivalence observer report catheterization pain score measure FLACC pain scale . The study design obtain conclusive data guide clinical practice . The study team hypothesize statistically similar level analgesia observe single application procedure compare multiple application technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Control Trial Comparing Single v . Multiple Application Lidocaine Analgesia Prior Urethral Catheterization Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial design obtain conclusive data guide clinical practice single site study . The study examine variation observer report catheterization pain level pre-treatment occurs either single application technique double application strategy . Two treatment group establish investigation individual assignment either two cohort occur randomization . These two intervention group include ( 1 ) usual care two application ( control group ) ( 2 ) single application ( study group ) . Those patient randomize control group receive one application gel externally one internal application Lidocaine gel internally urethra , five minute apart . The final application occur five minute prior catheterization . The second group patient randomize pre-catheterization analgesia strategy use one internal application five minute prior catheterization . 400 patient two month 7 year age invite participate study . The primary outcome variable cumulative FLACC pain score . The FLACC pain scale simple graph score distress behavior observe pain response child may able rate presence severity pain . One consistent observer utilized provide score pain scale , remain blinded method Lidocaine application child randomize . A Child Life Specialist responsible offer age-appropriate diversion comfort technique procedure . A parental survey complete parent ( ) conclusion study , collect lock survey box .</detailed_description>
