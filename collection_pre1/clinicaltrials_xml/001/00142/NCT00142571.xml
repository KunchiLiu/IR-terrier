	<brief_title>Comparison Gemcitabine v. Gemcitabine Plus Docetaxel Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do well treatment sarcomas need . This phase III study . This mean one treatment compare another find well . We compare drug gemcitabine two drug gemcitabine docetaxel find treatment well people sarcomas . From previous study know gemcitabine cause shrink people 's sarcoma tumor . We also know gemcitabine docetaxel useful sarcomas well , believe two drug together may toxic single drug alone . In study try answer question : `` Is combination gemcitabine docetaxel well gemcitabine alone ? '' This randomized Phase III trial compare two treatment regimen patient unresectable soft tissue sarcoma . The failure rate observe treatment arm ( failure define progression death ) compare determine regimen result low failure rate ( Primary objective ) . As secondary endpoint , percentage patient failure-free ( failure define progression death ) 3 month 6 month compare two arm ( Secondary objective ) . This trial , sponsor North American Sarcoma Study Group Connective Tissue Oncology Society , do number hospital around country expect enroll 120 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven soft tissue sarcoma ( except follow histology : gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , Kaposi 's Sarcoma , mesotheliomas Age &gt; = 10 year Recurrent progressive disease define increase size exist tumor mass , development new tumor mass mass , amenable definitive surgical therapy . Patients may another cancer must convince clinical evidence sarcoma disease require therapeutic intervention . ( ie . Several sarcoma patient prior cancer ( Hodgkin 's disease breast cancer ) treat year previously develop clinically active sarcoma . ) Patients may fail 3 prior chemotherapy regimen . Measurable disease define RECIST . Measurable disease presence least one measurable lesion . If measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology/histology . A measurable lesion one accurately measure least one dimension long diameter &gt; 20 mm use conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % Peripheral neuropathy , present , must &lt; = grade 1 At least 3 week since prior chemotherapy ( 10 day patient imatinib , thalidomide , interferon ) At least 3 week since prior radiation therapy Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 Total Bilirubin &lt; upper limit normal ( ULN ) . ALT ( SGOT ) AST ( SGPT ) &lt; 5 x ULN . Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN . Serum creatinine &lt; equal 2.0 mg/dL Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment reasonable period thereafter ( approximately 3 month ) If patient 18 old , patient must capable provide write , informed consent . If patient young 18 , write voluntary informed consent patient 's parent legal guardian patient 's assent require . Soft tissue sarcoma follow histology : gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , Kaposi 's sarcoma , mesothelioma Active uncontrolled infection ( antibiotic therapy acute chronic infection ) Prior treatment gemcitabine docetaxel Peripheral neuropathy &gt; = grade 2 History know hypersensitivity reaction agent formulate polysorbate 80 , solubilizing agent docetaxel [ e.g . interferon alpha2a , child 's ibuprofen suspension ( Advil ) , terconazole ( Terazol ) , lamivudine ( Epivir ) , etoposide , amiodarone , vaccine ( DtaP , influenza ) , bupropion ( Wellbutrin ) , Vitamins B12 , C+zinc+selenium ] .
