	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Physical inactivity relate many health problem , include increase risk cardiovascular disease , hypertension , cancer . Despite health consequence sedentary lifestyle , 25 percent Americans meet recommended level physical activity . Researchers postulate theory-based intervention effectively influence physical activity behavior change theoretical construct believe important behavior change ( i.e. , potential mediator ) , self-efficacy ( i.e. , confidence one 's ability physically active ) . Unfortunately , previous study generally fail adequately test mediate effect theoretical construct use appropriate statistical mediator analysis recommend lead behavioral scientist statistician . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine mediate effect theoretical construct base Transtheoretical Model ( TTM ) Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) . The study address methodological , measurement , statistical limitation previous study . The investigator randomly assign 420 healthy sedentary individual either theory-based physical activity intervention contact control group . Physical activity behavior potential mediator assess monthly 12 month . They hypothesize construct base TTM SCT ( i.e. , behavioral process , cognitive process , self-efficacy , decisional balance ) mediate relationship group assignment ( intervention vs. contact control ) physical activity behavior , effect intervention physical activity behavior relative contact control group attenuate control mediator . They also examine importance particular mediator different population group ( e.g. , age , gender ) , help create effective intervention group . Finally , conduct cost analysis inform policy maker cost deliver intervention within study also estimate cost delivering component intervention ( i.e. , mediator ) . The analysis estimate cost future refine intervention incorporate active component affect mediator physical activity study . In summary , study identify mediator ( i.e. , theoretical construct ) effective increase physical activity , important public health impact give likely lead efficacious less costly intervention .</detailed_description>
