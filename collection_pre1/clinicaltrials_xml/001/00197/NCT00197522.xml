	<brief_summary>We , researcher Hamilton Health Sciences , develop novel approach cancer therapy use transfected dendritic cell ( DCs ) generate enhance immunity define tumor antigen . Dendritic cell highly specialized antigen present cell find bone marrow , lymph node , skin thymus . Infection DCs Adenovirus ( Ad ) vector incorporate gene define tumor antigen enable intracellular expression major histocompatability complex ( MHC ) -restricted presentation tumor peptide transfected DCs . Given potent immunostimulatory property DCs ability use gene transfer `` load '' DCs tumor antigen , hypothesize administration transduce autologous DCs may potential therapeutic benefit cancer vaccine . We examine Ad-tumor antigen DC base vaccination murine model breast cancer melanoma . In model , injection ( ) Ad-transduced DCs result highly potent immune activation antigen-specific anti-tumor response . In model , high level antigen-specific , cytotoxic effector lymphocytes recognize kill cancer cell directly correlate therapeutic response ( tumor regression and/or complete protection animal subsequently re-challenged tumor cell ) . Animals demonstrate specific vitro immunity protect subsequent injection cancer cell . Moreover , observe complete resolution significant long-term survival animal establish metastatic disease demonstrable toxicity . As opposed vaccination protocol tumor peptide purify epitopes MHC-I restrict ( i.e . HLA-A2 ) , find injection DCs transduce vector express entire tumor antigen result peptide presentation MHC-I MHC-II complex . The subsequent immune response comprise CD4+ CD8+ T cell population . Thus , Ad-based gene transfer tumor antigens appear efficient approach : ( 1 ) enabling sustain endogenous peptide processing , ( 2 ) facilitate DC-specific presentation host immune system . We show use replication deficient adenovirus vector express Her-2/neu DNA control human mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) promoter transfect bone marrow derive DCs ( AdHer2/DC ) . These cell use immunize recipient mouse tumour challenge Her2 transgenic tumour cell . The protection antigen specific ( anti Her2 ) . On basis pre-clinical study initiate pilot trial AdHer2/DC vaccine Her -2/neu overexpressing patient metastatic breast cancer . Long-term goal implication possible result : The goal initial pilot phase I study evaluate safety dose schedule vaccine therapy . The vaccine test subsequent phase II III study determine efficacy comparison standard therapy . The long-term goal eventually test therapy adjuvant breast cancer set Her-2/neu overexpressing patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following write , informed consent , consecutive cohort 3-6 patient , maximum 18 patient , treat increase dose level base modify Fibonacci scheme . Peripheral blood progenitor cell obtain patient follow cytokine mobilization ( GM-CSF G-CSF ) . Selected CD34+ cell culture human GM-CSF , human TNFÎ± , Flt-3 ligand human interleukin-4 . The CD34+ derive dendritic cell transduce adenovirus express rat HER2/neu . These transduce DCs inject intradermally patient . Patients injected AdHER2/neu transduce DCs every 21 day total three treatment cycle . The start dose dendritic cell 10 X 10^6 DCs . If none initial three patient treat dose experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) new cohort three patient treat second dose level 50 X 10^6 DCs . If patient experience DLT six patient treat current dose level ; 2/6 few patient experience DLT , escalate second dose level . If 3 patient experience DLT , maximum tolerate dose deem exceeded second cohort 3 patient treat 10 fold dose reduction initial dose level . The third dose level consist 100 x 10^6 DCs . All treatment occur out-patient setting patient see prior injection monthly least three month follow last injection AdHER2/neu DCs .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients metastatic breast cancer HER2/neu positive ( 3+ immunohistochemistry FISH positive ) either 1. currently receive hormonal therapy candidate 2. consider trastuzumab 3. cancer progress trastuzumab Patients exclude study meet one follow criterion : Age le 16 year . Pregnant lactate female . Previous malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . More three prior course cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic disease . Concurrent use chemotherapy , immunotherapy , gene therapy . Concurrent hormonal therapy ( tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor exemestane ) permit . Treatment trastuzumab within 16 week prior first dose vaccine therapy . Documented central nervous system metastasis . Patients acute illness would interfere mobilization stem cell administration vaccination cellular therapy ( ie . unstable angina , renal liver failure , severe chronic obstructive airway disease ) ineligible . Any patient require concurrent immunosuppressive therapy ( eg . corticosteroid ) Patients life expectancy less six month . ECOG performance status &gt; 2 .</criteria>
