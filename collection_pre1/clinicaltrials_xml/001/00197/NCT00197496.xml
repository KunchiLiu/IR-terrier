	<brief_summary>Achieving independent ambulation important goal hip fracture rehabilitation , predictive return community future health problem . Current research regard post-hip fracture rehabilitation sparse . Body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) novel approach retrain walk ability . BWSTT may ideal retrain walk hip fracture , task-specific alleviates demand maintain balance walk skill train . The use harness may provide sense security patient , facilitate walk training . The propose project investigate feasibility tolerability BWSTT hip fracture , impact function , mobility , quality life fear fall . It hypothesize BWSTT 3-5 time weekly acute hip fracture patient improve function , mobility , quality life reduce fear fall .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morbidity mortality rate associate hip fracture enormous . Current literature regard post-hip fracture rehabilitation sparse . A recent Cochrane review suggest potential enhancing recovery mobility hip fracture patient treadmill gait retrain warrant research area . Body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) novel approach retrain ambulation , successfully implement patient population . BWSTT may ideal retrain gait hip fracture , task-specific alleviates demand maintain equilibrium walk skill train . The objective propose pilot study evaluate feasibility tolerability use BWSTT gait retrain strategy individual experience hip fracture , explore whether improve mobility , fear fall function . Participants ' feedback seek regard BWSTT experience use planning future clinical trial , submit CIHR . Quantitative outcome assess baseline , 4 week train 3-5 time per week . Outcome measure include : Lower Extremity Functional Scale , health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) , Falls-Efficacy Scale 2-minute walk test . Based previous research experience frail elderly , anticipate many patient receptive rehabilitation form BWSTT . We hypothesize BWSTT hip fracture result significant gain ambulatory capacity , well improvement quality life functional independence . In addition , anticipate BWSTT prove feasible effective gait retrain strategy .</detailed_description>
