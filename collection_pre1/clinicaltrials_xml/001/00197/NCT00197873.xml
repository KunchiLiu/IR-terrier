	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , randomize , cross-over , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients diagnose advanced colorectal cancer overt distant metastasis receive chemotherapy consist capecitabine , oxaliplatin bevacizumab , give 3-weekly cycle , randomly assign receive either lactobacillus ( GefilusR ) placebo first 3 cycle chemotherapy ( 9 week ) . Following , group cross study participant allocate lactobacilli receive placebo 9 week , vice versa . Lactobacilli placebo administer twice daily . The total daily dose lactobacillus 20 billion CFU . The primary outcome measure frequency moderate/severe diarrhoea ( grade 2-4 ) . Adverse effect ( include frequency diarrhoea , flatulence , bloating , constipation , nausea ) longitudinally monitor base patient diary study visit . The study also address safety tolerability chemotherapy , response chemotherapy , progression-free survival , resectability liver metastasis , serum growth factor level .
