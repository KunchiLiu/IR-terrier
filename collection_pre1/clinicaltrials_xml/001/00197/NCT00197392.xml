	<brief_summary>The purpose non-significant risk study establish initial baseline infection rate Codman BACTISEAL External Ventricular Drainage ( B-EVD ) System ( Antibiotic impregnate catheter ) compare relative rate ventriculostomy-related infection Subjects BACTISEAL conventional EVD catheter prospective , randomized open label study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Infection Rates Codman BACTISEAL TM External Ventricular Drainage ( EVD ) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>External ventricular drainage catheter widely use management Subjects elevate intra-cranial pressure ( ICP ) secondary acute hydrocephalus due sub-arachnoid hemorrhage , intra-cerebral hemorrhage , intra-ventricular hemorrhage cause obstruct cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) circulation . However , mode treatment could compromise increase risk catheter relate CSF infection . B-EVD manufacture use patented process impregnate silicone catheter two antibiotic , rifampin clindamycin . These antibiotic impregnate throughout silicone matrix . After implantation , slow release antibiotic extra- intra-luminal catheter surface minimize likelihood bacterial colonization . The B-EVD Catheter System , date , well accept domestic European customer . Currently exist sound scientific rationale promise bench-top vitro data anticipate low level ventriculostomy-related infection Subjects use system . Published BACTISEAL shunt data direct feedback U.S. market experience also support notion . There publish clinical study report infection rate use B-EVD System , make statement regard propensity minimize clinical risk catheter-related infection mere speculation anecdotal . Therefore , Codman propose undertake controlled clinical evaluation product demonstrate influence EVD catheter-related infection , use conventional EVD catheter standard reference . Immediately follow successful screening , Subject randomize test control group appropriate EVD system implant . The Treatment Phase cover duration implant EVD system . Subjects monitor 2 week post-explant . This study expect enroll 600 evaluable implanted Subjects 15 Investigational Sites US , Europe Asia-Pacific</detailed_description>

Within precede 30 day , Subject enrol participate another trial utilize antimicrobial drug medical device implant directly influence CNS and/or spinal cord . The Subject pregnant lactating . The Subject suspect documented allergy material EVD system , include silicone , rifampin clindamycin . The Subject positive CSF culture prior EVD implant . The Subject immunocompromised . The Subject require one ventricular catheter concurrently . The Subject EVD catheter within previous 30 day . The Subject sepsis , ventriculitis , meningitis , skin infection/inflammation near implantation site , ear infection either side , severe respiratory tract infection , opinion Investigator , would likely compromise effectiveness EVD system . The Subject know receive systemic antibiotic therapy within 14day period precede screen inclusion trial . The Subject uncontrolled coagulopathy know bleeding diathesis . The Subject otherwise determine Investigator medically unsuitable participation trial . The Subject prisoner .</criteria>
