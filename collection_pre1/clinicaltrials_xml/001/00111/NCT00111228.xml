	<brief_title>The Guardcontrol Trial : Study Assess Type 1 Diabetics Can Improve Using Real-Time Values Guardian RT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Finger-stick base self-testing ( SBGM ) , well diagnostic continuous glucose monitoring ( CGMS® ) allow diabetic patient find balance two hyper- hypoglycemic extreme . Nevertheless , still patient fail achieve good control due fear hypoglycemia , underestimate post-prandial hyperglycemia . The Guardian® RT Telemetered Glucose Monitoring System indicate continuous periodic monitor real-time interstitial blood glucose value low/high blood glucose alarm ( pre-set level reach ) person diabetes mellitus . The glucose value calculate device use trigger hypo- hyperglycemia alert display every 5 minute . The Guardian® RT store 21 day data . The overall primary objective study determine whether patient poor glycemic control evidence HbA1c &gt; 8.1 % achieve improve metabolic control use real-time value Guardian® RT compare conventional self-monitoring blood glucose finger-sticks ( control group ) 12 week continuous use .</detailed_description>
