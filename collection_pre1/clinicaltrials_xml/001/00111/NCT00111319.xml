Symptomatic multiple myeloma asymptomatic multiple myeloma relate organ tissue damage . Asymptomatic multiple myelomarelated organ tissue damage include presence asymptomatic lytic bone lesion plasmacytoma , presence anemia , renal function impairment , hypercalcemia , long criteria pretreatment clinical laboratory value indicate met . Presence measurable disease , define : For secretory multiple myeloma , measurable disease define quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value .
