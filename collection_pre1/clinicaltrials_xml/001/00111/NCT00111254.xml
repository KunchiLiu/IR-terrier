	<brief_title>The Effects Microdermabrasion Skin Remodeling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microdermabrasion rapidly become one popular cosmetic procedure perform dermatologist plastic surgeon . Microdermabrasion process use high-pressure stream aluminum oxide crystal negative pressure superficially peel upper layer skin . Its purported benefit include improvement photoaged skin , acne , facial scarring . The appeal microdermabrasion effectiveness , simplicity , low patient operator risk , rapid recovery . Clinically , study illustrate beneficial effect photodamaged skin . Histologically , microdermabrasion reproducible effect epidermis dermis . Studies show consistent increase epidermal thickness well change elastin content dermis change collagen content observe . The reported clinical histologic change see previous study suggest alteration dermis precipitate epidermal injury may responsible beneficial effect microdermabrasion photoaging scar . In fact , others report skin fibroblast tension may increase collagen synthesis . Disruption epidermal barrier initiate repair process restores barrier function within hour day , depend severity damage . This repair process involve increase synthesis barrier lipid , follow formation new corneocytes . Elevated lipid synthesis largely occur result increase gene expression major enzyme responsible lipid biosynthesis . In study , subject assign one two treatment group . Patients first group hip/buttock forearm treat microdermabrasion machine . There may one treatment many 6 area , space two week apart . The treated area either right leave buttock and/or forearm and/or underarm . An area approximately 10x10 cm ( 4x4 inch ) treat . Skin biopsy perform nine different time , six month follow dermabrasion , treat and/or untreated skin buttock , forearm and/or underarm . Therefore , total ( ) nine biopsy take subject group . The biopsy 4 mm small size , size pencil eraser . Subjects expect make six visit hospital 3-4 week period time . Subjects assign second group face treat microdermabrasion weekly biweekly interval total six treatment . One pair biopsies take prior first treatment , 2nd 3rd pair take two different occasion later 3 month follow final treatment . Thus , maximum number biopsy group II six . The biopsy 2mm punch , `` cookie-cutter '' , biopsies take front ear . Subjects expect make 8-10 visit hospital 2-3 month period time .</detailed_description>
