	<brief_summary>This study may identify gene predict seriousness neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . Finding gene may explain people NF1 medical problem others . The study also examine medical problem NF1 rarely see well understood . Male female patient NF1 go puberty may eligible study , well patient age unique under-recognized disease feature . Affected unaffected family member , include parent , sibling , distant relative , may also enrol . Candidates screen discussion medical history review medical record , . Participants undergo follow procedure : Patients NF1 - Physical examination family history - Photographs iris eye - Photographs back , abdomen thigh count skin tumor - Photographs face body ( underwear ) help track growth appearance - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) spine ( This test use magnetic field radio wave look tumor curvature spine . The patient lie still scanner , narrow cylindrical device , wear earplug muffle loud knock sound occur scan . A contrast material call gadolinium inject vein catheter enhance image . ) - Blood draw genetic study - Possibly skin biopsy ( use numb medicine , removal small sample skin tissue ) grow cell laboratory Patients NF1 unique under-recognized disease feature - Physical examination family history - Blood draw genetic study - Possibly skin biopsy - Possibly additional test , blood work , x-rays , photograph , MRIs , ultrasounds , test Unaffected family member - Blood draw genetic study - Brief skin eye examination - Possibly skin biopsy cell culture Families ask give permission researcher recontact follow-up information , additional blood sample , follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize normal germline variation gene expression account , part , variation clinical severity phenotype monogenic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . The phenotype NF1 constitute variety quantifiable feature ; term feature sub-phenotypes . Our main focus sub-phenotypes publish evidence variation expression inherit component . These include primary sub-phenotype spinal neurofibroma burden ( quantified MRI spinal neurofibroma ) secondary sub-phenotypes dermal neurofibroma burden , head circumference , number Lisch nodule , scoliosis , history plexiform neurofibroma , height . Other sub-phenotypes , collected routine history physical , also evaluate . According hypothesis , severity sub-phenotype correlate heritable difference germline expression certain gene . As example , consider spectrum individual affect primary sub-phenotype spinal neurofibroma burden . For gene , relationship expression level number spinal neurofibroma . However , gene direct ( inverse , ) correlation level expression number neurofibromas . Such gene would consider candidate modifier gene . The secondary sub-phenotypes also analyze similar way . To limit false positive , candidate gene test association ( use transmission/disequilibrium test , TDT ) appropriate sub-phenotype . Recruitment focus identifying individual range severity primary sub-phenotype , spinal neurofibroma burden . We primarily recruit post-pubertal individual meet 1988 NIH criterion neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NIH Consensus Development Conference 1988 ) . We exclude recognize segmental mosaic NF1 . The rate cutaneous neurofibroma growth number know vary widely ; tumor typically appear adolescence . For reason ascertain patient puberty . We expect individual 18 year old , also accept post-pubertal pediatric patient ( use hand film demonstrate bone age ) . Parents ( whether affect ) critical use family-based test association ( like TDT ) test linkage also recruit . Tests association TDT require trio ( mother , father , proband ) . Multiple trio derive single family , multiple affected individual within family . We set recruitment goal 100 trio ceiling 1500 individual ( 500 affect individual , plus 1000 parent additional sib 400 family ) . In interest improving care people live NF1 , protocol also seek characterize , PI discretion , individual unique under-recognized feature NF1 well individual NF1-like phenotype , include patient know suspected RAS pathway disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Group A : All affected individual family postpubertal male female individual meet 1988 NIH criterion neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NIH Consensus Development Conference 1988 ) . Group B : Unaffected individual great 2 year age relatives participant ( especially parent , also sibling ) eligible enroll critical success study . These individual may gender ethnicity . If individual prepubertal , s/he must brief evaluation NIH Clinical Center ( abbreviated medical history skin eye exam ) ensure s/he affected NF1 . Group C : individual unique underrecognized feature NF1 age , gender ethnicity must correct clinical diagnosis NF1 ( NIH Consensus Development Conference 1988 ) . Group C participant enrol study identify physician responsible followup care arrange ( need ) conclusion evaluation NIH . For healthy normal volunteer use MRI image spine , aim recruit one male one female 5 decade ( 1830 year , 3140 year , 4150 year , 5160 year , 6170 year ) . These individual may ethnicity . Additional requirement include : 1 . If female childbearing age , must willing serum pregnancy test ( HCG ) 2 . Willingness undergo brief , focus history physical exam rule occult spine pathology verify contraindication spinal MRI imaging . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GROUP A INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE : 1 . Any history administration ( current use ) radiation therapy , chemotherapeutic agent biologic agent ( experimental ) result documented significant change spinal neurofibroma tumor burden growth . 2 . Any history administration ( current use ) medication might reasonably expect alter natural history tumor growth ( example include pirfenidone , interferon , farnesyl transferase inhibitor ( FTI ) , MTX/VBL , thalidomide , growth hormone ) cause significant change gene expression profile . 3 . Any history surgery significantly debulk spinal neurofibromas 4 . Pregnancy/Lactation . If affect pregnant lactate woman eligible participation , request enroll conclusion pregnancy lactation . 5 . Cognitive delay adult minor extent sedation require obtain MRI . 6 . Presence suspect presence hardware ( Harrington rod ) metallic object ( e.g . shrapnel , aneurysm clip ) history exposure object ( e.g . weld ) preclude MRI imaging . 7 . Inability unwillingness tolerate 1hour ( ) MRI protocol . 8 . Patients exclude travel NIH medical condition OR le 2 year age . The PI may decline enroll patient reason . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GROUP B INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE : 1 ) A nonaffected pregnant lactate woman family LCL immortalization perform may participate . However , member multiaffected family ( thus blood use prepare LCLs ) request donate blood sample conclusion pregnancy upon wean child . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GROUP C INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE : 1 ) Less 2 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY , NORMAL VOLUNTEERS INCLUDE : 1 . Pregnancy lactation ( serum HCG level drawn childbearing age woman ) . Women unwilling serum pregnancy test participate . 2 . Any history spine surgery significant spinal disease ( severe arthritis , autoimmune disorder , severe scoliosis , kyphosis lordosis , cancer , NF1 , NF2 , schwannomatosis ) 3 . Any active spinerelated complaint : e.g . persistent back pain , radicular symptom 4 . Clinically significant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's safety affect his/her MRI ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , chronic hypertension , severe anemia , kidney disease , heart disease [ angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ] ) . 5 . Previous eye surgery kind . 6 . Inability provide inform consent . 7 . Permanent tattooed makeup ( eyeliner , lip , etc ) general tattoo . Subjects tattoos exclude dangerous location body make color ( e.g . dark blue dark green ) whose content iron definitely rule Investigators . 8 . Any nonorganic implant device : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear , otologic , ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( Nitro , hormone ) may cause problem remove even temporarily , metallic implant object , body piercing ( ) , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt . 9 . Cerebral aneurysm clip . 10 . Shrapnel metal imbed subject 's body ( war wound accident ) . 11 . Previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near subject 's eye . 12 . A severe auto accident past uncertain whether metal may still imbed subject 's body . 13 . Any psychological contraindication MRI ( e.g. , suffer claustrophobia ) . This assessed time medical history collect . 14 . Any contraindication study procedures do . 15 . Dental work crown bridge indeterminate metal 16 . The PI may decline enroll patient reason .</criteria>
