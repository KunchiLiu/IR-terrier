	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase II , open-label , roll-over trial evaluate long term safety tolerability TMC125 , administer part individually optimized antiretroviral therapy , HIV 1 infected subject . In addition , antiviral activity immunological effect TMC125 part antiretroviral regimen time , evolution HIV phenotype genotype evaluate . Subjects randomize active control arm sponsor-selected TMC125 trial virologically fail complete entire treatment period , placebo arm treat least 48 may derive benefit TMC125 treatment judge investigator enrol . Based currently select study , maximum 170 subject enrol current trial . A dose 800mg b.i.d . TMC125 ( formulation TF035 ) formulation switch , 200mg b.i.d . ( formulation F060 ) , give combination investigator-selected , optimized underlying therapy start baseline consist least 2 drug ( nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTIs ] and/or allow protease inhibitor [ PIs ] and/or enfuvirtide [ T 20 ] ) 48 week . Tolerability safety assess throughout trial . The efficacy parameter determine defined time point trial . The trial involve screen visit preferable day withdrawal visit sponsor-selected trial , baseline visit , treatment period 48 week , final visit 4 week follow-up period .
