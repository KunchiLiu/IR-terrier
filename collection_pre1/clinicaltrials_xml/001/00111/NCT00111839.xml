	<brief_summary>This study plan answer question drug , matuzumab ( EMD 72000 ) , work part effort aim develop well treatment advanced lung cancer combine matuzumab , monoclonal antibody , chemotherapy treatment , call pemetrexed . Pemetrexed commercially available approve treatment locally advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer could successfully treat chemotherapy . The study aim examine non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) respond matuzumab combination pemetrexed , compare give pemetrexed alone . The study also aim examine safe effective matuzumab long stay body ( pharmacokinetics ) . Matuzumab experimental treatment currently available research study .</brief_summary>
