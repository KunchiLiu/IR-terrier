	<brief_title>Study Home-Based Resistance Strength Training HIV-Infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Testing : Eligible patient test General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Massachusetts General Hospital GCRC Massachusetts Institute Technology ( MIT ) . For woman regular menses , admission correspond early follicular phase . Patients receive menstrual history calendar submit baseline 16 week visit . A complete history physical exam perform , include detailed history drug use treatment HIV disease associate condition . Weight measure express percentage ideal body weight ( IBW ) body mass index . Blood sample determine hormonal function ( testosterone , free testosterone , SHBG , estradiol , LH , FSH ) , nutritional status ( albumin , prealbumin ) , lipid parameter ( HDL , LDL , cholesterol , triglyceride ) , immune function ( CD4 , viral load , CBC ) , thrombolytic marker ( t-PA , PAI-1 ) . An HIV test perform baseline visit , order document patient status . Glucose homeostasis measure use fast glucose insulin level oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Heart rate monitor test cardiovascular function . A spot urine collect bone marker beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( bHCG ) . Lean body mass fat mass determine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [ DEXA ] ( perform MIT CRC ) ; total body water determine bioimpedance analysis ; muscle cross-sectional area determine anthropometric measurement . A quantitative compute tomography ( CT ) scan thigh abdomen do measure visceral subcutaneous fat . A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy calf muscle determination lipid concentration skeletal muscle do . ( Subjects contraindication magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] able remain protocol , MR-Spectroscopy perform ) . A complete dietary assessment rest energy expenditure perform . Quality life assess use MOS HIV questionnaire activity questionnaire well Karnofsky performance assessment . A submaximal exercise bicycle test do ass aerobic capability , 6 minute walk test , sit stand get go test do assess overall functional status physical therapy ( PT ) department . Those randomized exercise baseline visit , one repetition maximum ( 1 RM ) test . The 1 RM define maximal amount weight lift throughout full range motion . The 1 RM test perform exercise include calf raise , arm curl , lateral raise , knee flexor , bench press half squat . The 1 RM test repeat randomized exercise 8 16 week visit . After baseline investigation , subject randomize one two group ( exercise exercise ) 16 week . Strength training perform use standard free weight supervision train physical therapist member study staff . Each session begin 5 minute warm-up standard flexibility routine . The strength training routine follow focus follow muscle group : knee extensor hip extensor , ankle plantar flexor , elbow flexor , pectoralis shoulder abduction . The aerobic training program follow general guideline establish American College Sports Medicine . Training perform use standard stationery bicycle . Aerobic/endurance exercise perform large muscle group . The duration aerobic component training session 20 minute first two week 30 minute thereafter . The intensity exercise 60 % maximal heart rate first two week 75 % thereafter . As week progress , repetition intensity exercise gradually increase . Subjects return GCRC 8 week medical history , physical exam , weight , pregnancy test . Subjects return 16 week visit identical baseline .</detailed_description>
