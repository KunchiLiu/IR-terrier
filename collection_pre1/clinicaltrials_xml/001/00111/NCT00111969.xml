	<brief_title>ACCLAIM - Advanced Chronic Heart Failure CLinical Assessment Immune Modulation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence continue accumulate importance inflammation development progression heart failure ( HF ) . The Celacade™ system may reduce chronic inflammation stimulate immune system ’ physiological anti-inflammatory response . The ACCLAIM study international , approximately 2,000-patient , Phase III clinical research study design test safety efficacy Celacade™ system reduce risk mortality cardiovascular hospitalization patient chronic systolic HF .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male female age 18 old . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IV . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≦ 30 % , measure within past six month ( technique ) , unless cardiovascular event could modify LVEF period ( e.g. , coronary artery bypass graft [ CABG ] , myocardial infarction [ MI ] ) . If patient start betablocker biventricular pacing ( cardiac resynchronization therapy , CRT ) , LVEF measurement must least three month start therapy . Hospitalized heart failure ; OR , receive intravenous ( IV ) administration inotropic agent ( therapeutic dose HF ) , human Bnatriuretic peptide , IV diuretic ( minimum 40 mg furosemide equivalent ) clinic , outpatient emergency department within past 12 month ( stable least 2 week ) . Exceptions : patient NYHA Class III IV LVEF &lt; 25 % . On standard therapy congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , must include angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) ( unless contraindicate patient intolerant ) , without appropriate agent . If betablocker , patient must betablocker least three month . No change active cardiac medication heart failure two week prior randomization . Written inform consent Inability comply condition protocol . Presence transplant tissue organ leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) ( expectation within next 12 month ) . Planned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator ( AICD ) CRT within next 12 month . Acute MI , CABG , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , AICD , CRT within past three month . Need chronic intermittent inotropic therapy . Malignancy : evidence disease within previous five year . Exceptions : basal cell carcinoma , provide neither infiltrate sclerosing , carcinoma situ cervix . Active myocarditis early postpartum cardiomyopathy ( within first six month delivery ) . Systemic corticosteroid , cytostatics , immunosuppressive drug therapy ( cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , cyclosporine , azathioprine , etc . ) , DNA deplete cytotoxic drug take within four week prior study treatment . Pregnancy , patient childbearing potential use adequate contraceptive method . Porphyria . Allergy sodium citrate “ caine ” type local anesthetic . Previous Celacade™ treatment . Patient schedule hospice care . Clinically relevant abnormal finding clinical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , laboratory test screen assessment would interfere objective study would , investigator ’ opinion , preclude safe completion study . Abnormal finding could include : know HIV infection immunodeficiency state , chronic active viral infection ( hepatitis B C ) , acute systemic infection ( defined patient undergo treatment antibiotic ) , gastrointestinal tract bleeding , severe acute concomitant illness injury . Any medical , social , geographical factor would make unlikely patient could comply study procedure ( e.g. , alcohol abuse , lack permanent residence , severe depression , disorientation , distant location , history noncompliance ) .</criteria>
