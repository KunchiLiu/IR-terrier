	<brief_title>SIMPADICO - Study Immune Modulation Therapy Peripheral Arterial Disease Intermittent Claudication Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SIMPADICO multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial enrol 553 patient claudication 50 sit Canada United States . The mean ( ±SD ) patient age 67±10 year ; 72 % male . The duration claudication 6.0±6.1 year entry ; 91 % history smoke 34 % current smoker ; 36.5 % diabetes . Resting ABI 0.59+0.14 ; baseline ICD 132±104 ACD 307±209 meter . Results show increase ACD ICD 26 week immune modulation therapy ( IMT use Celacade™ system , Vasogen Inc. ) compare placebo measurable improvement quality life IMT compare placebo . However , significant decrease CRP ( high sensitivity assay ) ) IMT group compare placebo group . Conclusion : Immune modulation therapy improve walk distance patient symptomatic peripheral arterial disease decrease CRP suggest biologic effect IMT warrant study .

	<criteria>History intermittent claudication ( Fontaine stage II ) due peripheral arterial disease , stable ( clinically therapeutically ) 3 month prior screen . Resting anklebrachial index ( ABI ) least one limb ≤ 0.85 . For diabetic falsely elevate ABI due noncompressible tibial artery , toe brachial index ( TBI ) measure ≤ 0.7 rest . An absolute claudication distance ( ACD ) of≥ 50 meter confirm two consecutive visit least one week apart . The change ACD two consecutive assessment ( i.e . Visit 0 1 Visit 1 2 ) within ± 20 % . Walking distance must limit IC , confirm ≥ 20 % decrease ABI bad claudicating limb immediately follow screen treadmill test . The bad claudicating limb ( `` index leg '' ) define either ( 1 ) symptomatic leg ( 2 ) leg low rest ABI document prior first ( prescreening ) treadmill test . Postexercise rest ABIs compare within leg screening treadmill test . This criterion apply diabetic noncompressible tibial artery ( i.e . rest TBI measure patient ) . Age ≥40 year Women pregnant , lactating , childbearing potential use accepted contraceptive method , assess investigator . Clinically relevant abnormal finding clinical history physical examination screen assessment would interfere objective study would , investigator 's opinion , preclude safe completion study . Abnormal finding could include : hepatitis , HIV infection , AIDS , immune deficiency syndrome , serious active infection , gastrointestinal tract bleed severe acute concomitant illness injury . Critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) define ischemic rest pain , ulcerative lesion gangrene [ RutherfordBecker Classification Grade IIIII ( correspond Fontaine stage IIIIV ) ] . Previous endovascular surgical revascularization within 6 month prior study entry anticipate first 6 month study . Active inflammatory vascular disease ( e.g . Buerger 's disease ) . Major peripheral neuropathy , include severe diabetic neuropathy extent may interfere evaluation claudication . Any condition limit walk ability , claudication ( e.g . arthritis , angina , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] , etc . ) Malignancy within five year prior screen . Basal cell carcinoma , provide neither infiltrate sclerosing , carcinoma situ cervix exemption . Organ transplant recipient . Allergy sodium citrate , `` caine '' type local anesthetic . Systemic corticosteroid , antineoplastic immunosuppressive drug therapy ( e.g . cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , cyclosporine , azathioprine , etc . ) , DNA deplete cytotoxic drug take within 4 week prior study treatment . Currently take medication indicate intermittent claudication ( i.e . pentoxifylline cilostazol ) . To eligible , patient must take medication least 8 week prior study enrollment . Participation another study involve investigational license drug device 4 week precede enrollment study . Previous Celacade™ treatment . Any medical , social , geographical factor , would make unlikely patient comply study procedure ( e.g . alcohol abuse , lack permanent residence , severe depression , disorientation , distant location , history noncompliance ) .</criteria>
