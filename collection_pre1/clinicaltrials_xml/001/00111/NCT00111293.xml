	<brief_summary>The NIMH conducting study aim gain well understanding area brain involve different type mental process . This study focus brain region involve visual perception attention . Healthy normal volunteer people stroke undergone neurosurgery may eligible study . Candidates must 18 year age old , They must history psychiatric disorder , include depression , anxiety , psychosis , neurological disease stroke previous neurosurgery . Participants undergo follow test procedure four visit NIH Clinical Center : - Physical neurological examination depression rating scale . - Cognitive testing : Subjects complete write test , sit computer make decision show press key , answer question test examiner . - Behavioral training : Subjects practice perform cognitive task involve look make decision visual image appear computer screen . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : Subjects undergo MRI scan perform task previously practice . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During procedure , subject lie still 10 minute time table slide cylinder . The entire MRI scanning session take one hour . There multiple scan take 10 minute . They may ask return one two additional scanning session . During behavioral training MRI scanning , special piece equipment monitor eye movement may use . Some subject may ask return NIH additional visit participate magnetoencephalographic scan . This test use several sensor apply scalp measure small change magnetic field . This another way measure brain activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention require , , perceptual process . There converge body evidence single-cell recording study monkey neuroimaging , behavioral , clinical study human show processing attended information enhance relative processing unattended information . What source attentional modulation ? Because neuroimaging study demonstrate multiple cortical region recruit task involve selective attention , proven difficult thus far determine differential contribution region . A central goal propose research characterize contribution prefrontal cortex parietal cortex test hypothesis region exert top-down modulatory influence visual processing area . Specifically , wish investigate interaction area involve attentional control visual area modulate attention . We propose study patient focal lesion normal volunteer perform task require attention . Subjects participate , first , series behavioral study involve selective attention ; relative performance different patient group neurologically normal volunteer compare . Subjects also study perform similar task functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . We hypothesize selective attention heavily impaired lesion key prefrontal ( e.g. , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) key parietal ( e.g. , superior parietal lobule ) sit . We also expect brain imaging data show decreased activation visual region ipsilateral focal lesion prefrontal parietal cortex , thus provide evidence prefrontal parietal cortex source top-down modulation . Although research group compare behavior patient various focal lesion perform fMRI study visual attention neurologically normal patient , unaware concerted effort perform fMRI patient focal lesion order functionally isolate contribution individual cortical region serve critical node attentional network .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ALL SUBJECTS All subject volunteer 18 year age old . PATIENTS Subjects unilateral bilateral lesion prefrontal parietal cortex select participation behavioral brainimaging study describe within protocol . Control subject unilateral bilateral lesion temporal cortex also study . Finally , patient amygdala lesion also study test specific hypothesis outline Experiment 4 . In order obtain sufficient number focal lesion patient representative different brain region , patient different etiology study , provide damage circumscribed . The main etiology consider stroke , lobectomy , tumor . We restrict group include patient etiology , lesion location , lesion volume . Lesion location consider two hemisphere separately . Patients also nonamygdala subcortical lesion group separately patient corticalonly lesion . Our goal group patient focal brain lesion compromise single region ( e.g. , middle frontal gyrus ) patient massive damage ( e.g. , large extent superior , middle , inferior frontal gyrus ) . Focal lesion patient exclude basis medication . NORMAL VOLUNTEERS Neurologically normal , agematched volunteer recruit local community normal Clinical Center channel . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow criterion use exclude patient healthy volunteer participation study : Patients language impairment prevent understanding task follow instruction exclude . Patients WAISR FullScale IQ le 75 excluded . Patients severe cognitive dysfunction assess neuropsychological test . Subjects moderate severe depression assess Beck Depression Inventory ( score great 18 ) . Patients perform control task level performance control subject exclude . Subjects contraindication MRI scanning exclude test involves use MRI . These contraindication include subject follow device condition : ) central nervous system aneurysm clip ; b ) implant neural stimulator ; c ) implant cardiac pacemaker defibrillator ; ) cochlear implant ; e ) ocular foreign body ( e.g. , metal shaving ) ; f ) insulin pump ; g ) metal shrapnel bullet ; h ) implant device incompatible MRI . Subjects history neurological psychiatric disorder relate focal lesion ( e.g. , epilepsy , schizophrenia , etc . ) Subjects previous head injury related focal lesion . Subjects history drug alcohol abuse addiction ( determine qualify neurologist/psychiatrist ) . Subjects condition preclude entry scanner ( e.g. , morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc . ) include brain imaging study . Female subject childbearing age exclude brain imaging study pregnant refuse undergo urine pregnancy test . Subjects visual , auditory , motor , language problem would prohibit able properly perform visual attention task , understand instruction , indicate response , communicate experimenter via intercom system . Subjects undergone radiation treatment chemotherapy oneyear period prior experiment .</criteria>
