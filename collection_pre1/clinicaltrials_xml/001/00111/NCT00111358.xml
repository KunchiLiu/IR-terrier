	<brief_summary>This study design determine effect intensive lifestyle modification program patient HIV Metabolic Syndrome . The primary endpoint improvement body composition , specifically waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) . The secondary endpoint include improvement cardiovascular index , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , triglyceride cholesterol level , blood pressure , cardiac enzyme , c-reactive protein ( CRP ) , tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ) , insulin glucose metabolism . We expect quality life index life skill also improve lifestyle modification program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design randomize , case-control study 80 subject ( N=80 ) . Forty subject randomize observation group 40 intervention ( REACH ) group . After two initial screen visit medical nutrition staff inform consent , determination eligibility , evaluation 7-day food record , qualify patient see baseline visit . A nutrition questionnaire bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) test do first screen visit , sub-maximal stress test test physical therapy do second screen visit . At baseline , patient interval history physical exam , lipodystrophy evaluation investigator ( objective ) patient ( subjective ) report , blood test body composition . Nearly identical visit baseline , addition sub-maximal stress test , physical therapy testing , repeat 6 12 month . Carotid ultrasound repeat 6 12 month visit . There also short visit 3 9 month obtain interval history physical exam , safety lab , 7-day food record Intake Report . At baseline , patient randomize either observation group lifestyle intervention , know `` Reach Energy , Activity , Cardiovascular Health '' ( REACH ) . Randomization stratify gender fast glucose &lt; &gt; = 110 mg/dL . Those randomized observation receive one time counsel session nutrition staff baseline visit monthly , unscripted phone call investigator/co-investigator , come regular study visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , describe . Those randomized REACH attend one-on-one counseling session train dietitian cover `` core-curriculum '' model Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) study 16 week core curriculum intervention .</detailed_description>
