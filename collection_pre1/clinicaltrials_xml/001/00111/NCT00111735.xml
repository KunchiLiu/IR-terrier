	<brief_summary>The aim study examine effect fine titration thyroxine dosage symptom hypothyroidism , wellbeing quality life . The hypothesis symptom hypothyroidism , wellbeing quality life improve thyroxine-treated subject serum thyrotropin ( TSH ) suppress and/or low reference range , compare TSH upper reference range .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thyroxine Titration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary hypothyroidism common disorder , affect 2 % Australian population . The standard treatment thyroxine ( T4 ) , conventionally , serum thyrotropin ( TSH ) concentration within laboratory range take indicate adequacy thyroxine dosage . Some patient hypothyroidism complain persistently impair well-being , despite take thyroxine dose normalises serum TSH concentration . It clear whether comorbidity standard thyroxine replacement way inadequate individual . The reference range serum TSH wide ( currently 0.34-4.8 mU/L PathCentre ) . The distribution serum TSH concentration population skew , mean median low reference range approximately 1.0 mU/L . This lead argue serum TSH low reference range usual therapeutic target . Anecdotal evidence suggest thyroxine-treated patient feel well thyroxine dose adjust serum TSH low reference range rather upper reference range . The National Academy Clinical Biochemistry United States recommend , thyroxine-treated patient , serum TSH le 2.0 mU/L . There , however , evidence properly conduct study aim serum TSH concentration low reference range improve symptom hypothyroidism general wellbeing , proposal generally adopt . Only one study examine effect fine titration thyroxine dosage wellbeing publish . In study , patient significantly improve wellbeing take dose thyroxine 50 μg great biochemically optimal dose determine thyrotropin-releasing hormone test . In case , serum TSH suppress 0.2 mU/L ( limit sensitivity assay ) thyroxine dose improved wellbeing . This study open-label non-randomised , result therefore may affect bias . A well-designed , double blind study effect fine titration thyroxine dosage symptom hypothyroidism , wellbeing quality life require determine serum TSH low reference range , rather simply TSH within reference range , indeed usual therapeutic target thyroxine therapy primary hypothyroidism . It also desirable confirm finding Carr et al. , patient improve wellbeing TSH suppress normal level .</detailed_description>
