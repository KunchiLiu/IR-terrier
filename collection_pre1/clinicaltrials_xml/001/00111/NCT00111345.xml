	<brief_summary>Due progressive therapy intensification four consecutive study AML-BFM 78 , 83 , 93 98 , prognosis child acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) improve steadily . In spite intensified therapy , rate morbidity mortality remain unchanged even decrease . Against background 40 % patient still die immediate cause underlie disease relapse nonresponse , seem justifiable intensify therapy - especially high-risk patient - part require optimization supportive measure . As present risk stratification standard- ( SR ) high-risk ( HR ) patient prove effective , pursue risk-adapted therapy strategy . The aim study improve prognosis child AML intensification cytostatic therapy evaluate randomisation equivalence prophylactic central nervous system ( CNS ) irradiation total dose 18 Gy versus 12 Gy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During last decade , prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) childhood improve considerably , still 30 % child experience relapse disease 10 % fail respond sufficiently present therapy . A intensification therapy might improve overall survival child , possible , implicit side effect consider carefully . Increase dose intensification proven , effective anthracyclines limit risk cumulative cardiotoxicity . A liposomal formulation daunorubicin may offer possibility increase dosage , least partially , without cause cumulative cardiotoxicity . Objective one randomise study ascertain dose increase improve therapy response overall survival acceptable toxicity . The previous experience liposomal daunorubicin , gather relapse study AML-BFM Rez 97 International Therapy Study Relapsed AML 2001/012 well pilot study AML-BFM 2002P , show induction therapy feasible clinical center experience AML therapy without lead marked increase toxicity prolongation granulocytopenia . First result study AML-BFM 98 show patient standard risk ( SR ) group benefit additional , second induction ( HAM ) . On account reintroduce second induction course present study AML-BFM 2004 . However , SR patient take part randomisation initial therapy general view achieve high effectiveness . For patient high-risk group , administration 2-chloro-2-deoxyadenosine ( 2-CDA ) integrate first phase consolidation achieve even high intensification . It could show 2-CDA posse good antileukemic activity pediatric adult AML . In phase-II study could also demonstrate 2-CDA good effectiveness combination cytarabine . Results phase-II study conduct St. Jude Children 's Hospital , Memphis , show 2-CDA good effectiveness especially child monoblastic leukemia ( FAB M4/M5 ) . Consequently , intensification high-risk patient , present half case monoblastic leukemia ( FAB M4/5 ) , may allow improvement therapy cohort . The pilot study AML-BFM 2002P confirm study design practicable without increase significantly risk high toxicity . However , median duration aplasia significantly prolong comparison AI ( cytarabine , idarubicin ) -block . Objective two study determine randomisation improvement efficiency possible . Study AML-BFM 98 already focus question whether dos CNS irradiation 12 Gy 18 Gy equivalent regard capacity reduce risk relapse . As result study AML-BFM 87 confirmed necessity CNS irradiation , reveal necessary minimum dose , randomisation implement order prevent , far possible , late sequela CNS irradiation reduce radiation dose ( = objective three ) . As number patient study AML-BFM 98 sufficient resolve question , randomise analysis extend second period therefore continue current study AML-BFM-2004 . Besides intensification cytostatic therapy , study AML-BFM 2004 seek optimise quality supportive therapy implementing measure quality assurance . This demand up-to-date , complete documentation therapy phase . In study AML-BFM 93 98 , 12 % death due primary complication leukostasis syndrome , haemorrhage severe infection ( 4 % ) , infection aplasia achieve remission ( 4 % ) infection remission ( 4 % ) . Maybe live even child save future improve standard prevention primary complication . Further , efficacy chemotherapy could improve less delays therapy often due infection complication .</detailed_description>
