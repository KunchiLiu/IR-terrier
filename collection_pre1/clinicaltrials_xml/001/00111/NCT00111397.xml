	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria ( P-NTM ) ubiquitous organism cause isolate pulmonary disease otherwise healthy patient yet undefined susceptibility . Patients typically present history chronic cough , eventually progress hemoptysis , fever , hypoxia . With half patient fail standard three-drug therapy , insidious disease poor prognosis . Under natural history protocol nontuberculous mycobacterial infection ( NTM ; # 01-I-0202 ) , 46 patient diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease , 20 patient M. abscessus disease , 14 type mycobacteria ( M. fortuitum , M. massiliense , M. mucogenicum M. chelonae ) study . Numerous study suggest dysregulation cytokine production may make patient susceptible mycobacterial infection . Cytokines particularly important activation macrophage , help clear mycobacterial infection . Interferon gamma 1b ( Actimmune ) GM-CSF ( Leukine ) two cytokine therapy approve treatment chronic granulomatous disease post-transplantation hematopoietic reconstitution , respectively .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible protocol , patient must meet follow five criterion : Diagnosed M. avium complex ( MAC ) lung disease pulmonary mycobacterial infection base 1997 version American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) diagnostic criterion positive AFB smear culture mycobacterial infection least three month prior date enrollment . Patients histological evidence mycobacterial infection without positive smear culture qualify protocol even meet ATS diagnostic criterion nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection . A patient must radiographic evidence high resolution computerize tomography change consistent pulmonary mycobacterial infection . These include , limited : multiple small nodule ( less 5 mm ) , cylindrical bronchiectasis . The patient must treatment regimen base ATS guideline stable least three month . By stable , mean patient tolerate regimen without significant adverse reaction , new agent begin last three month . The patient must female postmenopausal ( either natural menopause surgical removal ovary ) menstruating . If patient still menstruate randomize study group receive cytokine must agree monthly pregnancy test , study , well utilize barrier type contraception abstinence . She must 40 year age time enrollment study . The patient must enrol protocol # 01I0202 ( `` Natural History , Genetics , Phenotype , Treatment NonTuberculoid Mycobacterial Infections '' ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pulmonary MAC disease meet entry criterion . Patients follow preexist medical condition : 1 . HIV positive 2. asthma 3. active cancer require treatment 4. hepatic disease ( define either history cirrhosis , grade 3 4 hepatic toxicity Toxicity Table Appendix II protocol ) Patients unable tolerate bronchoscopy . This define follow criterion : 1 . A pulse oximetry read less 100 % give supplemental oxygen 100 % FiO2 . 2 . Clinically significant reactive airway disease respond bronchodilator . Patients follow laboratory abnormality : 1. creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL 2 . Hemoglobin le 9 mg/dL 3 . WBC less 3,000 4 . Platelets le 150,000 5 . ALT great 82 U/L , AST great 78 U/L . 6 . Bilirubin great 2.0 mg/dL 7 . Alkaline phosphate great 232 U/L Patients preexist allergy history allergic reaction study protocol medication . These include , necessarily limit : IFNgamma , GMCSF , azithromycin/ clarithromycin , ethambutol , rifampin/ rifabutin , anesthetic agent employ bronchoscopy , yeastderived product . Patients unable maintain describe follow schedule . Likewise , patient unable give inform consent exclude study . Patients clinical diagnosis cystic fibrosis . Patients either currently smoking , previous history smoking exceed 20 pack year . Patients prior treatment either IFNgamma GMCSF within last three month . Patients known history cardiac , endocrine , neurologic medical condition principal investigator deem dangerous unsuitable enrollment exclude . Patients either pregnant lactating . Also , menstruate patient randomize study group receive cytokine refuse use appropriate barrier form contraception abstinence trial exclude . Patients , time trial , active lung infection cause either Staphylococcus gram negative rod exclude trial infection successfully treat . Patients need use supplemental oxygen . Patients Forced Vital Capacity le 40 % predict . Patients unable walk participate 6MWT .</criteria>
