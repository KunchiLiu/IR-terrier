	<detailed_description>Design Setting : The study randomize control trial . It conduct University Alberta Cross Cancer Institute Edmonton , Alberta , Canada . Participants : Participants 120 lymphoma survivor diagnose either non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) receive receive least 8 week chemotherapy Cross Cancer Institute Edmonton , Alberta . Participants stratify disease type ( indolent NHL versus aggressive NHL versus HD ) plan chemotherapy protocol ( chemotherapy versus &lt; 16 week versus &gt; 16 week ) , randomly assign either 12 week exercise program usual care . Eligibility : Participants recruit Cross Cancer Institute . The eligibility criterion include medical , demographic , logistic criterion , focus internal validity well external validity . Eligibility criterion study : ( 1 ) histologically confirm lymphoma cancer , ( 2 ) 18 year age old , ( 3 ) receive chemotherapy schedule receive least 2 cycle ( 8 week ) chemotherapy , exclude high dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant , ( 4 ) approval treat oncologist , ( 5 ) able understand provide write informed consent English , ( 6 ) uncontrolled hypertension , ( 7 ) uncontrolled cardiac illness , ( 8 ) active psychiatric condition , ( 9 ) contraindication exercise determine maximal fitness test conduct certified fitness consultant ( CFC ) . Recruitment : We recruit 122 participant trial . The study close accrual . Recruitment take place treatment follow-up consultation medical radiation oncologist . Interested survivor receive information package oncologist follow-up telephone call project director explain study answer question . All individual interested participate study : ( ) ask provide inform consent , ( b ) complete self administer questionnaire , ( c ) schedule maximal physical fitness test , dual-x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan , blood draw . The physical fitness test determine final eligibility study . Interventions : The exercise group perform supervise stationary cycle ergometer exercise 3 days/week 12 week progress 15 45 minute 60 % 80 % VO2 reserve course intervention . The usual care group ask begin structure exercise train program next 12 week receive exercise 4 week follow postintervention assessment . End Points : The primary end point change Trial Outcome Index QoL baseline postintervention . QoL assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Anemia ( FACT-An ) scale ( Trial Outcome Index : Physical Well-being , Functional Well-being Anemia Subscales ) . Secondary end point change psychosocial outcome , cardiopulmonary fitness , body composition , treatment completion rate . Cardiopulmonary fitness assess graded exercise test use gas exchange analysis . Body composition assess body mass index DEXA scan . Treatment completion rate assess number chemotherapy cycle receive divided number plan . Sample Size : Sample size calculation base primary end point . A clinically important difference ( CID ) TOI FACT-An 6.0 point . Sixty participant group allow u detect 10.0 point difference group change power .80 two-tailed .05 ( standard deviation = 18.0 point ) .</detailed_description>
