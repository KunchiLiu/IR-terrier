	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) frequent neurodegenerative disease prevalence 2 % 65 year high prevalence population age , major problem public health . An exhaustive repertory parkin mutation autosomal recessive form PD also know gene DJ-1 , PINK1 LRRK2 , major importance genetic counseling family affect PD physiopathological approach disease . Through French network study Parkinson 's disease genetics extend collaboration European , Mediterranean various country , total 2934 subject include 1683 patient 1251 unaffected individual collect since 2002 . These sample consist 122 family autosomal recessive PD , 285 case isolate early onset PD , 110 autosomal recessive 129 autosomal dominant family late onset PD , 201 isolate late onset PD case 250 matched control . DNAs subject available , lymphocytes lymphoblastoid cell line store patient France recently , fresh fibroblast obtain individual . The genetic approach autosomal recessive PD focus identification mutation parkin gene also screen DJ-1 , PINK1 LRRK2 gene .</brief_summary>
