	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn effect ( good bad ) celecoxib prostate cancer patient prostate cancer . This study look effect celecoxib prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level . PSA marker specific prostate cancer . An increase decrease level blood indicate patient 's prostate cancer get bad well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib ( Celebrex ) Versus Placebo Men With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study . These scientific research method use protect study personal bias prejudice . Patients participate study randomly assign initially take either celecoxib ( study drug ) placebo ( inactive substance look like study drug ) . Placebos use help determine result study ( good bad ) result chance treatment study drug . Patients fifty-fifty chance initial treatment study drug . Neither patient patient 's doctor know whether he/she initially receive study drug placebo . Participants assign initially take placebo may opportunity treat celecoxib later study . If patient find eligible study agree participate , randomize either receive celecoxib placebo take mouth ( pill ) twice day , every day long study . Patients give pill diary keep track medication . While study , ask take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , include over-the-counter ibuprofen many available drug . In addition , ask take selective COX-2 inhibitor ( class drug celecoxib ) . While study , patient evaluation ( physical exam blood ) determine response assign regimen monitor side effect . Once month follow perform : - Review side effect - Physical Exam - Routine blood test ( PSA level , kidney function ) . About one tablespoon blood take visit . Every month start month 2 : In addition evaluation , alternate month start month 2 , additional routine blood test ( liver function , complete blood count ) do . This require additional tablespoon blood take visit . Additional blood research-related testing ( 2-3 tablespoon ) also draw visit . Participation study determine well patient tolerate assign regimen disease responds . Patients continue take assign regimen 6 month long felt disease stable ( base PSA level ) tolerate treatment . After 6 month earlier , disease progress , treatment code break . If patient celecoxib , take study . The patient 's doctor discus available treatment option him/her time , include continue celecoxib `` study '' . If patient placebo , option begin take celecoxib . If patient start celecoxib treatment , treat study celecoxib 6 month disease progress . After 6 month celecoxib sooner , disease progress , take study . The patient 's doctor discus available treatment option him/her time , include continue celecoxib `` study '' . Patients take `` study '' monitor monthly patient safety reason throughout duration time receive celecoxib dose level use study ( 400mg twice day ) .</detailed_description>
