	<brief_summary>Experimental data suggest oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction key player pathogenesis diabetic nephropathy . In last year investigator able establish method assess endothelial function renal vasculature human start systematically study variety cardiovascular disorder know associated endothelial dysfunction vascular bed , include hypertension , hypercholesterolemia type-2 diabetes . In patient type-2 diabetes investigator could demonstrate despite unaltered basal stimulate NO-activity , renal response antioxidant vitamin C pronounce compare control subject . These data suggest oxidative stress increase renal vasculature diabetic patient . Furthermore , NO-activity diabetic patient appear upregulated compensate increase oxidative stress . This hypothesis support demonstration increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) expression kidney biopsy diabetic patient . The major focus investigator ' current research activity assess role endothelial dysfunction early stage diabetic nephropathy . To end , patient increase fast glucose metabolic syndrome study comparison age-matched control group . Endothelial function role oxidative stress assess renal vasculature group . In parallel , investigator study endothelial function forearm venous occlusion plethysmography retinal vasculature scan laser doppler flowmetry dissect regional difference regulation endothelial function . Further aspect include role microalbuminuria , glomerular hyperfiltration , endogenous inhibitor NO synthase NG , NG-Dimethyl-L-Arginine ( ADMA ) . In therapeutic approach , investigator determine effect various antioxidant treatment strategy endothelial function potential role prevention diabetic nephropathy .</brief_summary>
