	<brief_summary>American hemodialysis patient frequently malnourish . This contribute dialysis patient mortality rate high industrialized world 22 % per year . Poor nutritional status probably also contribute high health care cost ( average two hospitalization annually per patient total Medicare expenditures $ 11 billion per year ) diminish quality life . The researcher ' prior work identify several potentially modifiable nutritional barrier ( e.g . poor appetite , inadequate dialysis dose , poor nutritional knowledge , low fluid intake , need help shopping cooking ) pilot test promising approach overcome barrier . This propose community-based randomized control trial extend researcher ' prior work target specific nutritional barrier tailor feedback education intervention . Approximately 40 dialysis facility northeast Ohio randomly assign intervention control group , approximately 100 malnourish patient enrol 20 intervention facility 100 20 control facility . Baseline evaluation include measure nutritional status , specific barrier , inpatient expenditure , quality life . On monthly basis 12 month , intervention patient dietitian receive tailor feedback education overcome patient-specific barrier . They meet monthly jointly formulate care plan address barrier . Control patient continue get usual care . Major analysis compare change nutritional parameter intervention vs. control patient adjustment nesting patient within facility . The propose project test novel intervention target patient provider together make nutrition-related decision . Overcoming specific barrier may lead improve nutritional status also well patient survival , decrease health care cost , increase quality life .</brief_summary>
