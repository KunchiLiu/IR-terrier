	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect growth hormone replacement woman growth hormone deficiency . Growth hormone deficiency mean body longer produce growth hormone due tumor kind disease brain area call pituitary/hypothalamic region . This area brain growth hormone normally produce . We , researcher Massachusetts General Hospital , establish effect growth hormone replacement cardiovascular parameter ( laboratory test , flexibility artery , change heart rate ) woman growth hormone deficiency . Our goal see therapy : - effect woman 's cardiovascular risk marker ( special blood test indicate healthy heart artery ) - effect woman 's type level various substance circulate blood - woman affect stiffness artery heart rate variability parallel change cardiovascular risk marker - different effect depend whether woman pre post menopausal . Participation study expect last approximately 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate gender specific effect physiologic Growth Hormone ( GH ) replacement woman GH deficiency basis pituitary/hypothalamic region tumor , radiation , surgery cardiovascular risk marker arterial distensibility . Cardiovascular mortality growth hormone ( GH ) deficient adult show increased number retrospective study . Increased arterial intima-media thickness , increase prevalence atherosclerotic plaque endothelial dysfunction report growth hormone deficient adult childhood adulthood onset form . The growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) syndrome associate cluster cardiovascular-risk factor central adiposity , increase visceral fat , insulin resistance , dyslipoproteinemia decrease plasma fibrinolytic activity . GH administration effect number factor , unknown mechanism implicate GH action process atherosclerosis . In addition alteration atherosclerotic marker , abnormality cardiac function structure report among patient GHD possibly contribute increase cardiovascular mortality . In addition , GHD associate cardiac autonomic dysfunction may also contribute cardiovascular mortality improve GH replacement therapy . The vast majority study focus primarily men gender-specific effect GH replacement cardiovascular risk factor remain unknown . In addition interest term understand physiologic effect GH therapy , important therapeutic implication regard data woman . Cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality woman . Effects GH replacement bone density may less pronounced woman specific GH effect cardiovascular risk factor woman unknown , many adult woman GHD untreated . Long-term GH treatment decrease total body fat include visceral fat . Decreases central fat assess waist hip ratio report study , others . Administration GH cause insulin resistance acutely long-term therapy may restore glucose sensitivity . GH treatment increase lipoprotein ( ) ( Lp ( ) ) level effect lipoprotein still controversial . Some study report decrease LDL cholesterol without increase HDL cholesterol GH administration , others . Twelve month GH replacement improve leave ventricular mass cardiac performance young adult GHD . Key factor likely involved discrepant finding include heterogeneity patient study term age onset GH deficiency ( childhood versus adulthood ) , gender , severity GHD methodologic issue dose duration GH administration . In addition , many study control period . Inflammation play central role pathophysiology atherosclerosis . Each atherosclerotic lesion represent different stage chronic inflammatory process arterial wall different marker along inflammatory cascade report predict cardiovascular risk [ 34 ] . Among , high-sensitivity test C-reactive protein ( CRP ) one best validate . Several prospective study support strong link level CRP future risk coronary event . CRP add considerable value total HDL cholesterol measurement prediction cardiovascular risk . Other distal indicator inflammation serum-amyloid polypeptide A ( SAA ) likewise predict coronary risk . These distal marker reflect consequence elevate proinflammatory cytokine like interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . GH know important immunomodulatory effect . We therefore hypothesize effect GH process atherosclerosis might mediate cytokine-inflammatory pathway . We recently investigate effect physiologic GH replacement cardiovascular risk marker men GHD . In study find CRP IL-6 level decrease GH treat men compare control despite significant change serum lipid level . We also recently investigate level inflammatory marker woman hypopituitarism compare healthy control . We find woman hypopituitarism increase level IL-6 CRP suggest chronic inflammation may involve pathogenesis atherosclerosis population . It critical determine whether physiologic GH replacement beneficial effect woman , whether effect influence estrogen . We investigate effect long-term physiologic GH administration IL-6 , CRP , SAA well classic cardiovascular risk factor woman GHD randomize , placebo-controlled study . In addition , evaluate structural/function correlate woman measure arterial wall distensibility heart rate variability parallel cardiovascular risk marker . We establish gender-specific effect physiologic GH replacement cardiovascular risk woman GHD investigate whether therapy : 1. gender-specific effect cardiovascular risk marker 2. gender-specific effect lipid profile 3. alters heart rate variability arterial distensibility parallel change cardiovascular risk marker 4. different effect depend upon gonadal status</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GH deficiency due pituitary hypothalamic tumor disease affect area . Subjects treated medication , surgery , radiation , combination . GH deficiency define peak plasma GH le 5 ng/ml response insulin tolerance test growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) plus arginine stimulation test . In subject suspect hypothalamic dysfunction arginine plus Ldopa stimulation test may use , cutoff 1.7 ng/ml diagnosis GH deficiency . Partial GH deficiency define GH peak 5 9 ng/ml ( inclusive ) insulin tolerance test GHRH plus arginine testing . GH deficiency also diagnose insulinlike growth factorI ( IGFI ) level 2 standard deviation agesex normal range patient least two document hormone deficiency . Subjects must evidence stable pituitary mass ( least 12 month ) history tumor except case ACTHproducing microadenomas , followup imaging require cure . Subjects age 40 must screen mammogram already one within one year prior baseline visit Active Cushing 's disease within 1 year History acromegaly Untreated thyroid adrenal insufficiency . Subjects replacement therapy must stable least 3 month prior entry study . History malignancy except skin cancer except childhood solid malignancy document cure &gt; 10 year prior start study Hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 gm/dl Hepatic renal disease ( SGPT/SGOT &gt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl ) Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ( New York Heart Association 's classification system Class IIIV CHF exclude ) History unstable cardiovascular disease ( coronary artery cerebrovascular disease ) symptom within one year prior entry study Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy nursing Active carpal tunnel syndrome</criteria>
